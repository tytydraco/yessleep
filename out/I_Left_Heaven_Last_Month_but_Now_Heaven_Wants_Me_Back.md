Hey everyone.  
It’s Matteo again.  
Or what’s left of me, anyway.

If you read my last post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oeq6sj/i_was_sent_by_the_vatican_to_help_a_group_of/) about the “research mission” in Sweden, you know most of my story already.  
You know what I saw under the ice. You know about the thing that, at minimum, remembers being an angel. I thought the worst part was over when I got back to Rome. I was wrong.

\---

Three days ago, shortly after I made my previous post, I received a hand-delivered letter.

Same red wax seal, same Vatican crest, except this time there was another mark pressed beneath it, as if it had been stamped before the Vatican crest was stamped over it: a faint triangle inside a circle.

***“Return immediately for debriefing regarding the disappearance of Sister Lucia.”***

No signature.  
When I arrived, they didn’t take me to any office; I was led through a maze of corridors I had never seen before, and down a spiral staircase that delved deep beneath the city. I was brought into a dimly lit room. Within the room were two other people, one whom I recognized as my Bishop, and another man, whom I did not recognize, but seemed to be wearing a lab coat. My blood froze in my veins when I noticed the now familiar insignia emblazoned on the left breast pocket of the lab coat-wearing man. A triangle, with a circle surrounding it, touching at the three points.

"Sit, Matteo. We have much to discuss," my Bishop began, a grave look on his face, "This is Dr. Kruger, he oversees the facility where you were sent recently, and has brought some disturbing allegations against you." He finished.

Dr. Kruger smiled slyly and turned a laptop to face me.  "We have evidence to suggest that you were directly involved in Lucia's disappearance," he said, poison dripping from every word.

They showed me camera footage, presumably from the morning of my departure from Sweden. It showed the van that had picked us up from and dropped us back off at the airport, dropping *three* people back off, instead of just two. The camera feed switched to show another angle. This time, I could see the three figures walking down an otherwise empty terminal before the two on the outside grabbed the one in the middle and pulled them into a maintenance service door. The footage fast-forwarded, showing only two figures walking out.

In the video, it looked like Father Gabriel and I were responsible for Lucia’s disappearance.

I was unable to speak. The rage building in me had almost reached a fever pitch when the doctor continued.

"The other person of interest, whom you may know as Father Gabriel, has already agreed to cooperate with us in this 'investigation,'” he said, “It would be in your best interest to do the same. If you refuse, your Church will denounce you publicly. You’ll spend the rest of your life in a prison cell. Or worse, in one of ours.”

I looked to my Bishop for any sign of understanding; instead, I saw him looking at the floor, seemingly unable to make eye contact with me.

Then Dr. Kruger slid a folder across the table. Inside: a plane ticket north, and a single phrase typed on Vatican letterhead, with a wall of blacked-out text beneath it.

***“Theta-7 - Reactivation phase.”***

The doctor took my phone, and he and I departed that night.

\---

***"It looks like I'm headed back to Heaven."***

I thought to myself. I told myself I accepted because I wanted answers, but the truth is, I accepted because I was afraid; I had no doubt that they would be capable of framing me with the disappearance, and even less doubt that they would dispose of me at a moment's notice, if I didn't comply.

They flew me in under the same gray sky and drove me down the same road back to that same blasphemous mountain.

The sign on the road was still there, but this time it read slightly differently:

***“Welcome to Heaven, permanent population: 3.”***

The gate, which had already looked foreboding, now had a guard stationed on either side of it. Each guard was holding a rifle, and at their hip hung something that looked similar to the small metal detectors that one would see in an airport, being used by security, only these were seemingly coated in a shiny silver paint.

Inside, the chapel was rebuilt. The ice beneath the glass had been fully refrozen, and additional metal rings and wiring were installed within it. The observation deck around the chapel had been removed, and instead, a command center was placed just outside of the chapel doors, with line of sight and vocal access to the chapel. In the center of the chapel, surrounding the podiums where Gabriel, Lucia, and I once stood, was a snake of thick black wires, trailing out into the center of each wall of the room except the one on which the entrance was. Beyond the glass, I could see what appeared to be three metallic spheres, pulsating gently in a familiar pattern... Three pulses, a pause, then three pulses.

Erik met me in the hallway, thermos in hand. He looked thinner than before, eyes sunken, movements slower, as if the air itself weighed down upon him.

“Didn’t think you'd come back,” he said.

“Didn’t think I had a choice,” I replied.

A familiar voice came from behind me. “None of us did, kid.”

I turned and saw that Father Gabriel was standing at the end of the corridor, wearing the same threadbare coat as before, chewing away at his gum as usual. He looked worse than I remembered; hair gone gray, eyes sharp but hollow.

“They brought you back, too?” I asked.

“Apparently, the prodigal sons get round-trip tickets now, but I'm sure you know it wasn't a first-class seat,” he said with a bitter laugh.

Erik sighed. “Both of you, keep your voices down. The mountains have ears, you know, and we just so happen to be standing inside of one right now.”

He led us deeper into the facility, towards what I knew would be our new homes.

\---

Our quarters were in the same wing as before, though locks on the outside of the doors had been installed since our last visit. I guess what Gabriel said the first time we saw this place wasn't as far off as we had originally thought. Like before, the wing had three doors. Our two doors were open, but the third one was closed.

We were locked in our *cells* for the night. A lone guard patrolled outside our rooms, carrying an identical loadout to the ones guarding the front gate. My mind lingered on the strange silver device slung similar to how a nightstick would be on a police officer's belt. I thought to ask, but I doubt I would have received a proper answer.

That night, a folded slip of paper appeared under both our doors. No signature, just a symbol drawn in graphite: three concentric circles crossed vertically to the middle by a single line, with a solid circle in the very center.

And four words written beneath it:

***“The First Has Heard."***

\---

The next morning, Dr. Kruger assembled everyone in the rebuilt chapel. He stood at the command center like a general surveying a battlefield. Erik watched from a console nearby, expression unreadable. A sphere, similar to the ones embedded in the walls but smaller, sat alongside us in the center of the floor, pulsing the same pattern as the others.

“Today we resume resonance testing,” Kruger announced. “Fathers Matteo and Gabriel, as well as a modified RDC, designated RDC-L-1, will serve as focal conduits.”

Gabriel muttered, “Guess that’s our fancy new job title. Could have just labeled us 'bait.'”

They handed us printed sheets of meaningless syllables; vocal tones arranged like chants with no language.

Kruger called it a “Phase-Lock Chant.”

Gabriel squinted at the page. “So… we're speaking in tongues for science now?”

Kruger smiled thinly. “I suppose, if you prefer that terminology.”

They dimmed the lights, and we began to recite. The hum beneath the floor shifted with each line, syncing to our voices. Then a whisper surfaced under the noise:

***"Be not afraid."***

It wasn't the same voice from before. It was a feminine voice, soft, far away, as if I were hearing it from underwater. Gabriel stopped reading, visibly trembling.

"Keep cadence!” Kruger snapped.

We continued to recite from the page, but nothing else happened. It was as if the facility itself held its breath after that whisper.

Even Kruger looked uneasy, though he tried to hide it behind a professional scowl. Erik avoided my gaze, typing something rapidly into his console before shutting it off.

We were dismissed for “observation rest,” while the scientist poured over their data.

Back in the corridor, Gabriel leaned against the wall, his usual sarcasm gone.

“You heard it too, didn’t you?” he asked.

I nodded.

“Female voice. Calm, like she was teaching, not warning?” he continued the question.

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “And it didn’t feel quite as… judgemental.”

Gabriel laughed once, bitterly. “Good. Maybe our guardian angel finally showed up to apologize.”

Before I could answer, Erik appeared at the end of the hall, thermos in hand, face pale.

He motioned for us to follow him to a maintenance room.

Once the door shut, he locked it from the inside and leaned against a panel.

“You two need to forget that voice,” he said. “Pretend it never happened.”

Gabriel frowned. “You heard it too, didn’t you?”

Erik didn’t answer right away. He took a slow sip of coffee, staring at the floor.

“Yeah,” he said finally. “I’ve heard her before. Most of us who’ve been here long enough have. We just don’t talk about it.”

He rubbed his eyes, looking suddenly old.

“We call her the First Witness. The name isn’t official. It’s… Purist folklore, really. They say she was the first person ever to be assimilated into the Field, long before Theta-7 was even built. Before the schism, even. Some think she’s still in there, a permanent part of it now.”

Gabriel crossed his arms. “And you believe that?”

Erik looked at him. “Some part of me wants to. The alternative is even more terrifying... That it *is* *her* voice, but it isn't *her* speaking with it.”

Later that night, I found a small notebook slid under my door. There was no symbol on it this time, but someone had written one sentence in English, with careful handwriting:

***“Her name is Anja.”***

Inside were dozens of entries, scrawled in different inks and styles. Half were impossible to read; just equations, sketches of circles, triangles, or strings of numbers.

But one line, four words repeated over and over, stood out:

***"The Second Has Answered."***

I showed it to Gabriel the next morning.

He flipped through a few pages and sighed. “Looks like we’re officially prophets in the  madhouse now, they've even given us pamphlets.”

\---

Kruger called us to the chapel again before lunch. He didn’t mention yesterday’s voice. No one did. This time, the sphere in the center glowed brighter, the rhythm faster; three pulses, pause, three again, like before.

I could feel it in my chest.

We began the chant. Halfway through, Erik’s monitor emitted a shrill tone. He shouted something to the technicians, but they didn’t move fast enough. The hum deepened, vibrating through the floor, the walls, the marrow in my bones.

Then I heard it again. Not the soft, feminine voice from yesterday, but the booming, thunderous voice from our first stay in Sweden.

***“The light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.”***

Everyone froze.

Kruger screamed, “Maintain cadence!” but his voice was drowned out by the thundering of the entity's, and the screaming of alarms. The glass under our feet rippled like water. A figure took shape in the reflection; six wings of light and shadow, eyes scattered across them like stars.

Gabriel whispered, “Christ have mercy…”

The moment he spoke, the reflection looked up.

\---

The alarms blared, every light turned blood-red. Erik grabbed Kruger by the collar.

“Shut it down! It's feeding on the resonance decay from L-1!"

Kruger gasped, “We're prepared this time, the lattice will hold!”

“We weren't prepared for it to consume a near *infinite* source of resonant energy!” Erik shouted, throwing Kruger aside and running for the emergency panel.

The hum fractured into words again. Two voices, spoken as if they were two members of the same choir; the woman’s voice, soft but powerful, and the voice of a man that I did not recognize, deep and sincere, filled the room:

***“We await His arrival.”***

At that moment, the visages of a man and woman appeared above the sphere in the center of the room. The figures floated through the air above the sphere.

The reflection of the entity in the glass below us vanished, and, in an instant, a third human-shaped form appeared alongside the man and woman, similar to them but bright. Brighter than the sun. Brighter than anything I'd ever seen. I could vaguely make out the form of a single halo now encircling the heads of all three figures.

There was a flash of green, and all three began to *unravel* into strings of light. The strings of the two human visages, dim in comparison to the angelic glow of the third who had joined them, wound around each other and descended toward the sphere below.

Shortly after, the string from the entity joined the newly helical structure, weaving in between the two and binding them together. The sphere continued to pulse, but when the helix met with it, the color changed instantly; it pulsed a deep, forest green instead of the usual red.

Erik threw the switch on the emergency panel, immediately darkening every light source except for the bright green sphere in the center of the room, which had now left the tripod it was sitting on and drifted upwards between the figures, unraveling into it.

"I was too late!" Erik shouted from the emergency panel, "It's self-sustaining, and the entity has gained full control of L-1's energy output!"

"This is unprecedented," Erik gasped, "no entity has ever attempted to interface with an RDC directly before... they're literally designed to *nullify* Field resonance..."

"That's because it's not *just* an RDC, it's a *synth..."* Kruger started, but was cut off by another choir of voices, this time the *combination of all three of the voices from before*: 

***"For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it."*** 

***---***

The air split open.

Light erupted from the sphere, no longer green but shifting through every color at once. Radiant, fluid, impossibly alive. It wasn’t brightness so much as structure: columns of illumination spiraling upward, intertwining, unspooling, and reforming into impossible geometry that my eyes refused to hold.

For a heartbeat, I could see them; the two human visages from before, still suspended above the sphere, their forms no longer made of flesh or flame, but of vibrating matter and energy. Their outlines folded inward on themselves, weaving together, their luminous strands twisting in perfect mirrored motion.

The light didn’t just rise, it climbed, self-replicating in infinite recursion, folding in on itself like hands folding in the sincerest prayer. Each movement of one line was echoed by the other, creating a lattice of living brilliance that seemed to hum with intelligence.

Somewhere between those two converging threads, a third form began to grow; not emerging from, but being born out of the sphere that their essences wound into. Wings unfolded in fractal patterns. Each feather refracting the light of a thousand collapsing novae, edges rippling with translucent fire. It was beautiful in the way that an erupting volcano might be: inescapable, inevitable, and deeply unsettling.

The figure stabilized in mid-air, the combination of all three previous figures, green sphere shimmering in the center of it where a heart would it. Six wings fully extended, its body a convergence of reflection and void; half blinding, half shadow. Every surface shimmered with shifting symbols that glowed, then vanished, then returned again in different sequences, as if the air itself were writing and erasing scripture faster than it could be read.

It looked alive, but it didn’t breathe. Instead, the whole room seemed to inhale and exhale for it, every pulse of resonance feeding its existence.

The air grew heavy, and I could feel the pattern of its heartbeat inside my chest.

Three pulses. Pause. Three again.

Behind the radiance, I caught the faintest glimpse of its face or what passed for one. Eyes, infinite in number, turned outward, as if gazing not at us, but through us. And for a moment, *just a moment*, I thought I *recognized* that face.



***"Lucia?"*** Gabriel and I asked in unison.



The entity spoke, not with a voice, but with vibration; an all-consuming resonance that shaped itself into words older than language.



***"Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in this place; escape from the mountain, lest thou be consumed."***



That was when the world began to tremble.

\---

The hum became deafening. The entire chamber pulsed with blinding green-white light as the entity’s wings folded inward, then snapped open again as if attempting to crack the firmament itself.

Erik’s voice cut through the chaos.

“The lattice is feeding it! The whole mountain is coming apart! If we don’t move now, we’ll be part of the next testament!”

He yanked a manual override lever on the wall. A series of klaxons screamed to life, and the containment doors around the chapel began to slam shut one by one as pressure built beneath the floor.

“Move!” Erik shouted. “Sublevel access hatch, now!”

Gabriel and I ran first, half-blinded by the light, Kruger close behind us, cursing in German between gasps for air. The steel grates beneath our feet glowed red-hot, warping from the energy. The hum had turned into a heartbeat you could feel in your skull.

We reached the narrow sublevel corridor. Erik dove through last, slamming the hatch behind him as the final seal above failed with a thunderous crack.

A sound like tearing fabric echoed through the mountain; a sound so loud and low it felt like the earth itself was screaming.



Then it happened.



The mountain burst open.



The entire upper structure of Theta-7 erupted in a column of molten light that tore through the stone, splitting it cleanly down the middle. 

Rock, steel, and decades of secrecy were obliterated in an instant, vaporized in a flash of green and white.

The shockwave hit us like an invisible truck. Shrapnel from the supports embedded itself in my back, and I felt a searing pain where flames had just licked at my ankle. The tunnel we were in collapsed behind us in slow motion, stone turning to vapor before it even touched the floor. We stumbled out through a maintenance shaft, barely able to see. The air was a haze of fire and snow. From the exit at the base of the mountain, we could see open sky, quickly being covered by a cloud of debris, with flashes of lightning following shortly behind it.

A figure, vast, radiant, and terrible, rose from the fissure, its six wings unfurled like curtains of light stretching across the storm. Every wingbeat sent sheets of snow and debris cascading down the slopes. Around it, the clouds turned to gold, the sky split open, and the air turned electric with the taste of copper.

We ran. The mountain behind us groaned, the snow beneath our boots glowing from the reflected light. The hum followed us: three pulses, pause, three again. Steady, relentless. We looked back, and a wall of fire was close behind, and gaining on us by the second.

Kruger lagged behind, clutching his briefcase to his chest. Erik pulled him over the edge of a ridge where we had taken cover from the blast coming our way, and tried to hold him to the ground, but Kruger tore himself free, stumbling to the ridge and turning toward the mountain. The words tore from his throat, half prayer, half disbelief.

***“My God... it’s beautiful…”***

The fire swallowed him.

For a second, I thought he had been simply annihilated in the blast, but, as the fire passed, we looked up and saw what had become of him. Standing there, rigid and glittering in the radiant green of the pillar of fire, was a Kruger-shaped pillar of salt. Only his briefcase remained, which Erik promptly grabbed.

We got up after the fire had passed and started back running. We sprinted through the storm until our lungs burned, until the ground stopped shaking and the light behind us began to fade. Only when the sound of collapsing stone gave way to silence did we finally stop.

The wind carried a faint hum, softer now, distant. The mountain was gone. In its place stood a crater rimmed with glowing glass.

Gabriel fell to his knees. “Was that… judgment?”

None of us could speak to comment, but I think we all felt the same.

The clouds above us began to close, the auroras fading, leaving only the faint green shimmer dancing across the sky.

Erik turned to face the crater one last time, thermos still clutched in his hand. His voice trembled as he spoke.

“If that was judgment, then I have my own sins to atone for.”

He dropped the thermos onto the snow, steam hissing where it landed.

“Let’s go,” he said quietly. “I know somewhere we will be safe."

\---

I'm posting this now from my own cellphone, which, thankfully, was inside of Kruger's briefcase. There were other things in the briefcase that Erik is still trying to make sense of. Things that, according to him, are *far* worse than just what happened to Father Gabriel and me. 

Erik led us to the main road, where we managed to hitchhike back to a city; we told the terrified driver who picked us up that we were involved in a lab explosion out in the mountains... which wasn't *entirely* false, in our defense. We were dropped off at the hospital, where my ankle and back, as well as various injuries to Father Gabriel and Erik, were treated.

From the city, we made our way back towards the mountains in a minivan purchased with Kruger's organization credit card. "They won't miss a few this much money, not after a literal mountain *full* of cutting-edge tech worth *billions* just exploded." He had said, in an attempt to justify the action. Honestly, neither Father Gabriel nor I felt the need to justify it after today.

Instead of going back to Heaven, Erik took us to a cave, tucked deep into a ravine between two mountains. A sign outside of it read, in hand-painted letters:

***"SALVETE AD PURGATORIUM"***

And, in smaller letters below,

"**Quod purgatur, vivet."**

I could hear an audible sigh from Father Gabriel as we entered the cave, then his usual humor broke the tension: 

***"Well, Lucia is a prophet, confirmed."*** 

I don't think I'll be going back to Rome. Erik has agreed to answer a *long* list of questions I have about this whole experience, but let's save that for another day- it's well into the witching hour here, and I'm sure we could all use some rest.

Until next time,   
Your favorite man of the cloth,  
*Father Matteo.*
