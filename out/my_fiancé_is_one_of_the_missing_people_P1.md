I was 19 when I met the love of my life, Clara, she was perfect. Every nerdy love I had that I thought made me disgusting to women she also loved, anime, star wars, superheroes she also loved, I didn't even have to hide my collection of action figures and other collectables because she had one too. It was deeper than that though I gathered up the courage to ask her out when I was 20 and she agreed, and soon after I discovered are similarities ran deeper than our silly hobbies, we both wanted the same things in a forever home we both wanted to start a family early, she wanted to be a teacher and I supported it because I thought that meant she would only be gone when our kids would be at school and would be home the rest of the time, and she supported me in my career in construction and architecture because she thought it meant I could build her our dream home and make every detail perfect. I asked her to marry me a year after we started dating when I was 21 and she said yes, I knew she would be my wife since the moment we met it only took this long because I needed the courage but also I wanted to make it special so I waited till our anniversary. Sadly our wedding would never come, as shortly after she agreed she disappeared from her apartment in the middle of the night, no sign of a break in, her ring camera showed her entering her apartment but never showed her leaving, her apartment was to high up for her to leave through the windows, she was just gone without any trace without any idea where she could be or how her or any potential kidnapper could have pulled this off without any camera or any witness catching them.  
This broke me especially after I found out the cops had given up when they discovered there weren't any leads to follow, but I knew she had to be alive, I always had a really good intuition, i could always trust my gut, and my gut was telling me she was out there, scared, praying someone would find her, and I wasn't going to let those prayers be unanswered. So I started to look, I had no investigative experience and it wasn't even a skill I was good at. As a child I always sucked at riddles but I had to try, I started the only place I could think of, the ring camera footage. I looked over every hour on the camera from the night she disappeared listening for any little noise that could give me a clue any person walking by that the police hadn't already talked to that could have any information, any strange detail, nothing. There was nobody that walked the room no noises just silent stillness, and that's when it hit me it was too odd for it to be this still someone at some point would have to walk by or you'd think the lights would dim at some point but for most of the night it was practically a still image, like it was on a loop. This was on purpose, someone had taken her.
