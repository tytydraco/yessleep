The facility smelled like bleach and seawater. It always did in facilities this deep.

Our boots echoed against the concrete hallway as we stepped off the elevator, each of us dragging a duffel bag behind us, filled with cleaning supplies, forensic gear, and – just in case – guns. Apparently we wouldn’t need them, but protocol demanded it.

We were called in for “containment failure cleanup.” That’s what the official order sheet said. There was no other information; no names, details or dates. I’d done enough of these to know what that phrasing meant: something had broken loose, and *everyone* inside was dead.

Our squad had five members. Sergeant Halvar led, his voice always calm, even when his hands shook lighting a cigarette. Following him were Kelly and Rob, both armed and scanning every shadow. Reyes, the medic, stood far back. And then there was me, just another “Special Cleaning Technician” as far as the paperwork was concerned.

But believe me when I say, we weren’t cleaning anything. Instead, we were burning evidence.

We passed through the first decontamination chamber and into a hallway full of shattered glass and overturned equipment. There were no bodies yet, which was a relief.

“Same drill as last time,” Halvar said. “Photos, tags, take everything. Leave nothing here.”

I nodded, and so did everyone else, but I could see it in their eyes. If this was the “same drill as last time,” then there’d be bodies soon enough.

The hallway bent to the left, and we found the first streak of blood. It ran along the wall like someone had been dragged, then abruptly stopped in front of a door.

“Doesn’t look like a breach,” Kelly muttered, and refused to make eye contact with the Sergeant.

Rob flashed his light along the ceiling. “Then what the hell shattered the glass?”

I didn’t speak up then, but I agreed with Kelly. There were no alarms blaring and no red lights that signaled danger. For a containment breach, this seemed to be too clean.

Halvar didn’t respond. He raised a hand and ordered us to move along.

We passed through another checkpoint. The security door was unlocked, and its biometric scanner was shattered, with no burn marks or claw marks like we’d seen in other facilities where things had gotten loose.

“I don’t like this.” Reyes whispered, her voice filled with anxiety. “Something feels wrong.”

Kelly glanced back at me as we walked. “You ever notice these jobs get stranger every month?”

“Depends what you mean by ‘stranger’. This is already strange enough.”

She smirked, trying to hide her worry. “Weirder, as in… fewer accidents, more orchestrated ones.”

Halvar shot her a sharp look. “That’s enough. I won’t tolerate any wild theories you might have.”

But Kelly wasn’t done yet. “Come on, Sarge. You’ve surely noticed it too, by now. They’re not containing these things anymore, just playing with them. And people are dying for it. And let’s not forget, the general public is starting to find out--”

“Shut it,” Halvar growled, his voice serious. I could see Kelly visibly gulping before deciding to drop the topic.

The hallway opened into a wide lab space, and we all stopped at the same time. All we saw were rows of desks, scattered papers, and blood pooled beneath an office chair.

But still no bodies.

Kelly let out a bitter laugh. “Of course. This Subject truly is one of a kind if it ate *everyone*.”

Halvar signaled for us to spread out. We moved carefully, scanning the corners and every piece of furniture.

“Guys?” Reyes called softly from across the lab. She was kneeling near one of the shattered observation windows, her flashlight aimed inside the containment chamber.

I moved closer, stepping over scattered glass, trying to keep my eyes on the windows. The heavy reinforced door was wide open, its hinges bent inward like something had forced it *out*, and not in. A single, deep scratch marked the floor in front of it.

Halvar crouched beside it, running a gloved finger along the mark. There was something on his mind that he wouldn’t say out loud.

“What, Sarge?” Kelly asked mockingly. “You finally believe me? This is bullshit.”

Reyes slowly backed away from the window. “This couldn’t have been a breach. Maybe they *let it* *out*.”

Halvar finally snapped and shouted back, mostly at Kelly. “For the love of God, stop theorizing. We’re just here to clean, that’s it.” He turned back around and stepped into the chamber. “Check everything. I want a full sweep.”

The chamber itself was clean, with only the faint smell of chemicals differentiating it from the rest of the facility. It was quite large, which did urge my mind to wander – just what were they keeping in here?

“It’s just too clean,” Reyes remarked. “There’s no spray pattern, no debris. It seems staged.”

Kelly kicked over a bucket placed in the corner of the chamber. “And *we’re* the ones sent in to ‘clean up’ their crime scene. Typical from the Order.”

Rob shook his head. “You don’t know that.”

“Don’t I?” Kelly laughed. “Look around. There’s absolutely no proof a breach even took place here. I heard the Officer started growing paranoid, but--?”

As soon as ‘Officer’ left Kelly’s mouth, Halvar rushed over to her corner. “I swear, kid, if you don’t shut up, I’ll make sure *he’ll* be your next challenge.”

After a brief moment of silence, he regained his composure, and continued. “As I said. We don’t speculate. We follow orders.” Although this time, I could hear his voice didn’t carry its usual confidence.

As we pushed deeper, we found more signs that confirm Kelly’s theory: doors unlocked, not forced open, that should’ve been sealed; containment tools scattered neatly like they’d been placed there; and more streaks of blood that led nowhere.

Then, at the end of a corridor, another security door loomed. A bold red card read **AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY – APEX ACCESS REQUIRED.**

“Apex access?” Rob whispered. “I’ve heard of them, but…”

“Never seen one.” Halvar interrupted. “And I’ve been working under the Order for a while.” He checked his wrist device, then shook his head. “Not in our orders though. So, we don’t touch it.”

Kelly stared at the sign for a long moment. “Convenient, isn’t it? You really think whatever’s in there isn’t connected to this?”

Halvar’s response was quick. “I told you. Not in our orders. Drop it.”

“Yeah, because they never put the important shit in our orders,” Kelly almost shouted, stepping closer to the door. “They send us in blind so we don’t ask questions. Ever thought about that, Sarge?”

Rob shifted awkwardly, glancing back the way we came. “Kelly, come on--”

“No,” she interrupted, pointing a finger at the red card. “I’m done walking past doors like this and pretending it’s not where all the answers are.”

Reyes cleared her throat. “She’s not wrong. This whole place stinks of something, and it’s not bodies. This is clearly a fake breach, and the orders are *too* enigmatic, even for Order-standards.”

Halvar shot her a glare, but he didn’t say anything. His silence was confirmation enough.

“Fuck it,” Kelly muttered. “We’re opening it.”

She moved toward the door, but before she could do anything, Halvar spoke up. “Probably. You’re probably right, okay?” He stepped forward, lowering his voice. “But orders are orders, Kelly. You open that door and it’s *our* necks. They’re unpredictable – hell, they’ll probably kill us for looking inside.”

That seemed to hit a nerve in Kelly’s mind. She froze, her eyes wide open as she listened to Halvar’s words.

“Look, I get it. I do. But if we go off script here and open that door, there’s no coming back. You want to be next on their list? This’ll get us all killed.”

She put her hands over her eyes, as if trying to hide her shame – not because she realized what she was doing was stupid. But because she didn’t *care* if it could kill us.

“Maybe. Or maybe we find out what they don’t want us to see”

She glanced at the access panel, then at the hinges. We didn’t know the code, and the screen was dead. She unhooked a breaching tool from her vest and prepared to slam it against the door.

Reyes looked scared, but curious as to what was inside. Rob was trying to convince Halvar to stop her, but the sergeant didn’t move. He just watched Kelly with eyes that reflected something I hadn’t seen from him before.

Dread.

The loud clang echoed through the hallway.

“Kelly--” Rob hissed, but to no avail. She wouldn’t stop until it was open.

Another slam. This time, the metal dented. A third, and the locking mechanism gave up.

Reyes placed her hands together. “We’re so fucked.”

The door squealed as Kelly shoved it open, the smell of blood hitting us instantly.

Kelly picked her flashlight up and pointed it in, the beam reaching to the end of the room.

“Blood,” she whispered. “A lot of it.”

We stepped inside, one by one, our boots echoing against the steel floor.

Five bodies slumped against the wall, their lab coats shredded and filled with bullet holes. Their ID tags glinted in the light.

“Execution-style,” Halvar said under his breath, crouching. “Close range.”

Kelly swore quietly. “A ’breach’ my ass. This was planned.”

“Why stage it? Why send a rookie team here to clean it up?” Reyes asked, her voice shaking from fear as she approached Halvar.

“They wanted us to believe it,” he replied. “And they wanted to *test us*. To see if we’re loyal.” He flashed his light around the room, squinting his eyes. “And now that we’ve seen this… we’re not getting out of here alive.”

Before anyone could react, something slammed down from above. Kelly didn’t even scream – one second, she was there, breaching tool still in hand, and the next her body was yanked up into the shadows, never to be seen again.

“Contact!” Rob roared, his rifle lighting up the room as he tried to shoot the Subject.

I stumbled back, searching for my handgun around my waist, still in a state of shock. I’m not sure, but I think I saw it – a slick, black shape running along the ceiling. It was small, a bit bigger than a cat, and its movements were too fast to track. Kelly’s body thudded somewhere in the dark.

“Disengage!” Halvar screamed, his voice filled with panic. “MOVE, NOW!”

Reyes grabbed my arm and yanked me toward the door, while behind us, Rob kept firing at the agile creature, which was already gone from his sights.

Something heavy slammed against the wall near us, but I didn’t look back to check what it was.

“Keep moving!” Halvar continued, his voice quieter now.

The corridor which we came from now looked narrower and deadlier. The only sound from behind was Rob still shooting it in short bursts. But, that also stopped.

“Rob?” I shouted over my shoulder.

There was no answer. The only thing I could hear was the sound of claws skittering across the floor – moving towards me. Halvar turned around just in time and shone the flashlight at it – its skin was black and slick, like it had just clawed its way out of a womb. Its head twitched unnaturally, maybe due to the light, and it recoiled as we saw it.

“Don’t stop,” Halvar snapped, grabbing my arm and dragging me along. “Don’t stop, or he died for nothing.”

We heard something wet from above us – the creature was closing in.

I pushed harder, Reyes a few steps ahead and Halvar right next to me. We started running back towards the entrance, but it was faster than us. “Where the hell do we go?” I asked.

“Here!” Reyes shouted from the front. She pointed towards a small containment storage. “If we seal the doors, we’d have a chance!”

Although I didn’t like the idea, there was no other option. Reyes made her way inside, me and Halvar following close behind. The sound of claws scraping after us suddenly seized – and the silence afterward gave me more anxiety than before.

I turned just in time to see the creature jump into view, allowing me a better view of it. I can’t really explain it, but it looked *new*. Born of something the Order had no right to tamper with.

Halvar slammed the door shut, the mechanism locking it into place. We stood in a pitch-black storage room, catching our breaths.

 “You realize what this means,” Halvar whispered between his breaths.

“What?” Me and Reyes both asked.

“There really was no breach. That thing didn’t get out on its own. They – the Order – *put it here*. So if we misbehave…”

He didn’t finish, but he didn’t need to. We all knew what he wanted to say. It was a trap all along.

Suddenly, something slammed against the door with great power. Reyes swore under her breath, slowly backing away. “It’s… it’s coming through.”

Halvar stood there, his breathing finally calmed down. “You two…” He spoke, but his voice was too steady and calm for a situation like this. “…you run the second I open this door.”

“What the hell are you--? Don’t be stupid Halvar!” I replied, trying to convince him to rethink.

He looked at me and gave me a smirk of approval. “As I said… the Order’s unpredictable. But me? I’m not. And I’m done following their lies and keeping silent. If one of us doesn’t hold it here, none of us survive.”

Before I could grab him, he opened the door – just a tiny bit, but enough for the Subject to lunge through.

“Go!” Halvar roared, shoving me and Reyes through as the creature was still figuring out the new environment. His gun lit the room in flashes as we stumbled away, growing fainter and fainter as he slowly closed the door behind us.

It was a long minute Reyes and I stood there, watching the door in silence. We hoped for… something. Anything, really. A scream, a screech, some type of signal either from Halvar or from the creature itself. But apart from a gunshot that echoed through the facility as the door slammed behind us, everything was quiet.

Me and Reyes looked at each other, neither of us speaking, and began walking to the entrance. The containment chamber, the security checkpoints, the entire facility. It all made sense now. And when we stumbled out of the facility, we were met with the worst possible scenario.

Black vans parked along the road, their lights cutting through the light rain. Order personnel in wet gear stood waiting in two rows.

A man in a black coat stepped forward – for a moment I thought it was the Officer. But no, just one of his messengers. He had a kind of coldness and callousness in his eyes, which told me he knew of everything that happened inside.

“Interesting,” he said, his voice flat. “So you’re the only ones left.”

I couldn’t breathe properly, though I didn’t really have anything to say to him. Reyes tried to object, but the man held up a gloved hand.

“You’ll say it was a containment breach,” he continued. “You’ll both sign the reports. We need witnesses, and that’s the role you’ll fill.”

Reyes swallowed. “But it wasn’t--”

The man’s gaze cut to her, powerful enough to silence her instantly. “You don’t want to finish that sentence.”

He took a step closer. “Your families live under our roof. Your life, your food, your homes… all provided by the Officer. If either of you suggests otherwise…” He took a deep breath, letting the silence drag and the pressure thicken. “…well, let’s not get hostile.” He offered a fake smile, then patted us both on the shoulder.

He turned around and signaled something to the guards. “Remember this. A breach killed the researchers. The same Subject killed your crew. It devoured them. And you’re lucky to be alive.”

Reyes was shaking beside me, but I understood, as I was too. I forced myself to nod. “Understood, sir.”

“Good. Get them cleaned up and processed.”

That was the last thing he told us before getting into a car and driving off, leaving us with more than the feeling of despair. The rest of the guards made us fill out the form – and just as the man said, we cited a “containment breach”. Maybe you could argue I could’ve fought back. But believe me, you don’t know *what* these people are and how much power they hold. Fighting back against them is plain stupidity.

Me and Reyes knew we hadn’t really survived in the way we wanted to. We were rewritten, and now serve as puppets to the [Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/).
