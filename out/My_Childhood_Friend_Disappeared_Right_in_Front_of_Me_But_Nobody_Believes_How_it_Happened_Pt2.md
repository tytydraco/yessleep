Hello all. As alluded to in my first post, the disappearance of my childhood friend, Tim, was only the beginning of my nightmares. As a side note, I apologize for not responding to any comments in the original post. Just writing this is nerve-wracking enough… but I’ll try my best and respond this time. And for those of you not caught up with everything, here is the original post:

The next chapter in this ever-unfolding tale of terror takes place just a couple of years after the initial vanishing. I was around eight-years-old at the time, and from what I can remember, was in third or fourth grade. It had been a little over two years since that Summer day and we were in the middle of the Fall. Most people, whether on purpose or simply due to the passing of time, had forgotten about the missing kid who “fell into a puddle.” Hell, even I had forgotten about it. I’m definitely ashamed to say so, but I left Tim behind, and I can’t deny that fact. No weirdness had taken place in those two years. The town went back to normal, as if Tim had never lived there in the first place.I was in school on a crisp autumn day, and the leaves had just started falling. The grassy green pigments I was used to had now turned into all different shades of yellow, brown, and red. My friends and I used to always dive right into the leaves and we’d play hide and seek till the sun went down. I was super excited that day because the piles of leaves were massive, like mini colorful mountains. Those were some of my favorite memories from my early childhood.

As soon as the clock struck 11:45, I anxiously awaited my teachers’ approval to unlock the shackles keeping us in that confined classroom. And like the start of a horse race, we ran like bullets to play our favorite game; manhunt. In case you weren’t aware, manhunt is like the next level of hide and seek. There’d be two teams; one would have a given amount of time to find a good place to hide and secure their location, while the other team would count down until the time was right for them to hunt the hiders down. The goal was for the hiders to make it back to home base without getting caught. We bet our Halloween candy from the other night on the winners’ bowl. Today, I made sure to be a runner; I knew the perfect place to hide, after all.

3…2…1…GO!!!! Before I knew it, I was bolting through the battlefield. I ducked under swings, and flew past teachers as I made my way to the edge of the human child-pigpen I was fenced in. But, this particular fence had a secret. A hole: one big enough for a tiny kid like me to crawl through. No one would even think to look for me out in the trees behind the school, and when the time was right; BAM, I’d be back at home base before anyone would be able to realize they hadn’t found me yet. I’d just sneak into autumn’s natural hiding spot, the leaf piles. I could already taste the sweets and sours of the winning candy in my watering mouth.

I checked my left and right to see if anyone followed me, but I was in the clear. I dirtied up my white shirt and blue shorts as I dug my way out, like one of those army men training in the movies. Making it to the other side, I picked myself up and looked around for the perfect pile of leaves to disguise myself in. And there they were, right under a larger-than-life oak tree, one of the grandest heaps of leaves I had ever seen. I couldn’t help but giddily smile as I sunk my way deep into the brush of fall crinkly fall colors. I did so quietly, as to make sure I wouldn’t be alerting the seekers of my where-a-bouts if I crunched too much as I snuggled myself inside the cocoon.

And there I lay. Still smiling, I put my hands over my mouth to hold back from giggling. I had the kind of overwhelming joy a kid gets the first time the tooth fairy visits them, or meeting Goofy at Disney World. I was ecstatic. This feeling soon turned to disgust as I started noticing my surroundings. It smelt atrocious… and I could only imagine hundreds of bugs both living and dead inside this home I’ve made for myself. I wasn’t too scared of bugs, in fact, I loved digging in dirt and picking up wriggling worms. But for some reason, I felt utterly disgusted being in there. It felt moist and sticky and intoxicatingly gross. My eyes started itching… no burning, as I viciously rubbed at them in a fruitless attempt at making the pain go away. The scent seemed to make it’s way into my lungs and started relentlessly stabbing at them. I couldn’t take it anymore; I squirmed around in the nest in an attempt to find my way out, but I could barely see through my fort, as shades of red and brown blinded my vision. I didn’t know whether my eyes were bleeding or if it was just the color of the leaves rubbing against my face, but what I did know is that I wanted out of there, and I wanted it fast. Wiping my eyes against my leaf-stained shirt, my vision finally started beginning to clear. And that’s when I saw them.

Through the tiny slides between her limp eyelids laid two soft hazel pupils. Beneath those, her little nose had dry snot near the openings and I couldn't help but notice that she was in desperate need of some lip balm. It took me a second, but I finally recognized my fellow hider as a girl named Laurel. She was in my class the year prior, but I never really got to know her as she was always by herself. I do recall many of the kids thinking her to be weird, as she mostly spoke to her “imaginary friend.” But that didn’t bother her… She’d often scoff back at those judging her by telling them that her friend had promised her that one day they’d take her wherever she dreamed of going and that we’d all be jealous in turn. Needless to say, none of us were envious.

“Hey Laurel, what are you doing in here?” I whispered to her. She just kept staring at me, but never gave me a response. “Are you hiding in here from someone too?” She looked rather sickly, probably due to eating way too much candy last night. “Um… come on, let’s get out of here.” I reached within the swarm of leaves for her hand and finally got a hold of it. It was tiny and gentle, yet chilly and, once again, sticky. Too many lollipops, I assured myself. I finally made my way into the refreshing sunlight and took in an enormous breath of autumn air. I was still holding Laurel’s hand, but something didn’t feel quite right. She was a small girl, but at this moment she felt almost weightless. When I looked back I noticed she wasn’t fully out of the pile yet. Only her hand has breached the forest of leaves. It was coated in some sort of red sap. And so I tugged once more and this time her arm made its way out… only her arm.

Before I could even let out a yelp, a large hand wrapped around my mouth. It was rough. It felt like the ridges on its fingers were cutting my face with each slight movement. The hand was white and pale, but was covered in filth that contrasted the almost plastic look of the skin. He didn’t have to turn around for me to know who he was. It might’ve been a couple years, but somehow I still knew it was him. The man who wallowed by the windows of that abandoned home as Tim disappeared into the thin water; the scraggly man.

“Shhhh… It’s all right…” His whispering voice was soft… sinister. It felt as though his words had penetrated my ears and burrowed their way into my brain. My breathing became increasingly heavy and he could tell. “Your friend and I were having a playdate, but you can’t tell anyone. It’s our little secret.” I finally managed to free my mouth from his grasp and let out a shriek of pure terror. I heard someone in the distance question the source of the sound. I knew they were coming to look, and he knew it too. “I have to go now,” he told me, “but you have to promise me that you won’t tell anyone about me. Not your mom, not your dad, not anyone. And if you do,” his final words seemed to linger for what felt like hours, “I’ll know.” And with that I heard his footsteps walk away, crunching through the leaves, as he made his way back into the shelter of the trees. But he wasn’t even running. His motions were so innocent, and even when a teacher and a couple of other kids found me, I knew he was still there. Still watching. Eyes wide open.I then became distracted by the blood curdling howl a teacher let loose upon my ears, followed by one of my classmates upchucking their lunch from the sight no one should go through the suffering to witness.

Sirens and yelling from parents and cops flooded the schoolyard. Kids wondered what was going on as their moms and dads desperately picked them up. But the ones that were crying… they knew what happened.Soon enough I was being swarmed by officers. They were all talking incoherently, but I’ll never forget the one thing I did manage to make out. I clearly recall one of the officers blurting out, “isn’t this the same kid who was the last to see that missing boy a couple of years back?” I’m not sure what it was about that comment, but my heart sank. “Yes, yes it was.” I could’ve sworn I had only thought that, but suddenly everyone looked down at me in sheer silence. Their eyes were bugging out of their sockets, as if I had just said some taboo curse. Luckily for me, my parents had just arrived to break me free of their critical gazes.I wasn’t able to spend long within the comforting grasps of my parents arms, as a burly police officer with a mustache too big for his lip approached me; the sheriff. And once again, just as he did two years prior, he crouched down to my level and placed a caring hand on my shoulder… “Let’s talk, son.” But I wouldn’t be talking to him that day. I wouldn’t be talking to anyone. There was nothing for me to say. And He made sure of that…

Every night I looked out my window, I saw him. His ghost-white skin haunted the darkness itself, as he stood on the other end of the sidewalk. Most of the time he’d just be standing there, staring at my window. If we made eye contact, he would occasionally wave and sometimes put his index finger against his where his mouth should’ve been. I could never make out any facial features on him. It was as if his face was shrouded in a mist of ambiguity. So every night I’d turn the other way to face the never-ending hallway outside of my room. The one lamp my mom made sure to always keep on out there showed his shadow dominating the wall. If I stared too long, his shadowed head would cock sideways like a dog hearing an unfamiliar noise. He was always there watching over me, like a demented guardian angel.

And that’s how my life went from then on out. Our dreadful nightly routine became the norm for quite some time. That is, until the next incident…
