“Hey, Gabs. Have you seen Nuro? He didn’t show.”

“Oh, I thought he was supposed to be with Terryl today.”

“Terryl didn’t see him either.”

We approach Nuro’s house.

The color around his home is muted.

I bang on his door. “Nuro?” My voice doesn’t carry.

The knocks sound flat and lifeless, despite how hard I hit the wood.

My feet feel like bricks. Every movement is sluggish.

I reach for the door and hesitate before turning the handle.

My heart thumps in my chest as I inch the door open.

An acrid smell wafts through the air, almost imperceptible.

“Gabs, find Orzik. We shouldn’t go inside. At least not yet.”

I shut the door and slump to the ground.

I don’t want to stay, but I don’t want anyone to go inside.

I thought he was doing just fine.

I shake my head and sigh.

Someone touches my shoulder.

“...pened? Les?”

Sound erupts in my ears.

“Les?”

I can see again.

“Are you alright? What’s going on?”

It’s like everything snaps back into place.

I scramble to my feet. “Orzik?”

“Les, you’re outside of Nuro’s house.”

“Nuro!”

His kind green eyes flood my memory.

I need to protect what’s left of him.

“Les. Come away from the door.”

Orzik, always too gentle in moments like this, tries to guide me away.

“Gabs, can you bring him to the infirmary?”

“I can help, Orzik.”

“Not stumbling around like that.”

“He was supposed to be okay.”

“I know, Les. I know. You know it can be unpredictable.”

“Please let me do something.”

“Okay, barricade the house. Start where the plants browned. We don’t want to lose you again. Or anyone else.”

A line of dead ants leads into his house.

Gabs hands each of us cloaks embedded with protective sigils.

“I have enough food and water for a couple of days.” Tarryl’s voice is steady, but he’s not meeting my eyes.

“He might not remember us.”

“But we’ll remember him.”

I steel myself before stepping over the ants.

The air is thick with sour-tasting mold.

Orzik’s mouth moves, but no sound escapes.

My eyes widen as I put a finger on my lips.

Dead silence. The house has deafened us.

Once we’re in, the door slams and vibrates the floor.

Orzik gestures for us to continue.

Opened books encircle a scorched chasm.

It gives the impression of sound emanating from it.

A slight thumping breathes out of the area.

It’s rhythmic.

Like a heartbeat.

My eyes skip over the claw marks surrounding the hole.

Claw marks?

It’s like they wanted to close the abyss.

Nuro’s distorted face mouths the word “No!” then vanishes.

A loud, high-pitched screech reverberates through the air.

We all fumble around as sound dances back into our senses.

Embers fly out of the hole, exploding with static around the room.

“What the Marnells was that?”

The door to his kitchen slowly creaks open with an audible sigh.

“It feels like we shouldn’t go this way.”

I say, heading towards it.

“Les, remember that Tarryl’s brother died like this.”

“I have to find him, Gabs.”

“He screamed ‘No’ at us!”

“He’s trying to save us!”

“We need to make a decision.”

The door fades into shadow.

“The hole or the kitchen.”

“That isn’t his kitchen.”

“They’re both disappearing!”

I run through the kitchen door.

We find ourselves in his study.

The foyer is gone.

A handwritten note waits on the desk.

It reads:

“Lessie, thank you for coming, but it wants us to stay apart. Look for what’s wrong, and you’ll find what’s not. -Nurdy”

The note embeds itself into my arm, bleeding ink.

The essence of Nuro flickers into the seat of the desk.

He’s crying while writing the note.

“I think he was just here.”

“What’s different about his study?”

We survey the room.

There are no windows or doors.

Ozrik mimes opening a window.

“I swear I gra-” He blinks out of existence.

“Ozrik!”

The doors and windows are back.

The smell of his cologne lingers where he stood.

Tarryl mimics trying to open a window.

A beam of light slashes through Tarryl’s outstretched hand.

He screams as blood spurts from his pinkieless appendage.

Tarryl instinctively grabs for the chair and disappears.

The chair reappears with a flash.

“Find what’s wrong,” Gabs whispers.

She vanishes, leaving me alone.

I open and close my mouth, searching the room.

Replaying in my head over and over.

“What’s different? What’s different?”

It all looks the same to me.

“There’s nothing wrong here!” I cry.

I slam my arms onto the desk.

“It all looks the same.”

I tilt my head up, nearly defeated.

I heave a deep sigh and close my eyes.

“Stop panicking, you Mezzle.”

I stand in the middle of the room.

His giant map is gone.

I stare at the empty wall and pretend to throw a dart.

I blink, and suddenly, I’m in a new area.

“Les?”

“Tarryl?”

I hear his voice but don’t see him.

“We’re all here.”

“Where is here?”

She just laughs.

The ink is nearly gone from my arm.

Something tickles my ankle.

“Gah!”

I yank my foot up.

“Yeah, something keeps touching us.”

“It tickled me!”

Ozrik laughs with a deep, resonating chuckle.

“It all becomes clearer when you laugh.”

“Can’t be a fake one either.”

“What happens if you fake laugh?”

“Try it out.”

I open my mouth and hesitate.

“Almost got him.” Sighs Tarryl.

“He could have been here forever,” says Ozrik.

Gabs laughs, “What are you going to do now?”

I accidentally let out a nervous laugh.

I appear in another room.

“Oh! You made it out!”

Gabs pops into view.

“What the hell was that?” I stammer.

“I stopped asking that question after seeing the hole in the floor.”

“Where are Ozrik and Tarryl?”

“I’ve been in here by myself for a while.”

“But you popped in after I got here!”

“No, you showed up while I was trying to figure out this room.”

“This house is ridiculous.” I angrily snicker.

Gabs shifts into Ozrik.

“Whoops, that didn’t last long.” It says in Tarryl’s voice.

I shake my head, confused. “Wha?”

“Oh, did I get the voice wrong?” He says in my voice.

“This is weird,” I giggle.

“You’re too happy.”

The room melts away, and I see all three of them.

“...Hello?”

They turn towards my voice.

“Les!”

I hesitantly approach them.

“What’s wrong?”

“Do these cloaks break illusions?”

“Yes, they do.”

A long, thin, flesh colored segmented appendage slowly reaches out from behind her head.

“They break your illusion of safety,” she smiles.

They look like themselves but feel like voids.

They feel like space without stars.

Like black, but colored and empty, in the shape of my friends.

Nuro’s voice, “My life is unraveling. You shouldn’t have come.”

“But we’re you’re friends. Why wouldn’t we?”

“You’ve progressed further than I expected.”

“It’s what we do, you Mezzle-face,” I say, sticking my tongue out.

“I’ll give them back, but deeper you must go if you want to leave.”

“We only want to find you.”

The presence of his voice disappears.

Nothing changes from my friends, but the voidness is gone. And so is the appendage.

They slump to the ground, unconscious.

The burning hole appears next to us, along with the books and claw marks.

I swallow and wait for them to awaken.

Tarryl wakes up with a start.

“Les! What was the name of my dog as a kid?”

\-drip- -drip-

I sigh, “Facey. Yeah, it’s me, Tarryl. This damn house is finally giving us a break.”

He looks around at the other two.

Gabs is breathing heavily, and Ozrik is moving in his sleep.

Tarryl attempts to wake Gabs.

\-drip- -drip- -drip-

“I tried that with you guys already. We just have to wait.”

“The hole!”

“Yeah, I think that’s where we go next.”

He stares at the chasm.

“What’s dripping?”

He looks up, and his mouth opens slightly; simultaneously, his eyes widen in concern.

“Don’t look up!” He screams in a whisper.

He breathes hard and moves closer to Gabs and Ozrik.

“Grab Ozrik.” He sternly says, grabbing onto Gabs.

He heaves out a deep breath. “Let’s jump in.”

I hold Ozrik close to my body and take a leap.

“What the hell?”

“We’re running.”

It feels like we’re falling up but going down.

It’s almost like we fell into a hole within the hole.

The shape of it isn’t hole-like.

Tarryl whispers, “I think we jumped into the thing I saw.”

The shape looms inside my head.

I can feel it gnawing at my consciousness.

It wants me to fall asleep.

I don’t know how I know that.

It’s like the memory of what it wants inserted itself into my past.

Gabs yawns, and the rest of us follow suit.

I stretch my arms, letting go of Ozrik.

My eyelids flutter and struggle to stay open.

“We’re not falling anymore.”

“Why do you care so much?”

Tarryl is running sideways, but in the same direction we’re moving.

“Why don’t we just leave Nuro here?”

“It’s not like he wants us to find him.”

Gabs laughs and lays on her arms, snoring.

“The air tastes like soup.”

“I thought it smelled like my dog’s toenails.”

Gabs starts spinning wildly.

“Oh, she might hit something.”

“She should be alright, though.”

“I wonder if she’ll splat on the ground.”

Her body lies still on the floor.

“Oh, she did.”

“That’s too bad. I liked her as a person.”

“Yeah, I did as well. Oh, well.”

“Let’s go that way!” Tarryl happily points.

A red puddle enlarges and spreads around her head.

She’s still breathing.

“She can sleep it off.”

We saunter off in the direction Tarryl pointed.

Ozrik skips with a happy little tune.

“Oh, hi Nuro,” I smile, hugging him.

“Where’s Gabs?”

“Who is that?”

“The fuck do you mean, who’s that?” He exclaims.

“Oh, do you mean the woman from earlier?" I tilt my head. "She’s probably dead now.”

His face contorts in anger, then evolves into concern.

“Where?”

He runs in the direction we just came from.

“It’s too late, Nuro,” I yell after him.

There’s a wracking sob in the distance, “Gabriela!”

He lets out a devastated scream, “No. No. No. No. No.”

“What did she mean to you, anyways?” asks Ozrik.

Nuro is rocking her in a bloody embrace, kissing her temple.

There’s a pregnant pause.

“...Gabs?” Tarryl questions. His mouth slides open, his eyes looking distant.

We appear next to the line of ants.

Her memories invade my head as I slump.

A message appears on the door.

“Thank you for your offering.”

Tarryl whispers, “She was laughing...”

Ozrik and I just watch Nuro holding onto Gabs.

He rocks gently, back and forth.

The sigils on her cloak lift off the fabric, disappearing into the air.

“We got you back, Nuro,” I say flatly.

A tear rolls down my cheek.

I whisper, “We got you back.”
