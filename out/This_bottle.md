I bought a small glass bottle of cider four days ago. I sip it, and it never gets less in volume than half-way up the bottle. I can drink from this bottle as much as I want, but I don't get drunk. Instead, I get drowsy and I fall asleep. What happens next has left me feeling utterly confused about life and the nature of the universe. I fall asleep, or rather, I *phase out* and then when that discomfort has passed, I find myself in a new world, a new reality. I have a family there. I have a wife and two kids, and all the memories you would expect to come with that, and I love them.

I can even remember falling off my trike aged 5 in this other dimension, starting my first day of high school and getting a job. I can remember being a teenager and staring at and hating my reflection in the mirror and looking at my red hair and freckles and glasses and hating it all.

And then, when it's time for bed, I fall asleep, and I wake up back here by myself in my apartment and my dog for company. I'm successful in that other life too, but the details of how and why are vague because when I come back around to here the memories start fading like it was all a dream. But it isn't a dream. I check my hands, I check every crack and crevice on the walls till I'm saying out loud, this is real, this is real.

And now the liquid in the bottle is running out, the magic that kept it half- full is leaving and I want to go back to my real life, my good life, and I just want to stay there forever.

There's something else troubling me. My wife started getting unstamped letters pushed through the mail box addressed to her. The message in these letters are made of cut out pieces of newspaper and magazine print. They're saying they love her, they always watched her from afar, but they get the feeling her husband won't be around much longer to interfere.

I'm trapped in a parallel universe, maybe for good soon. Maybe if I just don't sleep...

The thing is, time stretches there, so what would've been a day is more like a few weeks. And the sun is always shining, and everything is almost shining. I don't think I'm gonna get to stay. But what if these notes coming through the letter box have something to do with this phenomena ? I once read that when something gets out of place the matrix turns on you, tries to extinguish that oddity, that part that went wrong in reality.

Maybe if I can just fight sleep when I get back there for as long as I can and for as long as it takes me to track down the letter writer. At least then maybe I can make some kind of sense out of all of this.

The bottle is sitting on my refrigerator shelf. I'm afraid to waste it. I miss my family. I dream about them, but it isn't the same. My greatest fear is one day believing it was all a dream.

It's just f\*kn crazy, aint it ?

At least my dog's in both places
