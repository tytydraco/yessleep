I know how this will sound.
And I know exactly what they’ll say about me.

That I was unstable. That the pressure got to me. That I was showing signs of paranoia and professional fatigue—maybe even some mild psychosis, if they really want to push it.

That’s how it always starts, when someone speaks up.
They don’t refute the claims.
They discredit the person.

I’ve seen it in internal memos. I’ve helped write the language.
“Unverified.” “Emotionally compromised.” “Acted outside procedural scope.”

And now they’ll say it about me.

But this isn’t about paranoia. Or stress. Or burnout.
This is about something real.
And what we allowed it to become.

I was brought into Operation VEILBURN in 1981. Officially, RADAR-32 was listed as a long-range signal testing site tucked between a few old government buildings. The public explanation was dull by design—signal calibration, weather monitoring, waveform analysis. Nothing high-profile. Nothing with teeth.

At first, that’s exactly what it was.

We logged pressure changes. Tracked signal drift. Flagged interference that usually turned out to be a loose cable or leftover Cold War debris bouncing through the upper atmosphere.

It was quiet. Uneventful.

Until it wasn’t.

The first incident happened in April of ’82. It didn’t come with alarms or alerts. One moment the camera feed from Loading Bay 4 was clear. The next, it was completely filled with dense, unmoving fog.

No motion. No entry logs. No temperature drop. Just fog.

White. Heavy. Pressed up against the lens like it was trying to see in.

They shut down the corridor for “maintenance.” Two weeks. Nobody talked about it. When it reopened, everything had been replaced. New paint. New floor plates. Even the ID scanner was gone. The security logs? Wiped. So was the footage.

I asked about it once. My supervisor smiled and said it was just a decon drill.
But afterward, that hallway felt wrong. Like the walls were holding their breath.

I let it go. For a while.

Then a month later, someone disappeared.

His name was Fletcher. Electrical subtech. Clocked in for his morning shift. Never clocked out. His car stayed in the lot for three days before it vanished, same as him.

No statement. No internal memo. No police report.

Just a new face at his workstation the following Monday and a one-line entry in the logs:
“Personnel reassigned. No action required.”

When I brought it up, my supervisor slid a calibration file across the desk—an assignment for a hallway I didn’t even know existed.

When I told him that, he said, “You do now.”

That’s when I realized the facility went deeper than we were told.

And not just in terms of security clearance.

Literally deeper.


They called a closed-door meeting in ’84. Only a few of us were invited. The room didn’t have a number. The invitation wasn’t in writing.

The briefing was verbal. No recording. No handouts.

They told us about decay zones.

Places in the atmosphere where electromagnetic behavior stopped following known patterns. Zones where frequencies warped without interference. Where static fields formed in empty air. Where there was nothing—and yet something always was.

That was the first time they admitted it.

VEILBURN wasn’t designed to study storms.

It was built to monitor breaches.

I didn’t ask what they meant.
Not then.


Later that week, we were shown footage of a controlled test.

A subject was sent into one of the sealed corridors—one that had recently been exposed to the fog.

The subject walked twenty feet in. Paused.
Turned to face the camera.
Smiled.

Then the feed cut to static.

That wasn’t what stayed with me.

It was the audio recording that followed.

A technician’s voice—barely audible, like he forgot his mic was still on:

“He was already in there. I swear to God, he was already in there.”

That clip was erased from the official archive.
But I heard it.

We all did.


No one said a word after that meeting. Not in the hallway. Not in the elevator. We just left, one at a time, like we were walking out of a funeral for someone whose name we didn’t know.

That was when I started to feel it.

Not fear—not exactly.
Something smaller. Quieter.
Like something had been opened.

And I didn’t realize it yet, but it was already following me.



A week later, I stayed late reviewing airflow data from the lower levels. Everyone else had cleared out. You don’t notice how loud buildings are until the people leave—fluorescent buzz, cooling fans, power regulators cycling in the walls.

That night, even those sounds were gone.

The silence was too perfect.

Around 2:00 a.m., I thought I saw fog forming at the end of Hall C. Not all at once—this time, it thickened gradually, as if bleeding out from the shadows beneath the emergency exit light.

It didn’t move. It didn’t roll.
It just thickened. Slowly. Deliberately.

I stood there, watching, barely breathing.

It never got close.

But I swear to God, it knew I was looking.

When I blinked, it was gone.

No trace. No sensor alert. No disruption in the airflow. Not even a visual anomaly in the camera logs.

But I stopped using that hallway after that.
For weeks, I took the long way.
I didn’t tell anyone why.


Then the humming started.

Low-frequency. Not exactly audible—more like pressure behind the ears. It would hit out of nowhere—mid-conversation, mid-keystroke—and disappear just as fast.

I asked around. Most people said they didn’t hear anything.
A few paused too long before answering.

One night, I felt it stronger than usual near Corridor 6B. I stopped walking and pressed my hand to the wall.

It was warm.

That corridor was underground, lined with sealed brick and steel-reinforced bulkheads. No heating vents. No systems nearby. It shouldn’t have been warm.

But it was.

After that, I started noticing other things.

Little things.

Reflections that didn’t line up.

Motion sensors triggering in empty rooms.

My workstation computer turning itself on before I arrived, despite being shut down the night before.

The third night, it flickered. Shut off. Then the monitor glowed to life.

Static.

And just for a moment, in the glass reflection, I saw someone—something—standing behind me.

Not moving. Just watching.

I turned around.

The room was empty.

The fourth night, I unplugged the computer entirely.

It still turned on.

That was when I stopped staying late.
Stopped going in early.
But it didn’t matter.

The feeling followed me home.
Or maybe it was never in the building to begin with.

By then, we weren’t receiving updates anymore, just directives.

New containment corridors were being built.
Wings were rerouted.
Names began disappearing from the employee logs without explanation.

They didn’t even try to hide it.

One week, the fog appeared in three separate corridors.

It wasn’t drifting.

It was tracking.

And the more time we spent near it, the more I realized something horrible.

We weren’t observing the fog.

It was observing us.
