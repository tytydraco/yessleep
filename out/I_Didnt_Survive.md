The world exploded in a shower of glass and screaming metal. One moment, I was driving, the wipers fighting a losing battle against the torrential rain blurring the already indistinct highway markers. The next, there was a deafening roar, a bone-jarring impact that stole the breath from my lungs, and then… silence. An unnerving, absolute silence that should have been filled with the shriek of tearing metal, the shattering of glass, the pained cries of the injured. But there was nothing. Only a suffocating stillness, broken only by the rhythmic thump of my own pulse, a frantic drum against the sudden, unsettling quiet.

My head throbbed, a dull ache that pulsed in time with the frantic beating of my heart. I tried to move, to assess the damage, but my limbs felt heavy, unresponsive. Slowly, tentatively, I opened my eyes. The interior of the car was a mangled mess. Twisted metal clawed at the darkness, shards of glass glittered like malevolent stars scattered across the crushed dashboard. Rain poured in through gaping holes in the roof, slicking the already sodden fabric of my seat. The air smelled metallic, acrid, like blood and burning rubber.

Yet, I felt… nothing. No searing pain, no broken bones, not even a scratch. It was utterly surreal. I should be bleeding, screaming, possibly unconscious. Instead, I was remarkably intact, sitting amidst the wreckage of a catastrophic accident, experiencing only a dull throbbing in my head and a rising tide of disorientation. The silence was the most unsettling aspect; the absence of sound was more terrifying than any scream. It was a silence that pressed in, suffocating, amplifying the disquiet. It was as if the very fabric of reality had been ripped apart and then hastily stitched back together, leaving this grotesque, silent void in its wake.

I pushed against the wreckage, forcing myself to sit up. My body ached, but the pain was negligible, a dull pressure that didn't match the severity of the crash. I looked around. The highway stretched before me, a dark, rain-slicked ribbon winding into the night. There were no lights, no other cars, just the relentless downpour and the crushing weight of the silence. I was utterly alone. Isolated in the heart of this metal tomb, surrounded by the wreckage of what should have been a fatal accident. A terrifying, perfect solitude.

Fear, cold and sharp, began to claw its way into my consciousness. This wasn't right. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Accidents like this resulted in casualties, injuries, chaos, and noise. Yet here I was, miraculously unharmed, adrift in a sea of silent destruction. The incongruity of it all was deeply unsettling, the dissonance between the catastrophic reality of the mangled car and my own unscathed body a gaping chasm that threatened to swallow me whole. A feeling of unreality, of profound wrongness, settled over me like a shroud.

The rain continued to fall, washing over the wreckage, blurring the already indistinct shapes around me. I tried to focus on the details, to ground myself in the reality of the situation. But the silence persisted, a constant, ominous presence that heightened the sense of unreality. It was like a suffocating blanket, muffling everything, even my own thoughts. The world felt strangely muted, as if I were watching a scene unfold from behind a thick sheet of glass. Or perhaps, I was already behind that glass, separated from the world by a silent, impenetrable barrier.

I eventually managed to clamber out of the crushed vehicle, the metal groaning in protest under my touch. The rain continued its relentless assault, plastering my clothes to my body, soaking me to the bone. The ground beneath my feet was a mixture of mud and broken glass. Each step I took sent a shiver down my spine, a visceral reminder of the horrific event that should have left me shattered, yet here I was, eerily intact.

As I stumbled away from the wreckage, I caught a glimpse of myself in the reflection of a shattered car window. My face was pale, drawn, etched with the shock of the near-death experience. But there were no cuts, no bruises, no blood. Not even a single scratch. My skin was flawlessly smooth, unblemished, a stark contrast to the brutal reality of the scene surrounding me. The realization slammed into me with the force of a physical blow. Something was deeply, horribly wrong. More than wrong; impossible. This wasn't just an accident. It was something else, something far more sinister, something beyond comprehension. The implications hung in the air, heavy and suffocating, and my heart began to pound in my chest once more, this time not with the shock of the impact, but with a terrifying sense of impending doom. The silence remained, a constant, chilling companion, a stark testament to the unsettling and impossible nature of my survival. The rain continued to fall, a bleak and unforgiving curtain drawn over the unfolding horror.

The rain had stopped, leaving behind a world washed clean, sterile almost, a stark contrast to the chaos I had just escaped. The silence, however, remained, a heavy, oppressive blanket stifling any lingering hope of normalcy. I ran a hand over my cheek, expecting the rough scrape of gravel against my skin, the sting of a fresh wound. My fingers encountered only smooth, flawless skin. The memory of the searing pain, the impact, the feeling of being crushed, all impossibly vivid, were juxtaposed against the cold, unblemished reality of my own body. Where were the abrasions, the cuts, the bruises that should have been decorating my skin like grotesque tattoos? There were none. My skin was flawless, an unsettling testament to something beyond explanation.

Panic, raw and visceral, threatened to overwhelm me. I examined my arms, my legs, every inch of my body, searching for some physical sign, some evidence to confirm the horrific reality of the accident. But my skin remained strangely pristine, untouched by the carnage I had just survived. It was as if the accident had happened to someone else, a spectral twin, leaving me untouched, an anomaly. A ghost in my own life. The thought twisted in my gut, icy and sharp, a constant reminder of the impossible truth.

The rational part of my brain screamed for an explanation. Maybe it was shock. Maybe the rain had washed away any superficial injuries. Maybe… maybe I was hallucinating. But the mangled wreckage of the car, the persistent silence, the chilling absence of any physical trauma, all these facts contradicted the possibility of hallucination. This wasn’t a dream; this was an impossible reality, a nightmarish paradox that defied all logic. And the silence, oh, the silence! It was the most terrifying aspect, a constant, chilling presence that amplified every unsettling detail.

The rising sun cast a pale, weak light on the scene, revealing the full extent of the devastation. The car was a twisted, mangled mess, a monument to destruction. Yet I stood beside it, unscathed, a living paradox in a world that didn’t seem to acknowledge my existence. It was like a cruel joke, a dark comedy played out in the silent aftermath of a catastrophic event. The impossible silence gnawed at my sanity, a constant reminder of my improbable survival.

I stumbled towards the nearest road, hoping to find help, to have someone confirm the reality of my situation, or perhaps to help me understand its absurdity. The road was deserted, the emptiness mirrored by the desolate landscape. The world was mute, watching me with a silent, unnerving gaze.

Hours have passed and there was still nothing, or so I thought. As I walked towards town I could have sworn that I was seeing someone following me, someone that was just always out of my eyes, even outside of my peripherals. “Show yourself!”  I began yelling out, but it seems that maybe I jumped the gun. I continued on my long journey back home still without passing a single soul. 

I finally made it back home, but things seemed wrong. I saw my wife and she was crying, she was sitting down on the couch wiping tears as she was on the phone and without a moment of hesitation she took off in a hurry. I could not figure out why though, but there was no use following her on foot so I just waited. I waited and waited for hours watching television and browsing the web until the door opened and my wife came in but someone was behind her wrapped up with bandages. I was staring until I finally realized who it was behind my wife. I was looking at me. 

I don’t even know how this is possible, but seeing my own face made me feel light-headed. A wave of nausea hit me so hard I had to grip the wall before my legs gave out. My vision blurred as I steadied myself, but my eyes stayed locked on the scene unfolding before me. My wife guided me, or whatever it was, into our bedroom, gently laying him down. She stayed by his side for a while, smoothing the sheets, brushing the hair from my forehead, whispering things only meant for me. Then she left.

That’s when he turned his head. For the first time since the accident, he looked directly at me. My breath hitched as I saw my own reflection in his darkening eyes, no, not darkening, blackening, as if ink was bleeding through them, swallowing the whites whole.

“That sure was a close one,” I heard my own voice say, though it didn’t feel like mine. “This body was almost useless, but I’m glad it survived. Get comfortable, because unless you get as lucky as I did, you’re going to be stuck like that for a while.” What did he mean by that? What was even happening? My head pounded with questions, but I forced the words out. “What happened?” I wanted answers, but all I got in return was a laugh, my laugh, twisted into something cold and cruel. “I saw an opportunity, and I took it.”

That wasn’t an answer. Not really. But something told me I wasn’t going to get a better one. My frustration boiled over, my hands clenching into fists, my mind screaming at the impossibility of it all. I slammed my fist into the wall. The drywall cracked. I froze. I could affect my surroundings. Maybe I wasn’t some Casper doomed to haunt my own home. Maybe, just maybe, I still had a chance.

I followed him for weeks. I watched as he ate my food, used my computer, spent time with my wife. I watched as he walked into my job, smiled at my coworkers, laughed at their jokes. He slipped into my life with sickening ease, and no one, not a single person, questioned it. But something else was happening…

At first, it was just flickers at the edge of my vision, little blurs that vanished when I tried to focus on them. Then they became more defined. Shapes. Figures. Moving in the dark corners of rooms, just out of reach. I thought they were stalking me. But they weren’t. They were stalking him. Or rather, my body. They wanted what I wanted. What he wanted. They wanted inside my skin.

They didn’t seem aggressive, yet. They reminded me of scavengers circling a dying animal, waiting for their moment to strike. But then I looked at my hands. The fingers, the arms, they weren’t solid anymore. They were darkening, losing their form, the same inky black that filled his eyes creeping through me. I was turning into them. I didn’t know how long I had, but I knew this, I was running out of time. If I didn’t act now, I’d be lost forever. Just another shadow lurking at the edges, waiting for scraps. No. I would take my body back.

The plan was simple. I knew my schedule. I knew his schedule. I also knew that while the normal world couldn’t touch me, I could still affect it. The only exception was the thing wearing my body. And I knew one more thing. For something to take over a body, the occupant had to leave first. For me, that had been the accident. That meant there was only one way to force him out. I had to nearly take my own life.

If I failed, I’d become one of them. But even if there was only a 1% chance that I could reclaim what was mine… I had to try.

I slipped into the car, silent, unseen, and sat in the passenger seat. He drove onto the highway, the speedometer climbing. The city lights blurred past as I steadied my thoughts. I couldn’t screw this up. I wouldn’t screw this up. The bridge was coming up fast. I reached out. With everything I had, I grabbed the wheel and wrenched it sideways. Tires screeched. Horns blared. Impact. Metal crunched, glass shattered, and the world erupted into chaos. The car slammed into the ground below in a sickening cacophony of destruction. The smell of burning rubber and gasoline filled the air. My body, his body, slumped over in the driver’s seat, blood dripping from nearly every opening on his face. His ink-filled eyes fluttered open, then slowly slid shut. And then… Everything went black.

I am writing this because I don’t think anyone else has ever gone through this. No one else has returned to tell the tale. I didn’t make it. I failed.

As I type, the ink creeps higher, swallowing me inch by inch. Soon, I will lose all sense of self. I will become one of the others. A shadow. A scavenger. A nothing.

If anyone reads this, please…

Don’t forget me.
