It was a dark and stormy night, and Sarah was driving home from a party. She was tired and a little drunk, and she just wanted to get home and go to bed. But as she drove down the deserted road, she realized that she was lost.

Sarah pulled over to the side of the road and tried to use her phone, but she had no signal. She looked around, but there were no signs or landmarks to help her figure out where she was. She was completely alone in the dark, with nothing but the sound of the rain pounding against her car.

Suddenly, Sarah saw a figure in the distance. It was a man, standing in the middle of the road. Sarah honked her horn, but the man didn't move. She tried to drive around him, but he stepped in front of her car.

Sarah was terrified. She didn't know what to do. She tried to back up, but the man grabbed onto her car and wouldn't let go. She tried to push him off, but he was too strong.

Just when Sarah thought she was going to die, the man spoke. "I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't mean to scare you. I just needed a ride home."

Sarah was relieved. She rolled down her window and told the man to get in. He climbed into the passenger seat, and Sarah started to drive.

As they drove, the man told Sarah about his life. He was a soldier, he said, and he had just returned from a tour of duty. He was on his way home to see his wife and kids, but his car had broken down. He had been walking for hours in the rain, and he was exhausted.

Sarah listened to the man's story, and she started to feel sorry for him. She offered to let him stay at her house for the night, and he gratefully accepted.

When they arrived at Sarah's house, the man went inside and made himself comfortable. He thanked Sarah for her kindness and promised to repay her someday.

As Sarah went to bed that night, she felt good about herself. She had helped a stranger in need, and she had made a new friend. But as she lay in bed, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

She got up and went to the living room, where the man was sleeping on the couch. She looked at his face, and she realized that she recognized him. He wasn't a stranger at all. In fact, he was the man who had killed Sarah's sister in a hit-and-run accident years ago. Sarah had never been able to forgive him for what he had done, and she had spent years dreaming of revenge. But now, as she looked at him sleeping on her couch, she realized that she had the perfect opportunity to go through with it. She had finally found the closure she needed. Sarah went to the kitchen and grabbed a butchers knife and as she returned the man stirred groggily and asked Sarah what she was doing. Sarah knew this was her only chance and took her opportunity as she began to bludgeon the man on her living room couch saying that he would never be able to hurt anyone else’s again. Once Sarah had finished she texted the mans family and said… it is all over now I can’t live with the guilt of knowing that I took a life. I have decided to end it all. Sarah discarded of the body along with the phone in the woods. She went back to bed, and she slept soundly for the first time in years.
