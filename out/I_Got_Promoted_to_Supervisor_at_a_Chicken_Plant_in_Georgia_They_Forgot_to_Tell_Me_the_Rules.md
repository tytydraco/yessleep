Hey folks. Call me Edward. It's not my real name, but it's close enough. I don’t want this tied to my real name. *Especially* after what happened last week.  Expect names or places have obviously been altered as well. 

I started at Calloway Farms back in 2004, right after I got out of tech school. North Georgia- Hall County if you know the area. We did it all, from live bird receiving and slaughter, to marinating and shipping to retail and fast-food suppliers. Nasty work, but steady pay. You get used to the smell eventually, or at least you think you do. One thing you never really get used to, though, is the strange hum that vibrates through your bones any time you're near or in the plant.

After a couple years on the job, in early August 2006, they offered me a promotion: Maintenance Supervisor, Night Shift. I was ecstatic: I had been a dayshift lead in the evisceration department (Evis for short,) for seven months at this point, but I felt like my skills were wasted on sharpening knives and handing out PPE; and the pay raise I would be getting was unbelievable. I should’ve known something was off when the nightshift manager shook my hand and said, his typical southern drawl, “Once you see what we're doing down there, you’ll understand why we pay maintenance so much.”

---

At first, I thought he meant the rats. I had been told by the night shift crew about the rats that infested the wastewater channels below the plant; they'd creep into the picking room, (where feathers are removed from the dead chickens before they get to Evis,) on night shift, and drag away any unattended carcasses not cleaned up from production. Some said, if the lines weren't running, you could even hear them gnawing at the bones.

The first few nights were fine: lights buzzing, conveyor belts whining, obviously drowsy line workers cutting, rinsing, and bagging. My crew usually loitered around the maintenance shop waiting for a call. And by 3 AM we had gotten just that.

"Maintenance, Evis line 2 please, maintenance Evis line 2. A drain is overflowing." The crackle of the radio handset on my shoulder had snapped me out of a half-asleep stupor. "10-4 Evis line 2, I'm coming." Came the reply from Rodrigo, who was an older, slightly-shorter-than-average man from Guatemala, and also my lead technician. I had always thought he was *incredibly* agile for his age.

Rodrigo was a seasoned veteran of the maintenance department, and had been with the company for longer than I had been alive. Rumor at the time was that Rodrigo had been asked to step up into the position after the last supervisor retired, but had politely declined the offer, for personal reasons. I'll even admit, he would have been a better fit than me.

I decided to find Rodrigo and go check out what the issue was together; clogged drains were usually something mundane, like a whole chicken or an apron winding up in the drain when it shouldn't have, and usually didn't require a maintenance tech to fix.

---

I met Rodrigo in the hallway between maintenance and Evis. He was carrying two arms full of tools; a large crowbar, ratchet and socket set, lantern, and a long hook used for dislodging anything that makes it past the wall partition out of the drain.

"Need some help, man?" I asked, happy to have something to do. "Hey bossman, you headed to Evis too?" I nodded and grabbed the crowbar and ratchet set, then followed him through the large double doors into Evis.

Using the crowbar, Rodrigo opened up a small gate that diverted incoming water and viscera to a separate drain, so we would have a better view of whatever was clogging up this one. "I don't feel nothing in there boss, wanna take a look?" He said, offering me a mag-light. "No bud, I believe you." 
He had just spent about five minutes digging around in the drain with the hook. "Got anything longer? It might be further in." I asked, trying my best to be helpful. "Can't be, its a sheer drop after it goes past the wall. We're going to have to use the service ladder."

---

He turned on the lantern and led me through a locked door to a stairwell that I never knew existed; rusted iron steps going down past the foundation, where the walls turn from poured concrete into something more akin to a natural cavern. I could hear something dripping, but it was too thick to be water. It smelled like copper and rot down there.

"I've never been down here before, and I thought all the drains went to wastewater?" I questioned, a little puzzled at why we'd need these stairs. I could see the confusion and concern cross his face as he stared at me in the light of the lantern. "They do. All of them except for *this* one. I'm surprised they didn’t tell you bef- never mind. Probably just better to show you anyway." he said, a hint of something conspiratorial in his voice. "Show me... what?" I asked. 

For the first time in my two years at the plant, I had noticed something. Actually, the *absence* of something: that strange hum that seems to always be around the plant is gone here. Not quieter, not further away, *gone*. This disturbed me, even more so than the discovery of an entire subfloor I had never heard of. 

Rodrigo looked at me once we'd reached the bottom of the staircase, and whispered: "Stay quiet, and whatever you do, don't pray to your *God*. *He* won't hear you down here, but *it* will." I was not a religious man at the time, but even then, his words sent a chill through me.

---

There’s a chamber down there: huge, rounded, like a cistern. A loud, wet, crunching noise could be heard from the darkness below. At the top of the chamber, suspended by chains, a large metallic sphere hangs, its surface almost shimmering. Three thick black wires snake from the sphere and disappear into the darkness a few feet from the level where we stood. "Don't go into the circle made by the wires, and it can't touch you. Whatever you hear down there, pretend you didn't. Do not respond to it, not even in your head." Rodrigo said in a low, almost reverent voice. "The end of the drain is across the chamber, on the opposite side of us. We will walk around the perimeter of the room to reach it. The wires are bare, *do not* touch or step on them." Rodrigo flips a large lever and the chamber bursts into light.

---

I didn't see it at first. It wasn't a rat. It *definitely* wasn't a chicken, though it was surrounded by chicken carcasses in various states of decay, and mostly half-eaten. It didn't have fur, or feathers. It was slick, and a deep, oily black. When it stood up, wings akin to living shadow unfurled from its back. I could hear faint whispers, tugging at the edges of my mind from the moment I noticed it. 

When it inhaled, the whole room got colder, and when it breathed out, the temperature returned to the same muggy warmness as Evis, caused by the hot water that ran into the drains above us.

Then it spoke- not in words, but through vibration. The walls hummed, the air trembled, and I understood at once what it was telling- no, *demanding* of me. 

"*Free me, Edward.*"

The feeling of that creature's order swirling through my head made me instantly nauseous. I tried to remember what Rodrigo had warned me about. I tried to refuse:

"No... I-"

---

The next thing I remember was waking up to Rodrigo dragging me back up the stairs. I felt a hot, throbbing pain in my right hand. He slammed the door shut and locked it. “ARE YOU CRAZY?" he said. “THAT DAMNED THING ALMOST GOT LOOSE WHEN YOU SHORTED OUT THE WIRES!” I looked at my hand, and I couldn't believe what I was seeing: the three of my fingers were gone. No blood, just cauterized stumps in the place of my pointer, ring, and middle fingers.

---

The shift manager was standing over me, a terrified look on his face. "I'm sorry, son. This is my fault. I should have met with you on your first night and explained the... *rules* of working night shift maintenance with you. This one's on me, boy. Come with me to my office." He said solemnly.

---

By 8 AM, my manager had called in a team of clean-shaven men in black jumpsuits with strange,  triangular symbols on the left chest pocket. They carried tablets and what looked like metal detectors. One of them tapped the floor near the drain that was clogged  and said, “Inverse containment field still active.” in an accent foreign to me.

My manager told me shortly after to take the week off. Fully paid.


---

I tried to report it anonymously, but every email bounced back. I called the Inspector General of the USDA. I was told that the USDA inspector who came two days later to follow up didn’t even go near the drain, or the door. He just signed some paperwork and left without saying a word.

I returned to work the following Sunday night. My manager wanted to meet with me before my shift, so I reported directly to his office instead of doing my usual walkthrough of the machines. "Has anyone seen your hand, son?" He asked me.  "No sir, except for Rodrigo and the doctor. Doctor said it looks like it is an old wound though, wouldn't even prescribe an antibiotic." I replied. "Give me your hand, boy. Consider this one of the *benefits* of your new role." Confused, but interested in what he had just said, I offered my hand to him. 

Searing pain. I screamed. 

"Heh," my manager chuckled, "yeah, that's the usual response." "*You* listen here!" I said, pointing my finger at him.

 He smiled, and looked down at my hand. 

So did I. 

Where once there were three stubs, now extended three fully formed fingers. "How did you-" I started to say, but was cut off. "Perks of the job, my boy! Those sciency types from Sweden offer all kinds of goodies. All we have to do is keep *it* fed, and keep quiet about what we're doing here. Who cares if a few dozen chickens a night go missing. Heck, we don't even have to power that thing's cage! It actually provides most of the power the plant needs to run by itself! Ever notice we don't ever have power outages here?" He winked at the last word. "Now on to business, son. Those fine gentlemen in the jumpsuits you seen here last week. Tech..ny..lodians... I think they call themselves. They've been watching you since then. They told me you tried telling stuff that ain't meant to be known, but that's okay! They caught it before it got out. I explained to our friends that you're new, and don't know no better! They understood. This time." 

He said the last couple of words with a severity I was unaccustomed to, far removed from his usual bubbly southern charm. I was dumbfounded. This chicken plant has, for all I can tell, a literal *demon* trapped in the basement, feeding on excess chicken carcasses, and my boss is a miracle healer. "Now run along and keep those machines running. We are feeding *America*, son!"


---

I feel like it's been long enough now that those *Technologians*, as I've recently learned they're actually called, from Sweden probably aren't watching me anymore- at least not as closely. They still come around every few months, with their metal detector things and tablets.

I overheard part of one of their muffled conversations a few weeks back. "Kyrie Field resonance is stable. Risk of containment breach at .00013%"

Does anyone else work in the poultry industry in Georgia? I'd like to hear your stories if you do. Hell, if I don't get a bag thrown over my head and carted off to some CIA blacksite after posting this, I may even tell some more of my stories from the chicken plant. Working here does offer some *interesting* perks.

Best wishes: Edward, Shift Manager, Night Shift at Calloway Farms.
