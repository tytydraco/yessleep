*FRIDAY*

I tried to call in sick today, but no one answered the phone. Can't say I blame them. Oh well, my stab wound doesn't hurt *that* bad. And I would've had to come in to get my paycheck anyway. If you don't pick it up in person, they won't mail it out to you, they just consider it to be an 'offering' and keep it.

I don't even have to wonder what fresh hell I'll be walking into today. All the worst soul suckers come to shop on Friday; the regulars and the irregulars. And, I don't even have any backstock to keep me busy, since everything got filled yesterday. So, tonight I'll be stuck having to do one of the worst jobs in this store; customer service.

When I clock in, Crazy Mary is already approaching me, complaining that the chocolate ice cream she bought here the other day made her raccoon sick. I just hand her my pee cup and keep on walking. Today, I came prepared. 

Usually, the first wave of customers I encounter on Fridays are The Zombies. All of the old people in our town start wandering in here, eyes empty and glazed over, mouths gaping with drool spilling out, and they all desperately need something from you. Sometimes, they don't even come in here to buy anything, they just want to 'pick your brain'. 

Hoping to delay the inevitable, I head on to the back of the store to drop off my things in my locker, and put my dinner in the fridge. This time, I wrote 'TOM' in big, bold letters on the bag, so Lenny can't pretend he doesn't know it's mine. Not that it'll stop him from taking it, but it does eliminate his ability to use that excuse. 

On the way, I can already hear Space Goth before I see her. She isn't singing today; instead, she's wearing one of those belly dancer belts that jingle with every movement she makes. I guess that's what she was trying to warn us about on Monday. It's incredibly annoying, but at least now I can avoid her more easily. I don't feel like having an argument with her tonight over which conspiracy theories are real. Maybe if I'm lucky, The Zombies will be drawn to the sound and take whatever brains she has left. 

I get to the back, and the first thing I do is check the schedule to see who I'm closing with tonight, hoping it's not Paul. I'm pretty sure he's still mad at me for leaving him in the freezer so long yesterday. And besides, the bailer can't hold the amount of customers I'm expecting to come in tonight. When I look at Friday's column, I see a name I don't recognize. Great, looks like I'll be doing the second worst job in this store tonight, too. Training. 

We don't get a ton of new hires around here, and the ones we do get never stick around long. It's a total waste of my time to bother with training them, but I guess I don't have anything better to do tonight. In fact, this could actually turn out to be a good thing... Maybe I can use the new hire as a human shield against the customers. 

I start looking around for the newbie, and quickly clock someone who looks out of place. I walk up to him and introduce myself. He tells me it's his first day, and his name is Dennis. Seems like a normal enough kid, excited to be here and ready to learn. Let's see how long that lasts. 

The first thing I usually do with new hires is show them around the store. Most of the time, that instantly weeds out all the normal ones. Once they see what kind of shit they're going to be dealing with, they dip out. Not Dennis though. He seems to get more enthusiastic about working here with every new thing I show him. This one's spirit might take a while to break. 

Next, I show Dennis the warehouse, and start explaining how to do backstock. Even though there's nothing to fill tonight, I go through the motions of showing him where the carts are, and explaining how to get the products to stay on them. I demonstrate with a couple cases of potato chips, thinking the dude is going to freak out when he sees what happens. Nope. Dennis thinks it's fucking hilarious. He giggles with delight as he chases the pigeons around the warehouse. He didn't even care when one shit on him. What kind of psychopath did we just hire?

On the way out of the warehouse, The Fart Cloud hits both of us. Fucker doesn't even flinch. I'm choking, tears streaming down my face, and he's going on about how good whatever someone is cooking smells. The Fart Cloud is getting stronger too, I'm pretty sure it's been going around accumulating all the smells of this place. 

The Zombies are already at the door, waiting for us to come out. I grab Dennis and shove him out in front of me, plowing my way through them. A few toughs of his hair along with his left eyebrow  were missing once we got past them, but other than that he was fine. He said he'd been meaning to get a haircut anyway. 

At this point, it's really starting to piss me off that nothing seems to bother this kid. So, as soon as I see Blind Richard wandering around lost down aisle 4, I send Dennis over to him to help him out. The blind leading the blind. This ought to be fun. 

Just then, I notice Duffle Bag Man grabbing handfuls of whatever's in his bag, and sprinkling it all around in the corner over by the coolers. 

"Hey man, get the fuck out of here!" I yell at him. 

He scurries off and tells me I'll be sorry. Whatever.

I go to check on the registers up front. Seems to be going pretty smoothly; The Zombies have all gathered up there and are helping Tilly keep her register quite tidy. By the time I notice The Hum, it's almost 7:30. Guess I'd better go find Dennis and tell him it's time for break. 

When I find him, he's on aisle 13 with Blind Richard. They're making snow angels in The Spill That Never Dries. Of course. I throw a box of saltines at Blind Richard, then drag Dennis to the back to hose all the green slime off him. We have to keep The Spill isolated to aisle 13, or it'll end up taking over the whole damn store. 

When we finally get to the break room, Lenny isn't in there, but The Turd Slug is. And, by the smell, it seems the raw egg/yogurt soup it was eating yesterday didn't agree with its stomach. If you're wondering how a Turd Slug could smell any worse... don't. Just trust me. 

"Aww, look at the little fella! He's so cute!" Dennis exclaims, as he bends down to pet it. 

The Turd Slug starts purring, and Dennis asks if he lets us hold him. I tell him to go for it, as I throw my dinner into the trash and walk out. 

The last customers of the night are usually The Prairie People. We call them that because they show up here in a covered wagon, all dressed like it's 1864. They might actually be time travelers, who knows. The first one you see is the mom, but as soon as she starts asking you questions about the products, her daughters get curious too. One by one, they tear their way out of her stomach, until they're all lined up in front of you. Once they get all the information they need, they crawl back inside their mother, and leave without buying anything. Dennis tried to crawl inside her stomach hole too, but I stopped him. 

At last, time to clock out and go home. Dennis' information hasn't been entered into the system yet, because Ruby's the only one allowed to do it and she only comes to work when Gerold is here, but I'll show him how to clock out anyway. Before I punch my numbers in though, I grab my paycheck. It's missing at least 10 hours from it, so I make up the difference with some of the money out of Tilly's register. 

I go back over to the time clock, and Lenny is there, dripping all over it. I use the sleeve of my jacket to hit the numbers, but when I turn around, I slip on his puddle of goo. I go flying backwards, and my head slams into the time clock, clocking me back in. Dennis bursts into laughter and says,
