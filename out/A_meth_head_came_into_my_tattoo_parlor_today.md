A meth head came into my tattoo parlor today. She was dressed in a dirty white sports bra and denim shorts, giving everyone a good look at the hundreds of sores that covered nearly every inch of her pale skin.

  
“How can I help you, ma’am,” I asked.

  
She smiled. Her teeth (well the three that remained) were black and decaying. “I need a tattoo with my boyfriend’s name,” she said.

  
“What’s his name?”

  
“Brielyn.”

  
“His name’s Brielyn?” That sounded like a girl’s name. A trailer trash girl’s name to be precise, the kind who would have five kids by four different daddies by the time she was 20.

  
She nodded. “I want it on my forehead.”

  
“On your forehead? Are you sure?”

  
“I’m sure, I want everyone to see it and know how much he means to me. I want it in big letters.”

  
“OK,” I said. Some artists won’t do face tattoos, but I’d tattoo anything, as long as I got paid. Plus, I didn’t think this girl would be interviewing for jobs any time soon. “Is black ink fine?”

  
She nodded.

  
“That will be $200. You have the money?”

  
“I do indeed.” She handed me a hundred-dollar bill and two fifties. I checked to see were legit, and to my surprise they weren’t counterfeit.

  
I made a quick sketch and got to work. It wasn’t the easiest of jobs—she was jittery, plus she reeked—but I finished it in about an hour. I handed her a mirror and she smiled. “Now everyone will know how much he meant to me.”

  
After getting up from the chair, I heard her phone buzz. She pulled it out and started laughing. 

“Brielyn’s not my boyfriend anymore.”

  
“Well,” I said, unsure why she was laughing. “You can get it lasered off. Or I could try to turn it into something else.”

  
She grinned at me. “He’s dead.”

  
“What?”

  
“You heard me, he’s dead. I killed him. He was cheating on me with my sister, so I put a bit of poison in the Mountain Dew he drinks for breakfast. That was the hospital texting me, he just passed. You probably wondering why I got his name on my forehead. Well, I know that the scientists in their white coats will run these fancy tests and find out I killed them. Then I’ll go to jail and the first question everyone asks me is who is Brielyn. And I’ll tell them that he was my boyfriend but he wasn’t faithful so I killed him. And then I’ll tell them that if they don’t want their names tattooed on my flesh, they better not try anything with me.”

  
She started cackling. “They will know that I am one crazy bitch.”

  
It was my turn to laugh. “I hate to break the news to you, ma’am, but you are about 70 pounds soaking wet. If a mouse farted, I think it would be enough to blow you over. No one will be afraid of you. They will just think you are just another meth head.”

  
“You really think so?”

  
I nodded. “I’m afraid I do, ma’am.”

  
“Oh…” she said, looking sad, like a lost puppy dog. “Can I have a refund then?”

  
“No, ma’am. No refunds.”

  
“Damn.” She walked out the door. I thought I was done with her.  But five minutes later, she walked back in, a .45 ACP handgun in her hand.

  
“Are you scared of me now,” she asked.

  
I nodded. But it had nothing to do with her tattoo. I’d be scared of anyone with a gun. 

  
“Good,” she said. She raised the pistol, struggling to control the gun. 

  
“You can have a refund, ma’am.” I said, trying to remain calm. 

  
“I don’t want the money,” she said. “I want your life.” She pulled the trigger. 

  
The bullet went way to the left. However, the recoil, although relatively gentle, was enough to send the frail woman to the ground. As she fell she unleashed this high-pitched wail. There was a loud crack as she hit the concrete floor. 

  
By the time paramedics arrived, she was dead. They took her body out, but her ghost remains. Time will tell if she is scarier in death than in life. I highly doubt it.
