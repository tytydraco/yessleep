Hey Reddit, it’s Mark again. As you all know, I’m a big fan of urban exploration. I’ve started visiting old forums through internet archives and stuff. I found this weird SOS post from 2009 by someone with the username “DastardlyDan” on an old urban exploration forum. There were no responses. I just get a weird feeling reading this and had to share it with you all. This is the second part; the thread itself spans three days of posts, but I have to manually transcribe each one since the copy-and-paste doesn’t work. Anyway, enough about me. Here’s the second post. 



A quick note, by the way. I think I found the factory, or least found better directions elsewhere on the forum. I’m gonna try and explore it soon and get some photos. I’m not going in that basement though. 



***Second post in the thread: July 8th, 2009***



Hey everyone. So I started writing that post before Paul. I really need some help out here.



We couldn’t even grab his body. We didn’t want the same thing to happen to us. He’s still out there, just laying there. I’ve went out to check on him a couple times. It’s weird; it looked like he’s almost dissolving into the ground itself but there’s no bugs or anything. No smell either, except for burnt hair for some reason.



Jackson and I went back inside afterwards and decided to take turns exploring the office. One of us stayed on the work floor at all times so it didn’t change, but the office morphed every time one of us went in. The wallpaper would change, the layout would shift slightly, there’d be new paintings, and most importantly, documents. We figured if there was a way out it’d be in one of those documents in the office. 



I went in first. Jackson said he wanted to “review footage”. 



The office was back in order, but the wallpaper was still peeling. The eerie paintings from before were still on the wall, but with more details. The one with the shadow of the hanged man no longer just showed a shadow; you could see a crowd of four or five people walking away from the tree. The tree itself still didn’t depict anything, but I could have sworn that the shadow of the man was swinging. The party now depicted blood coming out of the eyes and mouth. As I stared at their faces, I remembered Paul. The condition of the partygoers and his body were pretty similar. 



Maybe that painting was supposed to be a warning somehow.



I tore my eyes from the paintings. The files were back in the cabinet, so I began walking over there. The rubber on my shoes stuck slightly to the rotting carpetting inside. I regret not bringing a paint respirator or something. I opened the cabinet slowly, the creak reverberating shallowly against the walls of the office. I pulled out a random folder and set it on the desk, the only surface in the room free from rot and dust.



I’m not going to reproduce everything in these files. We were biding our time until we were hopefully rescued. Once that post was made, there really was nothing for us to do, so we just started reading the files. It was a way to pass the time. But I don’t want to bore you with all the details, so I’m gonna provide a summary of each packet in the order we checked them out, and how the room changed each time with us taking turns pouring over the different files available. We counted six packets total. Each one was pretty large but full of tedious graphs and charts most of the time, with a couple exceptions. 



One of the first things we noticed is only one packet would be available at a time. The other papers would be blank. So, we started remembering which packets we pulled out after I drew a second one. Thankfully, I hadn’t put the first one back. 



As for the first one, it was a Devorator Textiles end-of-year report. I took notes on my phone as I read. I couldn’t make out the date; it looked like it had been smudged out. The names were also smudged out. It was like someone was purposely omitting certain information. It said they made clothing here, surprising no one. It was mostly monetary reports. I noticed some of the numbers didn’t quite seem to add up, and there were clear pay-gaps between workers. The manager of the factory itself seemed to be paid thirty-six thousand dollars, while the workers were paid around seven hundred annually. I don’t know much about this kind of thing, but that seemed like one hell of a pay-gap. 



At the very end of the packet, there was a page detailed a financial transaction directly to the city of Fayetteville itself. This wasn’t mentioned anywhere else in it. 



I left the room and Jackson went it. I started typing this while I waited. He came out around twenty minutes later. Time didn’t really seem to pass outside. I was standing in the sun outside, checking on Paul’s body. He was about halfway submerged in the ground at this point. 



Jackson summarized his findings. 



He found an incident log regarding a death in the factory and another worker’s reaction to it. 



The names were smudged out, of course. It seemed the two employees worked alongside one another in the factory and lived nearby. They were married.



One day, the man’s arm got snatched into a machine. He bled out right in front of his wife. It was quick, according to the report, and was a result of a faulty machine alignment, whatever that means. She quit her job but began writing the factory and petitioning to close it down. There were detailed accounts of her efforts, as she literally stood in the middle of town and shouted about how much she hated the factory and its management. Progressively, her speeches became more and more hostile, and then one day, she mailed a dead bird to the factory. It had been crushed.



A chill went down my spine when he told me that as I remembered the bird we had seen when we first all walked in. I felt my heart skip a beat as Paul’s face flashed in my mind, but I quickly pushed it away and turned my attention back to Jackson, taking notes as he spoke. 



At that point, Devorator Textiles pursued legal action, of course. She stopped writing directly to the factor, but continued to preach hostility against the company, calling for employees to turn against the employers in favor of better work conditions. This, to, was met with legal action, and she spent a few nights in jail. 



After that, things were quiet for ‘nine months’, according to the documents. No one heard from her for a while.



And then one day, she turned up on the front porch, dead. And in her pocket was a note. 



It read, “The greedy pig will feed and feed, long after its mind fails. A rabid beast through and through, in its stomach stories it will tell.”



This was the end of the file. I assume the company went on for ten years afterwards, as updates were made throughout further detailing the event after the fact, with updates on years since the incident, without mentioning a date for a whatever reason. This was some kind of stain on their legacy that had consequences in some way in the years that followed, unsurprisingly. 



I went in next. Jackson started reviewing the footage again as I walked back in. I had a feeling he kept watching Paul’s death, trying to understand.



I needed to distract myself. I was starting to hear things around the factory that’d make me jump. It could have just been the building resettling, but sometimes I heard shouting outside, or something that at least sounded a lot like it.



I went into the office and shut the door behind me. Some of the partygoers in the painting had fallen, and you could now clearly see the silhouette of the hanged man on the branch of the tree. I walked silently over to the filing cabinet and pulled out a new document. 



It was a collection of annual safety inspection reports. The dates were, again, smudged out, and most personal names were as well. It seemed like once or twice a year they’d receive a safety inspection from a city office.



They should not have passed this inspections.



Every single report listed repairs and renovations the factory needed, but ended with them passing. Multiple times the same thing would carry over for multiple reports, and they just kept getting longer. By the end, they were discussing a black mold problem.



I looked through and tried to find a mention of the death of the worker man and his wife, but there was nothing. Just so, so many notes about machines needing to be repaired, floors redone from cracking due to uneven weight distribution, water damage and mold were rampant; this place wasn’t just dangerous to work at, it was gross.



And to be fair, factory jobs have always been dangerous. Even today. Power plant workers risk their lives everyday and work insanely long hours. But, they get paid well.



I was pretty sure most power plants wouldn’t have half of these comments though. Some of them were outright ridiculous. One read that a particular machine would regularly rip and stretch the fabric, and multiple workers lost fingers to it trying to save the textiles. 



After pouring over the records, I walked back out and Jackson took my place. 



We shut the door behind us each time we entered the office to reduce the chance of one ofus walking in and fucking things up. I sat on the ground silently writing, and a few minutes later, he came back out. 



“That was fast,” I said slowly. 



“It was an internal memo just talking about a bunch of complaints against the boss. He was known he being a ‘jokester’ and not in a good way. Seemed like he was a real asshole and it look way too long to fire his ass. A bunch of people quit due to his ‘jokes’, like lighting the linens on fire or hitting the workers. I’m not really sure where the punchline is in that,” Jackson responded, obviously trying to add some humor to our situation.



I couldn’t really see the joke at the moment. “Oh.”



“Yeah. There’s two more folders in there.”



“Guess it’s time for me to go in,” I sighed.



I walked back into the office. The paintings were gone and in their place, there were just discolored marks on the wall where they once were. I opened the filing cabinet and pulled out a new folder. It was blueprints of the factory and of some of the machines. I took notes on it and walked inside. Nothing really that exciting, at least to me. 



I walked out of the office and told Jackson about it. 



“Lame,” he muttered. “I’m gonna look at that final packet. We’ll figure it out from there.” He walked inside the office.



And then he called for me a moment later. “Dan, get in here!”



He sounded panicked. I rushed into the office. He was throwing papers around in a panic.



“The last one is just copies of this math formula,” he said, getting to the end of the packet and breathing heavily. He stared at the last page. “It’s just the same math problem, again and again.”



I walked over and looked down at the desk.



The paper read: 1900+(x1+x2+x3+x4+x5+x6)-x7=a 



“It’s a date,” I said quietly.



It was handwritten on each page. There was nothing else on it. 



I counted the number of pages. “There’s thirty-one pages in this document.”



He looked up at me. “Do you think even though the other ones are blank, the number of pages are the same?”



I shrugged. “I mean, they don’t change in appearance or size from what I’ve noticed. The pages are just blank.”



He collected each page and started pulling out the packets, counting each page. 



Then a horrible thought entered my mind.



“I left the work floor,” I said, the realization dawning on me. 



Jackson looked at me in horror. “Paul.”



I started walking to the door, and my hand froze on the handle. It was ice cold. I got a weird feeling from the door, the same one I had initially coming down here like I shouldn’t open it. 



We were officially deeper into the factory. There was no telling what’d await us on the other side. It could just be worn and broken, or the thing that killed the bird from before. 



Jackson stood behind me, with the packets in hand. “You took good notes right?”



“Yeah,” I said silently staring the door as an internal war waged in my mind. 



“Need me to open it?”



I let go of the handle. I was shaking. “Yeah, I think so.”



Jackson reached in front of me awkwardly and grabbed the door handle, flinching at the chill of the metal. He creaked it open. It slowly opened, and as it did we could hear industrial noises from inside. I braced myself for what we were about to see. 



And I was still shocked. 



There were people on the workfloor, operating the machines and making clothes. They all looked kind of desaturated though, like they were slightly faded. It made them stick out. 



We stood there in the doorway, just floored for the moment by what we saw. Then, without saying a word, we stepped out onto the workfloor. I walked over to someone. 



“Hey, do you think you can help me out?”



They didn’t respond.



“Hello?”



No reaction.



I turned back to Jackson. He shrugged and tried talking to someone himself. 



No one paid attention to us. Even if they bumped into us directly, it was like we were invisible. And they bumped into us, a lot. They couldn’t see us, obviously. They’d just instantly recover and continue with their business.



We went back to the office door.



Jackson slumped to the floor against the wall. “What the hell?”



“I’m gonna go back in the office,” I told him definitively. 



“I’ll stay here,” Jackson said, burying his head in his arms. 



I opened the office door. There was a man in a suit behind the desk, pouring over paperwork. A deep feeling of uneasiness set in.



And then the man looked up, lost in thought. He was staring right at me, but it was like he was looking through me.



My eyes grew wide. My skin crawled as I croaked out a name.



“Paul?”
