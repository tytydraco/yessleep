Hey, r/nosleep, I need to get this off my chest. I don’t know what I was expecting when I picked up that old VHS tape from the back of the thrift store. It was wedged in between a bunch of random boxes of junk — dust, tape, and all sorts of old electronics. The label was scratched off, and all it said was:
“THE VESSEL”

I know, I know. The curiosity got the best of me, and I thought it’d be some obscure horror flick or something I could laugh at with a few beers.

But when I played it? I wish I could forget.

I don’t know when the tape was made, but it was old. You could tell by the way the colors faded on the screen and how the static would roll over the image. It started with a title card — “Vessel Project: Trial 117” — and then it cut to black for about 30 seconds. I thought maybe my VCR was glitching, but then it came back. And that’s when I saw it.

A dimly lit room. A camera fixed on what looked like a surgical table, surrounded by old equipment. I could barely make out the shadows in the corners. The audio was muffled, but there was a soft, high-pitched whine that gave me a headache after a few minutes. Like the frequency was messing with the recording.

A man in a hospital gown appeared on the table. He wasn’t moving. Eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling. I thought it was a prank, maybe a snuff film or something, but then I saw the workers in the corner. They were wearing these faded white hazmat suits, and their faces… their faces were blank. No eyes. Just flat, smooth features like they were made of clay.

The camera zoomed in on the man’s face, and the high-pitched sound became unbearable. I had to turn the volume down, but something in the video changed.

The man’s eyes shifted. Not in the way a person would blink — it was like they slid to the side, too far. Too unnatural. And then the man’s mouth opened wide — too wide, like it was stretching beyond any normal human capacity. And that’s when I heard the voice. It was distorted, barely audible, but it was there.

It said:
“The Vessel is ready.”

The camera then cut to a close-up of the man’s chest, and something… crawled out from underneath his skin. It was small at first, like a little black shape, but it quickly grew into something huge, writhing inside of him. It moved, twisting in ways that were impossible for the human body.

Then the feed cut. The image went black again. I expected it to be over. But no. There was more.

The next shot was outside. The camera was now zooming in on a town. It looked like any small, rural town — but there was something off. The houses were too clean, almost too perfect. No life. No cars. No people walking. Just stillness.

Then a figure appeared in the distance. It was walking toward the camera, moving in jerky, unnatural steps. It was the man. Or at least, it looked like him. His face was still stretched out, but his eyes were fully black, like he had no irises or pupils at all.

The camera zoomed in as he got closer. And when it did…
He stopped.
Right in front of the lens.
And the screen began to flicker.

I froze. I don’t know why. It felt like he was staring through me.

Then came the final image: a hand — the man’s hand — reaching into the camera’s lens, stretching impossibly long until the entire screen was covered in black.

And then nothing. Just static.

I haven’t been able to get rid of the tape. I’ve tried to throw it out three times. Each time, it shows up in my living room, sitting on the couch like it’s waiting for me. And sometimes, when I wake up in the middle of the night, I hear the faint sound of static coming from somewhere in my house. When I check, I never find the source.

I’m afraid to even plug in my VCR now.

But the worst part?

I swear to God, sometimes I feel like I’m being watched. From inside the screen.
