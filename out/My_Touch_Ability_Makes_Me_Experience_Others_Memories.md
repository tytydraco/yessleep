Since My 10th Birthday, I Awakened A Power. A Power that let me experience people's memories when i touch them.
Sometimes it was a really happy memory, sometimes it was something tragic, sad, dark, funny. 

Once was a case about my gf and her friends. at first it was just the two of us spending our time together, traveling, eating alone - just the two of us, one day when we were kissing, i tried to go further....slowly my hand started going down but she stopped me halfway saying "i am not ready for this yet".

 I respected that and backed off since then i decided not to touch her until she say so.

It Has Been few months since we last met so i made her a call for a date but she refused saying she had other things to do. I got a little sad but later i let it go.

A few hours later she posted a photo of hers with her male friends partying, i was angry and sad at the same time but didn't say anything as to not spoil her mood. Later that day i suddenly met her on a street and decided to go talk to her. 

She ignored me as if i never existed. This time i didn't let her go and grabbed her arm and suddenly..... *zinggg. The Memories, i saw them, she was literally cheating on me with those male friends of hers and making them believe that i abuse her and blackmail her in doing s*x. She Shrugged my hand off her and went her own way. 

The next day i broke up with her and blocked all contacts with her , to be honest i was glad that i had this ability. if it weren't for it i probably wouldn't have got a wind of this.

one day i touched a fallen old man to get him up and suddenly *zinggg. As soon as i touched him, his memories flushed into my brain. And it wasn't a pleasent one, well in front of his eyes his son got  stabbed by a woman several times and his grandchild's head sqaushed like an applepie fallen on the floor and him being so helpless & powerless himself.

I puked right in front of him and that was the day i decided to wear gloves with a full coat, basically to avoid any type of skin contact from other person.

I recently shifted to new place and It was a very pleasent day. suddenly i had a craving for a hamburger so i decided to head to a Burger Shot which was opened two days before my arrival. with my gloves on i headed towards it and ordered a hamburger. it was rather a quite strange place with a mysterious spooky aura. 

Anyways my concentration shifted to the hamburger served to me. With a happy face i took a bite...... *zinggg. That day i realised that my ability also works on DEAD People......
