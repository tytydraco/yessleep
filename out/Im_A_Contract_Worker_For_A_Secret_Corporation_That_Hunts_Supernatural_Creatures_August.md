The best course of action was to remain calm. That was extremely difficult staring down a monster without any weapons on hand. My broken arm throbbed and I found it hard to stand with my bad leg trembling. August stood up uneven on his feet spitting out blood. His eyes made contact with mine giving a silent signal he had some sort of a plan. I just needed to trust him. 

He had been taking in magic trying to recover his wounds. Something was wrong. The flow looked find and yet he kept stopping before he had enough. June wasn’t holding the power back or taking it from him. So why wasn’t August able to go beyond a certain amount? 

“Care to humor us with a villain monologue?” August joked causing June to pause. 

The monster narrowed his good eye at us, his mouth curling into a cruel smile. 

“I don’t mind prolonging your suffering.” He rasped nearby making it clear he could kill us at any moment. “You did do me a favor by giving that human permission to open our ancestor's grave.” 

June’s glare was directed toward me. August swiftly stepped in front ready to defend his weaker friend. 

“I would kill Richmond before you made him into your puppet.” August replied in a cold voice. 

I knew he was serious. And I would prefer that outcome. August couldn’t be infected so I assumed that also included adding magic threads in his brain to control his body. It explained why June waited so long to lure August here if his main goal was to get inside the tomb. 

“He doesn’t need to be alive to open the door.” June pointed out. 

His deep rolling laughter froze my blood. August just wanted to protect his sister from such a heavy burden by giving it to me. Now we risked the wrong person getting a hold of a great deal of power. 

“Is that collar giving you issues? The choice you made to protect poor little April is going to be this worlds downfall.” June hissed then cackled. 

August had made a deal. Him and April would become leashed in exchange for their lives. That came at a cost of his true strength. The collar limited how strong he could become so he would be easier to control. An idea came to me and I knew I needed to act on it quickly. First, we needed to get June distracted for at least an entire minute. With some luck I may be able to buy us thirty seconds. 

As June kept speaking, I carefully started to gather as much magic as I could in my left hand waiting for the right moment. 

“Our species had enough power hidden away to save ourselves but your father was too stubborn and refused. You both failed us and look at what we became. Barely holding on because of those disgusting humans. Your father always said he wanted to find an answer to resolve our conflict while ignoring the simplest solution. I refuse to be like him. I’ll take what has been rightfully left behind to erase everything! A clean slate! No more humans or creatures who refused to answer our call for help!” 

I wish I could blame June for feeling the way he did. I understood why he turned out this way even though his pure hatred scared me to the bone. His voice echoed through the trees yelling to make sure he got his point across. To me he appeared like a misguided hurt child. To August he was an unacceptable threat. 

My friend moved before I could call out to him. June easily swatted him away with a massive clawed hand. He slashed August across the chest causing his blood to spray across the ground. He still got back up again and again. He had accepted his death the moment we arrived. Since he was a father, he refused to stand down whenever someone threatened his child. I couldn't bear to see him slowly be ripped apart. I put some strength into my legs to give a boost so I could slam my left hand into June’s chest with everything I had been collecting until that point. 

August had been knocked to the ground, bruised and bloody watching in horror at my actions. He shouted something I didn’t hear. The outburst of magic should have knocked June back. Instead, he stood strong with new cracks forming on his face with signs of something glittering under his skin. 

I was so stupid.  

A clawed hand shot out digging four fingers into my stomach. I froze in too much shock to react. If I moved, I would start bleeding out.  

June was born here. He might as well be the same as all the plants and soil of this mountain. The magic I used was also a part of him. His body took it in without any issue making him stronger. And I was on the verge of death because of it. 

“You look so scared dear little August. Don’t worry. I’ll keep you alive. I plan on creating a new village of our species after I destroy everything else. I’ll need your help with that. April is only a half breed but she’ll be fine for the pair of us to-” 

He wasn’t able to finish his taunts. I lashed out sinking a small knife I picked up earlier deep into the open mouth on his chest. It hurt him enough to fling my body off his claws. I didn’t have enough time to recover. I hit the ground hard and looked up in time to see a massive burst of white light about to crash into me. 

Even if this blast didn’t hit me, I would have died in a few minutes from my stomach wounds. August should have fled to save himself. Acting like a true older brother he wrapped his arms around my shoulders, his back facing the blast to use his body as a shield. 

He could have just blocked the magic however he pulled it toward his back to limit the damage to a small area behind him. He hadn’t just been protecting an injured human. Due to his sacrifice, he kept a tree a few feet away untouched. It was a smaller pine that grew slightly crooked that reminded me of who had been born underneath it. Even now he was protecting his little sister. 

His dress shirt had been burned away as well as a layer of flesh to reveal his jet-black insect body underneath. His breathing was low and uneven. Dark hair fell over his still human face hiding his expression. August caught my eye then glanced to the side trying to silently tell me something important.  

His movements had been carefully planned out since June started speaking. Without anyone noticing he drew a large square in the snow with his blood. It was a bit messy but would work for what he had planned. His hand reached out to give my chest a gentle push at the same time he opened the connection. 

Doorways or portals made with blood and other offerings were far more powerful than normal spells. August had even included the bodies of the humans he had killed to provide power for this. I didn’t know where it would take me but I knew we had a few seconds before June reached the edge of the blood to destroy the only way out. 

If I fell through the escape August had made then the world would be saved. I could get help and stop June at the cost of a friend. He was perfectly fine throwing away his life for the people he cared about. 

I wasn’t. 

Digging in my heels I leaned forward my broken arm out stretched. Gritting my teeth I did something that would hurt us both. A lot. June was focused on severing the connection meaning we had a few seconds before he could attack again.  

August was born here as well. He should be able to take in magic to recover the same way June had. I pulled as much as I could through the ground and into my left hand holding his. I’ve never moved so much magic before. My brain shut down. I couldn’t even breath through the pain and yet I pressed on.  

August was at his limit. The power pressed against his body causing him to scream and claw at his chest. I refused to let go no matter how much he would hate me for this. 

His collar was nothing like Aprils. Hers was so simple and had been easy to alter. The collar around his neck was countless magic threads that looped in onto itself. I couldn’t find the end because there wasn’t one. The power I would need to break the spell work was immense. Maybe if I shifted the entire mountains worth of magic, I could have erased the tattoo. My body would have burned up way before I grabbed that much power. No, I decided to do something else to it. I needed to change the tattoo to something else that could be broken, thus breaking the spell.  

I didn’t think that was possibly by sheer willpower. Normally spells needed to be altered using writing or a complex system most weren’t aware of. I didn’t have the time. I just brute forced it. Before August was torn apart from too much magic the black tattoo around his neck lifted transforming into a thin black string.  

It was easy to snap. When an item embedded with a spell is destroyed the spell is also broken. If a paper charm is ripped, the spell is lost. August had part of his body taken over by the collar. He would have needed to die for it to be broken. When the collar took a different shape, it was possible to break it and not him. That came at a cost.  

The backlash knocked me off my feet. June already closed the way but he was also knocked back when I broke the black thread. I could have been passed out for a few seconds or a full minute.  

I found myself on my back staring up at the sky confused for a moment over where I was. The pain hadn’t reached my senses yet. I knew I was cold and I should be doing something. My ears rang as I debated on just going to sleep. If I closed my eyes everything would be over. Deep down I wanted that. I owed it to people I loved to sit back up. 

My movements were sluggish. I rolled slightly to use my right arm to sit up forgetting I had broken bones earlier. For some odd reason my body wasn’t working right. The collar breaking created a backlash so intense it took away more than my sense. Finally, I sat up, staring down trying to see why my right hand refused to work.  

It simply wasn’t there. My arm ended at the elbow in a burnt stump. Oddly enough, I wasn’t upset. The shock settled in keeping the pain away. It made sense that I would lose an arm from doing something to reckless as breaking such a well-crafted collar spell. The blast also re-opened the wounds in my stomach. How long did I have until I bled out? A few minutes? Even less? 

When I pulled my eyes away reality sank in. Fear overtook my brain as a throbbing pain came from every muscle. When I saw what stood in front of me, I knew the risk had been worth it. 

The last few pieces of August’s old black shell-like body parts fell away revealing a crystalized creature underneath. His hair shone silver flowing as if he was underwater. Countless reflections of light sparked around him even at the slightest of movements. His long legs hovered slightly as a pair of pear wings kept him afloat with an unseen power. 

A steady river of power flowed from the ground into his body looking as if it would never fill up. This was different than June. He had wanted to destroy everything. The magic he took in turned vile from his hatred. He had been clawing at the ground forcing the mountain to give him want he wanted.  

August sacrificed his family and nearly his life for his home. Now, it was finally paying him back.  

June fell back terror clear on his scarred face. He knew he didn’t have a chance and yet he still struggled. He threw everything he had in the last few attacks. August finally moved. His clawed toes touched the ground with a faint crystal chime. The snow around us shot up creating a field of powered diamonds. Deep green grass sprouted and flowers bloomed. Within a blink of an eye a patch of summer over took the small space. 

He moved so fast I didn’t see him. August stopped in front of June slightly hovering over the swaying blooms looking at his family member with large pearl-like eyes. June relaxed accepting his fate almost appearing glad this was all finally over. He had been hurting for so long. The path he almost went down would have created more hardships and anger. And at the very least he was glad to see someone who he spent his childhood with in his last moments. 

A hand was placed on the side of his face. A gentle movement that was too much for his body. Thousands of cracks appeared then June was overtaken by the sheer force of the placed he wanted to destroy. His body exploded into thousands of sharp pieces. When they embedded themselves into trees or the ground more plants sprang to life from them.  

I felt a weird sensation on my face and in my chest. Two of those shards had hit me. A flower burst to life spreading out from under my skin covering my left eye. I felt roots bury deep inside my lung and rapidly spread outwards. Based on how fast they were spreading I had seconds left. Turns out I wouldn’t bleed to death. 

August noticed me sitting on the ground about to pass out from pain. He was no longer himself. The will of the mountain had taken over his body. There was a chance he would remain here like a God protecting this place. Was that a bad thing? My brain couldn’t think any more. I started to drift off when August appeared next to me. His hand outstretched. I had been so afraid of death countless times and yet when I was this close to it, I just was too tired to care. 

“Richie?” 

My eyes closed refusing to open. I still heard his voice. I knew that wasn’t a hallucination. That I needed to hold on for one more second. His hand pressed against my chest. My breathing stopped. Then there was nothing for a very long time. 

How many times had I cheated death in my short life? More than any person should. I became aware of my breathing first. Then the dull pain came back. My head pounded and I felt so stiff. All of that didn’t matter because I had to pee. 

I rolled falling to the floor. My legs refused to work right. It took ages for me to reach the connected bathroom to finish my business. Once that was done and I washed my face I needed to see the damage. 

The first thing I noticed was a new right arm. It was scarred where the old and the new were connected. It didn’t look like my old one. And it felt... strange. I don’t know how I knew to flex it in a way to make it transform into black plated one with dark claws. It just worked. I could only hold it in that form for a few seconds. My body shut down as I gasped feeling like I ran ten miles on top of not eating or drinking for ten years. My body felt so drained in ways I never realized someone could feel. 

This must be what it was like for a supernatural creature when they ran out of magic. It sucked. A lot. 

I drank from the tap for a full minute before looking at myself in the mirror. I looked awful. I needed a haircut. The bags under my eyes made the rest of my face appear pale. A new set of scars were under my left eye. It looked like someone had taken a small knife tip to make scratches in my skin from where the flowers ripped out from. My stomach appeared the same but also with three round scars from where June landed a blow. 

But I was alive.  

I wasn’t at a clinic though. I knew I was in August's place based on all the drawings Lucas made taped to the wall. I walked back into the bedroom feeling downright awful. 

The door opened as someone I didn’t expect to see greeted me. 

“You look like crap.” August said after he gave me a look over. 

His skin was paler but he looked fine. His internal magic source was perfect and he lacked a black ring around his neck. A new streak of silver was in his hair that he loosely tied back. He looked so great I felt a little bitter over it. 

“Thanks. I feel like crap.” I said in a hoarse voice. “But really, thank you.” I said and lifted up the new right arm. 

I had been certain he had cut his off as a replacement. But he stood with both arms at his side. He realized I was confused and raised his right arm to pinch and stretch the skin. 

“I made a crystal one and put fake skin over it. It works just as good as the old one.” He explained. 

I was glad it was so simple. I was still paying off my leg so I knew how much replacement limbs could cost. 

“Do me a favor and don’t do anything nasty with it.” August said grimacing. 

“We are never going to even think about that.” I replied shutting down that train of thought. 

I sighed and got us back on track. I wanted to know how I was still standing. Magic was, well magic. But it still had rules. My body would have been overloaded if he tried to heal all my wounds at once. 

“You should head to a clinic soon. I put you under a Sleeping Beauty spell but I’m not sure if all the roots were removed.” August said answering most of my questions. 

I’ve heard of that spell concept before. It was tricky to do so it wasn’t done unless there were no other options. It would freeze the injured person and slowly heal their wounds over time as they slept. When they woke up depended on a few factors. Use too little magic and they woke up before all the injuries healed. Put in too much and the person would keep sleeping even after they were fine. In some cases, a person slept for over a hundred years. One wrong move and August could have put me to sleep forever. 

“How long was I out for?” I asked. 

“Sixty years.” He shrugged. When I didn’t react to the joke he admitted the real answer. “Three weeks. You’re sturdy so it took way less time than I expected. I dusted you off but you might have eaten some spiders.” 

I’d gotten lucky again. That luck was bound to run out. I really needed to start being more careful from now on. 

“Thanks. I owe you.” I told him fully meaning those words. 

“No, we’re even.” His tone suddenly sounded oddly heavy. “When they told me about Lucas I just... gave up. I thought that because of what I was there wouldn’t be any point trying to change things. You’re human. And yet you fight against supernatural creatures as if you’re on equal terms with them. Sure, it hurts. You need to work harder than most. And there is no guarantee you'll live each time. I think seeing that made me realize I needed to use what I am and not run from it.” 

His words should have sounded warm and comforting. Instead, a cold pit started in my stomach. My throat became dry as I refused to think about what he could be talking about. I could have pretended to be ignorant. If I asked him to make a door to my apartment, I would have avoided the truth at least for a short while longer. 

 A sound came from downstairs distracting us. 

“Lucas is home. Come and say hello to him.” 

August turned away and I followed. My body moving on its own. I did want to see the boy was fought so hard to keep in our lives. I just feared what else August did while I had been asleep. 

Lucas finished taking off his shoes when we reached the first landing on the stairs. He saw me his face flushing with excitement. He nearly knocked me over in a tight hug. I was still too weak to pick him up so I leaned down to squeeze him back apologizing for not seeing him for so long. Lucas instantly forgave me. He was a smart kid who saw how tired I looked. I promised him I would come again soon but I needed to head home for the day. He understood then with another hug he headed off to the kitchen to make a snack.  

I straightened up with August at my back ready to face the two people still standing in the doorway.  

Lucas’s aunt and uncle smiled in our direction, their eyes appearing so lifeless. My eyes focused hard until I saw small flickering threads woven into their skulls made of pure magic. If they were removed, they would die. Simple as that. August accepted himself as a monster and created a perfect family for his adopted son. All of their actions for the rest of their lives would only be done to make Lucas happy. 

My muscles tensed up as August slipped his arms around my neck in an embrace resting his head on my shoulder. 

“Don’t worry. I won’t use the threads on you because you’ll never upset Lucas, right?” he said in a low whisper. 

Carefully I nodded feeling sweat start at the back of my neck. There was nothing I could do to help the two people nearby. I could only hope August was reasonable and forgiving when it came to his son. 

Within the next few minutes, I got back home. The weight of everything that happened finally hit me when I closed the door. Slumping against it I sat on the floor unable to process my thoughts. 

Sure, those two weren’t the best people to raise Lucas but what August did was inhuman. And that was the point. He never claimed to be anything aside from a monster who loved a human child.  

I flexed the hand he’d given me uncertain of my feelings. It was as if I was slowly becoming further away from the person I thought I was. The person my mother wanted me to be. The person who Ito first saw.  

The pain in my bad leg flared up. It hadn’t been healed by the spell August used. I needed to get that looked at soon. I slowly got up to try to sleep avoiding the countless questions I didn’t have the answers for.
