Hey, everyone. It's been a few days, and I wanted to give you an update. For starters even if I disagreed with a lot of the comments about Cassandra and the more...colorful ones about her. I don't think she's poisoning me or trying to kill me, tonight I think her coworkers were utterly deranged but I'll get to that in a minute. If Cassandra really wanted to do something to me she'd have already done it, I've slept with her already for fuck sake so if she wanted to kill me she's had every opportunity before.




But anyway, Cassandra had to go out of town for a family emergency, so I decided to go back to work, following everyone's advice I'd give Roberts my two weeks notice after my shift and tell them to find someone else, I was done working for them and the pay wasn't that good either.









Let's just say shit got real tonight.




The night started off normal, the nurses were being extremely polite with me and they even brought me some snacks and coffee that made me stay awake better throughout the night. Usually my shift ran from nine PM to six AM, then me and Cassandra would go home until the next night. I ended up coming in early so I came in at eight forty PM.





I was doing my usual rounds, checking the camera feeds and making sure everything was in order. But I noticed something strange on one of the screens around eleven PM. It was in one of the rooms on the lower floor – a storage room I hadn't paid much attention to before.




There was something wrong with the room that caused me to stare at it for a few minutes, like I was seeing something I wasn't supposed to. In the dim light, I could make out a figure, a silhouette of a person standing in the corner of the room. Their posture was unnatural, almost contorted, and they didn't move. It was like they were frozen in place.



It looked like a doctor from his clothing but his back was entirely too hunched over. It looked like he had a serious disability from how his body was formed. His arms were long and nearly reaching the floor. With his legs being bent at a 45° degree angle and his feet were contorted in the wrong direction.




I thought I was going completely fucking insane while looking at this thing or person. Whatever it was, it knew I was there. It was looking directly at the camera. But I couldn't see it's face, just the outline of it's head looking in my direction. 





And then, in the blink of an eye, it was gone. The room was empty, as if nothing had ever been there. I rubbed my eyes and blinked a few times, convinced that I was just tired and my imagination was playing tricks on me. 



I couldn't call the police about seeing that. I mean who would believe me?



That reminds me. I told Cassandra I've been getting weird visions lately and seeing things out of the corner of my eyes whenever I'm tired. Just weird little blips of something I can't make it for a second before disappearing. I guess she told the nurses because they've been coming up to the security room every other hour and giving me small bottles of medicine and coffee. I swear if they weren't staring daggers at me with those creepy smiles I'd feel thankful. But it's just been unnerving to me.





One of the younger nurses and a friend of Cassandra's named Kathy likes to hang around the security room for an hour or two. At first I told her I didn't really think it was a good idea, what if a patient needed help?




She said something along the lines of "I can see everything on the cameras, I'll be fine."




After a back and forth I dropped it and started fiddling with my Taser, trying to get it out of the holster a few times to show Kathy but just making myself look like an idiot.


While Kathy was in the security room with me, she asked me to focus on a specific room through the cameras. I obliged, not having much else to do. I adjusted the camera feed to the room she mentioned.




As I stared at the monitor paranoidly expecting the same Monster to be standing there and gutting a patient alive, Kathy launched into a long-winded story about a troublesome patient they had once dealt with As I scanned the empty patient room. She described the patient's bizarre behavior, his constant ramblings about nonsensical topics like the moon would be crashing down and something like Jesus coming back and killing every sinner. Insane shit like that I was having listening to, and she was talking about how he had vanished from the hospital one night, only to return weeks later with no memory of where he had been.



I listened to her story, it wasn't like I could do anything else, my eyes occasionally flicking between the camera feed and Kathy as she spoke. And then it struck me randomly.



"Didn't this room belong to Mr. Wilson last week?" I blurted out without really meaning to.




Kathy's expression shifted from one of thinking about her story to mild surprise as she turned her attention to the camera feed. "Mr. Wilson? Who? No, Matthew, nobody's been in that room for the past three weeks except for one patient who stayed for a day and then left."




Her response left me really confused. My memory albeit really shitty lately was clear on this – I distinctly remembered there being an older man named Mr. Wilson being in that room just last week. I couldn't make sense of it. Kathy's annoyed look deepened, and I felt like I had once again touched on something that I shouldn't have.


"Are you sure?" I asked, my voice in a more confused tone.


Kathy sighed, her irritation becoming really evident as she stared right into my eyes. "Yes, Matthew, I'm sure. Sometimes you see things on those little screens that aren't really there. It's a trick of the mind after you've been working long and aren't paying attention. Now, can we please drop it? I've had a long day." Her irritation was getting more and more clear as I brought it up.




"But Kathy," I started again. "I saw an old man in that room. He was tall, had a golden watch on his wrist, and I swear, he was there just last week. His family rarely visited him, just like Alex. And his-"




Before I could say more, Kathy's demeanor changed drastically. Her face contorted with anger, she stood up and she yelled at me, her voice demanding as she pointed at me, "Shut up, Matthew! Let me finish my oddamn story! Stop talking about him!"





I recoiled at her outburst, shocked by her sudden anger as she went back to try and tell her story about the room's patient months ago. 



But as I looked at her I sort of



Noticed something.





her eyes. 





They were the same shade of amber as Cassandra's.





"Your eyes," I blurted out, almost without thinking. "They're the same shade as Cassandra's."



Kathy's demeanor suddenly shifted. She stiffened, her gaze narrowing at me, and I could feel the atmosphere in the room grow tenser.



"What about them?" she replied, her tone sharp and defensive.





I quickly realized my comment had struck a nerve, and I tried to backpedal. "I didn't mean anything by it. It's just... Well, it's a unique eye color. I was just curious if it's common around here or something. Cassandra has the same color and-"





Kathy's eyes remained fixed on me, her expression neutral. "It's just a coincidence," she snapped, her tone was extremely monotone and strict. "There's no need to read too much into it."




An awkward silence hung in the air between us, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I had crossed a line. I returned my focus to the camera feed, trying to distract myself from the tension in the room.





but then, about ten minutes later, as Kathy was leaving the security room, she placed her gloved hand on my shoulder. her voice was low and filled with an unsettling calmness. "You know, Matthew, some things are better left unknown. Curiosity can be a dangerous thing."




And with that ominous remark, she walked out of the room, leaving me stunned as to what exactly I did wrong. Maybe I offended her by bringing up Cassandra?



I don't know. I still don't know what exactly I did wrong there.



It was after thirty minutes a nurse came by and gave me a cup of coffee and she quickly slammed the door before I had a chance to ask her if Kathy was alright. 



Still, I welcomed the much needed boost, hoping it would help me shake off the lingering sense of dread. But as I sipped the coffee, a strange fatigue washed over me, a heaviness that made it increasingly difficult to stay awake. It's like drinking the coffee was having the exact opposite effect despite me enjoying it a lot earlier. It's even how I usually take my coffee, Iced is always the best for me staying up.







I decided at that exact moment I needed to take a walk downstairs to the nurse's station. Looking back I don't exactly understand why I wanted to, but after a few minutes of me trying to not fall asleep I felt like I needed to go down and talk to someone.




But when I arrived, something was off. The nurses were all sitting there, their eyes fixed on me with an intensity that sent shivers down my spine. It was as if they were waiting for something, like a Mother waiting to scold her child after he admitted he had done something wrong.




I felt an extreme sense of embarrassment wash over me, and I couldn't understand why at all. It was like I had been caught doing something I shouldn't have, even though I had no idea what that might be.






In the midst of this uncomfortable silence, I turned to Kathy, my voice was groggy as I tried to stay awake. "Kathy, I'm so sorry if I upset you earlier. I didn't mean to pry or make you uncomfortable."




To my surprise, Kathy's expression softened, and she offered a reassuring smile. "It's fine, Matthew. No harm done with it."





As she spoke, something really weird happened. The Nurses, who had been watching me with such intensity, began to smile as well. It was as if a collective tension had been released, and their demeanor shifted from one of silent scrutiny to something more welcoming as they smiled and stared at me.




Then Kathy leaned in closer and whispered, "Matthew, why don't you take off for the rest of the night? You look tired. I'll drive you home."





Her offer was unexpected, but at that moment, the idea of leaving the hospital was incredibly tempting. I nodded in agreement, my gratitude evident. "Thank you, Kathy. I appreciate it."







And then… I don't remember what else happened. I remember walking to my car but I woke up just now in my bed with my sheets washed and my eyes hurting. Cassandra should be coming home in a few hours. 



I think I'm going to talk with Cassandra tomorrow and tell her directly I'm quitting and I'm not coming back even to deliver my two weeks. I'm going to eat something Cassandra made for us both a while ago. It's this delicious steak she bought from somewhere she won't tell me but it's alright. It tastes fine for now.





I don't know what to think but I think those Nurses did something to me. I don't want to upset Cassandra so I don't want to call the police, plus, what could they do? Take me to that exact hospital where they could do something worse to me?




My head's been fucking killing me all day and I feel like I'm forgetting something else, but that's all I remember for now.



I'm going to be alright, I'll update you guys tomorrow if something happens. Hopefully the next entry will be my final post and I'll upload a copy of my resignation here and anything else that happens.
