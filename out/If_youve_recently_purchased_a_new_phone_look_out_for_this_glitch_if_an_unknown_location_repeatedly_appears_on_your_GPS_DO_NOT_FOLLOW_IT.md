My spouse has been missing for three days now. It doesn’t make any sense. We have no enemies. Tai wasn’t having an affair (we have an open, poly relationship, and both of us occasionally have other partners and tell each other when we do). The only new thing in our lives was Tai’s phone. Some fancy newfangled Google device with snazzy never-before-seen apps. I’m not all that into gadgets, but Tai wouldn’t stop talking my ear off about it in the days before it finally arrived, sleek and gleaming in its little white box.

I wouldn’t mention the new phone at all, except…

Well. I have *one* idea about where my missing spouse might have gone. It happened on the second or third morning after the new phone arrived. I was only half paying attention to Tai’s excited babble: “… turns black and white at night because it knows that’s time for me to sleep. Isn’t it smart? And see, I have everything organized so I can find stuff super easy. Here’s my transit folder for all my transit apps and—oops. Huh… that’s *weird.*”

“What?” The “weird” part finally piqued my interest.

“Oh, nothing, just… some sort of glitch. It keeps showing me this same location on my maps. I don’t know why. Anyway, look, I saved some restaurant recommendations and you can see which ones are close to us…”

We ended up going to one of the restaurants Tai recommended later that evening. But, funnily enough, the unknown location popped up again on the GPS when we were walking downtown… and *again* on our way home. “Man,” Tai groaned. “Maybe it’s like… that location is listed as our home for some reason…”

“Where is it?” I asked.

“I don’t know! It just looks like some random building. Oh, hey! Wanna go there?”

I slid a sideways look to my beloved. Tai’s always been the extrovert in our relationship. Curious, mischievous, partying, gadget-loving. Superficially we’re very similar—in fact a lot of people assume we’re siblings, since we’re both Asian and of similar build (we even swap clothes a lot—though I’m generally more goth, while Tai is more Midwest flannel and jeans). But our personalities are polar opposites. I’m a total hermit and strongly prefer the familiar to anything too new.

Take my phone for example. Unlike Tai’s fancy new thing, mine’s a cracked old brick that doesn’t even get group texts half the time. Heck, even the regular texts sometimes don’t show up, instead popping up hours, days, or even weeks late. My birthday’s in May, and I’ve gotten happy birthday messages as late as July. I call these “ghost texts.” But I’d rather keep my janky old phone than have to learn a new one.

Of course, eventually I’ll cave—and it’ll probably be Tai who gets me my next phone and teaches me how it works—but for now, I’m satisfied with my brick.

Anyway… I had no interest in a long walk out of our way to see some unknown location somewhere, so I suggested we grab dessert, then head home and watch some of our shows. Tai’s bright eyes dimmed with disappointment, but they relented, and so we spent a cozy evening on the couch with our cats.

A couple of days later, around 10pm, we exchanged the series of texts that would be our last:

TAI: Hey, I’ll likely be out till late. At a union event.

ME: Oh. Do you need me to come pick you up?

ME: What time?

ME: What time should I come?

ME: Tai?

TAI: No, don’t come

TAI: I’ll find a ride

TAI: Probably going to be out till pretty late. You should get some sleep. 😘😴 Unless you wanna come to the party?

ME: Ew, no. Only if u need a ride home

TAI: Don’t worry, I’m fine. I love you.

TAI: 😘❤️🥰

ME: ❤️❤️❤️

ME: eta?

ME: Tai? Eta?

… but there were never any more messages. These are the last messages Tai ever wrote to me. And I have read them over, and over, and over…

\*\*\*

So what happened? I checked Tai’s computer for information about this “union event” and reached out to a few of their coworkers the next morning, only to have my anxiety skyrocket into panic when I was told there *was no union event* that night.

One of Tai’s colleagues, Jessica, asked whether I was sure Tai was being honest with me. Of course I was. Why wouldn’t I be? But Tai does like to play pranks. They’d do stuff to mess with me all the time. Little things. Like letting me lead us the wrong way when we were out walking, because Tai has an excellent sense of direction and I don’t, just strolling hand-in-mine quietly laughing until I’d finally realize I’d gotten us completely lost. Or like the time our parking garage was repainted. Tai tracked how many days it would take me to notice, and would say stuff like, “Hey, is there a spider on the wall?”—dropping subtle hints. It took me three weeks, six days.

It's true that I live too much in my own head. Whereas, Tai is very much out in the world and plays too much, buys too much, works too much, adrift like a balloon that will float away without a tether. I am the tether. It's how we balance each other.

Balanced.

These past few days I’ve been such a mess. None of our friends know where my spouse is. NONE OF THEM. Nor any of our family. And yeah, obviously, I contacted the police. They think it’s an affair. I told them the same thing I told Tai’s colleague Jessica—why would Tai sneak around? What would be the point when we both date other people anyway? That got some raised eyebrows, and they just told me people have all kinds of reasons to hide things from each other. That maybe I don’t know my spouse as well as I thought I did.

But our cats. Tai would *never* leave our cats. Our maine coon, Luna, is Tai’s baby. Even if Tai would leave me (and I’m not entertaining that idea—we would *talk* about things first, would communicate—we wouldn’t ghost each other), Tai would never leave Luna.

None of it makes *any* sense.

And finally, just this evening, I found something.

In the pocket of Tai’s jeans—a glossy blue phone, its maps app open and the GPS showing an unknown location.

\*\*\*

Why would Tai leave their phone with me? How did they text me from the “union event” if their phone was here? Or… did they return and slip it into the pocket of those jeans sometime while I was out this evening? But… why? Why do such a thing? Why leave it for me instead of just *calling?*

I closed out the map and opened the messages—checking to see if Tai had communicated with anyone besides me in recent days. But no. Their very last messages were the ones with me. That same series of texts, plus the ones I sent that went unanswered through the night: “Tai? Are you ok?” “Please call me” “I’m seriously worried, call me now” “Tai PLEASE call NOW” and on and on and on, until my eyes blurred with tears and I had to stop reading and put the phone down.

Finally I picked it up again and looked at the maps. That unknown location marked by the GPS. I shivered.

*Tai, did you go there without me, and now you want me to come?*

The sight of that dot on the GPS filled me with an irrational terror. Obviously I had to go, but… *everything* about this felt wrong. Whereas my beloved saw that little blue dot as a curiosity, a mystery to be solved—I looked and saw a warning. *Danger*. Dread coiled in my belly and squeezed my lungs. Oh Tai… where was I when you needed to be tethered back to earth? I grabbed my bag, shoving my phone and Tai’s in there. I messaged my family. It was near midnight, so I didn’t expect a response from anyone—but I wouldn’t make the mistake of vanishing without informing everyone. Going out alone at this hour was probably not the best idea—and definitely not the kind of thing that Avery, the introvert, usually did.

But it didn’t matter.

Out of my comfort zone, one more time, for Tai.

\*\*\*

Following the GPS brought me to an apartment building.

It was a place I’d never been—and because the map kept rerouting when I got close, the only way I eventually found it was by ditching my car and walking. Even then, the map rerouted one more time, forcing me to walk another 15 minutes on the chilly streets of downtown.

And while I’m very familiar with the downtown area, somehow I wound up on a block I didn’t recognize, in front of a building I’d never seen before. Though I did observe, looming in the distance, the bright blue rooftop lights of the office building I used to work in, and the yellow upper floors of the banking building where Tai works, and where we both met more than a decade ago. These landmarks gave me some sense of direction.

I sent a pin with the location to the family group text.

And then I approached the empty apartment building, dim inside except for a few lights leading to the elevator lobby—

—*Bzzzzz*—I jumped at my phone’s vibration.

MOM: gotta cancel tmw

It was a ghost text from last week, popping up in the family group chat. My heart sank (some part of me had been secretly hoping that it would be Tai). I tucked my phone into my back pocket and tried the front door, but it was locked. A metal call box hung on the wall to my left. Had Tai come to this same call box three nights ago?

Suddenly, static spat: “BBBZZZZZT…. BZZZZZT… Avery?”

My heart all but stopped. “Tai?” I gasped.

“… Avery, you’re here? BBZZZZZT … up?”

“TAI!” I shouted. “Are you OK? Where are you?”

“… n’t hear you. Come up to the rooZZZZZT.”

Abruptly, there was a loud buzz as the apartment door opened, and I rushed into the lobby and to the elevator. Had Tai said “roof”? I pressed the uppermost floor. The whole way, questions flooded my mind: Why would Tai be here? How had their phone gotten to me after they went missing? What happened three days ago at almost *this* exact time as I was heading up, right now? But my heart wouldn’t listen to my brain’s logic, because Tai was here! *Here!* Waiting on the roof! They didn’t sound scared over the call box. Only surprised. Like they were glad I’d come. Like they’d been waiting—

—then the elevator doors opened and I rushed out and through a door marked “authorized entry only” but held ajar by a doorstop because coming from beyond were lights and sounds. Up a narrow flight of stairs, I emerged to the roof—

Thumping music. Dazzling lights. A party. Oh, wow. And it was *lit*.

Then Tai was in front of me, pulling me into a hug. “Avery! You made it! I didn’t think you were coming!”

“Tai? Oh my God!” I squeezed them fiercely, all my questions forgotten as I nearly spilled the cup of beer out of their hand. “It’s been three days! How could you? How could you let me worry like this—”

“What?” Tai pulled back and examined me, looking bewildered. “No it hasn’t! The party just started!”

“No! It’s Tuesday! You messaged me on Saturday! Look!” I pulled out their phone.

“Oh you found my phone!”

“But how did you message me—"

“I can’t hear you.” Tai shook their head. “Music’s too loud. Come on. Let’s go somewhere quieter and talk.”

And strange as this all was, my fear evaporated. I’d found Tai, and any explanations we could figure out later. The important thing was that we were together. We wove through the crowd, passing coworkers Tai greeted with banter and smiles. Again, a prickle of confusion as I peered at their faces through the reverberating music. Hadn’t these union people said there was no meeting? Tai laughed when I mentioned Jessica, and said Jessica didn’t know about this party. She recently quit their leadership team and hadn’t been involved much in events. Then Tai guided me toward a ladder leading up to a brightly lit hot tub. In a flash, they’d undressed and scampered up the ladder, wiry and scrawny in their plaid boxers.

“Come on, let’s sit in the hot tub! We can talk and look out over the city.”

“I don’t have my swim clothes—”

“Quit acting so old. Just strip to your undies and come on!”

I sighed. This was definitely one of those push-pull moments where I wanted to be a homebody and Tai wanted to be adventurous. Grumbling, I stripped off my jacket and shirt and jeans and gripped the ladder.

The cold steel bit into my hands. It was steeper than I imagined, and the stinging wind almost unbearable. With each rung, the air seemed more frigid. By the time I got to the lip of the hot tub, my whole body had numbed.

“God, it’s so fucking cold…”

“Yeah? It’s nice and warm in here.” Tai was lounging at the far end of the jacuzzi, smiling.

I started to climb over the rim—but stopped at the *bzzzzz, bzzzz* of my phone. I’d brought it so I could take pictures. Glanced at the text onscreen.

TAI: No, don’t come

In the cold air, my eyes couldn’t focus for a second. Oh—a ghost text. I recognized it from the string of messages in our last communication. Sometimes I get repeats. I called to Tai, “Uh, you just texted and told me not to come.”

“Oh my God, please let me get you a new phone!”

And it was so Tai, the way their eyes crinkled. That laughter. So very, very Tai. Warmth flooded my chest, and I readied myself to jump in—

*—Bzzzzz—*

TAI: No, don’t come

Again?

I don’t know what it was about that repeat text, but… as the wind sliced me to my bones, I shifted my position back onto the ladder and told Tai through chattering teeth that I wanted to take a pic.

“Use my phone! It has a better camera.”

So I did. It was a beautiful picture. But the doubt and dread curdling in my stomach wouldn’t settle, so I called, “Lemme get a selfie, too!” I couldn’t tell you why, but I felt gripped with absolute terror. I just wanted to be home, hanging out at our place with popcorn and blankets. But somehow I knew that wouldn’t happen—that it would never happen. And I turned around to take a selfie—only this time, using *my* janky old phone—and snapped it.

The image came out dark.

As soon as my finger opened the picture, I became aware of the dreadful silence around me. No sound but the wind—a bitter chill gust that nearly blew me right off that ladder. The night was so dark that I could barely make out my own fingers, numbly gripping the rungs. My phone’s screen, the only source of light in the world, showed just me, looking a bit scared, my face pale in the flash against perfect pitch black.

There was nothing here. No one here.

Just the soft lapping sound of water from below the cold metal rim.

I turned on my phone’s flashlight. The metal rim beneath my fingers was less rim than… lid, I realized. There was a lid over the water, and a small hatch. A hatch I was about to drop through, before I took those pictures. Not a hot tub—a water tank. I shined the phone’s light into the darkness…

Through the gentle sloshing, pale skin drifted beneath the surface. Wide, unseeing eyes. Hair floating around the face like a halo of seaweed—

I screamed.

\*\*\*

When I tried to lead police back to Tai’s body in the rooftop water tank, I could find neither the apartment building nor the street it had been on. The selfie I’d taken showed nothing beyond my own pale face.

The pinned location I’d sent to family and friends led to nowhere.

And Tai’s phone, which I’d kept with me since making my gruesome discovery, had disappeared.

Police assumed I was making it all up. There are no apartment buildings in downtown with a water tank. In fact, the type of tank I described is rare at all in modern buildings, except perhaps overseas. It’s been two weeks now, and I keep scouring the news for anything about an unidentified body found in an apartment water tower, but Tai’s case is still unsolved…

\*\*\*

I did find one final clue. This morning, a package arrived. A fancy box with a shiny blue phone in it. It’s the phone that was *supposed* to have arrived for Tai weeks ago, and matches the order number of the email invoice.

So, this new phone? I guess it’s kind of like… Tai’s last gift to me. I already know how to use it because they chattered my ear off about it… and yeah it turns black and white at night because it’s smart and knows that it’s time for bed… I love you, Tai. Thanks for one final innovation to take me out of my comfort zone.

But I have to admit, I’ve kept my old janky phone, too. Because of the ghost texts. I still occasionally get them. Mostly not from Tai because it’s been so long. But I did get one recently that made me totally break down in tears:

TAI: Don’t worry, I’m fine. [I love you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
