It..? It? There is no ''it.'' It doesn't exist. It is nothing. Nothing is it. It is not a concept. It is not anything. There's no such thing as ''it.'' There is no one, there is nothing as it. It isn't a being. It is not.

It's been 3 weeks since I first saw it. It knocked on my door. Among the knocking I heard as if my girlfriend was telling me to open the door. But somehow, it also sounded like my dad. I opened. I saw it. It had a grinning smile stretching further beyond his face. It looked like a corpse. But alive. I couldn't tell if it was made of rotten meat or human flesh. It was looking at me. Its face kept changing. But always kept that smile on its face. It became many things. I saw the faces of my loved ones. I heard their voices. Whatever it is, it knows them. And it mimics them. It didn't hurt me. It just kept smiling over my head as I was crawling on the floor. I was literally shivering, I covered my face. When I looked up again, it was gone. I got up and called a friend. I ran out of the house with nothing but my keys. I drove to his house and I told him. He didn't believe it. He thought I was delusional, but he saw that I was afraid. He said I could spend the night when he realized I was scared for my life. I couldn't sleep. I didn't sleep. I just sat in bed and I looked at the doorway the whole night. I didn't see anything. I didn't hear anything. The sun came up.

I got out of bed. I went to the bathroom. I washed my face. I was still shaking. I was thinking. What the hell was that? What did I see? There was no explanation. Was it a ghost? Was it a demon? I heard my friend. He was calling me into his bedroom. His voice sounded strange. Like it was an automated message. But it had his voice. It was exactly the same as the night before, with the knocking. I could tell, that was not my friend. I still opened the bedroom door. I saw the same thing I had seen 12 hours ago. I ran outside. I ran all the way to his office. I asked for him. The lady at the front told me he called in sick. I asked if anything was weird about the phone call. Yes. She said it sounded unnatural. Was it like an automated message? Her eyes popped open when I asked her that. She said that's exactly how it was. I had never been more terrified my entire life. I went to a 24/7 diner. I was planning to sit there the whole night until one of the workers saw my sleep deprived shivering face and denied me service. They told me I needed to get out or they would call the police. They thought I was a junkie or something. I went to the hospital. I told someone at the front desk. They told me to wait in the waiting room. As I was waiting, I went to the bathroom. It was there. I got out of there. There was nowhere I could go. Wherever I was, it was there. I went home.

I looked all around my house. I couldn't find it. There were three new obituaries in the paper. Odd, since I lived in a small town. Long story short: three dead people, all left disfigured and hung from the ceiling. 1- My friend. 2- The receptionist at my friends office. 3- The front desk worker at the hospital. I put the paper down. It was in front of me. I looked at it. It looked at me. It didn't move. I didn't run. ''Are you enjoying this?'' It didn't speak. ''You killed them, why not me?'' Still nothing. ''What are you?'' It kept quiet. I didn't even know if it could speak. I was still terrified. Just looking at it made me feel chills down my spine, but I figured it would've killed me by now. I just looked at it. After a few seconds after that last question, its smile went away. It unhinged its jaw and yelled. I heard all my friends and family yell at me at the same time. All distorted. It kept yelling as I was covering my ears, getting louder and louder, then stopping. It was gone again. The doorbell ringed. It was police. They asked my some questions. About my friend. They told me they think its a cult or something. I didn't tell them. When I told people, they died.

The next day, I stayed home. I didn't want to leave. If it was gonna terrorize me, it can do so. But when I get out. I tell people. And it kills them. That's what it wants. That's why it won't kill me. It wants me to tell people about him. But I'm sure, when I'm not delivering, he's just going to kill me and go knock on someone else's door.

It's been 2 weeks. It appeared a few more times. I've seen it closely. I've studied it every time he came. Each time his smile had vanished a little more. I know its patience is running out. It's going to kill me soon.

That's why I'm typing this. If you're seeing this, it's coming. For you. Do exactly as I say. Go to your room. Lock and board the door. Turn off the lights. Destroy all mirrors and pictures. Destroy all electronics, anything with a screen. Do not look away from your phone. He will emerge if you do. Ignore all calls and texts. Once you're done reading this part, read the first paragraph. Then read it again. Read it over and over until you can memorize it. If you have completely memorized it, smash your phone and cover your eyes and ears. With no way of manifesting, it will come to you physically. Ignore all screams of your loved ones. Ignore them begging for you to come out. They're it. Ignore the thumping on your door and window. Sit on your bed and keep telling yourself. ''It'' doesn't exist. ''It'' is a myth. It is a hallucination. It is a scary fairytale made to scare children. It is fake. None of what you're seeing is real. YOU ARE DRUGGED. YOU ARE INSIDE A NIGHTMARE. YOU ARE IN A COMA. YOU ARE INSANE. NONE OF THIS IS REAL. IT DOESN'T EXIST. YOU WILL WAKE UP AT YOUR BED. YOU ARE IN A VIRTUAL REALITY. YOU ARE IN A SIMULATION. YOU ARE IMAGINING THINGS. IT ISN'T REAL. IT DOESN'T EXIST. THERE IS NOTHING AND NO ONE AROUND YOU. YOU ARE IN AN EMPTY ROOM.

And if your surroundings have been strangely quiet whilst reading that, I'm sorry. It's already inches away from your face. Don't look. It knows what you're doing. The second you stop reading, it will take you. I tried my best to save you. I'm truly sorry.
