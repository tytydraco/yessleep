"Stan! We are just going to the shops!" My Mom shouted up to me, "Come with, if you'd like!"

"No, I'm good Mom!" The four words I regret saying the most as I'm typing this. After a few more words shouted back and forth at each other she left the house and then text me saying

"I'll be back soon, Stanley, don't open the door to anyone other than me. Love you."

I smiled at her text replying with acknowledgement and a love you back. Afterwards, I continued playing on the PS4 with my dog, Max, next to me. All was good. No worries in my mind as I levelled up in my game of Call of Duty. I don't recall how long pat since she left, but it didn't feel like long until i heard my mom shout up at me 

"Stan, I got you some food, come down and let's eat!"

I wasn't sceptical, I did think it was my mom, but I checked the front driveway first to see if her car was there. It wasn't. I didn't panic, she probably just parked it round the back, I thought, it was my mom's voice after all. I made my way downstairs to greet my 'mother', but wasn't greeted with an open kitchen door, the light from the kitchen light seeping through the crack underneath the door. Instead, I was greeted with darkness. The kitchen door closed and no sight of my mom. I called out for her. "Mom??" 

"Hey sweetie!"  her face greeted me from around the corner, I'm guessing from the living room. Her face was contorted in a way I didn't even know possible. Unnaturally, her eyes widened as she smiled her toothy grin as if to welcome me. Her teeth were extremely white and precise, like she had dentures or Turkey Teeth in place of her normal, not perfect, but not awful teeth. Her awful smile that is forever etched into my mind, stood out from the darkness like a sore thumb. I immediately thought something was wrong with her and even thought of retreating to my room upstairs. But she just gestured in a demented way with her arm towards the living room as if inviting me to enter. So, reluctantly, I did. 

I sat down on my leather sofa perching the cushions behind me as my mother approached me with a basic meal of chicken and some lovely, homemade chips. I turned on the TV and watched what was on there as my attention was focused on my mother, not what I wanted to watch. Her smiled had dropped and she was now fixated on the Television. 

"Where's the shopping, mom?" I asked breaking the silence. I feared her answer, feeling like I had said something wrong.

"what" she replied coldly, not even acknowledging my question fully. "The food, the reason you actually left to begin with: remember?

"Oh yeah, I left it at the shop" She replied still glued to the TV.

"Mom, are you okay?" 

"Never been better why, Hun?" She asked with that same grin as before.

**\*Bing\***

My phone went off, notifying me of a new text. I waited a few moments before answering simply because my mom would ask who I am talking to. She's nosey like that.

"Hey, Stan, I am just going to a friend's to drop off something, I know I have been a while Hun, I'll be back soon"

My jaw dropped, literally. I started struggling to breathe my eyes puffing up looking around aimlessly for answers. My mom was right here, am I wrong? I looked at her hands and then her pockets in hopes to find her phone, just in case she texted the wrong person. But then I looked again, she said my name. Stan. She only could have been talking to me. 

"I-I need the toilet. Gonna be sick." The only shitty excuse I could come up with. I fumbled towards the toilet door, locking it behind me in a haste.

"Mom, you're joking right? You're sat right next to me." I sent to her. Her not responding within 20 seconds was enough to send me into a panic attack. I started pacing around this small toilet, reassuring myself with the worst of excuses, anything to make me feel comfortable and content.

The thing that made me the most anxious wasn't the fact I'd let a stranger inside, but the fact this thing sitting in my front room, this thing that just cooked me dinner, the thing that can talk exactly like my mom. Isn't human. The fact it can perfectly replicate voices, to the absolute T. Is already an eyebrow raiser but coupled with the fact it with no noise walked into my home and pretended it was my own mother made my fucking skin crawl.  

**\*Bing\***

A response I hoped. I grabbed my phone and typed in my password failing it multiple times due to my overwhelming feeling of absolute dread.

"Stan, you're scaring me, what is sat next to you?"

My panicked state rose even further I now started to actually be sick, the excuse coming to life it seemed. I finally opened the door, walking to get my skateboard and shoes. 

"Stan, where are you going dear?" it said. I ignored it and just walked outside. I didn't rush, I wasn't scared anymore. I just left to see my friend. I told him everything, I was shaking so much his parents actually considered ringing the hospital to explain my situation as they thought I was having a seizure or psychotic meltdown. 

About 3 days later, I built up the courage to go back home, when I did, I was greeted by mom, but the normal one this time. She looked very concerned and just asked me where I had been and why I ran away from her the other day. I explained what happened to her and even tried pulling up the messages for some extra proof. They were gone. Literally everything from that day was gone, including my Call of Duty progress. My mom explained to me what happened except I had the toothy grin and I also did everything my mom did to me that day. I was so confused. More than ever. I actually thought I was lucid dreaming. I even reality checked a few times.

I am still confused with what happened that day. And I post it here on Reddit for help as ever since then, my life has plummeted downhill, and I am even prescribed antipsychotics and have even been diagnosed with severe PTSD and Bipolar Disorder due to those events. Please help me
