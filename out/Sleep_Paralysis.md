Just recently I believe I experienced some form of sleep paralysis. Getting to the point, I was dozing off, not wanting to fall asleep but not really doing anything to stop it. I was dreaming about some shopping center or something like that, but it was like I was watching the dream through vr goggles. I realize I'm dreaming, and I'm like "oh, maybe it's like those dreams you can control." So, I say to myself, I'm dreaming. Apparently that is against the dreaming laws because I feel my physical body freeze. It's as if I can feel every muscle fiber and hair on my body. It quickly goes away and the setting changes, kind of like switching tv channels. Now I'm in some desert with a trucker dude, odd but not scary. I stupidly tell myself I'm dreaming again, and it happens again. I feel every little fiber in my body, I try to move but no matter what I just can't. The quality of the dream drops, some film draping over it, making it look just out of focus. Not only this, but it looks as if I'm watching something from lidar, the game where you use that little scan gun. The trucker guy stops, looking at me and slowly approaching my "screen." I say screen because that's the only way I can describe it, like some vr headset or a movie screen. Everything in the dream looks out of focus and really weird except for the trucker guy's face. As he gets close, everything goes black, and it's just his face in some weird inverted thermal colors. I don't get scared easily by this stuff, so I just wait for a bit while his lips move inaudibly until I wake up. 

This is the part that made me sh#t my pants. I wake up—or so I thought—because I open my eyes and feel my body freeze again. This time is different because this isn't a dream, at least I didn't think it was. I was in my bed, but my room was out of focus. Suddenly there is this noise, a mix between the minecraft screeching cave noise, a very bad violin, and the brakes on a high speed train. Then I see this face, staring at me. It wasn't traditional scary it was just so, unreal. There weren't many details, and it was like everything else in my room, out of focus. It was talking to me, yet I saw no mouth and I heard no words. It was how I imagined telepathy would be. I can't remember what it said, but I remember being freaked out. No matter where I looked, my eyes were forced back to it's face, my body feeling like dead weight. Even as I fully wake up, I stumble out of bed like the floor is moving. The only reason I am really spooked is because I couldn't find any sleep paralysis experiences similar to this. There was no crushing pressure in my chest, and I couldn't find any scenario where sleep paralysis was activated like some code word. I don't think I'll ever tell myself that I'm dreaming ever again.
