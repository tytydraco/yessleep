I’ve always hated Christmas Eve.

Not in the dramatic way people expect. I like the lights. I like the music. I like the way the world slows down for one night and pretends it knows how to be gentle.

What I hate is the feeling that comes with it.

The quiet.

Every year around this time, something in me hollows out. Friends drift. Texts go unanswered. Relationships stall for reasons no one can ever quite explain. Men tell me I’m distant. Hard to reach. Like I’m already halfway gone.

I never argue with them. I don’t know how to explain that I feel lonelier after being touched. That closeness makes something ache instead of easing it.

By December, I always end up alone. This year was no different.

I pulled into the driveway late, snow whispering against the tires. As I walked towards it the house glowed warm and full through the windows. Laughter inside. Smells of pine and cinnamon spilling out into the cold.

I should have gone inside.

The door was right there.

But I paused.

I don’t know why. I never do.

That was when I saw him leaning against the passenger side of my car.

Dark coat. Damp curls plastered to his temples. Snow gathered at his boots like it had chosen him. There was a faint metallic smell in the air around him, like rust or old coins.

“You’re late,” he said.

“I don’t know you.”

He smiled slowly. His eyes dropped to my hands, lingering on my ragged nails, bitten down to uneven stubs. Small. Human. Wrong in a way that tightened my throat.

“I know,” he said. “You never do.”

I should have gone inside.

I could have shut the door. Locked it. Screamed. Called someone.

But the light from the house felt distant. Unreal. Like safety belonged to someone else.

And beneath the fear, there was something worse.

Recognition.

I unlocked the car.

He slid into the passenger seat. Snow melted into the upholstery. When the door shut, the world narrowed. Wind fell away. The house blurred behind fogged glass.

Only us.

He leaned closer. His knee brushed mine.

My chest tightened. Every instinct told me to pull away.

“I don’t take what isn’t already there,” he said quietly. “I just make room.”

His hand slid along my side, tracing the hollow of my waist, then cupped my breast over my sweater. I gasped softly, heart hammering. Every rational thought, move away, lock the door, escape, faded under the weight of wanting and fear.

I knew I should push him off. I wanted to. And yet, I let it happen.

I leaned in.

My fingers brushed his arm almost of their own accord.

He pressed his lips to mine, lingering there.

I shivered, torn between panic and desire, trapped in the fogged reflection of the windows. Him, watching. Me, caught.

Without fully understanding why, I moved closer, following the pull I could neither name nor resist. The line between choice and inevitability blurred until I could only feel, not think.

His thumb stroked the fabric over my nipple, a slow, deliberate circle that sent a jolt through me, sharp and unwelcome and yet… not. He watched my face as he did it, his own expression unreadable, a study in calm observation. It was the lack of hunger that unnerved me most.

This wasn't a man driven by lust; it was something else, something colder, cataloging my reaction as if it were data. My breath hitched, a small, betraying sound in the quiet car. He leaned in, his lips finding the sensitive skin just below my ear. His breath was warm, a stark contrast to the chill still clinging to his coat.

“You see?” he whispered, the words a vibration against my pulse. “You remember this feeling.”

I didn’t. I couldn’t. But my body did.

My head tilted to the side, a silent invitation I never meant to give. His hand left my breast, traveled down my stomach, and settled on my thigh, heavy and possessive. The heat of it bled through my jeans, a brand. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to find the will to shove him away, to scream, to do anything. But my hands only clenched into fists in my lap, my knuckles white. I was a passenger in my own skin, and he was the one steering.

His hand slid up, closing over my most sensitive region and I moaned.

His lips closed on mine again, parted and I allowed him entrance. His tongue twined with mine as my breath came harshly. I wanted his attention but, at the same, didn’t.

When I finally pulled back, my breath came shallow and wrong.

“I should go inside,” I whispered.

He nodded.

“You’ll let me finish,” he said gently. “You always do.”

Inside, the warmth pressed in on me.

Everyone had gone to bed, the children dreaming of presents to be opened when the Sun returned. Stockings lined the mantle. The tree blinked softly. Pine and cinnamon filled the air. Everything looked exactly as it should.

I felt like I didn’t belong in it.

When I reached the bedroom, he was already there.

Sitting on the edge of the bed. Hands folded. Watching.

My heart stuttered.

I should have run. Slammed the door.

Instead, I stepped closer.

My body moved before my mind could argue. I didn’t even understand why my legs moved toward him, only that they did. My feet carried me across the floor almost on their own, drawn by some pull I couldn’t name.

Each step closer made my chest tighten, my fingers twitch. I hated that I wanted to move forward, hated that I was obeying a force I couldn’t see. I froze a foot away from the bed.

He didn’t move forward. He didn’t need to. I came to him.

Then he touched me. Slowly. Fingertips tracing the hollow of my collarbone, the dip of my waist, the curve of my hip.

I let it happen. I shouldn’t have.

My mind screamed. But every brush of his hand made me lean into him, betray myself. I hated that I did, and hated that I wanted to.

He leaned near my ear, lips brushing. Whispered my name. Whispered things I’d dreamed, phrases I didn’t remember knowing. Each touch, light but deliberate, burned a trail of fire through my skin. I wondered, over and over, why I allowed it, why I didn’t stop him.

He stood, his movements fluid and silent, and his hands came to my shoulders, turning me gently to face away from him. His fingers found the hem of my sweater and lifted it, the fabric whispering against my skin as he pulled it over my head. The cool air of the room kissed my back, and I shivered, not from cold but from the sheer intimacy of the act.

He unhooked my bra with a single, practiced flick of his fingers, and it fell away. His hands returned to my skin, flat against my stomach, pulling me back against him until I could feel the steady, unnerving rhythm of his heart through his coat. He was still fully dressed, a barrier of wool and cold between us, and the imbalance was dizzying.

He guided me down onto the bed, not with force, but with a pressure that was impossible to deny.

I lay on my back, watching the Christmas lights bleed colors across the ceiling.

He undressed me slowly, methodically, as if unwrapping a fragile, long-anticipated gift. Each piece of clothing removed was another layer of my defenses peeled away, leaving me bare and exposed to his unnervingly placid gaze.

When I was completely naked before him, he simply looked. His eyes swept over me, not with desire, but with a quiet, terrifying ownership. It was a look that said I have been here before. I know every inch of you.

Then he knelt, and his lips found the inside of my knee. A soft, warm press. Then another, an inch higher on my thigh. He was marking a path, a slow, deliberate ascent that made my muscles tremble.

My hands twisted in the duvet, my breath coming in shallow pants. This was not an attack. It was an unveiling. A ritual. When his mouth finally reached the place between my legs, it was not with hunger, but with a profound, reverent certainty.

His tongue moved against me, knowing exactly where to touch, exactly how to draw the response from my body that my mind was fighting to withhold. A wave of heat, sharp and undeniable, washed over me. A sound I didn’t recognize escaped my throat, a sob, a gasp, a surrender.

My back arched off the bed, my fingers digging deeper into the blankets. He held me there, at the edge of that precipice, his touch relentless and precise, until the world shattered into a thousand points of light. I came apart in his hands, a silent scream on my lips, the lights from the window blurring into streaks of color behind my tears.

He didn’t stop. He let the tremors run their course, his touch softening, soothing, until I was spent and trembling beneath him.

He moved over me then, his weight a familiar, oppressive comfort. He entered me with a slow, deep thrust that stole what little breath I had left. There was no rush, no frantic pace.

He moved inside me with a steady, unhurried rhythm, his gaze locked on mine, watching the last flickers of resistance die in my eyes.

Each stroke was a punctuation mark in a sentence I was only just beginning to understand.

You. Belong. To. Me.

And in the fogged reflection of the dark window, I saw it all. Me, beneath him. My legs wrapped around his waist. My face, a mask of agonized pleasure. And him, watching me, his expression unchanged, as he claimed me all over again.

When he emptied himself into me it somehow made me feel empty rather than full. Like a piece of me had been taken instead of his seed filling me. I cried silently, tears rolling down my cheeks at the enormous feeling of loss.

Afterward, he traced slow patterns along my skin, thoughtful. Almost tender.

“You wonder why you never stay in love,” he said.

My throat burned. “You don’t know that.”

“I do,” he said. “Because I take the part that lets you keep it.”

“What part?”

He smiled, and this time it wasn’t kind.

“The part that believes someone might stay.”

Then he was gone. He didn’t get out of the bed and dress. He simply was not there anymore.

I didn’t sleep.

Near dawn, I opened my phone. My hands shook as I scrolled through my photos.

At first, everything looked normal.

Holiday snapshots. Trees. Doorways. Snow.

Then I noticed the dates.

December 24.

December 24.

December 24.

Twelve photos.

One per year.

In every one, I was paused. Half-turned. Standing just outside warmth.

And beside me, in every image, was a blur. Not a person. Not a shadow. A distortion in the air, darker than night. Sometimes it pressed close enough to overlap my body. Sometimes it hovered just behind my shoulder.

Always present.

I swiped again.

These weren’t all of me.

Different houses. Different cars. Different women.

Same date.

Same blur.

Same pause.

Twelve women. Twelve years.

And in every photo, the women looked like me.

Not frightened.

Just… empty.

I understood then.

He doesn’t feed on bodies.

He feeds on absence.

He takes loneliness while it’s forming. Shapes it. Deepens it. Comes back every year to make sure it hasn’t healed.

We don’t remember him because remembering would let us fight it.

Instead, we wake up a little more hollow each year. Relationships fail. Friends drift. Love never quite sticks.

By the time we notice, there’s nothing left to protect.

I deleted the photos.

It didn’t matter.

It’s been another ten years and, with the help of years of therapy, I can finally remember. It doesn’t matter. He still comes every year.

He still takes his piece of me and I feel the loneliness embrace me like a cloak.

December 24, I’m alone again.

The house is warm. The lights are on. The door is right there.
