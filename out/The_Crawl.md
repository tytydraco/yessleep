I went to a strange summer camp as a child. I think something awful happened there.

I'm a college grad who moved back to my hometown. Recently, I got coffee with an old friend who I'l call S, paid for with the coupon perks graciously provided by my internship with the local historic society. We've been doing this recently, meeting downtown to catch up and swap stories about our childhoods here.

My main job consists of digitizing tapes from the town's archive and cataloguing them, cross-referencing with newspapers and local residents if they're still alive. Recently, I discovered a tape.

I've been trying to make a timeline of my own history here, too. School field trips. Bonfires. Swim lessons. It gets fuzzy around the edges every time I concentrate on any one memory for too long, like someone is gently sweeping the curtains closed. I do my best to give my full attention to S when she speaks, committing her words to memory. I can always write notes later. 

Sometimes I worry she thinks I started talking to her again just to get the answers I want. Granted, that is why I reached out to her in the first place, but it has also been a generally pleasant time, external circumstances and investigations aside.

So we sat, sipping our drinks. A lull in the conversation. Around us, a few other customers tapped on keyboards or chatted in small clusters. Finally, I asked,

"Do you remember summer camp?" 

Her eyes lit up at this. She took a long gulp of her latte before setting it down.

"Which part?"

"I don't know... all of it I guess." 

S squinted and looked down her nose at me, head tilted. She made that face at me a lot when we were kids. Usually when I was saying something sort of dumb or strange. Or when I was attempting to lie, which is admittedly not one of my strong suits.

"Did Graves put you up to this?"

"No." I hadn't even told my boss I'd been speaking to S recently. "I just wanted to..." Know what happened? Get answers? Too pushy. "reminisce." S raised an eyebrow, but seemed to accept this.

"Remember the Crawl?" S said, laughing. "That was hardcore."

I did. 

At Camp Gloaming, every camper was required to be a proficient swimmer before we could participate in any other lake activities. The Crawl was the ultimate test. It was a badge of honor and the source of my absolute dread. In the early hours of the morning, after the counselors herded us onto the docks in pods of five, we dove in. Our counselor assured us with a toothy grin he'd be on guard in case anything went wrong. This did little to assuage my anxiety. 

He blew the whistle, and the trial began.

I don't remember how far we swam. It felt like miles. It felt like forever.

I am not a strong swimmer even now. Back then, I was abysmal. No matter how many hours I put into practicing alongside my cabin-mates, they always seemed leagues ahead. At some point, I switched to the sidestroke, but even that became difficult to maintain as my arms grew steadily exhausted. I was sure that any minute now, my muscles would give out and I would sink like a stone.

When I thrust my head back to the shore, either to call for help or to orient myself, I found that I could not see the docks. I did see a distant stretch of sand, tinted gray in the soft morning light. It was deserted. 

I looked forward again and saw only the flat empty waters of Lake Abel stretching out into the fog, still and silent as ever. I couldn't see S or the other three kids on our team. Were they really so far ahead? I craned my neck, treading water, trying to spot the tops of heads bobbing in the distance. 

Nothing. Panic wrapped itself around me in thick coils. I was losing strength with every kick. If nothing else, I had to keep my mouth and nose above water.

Something closed around my left ankle. 

Its cold, firm grip held me in place like an anchor, yet it was strangely soft to the touch.

It felt like fingers.

As it pulled me under, I gulped in water without meaning to, cold and harsh against my throat.

And I was drowning.

For a terrible, endless moment, my world was going dark. A fuzzy blackness closed in on the edges of my vision. I wondered distantly if I was going to die here in silence, failing my swim exam.

I thrashed once, twice, until finally I kicked free. The fingers loosened their grip, though I felt nails biting into my skin hard enough to leave marks.

I rose to the surface, my lungs burning, my body full of icy water.

I remember screaming something. I think it might've been S's name. Either way, she was the one who I saw paddling back towards me from out of the fog. She was the one who scooped her hands under my arms, kicking her feet to hold us both aloft until I could take in deep breaths of air again.

Recounting this, S winced. "Damn. I totally forgot how traumatizing that was for you. I shouldn't have led with that one."

I said it was fine. Remembering was good. This was a good thing.

"Wait, what was the deal with you getting grabbed?" 

I froze. "Some kid playing a prank, probably."

"Oh my god yeah, I think it was that kid Cain. He was such a jerk back then."

That we could agree on. 

"Anyways, so I'm taking a gap year to focus on myself before I head to grad school. And you've got this whole archivist thing going? Look at us!" I could tell S wanted to change the subject so I obliged, nodding along and giving my usual spiel about the historic society. 

"It seems like you're really passionate about this project," she said. 

"I am," I found myself responding. To my surprise, I meant it. Ever since I unlocked that dusty storage closet in the back of the town hall offices and digitized the first tape, this job has felt more like an undertaking. It was work that needed doing. I hadn't considered until now that I truly enjoyed being the one to do it.

It's easier for me to talk with S than with other people. It's nice. For whatever reason, my mind feels quieter around her, more whole. I can almost imagine that we're back in school. For a moment, she's in her Golden Rams track uniform chatting away about her personal best and I'm in my old baggy sweatshirt and torn jeans, a sticker-plastered sketchbook on my lap, a silent demon on my shoulder, and nothing has changed.

I dreamed about the Crawl last night. I was treading water there in the middle of a vast, placid lake, struggling to breathe. There were many hands. Gripping my limbs like vises. Dragging me down until my lungs compacted. 

This time, S wasn't there.
