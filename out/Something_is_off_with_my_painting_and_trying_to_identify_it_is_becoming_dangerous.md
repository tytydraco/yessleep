Bright dawn light shone in through the cracked window, lighting up my tired face. I had fallen asleep at my desk, having lost the fight against deadlines. My new book was supposed to reach the editors by the next morning, and I wasn’t yet done with the ending.

I shuffled in my sleep and winced at the sunlight hitting my face. I jolted up and stared at the mess I was in.

"Fuck fuck fuck, no way. I can't finish this now. They'll sue me, I'll be behind bars!"

I had signed a trilogy deal with the publishers and my third book was long due. My books about goth horror were works of art, but now I was a slave of the corporate world.

I looked up at the painting over my desk. It was Lucifer with his hellhound, a perfect complement to my books.

But this time... something was off.

"What is wrong with this painting now? Did it rain? Did the fucking water seep in? Just drown me and kill me at this point."

Thud!

I spun around quickly to where the sound came from. One of my books had been knocked off the bedside table.

I got up and walked towards the book.

"You were one of my best, you know? I can't let you down. You deserve a banger of an ending. And I shall bring justice to that. A quick coffee and we'll get to kicking ass, alright?"

I placed the book back and walked out into the kitchen.

The sunny weather made me decide on a cold brew.

"No way it could have rained, what was off with that painting then?"

Bangggg!!

The windows flew open.

"Holy fuck man, damn."

I shut the window, picked up my cup, and walked back in.

I stood in front of my desk and let my eyes linger on the painting. Lucifer, in a magnificent suit, almost seductive, posing with his hellhound, Ramsey. Lucifer looked proud, but almost endearingly at his dog. Ramsey stood loyal to her master. But something was different.

"There is something missing my eye... the leash is just the same, his suit and shoes the same. Did the background colour change? Was it more red?"

Creeeeak...

The old cupboard opened slowly.

I jumped. The cup dropped from my hands.

"Is that someone in there?"

I grabbed the night lamp. "I'm not in the right mood, jerk! I'll bash your skull!" I yelled.

Cautiously, I walked over toward the cupboard, one step at a time. I jumped up in front of it, heart racing, expecting the worst.

Clothes.

Just my clothes. T-shirts, jeans, dresses. Just clothes.

I ruffled through them, hoping not to find anything odd.

Once convinced, I headed back to my table.

The spilled coffee stole more of my precious time.

I walked back to the kitchen to get the broom when I heard my neighbor's dog, Suzy, barking her tiny ass off.

"Would Ramsey be so cute and cuddly with Lucifer too?"

I tripped.

Thwack!!

I landed hard on the floor, having tripped over a stool that was not here before.

"Aaah, Jesus Christ! When did this get here? God, my leg! I'm already shitting myself over this book and now this? Imagine going to jail with a sprained leg! I'm so fucked."

I got up slowly and, with my courage of iron, managed to clean up and finally settle down at my seat.

I worked religiously on wrapping up my finale. It was dark when I finally raised my head.

"How do I end it now? I need the peace and calm washed off my readers' faces after the last line."

"Peace and calm washed off their faces... Terrified... Ramsey!"

As I looked up, I finally realized. The background colour was the same. Lucifer was perfect too. But Ramsey—the vicious dog, responsible for keeping the dead and damned in hell, away from the world of the living—looked different. Ramsey didn't look so ferocious anymore. She looked scared. Guilty. Sad for having disappointed her master. But she also looked terrified for what was about to come.

"How on earth did that happen now?"

And then I felt it.

A weight on the backrest of my chair, and then...

Cold hands around my neck.
