Here I was, sitting in the bus. Once full of people, now full of my imagination. I was staring out of the window and just thinking how things had changed and how I had come here. Once my imagination had been helping me, and now, it had come alive and had started forming things.

On every seat of the bus, there was this same girl. Short hair, Asian eyes, in a school dress, and with sharp teeth. She and her all shadows which were sitting on all the seats were just groaning and making other scary sounds. I was stuck between them. I was trying to ignore them. I started looking out of the window to avoid any eye contact with any of those entities.

Suddenly, I heard some metallic sound coming from above. I looked up. An Asian girl was on the ceiling upside down; she came crawling to me, making all the metallic sound and making scary faces. It all started when I was out of curiosity trying to do some experiments. I was in my hostel with my roommate sitting on the other side of the room.

“After the exam, it’s all boring, yaar,” he said.

“Well, yes. Nothing to study, nothing to prepare for. What to do now?”

“Shall we watch some movie?” He gave an idea.

“Yes, that’s right! What movie should we watch?”

“Something horror?”

“Well, well, someone wanna try to taste the fear.”

“Yeah yeah, let’s try.”

“Are you sure? I like horror movies, but you, my friend, are faint-hearted.”

“I will be fine.”

We started watching a horror movie. There were many gruesome scenes. I saw my roommate; he was closing his eyes in most of the parts of the movie. In the movie, they made some scenes where the actors were performing some rituals. I got interested in those scenes and after the movie, I tried to know about them all. Sitting in the dark, using candles, using salt, all these were common in all the rituals. I tried to perform the ritual which can make someone hallucinate for some period of time.

I gathered all the resources except the target’s DNA. I didn’t know whom to target. I walked in the corridor in search of something which can make me perform the ritual. I spent hours searching and at last, I found hair near the window. I collected the hair and returned to my room. I waited for my roommate to leave the room so that I can perform the ritual, for some light fun only. He left the room to meet someone.

I turned off the lights and sat on the floor, made the circle, triangles inside, and some sigils in them. Started chanting the mantras and waited for something to happen. Nothing happened. My door suddenly burst open. My roommate came in. He was shocked to see me like this. Sitting in the circle, surrounded by candles.

“What are you doing?” he asked with his eyes wide open.

“I was trying a ritual we saw in the movie.”

“And what ritual is this? Summoning devil? Mind control? Controlling something?”

“Well, just giving hallucination to the target.”

“And who is your target? Me?”

“Ahhh, no, yaar. Just some random person, whose hair I found outside.”

“Outside? You just collected someone’s hair and started doing this?”

“Umm... I know it is not correct. But this was just a random try. I knew this is just some prank stuff. This ritual doesn’t exist in the real world.”

“Are you sure that it is not real witchcraft?”

“I mean yeah, do you think I can hallucinate someone just by sitting in the circle? Kuch bhi yaar.”

“You know how witchcrafts work? There is some involvement of demons in them. The demons are being brought from hell to perform some activity that the person has been asking.”

“How do you know?”

“I have not completed my sentence. So, when you sat in the circle, lit up the candle, and started saying ‘LONSH COM SEL NITAB, FAM-GED ADOIAN,’ you basically asked a demon to enter the world and do your play.”

“Okay, but this is not a real spell, na. So, I guess, it’s fine.”

“Are you sure?”

“What do you mean?”

“Are you sure that your spell didn’t work?”

“I don’t think so.”

“Whose hair was that?”

“I don’t know. I found it in the corridor.”

“It was yours, Vidwan.”

“My hair?”

“Yes.”

“So, you are saying that I did this spell on me. But I am not hallucinating.”

“Are you sure? See the time, Vidwan. Do I ever come this early from dinner?”

I checked the time. It was just 15 minutes after he left for dinner. He usually takes around 45 minutes to return. This time, he came too early. I turned towards him. He wasn’t there. The door was locked too. Did I see a dream? I was confused. I erased the circle and all the symbols. I sat on my bed and started searching more about this spell and the sigils. It took me a few moments to realize that the spells and the sigils were real and not just something made for fun. ‘The Sigil of Morpheus’ was not just something one should use for fun. I started having a headache, I unlocked the door to let my roommate in and tried to sleep.

I opened my eyes. It was dark here. The lights were off. I used my mobile flashlight and saw my roommate in his bed, sleeping peacefully. I went out of the room for some fresh air. I sat near a window. I realized that the window was the same where I found the hair for the ritual. The breeze was cooling my face, and the starry night was making my mood better. I sat and was thinking how beautiful our nature is. Trees all green and full of fruits, flowers fully bloomed, and sweet scent in the air. I was enjoying the calmness.

Someone tapped on my shoulder.

“Abe yha kya kar rha?” A friend from the other room came to me. “What are you doing?”

“Just enjoying the nature. Happy breeze, green trees, starry night, and other things.”

“Nature? Why did you come in half asleep, buddy? Our hostel is in the better city, there are no trees, no fresh air, no starry night. The whole area is polluted with Carbon monoxide. Go in your room and sleep.”

He left me there. I looked out of the window, the starry night, trees, breeze all were gone. Concrete forest, CO in the air, and polluted clouds were in the sky.

“I might be dreaming again. I should go back to sleep.” I thought.

“YES, YOU SHOULD.” A voice echoed, in my head or in the whole corridor I didn’t know.

“Who is there?” There was silence. No one replied, no one was visible. Was I hallucinating? Maybe not. Maybe it was just because of my sleepy head. I went in my room and slept.

The next day, early in the morning, there was a lot of noise coming from the corridor, I went to check. Many of the students were leaving the hostel to visit their home for vacation. I was not allowed to visit home because of some reasons. I planned to study next semester’s syllabus in the vacation time. Very few of us were left in the hostel. We planned to stay till late at night and talk about a few things. There was a guy who was too sad as his roommate left and he felt alone.

“Are Surya bhai, he left today morning, na? Why to miss him right now. It’s not even 11 am here. Between at what time did he leave? I didn’t meet him.” I sat near Surya. His room is just in front of mine.

“Today? Dude, he left like 5 days ago. Just after our exam. And from then, I’m alone. That’s why I’m feeling lonely.”

“5 days ago? But I met him yesterday. He came to me while I was sitting at…..” I realized that what all I saw was just some kind of dream.

“Hein?”

“Never mind. Let’s meet at night.” Saying this, I left his room and came in mine.

“What all have I been dreaming? What is happening?” “Kyu ro rha h be?” My roommate looked at me with his small eyes; he was still sleeping.

“Why are you crying?”

“There is something wrong going on. I have been seeing things.” I tried to explain.

“Hmmm.. take this churan, this helps in sleep,” and he dozed off.

“Churan…. he didn’t even listen to what I am going through. Well, there should be some reversible spells too. I should search.” I started browsing and went on searching for hours. And at last, I came to the conclusion that the magic I did is irreversible. I closed my laptop and sat in shock. I was regretting performing that spell, magic without knowing the side effects, I was regretting for performing the magic using my hair unknowingly.

“There must be a way to stop this, there must be a point where all this stops. I should search for that. But, I have already gone searching for hours, where to check now? Shall I try to check the movie again?” I opened google and checked the whole script of the movie. Why waste 3 hours again when one could just go through the script. There were many stupid jokes, many hoaxes, and finally found the spell portion. The movie climax was that the person who was the target of magic died because of hallucination.

“So, this is how things gonna end?”

“YES, hihihihihihihihi.” A sound echoed. My door started banging.

“Who’s there?” I asked.

“It’s me, dude, open the door.” It was my roommate’s voice. I turned toward his bed. It was empty. The room light started flickering. I figured that I was in trouble. I looked here and there to check if his duplicate is still in the room. There was no one. I got off the bed to open the door. I heard a giggle. It was coming from my room. I wasn’t able to get the direction it was coming from. I looked up. Just above my bed on the ceiling, he was hanging on the wall with a wide smile on his face. His eyes were shining because of the bulb light, but it seemed that his pupils are pure white and he is some kind of evil.

The banging on the door became louder, and some more sounds started coming from the other side of the door. It was not him anymore. There was something that had him. I started praying. I closed my eyes and waited for some miracles to happen. Nothing happened, all the sounds continued. I stayed at my place and waited for the end. There was no ending. These sounds went on continuing. More sounds started appearing, scratching on walls, whispering, and many more. I gathered all my courage and opened my eyes. It was all quiet. No strange figure, no sound, nothing. My roommate was sleeping on his bed. I sat on my bed. I was all sweaty. I tried to sleep.

The next morning, I started seeing strange figures more frequently. Started feeling someone sitting over my shoulder.

“Or bhai? Wanna watch some movies?” My roommate asked.

“Sure. This time you choose a movie.” I replied. I was relieved that I am gonna get distracted by watching something light. My roommate won’t ever choose any horror movie, he is scared of them.

“So, what movie we gonna watch?” I asked.

“It’s a new horror movie.”

“HORROR?”

“Yes, you love those na. And also, you have been disturbed for a few days, so I thought that this might help you.”

“I don’t think it will be a good idea..”

“Are, don’t worry, I’m not gonna get scared this time. I am ready for it.”

We started watching the movie. It was about a girl who went on a picnic with his class. Her bus fell into a pit and they all died. Her ghost came back to the world to take revenge on the people who killed her by altering the braking system of her bus.

“Movie was good, what do you say?” my roommate asked. I was looking up. My eyes were filled with tears. I could see, the same girl, on my ceiling. She was smiling at me. Her eyes were red because of the blood, and her face was pale blue. She came down crawling on the wall. She came on the floor and started dancing. Her moves were scary, she was repeating the same steps again and again. It seemed her bones were all broken, bone-knuckling sound was coming again and again.

I grabbed my roommate’s hand.

“Bhai chal, we shouldn’t stay here any longer. We should run,” I said.

“Why? What happened?”

“This girl will kill us.”

“Girl?”

“She, she is dancing here. She gonna kill us.”

“But there is no one in this room. You should sleep now. I guess you are tired.”

“NO!” I fell on my knees. I was so scared that I couldn’t gather my senses and know that all this was some hallucination. I thought I am gonna die. My roommate ran to ask for help from wardens. All came to me. I was sitting on the floor. I had a weird smile on my face. Eyes were full of tears, and I was saying something. They didn’t tell me what exactly I was saying, but they sent me to the pandit. The pandit asked for all the problems I have, my roommate told him everything. I was still in shock. The pandit did some hawan and asked my roommate to do a few things that he followed properly. I was left with the pandit, he wanted me to stay till I recover, whatever I was going with.

I opened my eyes; I was tied to the chair. A few people were in front of me.

“What is your name?”

“Vidwan.”

“Are you sure?”

“Yes”

“Can you see that girl here?”

I looked everywhere, “No, what’s going on? Why am I tied? And where am I?”

“You were sent here by your college; they said you are suffering from some kind of possession. They say you see things.”

“Yes, I do.”

“Well, you won’t anymore. The spell has lost its effect on you. We did our work. Now you are free to go.”

I left the room. My roommate was there waiting for me. I came near him and hugged him.

“You saved me brother.”

“I had to.”

“Now, shall we go back?”

“Yes sure. We have to take the bus.”

We went to the bus stop and waited for the bus to arrive. We sat on the seats in the bus. I was happy that I am well and nothing bad gonna happen to me now. I was looking outside and was enjoying the view.

“Between, what girl did you see?” my roommate asked.

“The same girl from the movie.”

“That Asian one?”

“Yes.”

“Did she look like this?” he pointed towards the girl sitting next to our seat. She was the exact same girl. I realized that all the passengers in the bus have turned into the same girl.

“Hey, what happened?” my roommate asked.

“She is here,” saying I turned towards him. He was staring at me.

“Who?”

“The girl”

“Girl?”

“The Asian girl from the movie”

“Which girl? Which movie? Dude what are you talking about?”

“We watched a movie just yesterday. How can you forget?”

“Movie? Yesterday? You have been unconscious for the last 1 week. It was the bus accident. You were coming back from a date, and your bus fell into a pit, and all died except you. You were in the hospital since then. What are you saying about the movie?”

“Have we watched any movie where there were some spells were shown?”

“Yes that we did. 2 weeks ago, I think. And then you tried one of them.”

“Which one did I do?”

“I have no idea. I was out of the room when you did all this. When I came back, you were asleep, and there were circles on the floor. I realized what you did and erased everything.”

I looked at the window again. I started taking deep breaths. I realized the mistake I did. I turned towards the girl again. She slowly turned towards me. Her pale blue face had a very weird smile on it, and her eyes were looking at me. All the other passengers turned into the same girl. Short hair, Asian eyes, in a school dress, and with sharp teeth. She and her all shadows which were sitting on all the seats were just groaning and making other scary sounds. I was stuck between them. I was trying to ignore them. I started looking out of the window to avoid any eye contact with any of those entities. Suddenly, I heard some metallic sound coming from above. I looked up. An Asian girl was on the ceiling upside down; she came crawling to me, making all the metallic sound and making scary faces. She came closer to me and hissed. It was all the hallucination, but I got scared. Things like this started happening again. There was no way out. I figured. I got a lot scared and tried to jump out of the window. I was grabbed by the other passengers, I released myself from their grip and ran to the driver to ask him to stop. But, I saw the girl running behind me to kill me. I ran faster and fell on the driver. Our bus took several turns and fell. All of us were injured. An ambulance came, we all were admitted to the hospital. We got discharged. My parents came to take me home.

I knew she was waiting for me there too. I just sat silently in the car and was ready for everything.
