When I was a young infant, my mother claimed that my stepfather would lock the door behind him when taking me to bed. Usually, I would scream hysterically for a moment and my mother would bash on the door knowing something is going terribly wrong. After then the silence squeaks in, he would unlock the door and walk out, with his sick psycho mindset, he would have probably stared right into my mother's eyes while passing her. My mother claimed that he was busy giving me a blowjob...

I could not remember this part, but also, I was very young when this happened. What I could remember though was when I was about five years of age, he would force me to take off my clothes and demand that I touch myself in front of him, and when I was bathing, he would touch me himself.

My grandma and grandpa were suspecting child molestation evolving me and rushed to the child protective services to open up an incident report against my stepdad. But you see, this man is not like your everyday regular Joe, my stepfather is one of the cleverest demons I've ever met, a master manipulator, a psychological mind-controlling gaslighter, and in his ways very similar to something like an Epstein affect. it's quite unbelievable, but you know it's real because it looks so fake. Now, his sister works as an advocate at the children's court, and after she had heard rumors about my case of molestation, the accusations against her brother soon disappeared.

Years later, now in the present time, a lot has happened over the years. Last December (2021), I had a near-death experience when my stepdad tried to kill me next to the highway after I had caught him trying to rape a teen girl of my age (23), I almost lost my life that evening trying to protect her. You see, the only reason why he almost went through with the act was that I was isolated, everyone around me I banished out of my life, even my own mother. This was the perfect opportunity for him to take advantage.

I can feel a storm coming, it's roaring for quite some time now, thunder scratching in a distance. Nights have passed with plans and thoughts, most of the time around his life, and sometimes about taking mine. Justice is coming, I'm going to rip his soul, for what he had done to me, my brothers, my mother, and all the other women hiding in shame and fear who cross paths with my stepdad.

It's tough, with the situation in our country makes it even worse. South Africa is run by corruption and dictatorship, there is no more justice, we have rapists and murderers living high life, and the state is for the wicked. I work for security, mostly anti-poaching, and I have to tell you that it's so bad, for example, there was an incident of a guy who got stabbed to death by another man with nine (9) eye-witnesses surrounding the scene, the murderer didn't even see the outside of bars, not one night spent in jail, he's now roaming the street free willingly. 

Simple saying, give someone a knife and he could wipe a guy, but touch his mother, and he will extinguish every form of breathable life on this planet with pure hate, anger, and destruction.

This is my ongoing battle, he lurks in the shadows, but this creates opportunity to eliminate without notice.
