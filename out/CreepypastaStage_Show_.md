High School DxD: Stage Show|Poisonous Heart.

- Hello, my name is Damian. I am 21 years old and I am going to tell what I discovered in 2019. One day I was bored and decided to look for something to watch. I looked for anime summaries.

To find out what I dared to watch next, I watched a summary of an anime called High School DxD. It was a generic anime with an ecchi plot.

It seemed funny to me at first glance, so I decided to look for it on pirate pages:

“Issei, Akeno, Rias, Asia and all the others were my favorite characters. Xenovia was the one I liked the most.

In the months of 2019 I began to devour each chapter, OVA, special, even the light novels, which I ordered through Amazon.

 But On A Friday Afternoon Watching Anime Online, I Found A Page Named.

“Shadow Kuoh” When I Entered The Page It Was Yet Another Piracy Page, I Searched For Content About High School DxD.

It Had The Seasons, Specials, Light Novels In PDF.

But I Stopped At A Content Never Seen Before.

High School DxD: Stage Show|Poisonous Heart.

When I Entered, It Was Some Kind Of Series.

Name:High School DxD.

Category:Stage Show.

Broadcast Date:2009.

Synopsis;Something Changed In Kuoh's World. Now Rias And The Entire Occult Club Have To Survive Issei.

-
Survive Issei? Why? Is It Maybe A Translation Error Or Something Like That?

When I entered I looked at the chapters. There were only 3 adapted, they were like a kind of live action.

What the hell? A light series had a stage show? As far as I'm concerned, stage shows are public.

Because I was in a place so remote on a pirate page.

I remember seeing some stage shows in 2018.

"Super hero festival: Kamen Rider and super sentai" The point is that they were actors from series giving a performance, but this was something different.

A theater show of a story, without actors since High School DxD is a light novel that became an anime.

When I entered, I was greeted by an index. That performance only had 

3 episodes available.

First episode: Rias Gremory appears.

 Second Episode: The Nun

Third Episode: Confrontation

-

Episode 1:

I Thought It Was Unseen Material, I Took A Notebook And Made My Observations, To Upload Them To A Reddit Forum.

This Was What I Wrote Down.

It Started With A Theater Set, The Kuoh Academy. The View Was First Person, It Looked Like The Cameraman, Was Some Kind Of Hyoudou Issei.

I Entered The Set And There Were Actors, Who Looked Too Young To Be Adults, The Girls Awkwardly Grasped The Hem Of Their Skirts As If They Wanted To Make Them Lower.

In order to cover more of his legs and thighs, everyone looked at... How to say, everyone looked at the "Fake Issei" with fear and discomfort, the boys took hidden steps back.

And the girls wanted to cry, the camera recorded their thighs. It was no wonder that it was Hyoudou Issei's point of view.

It was disgusting, I could hear him salivating like a dog with a steak.

It continued like this for a few moments, until the actors of Matsuda and Motohama arrived, Issei's friends in the novel and anime.

But they were visibly uncomfortable with the fake Issei.

Motohama: Tell me Issei, what do you want to do?

Matsuda: Can we go play?

Issei: Really? We should spy on the girls.

 -

Later, the camera focused on Rias Gremory's thighs. She was seen talking to Akeno. I saw a detail that both Akeno and Rias wore.

Braces. That gave me a bad feeling. So I can deduce that everyone in that stage show is underage, except for the fake Issei.

It seemed that this whole play was written and starred by a sick person who got into the role of the "hero."

Akeno and Rias were visibly uncomfortable, trying to ignore the fake Issei. In an instant Rias wrote something on a napkin on a table.

She lightly wiped her lips, intentionally throwing the napkin in a spot where the camera could see it. It had Japanese kanji on it.

Which I took a picture of and with my Google translator I discovered something disturbing.

“Help us.”

I finished the first chapter of that play in such a disconcerting way.

Minors in a play, It is obvious that the only adult in that production was the “fake Issei.”

-

Episode 2: The nun.

After taking some time to breathe, I finally finished assimilating the shit I was seeing, I took a pen and continued writing.

-

It would start with a girl with blonde hair and nun clothes, I guess this would be "Asia Argento."

Issei: I see that you fell, can I help you?

I didn't notice it in chapter 1, but it seemed like the fake Issei tightened his voice to make it higher, and sounded youthful.

Which was obviously not successful, it was confirmed that he was an adult pretending to be a child in a sinister production.

They had the date like in the anime, at one point Issei started tickling Asia, which earned him some screams.

 "Leave my daughter" - Issei was seen looking outside the stage, I could see a father trying to enter the stage but stopped by 2 bodyguards.

-
It seemed that this episode lasted 40 minutes, and was adapting in a compressed way the Asia Argento arc.

Before joining the High School DxD team, but at the time of killing "Raynare." The fake Issei took a steel pipe and.

He hit it on the head of the girl, who played the fallen angel, the speakers that I had connected to my computer sounded loud.

The sound of metal hitting the skull, as when he dropped the pipe, that metal falling was heard, everyone on the stage began to scream.

I was left blank, while the screen of episode 2 ended, with the words "to be continued"

while in the background the screams of everyone could be heard.

Episode 3: Confrontation.

After dealing with the second chapter, I didn't know what to expect from this one.

I watched the murder of a girl and how it was written, by someone sick.

I took the time to vomit and quickly go back. As I started writing down the third chapter.

-

It seemed like an adaptation of Chapter 12 of the first season, in the fight between Issei vs Riser Phoenix

But now it seemed that Asia's father was forced to act as the enemy of the "Fake Issei"

The "boosted gear" didn't look like a prop, it looked like a steel gauntlet?

The fake Issei was literally hitting Riser with a steel gauntlet repainted red, trying to imitate his iconic weapon.

 As the fist hit the man, he cried and Issei laughed at him.

He coldly took out a Magnum and shot him in the brain, thus ending his life.

-

When the chapter ended, Issei gave the camera to Akeno. We could finally see the fake Issei with the entire cast on stage.

The appearance of the fake Issei, was a corpulent man of 1.90 height, wearing a balaclava.

All the actors and Issei bowed, Rias turned to the audience, all those present were the parents and relatives of the actors.

Who were brought to the Stage Show.

- When the chapter ended, I just turned off the computer and went to sleep.

The next day I went to that site again, the domain of the page changed now it was a motorcycle sales page.

End of story
