I have eczema, when I was a kid it was pretty bad but over the years its chilled out. Apart from like small bits of dry skin on my arms I'm basically completely fine. That was until recently when something.. Strange started happening? So basically I saw a small bump on my body, nothing crazy nothing weird. Probably a bug bite. The next day I woke up with several of the same bumps in the same area. All again looking like a bug bite. This did mildly concern me, but I can't really afford the doctor as I am currently a college student. Besides I didn't want to pay like a billion dollars just for them to tell me its my eczema acting up again. So I did what I do with all my problems and ignored it. As the weeks went by more and more bumps started appearing all over my skin. I remember one in particular was quite annoying as it was on my lower back and I would feel it sting everytime I leaned back on a chair. It actually got so bad I considered doing something I always fear to do when I'm in trouble.. I called my Mom. Who then proceeded to set me up a doctors appointment and pay for it with her "real adult job" money. 

When I was at the doctors office the dude asked me a bajillion questions, most of which consisted of things like "what are you allergic to", "do you have any pets", "have you been exposed to anything". I explained to him that I live in a college dorm so I can't have pets, and even if I could I'm not allergic enough to them to break out in anyway. The doctor then suggested I simply wash all my clothes and sheets and if the symptoms get worse fumigate the dorm room as my roommates might be at risk of getting bumps too. Obviously I was a little pissed there wasn't some cream or something that could just wash all my problems away over night. But in all honesty I was more pissed that I hadn't considered the idea of washing anything before going to the doctor. So I got home, cleaned everything, even made sure to clean my disgusting greasy gamer keyboard to be extra safe. Then went to bed.

The next morning I woke up with a shit ton more bumps. Instead of small patches on my arms, back, and legs. Now both my arms, legs, and back, were completely covered in the bumps. And anytime anything touched them it felt like pulling a tick off, after its been hooked on for a while. Luckily for me, my feet and hands were completely bump-less so I was able to yet again call my mom asking to see the doctor as soon as possible. This time she went with me to the doctors office as she was concerned for my safety. Not going to lie, I was pretty concerned to as the bumps started taking on the gross greasy quality pimples do. So not only was every inch of my arms, legs, and back now fucking disgusting, but due to my nervous sweats. My salty sweat mixed with the gross bumps greasiness which for some reason let off a smell that I'll describe as if someone forgot to eat leftover ham and threw it in a dumpster. 

When we got to see the doctor I was prescribed medication, and brand new eczema lotion. Which quoting the doctor was "Heavy duty steroid creme that should only be used in an emergency as if used often it can permanently damage your skin and lessen its ability to fight of disease". Now the only reason I remember him saying that is because at the time I thought to myself, "What in the actual fuck? How do you go from no medication. To the strongest medication possible? That my friend is unsafe". Which made me chuckle to myself. Anyway when I got back to my dorm I made sure to do a deep cleaning this time, ensuring no spot was left uncleaned before painfully sitting down and applying the lotion.

Now if this story hasn't already disgusted you enough I recommend you stop reading here. Because what happened next is so nasty.. That I sometimes gag when thinking about it.

The bumps started shooting out fucking puss the second the creme was spread on them. Like they were all shooting a gross tiny stream of puss out of each little top bump, then after about a second of squirting puss. THEY POPPED SENDING SMALL LITTLE CHUNKS OF SKIN, MEAT, BLOOD, AND PUSS ACROSS THE FUCKING ROOM. LEAVING TINY LITTLE HOLES IN MY SKIN WHERE THE BUMPS USED TO BE. And despite looking on in horror at the disgusting mess I would have to clean up. I still went on, I added the creme to both my arms and legs, and covered my back the best I could. I even used a mirror to make sure I got every part of my back. Then after all that shit was done. There I stood. Barefoot, in my now soaked with puss grease underwear. Covered in gross creme surrounded by little meatballs of my own flesh that them themselves were DRENCHED in puss. The floor was soaked in little puddles of puss, and small amounts of my blood covered the walls. 

I spent the next two days essentially sterilizing that fucking room. I threw away most things I had that got hit with the puss balls. Some of which were Carnage comics, a limited edition Shadow the Hedgehog Game Stop Funko Pop, and a Minecraft Lego Nether Fortress set. And now upon writing this I sit in a room that has literally never been cleaner. With tiny holes in my arms, legs, and back. To which I ask the question of. DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS HAPPENING TO ME?! I REFUSE TO GO TO THE DOCTOR AFTER THE CREME HE GAVE ME FUCKING BLEW CHUNKS OUT OF MY ARMS!!! DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY SORT OF ADVICE?! BECAUSE GOOD GOD THAT SHIT WAS DISGUSTING!!
