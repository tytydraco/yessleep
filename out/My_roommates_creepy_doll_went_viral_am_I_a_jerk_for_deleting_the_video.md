After footage of the doll walking through our apartment went viral, people responded with many sensible suggestions, which I wish I’d followed. Instead, I followed my housemate’s significantly *less* sensible suggestion that we continue to play “Doll in the Hall.” If you’ve never heard of this game (and why should you, given my housemate made it up?), it’s one in which you sew together a doll from socks and human (and hamster) hair and pretend it’s alive a la Elf on the Shelf until eventually, the doll actually *does* come to life—at which point if you’re still playing, *CoNgRaTuLaTiOnS!* You win a Darwin Award, since any possessed doll that actually comes to life is definitely going to remove you from the gene pool!

(In case you’re wondering, *yes,* at the end of the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11nz6qy/am_i_a_jerk_for_refusing_to_participate_in_my/), the doll did come to life. Because *of course it did.*)

So, you know, *great.*

But before we dive into this tragicomedy, *an important update!*

We found Binky, skittish and shaken but otherwise okay. So, for those of you whose greatest concern during the previous post was entirely for *the hamster* —rest easy, there’s no animal endangerment this time around. We sent her to stay with Karen’s sister. (Do I blame you for being more concerned for a hamster than for me and my fellow humans? No. No, I do not. On this you, I, and Karen are in complete agreement: no one had better mess with our little Binky boo!)

(Not to be confused with Karen’s *other* boo, the ragdoll of nightmares.)

Now.

Onto the Big Bad Boo.

**The Situation:**

It all started out like a wacky sitcom. Cue title credits for “Boo Boy and Me,” in which the possessed sock doll wanders around the house engaging in increasingly wacky hijinks, to which my housemate Karen is always oblivious, much to the exasperation of yours truly. “I swear, he really moved!” I say, mugging for the camera. \[insert laugh track\] These sorts of scenarios are so played out I can’t even watch them on television without groaning—thus I cannot even *begin* to express the frustration of having it play out IRL. I’d complain, “Just kill me now”—but that might be a little too apropos. Nor can I count how many times I lay on the couch with my arm flung dramatically over my face, wondering if I’d lost my marbles and pondering my options: contacting the Catholic church, prayer, exorcism, skipping town and joining a commune in the woods…

For example:

The morning after my previous post, I was just grabbing more granola from the pantry when motion in my periphery caught my eye—Boo Boy!

It came strolling casually out of Karen’s room.

“*Djjjbbbbth*!” I exclaimed as I dropped the granola and pointed, and Boo Boy froze.

Karen looked over and laughed. “Good one, Plato!”

\[insert laugh track\]

This went on for literally *days.* Then on Sunday, I was in the middle of cleaning dishes when Karen’s ear-splitting shriek launched me so high I practically grazed the ceiling. I dropped the plate into the sink and rushed into the living room.

Karen stood with her hands clapped to her mouth.

She pointed at Boo Boy, frozen in the middle of the floor mid-stride.

“He moved!” she squealed.

“Uh, *yeah*!” I burst. “That’s what I’ve been telling you. This thing is moving. It’s freaky as shit. We should probably destroy it.”

“No!” she squeaked, eyes wide. “He’s our baby!”

Our WHAT now?

She snatched up the doll.

“Excuse me?” I said. “This is *your* horror baby, not mine, I take no responsibility for—”

“It has your DNA!” At my blank (and growing horrified) stare, she added, “Your hair! And Binky’s! All three of us!”

“Um, okay, first, I’m not sharing maternity rights with a hamster. And secondly—*that thing is not a baby!*”

“Oh my God I have to catch it on video!”

“Karen do you not see how freaky this shit is—”

But she was already racing to get her phone. Cue interview of me, *again,* verifying what she just observed: Boo Boy, the monster lovechild of two humans and a hamster, strolling around our living room like some sort of discount Chuckie. I was doing dishes when it happened, so I still had my apron on and my best scowl. It was all very domestic. And all so very wrong. I was muttering about how I wish we’d just aborted my button-eyed co-star when Karen enthused, “We should set up cameras with motion sensors! You like science, right? Shouldn’t we science it?”

I *do* like science. But I also like being *alive*. And I especially *dis*like (I have just recently discovered) possessed dolls walking around my home.

“Didn’t you base Boo Boy on some Japanese game where the doll tries to kill you?” I snapped.

“Only if you stab it. You haven’t stabbed him, have you?” At my silence, she burst, “Wait, *you stabbed our baby*?”

“I mean, not *exactly*…” I guiltily explained about cutting its arm off and then sewing it back up.

“Oh. Well, I’m sure Boo Boy understands. Like, if he were to snip off your arm, he’d probably sew it back—”

“Karen—"

“I’m kidding! Besides, how is a doll going to harm you? He doesn’t even have fingers. He can’t hold anything!”

“Uh, he doesn’t have *muscles* in those little sock legs either, but seems to be ambulating pretty well.”

“C’mon, he hasn’t behaved in any bad way, has he?” She waved him at my face. “This could be huge! Actual evidence of supernatural phenomena! Like, you and I and Boo Boy could change the whole world! We’ll be famous *forever*! And if it gets dangerous, we’ll destroy the doll, I promise! Just three—no, *two* days! We just need video!”

In the end, I agreed to her request that we continue to allow Boo Boy to wander unrestricted around the house because—and hear me out here—I am an idiot.

**Boo Boy and Me:**

Before I explain how everything went predictably and horribly awry, a bit more on my motives and methodologies:

Once upon a time, I was contemplating a career in veterinary medicine. And before anyone questions why I made the incomprehensible decision to switch to philosophy—*no*, it’s not because I enjoy being poor. I’ve mentioned before, I think, my reaction to the sounds of animals yelping in pain? It’s why I noped out of that major and instead into one where I get to ponder such profound questions as, “What is pain?” “How intensely do animals feel pain?” “*Why* must animals feel pain?”… and many other mysteries of the universe I share with customers while also asking, “Would you like fries with that?” (In case you missed [Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11nz6qy/am_i_a_jerk_for_refusing_to_participate_in_my/), these jokes are an obligatory part of my philosophy degree…)

So anyway, based on my dubious credentials of having finished approximately one tenth of a zoology major, I decided to begin our scientific inquiry with the question:

Is the doll *moving* or *being moved*?—that is, is it *sentient*? Feeling? Reasoning? Before we rush too far along this track—whoa there, let’s not put Descartes before des-horse!

…

No?

Ok, well, moving on. I, a zoologist, know that even the lowliest lifeforms exhibit a reflexive response to pain. You or a fruit fly: yank off one of your limbs and you writhe. Boo Boy does not react to such stimuli, ergo, it is likely that Boo Boy is not of its own volition *moving*, but rather, *is being moved*. And the manipulating force is invisible to the naked eye and thus likely unobservable on the visible light spectrum (making the pet cams I purchased unlikely to capture evidence of it). But we could at least document its manifestation through its manipulation of Boo Boy and potentially other objects (it must have removed the ribbon from my lockbox, for example, and *unlocked* the box—something Boo Boy couldn’t have done from the inside).

I tried sharing my brilliant observations with Karen, but she said she’d leave the “nerd stuff” to me.

Anyway, since I still possessed some vestige of common sense, I told her that, “I’m removing all the knives, scissors, and sharp objects from the house.”

You know… *just in case.*

And now, with the cameras rolling, we recommenced “Doll in the Hall.”

For science!

**Capturing the Perfect Shot:**

Over the next couple days, Karen and I glimpsed Boo Boy ambling along in the corner of our eyes so often that it became almost… *normal*. We’d catch his diminutive figure trotting in our periphery and turn our heads just in time to see him freeze. It was like a kid playing red light green light, if the kid was a diminutive sack boy with mismatched button eyes. And yet, even though he seemed to be almost constantly in motion (I counted an average of four times an hour), the cameras never seemed to catch him. His movements were always too brief for the motion sensors. Or he moved just outside their range. Often overnight, the cameras got knocked over. One pet cam fell face-down recording the floor, another fell against the window and captured several riveting hours of the shadows of leaves… you get the idea.

I kept a log of Boo Boy’s activities. Most of his movements occurred in the living room, once in a while in the bedrooms or between rooms. Once, we found him in Curt’s room, hiding under the pillow. Karen amusingly scolded him like a small child and told him not to go in there again, “Or you’re grounded!”

\[insert laugh track\]

It was a very good thing Curt was out of town during our little “Boo Boy and Me” sitcom, because he likely would have flipped his lid. In fact it was imperative we wrap up filming before he returned. But when yesterday afternoon we surpassed the two day mark and no footage, by mutual consent, we continued the game.

And then—it happened!

Karen was on her phone late last night, doing one of her shoots in her room and talking about Binky (apparently her followers have been hankering for more hamster vids), when she glimpsed Boo Boy and swiveled. She actually videoed him walking *three whole steps*.

It was the perfect shot.

It immediately started to go viral.

You may have noticed, if you tried to search for the video, that it’s gone now. Almost as soon as it started racking up views, it got taken down, and she deleted her account.

Well. More specifically, *I* deleted her account. Because of what happened [next.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
