It was not over. My story goes on. The first part [in here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h8cl2g/the_silent_rescuer/), in case you have not read it.



I woke up somewhat later, probably two hours at most. The public transportation was still running. I was afraid to move, to preserve my straight, but my chances were pretty slim, as it all looked. I was not on a boulevard or anything like that. My best hope was to be taken by someone, anyone, and end up somewhere safe. It would not have been the first time I trembled on the idea of who my next owner shall be, although this would not be the first time. Now I was on my own, a lost object, unable to move, or choose for itself. Or could I use my emergency straight in trying to get some blood and try to live on my own, hunting? Both options felt terrifying to me. At first, the first seemed the easiest. But, as minutes passed and people and cars came on the street, waiting to be picked up, it felt heavier and heavier to bear and decided to open my eyes. 



The city was buzzing around me, although this was a pretty small street, with apartment blocks around it. I was in the space between the block and the sidewalk, a small green space, with grass, trees and small decorations. I looked up, towards the apartment I jumped from, it all seemed dark. I remembered Anais and gave a sob. If I were Human, an adult Human, perhaps I would have dared to go back, through the staircase and see what is in there. But now, I just sat and wished I was able to cry.



After a while, I decided to take my chance and stand up. It was pretty hard, as I lived under the constant fear of being drained and got into that state of being fully paralyzed I never, truly, experienced. Although I wanted to be found, I did not want to be seen moving. I had to be really careful. I checked the name of the street, as it was written on a plate, it was the Vlădeasa street. I went towards the main boulevard, behind parked cars. A teen girl passed next to me, she looked awkward at me, as I gave her a strange look. I was on my own, for sure, for the first time in my existence.



I ended up near a large boulevard, with lots of people and traffic. I could try something or play ”doll”. I decided to sit and get inert close to the corner of the boulevard, hoping that someone would pick me up. Attacking anyone at this point for blood would have been extremely dangerous, so I hoped someone may decide to pick an antique doll from the ground. I do not know how long it took, maybe hours. Several people were interested in me. Some teens picked me up from my legs, made some obscene jokes, then let me down. Other teens looked at me and kicked me. I hurt really bad, I felt like moaning, but I needed to keep quiet. I took some time to let the pain disappear. 



I think I went to sleep after this, I do not know how long it took, but I woke up pretty soon, but I avoided opening my eyes, in order to preserve strength. I heard a female voice asking someone: ”Hey, this is a very realistic doll. I wonder how she ended up here…” I dared to open my eyes a bit, not looking at her directly. She seemed like having around forty five years old, and her hair dyed dark blonde. A man with grey hair, wearing a green winter coat stood next to her. I managed to look to the left, I could see on the other side of the road a restaurant called ”Hanul Drumețului”, then I had to close my eyes.



”I think I shall take it home. Maria shall like so much…” she said. My heart jumped with joy, as it seemed I had found a new owner. The man answered: ”She already has so many toys…” ”No, this is a different thing. After a bit of washing and reconditioning, she will appreciate her more than any other dolls, this is a true work of art....” This lady was so sweet, I wanted to say: ”Thank you.”. The man answered: ”It is dirty and broken. Who knows where it came from and why it was dumped here?” They quarreled, as the woman held me of one of my arms. Not very comfortable, but it all looked really hopeful. The perspective of becoming again the favorite doll of a little girl and peacefully getting to sleep was really comforting. They kept arguing about whether to keep me or not.



But, as they were close to the entrance of an apartment block, the man spoke very firmly: ”Stop it, I am done with all. We do not have space for all the junk. Maria has a pile of toys, we need to stop. This thing does not come up, especially since it is so dirty!” The woman gave a sigh and, after a little hesitating, put me down, near a concrete lamppost. I could feel she really regretted it all, but at least she placed me sitting down, in a comfortable position, like I was on a nice, clean and decorated doll shelf. They entered the building.



It was raining again, a little windy. Trolleybuses still came and went, so it was not very late at night. Being there in that rain made me feel really miserable and hopeless. I felt almost completely drained by now, I knew I had to stay still to preserve energy. As people still passed next to me, I felt like using my last strength to attack someone for blood, in order to survive, but I knew this would end up really bad. I wanted to get to sleep, but I just could not.



It felt like one hour at least, although it may have been less, that someone became interested in me. I heard something like a sac almost filled being dumped next to me. A really smelly man took me up and started to study me. He felt really, really dirty, this was clearly a homeless man. I could also feel the alcohol in his breath. I had to withstand, without charging at him. Probably I would not have been able to get my fangs to his veins swiftly and efficiently, as I was. He turned heads down, looked under my dress (that felt really horrible), sideways, then he placed me on the ground, opened his black plastic sac and tossed me in.



Inside there were all sorts of scraps, old clothes, plastic bottles, metal pieces, it stenched, partially ripped off my dress, scratched my face. Perhaps I should have charged at him, after all, but now it was too late. He carried the sac for a few meters, then I heard the trolleybus stopping close by.



The man took the bus and took his sac with him. Being late, there were probably a few people. He tossed the sac on the floor and it seems he sat down. I heard the voice of a young man next to him, starting to argue with the homeless man, asking him to get off the bus. The homeless man, in a hoarse voice, refused. The young man got off pretty soon, and someone else took the bus and sat close to us.



As the bus went on, I tried my best to put myself to sleep, but I could not. I was getting more and more worried, soon all turning to desperation. This world was deeply hostile to me and to beings like me. At least if things were how they used to be decades ago, in the first years after I was turned. Almost everywhere around, there is *noise*. And this noise is not mere noise, but noise combined with something else, I could not describe what it was. I was used to it but now, in this state I was, it was irritating my mind, making things much worse. Soon, my capacity to handle it all decreased. My desperation melted with my decreasing capacity of handling the noise into something that festered, slowly, more and more from my mind. 



I could hear the noise or something from it affecting my thoughts, like it made me remember all the horrible things I ever experienced. It made me remember the night I was turned, how that man who turned me bribed my nanny, while I was in the Herăstrău park, to give me to him. I remembered how he brutalized me on the way to the location of his desire, in his car. I remembered that dark room, with a cable, metallic table on it, while I cried, sobbed and asked for mercy, but received none. I remembered seeing the woman who I later considered my second mother, being called by this man, to come and drink my blood. I remember when I first saw her, she looked dead, cold, ruthless and eager to drink my mortal life. My mortal body shook uncontrollably, my teeth chattering, as she came to me.



I remembered her sharp fangs biting my neck and my heart freezing in awe, as this happened. I remembered being injected with something that felt like burning poison, as she drank my blood. I remembered how death came over me, extinguishing the Human warmth and light in me, like a knife cut me from head to toes. I remembered becoming a creature of the night, a monster and how the left-over of my Humanity leaving me mourned in desperation. 



Then I remembered the years that came, when this man who now had control over me ordered me stay like a doll, alongside inanimate dolls, in a place he designed as a perfect image of an early XIXth century room from the a royal palace, like a decoration, upon his command that I could not disobey. I remembered the magic he forced upon me not to move, to be a doll, a doll with a soul, when only the woman who drank my blood, although cold as the grave, showed me attention, talked to me, teached me to read and hunt. I remembered how she quarreled with our master for me. 



Lastly, I remembered how I knew there was no one to save me, not back then, not now, not ever, nobody near, nobody afar. Nobody to be both capable and willing to. The noise tuned in with my thoughts, like speaking to them. I remembered God, I remembered when I was back in Scotland, in a Presbyterian church. I remembered touching a cross and feeling a sensation of being burned after I was turned. I did not dare to look with my mind upwards, towards Heaven.



The *noise* itself was talking to me, in my thoughts, about all those, making me remember all more clearly. All that *humming* started to make one unified point near to me. And the *point* was like *saying something silently* to me. Something that felt more true as time passed, something that made me tremble worse than the state I was in. There was *someone* clearly present next to me, someone terrible who *spoke silently* that they are there to *rescue* me, that I have to accept that, as nobody is this world or the one above shall save me now. The dark memories started to blur into something like a dark, toxic smoke, making them *sharper*.



The presence felt stronger and stronger and I realized it was the *Silent Rescuer* who rescued Anais and her family and I knew the presence came to me and shall ”rescue” me if I do not reject this strong enough. I wanted to desperately scream: ”I do not want to be rescued!” and looked with my mind for anybody or anything at all, somebody to care for me or somebody who did not care for me but, somehow, for one reason or the other, stop all this. Something in my soul *opened up* for this with a huge thirst. Then, as my mind was getting ready to fall, I heard the bus stopping and the person next to me getting off the bus and the *presence* drifting away, with that person.



How shall I express it all? I felt almost *happy*. I was at the brink of collapse, but almost happy. I could not move, my energy was close to zero, but at least that thing was no longer close. Or, at least, I did not feel it anymore. I could not understand why the homeless man or anybody on the bus, if there was anybody at all, did not react to the presence. Were they affected by the presence? At least the driver seemed unaffected. Then, a thought crawled into my mind: ”How do I know this bus still has a Human driver and who knows what is driving it? Or perhaps something even stranger?



The grinding of my mind continued, fueled by the memory of the presence early on, in the darkness and stench. I might have gone to sleep, not sure, but I was sure awake at the end, when the bus stopped and I heard someone who was most likely, the bus driver, kicking the homeless man and shouting: ”Baicului! End of the line!” The homeless man said something unintelligible, like awakened from slumber, got up, put the sac with me in it and went down from the bus. It has already been a while since I was unable to open my eyes. I heard the sound of a train moving slowly, a railway was close.



He dragged it a few meters away and was greeted by some other man. My capturer asked the other man to give him a bottle of alcohol, the other refused, they started to argue. After a while, it seems the capturer decided to open up the sac and offer some things to the other in exchange for alcohol. I was brought along among other things. I remember the second man said some harsh words, some of them unknown to me, as I did not know Romanian too well. It went something like this:



”You are dumb! You fill your sac with crap, instead of taking useful things!” ”No, this could have been sold to the merchant from…” He was interrupted:” You're even dumber than I thought you were. No way you could sell that worthless trap. Look at it (He touched my face with dirty, abrasive hands.) this plastic is so bad, I could break it in an instant! (My mind gave a sigh, as I realized that I was in the hands not just of someone who could not appreciate the value of a porcelain doll, but someone who only knew of cheap plastic toys and thought I was made of such cheap plastic… For a second, I  regretted that the Rescuer did not get me…) I'll tell you what. I made a fire nearby, on the back alley of that block, the folks living there are ok with me doing that, even the Local Police lets me. Give me this crap, alongside that old coat on the bottom of the sac and I shall use them to fuel the fire. Plastic burns nasty, but it gives away nice heat and I shall give you this bottle of booze. I have in this small bottle a little accelerant; I shall put it on this thing, to burn better and stronger.”



”Done!” My capturer said and handled me to the other man. As a cold chill touched my heart, I now had the value of a cheap booze bottle, as I felt a crushing bitterness. I regretted again that the Rescuer did not get me. No, that would have been horrible, perhaps this, after an intense suffering that shall take an hour the least I shall be gone. And then what? Would my soul be free? Will I go to Heaven? If Heaven and Hell are out there, it would make sense I was destined to Hell and the fire in here would be a foretaste of the hellfire to come. All I could do was struggle silently and in stillness, since I could not fight anymore, until I got truly drained, got unconscious and did not feel the fire. It would not matter if they find, hours later, the scraps, some bones that seemed to be the bones of a child. I would be gone by then.



I cried my heart out for someone to help me, as I tried to destroy what remained of my consciousness and the heat of the fire started to be felt. Soon, it will be over in a terrible way. Perhaps the intense pain of the beginning of the fire shall finally drain me. The man threw me to the ground and I heard the sound of a bottle. He started to sprinkle me with some liquid, it was that accelerator stuff he talked about. It smelled really pungent, chemical. Then he grabbed me by one of my legs and came close to the fire. The heat was strong and I was sure it was only a matter of seconds before the fiery demise shall start. My soul desperately wanted to be able, at least *to beg*, to be capable of begging and to have to *whom* to beg, but only void was in my soul. Yet, as my soul contemplated that void and already started to feel, in anticipation, how shall it be when I will be burned alive, and it did not realize *it still hoped that someone heard its cry*, as the man already did the movement of his arm to throw me in the fire.



Just as this was less than a second of happening, I heard a masculine voice pretty close shouting at the homeless man: ”Hey, you! What is that you have there?” The homeless man stopped, let me down so that my head touched the ground, without dropping me and answered in a stumbling and meek tone: ”Nothing, sir, just some old crap I want to burn, in order to be warm tonight. Please, I do not want to do anything bad, just to keep warm…” The other man replied, as he came closer: ”Where did you get that from?”



”Just some pal of mine gave it to me, he did not tell me where he got it from. Now, I shall toss it into the fire.” he gave a hasty reply and got ready to throw me once again into the fire, perhaps to escape the scrutiny, as my soul shivered and shrank one again. ”Not until I see it. If it is worth something, I shall give you something for it.” The homeless man stopped and grabbed my neck and pulled me, to show me, as I felt the immense sweetness of faint hope.



I heard footsteps coming towards me, this man came to us, but he did not seem to be alone. I felt him coming close to me, breathing close and saying: ”Hmm… This is in a really bad state. I do not think it is worth the hassle to get it, the restoration shall be really expensive.” Then I heard the intrigued voice of a woman: ”Let me see it too, please.” She came closer and touched me with her finger on my face, for a few seconds. Her warm and lively touch felt like a drop of dew. She said: ”I want to get this. I mean it.” The man along with her replied: ”Come on, it is not worth it. Trust me, I am pretty experienced in buying and selling antiquities to  realize it is not worth it.”



She insisted pretty firmly: ”No, you trust me on this. I want to get this.” Then she asked the homeless man: ”How much do you ask for this?” He answered: ”50 lei.” (Lei is Romanian currency, 5 lei is worth about one euro or one dollar.) ”Ok, it's a deal.” Now, if I could, I would have jumped out of joy and hugged her, as she went through her purse. ”Screw it, I only have a 100 lei bill. Do you have 50 lei in cash?” asked the man alongside her. ”No, let go of this stupidity. I would not give 10 lei on this.” ”Ok then, I shall give him 100 lei for her. Trust me on this, I know what I know.” The man alongside her got a bit angry: ”What?” ”No, as I said, trust me on this.” She gave the homeless man the bill and he gave me to her.



She held in her arms, examining me. It was so wonderful, almost ecstatic. I did not know much, who she was, why she took me in, but I felt I *loved* her. I felt like kissing her right hand and anointing it with my tears. ”Now,” she said, let's take her to the car. They went towards their car. The man opened the trunk, but the woman said: ”No, place her on the back seat.” ”Are you mad? It shall ruin the back seat and that dirt and chemicals.” ”As I said, trust me on this and do as I say.” she replied calmly. ”Ok, then, let me place that blanket before.”



He placed the blanket, then the woman placed me sitting on the backseat and placed the seat belt on me, like on a person. ”Ok now, she said, let's go to that non-stop supermarket on the Pantelimon highway, close, to get some coffee. I shall need it.” ”There is no non-stop supermarket nearby.” ”Yes there is, I know it for sure.” She placed me comfortably and locked the car.



I finally let myself drift to sleep. I did not know if I would ever wake up, but it felt peaceful. At least, if this is the end of my conscious life, it shall be a sweet one. But it felt like it was not over by far. I had a beautiful dream, me and my mom in darkness were for a walk, like decades ago, showing me around and how to hunt. I woke up to the sound of a car opening. It took some seconds to remember it all. It could have been hours, days, years, I had no idea how much I slept. I heard the man and the woman talking to each other, so it was hours at most.



They started the car and played some music, as they chattered. It seems that we crossed a railway track soon: They played some strange folk music, they noted that it sounded pretty good, but that it was made by AI. I had no idea what I was at that moment. I was getting positively suspicious of all of this, I suspected they knew something about me, or at least the lady knew. Things looked really hopeful for me, since I went to sleep, then awoke soon. I could not open my eyes or move, but I was pretty conscious, calm and the woman seemed to treat me pretty well. She could have tossed me in the trunk, but she did not, she placed me on the back seat and secured me with a seat belt, like you do to a real person, not a doll.



In less than one half an hour, we stopped. They seemed pretty quiet in stopping the car and getting down. The lady came to me, checked upon me. ”Could this be…” I thought to myself. 

Weirdly, I felt something familiar, something I felt decades ago. Faint at first, then stronger. I think they were only a few minutes of me being alone in the car when I heard footsteps. The lady came to me, took me gently in her arms and brought me out. Yes, for sure, I felt it pretty clear that someone like me was nearby, at hand. A few moments of silence, the lady passed me to someone else, who now held me. I loved it. I was almost sure by now. Then, this new person spoke, with a very gentle, yet very loving and very concerned tone: ”Alice, can you hear me?” Yes, it was *her*. My Vampire mother, the one and only  [Helena the Clown](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helena_The_Doll_Clown/comments/w836zg/helena_the_clown_episode_list/) .



I wanted to answer, I wanted to shout, to embrace her, to cuddle in her arms… But I could not, as I was nearly completely drained, all I could manage was to tremble. She said: ”Quickly, let's get her inside. We need to act fast! We do not have much time!” All three of them went inside, I did not know where, but the place felt eerily familiar. Helena said to them: ”You told me you felt like waking me a week ago, as you were supposed to let me sleep until a few days before Christmas. I think this was the reason. Such a good moment, the donations were pretty hefty”,



I heard some plastic moving, Helena sat down and placed in the setting position. After all this time, I do not know how long, she still knew me, she knew how I worked, what my needs were… It felt unreal… She did something with a plastic bag, then she titled my head and tried to open my mouth. I could not cooperate, as I was, basically, paralyzed. She placed something on my mouth, it was a plastic bag containing Human blood. It was cold, but viable, I could not explain why (I had no idea how donated blood is stored back then.), I desperately wanted to drink it all, but I was in such a bad state I could not move one millimeter. 



Helena said worriedly: ”No, sister, do not give up on me! Not now!” She removed the blood, gave a very concerned sigh on a tone I never ever heard her to have and, after a few more seconds of silence, she said: ”This needs to be done. I see no other way. I hope this is not too late.” The woman who brought me in said: ”What do you need? Can I help?” ”Well, ” Helena answered hastily, ”some tissues from the drawer, not much, I think I can take care of myself. I shall drink this bag myself now, as I am going to need it.” Then she turned towards me: ”Sister, please, hold on just a little longer, please?... I think I know what to do.” I heard her drink the blood herself, what was she thinking?



I heard her working on the neckline of her dress, near the left breast. It seemed she exposed a large part of the breast, then she did something. I heard a pinch then smelled the *Vampire blood* flowing out of her breast. She handled me, placing my slightly opened mouth to the open wound she just inflicted upon herself. Fresh drops of blood went through my lips. Slowly, a new fire of life entered my body through her blood. My body trembled, as it got something Human blood could not give me. It was pretty harsh in its own way, as life came to me, but it was lovely. And, for the first time in so much time, I felt *loved*. I wish this never stopped. Finally, I got so much that I was able to move my mouth and attach to the wound. Helena said gently: ”Do not worry, little one. Drink, you need it.”



Slowly, but surely, my strength came back to me, coming into every distant corner of my body. I started to move my eyelids, my fingers, then my hands, my feet and, in no time, I felt able to move my whole body. I stopped drinking, letting my head drift away. Helena took her hand, placed it to her breast and did something (She has many powers I lack.) to close her wound.



I opened my eyes and saw her, I just knew her. Her dead, white eyes, her corpse face, with Clown coloring on it, her dark, wiry hair, even her clothes seemed the same as I knew her. Yet, something was strikingly different. In the past, she was pretty distant and harsh, even when she was there for me. But not now, no way. This monster woman, this fearsome witch the whole city feared back then was now *warm*. Warm, gentle and *loving*, like a living, Human mother or, perhaps, even more than this. And then something I would not have conceived her to be capable of, something I never considered any Vampire capable of, she *cried*. She cried and smiled at me, making me cry and smile myself. I jumped and gave a huge hug, placing my face next to hers and she caressed my back as I did that. Now I knew what it meant to be, truly, *happy*.



After  a pretty long time, we parted from the embrace and, looking at me, finally said:  ”We have a lot of catching up to do. But now rest, you are in my hands now.” I cuddled there, like a baby. She looked at the two who brought me in, and I looked at them as well. The lady was a tall blonde woman, wearing a fancy black coat. She cried as well and felt filled with joy looking at us. The man was a thin, abashed young gentleman, with thick glasses and a brown coat, looking a bit confused about all this.



”They are Ruxandra and Adrian.” Helena continued. ”They found you, it felt unreal when Ruxandra called me, but I urged them to get you to me. You owe your life to them.” I did not know what to say, I looked at them, as I remained cuddled in her arms. Ruxandra said, still crying a bit: ”You, I know Helena so well, she told me so much then, when I saw you, I felt something similar to her own presence, so I went straight to you. And, when I touched you, I had no doubt.” I did not know what to say. I looked at them, then looked at Helena. Yes, I knew then, somebody heard my silent cries and *rescued* me. Someone I didn't know yet, but whom I felt to be so real at that moment, but not like the terrible memory of the *presence* that took Anais.



I looked at Ruxandra and Adrian, especially at Ruxandra and I was able to whisper: ”Thank you.” Then I turned to Helena, kissed her on the cheek, then placed my head on her breast and closed my eyes, in *happiness*.



I think I shall put an end to my tale for now, as I am pretty new to all this and much is yet to come. Helena taught me a lot, including how to type on a laptop, she helped me formulate it all, to write it, but she insisted on typing it myself and posting it in here.  There is more to tell.



I blow you a kiss,



Alice
