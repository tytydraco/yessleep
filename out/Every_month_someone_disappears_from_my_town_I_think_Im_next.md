My name’s Emily, I’m 19, and I live in a town called Whitlow Hollow. You won’t find it on Google Maps. I’m serious. You can search for it, try GPS, whatever—but the roads will glitch out, and it’ll act like we don’t exist. That’s not a metaphor. It’s just one of the many things that stopped making sense a long time ago.

I used to think that was just a weird tech issue. Now I think it’s part of something bigger. Something that wants us isolated. Hidden.

People go missing here. One person, every month. Always around the same time—between midnight and 3 a.m. on the 13th. It’s been happening for years. Some folks say it started in the 80s, others claim it goes back further, but it really picked up the year I turned thirteen. That’s when my friend Lily vanished.

We were in seventh grade. She walked home after a sleepover at my place, just a few blocks away. She never made it back. At first, they thought it was a kidnapping. Search parties, dogs, the works. But after a week, everything just… stopped. The flyers came down. Her parents stopped talking to anyone. Like they knew something but couldn’t say it.

After that, it became a pattern.

Once a month. Always someone alone. No signs of struggle. No noise. Just gone.

We had a town meeting last year. It was the first time anyone tried to talk about it publicly. Mayor Jensen started to say something—about "traditions" and "old agreements"—but then his nose started bleeding. Bad. He collapsed in front of everyone. By the time the ambulance arrived, his mouth was full of dirt.

Dirt. Packed in like cement. I saw it.

They said it was a stroke.

No one tried to talk about it again.

A few of us started keeping track. Me, Noah (my best friend since kindergarten), and Kara, who works at the gas station. We created a spreadsheet, tried to find connections. We looked at weather patterns, birthdates, anything. But the only constant was the date: the 13th. Every single month.

Last month, Kara was taken.

Noah and I were supposed to check on her that morning. She hadn’t responded to texts, which wasn’t like her. We found the back door wide open and the lights still on. Her phone was on the kitchen table, unlocked. One text, half-written: “It’s at the window.”

That night, Noah begged me to leave town with him. He was terrified. Said we were running out of time. I wanted to go, I really did—but something in me… I don’t know. Froze? Pulled me back?

He left the next morning.

Now it’s just me.

Tonight is April 12th.

I’ve locked all the doors and boarded the windows. I’ve sprinkled salt across the thresholds. I don’t even know if that does anything—it’s just something I read online. The power’s been flickering since sundown. My phone has no service, and the Wi-Fi went out an hour ago. The whole town is quiet.

Too quiet.

There’s this sound that comes the night before someone disappears. It’s hard to describe—it’s not a scream or a howl. It’s low, vibrating, like a growl echoing from under the ground. I first heard it the night Lily vanished. I’ve heard it every month since.

I just heard it again. Ten minutes ago. It rattled the windowpanes.

It knows I’m alone.

There are rules to this thing—whatever it is. It doesn’t come for you if you’re not alone. It doesn’t come if you leave town. But if you’re here, and by yourself on the 13th… you’re fair game.

I used to think it was random. Now I think it’s choosing. Watching. I think it knows things about us that we don’t even know about ourselves.

It’s 11:51 PM now.

The house feels… wrong. The shadows aren’t staying where they should. I lit every candle I could find, but the flames keep dimming every time I look away.

Something just knocked on the front door.

Three slow knocks. Then silence.

It’s not Noah. He wouldn’t knock.

I’m not opening it. I won’t.

I’m writing this in my notes app in case I don’t make it. If someone finds my phone, if this uploads to the cloud or gets posted somehow—please, believe me.

There’s something in Whitlow Hollow. It’s old. Hungry. And it’s taking us, one by one.

I think I’m next.

It’s 12:04 AM.

It’s inside the house.
