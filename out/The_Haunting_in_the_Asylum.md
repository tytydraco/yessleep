Greetings, fellow seekers of the unknown. My name is Mark, a pseudonym I use out of necessity, for what I am about to recount may indeed shake the very core of your understanding of reality. It is a tale steeped in horror, madness, and a slow descent into the abyss of the human psyche. This is my story, a chronicle of the haunting of the Asylum, and the terror that still claws at the fringes of my mind.

The journey began under the auspices of a seemingly mundane assignment. As a freelance photographer, I was commissioned by a local magazine to capture the desolate beauty of abandoned structures for their Halloween issue. Hollow Creek Asylum, shuttered and decaying, was to be my subject. Little did I know, it would also become my tormentor.

The asylum stood alone in the wilderness, a crumbling edifice of Gothic architecture, its spires piercing the gray sky like skeletal fingers. The atmosphere was oppressive, the air thick with the scent of rot and decay. As I crossed the threshold, an icy chill enveloped me, as if the building itself were exhaling its malevolence. The entrance hall was vast and echoing, every step I took reverberating through the empty corridors, an unwelcome intrusion in a place long forgotten by the living.

I began my work, the click of my camera shutter the only sound in the suffocating silence. Dust motes danced in the thin beams of light that pierced the boarded windows, illuminating the remnants of a bygone era. My lens captured the peeling paint, the rusting gurneys, the forlorn wheelchairs, each frame a testament to the suffering that had once permeated these walls.

It was when I ventured into the basement that the true nature of Hollow Creek began to reveal itself. The stairwell descended into darkness, the air growing colder with each step. The flashlight in my hand cut through the inky blackness, revealing rows of rusting metal beds, each one fitted with restraints. The sight was enough to unsettle the bravest of souls, but I pressed on, driven by a morbid curiosity.

At the far end of the basement, hidden behind a false wall, I discovered a door. It was heavy, reinforced with steel, and covered in strange, arcane symbols that seemed to writhe and shift under the beam of my flashlight. With great effort, I pried it open. The room beyond was small, and the stench of decay was overwhelming. Chains hung from the ceiling, and the floor was stained with the dark, congealed remnants of blood.

In the center of the room was an operating table, encrusted with dried blood and surrounded by grotesque surgical instruments. As I approached, a glint of metal on the floor caught my eye. I picked it up, a small, ornate key. The moment it touched my skin, a searing pain shot through my skull, and I was plunged into a vision of unspeakable horror.

I saw doctors and nurses, their faces twisted in sadistic glee, performing macabre experiments on helpless patients. They cut and sliced with gleeful abandon, the screams of their victims filling the air. Standing in the corner, shrouded in darkness, was a figure whose presence exuded pure evil. Its eyes, twin pools of malevolence, locked onto mine, and I felt my sanity begin to unravel.

The vision dissipated, leaving me gasping for breath on the cold, stone floor. I wanted to flee, but a sinister compulsion rooted me in place. Pocketing the key, I continued my photographic exploration, though each snap of the shutter felt like a tolling bell, counting down the moments until my doom.

Returning to the main floor, I began to hear it, footsteps echoing behind me, growing louder and more insistent. I spun around, but the corridor was empty. The temperature plummeted, and my breath misted in the air. Then came the whispers, barely audible at first, a sibilant susurration that grew louder with each passing second. They called my name, not with familiarity, but with an eerie, predatory intimacy.

Panic set in, and I ran. But the asylum had transformed into a labyrinth, corridors stretching into infinity, doors appearing and disappearing at random. My mind was fracturing, each step deepening the sense of dread that gnawed at my sanity. The whispers became screams, the cries of the damned echoing through the halls.

In my frenzied flight, I stumbled into a room that was not on any of the asylum’s blueprints. It was small and windowless, the walls covered in symbols similar to those on the basement door. At the center was a circle of blackened, melted candles. The air was suffused with a palpable malevolence. I realized too late that I had entered the very heart of the asylum’s darkness.

The door slammed shut with a deafening finality, and the temperature dropped to an unbearable cold. My flashlight flickered and died, plunging me into absolute darkness. Then I felt it, a cold, clammy hand wrapping around my throat, lifting me off the ground. I struggled, gasping for breath, but there was nothing to fight against, nothing to see.

As my vision dimmed, I was filled with a sense of utter despair. This was how it would end, alone and forgotten in a place that devoured souls. But then, just as suddenly, the grip released. I collapsed to the floor, gasping for air, my body trembling with fear. The room was empty, but the sense of being watched was overwhelming. I knew I had to get out.

Stumbling through the corridors, I finally found the exit. The sunlight was blinding, the fresh air a shock to my system. I drove away from Hollow Creek Asylum, my hands shaking on the wheel. But the terror had not ended.

The nightmares began that night. Visions of the asylum, the patients, the malevolent figure haunted my sleep. The whispers followed me, even in my waking hours, a constant reminder of the darkness I had encountered. I still have the key, though I’ve tried to rid myself of it. It always finds its way back, a cursed token of my encounter with the abyss.

I fear the entity I encountered at Hollow Creek is not confined to the asylum. It watches, it waits, and it whispers. My sanity is slipping, the boundaries between reality and nightmare blurring. I write this not for sympathy, but as a warning. If you ever find yourself near Hollow Creek Asylum, stay away. Some doors should never be opened, and some horrors should remain buried in the dark.

And remember, once you’ve looked into the abyss, it looks back into you.
