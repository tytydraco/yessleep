Most days, like any child, I spent in my room playing video games. My dad left my mom at a young age. Not like he hit us or anything, he just found out he wasn’t meant to be a dad at the wrong place and wrong time. My mom worked many jobs, so I nearly never saw her, except for the days she was off from every job, which was every month or so. She left snacks, installed a security system into our home and bought a revolver and trained me to use it ONLY for home defense. It was the most she could do for me.

One special summer night, I was lying on my bed, the lights dimmed down on my room. Three low, but noisy knocks sounded on my door. They sounded disproportionate for human hands, but I didn’t mind it back then. A little chime on the security tablet went off. I quickly waddled over to the tablet, taking it off the brown wooden table it sat on.

There were eight cameras set up, camera one was at the front door, camera eight as at this room. Each camera was closer to this room than the last.

I checked the first camera to see who was at the front door. It was a tall person wearing an all black shirt and all black pants, covered with lumps all over.

Robber was the first thing to come to mind. I began to hyperventilate, but I quickly caught myself, took a deep breath, and began to take action.

I took the tablet with me, carefully tiptoeing towards my moms room, which was where she kept the revolver. We couldn’t afford windows, so there was no running.

I frequently checked the tablet, the robber was at camera two now. It was strange, you’d expect a robber to be armed, or have a bag to carry stolen items or ANYTHING. But they didn’t. They just wandered around with arms bigger than their torso and legs combined, swaying side to side.

I finally reached my moms room in what felt like hours. It was so quiet. It was usually quiet since I was alone, but this was not a calming quiet. I felt anxious.

I got to my moms room, grabbed the little vault under her bed, and entered the code into the keypad. The keypad made little beeps with every press.

The safe opened and there it was. A loaded revolver with the hammer clocked back already. I grabbed it and hurriedly stuffed it in my pocket.

I took another quick glance at the tablet, the robber was at camera six now. They’d suddenly looked at the camera.

It’s kind of funny, really.

I checked the tablet so many times, yet I failed to notice this was no robber. It wasn’t even human. The black they were “wearing” was purely their skin. The creature now looked at the camera with a large, toothy grin, it’s eyes facing polar opposites from each other. I held back the loudest scream in my vocal cords.

Once the tablet rung, the police were notified and were already on their way to my house. It was another six minutes until they got here. 

I backed up, away from the opened door. The unsteady thumps of the creatures feet filled the halls. It was here.

My legs failed to act. They shook and shivered, but I still pressed myself up. I took out the revolver, gripping its handle.

Finally, it enters the door. I’m face to face with it now. Not really though, it’s far taller than me. It looks at me and grins. I lift the gun up with shaking hands and fire a bullet directly into its skull. No blood? It’s just skin. All skin. The black mulch covering its head spews in all directions. It’s eyes do not even shift off mine. I clock the hammer back and take a shot to its body. This time, red ooze floods out. It’s most definitely blood. I don’t think it was the creatures though. I clock the hammer back one last time for a final
shot.

I don’t get the next shot. It grabs me, it’s hands perfectly wrapped around my body, almost molded to it on contact. Nothing to do now but scream. I scream and shout. The gun is out of my hands. The creature widens its jaws, inside its body is an assortment of corpses. Animal, adults, kids. I’m sobbing. Suddenly, another person shows up. I can’t see anything, but shots are fired. Multiple of them. The creature tosses me and my skull bashed into the bed post. I’m about to faint when a blur in a blue shirt and a special hat comes up to me. It’s the police. Before they say anything i’m out cold.
