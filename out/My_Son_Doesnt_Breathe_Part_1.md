Three years. Three years is how long me and my wife Selina had tried to have a child. These times were hard on us, we tried many things, IVF, donors, surrogates, but none ever got farther than the first trimester. Not only was this financially and physically taxing for us, it was also emotionally so. We argued and fought many times over our many attempts, but never once did we blame each other.

Before I go on, Spencer, my strong boy. I’m sorry, I should’ve told you sooner. Please contact me soon.

To get a break from our routines, we decided to drive up to my parents house. A nice 2 story home they shared with my elderly grandmother, the place is quite a bit up north so we didn’t get to see them all that often.Once we arrived everything was going smoothly, we caught up over dinner and had a couple of drinks. Eventually, the inevitable topic of grandchildren came up. 

“So Matthew? When am I going to see some grandkids visit?” My mom spoke in a slurred manner, parts of her Japanese accent slipped through. Me and Selina glanced at each other uncomfortably. The room grew silent. “Matt, can you come with me for a minute?” My grandma interjected in Japanese as she began to walk up stairs to her room. 
(For your sakes I have translated my grandmother’s Japanese to the best of my ability)

My grandmother was an incredibly elderly woman, I’m not even sure if anyone, including herself knew how old she was. “Come, sit down.” She motioned towards a chair in her room. As I sat, she grabbed a box from beneath her bed. “You remember the stories I told you? The ones from my village?” She asked this as she fiddled with the padlock on the weathered wooden box. 
No I
“Yeah, of course I do. One caused me to walk around with cucumbers for days.” She chuckled at this as the lock gave way. “Still, that one kept you away from the rivers.” Her grin remained on her face, but as she looked inside the box, her eyes filled with a sense of sadness. 
“There was one I didn’t tell you back then though. Wasn’t appropriate for you at the time. But given your circumstances I think I should tell you now.”

“When I was a girl, my village had an issue. Children weren’t being born, our lineages’ stagnated.” As she told the story, she slowly unpacked the box. “One day, a shaman came to town. He brought us four items. A carved idol, a small pot, strips of paper, and a den-den daiko.” As she listed each of them, she took a matching item out of the box. A fox carved of wood, a cast iron pot no larger than my hand, a strip of paper with symbols written on each side, and then the ceremonial hand drum. “He told us that we can fix our issues, all we had to do is follow his instructions” She opened the pot’s lid, revealing uncooked rice atop which was a thick lock of hair, bundled up using a nearly identical strip of paper to the one from the box. The only difference being its worn and weathered state. She continued

“We listened as he described what we had to do. Place the idol in the pot, cover it with rice, then put the hair of the parents atop the rice.” She demonstrated using the materials in front of her. “Next you will bury the pot for 3 months. Keeping it uncovered until the months had past. Then on the final night unbury the pot, play the drum 3 times, and have the mother consume the contents in the pot” Once again she demonstrates, this time picking up the drum.
DUM DADUM. 
DUM DADUM.
DUM DADUM.

“9 months passed from his first arrival, and the first children in years were born. After that, the shaman left. All I remember about him was his striking green eyes.”

“He was white?” I asked. “No, he wasn’t. All his other features were normal and his accent was that of a native.” She chuckled at my question, before continuing. “Matt, I want you and Selina to do the ceremony. Follow the shaman’s steps, trust me that it will work.” I looked at her dumbfounded. “Listen, Matthew, I'm not joking. Take this box home with you, and let’s head back.” 

The rest of the trip went smoothly, minimal altercations. On the drive back home I told Selina all about the story. As I went on a look grew in her eyes. The exhaustion drained from her face now replaced with determination. “Let’s try it.” I look at her shocked. “What are you saying? It’ll probably give you food poisoning.” 

“But I trust her honey, when have you ever known your grandmother to push us towards danger? I trust her, we have to do it.” Hearing the desperation in her voice, I had no other choice but to give in.

At home, we unpacked the box. Everything was laid out on the kitchen counter, yet a solitary item remained in the box. A note stating. “Remember the words of the green eyed man.” It was my grandmother's handwriting.

As we set up, I picked up the idol feeling its course surface. As I did I felt its warmth, it seemed to pulsate, its temperature inconsistently rising before returning to its base temperature. I turned the idol on my hand, when I spotted kanji at the base. It read,  “吾一” Goichi, the name of my grandfather. 
We placed the statuette in the pot, followed by the rice, and the bundle of our hair.  

That night we buried it in the yard. And we hoped. And we dreamed. And we prayed.

Over the next weeks we observed the lawn. Making sure nothing dug up the pot. But in our watching we noticed something- the lawn hadn’t grown back. In fact it was slowly dying, and I’m not talking the dried, yellow grass, I mean that lawn began to rot. A layer of necrotic, fungal, blackened grass began permeating the lawn, emanating from the exposed dirt patch. Despite the rot growing, there was no odor.

After two days of the layer spreading, we called my grandmother.

“Grandma, we began that thing you told us about. And uh, things have started… rotting.” Before even a second can pass she responds. “Oh don’t worry about that, after all how do you expect it to grow only on rice?” Me and Selina glance at each other perplexed. “Matthew is Selina there?” I handed the phone over to her. “Hey, I’m here.” My grandmother replied immediately once again. “Selina darling, you might start seeing them, but just know they don’t want to hurt you, they will help guide you.” Before me and Selina could respond she hung up the call. “Did she just hang up? Try calling back.” Before we could dial the number, we got a call. Unknown number.
“Hello?” I answered.

“Matthew, thank goodness, we have been trying to call you for hours.” My dad responded, her voice filled with panic and tears.  “I-It’s mom- I mean it’s grandma. I’m so sorry, she collapsed two hours ago. We’re at the hospital right now.”

By the time Selina and I got there it was too late. The service was held a month later, maybe about 8 weeks into the ritual. The whole wake was headed by a shaman from my grandmother's village, an elderly man who my father  identified as my grandma’s cousin. The funeral itself went smoothly, but afterwards I realized something, the shaman, his eyes had glistened a bright and distinct shade of green.

The night after the wake, Selina and I were unwinding in our living room watching Seinfeld. After a while Selina started to cough, I assumed that she was choking on a little bit of water, but then she continued. I turned the tv off and turned to Selina. “Woah! You okay?” She shook her head as she continued to cough. “Do I need to call paramedics?” She began to retch and reach into her both. I started slamming my palm against her back in a measly attempt at dislodging whatever was stuck in her throat. She coughed a gut wrenching final wheeze as something finally fell from her mouth. She sat breathing heavily in shock freezing her in place. I looked at the thing she spit out, it was small, pale, almost like a marble encased in a tangle of orange hair and bits of flesh. As I stare at the lump of red, orange, and white, I finally realize what I’m looking at. It is a tooth, not a human one either. It’s a partially blackened, half rotten, fang; like one found in the snarling maw of a dog. 

“What the hell?” Selina spurt out between deep ragged gasps. I let her catch her breath before asking, “Selina? Honey, do you need a doctor?” Her gaze remained fixated on the small bit of viscera she had regurgitated. “No, no I’m fine, let’s just head to bed.” She breaks her gaze and finally looks at me, her eyes wide and full of tears. “Go ahead, I'll clean this up.” I give her a hopefully comforting embrace before I kneel down to clean up the ball of flesh and hair. 

As I swept the floor, I found my gaze wandering towards the window overlooking our backyard. There, in the field of rot, stood two figures watching me. The two figures were an uncanny inbetween of feline and canine forms, foxes. The gaze of their vibrant green eyes seeped into the pores of my skin. I go to open the window for a better look, but as I slide it open I’m left staring into my empty and dying yard. I chalked it up to the adrenaline and the stress playing tricks on my mind, so I finished cleaning up and went to bed.

Three more weeks pass, it’s now 11 weeks in, the mold had nearly taken over the entirety of our backyard save for the patch of dirt where our final hope laid. Selina walked up to me, sitting next to me on the porch. 

“How much longer?” She asked. “I think 2 more week-.” I’m cut off before I could finish by a loud thud coming from behind us. We hastily turned around looking for the source of the sound. There behind us, laid a small wooden figurine; another idol, nearly identical to the one buried not even 10 feet away from us. We look up to the roof, looking for whatever dropped it. There I see them again, two foxes with radiant green eyes. They sat with their preternaturally large forms obscuring the sun's glare. They leaped down elegantly from the roof, only then is when I truly took in their huge stature. For context I’m not the tallest person ever, I’m 5 '6 and Selina is 5' 8, yet these foxes tower above me and Selina both. Their snouts stuck in a mean snarl, pieces of their lips were missing, patches of their fur have fallen out leaving their raw and sinued muscle exposed. Selina and I stood frozen, our eyes locked with their milky yet vibrant jade eyes. The beasts leaned down, ready to pounce at any moment. One second past. Then two. Then a third. Before the fourth moment could arrive, they simultaneously lunged towards us. Instinctively I covered Selina jumping in front of her.

I felt the sharp teeth sink into my torso tearing across my body. All I saw was red and blue, what I only assumed to be my severed veins flying out of my rapidly dying body. The teeth relentlessly pulled and snapped at my legs and torso. I blacked out.

Then I woke up. Plastic tunnels and copper lines wrapped around and ran through my frail body. At the moment I only had one thought. 
“Where’s Selina?” I felt the words leave the desert that I called my throat. I looked to my side, I saw flowers and ‘Get well soon’ balloons piled up on my bed stand. Underneath a lamp I saw Selina sleeping in an armchair, not a scratch on her. That’s when I realized, there were no physical injuries that I could see or feel. I tried to get up, in the process disconnecting different vital trackers. This set off the heart rate monitor, the loud and monotonous ringing of a flat line permeated the room. 

With a shake Selina wakes up. “Oh thank god! DOCTOR HE’S AWAKE!” She shouted leaning halfway out of the door. After several doctors poked and prodded at me with different tools, they told me what happened. “You see, after your wife has sat next to you, you seem to have passed out. After rushing you to the hospital we determined that you had had a nasty lung infection, one that is only caused by inhaling spores from a rare, but non-lethal species of fungus. Now Selina told me you have been experiencing some mold in your house, no?” 
I responded absentmindedly. “Uh huh, yeah we are taking care of it.” My mind racing with the memories of being mauled by the two creatures.
“Good, I’m going to prescribe you an antibiotic inhaler, and advise you to stay away from the area containing the mold. After that we just need to make sure your vitals are stable, and have you sign some forms and you’ll be on your way.” The doctor spoke with a practiced cadence, he’d probably repeated the whole interaction thousands of times.

Selina drove us home, her shoulders were tensed up the entire time. “Selina, what’s wrong.” Her eyes remained on the road. “Tonight. Tonight’s the night Matthew, I worried so much about you that I only just now realized. Tonight we unbury the answer to our prayers.” We stayed silent the rest of the way home.

When we got home it was dark out already. The night sky overhead as we walked through the house. With shovel and drum in hand we walk onto the back porch, that’s when I spot it, a small wooden carving. I lean down and pick it up; it’s an idol, a painted wooden carving of a fox snarling. At the bottom of the statuette is a small engraving, it was the kanji “松” Matsu. My grandmother's name. I look up to show Selina, but she is already digging, I put it in my pocket and go to help her. We dug, putting shovel to dirt for half an hour. CLANG. We hit the pot, I carefully lifted the small cast-iron pot out of the hole, to my surprise it was significantly lighter. We bring it inside.

At the table Selina and I sat trying to make sure that we remembered the instructions correctly. 

“I have to swallow whatever is in there, right?” Selina asked. “Yeah, while you do, I have to play the drum three times.” I pick up the pellet drum and shake it a little; when I do this, the pot rattles, scraping itself towards Selina. We look in disbelief. 

“Selina, we don’t have to do this. It’s not-.” She cuts me off. “No, we have taken it this far, we need to go through with it.” She pulls the pot towards her. “You okay?” I nod in response.

She slowly lifted the lid. Inside, where there once was rice, and hair, and wood, sat a single item. A small, mouse sized item. Selina picked it up with two fingers. For what seemed like the thousandth time in the past three months, we stare at each other concerned. In her hand sat a fleshy lump, pale and barren, it writhed and wriggled. “Ready?” She asked. I prepare the drum, rotating it twice. DUM DADUM. The thing began to screech, a shrill ear piercing sound. Selina raised it to her mouth. I rotate the drum again. DUM DADUM. It’s writhing motion violently and sporadically increases. Selina pops it in her mouth, her face imploded in disgust. I rotate the drum a final time. DUM DADUM. Selina swallows the thing whole. I shutter, a chill trickles down my spine. Selina chugs a glass of water, retching as she realizes what she just ate.

We spent the rest of the night in silence, the pure shock of the event keeping us awake. The next morning I got up first, I went to make coffee for me and Selina. Then I looked out back, the lawn's state of decay was gone, in the place of the dirt patch sat a young sapling surrounded by flat stones. At the base of the sapling three green eyed figures sat. A man and two foxes. The man stared at me, without looking away I walked towards the phone. I glanced down at the phone, I had to call the police. I dial 9 1 1 and the phone begins to ring, I look back towards the yard. Nothing, the sapling and yard remained, yet the figures had seemingly dissipated into the morning fog. 

“911, what is your emergency?” I don’t respond. “Hello? Is everything okay?” The woman on the other side of the line had grown more worried. “Uhh, yeah sorry, I’m fine it was a false alarm.” I say still fixated on the newly planted sapling. “Are you sure sir? We can send someone over if you need it.” The operator's voice had grown exasperated.“No, that’s not necessary, so sorry. Have a great day.” I hung up the phone and walked back to bed, there I was greeted by a surprise.  Selina, sat up in bed with the widest grin on her face. “It worked.” She chuckled. I looked down to see her stomach, she seemed to be very visibly pregnant.

We rushed her to the OBGYN, where the doctor stated that she seemed to be three months pregnant. The baby was healthy and steadily growing. It had worked, this child was a final gift from my grandmother. If only I knew the troubles that were to come.
