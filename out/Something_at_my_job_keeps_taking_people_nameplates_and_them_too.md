Something at my job is taking the nameplates next to our offices. And then it takes the people too.

A few weeks ago, I started working at a meat packing plant just outside of town. It’s moderately big, almost a hundred people, works 24 hours a day for 5 days of the week and get deep cleaned on weekends. I don’t work on the floor though.

I started my new job as a junior industrial engineer on Monday and Chase, the actual IE onsite, tells me that at some point soon he’ll be transferring to another office. Like, the actual office office that’s in the city. He says that they just need to find someone to fill his position and then he’ll be off.

Now every day at 8:00 everyone in the admin section, about 7 people including the maintenance manager, goes to a meeting and talks about what’s going on. What went well last night, what went wrong, what are we doing tomorrow. You know that sort of thing, a huddle. I know this seems a bit random to bring up, but this is where things started going wrong.

Anyway, I get to work on Tuesday and go to the meeting and what do you know, Chase isn’t there.

“Was I really such a bad employ that Chase quit on day 1?” I ask jokingly. Everyone laughs for a few minutes before the plant manager, Fill, speaks up.

“I guess, but they never told me about it. I come in and see his name isn’t on the office door, but I never saw him pick up his stuff. I guess he’ll be in later to get his stuff.”

This makes sense for everyone there since, you know, we were expecting Chase to move to the other office. We also expected him to show back and grab his stuff, and we expected someone to replace him.

We also expected someone to be able to contact him.

Turns out that there were some pretty important files that I needed to get filled out by my manager, who was supposed to be Chase, before I could actually do anything other than watch cheap onboarding videos about company culture and reminded not be a dick. Like, I can’t even log into my email to remind him until he goes onto some company website and confirms I completed my training.

Fill has his number so he goes and gives Chase a call but he doesn’t answer. Apparently this is weird for Chase since he always has his work phone on him and he never seems to miss calls. After about three hours of trying to call him I suggest that maybe he had a family emergency or something and that was why we couldn’t get to him, he forgot his phone or he was flying. It made sense and it also explained why he hadn’t told anyone or taken the stuff from his office.

It did not explain why his nameplate was missing from the office door, but no one really noticed that until later.

On Wednesday I show up and we get to the meeting, and our accountant is gone. The plant manager is kind of peeved that people are apparently taking off without telling him and jokingly threatens us with retraining if it keeps happening. He also says that he hasn’t been able to get in contact with Chase, but he emailed corporate to try and get my permissions instated so I could do my job.

My office is at the end of a hallway so I would walk past everyone whenever I have to do anything. The first really weird thing I noticed was movement in Chase’s office. I saw it out of the corner of my eye so I go to look at the window in the door. Half of the offices have windows in the doors, half don’t, not sure why. Anyway, I look into the empty office and… nothing, probably just my imagination.

Then I go past what was the accountant’s office and I notice that her name plate is gone. I don’t remember what it was, Caroline or Carrol or something with a “car” in it. It didn’t matter, her name plate was gone. It was weird since The last 2 days I swear it was there, but I thought I was just misremembering things.

I spend the rest of my day browsing reddit on my phone and just before I leave, Fill comes and tells me that I should get my access sometime tomorrow.

Thursday, someone else is gone. Fill is actually getting mad now, three people in admin positions just up and leaving without any sort of warning. Apparently the guy who left also has to fill out some really important reports everyday so he MUST inform us if he can’t make it so that someone else can get those done. Fill can’t because he has meetings for today but he does know the guy’s password so it looks like the new guy can go and fly someone else desk for an hour.

End of the meeting, me and the plant manager walk down the guy’s office, he’s telling me the basics about a site I need to go to and pull data from, and I see is that the nameplate is gone. I absent mindedly blurt this out and Fill stops to look at the door.

And then he jumps back startled. I ask what’s wrong but he just opens the door and walks into the office. Its then that I notice the light is on.

“I thought I saw him…” Fill starts to say before he backs out and closes the door.

“He must be in the bathroom, must have crapped his way through the meeting,” I say, trying to rationalize how the light is on and the computer is unlocked but the guy didn’t show up.

This answer works for both of us so we split and I go back to my office to continue browsing reddit.

About 2 hours later Fill comes and tells me that the guy still hasn’t submitted the reports. I ask if he checked the bathrooms but Fill just says that he’s tried everything. He’s called everyone who’s been gone and no one is answering and he needs stuff done right now. So I get the opportunity to go and pull data, run it through and excel sheet, and then upload it.

Now as I sit down in that guy’s office the first thing I notice is how the chair seems, for lack of a better word, occupied. I know what you’re thinking, ‘of course its occupied, you’re in it’. No, it was like, I was where someone else was. I couldn’t run data through an excel template if I tried, but try I did since I just wanted to get out of there and go home.

On my way out I let Fill know that the data is sent and tell him that, since I still don’t have access to anything, I was just going to go home early. He told me that the person who should have gotten me access hasn’t been responding to his emails, so I might not get it tomorrow either.

Friday I get there and someone else is gone. At this point only me, the plant manager, and the maintenance guy are there. Apparently this is something that’s happening at all of our facilities because Fill has to read us a paper telling us that we must, must, MUST, tell our supervisors before we take leave for any reason. He goes off about how leave without warning is always leave without pay and how it doesn’t matter how many sick days we have.

And then there’s a crash in the hall. Naturally we all go out to figure out what crashes in the hallway of a small admin building. The answer apparently is the door to someone’s office. The accountant’s office.

Her door is physically damaged, like someone was on the other side ramming it or something. Just then Fill gets a phone call and who else would it be other than our mysterious accountant.

Also, the maintenance manager opens the door, because of course he does. Thankfully the only thing we find on the other side is a messy office and the accountants’ phone sitting on their desk. Why and how the phone was there, and how exactly it managed to somehow call our plant manager who was not even 10 feet away, despite being in what was clearly an abandoned office, I don’t know.

The maintenance manager decides that the best thing to do in this situation is to go investigate the haunted phone. He gets all of 3 steps inside the office before suddenly realizing that there was a report he needed to run. He definitely didn’t feel like the office was occupied.

I went home early that day, I still didn’t have access to anything.

Now this is where in other stories I go in on Monday and find myself alone with a monster or I find a bloody corpse, or something comes in the night.

No, I called my plant manager in the morning on Monday with intent to quit. I barely get on the phone before Fill tells me 3 things.

1.       Do not come into the office.

2.       I am fired.

3.       He quits.

I don’t really know what to make of this. It was an hour ago when he told me that and now, I’m writing this trying to figure out what to do. Part of me suddenly wants to go to the office now, the rest of me knows that’s a stupid idea. I think getting fired without a good reason means I go ask for unemployment? I guess I’ll go look into that and try to ignore the last week. Get another job somewhere, probably not a meat packing plant. Maybe somewhere where they don’t put our names on the office doors.
