Remote viewing is real. I’ve done it several times in clinical testing environments funded by a corporation looking to commercialize the experience. I was not part of the research group directly, but they were allowing adjacent people such as myself to volunteer. The experience is actually very simple to induce, the level of accuracy and direction are the tricky parts apparently. They simply place a helmet device on your head and have you stare at a strange wave-like effect on a wall. You basically fall asleep and then begin to see exactly what another person is seeing or has seen, not necessarily in real time as I witnessed both past and present events. I was not capable of seeing into the future though. The visualization is just as clear as you are seeing this text right now. Don’t be surprised if first-person entertainment experiences take a huge leap commercially in the coming years.

I glossed over a lot here because the part I need you to understand isn’t that it is real, but how it is. The only reason I’ve been able to piece together how this is possible is because the man that created the helmet device reappeared last week. He was never involved with the research group, so I didn't recognize him when he spoke to me very casually one day. He was a very calm man with a soothing but somewhat haunted tone, like a doctor giving a grim prognosis or something. “You’d never be the same if you knew how it was done” he said at some point in his almost monotone voice. 

Whats the worst it could be? is the device hurting the user or maybe even killing the person on the other end? If so, I definitely would like to know regardless if this guy thinks I would or not. so I say fuck it, tell me. he obviously wanted to anyway or else he wouldn’t have approached me. 

The truth is the most horrifying thing imaginable and he was right, It has changed me.

Our universe is unimaginably large and works in ways we are only starting to understand. We only have the ability to understand this because of the consciousness we are experiencing. Electromagnetic waves interact with the brain to form our consciousness which then gives us our perception of reality. It’s an interface for us to navigate the universe.

The device mapped out that interface and collected data for a “base consciousness“. Data that could overwrite another interface so an existing one could temporarily take its place. It didn’t work. The problem was the data already perfectly matched in all interfaces including the ”base consciousness“. The only way to make it work is to effectively switch off the user consciousness using EM waves from the helmet.

The implications of this are both profound and terrifying. The only explanation as to why the device works this way is…we are all the same person. If you switch off your personal interface, you immediately switch to another but not in linear time. The data for our consciousness isn't governed by local space/time. So right now you are reading this as you, but in a non linear future/past/present you are writing this as me. The same goes for everyone you’ve ever met, you will eventually have interfaced with them and lived their life.

We will be and are you, me, every murderer, every victim, every master, every slave, the person you love, and the person you hate. we are you and you, me, and we’ll experience every single horror of this universe.
