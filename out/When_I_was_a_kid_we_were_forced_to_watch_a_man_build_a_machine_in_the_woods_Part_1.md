The first I saw of the machine was a weathervane.

Before that, though, I’d heard The Engineer starting to make it.

For days, the harsh noise of construction emanated from the trees behind my childhood home. The distant thumping of a nail being hammered into wood at the break of dawn. The unmistakable whirring of a power drill during dinner, drowning out my family’s voices. The high-pitched twisting of a circular saw, wailing in the dead of night.

I’d mentioned it to Mom - that it was difficult to sleep through the clamor - but she’d brushed me off. Not that I blame her. I was six.

Only the young could hear its cogs turning.

Only the four of us could see the weathervane, peeking above the treeline like a newly planted flag.

\- - - - - 

I vividly remember that morning.

The drill was whirring louder than usual. Felt like the damn thing was twisting into my ear. I shot up from the kitchen table, tumbled into the family room, jumped onto the couch chest-first, and peered out through the window, searching for the source of the racket.

I scanned the thicket, knees digging into leather couch cushions, cheeks warming as I pressed my face into the sun-touched glass, though all I could appreciate was the dense overgrowth. The same line of old, tightly clustered white oaks that’d always been there.

But as my eyes rose, there it was, thirty feet into the air, cast-iron glinting against the sunlight.

A weathervane.

It was still. I’d been downright battered by the wind when I’d joined my dad and our St. Bernard, Roscoe, for a walk half an hour earlier, and yet, it was still.

I squinted.

There was something else wrong with it.

The arrow was mostly horizontal, though the edge of it curved, making the tip point down. Even back then, I knew the arrow was supposed to point *across,* running parallel with the wind, not *down*, towards the earth.

My six-year-old mind mulled over the oddity, squirming restlessly, shifting my weight from one leg to the other and back again.

As I stared, something happened.

The weathervane flickered. A small, shuddering twitch.

I gasped. Peeled my cheek from the glass and leaned back.

The metal spasmed again. A third flicker. A fourth.

Then, all at once, it began spinning. 

The revolutions were impossibly quick and shockingly violent, faster than helicopter blades, motion-blur rendering the object and its earth-facing arrow to look like a giant, vibrating bottlecap.

It was sort of beautiful. 

I stopped squirming.

I climbed down from the couch, eyes fixed on the spinning weathervane.

I trudged through the family room, the kitchen, the hallway, and out the front door, passing my mom, dad, and older sister on the way. They did not look at me. They didn’t seem to register my exodus at all.

A ferocious, seething gust slammed the door shut as I left. I did not flinch.

I walked the perimeter of our house. Dew-kissed grass licked at my calves as the well-trimmed backyard transitioned into unfettered overgrowth. I lumbered into the thicket proper, small hands and awkward legs diligently negotiating the craggy terrain so that my eyes could remain skyward on the spinning weathervane, my new north star.

When it was almost directly overhead, I pushed through a thin veil of branches and thorns, and entered a massive clearing.

Spatially, it didn’t make much sense. 

The trees behind my house shouldn’t have been able to accommodate such an expansive landmark. They were a fence, not a forest: a natural palisade that arbitrarily divided my family’s neighborhood from the next one over. Took me a few seconds to cross through it normally.

But there I was, stepping into a clearing that was bigger than my family’s house. Probably could have fit multiple copies of that three-story colonial within its dome-shaped bounds with room to spare.

The others were already there when I arrived.

They were sitting in a half-circle that looked to be one person short, gathered around a young man in a dirt-caked suit, hammering something into place at the apex of a very tall ladder, right below the weathervane. His tools lay scattered around the feet of the ladder. Handheld drills, cut lumber, saws and nails and hammers and trowels and chisels, radiating in a halo around the beginnings of his design.

We’d been summoned to watch him work.

I crept through the clearing and took my seat next to Bailey. The kids did not greet me. The engineer did not introduce himself.

But the weathervane seemed to respond to my presence.

It slowed to a gradual stop and became still.

I gazed up at it.

He’d stationed it at the top of a narrow wooden pole. Even though the wind whistled through the dome-shaped clearing, it refused to budge. Steam rose from the thin copper spine, like the metal was about to boil. There was something perched atop the downward arrow. A statue where the rooster would be on a typical weathervane.

A gaunt, humanoid figure, features slightly blurred in the hot mist. Their back was arched over the edge of the arrow, like they were peering over it and gazing down at us.

And they had four heads. 

One between their shoulders, with the other three curving over their emaciated torso in a straight line. One on their sternum, two down their belly. 

A skull for each of us.

\- - - - - 

*The Engineer* is the name I’ve given him in retrospect. At the time, though, we just referred to the man with pronouns.

To the four of us - me, Bailey, Glasses, and Mohawk - he was simply *him*.

*“Glasses”* and *“Mohawk”* are given names too, of course. 

Glasses had thick, square-shaped spectacles. Looked like he was wearing a pair of Dad’s scotch tumblers over his eyes. Mohawk had a line of blonde hair extending from his forehead to the base of his neck: a wispy, canary-yellow river that split his shaved scalp into two equal sections.

I don’t remember their real names, nor do I remember their faces or voices.

Very intentionally, I might add.

I’ve worked hard these last twenty years, forgetting, whittling their memories down to nubs, reducing those kids to a single, physical feature. I’d like to think it’s made my life just the slightest bit more tolerable. Compartmentalizing the pain isn’t healing, but some wounds are much too forgone to heal. Better to sever the limb than let the necrosis spread.

All of which is to say,

if I were capable of forgetting Bailey, of misplacing her name in the darker corners of my psyche,

I would’ve done it a long time ago.

\- - - - - 

Over the months that followed, the four of us visited the clearing for a few hours each day. In the morning, the afternoon, during school hours, halfway through a sermon at church, well into the night - no time was off limits. 

I’d see the weathervane spin - or hear it, or feel it aching in my marrow like the flu - and I’d begin to travel to the thicket.

No one ever stopped me. Not my parents, not my teachers, not my provost. Gave the whole process an unspoken validation.

If I wasn’t supposed to be there, why would everyone let me go?

The four of us weren’t friends. My mom and Bailey’s mom were close, so I was at least acquainted with her, but we never really meshed.

Glasses was the most talkative. He’d pose the same two questions every visit.

*“What do you guys think it is?”*

and

*“Who do you guys think* ***he*** *is?”*

Mostly, we’d just shrug in response, eyes anchored to The Engineer. 

The machine was hard to make heads or tails of, but his goal became apparent the more we watched. 

He started with building the ladder, then the pole that held the weathervane. From there, he began construction on a long, winding track, steadily building towards an object positioned at the opposite end of the clearing. A large, frisbee-shaped ring of gray, semi-translucent wax, propped upright by a sort of easel, which held the substance about a foot off the ground.

I tried not to look at it. 

The machine was disconcerting, yes, but I could bury the unease beneath a child-like curiosity.

I couldn’t reconcile the wax, though.

The way it’d undulate, like the surface of a lake after a pebble had been thrown in, wavelets silently pulsing from its center.

The scent that’d find its way to my nostrils if I stared for too long: floral but deathly, like a honeysuckle blooming from rotten pork instead of soil.

It was painfully unnerving. 

So, I pretended the wax wasn’t even there for as long as I could, though it became clear that The Engineer was building towards it, slowly but surely. I’d catch him eyeing it, tools held limply at his side, distracted by its cryptic ripples.

He wasn’t the stranger the TV had warned me about, the stereotypical lecherous old man leaning out the open door of an unmarked white van, candy in one hand, a knife in the other, saliva dripping down cracked lips.

The Engineer looked to be my parent’s age - mid-thirties, maybe a bit younger. 

He had a mop of frizzy, chestnut-colored hair and a swathe of freckles surrounding a pair of frost-tinted eyes. The suit he sported was likely ostentatious when he bought it, but since then, it’d been worn to shreds. The red pinstripe blazer was littered with lacerations of varying severity, walnut-shaped wedges of his white dress-shirt peeking through the damage. His skin was covered with multiple layers of grease and dirt. Far as we knew, he lived in the clearing, with no access to a shower, sleeping next to his machine whenever exhaustion overtook him.

Still, he toiled relentlessly, day after day, month after month, until it finally appeared complete. A continuous circuit the size of a wooden rollercoaster, from the weathervane all the way to the wax.

But it wasn’t complete. Not quite.

He still needed our contributions, our donations,

our perfect portions of flesh.

\- - - - - 

My last visit was in October, about a week before Halloween.

In all that time, The Engineer hadn’t said a word to us. He hadn’t even acknowledged our existence with a wave or a wink. We were ghosts to him.

That afternoon was different, though. 

His voice was coarse, but he spoke casually, like we’d all known each other for years, like we were in on whatever game he was playing.

He stood in front of his grand design, rubbed his hands together nervously, and said:

*“OK - Now, I need you all to watch.”*

I turned to Bailey. She was already looking at me, eyes wide, brow furrowed.

He climbed the ladder. The trees that lined the clearing swayed like breathing lungs - pushing out, then bowing in - inhale, exhale. The wax was undulating more vigorously than normal, pulsing faster and faster as he ascended.

I grabbed her hand. She threaded her fingers through my own.

Once he’d reached the top, he pulled an ivory ball from his pocket. It was slightly larger than an apple and unnaturally smooth.

His wrist tremored.

The thicket breathed quicker.

I squeezed Bailey’s hand until it hurt.

The Engineer placed the ivory ball at the start of the track, directly below the weathervane. The metal creaked clockwise until the arrow was pointing at his hand.

With the gaunt, metallic figure watching, he let go.

The ball rolled down a wooden chute. It knocked into a set of oversized dominoes at the chute’s base. The ball stopped. The dominoes toppled, clacking against each other in the shape of a sinking helix. The last one clicked a button, which activated a lever, which opened a trap door below the ball. It fell a few feet, clunked into a second chute, and began rolling down again.

It continued like this for a while - an intricate sequence of simple events, causes and effects, spiraling in the general direction of the wax.

Further along in the circuit, the ball landed on the edge of a wooden scale, weighted equally with two hanging rocks on each end. I think the momentum was ultimately supposed to carry it up a few inches. From there, one of the weights would release, causing the scale to tip, bringing the ball in the opposite direction. 

That’s not what happened, though.

The ball flew off the track before the weight even released.

It landed on the grass below with a defeated *thud*.

There was a pause.

The four of us looked to The Engineer.

He was catatonic, staring vacantly at the ball.

Without warning, he gripped the sides of his head with both hands, and discharged an unearthly howl. Flocks of frightened birds dispersed from the treeline. Fear galloped down my spine, but I didn’t dare move. When he finally calmed, the man had ripped two thick tufts of brown hair from his scalp.

Then, he swung towards us, and screamed:

*“You see?!”*

None of us knew what to say.

He stomped down the ladder, frenzied, nearly falling off the side multiple times, but he didn’t seem to care. I think he was better able to see our terror when he reached the bottom, because he calmed his movements, walking over to us slowly, contorting his lips into something close to a smile.

His voice was more metered as he approached, but his tone would randomly lilt and hasten, like he was having a difficult time keeping a lid on his frustration, spurts of insanity slipping through the seams every so often.

*“You see, that’s why I’ve needed you all here…”* he clarified, crouching, meeting our eyes.

I shook my head *no,* but what I really meant was: *“We have no fucking idea what you’re talking about."*

He gulped, blinked, and continued.

*“I need to hear the wax chime. I’ve been waiting…I’ve been waiting so long,”* he whispered.

The Engineer shot to his feet. He gestured at the weathervane, wrists wobbling like jelly. His voice abruptly crescendoed.

*“But he requires -”*

His shrill outburst pushed us back. Bailey dug her nails into my palm.

He took a deep, shuddering breath, and started again.

*“He requires perfection. Complete and utter purity. The exact right material, on the exact right track, at the exact right speed, at the exact right time.”*

His smile faltered. He looked away. Put his light blue eyes to the dirt and kept them there.

*“I can’t make it all from trees, though.”*

He peered over his shoulder at the machine, and then back to us, sighing.

*“Everybody sit still, OK?”*

We obliged.

The Engineer examined each of us thoroughly. He appraised Mohawk’s arm with a tape measure and then paced over to where it’d all gone wrong, where the ivory ball had fallen. He then measured the distance between the wooden scale and some nearby scaffolding.

He muttered something like:

*“Hmph. Needs to be a little longer.”*

The man repeated a similar process with the other two. Counted the number of teeth in Glasses’ mouth, his dirty hands wrenching the boy’s jaw open. He squeezed Bailey’s abdomen, swishing her guts around, and then returned to the machine, staring at a small, intestine-shaped tube near the end of the circuit.

Then, it was my turn.

He examined me the longest. Not physically, mind you.

The Engineer just looked into my eyes, like he was trying to see what lay behind them.

After a few minutes, he grinned.

A wide, wolfish crease.

All I received was a pat on the back.

At that point, we were dismissed.

He shouted something as we dispersed, something along the lines of:

*“See you all very, very soon.”*

I’m not one-hundred percent sure, though.

It was difficult to hear anything as I bolted home,

the wind howling in my ears,

my breath heavy and labored like the trees in the clearing.

\- - - - - 

That night, our dog got sick.

His eyes turned moon-tinted. He limped through the family room, spewing blood-tinged bile across the carpet.

My dad was due to take an important cross-continental business call, and Mom was doing an overnight shift at the hospital, meaning he was the only one who could drive us to the vet.

I begged him to reschedule.

Deep down, I knew Roscoe would die if we didn’t get to the emergency clinic ASAP.

My tears caused him to relent.

Thankfully, our dog lived through the night. Needed to stay at the clinic for a few days, but came home to us all the same.

That event seemed inconsequential.

Until this week.

You see, my dad’s choice was a catalyst.

The first domino to fall in a different - but related - machine.

Three weeks later, we’d move out of my childhood home. Strangely, I was never called to the clearing during that time, but the first night in our new house, hundreds of miles away, I felt it.

The faint aching in my marrow.

It wasn’t enough to pull me anywhere, but it still kept me up most of the night.

The following morning, I woke up to the sound of my mother crying as she spoke to someone on the kitchen’s landline. I eavesdropped from the top of the stairs. Eventually, she hung up and explained the situation to my dad.

Bailey’s mom was inconsolable.

Her daughter was missing.

Three kids were missing, actually.

And their remains are still missing to this day.

\- - - - - 

For the last twenty years, I considered myself lucky. Thought I’d escaped just in time.

But I got a letter yesterday.

I absentmindedly slipped my finger beneath the envelope’s flap and pulled a sheet of crinkled, dirt-caked paper from it.

The message was neatly written at the center of the page in crisp, red ink:

*“Funeral Bells*”

Initially, I didn’t recognize the phrase, but the more I considered it, the more I realized it harbored a terrible familiarity.

I picked up the envelope.

No return address.

I tapped my finger against the back of it, and I felt something.

I flipped it over.

A thin layer of gray wax had been used to seal the letter, and a faint insignia had been pressed into it.

A gaunt man with multiple heads curling over his frame, four total.

I wasn’t lucky.

The Engineer didn’t forget about me.

It’s all been just another piece of a complex, ever-churning machine.

One that I think may finally, truly,

be coming to [its end.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
