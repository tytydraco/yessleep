   To start this story off I want to say that because of this incident I haven't been able to enjoy movies PERIOD! Me and a few other survivors of the incident are making attempts at group therapy.


  For a little background information I loved movies. Anytime that I am available for one I would go to a movie theater or watch one on one of the many streaming services I have.


  When me and my friends play a movie guessing game I always win and that's why we don't play those anymore. 


  I also have a movie review channel on YouTube which right now has about 60,000 subscribers. Sadly I had too quit it after the incident if you were wondering about that.


  Anyways, one summer day I went to one of the major blockbuster movies that was showing at my favorite theatre. I went in, payed for my ticket, grabbed some popcorn and drinks, and went to the ticket holder.


    "Another day at the movies Sam?" The ticket holder asked me.


    "You Bet Charlie", I said to the ticket holder who me and him got accustomed too real well over the years.


  "I hear it's supposed to be a good one", Charlie says to me.


 "I hope so, if it is I'll post a vid about it on my channel", I tell him.


  Charlie nods and hands me back my ticket. "See you on the other side", he says and i nod to him as I make my way to the room thats showing the movie. I quickly scanned the aisle's as I find a good seat to sit.


  A couple of minutes before the commercial's ended the whole room was packed.


  ("Good thing I came early"), O thought to myself.


  On the right side to me was a young woman with what looks like her boyfriend right beside of her. Also on the left was a middle aged fellow who looked like he also had some time on his hands.


  I smiled a big smile as the movie was about to start and everyone started cheering.


   The first few minutes the movie was going great. Everyone including me was enjoying themselves unless their was a few that tried to hide the fact that they should've picked a different film.


 Then, this is when it all started.


 As the scene the movie was on suddenly started to flicker black and white like it was glitching the screen. 


 Then the whole movie screen turned black.


  When this happened everyone got upset and started getting angry and saying stuff like "we should go get a refund". As people started getting up the screen turned back on again and pulling clapped as they went back to their seats thinking the person in the back fixed what was wrong. 


  I started back to eating my popcorn as the couple on my right looked like they were about too make out.


  But the weird was the movie wasn't showing the movie we were watching. Now we opened up to a forest as the camera is smoothly traveling until it stopped at an old shack. It looked like the shack was liveable for a person or a family.


Then we headed inside of the cabin as the front door opened and as the camera man went inside and shut the door. 


  The inside looked like your average log cabin out in the woods except it was old and rusty. Has a few animal heads posted on the walls. 


  By now a lot of people were asking questions and going as far as "what the he'll". Even a couple of people were going to head out the door.


  As the scene stayed on the inside of that shack the people that were going to leave made some terrified noises. As all of us in the theatre looked in the direction we could see them open the door as it wouldn't budge.


   "What the hell?" they said, "Let us out!" some screamed. Seeing this unfold my heart was beating out of my chest.


  Then a couple of aisles in front of me a man screamed. As we all looked at his direction and crowded around him we saw in terror what he was screaming at.


 The woman sitting beside him had none of her facial features. She was just looking like a plain old mannequin. 


 Then we heard another scream as someone pointed to the movie screen. The woman was inside the movie! She was screaming for help as she looked terrified. 


 As this was happening an old man and another woman appeared on screen as we all looked and saw that they were also looking like mannequin's in the theatre but whole on the screen.


   It went on like this until there was only 10 of us left.


 The people in the movie were trying to calm themselves down and looking around the shack for clues.


 That was when one of the first people looked in the direction of the so called "camera man" and screamed a bloodcurdling scream that the rest of us will remember for the rest of our life's. 


  As soon as the woman screamed the movie screen flashed off again leaving us in darkness.


  Then as the screen once again flicked right back on it was a seen out of a horror movie.


 We all puked at the site as we were all trying to get out of the room but the doors were locked.


 The people that were just enjoying a movie with us a while ago were now strung apart throughout the whole shack. It was just pure terror looking in that screen as the titles supposed credits then went up. 


  At that moment the doors unlocked and we all burst through the doors. The employee's called the police as we were asked about what happened.


As the cops scoured the place we found out that the person that was the one that put the original movie in was found dead in the room.


 They took the movie that had the dead patrons and gave it too the government to see if they can figure out what happened.


  So now you know our story. Why the rest of us won't go into the movie theatre again because we know it will happen to us next.


 Just take caution next time you do go into one. 


  And one final thing if you do: Please enjoy the movie for me.
