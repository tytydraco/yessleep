A few months ago, I started taking walks at night. 

I had not been getting out much since I started my new job, rented a place in a nice, calm part of town and finally got my life something resembling together, after a long period of drifting aimlessly. My whole life, really. Paying the bills on a spacious studio apartment meant sinking every moment I had into work and chores, and I was starting to feel the restlessness that always came to me after too much time spent in cubicles and walls that started closing in on me no matter how nice the wallpaper, and I needed to get out.

It was a nice change of pace, having some time to myself to process and grab a smoke while looking at a clear sky full of stars. My idea of going out used to be getting trashed and spending the next day recovering so I could do it all over again, but I was getting used to crisp air and listening to the thoughts in my head for once, even if they’re sometimes biting.

It’s a nice neighborhood, like I said, with lots of rustic houses lit up by string lights in the gardens, and a few apartment buildings like my own strewn about, so I’m never scared to wander as late as I want, listening to some new album I haven’t had the time to catch up on, or trusty old Cure if nothing else. There are never very many people out this time of year, which makes it peaceful, and the occasional dog-walker or late shift worker always shares a friendly smile, and I’m left to stroll the tiny park areas, enjoying the way nighttime always makes everything more cinematic and moody than the gray daylight of autumn. Slowly I’ve mapped out the entire area on my lazy strolls, taking this way or that, venturing into new, winding streets and always finding something picturesque to see – an unfamiliar greenhouse or a frosty duck pond. I’m not entirely familiar with the area just yet to where I don’t sometimes get a little lost, but I’ve got a pretty good sense of direction and I’m getting there. 

Sounds idyllic, I can hear you say. Why am I writing about this boring stuff?

Well, the other night I found a house I’d never seen before.

It was a regular house -- it is a regular house, perfectly ordinary and normal, if a little out of place with its stark white paint among the red-tiled and wooden-knotted styles of the rest of the neighborhood, but there's all kinds nestled in there. My favorite is a gray-stained one with a roof the size and sharpness of an old church, and a yellow, almost Victorian style one with a little turret. 

I couldn’t tell you why the white-painted house stuck out to me, or why a strange feeling made my skin crawl when I saw it. I just knew it felt unpleasant.

It’s situated at the end of a bend in the road, where the woods behind it meet a highway far away behind the thick of pine trees, and it stands just a little distant to the rest of the neighborhood. the streetlights stop reaching because there's nothing to light up over there. They're doing some construction at the end of the road that looks perpetually not in progress, just scraps of metal and hardware stacked and waiting, and it’s the one area of the neighborhood that doesn’t feel homely. Maybe that's what got to me, that sort of liminal feeling that only industrial structures at night give you.

In any case, after the first time it caught my eye, I started walking past it every time I went out. I don’t know why. Oddities have always drawn me in, and there’s a pleasant little rush in finding strange things at a safe distance, this tiny five minute moment every night that would intrigue me at the start of my walk and get the gears going in my head for some short story or other before I turned back to my quaint neighborhood.

*Theres something wrong with that house*, I’d think every time I passed it, smiling a little at my own silliness. *It's too still. Too stark, somehow. Why are the lights never on?*

Frankly, it was a good question. Even though I'd start walking in the evening, I still had to get up in the morning, so it wasn't like I was out there at three A.M. or anything, and the lights were always on in every other house I’d see. Someone would be preparing for bed, watching TV lazily in the living room, scraping the leftovers from their dinner into a container in the kitchen.

I like watching people. I like throwing quick glances at windows, catching glimpses of their day to day. I live a mostly solitary life, and there’s something fascinating to me about people, their habits and their things, their choice of bookshelves and lamps and pictures lining their walls, the life they’ve accumulated over the years and inhabit daily without thinking about it. It says so much about them, these boxes they live in, their places of safety. I’ve always felt like a solitary observer of everyone around me, taking quiet notes of little details like that, an explorer in a strange world of domesticity I’ve never had myself.

Put it like that, maybe I’m just lonely.

In any case, this house had none of that. Nothing for me to see, to analyze and turn to stories in my head. If there was furniture, I couldn’t see it because these people went to bed at eight every night, and there was nothing on the front lawn, not even a car or a watering hose, just well-kept green grass that felt bare-boned  somehow. Like someone doing the very least of the concept of living. Like someone playing house with no imagination.

Listen, I’m an overthinker, so take all of this with a grain of salt.

I guess that's why I kept obsessing over it, why I kept wandering by first at the start of my route and then sometimes to finish, trying to get anything out of that place at all. Any semblance of personality, of that essence that any other home would give me. Who were the people that lived there? You'd think no one did, but someone kept that lawn well maintained, someone would periodically open and close the blinds on the second floor. I walked by it once in daylight before work, and the blinds in one small window were closed where they had been open the night before, so someone had to have done that. Still no lights on, and the windows were just dark and empty as usual, contrasted by the pristine white paint, as if daylight just couldn't penetrate that place. A child's drawing of a house before they'd gotten bored and wandered off, not bothering to fill in those classical awkward squares for curtains and crude flowerpots.

Just emptiness. 

Interesting to me, because emptiness like that isn’t easily achieved. We leave some kind of traces of ourselves everywhere, whether we like to or not, simply by living. Even the trees outside were anonymous. No fruit, or markings on the bark. No treehouses, no decorations. Just trees, in the most basic sense of the word. It made me think of a poem I liked: *when all you need to know of a place is, do people live there. If they do, you know everything*. I felt like I knew nothing. Not about the house, nor its inhabitants. Nothing about life in general to be honest.

Who keeps a whole house just to visit on occasion? What house would stay uninhabited for long, especially such a spacious one in such a charming neighborhood? Someone had to live there, but they seemed to never be there, and I'm sure that once this thought hit you, you'd also be intrigued. Maybe not as much as me, but you haven't been there.

You haven't felt the nothingness.

I like horror. I love horror actually, it's my favorite genre when it comes to films, books, games, you name it. Creepy podcasts about monsters from folklore, unsettling historical facts about torture and plagues, even just unsolved stories like the Dyatlov pass is my jam, and I’ve read every creepypasta under the sun. It's been a rough time in my life lately, before I finally got this job, and my last relationship was a trainwreck I still haven't recovered from and maybe never will. I haven't been sleeping well... Ever, really. I romanticise things to cope with my fucked up childhood, and I’ve always made up little stories in my head to make the world around me seem less daunting, or more exciting, or just to be anywhere else than where I am. I've been on antidepressants since July. The same kind my mother used to take.

The same kind of ghosts that plague my mind also haunted hers.

I'm telling you all of this to be fully honest, so you know that I have a vivid imagination, that I try to escape the pressing bleakness of reality as much as I can, that I'm not doing well and never really have. So you know, that I'm an unreliable narrator. It feels important, it feels clean, that you know as well as me that it all could have been a trick of my mind, that it all could have a perfectly reasonable, normal explanation. Though I still can't explain what happened that night.

I still don’t really understand.

I was walking a little later than usual, nearer to midnight, because it was a Friday and I didn't have work the next day, but I'd had a mess of a workday earlier. The kind that never seems to end, where things just keep stacking up and everything around you that usually runs smoothly keeps failing, until you think you'll never get out. I finally escaped sometime after eight, and got home to make dinner in a pissed off mood, and burnt that too. It was just one of those days.

My walks were sanctuary though, and I still dragged my ass out into the crisp air after lying around feeling sorry for myself on the couch for a bit, finding nothing good to watch on the TV and hitting every wrong note on my beat up guitar. 

To amuse myself, as usual, I decided to take a tour of the House. Since my discovery of it, it has permanently become the House, capital letters, in my mind. An entity. My own private little Scooby Gang Mystery. The world's most boring horror story, where the only horror was the absence of things instead of anything horrific that was actually there.

Well, until that night, anyway.

That night, I saw something. Something, finally, in the little window where the blinds would move where nothing else did. An outline, a shape, almost imperceptible in the dark, but unmistakably there.

Remember, this is not a spooky neighborhood, and there are still streetlights somewhere in the distance and a neighbouring house, even if it's farther away than usual. There was just enough light from the outside, to make out that shape in the window, and I didn't immediately find it unsettling. It's a damned weird house in my mind, but I can still understand the difference between what's real and what isn't. At least I think I can. I'm not so sure anymore.

"Oh, someone does live there," was my immediate thought. "there goes the theory that it’s uninhabited or for sale."

My second thought, after getting a little closer, was, "are they looking at me?"

I couldn't tell, because the shape in the window was all black, something just a little darker than its surrounding. The blinds were pulled all the way up, fully exposing the glass of it, and behind it I could just see someone vaguely human-shaped. Long hair, when I got closer. I think they were looking at me, because I've never felt so watched in my whole life. So seen, so exposed. I can't explain it, because how could I, but it was that prickly feeling up the back of your neck, hair-raising thing that you sometimes get, and then you turn around and someone who was watching you at the bus stop or coming up behind you on a running trail appears, and you think nothing of it. It happens. Just an old reflex from more animalistic times.

It was that, but turned up a million times stronger. Unbearable, almost. More like what a deer caught in headlights must feel just before the car hits and breaks their bones.

I got closer. The shape didn't move. I walked all the way up beside the House where the road bends, and the shape did not move. Did not fix anything in the window, because there was nothing to fix. Didn’t fiddle with the blinds, didn't turn away when they saw me approach and stare. Just stood there, perfectly still, as still as the rest of that House, as still as everything in that weird bubble universe of a garden. Thinking about it then, I realized I'd never seen the trees sway in any breeze.

It stood there as if its only purpose was to stand there. It stood there, as if it was waiting for something. 

It stood there, as if it was waiting for me.

I walked by.

What the hell else was I supposed to do? Stay there, staring back like a freak? People are allowed to stand in their windows, they're allowed to do whatever they want in their homes. I was the weirdo out there, making up nonsense because my mind won't ever shut up, and no matter what, what I felt was irrelevant.

I walked by, because I was scared.

I couldn't get home fast enough, all the time feeling like that watched feeling never left me, that thing boring its gaze into the back of neck. I don't know why I thought of it as a thing. It was a person, clearly, but it was a person as much as that House was a house. rudimentarily. Barely. Emptily.

I got home and I drank three beers, not giving a shit about the warnings on my meds, and fell asleep watching something stupid on TV, some boring talk show about local politics droning me into sleep with its mundanity.

You'd think I had nightmares. That my spooky brain would take this fucked up event and turn it into a feast of horrors, but I didn’t dream anything. I woke up, and the space between the previous night and late morning was entirely empty to me. Not the kind of blackout you get from being drunk, not that. I’ve had my fair share of those over the years and this wasn't blissful darkness. I still had the inexplicable feeling that I had dreamt, that I had been somewhere, the way you go to places in your mind when you dream and understand that time has passed, but that the place was a nothing where something should have been. Just emptiness. Just the House, I suppose.

It was still enough to amuse me. I don't scare easily. You don't get through the kind of shit I've been through by being easily scared. People do, memories sometimes, that cloying feeling of pathological unwellness that rots you from the inside. The hard truths in life do, like the fact that sometimes the people who love you the most will cut you the deepest because they just can’t help themselves. Not people in windows. Not scary stories. Not made up things. Not the things that should scare me, that are designed to. Real intimacy, now that's fucking terrifying if you ask me. This? This was funny. It was exciting. It was something that wasn't boring and mundane when everything else seemed to be, and honestly I couldn't wait to go back.

Now I know why people in horror movies act like idiots. Because they are, because theyre fucked up, because we all have something in our heads that wont let us rest. Because we never quite outgrow that urge to touch a hot stove just to see what happens, just to feel our skin sizzle a little. Some of us don't even have anyone to teach us not to. Some of us have our hands pressed against the burner and held there, and we learn to like it.

So, back I went. I pretended to have a whole Saturday full of things that normal people do,  washing clothes and dishes and catching up on some vacuuming, taking a long bath and reading a magazine, messing around on the computer for a bit. All the while pretending like I wasn't waiting, like I wasn't in standby mode until night time, when I would go back to that House and maybe catch a glimpse of my watcher again. More realistically see nothing and realize that I didn't even see anything the night before. To be honest, I'd also had a beer with dinner. Maybe two, I don't recall. Actually, I’d like not to recall, but I know.

As soon as time came around, around the same time as the night before, I was out the door and lighting up a smoke, saying hello to the rare neighbor on their way to town to have a pub-night with friends or the like. It really is a sleepy little place, and I'm glad, because too much noise and hustle drives me crazy. I hated living in the city. Here I feel like a ghost, a dark, ill-fitting shape of something that's awkwardly settled into an easier life, a vampire in retirement. Out of place, but content.

The House was of course where it always was, waiting for me. Blank, pale face with black, unseeing eyes. nothing in the window. I remember actually sighing, in relief of disappointment, I'm not sure which. And so I stood there, in the dark, by the still trees and my still, empty House and felt a little dejected. A little stupid. I lit a cigarette, and smoked for a bit, still enjoying the vast night, the moon and the stars. I cheered myself up by thinking that it was the weekend after all, and I could play some guitar when I came home, maybe call my friend I haven't heard from in ages and see if she was doing better. I stood there for a while, finishing my cigarette and lighting another, fiddling with my phone. Maybe I was waiting, truth be told.

I was selecting an album to play and stubbing the cigarette out on the ground, and in that movement I saw it, out of the corner of my eye. The shape.

It was standing there again, so still and so dark, and the prickly feeling at the back of my neck came back. I was pretty close to the House, closer than I'd ever gotten before, almost to the gate, and I suppose I wouldn't have heard the blinds open, it's a small noise, but... I think I might have. I should have. I have really good hearing, hypervigilance my doctor calls it, attuned to a pin drop on the floor above me sometimes. 

To the smallest cough, to what feels like peoples thoughts sometimes. It's the world's most annoying superpower, and I always have to plug my ears to get any sleep if I don’t manage to focus on something lulling from the TV. I could hear the faint sounds of music from the house way up the street, and the highway was a muffled buzz masked by the woods, and I could hear all these things as clearly as I always can, but I didn't hear the blinds open, even though I was just a few feet from the source. It's... Whatever, that's normal, I don't know why I'm focusing on that right now.

I'd periodically been looking up at the House, at the window, and a minute ago the blinds that had been closed were open, and the shape was there. It was looking at me.

I knew it was looking at me.

I stood there, frozen for a while, staring up at the thing staring at me, wondering if I was losing my mind with the detached amusement that thought always brings me, and then I shook my head to snap myself out of it.

And the thing shook its head too.

It shook its head like I had shaken mine, black hair swaying a little, and I felt oddly sick. I don't know why. That deer in the headlights feeling was more of a mouse in the lights of semi truck-strong, and I felt... calm. I know that doesnt make sense with everything else I'm telling you here, but it’s what I felt. Something had gone still inside of me. Completely still, and... empty. It crept into me, like a foreign force, like something outside of me, winding its tendrils from the dark and into my body. It wasn't mine. It came from the House.

I walked up a step. I walked another step. Until I was pressed against the gate, against the unusually tall rails that looked almost like prison bars in the shadows, until my hands were pressed against them and I tried my hardest to squint. To see. It was useless. 

There was no light. There was no light at all, and there was none coming from the streetlights that were too far away, or the house up the road that was closest, and it didn't reach here and that wasn't why I could see the shape. I dont know why I thought that was why I could see it the night before, I dont know why I thought that when the light was coming from behind it, only the light wasn’t light, it was more an absence of dark, just slightly lesser than the dark of the rest of that fucking damned place, and I could see the shape because

because it wanted me to see it.

I tilted my head, trying to make sense of it.

It tilted its head. 

At the same time.

No latency.

I ran.

There's no way around it, I hightailed out if there was something chasing me. I'm not a complete moron, there's still some survival skills left in me, rusty as they may be. I ran all the way home, up the stairs and slammed the door behind me, gasping for air against it. My lungs spasmed, and I had a stitch in my side. *I should really stop smoking*, I thought. Yeah, no shit, I hear you say. It's been a bad habit since my teens, and none of life since has exactly prepared me to let go of it. This did, though. This finally felt like a large enough reason to abstain.

I did all the things I said I would do the night before. I cooked, I cleaned, and I called my friend. She seemed far away in that way she always is, but she was glad to hear from me. She let me rattle on about my job and how awful I found it really, in my heart of hearts, and the new apartment that makes it all worth it, makes me feel like a new person. Someone decent and respectable and all those things I told myself once that I didn't need, but secretly craved somewhere inside all along.

It was good to speak to her, good to laugh a little about stupid things. She did seem better, I could hear it in her voice and the way she spoke about the new succulents she had just bought, about how she looked forward to the coming spring and how it would bring with it some much needed sunshine. I hope she stays that way. I hope she stays clean this time.

I stayed away from any mention of the House, pushing it down to the deepest recesses of my mind, where it laid festering like an infected wound all the same. I remained in some strange way frozen all day, having a hard time making any simple decisions, from how to fold the laundry to what to drink in the evening. Coffee or tea? Coffee would keep me up, give me energy for the night. It wouldn’t let me sleep, though, and I knew I needed rest more than anything.

I chose coffee, and already then I must have known. The whole day had been a state of denial. Each task I set up for myself was another way to bargain, to plead for one more moment of normalcy before the inevitable came. 

I knew I was going back
