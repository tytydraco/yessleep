“Do you see that girl over there?” my best friend Sadie asked. 

*You’re already sick of me?* Was the first notion that entered my head. Why don’t you ignore the npcs and *focus on me for a sec?*

I followed Sadie’s autumn green eyes until I noticed a girl wearing a hospital gown in the middle of the busy street. 

“I think I know her,” I said, without pause.

*She looks terrible.* The words floated in and out of my head. *Like somebody starved her. This isn’t our problem. We should walk away.* 

I recognized her from our childhood, though apparently, her hair had been bleached white, and her skin bore tattoos, or rather surgery markings like stitches encircling her limbs and joints. The most eerie design being dots wrapping around her mouth and the back of her head.

Her cold aqua irises met my gaze, and it was like I sat in an ice bath. 

“John Murlock killed me,” she rasped, her words hanging in the air. Then she vanished, dissolving into the wind like a pile of sand scattered by a gust.

Sadie nearly jumped out of her skin beside me.

“Oh my god, oh my god, what the eff. You saw that, tell me you saw that. She was a ghost, a real life ghost. You recognized her?”

I cleared my throat, my head filling up with a fog.

“F-foster care,” I said. “Her name was Chelsea, but she was adopted before me.”

“Holy crap, Erika, you heard her. She said someone murdered her.” Bet your bomber jacket she wants us to figure out her mystery-”

“No,” I snapped, cutting her off. “No, you can’t have my jacket and you can’t jump to conclusions like that.”

“Ohhhh, come on,” Sadie whined, and I forced us to continue on our path.

*Why did I shut her down like that?* I thought. *It’s this chill, I can’t shake it.*

Sadie wouldn’t let it go, but suddenly it was like I got my best friend back. We texted every minute, and not just about Chelsea, but after a couple of days of us arguing, we met up again.

“John Murlocke killed me,” we both said when I picked her up at the bus stop. 

“It’s like a song stuck in my head,” I added.

“Exactly like that, and if one thing is certain, we need to find out who John Murlock is,” Sadie said, shaking her finger matter-of-factly.

Once we took our seats at our favorite Starbucks, Sadie delved into her bag and passed me Chelsea’s obituary. However, her last name wasn’t Sadler, like back when I knew her. Her obituary noted she had died in a hospital. 

“I told you she wanted us to help,” Sadie said and crossed her arms.

I sipped down my caramel macchiato and the sweet creamy drink compelled me to lean back in my seat.

*I can hardly remember anything about Chelsea,* I thought. *But if she came to me specifically for help, there has to be an important reason.* 

“Well,” Sadie said and lifted her pinky for a promise. “Tomorrow, let’s link back up and ask around the hospital. She needs us to uncover the truth.”

“You’re right,” I agreed, and our fingers warmed against each other.

A warm nostalgia filled me the rest of the night, as if we were kids again. Despite the strain in our friendship since junior year began, playing detective and making pinky promises made it feel like the old days.

When morning came, we hurried to the hospital. Sadie rushed to the information desk with a picture of Chelsea in her hand. The sterile odor of the hospital and the soft hum of distant conversations filled the air. Nearby, I could hear the faint sound of a child’s distress, making me cringe. A doctor apparently noticed and approached me with a grin full of small teeth and eyes that glinted behind his glasses.

“Cute young girls like you should smile more,” he said with a wink. 

I glanced away and noticed Chelsea’s ghost had appeared in the waiting room, her eyes burning with a mix of bloodlust and hatred as she fixed her gaze on a doctor.

*This dude is a total creep,* I told myself. *He is exactly like the freaks at the grocery store grandma told me to watch out for. What are the odds he goes away if I pretend I can’t see him?*

A nurse approached us in a huff: “Doctor Murlock, we need you in the ER.” The doctor barely acknowledged her, his expression remaining indifferent and his eyes barely shifted from me as he turned and walked away. His footsteps faded down the hallway, leaving an unsettling silence in their wake.

“Sadie,” I snapped, getting her attention. “Base, now.”

Sadie’s brow furrowed, but she pocketed her photo and dismissed herself from the front desk.

I used the last of my allowance to buy us both a coffee and stared down into my sugar and fat filled drink while explaining to her what I learned.

“This is… a little above our pay grade,” Sadie said, and shivered. “We should, like, tell the police or a private investigator or something. This dude is a creep.”

“Yeah, totally calling it off seems right. There’s this chill I can't pinpoint. Like-”

Chelsea’s ghost materialized. Her spectral form rested a cold, translucent hand on the table. Then, with a *zzzing* of metal slicing through air, she severed her own hand with a large meat cleaver, leaving us covering our mouths, a squeak escaping from my lips. The other cafe goers barely played us any mind, obviously unable to detect the metallic stench, nor see Chelsea’s ghastly expression.

Sadie turned a pale shade of green. She dashed out of the Starbucks and left her free salted caramel latte untouched, barely making it to the sidewalk before unleashing a spew of vomiting. 

*Chelsea seems different, not scared.* I thought to myself, Sadie’s retching echoed off the nearby buildings, and I patted her back. *That didn’t seem like she was frustrated, more like, she was threatening us.*

“Erika, I’m so scared,” Sadie said, gazing up with teary eyes. 

“I know, me too.” I said.

We didn’t split up after that. Her parents were surprised but agreed to let us have a sleepover, even though it had been a long time since we’d stayed over. They trusted me more than Sadie’s other friends, so had no issue with me staying out late for dinner and a movie, leaving us alone. 

“Sadie, can’t you make them stay home?” I begged.

“No way,” she said, biting her lip. “That would be like the most suspicious thing ever. We just have to pretend everything’s normal and not freak out.”

“But what if Chelsea comes back?” I pleaded.

“Just don’t freak out, okay? I have an idea.”

After her parents left, our focus shifted from finding Chelsea’s killer to trying to protect ourselves. Sadie pulled out her parents’ salt and made us a circle while we looked for exorcism options online. 

“Oh, this is good,” Sadie said giggling, “We can dress up in old ceremonial gowns and do karaoke. Your singing is so bad it’ll probably scare the spirit away.”

“Shut up,” I said and playfully slapped her thigh. We both giggled—then power suddenly shut off.

We left the safety of our salt circle and rushed outside. Darkness had engulfed the entire city block.

“This isn’t what we think it is,” I immediately said. “It’s a rolling blackout. I’ve had like three already at my house this summer.”

“Y-yeah, me too,” Sadie agreed. 

Sadie found two blue candles and lit them in the kitchen. Their soft, flickering glow cast eerie shadows on the walls, and the faint scent of the ocean filled the room. As we settled into the dim light, I cleared my throat.

“It’s nice to hang out again, though. We haven’t had a sleepover in like a year.”

Sadie nodded her head, as if agreeing, but then pointed to the sky blue candles.

“This color is exactly like her eyes,” Sadie said, her voice barely above a whisper. The gentle flicker of the flames, casting a soothing, rhythmic crackle.

When I turned away from her, I saw the photo of Chelsea on the floor and cringed.

*Just like Sadie, trying to scare me so badly I pee my pants.*

“Why did you bring that back out?” I said, rolling my eyes.

“I didn’t,” she replied and went to pick it up.

Sadie reached down, her voice trailing off as she turned the photo over. The salty sea breeze scent of the candle lingered in the air. 

Chelsea’s face within the photo had been so badly scratched out that it was impossible to discern her identity. 

“Oh this is so messed up, even for you.”

“Erika are you crazy, I would never do that-” she paused and gave her head a tilt. “And what do you mean even for me?”

“I swear Sadie, if you’re pranking me right now I will never talk to you again.”

Sadie pursed her lips. 

“Funny, didn’t I say those same words to you, I dunno, about a year ago bitch?”

A knock beside us made me grow pale, I glanced over Sadie’s shoulder.

Chelsea burst out of the kitchen cupboard with a scream so gut wrenching that it froze me like a statue. The pieces of her spectral presence seemed to disappear and reappear, as if shifting between the spirit and physical realms. Her feet slapped loudly against the floor as she rushed toward me. 

*She is going to kill us. All I wanted was to help her and now she was going to murder us.*

She swung her ghostly cleaver down, and I raised my hand out of nothing but desperate reflex. The blade plunged into my flesh, the sensation like gripping a white-hot knife straight from the oven. A dull thud shut up my cry out as Sadie hit Chelsea over the head with a large cookbook.

Sadie turned to run, and Chelsea lunged for her, grabbing her by the hair and yanking her down to the ground. 

“No! God, please help me!” Sadie cried, and her shoes scraped against the floor. Still paralyzed with fear, I reached my bloodied and throbbing hand toward them.

“Why are you doing this?” I screamed at Chelsea. “We want to help.”

“No!” Chelsea spat, more animal than human. “Kill John Murlock.”

“That’s insane,” I said, grimacing as I gripped my maimed hand. “We can tell the police how are we-”

“KILL JOHN MURLOCK, or die!” Chelsea shrieked. 

“Why can’t you just let it go? You’re already dead Chelsea!”

She brandished her cleaver menacingly, its blade glinting in the dim light, poised as if she intended to slit Sadie’s throat. I could taste the acrid, metallic bite of genuine fear pallid on my tongue.

“If you hurt Sadie, then I won’t be able to do anything. They’ll lock me up and call me crazy. No one would believe me about you.”

Chelsea’s piercing blue eyes held only a cold, animalistic intensity, reminiscent of a panting dog left in the sun. She reached down and seized Sadie’s hand, pressing it forcefully against the hard wooden floor. Despite her struggles, the growl that escaped Chelsea’s lips was enough to make Sadie yield, her resistance faltering.

“Kill John Murlock, or die,” she repeated and brought the knife down, chopping Sadie’s index finger down to the knuckle.

Sadie’s scream pierced the air, and I joined her in a desperate cry of terror, but I couldn’t bring myself to leave her side. As I took a step closer, Chelsea raised the knife high and brought it down again with a sickening thud, slicing through the air and severing another of Sadie’s fingers. The blade glinted menacingly in the dim light.

“Please, stop this!” I shouted.

“Kill John Murlock.” Chelsea barked.

*I should have ignored her.* The desperate thoughts raced through my mind. *My life was better after foster care. I should have just moved on and not said I’d known her. None of this would have happened.*

“We’ll do it! We will kill him!” Sadie whimpered. “Please, no more.”

Chelsea’s eyes met mine, and I lost all rational thought in her maddening glare.

“Yes, we will do it. I’m sorry. We will kill him,” I confirmed.

“Good,” Chelsea croaked. She showed me a smile full of rotten brown teeth, and I knew that my life was [over.](https://youtu.be/2ZB0m3pW8iI)
