it was 9pm on a rainy saturday night, i got into a fight with my boyfriend Jack. After arguing back and forth for a an hour, i decided i have had enough and got up grabbing my car keys on my way out of the apartment. 



I hurried to my car while the rain was pouring down on me. I managed to get in my car without being completely soaked. I turned the car on and started driving, without knowing where i am going. I decided to go on long drive through a fairly secluded road to calm my mind without having other people driving or honking around me. i wanted peace and silence, i wanted to relax. 



I was feeling much better just 10 minutes into the drive, when i thought i saw a kid walking on the side of the road. i squinted my eyes, trying to see better. It for sure looked like a little kid with his back turned towards my car. I was confused, why would a literal kid be here walking on the side of such a secluded road with nothing for miles, that too on a rainy night at 10pm. 



When i got closer to the kid, i started slowing down. It was a little boy, maybe a 7 or 8 year old. "Hey kid! are you okay? Do you need any help? where are your parents?", i called out. The boy turned around drenched in rain, his skin as pale as a ghost, eyes sunken in, hollow cheeks with wide open eyes. He looked pretty frail. "Are you okay? where are you going?", i said.



The kid showed no emotion, he didnt reply any of my questions, just looked at me with his wide eyes. There was something wrong with him, i couldnt put my finger on it, but there was something strange about him.



I asked again, " Do you need a ride? you want me to take you somewhere? to your parents maybe?". After a few seconds, he finally nodded and started slowly heading towards my car. i opened the door and held it open for him to get in. He looked painfully cold. i had an extra coat on my back seat, so i grabbed it, offering it to the boy to wear. He took it and started putting it on. It was obviously too big for him but he needed something warm to wear.



"So where do you need to go? and why are you alone on the road at this time?", i asked. He offered no explanation and quietly said, " Down the road". I was confused, but decided against questioning him any further and started to drive down the long empty road. I tried to ask him if he need anything else, if he needs to call somebody but he just ignored all my questions and didnt reply.



A few minutes into the drive, he started acting weirdly, yawning and opening is mouth way too wide, nearly impossible for an adult let alone a kid. He started fidgeting wiith his fingers, and when i looked at his hands, they umm they looked out of proportion, the palms were way too small and the fingers way too long. His index finger must have been 6 inches long and that was not normal at all. 



i started feeling nervous and to be honest scared. I picked up a kid walking down a secluded road on a rainy night all alone. He is in my car now, and yeah a kid cannot possibly hurt me or something but it felt way too weird and scary for some reason. While i was submerged in my horrifying thoughts, he tilted his head slightly to look at me, i asked him if he wants to talk now but he just stared at me not saying anything. He kept staring at me for what felt like forever but probably would have just been 2 minutes. 



He finally started opening his mouth to talk, i looked at him as he opened his mouth, his teeth were extremely sharp, too sharp for a human, he spoke, " i am not what you think, i'm sorry". For a moment i felt like, i couldnt breath, but then i tried to think of it as a silly joke and asked, "What are you then? are you not a kid? what's your age? 8?", letting out a laugh.



 He nodded his head no, and spoke, " i'm 89". i laughed it off, telling him he's a naughty kid and i love naughty kids, my nephew is an extremly naught kid and says things like that. 



He looked at me and said with a stern tone, "i'm not a kid!". At this point i was sure i've put myself in a dangerous situation and i'm gonna have to pay for it somehow. i should have called the police and have them deal with this, i thought to myself. 



The boy started reaching into his pocket and pulled out something looking like an old sac, it looked impossibly big to fit into his little pocket. He reached into the sac and pulled out something looking like little spherical chocolate chunks with something golden scattered in it. i looked at him confused. " Thankyou for helping me, its for you", the boy said.



i didnt know what to do, so i stretched my left hand out and he placed the tiny spherical things on my hand. Not knowing what to do with them, i put them into my coat pocket, smiling weirdly at the boy and thanking him. He then started to close his eyes while whispering something to himself. At this point, i was just ready to drive through this freaking road and when the road ends, return this kid to his parents maybe of to somebody he knows, and just go back home, cuddle my bf to sleep. i couldnt wait to get out of there.



The boy slowly started talking again, "You dont know what you are getting yourself into yet". He sighed, " You have to keep driving until you can, this road won't end anytime soon but you have to keep going, i have been walking down this road for 5 years now and you are the first person to be able to see me, and now that you have seen me and taken me in, you have to keep going with me, just like i have been going since 5 years now, the end is near not too far". 



It felt like my heart was coming up my throat, my stomach clenched, my palms getting sweatier and my brain freezing. i looked at the boy and he looked serious, he didnt look like an innocent child fooling around,no not at all. He looked like a wise person, who has seen and experienced alot and who knows what he's doing and talking about. 



"What do you mean, how long do i have to keep going before this road ends?", i asked. He looked at me with a sympathetic expression, "A long time, a couple of years maybe".



i started feeling dizzy and felt like i need to throw up when the boy said, " i have an offer for you, you get to choose, you can either drive and take me to my destination, which will take no less then 2 years and then you can go back to where you came from or you can accompany me in a ritual that will make everything easier for us, but i need your participation in it."
