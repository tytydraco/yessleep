 To protect my family members some facts surround the story will be changed, but the location is going to stay the same.

Back in 1991 my Grandma Bea was a Mexican American, single mother, and extremely successful realtor in the Bay Area, and owned a home in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in San Jose. What I am about to tell you may sound like something straight out of a horror movie but has been collaborated by multiple unbiased witnesses who were present that night causing me to never forget and constantly be haunted by this story.

  While my Grandma Bea's children (my Father (Tim), two aunts (Ashley & Alicia , and Uncle (Shane)) were in their later teen years my Grandmother hired a maid named Elva to help around the house with cleaning.

 By all accounts Elva was hard working and drop dead gorgeous, with glowing tan skin, big brown eyes and beautiful hair that flowed to her waist . Elva came to California with her parents from a small town in Jalisco Mexico as a young child. Both Elva's parents were workers in nearby agricultural farms. At 16 years old Elva reached out to an ad my grandmother put in a newspaper for a maid and began working shortly after. Elva was with my grandmother for 10 years before everything happened and had went from being a weekly cleaner to a live in maid. Elva looked up to my Grandmother for her independence and how she came from nothing to being an extremely successful Latina realtor and owning a home in such a renown majority white neighborhood. 

 As the years passed and Bea's adult children began to move out and start their own lives, Elva remained by her side, maintaining the luxurious five bedroom home and absorbing everything she could about finding success in the realtor business. Bea and Elva became fairly close. Bea learned all about Elva's life and how her Grandparents owned large lots of land in their hometown and how Elva's grandfather favored her Aunt Agnes over her mother leaving her to inherit all the land and Elva's mother with nothing. Agnes sold all land the minute Elva's grandparents passed away and divided nothing with Elva's mother. Using her new found wealth, Agnes bought a large home two streets down from Bea's for herself and her charismatic husband Lee, using Bea as her realtor after being referred to her by Elva.

  Although Elva's mother wanted nothing to do with Agnes, Elva and her Aunt maintained a relationship having weekly visits and an occasional lunch. Agnes looked strikingly similar to Elva which Lee never failed to point out, making her a very beautiful woman for her age. 

 With Bea's children no longer living in the house, the workload lessened for Elva, leaving her more time for herself. Elva would finish her cleaning early and study with the help of Bea in the afternoons in hopes of obtaining her realtor license. Bea was anything but oblivious and was very aware of her surrounding - a trait she picked up in her years of being a single mother to four sneaky teenagers.

 Bea would notice Elva getting ready nightly and walking out to a dark vehicle very similar to the car that Agnes' husband Lee drove. Elva would return hours later and resort to her room. Bea was very suspicious of this but kept her thoughts to herself. That is, until Elva broke down to her month later about expecting a baby. Bea expressed her suspicion and questioned Elva about who the baby's father was, which Elva would not reveal. 

 Bea allowed Elva to stay in her home throughout her pregnancy, and agreed to let her stay after so long as she continued with their agreed lists of duties to maintain the home regardless of the gut wrenching suspicious that her beautiful, hardworking maid was indeed having a full on affair with her Aunt's husband Lee.

 Elva delivered a beautiful baby boy who she doted over. Bea was stunned at what an excellent mother Elva had become virtually overnight and found joy in watching her young maid with her beautiful baby boy find solace in her home. The joy was short lived when one day Bea was working on listings when the most blood curdling scream she ever heard rock through the home. She rushed out of her office to find Elva desperately trying to wake up her baby boy, hollering for Bea to call an ambulance. Ice cold shock ran down Bea's spine as she fumbled the land line in her hand.

 Elva's baby boy died that day from SIDs. As the ambulance worked on the baby, Bea couldn't take her eyes off his blue lips. Bea tried to console Elva but it was impossible. The next few days felt like months as darkness filled Bea's home. Bea would listen to Elva curse God daily and ask how he could take her baby.

 A month after the baby passed away in an attempt to get Elva's mind off of everything Bea offered to take her with her to her son Tim's home in Lake Tulloch for a family gathering. The drive up was uneventful for the most part, lots of silence aside from occasional comments from Bea's 20 year old daughter Alicia and her friend Dee who had come along as well about how beautiful the ride was. 

 All of Bea's children were at the gathering at her oldest son Tim's home including Tim's wife Angie, their two daughters, as well Bea's daughter Ashley's two daughters. As darkness took over the sunny day Elva remained withdrawn and silent sitting in a chair gazing out a window in the corner of Tim and Angie's large living room. At one point Bea was looking for dollar bills to pass to her granddaughters and asked that Alicia's friend Dee go out to her car to grab her purse. 

 Dee walked out the door and shivered as she wrapped her jean jacket around her stepping into the cold air. She walked down the driveway and up to the car when she instantly froze. In the backseat of Bea's car was a baby. Blueness was creeping into his skin as the baby gasped for air. Dee screamed at the top of her lungs that their was a baby in the backseat of the car. In the blink of an eye she opened the door and the baby was gone. Bea's son Shane  was already running down the steps of the house by the time she turned her head. Simultaneously a bloodcurdling howl ripped through the house and out the front door.

 Inside the house Elva was now standing staring directing at Bea. The room began to shake as windows rattle in their frame. Elva's eyes turned into a black haze as her face contorted and she began speaking. She kept repeating in a deep whisper that she wanted Bea and planned to "take her with her". Tim's wife scooped up all the children and ran to a back room stacking furniture up against the door. Bea's children all ran towards Elva as she grabbed a marble coffee table  that took three men to move into the home and threw it across the room effortlessly. Tim and Shane grabbed Elva by the arms trying to restrain her as she held her gaze on Bea. Alicia slapped Elva across the face in an attempt to snap her out of it, when all of sudden her eyes rolled to the back of her head and she collapsed. Bea's sons did everything they could to revive her and continued CPR until an ambulance arrived. Elva died 3 days later in the hospital. 

 After that day everything in my Grandmother's life began to go downhill. Her successful days as a realtor came to an end and she was no longer able to obtain or hold clients. The once beautiful home was filled with an undeniable evil presence that everyone who entered notice. Doors would open and close on their own, things would go missing, every one who slept in the home felt as if they were being watched, and late at night you would hear the baby's cries rip through the house. My Grandmother ended up loosing her home as weird events continued to plague her life. To this day my Grandmother will not speak about the events that took place that day

 I still wonder about my Grandmother's home and the evilness that was housed within conceived from a mother's grief in loosing her child. I wonder if the people who own the home now experience even a fraction of the pure terror that house brought to my family for decades.
