It's been a week now and I don't know if I should call the police or leave it be. 

Last Saturday my boyfriend, 18yo male, me, 20yo female, made the mistake of venturing out too far for date night. Date night lately has meant visiting nature and various parks. We try to go to a new one each time to ensure it's always an adventure. We usually reminisce, take pictures, and enjoy the scenery. It's especially great for when it's warm out. Nothing beats the sound of frogs singing a lullaby as you walk through the woods.

When we got to the park, my boyfriend was so giddy to show me around. This was the spot He and his dad used to go fishing. It was one of many spots their family frequented. Because of that I think I'll call the park... fish valley. For anonymity of course.

The first thing I noticed about fish valley was how secluded it was. There were open areas and spots to sit down. Plenty of activites to do and plenty of touristy sights to see. The park WAS quite large but throughout our 2 hour excursion I would have expected to see more than like two person. This was definitely odd but it didn't set off alarm bells in my mind just yet.

We walked north admiring the view. Eventually we made it to a bridge under a railroad track. Rocks, cobwebs, and graffiti covered the underside. Above was a set of railroad tracks.
My boyfriend, knowing I love railroads, caught me taking intrest and grabbed me by my wrist. He showed me up to the tracks and my.. was it beautiful. Everything was overgrown. Even more, the further we followed, the prettier and more untouched the land became. 

Out of all the urbex spots we've visited, none have come close the sheer beauty that those tracks divided. I still wish I could've gotten more photos.

By the end of our journey, we made it to a rail junction where three old cargo trains lay in wait. On the left track, one train car and the right, two train cars positioned one in front of the other. It was perfect. Me and my boyfriend scooted between the cars and  held eachother. Man, I love him so much. I broke the moment when nature called. My bladder screamed at me and I set off to find a spot to do my buisness.

So before you come at me, I am a shy peer. I didn't stop on the way despite the obvious lack of people, because I did not want to take the risk. There were bushy areas but nothing that could cover me well enough to give my consciousness the strength to go number 1 in public. Soooo I did what any lady would have done and waited to find a more private area. Dumb idea in retrospect but what can you do.

My plan was to just pop a squat off to the side of the tracks. I took a right tords the bushes and did my thing. On my way back, I stopped. My blood ran cold. My boyfriend trotted over to me where he saw the small campsite. Rocks were laid out In a circle and bright prink laced panties were wrapped across a bed of leaves and grass. 

This got me thinking. What if someone saw me? Then a scarier thought hit me. What if they were still here. 

My man reasured me telling me that the spot looked old. 
When I look back on it, I think he was just saying that so I wouldn't panic.

We covered up the sight and resumed our previous activities. 

As we headed back to the spot between the train cars, I couldn’t shake the unsettling feeling from before. Despite his blind confidence, the once-romantic setting had begun to feel ominous and eerie. Every rustle in the bushes made my heart race. I remember glancing around, each shadow and sound amplifying my anxiety. My boyfriend tried once again to pull me back into the moment but I couldn’t take it anymore.

As we hugged, I begged him to go back. He didn't want to but I could tell he felt my fear. When it was dim, we readied ourselves to make the long journey back.

We hurried towards the bridge, but a nagging feeling made me glance over my shoulder. That’s when I saw him—a disheveled man emerging from the bushes, holding a metal pipe. It was like something out of a horror movie. His eyes were wild, and he moved with a menacing purpose.

My boyfriend still has a bruise from where I grabbed him. I yanked him to my side so hard he practically yelped.

The last thing I rememeber is us sprinting towards the bridge, our footsteps pounding against the dirt path. The man was behind us with the pipe clutched tightly in his hand. For someone so skinny and old, he ran like he was in fighting for an olympic medal. Luckily or not, the adrenaline coursing through my veins was just enough of a match for the old man.

Me and my boyfriend managed to dart under the railroad bridge, the darkness beneath it momentarily swallowing us. The man’s footsteps echoed, growing louder. We headed towards the swampy area of the water, hoping to lose him in the dense underbrush. The air was thick with humidity, making it hard to breathe.

We zigzagged through the trees, the sound of pursuit close behind. My legs burned, and my lungs felt like they were on fire, but stopping wasn’t an option. I glanced back and saw the man still chasing us, his face twisted with determination and madness.

The saving grace was my boyfriend spotting a narrow path leading back to the park entrance. We bolted towards it, the trees closing in around us. Branches scratched at our skin, and the undergrowth tangled around our feet, but we didn’t dare slow down.

As we burst out onto the main path, we practically collapsed in the grass. The man was no where to be seen. We made it. We were safe but not unharmed. Cuts and bruises heal but the memory of that night haunts me. I can't get his eyes out if my mind. 

I know it was illegal to trespass onto those tracks and that was our first mistake but a part of me wants to know what that man was doing out there in the first place. Was he the reason why it was so quiet? And why did he have that pipe.

My mind has been filling in the blanks for me lately. I wish I could forget this incident.
