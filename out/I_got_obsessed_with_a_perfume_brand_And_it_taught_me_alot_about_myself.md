When I was little, I used to mix random perfumes like potions. My cousin would scare me with,

“If you inhale too much perfume, you’ll go crazy. Your lungs will rot.” He loved seeing me scared. My sister always scolded him for it.

I avoided perfumes for a while after that.

By the time I’m hit late teens, it didn't ’t really affect me. I mean—who goes crazy from a scent?

...Well, considering the human mind, I guess there’s always a chance.

But I was okay. 

Really... 

I work part-time in a department store—mostly in the men’s fragrance section. I was never into perfumes. But there was this one glass bottle Unisex perfume I liked.

A slim glass bottle with fresh maroon liquid inside. It smelled so good I couldn’t get enough. The manager scolded me for wasting the tester all the time.

One time, while sneaking a spray from a nearly empty bottle she was about to toss, she caught me. I panicked and dropped it, the glass shattered and scattered across the floor.

“Alex! Stop sneaking the products—even if they’re unsellable. Now clean up!”

She left me alone. I swept up the shards, and in the middle of it, I cut my finger.

The red bloomed instantly.

And for a moment… I don't know why but I brought it to my lips.

“ALEX! Stop taking the whole day to clean!”

I flinched as she yelled again. I was surprised she didn’t kick me out. But I was pretty good at people-pleasing technique. 

One night, I had to cover the night shift. Not usually allowed for juniors or part timer, but the senior in charge was sick. The store would close at midnight. Just a few hours.

No customers. No noise. 

Just me and the products.

I tried not to think about the perfume.

But it was addictive.

I opened the new tester. Sprayed my wrist. Inhaled.

It was too good I got distracted. 

“Enjoying yourself, I see?”

I jumped. A man stood in the aisle. I flushed, embarrassed.

“I—I uh… sorry! How may I help you, sir?” I slapped on my professional mask, straightened my posture with a smile on my face.

He chuckled and picked up that bottle of same brand I liked.

“This one.”

I nodded. It wasn’t cheap, but not luxury either. Good smell. But Strangely, customers never liked it much.

“You love the perfume too?” he asked, smiling.

“Well… it’s addictive.”

He laughed.

“So… you’re one of us?”

He sprayed the perfume—on his neck, never looking away from me.

“What do you mean?” I asked, confused at the sudden question.

“You enjoy the taste of human flesh too, right?”

I stared at him.

“...What?”

“This perfume,” he said, breathing deep, “is made for certain people. With donated human blood. Not everyone likes the flavor. But for us... it’s heaven.”

His pinprick eyes were locked on mine. 

His lips stretched unnaturally wide. A row of white teeth showed, his eyes started to open wider.

“So... do you eat your kin? Others or.... yourself?”

Since that night, I stopped wearing perfume. I reported about the perfume to my manager. She transferred to the clothing section.


Because I don’t want to go insane.
