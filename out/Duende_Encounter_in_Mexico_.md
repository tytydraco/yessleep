So this isn't my story as I grew up in United States but my cousin from Mexico came to live with us for a while. This is his personal encounter.

I'm not a story teller so sorry if this is all over the place.

So growing up in a Mexican household and Hispanic friends, I’ve heard all types of stories. However, as I know my cousin and his family and how they are, I 100% believe this. My mom’s sister does not fuck around and is one of the most serious people I know. Alright so my cousin, let’s call him “Jose” who is only a year older than me, 26 now, grew up in a town outside of Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, this is where my family is from. He lived in his house along with his parents, older brother, and two older sisters. As he was the youngest, he was the baby of the family, therefore he didn’t know what “no” meant when it came to food, pretty much he was a very overweight kid growing up. 

When he was around 8, he and his siblings would all sleep in the same room as the house only had two rooms at the time. Over the years, his parents have added areas and rooms to the house so it’s still the same house to this day, only much bigger. 

He recalls that during this period he was always extremely fatigued. He would sleep a lot and still wake up feeling exhausted and irritable. He never thought too much into this as again, he was very overweight and figured he was so drained because of that. However, when his siblings would get up at night to go to the bathroom or get water, they would tell him they would see a duende sleeping on his chest, best way to describe it is a small brown goblinlike creature.

Now anyone would freak out if they saw this right? I know I would..but nope, apparently this is super common to happen in Mexico in other latin american countries. Not only would his siblings see this, but also his parents. Of course, they would do all the religious stuff such as prayers and cleanses to keep the duende away. After my cousin told his parents how he was feeling and his siblings confirming what they saw, they took my cousin to a curandera, a healer in town, whom confirmed that the duende was draining my cousin of his energy, not necessarily maliciously, but more so because he was the youngest in the house. They did quite a few cleanses and rituals and soon after the duende no longer slept on him. However, they say he still shows up at the house to this day.

“Jose” also told me that there’s a picture out there at some family member’s house in Mexico, and apparently my own mother whom is a very honest women, has seen this picture, that shows my cousin and his family standing in front of their house, and you can see the duende at one of the windows in the background. If I ever see this picture when I go visit I will make sure I take a picture and post it!

Still so crazy to me. Now the most recent encounter gave me chills! This happened about 2 years ago. My cousin’s older sister “Ana” has a 6 year old daughter who at the time was 4 years old. Now my aunt being the intense serious woman that she is, forbid any of her kids, whom are all grown adults between the ages of 33-26 but again the woman is scary lol, to tell the grandkids about the duende so they wouldn’t be scared to go over to their house. Well, my cousin Ana, sent a video of the family groupchat of her daughter crying and explaining to her that she went to my cousin “Jose’s” old room and described an “ugly brown monster man” sleeping in the bed. I saw this video myself with my mom and we were in such shock that this happened. No one has ever told her about the duende and yet she described exactly what everyone else had seen. There’s a few other sightings that’s happened over the years by them but just things like seeing this thing sleeping or running by. 

I’ve never visited my hometown but when I do I definitely will be in full monster hunter mode in my aunts house trying to take a picture of this thing lol! It’s so crazy to me but according to my family and other hispanic friends who grew up in their own countries, things like this along with ghost and witch stories are all but too common over there. 

Now I don’t need any asshole commenting how this is fake, this is my family so I’ll be quick to delete this post if it gets any negative comments, I just thought it would be cool to share as it still blows my mind too lol.
