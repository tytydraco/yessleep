I could see my breath as we walked, the yellow glow of the street lights illuminating the sidewalk, the small grassy front yards of the neighborhood, the brown and golden leaves that collected on the ground. The brisk air smelled of smoke from wood stoves.

Katie had her hand in mine, our fingers intertwined as we walked, our footsteps gently echoing off the walls of the old colonials on our leafy street. 

“I was thinking,” she said, “since you have your vacation week coming up, maybe we can go to Los Angeles for a few days? A change of scenery might be good for you.”

I scoffed.

“Do you know how much that would cost? The hotel? A rental car? Food? The plane tickets?”

“It was just an idea, I thought maybe it’d be nice to—“

“Seriously? You’re seriously going to suggest this? When you don’t even have a job?”

“Sorry, just an idea, that’s all.” 

I felt a cold pinprick on my left arm, then a searing needle-like pain. 

“Fuck!”

I swatted at whatever it was on my arm, and a wasp, about an inch long, it’s yellow and black banded body, fell to the sidewalk and flitted around like one of those old fashioned wind up toys. I stomped on the wasp, its body giving way under my shoe with a crunch.

“Fucking piece of shit stung me!”

I stomped on the flattened, lifeless insect again, and again, and again, then wiped my shoe off on the ground, seeing its entrails and bits of leg and antenna entangled in the grass. 

“Are you okay?” Katie looked concerned, her eyes meeting mine, then looking at the reddish welt on my arm. 

I didn’t respond and started marching back in the direction of our house. Back inside, Katie helped me put ointment and a bandaid on the sting site, and gave it a gentle kiss.

A week had passed and I had forgotten about the run-in with the wasp. 

I got home from work around the usual time. I didn’t have much time at work to eat, so I often forewent my meals and just waited until I got home. I kicked off my boots, changed out of uniform, and headed into the kitchen. Katie was on the sofa in the adjacent room, her head buried in a notebook, scribbling away. The kitchen table was empty.

“Where’s dinner?”

“Sorry babe. I got busy with my writing and lost track of time so I didn’t make us anything. I think we still have some leftovers in the fridge though.”

“Are you fucking serious? I work twelve hours a day, six days a week to pay for this place while you sit on your ass at home playing make believe starving artist, and you couldn’t even be bothered to do one simple thing?”

“I’m sorry baby I—“

“You’re sorry?!”

I launched one of the kitchen chairs across the room. It struck the stainless steel fridge door, leaving a small dent. 

“Great, now I have to pay for THAT too!”

“I’m really sorry. Let me make something for you right now.” 

“Oh! Now you care?! Fuck it, too little, too late. I’ll just starve and go to bed!”

Something whooshed by my left ear. It sounded like a horsefly, but louder; that buzzing, electric clipper-like drone made my neck hairs stand up. Something cold landed on the back of my neck, followed by searing pain. I instinctively swatted at it. The yellow and black blur zipped by my head and flew across the room. 

I looked up at the ceiling light and saw three more wasps circling. They then turned almost in unison and swooped down at me. I ducked and ran out of the kitchen. 

“What the fuck?!”

I looked to the living room window, and saw several wasps squeezing their way through a gap between the upper and lower sashes. I looked around the room for something, anything, to swat them with. I grabbed a magazine off the coffee table and rolled it up. I felt a stabbing pain on my arm as another wasp dive-bombed its stinger into my skin.

“Babe, no! If you swat them, they’ll release pheromones and alert the others!” 

“Well what the fuck do you expect me to do?!”

Katie looked around the room, at the window, at the light fixture where more and more of the wasps were circling. There were at least a dozen of them by now. She opened the closet door and grabbed the vacuum cleaner, and quickly separated the hose attachment from the canister body. She put the crevice tool on the end of the hose and handed it to me. 

“Tell me when and I’ll turn it on!”

I positioned the vacuum hose and shouted, “now!” She turned the vacuum cleaner on, and I started vacuuming up the little fuckers, catching them mid flight in the vacuum stream, sending their little bodies hurtling inside the hose, their hard exoskeletons bouncing around in the tube. I positioned the vacuum tool over the sash and sucked up at least another twenty or so, then pushed the lower sash down until it seated properly, closing off the gap. Outside on the window, dozens of wasps gathered, their angry droning, their beating wings and clawing feet creating a pitter patter against the glass like demonic rainfall. And then, just as quickly as they had arrived, they left, nearly all at once. Katie and I just stared at each other.

I was exhausted at work the next day. One of my coworkers sat down across from me on one of the benches in the break room, and must’ve noticed my annoyed look when I peered up from my phone.

“Hey, sorry, mind if I sit here?”

I shrugged.

“How’ve you been, man? he asked. “It’s been a while since I’ve seen you. I just bid onto a night run a few weeks ago.”

“Good, you?” I answered, barely taking my eyes off my phone as I scrolled picture after picture of hot chicks on Instagram. 

“Well, it’s been a rough few days. My train hit somebody last week, and I just got back from my mental health days. They had a counselor call to check in on me, the whole crew actually, to see how we were doing. It helped to talk about it, but—”

“What do you know about wasps?” I interjected.

He paused for a moment and looked at me.

“What do you mean?”

“You know, like the bugs. Bzzzzz.”

“I did have a wasp nest over my patio last summer. I ended up calling an exterminator to come take care of it.”

“You still have their number?”

“Yeah, I can send it to you.” He took out his phone and texted me. My phone buzzed.

I stepped outside into the cool autumn air, and clicked on the number. 

“Good afternoon, New England Pest Control.”

“Hi, I’m having a wasp problem at my house and wanted to get a quote for your services.”

“Wasps? We don’t usually get much call for those this time of year. What’s going on?”

I explained what had happened, the swarm of wasps that came in the night, and how aggressive and angry they were. 

“That’s interesting,” he replied, “the wasp species we have here don’t usually come out at night, and especially not this late in the season. Most of them have already either died off or gone into hibernation. I suppose it could be a new invasive species we don’t know about, or you could have a nest in a crawl space or inside your walls. I would have to come by to take a look.”

“Okay, can you come tomorrow morning?”

“I’m afraid I’m booked out until next week. It’s rodent season now, what with the weather getting colder, people are finding mice getting into their cellars or attics to stay warm. Anyway, if you want to give me your name and number, I can—”

I hung up.

—

The kitchen was warm and bright when I got home. Something smelled really good. I kicked off my boots, and sat down at the kitchen table. A pair of plates along with two sets of utensils and wine glasses adorned the tabletop. Katie came in and kissed me on the forehead. 

“How was work today?”

I shrugged.

“I made us some manicotti tonight, I know it’s your favorite,” she said as she donned oven mitts and pulled the baking dish out of the oven. The aroma of marinara sauce and ricotta filled the kitchen. 

“I have some good news,” Katie said as she lifted a forkful of manicotti to her mouth. I looked up from my plate. 

“Remember Sadie? My friend from LA, the screenwriter?” 

I nodded half heartedly. 

“Well, she put in a word for me with her managers. I sent over some of my writing samples and they really liked them! I had a zoom interview with them this morning and they offered me a job!”

“So you’re leaving me to move to LA?”

The smile from Katie’s face disappeared.

“Well not exactly. Yes I would have to move there. But I was hoping maybe you could come with me? It could be a fresh start for the both of us. We could—”

“And what about MY job?! Did you ever stop to think about ME? Are you that FUCKING selfish?” 

Tears started to run down Katie’s cheeks.

“Baby, I love you. I just thought—”

“IF YOU LOVED ME YOU WOULDN’T BE DOING THIS TO ME RIGHT NOW!”

I grabbed my phone off the table and hurled it. It whizzed by Katie’s head and slammed into the wall behind her, making a crumbled hole in the sheetrock. Katie started sobbing.

“YOU’RE SERIOUSLY CRYING?!”

I got up and moved toward Katie, grabbing her hard by the wrist and pulling. She cried out and fell from her chair onto the hardwood floor. I tightened my grip around her wrist and pulled harder.

“YOU STUPID FUCKING TWAT!”

Pitter patter. It sounded like it was starting to rain, but my neck hairs stood on end. I looked to the kitchen window and saw dozens of wasps landing and gathering on the glass outside. Their angry buzzing got louder and louder. A wasp whipped by my head, and I felt a searing pain in my cheek. Another whipped by. And another. I looked at the hole in the wall where my phone had hit, and tens of wasps were spilling out, launching themselves into the air. 

The light fixture above the kitchen table started to rattle, and the fixture fell, crashing down into the pan of manicotti. A massive, writhing swarm rushed out with a deafening buzz, a hellish river of black and yellow. And they made a bee line for me.

I ran upstairs as fast as my feet could carry me, tripping on one of the steps in the process, sending shockwaves of pain through my toes and my left knee which had smashed into the bannister. I half-ran half-crawled into the bathroom and slammed the door shut. The angry, insistent pitter patter on the door sounded like dozens of miniature darts from hell, demanding to be let in. I desperately clawed my pocket for my phone to call 911, only to realize it was still on the kitchen floor.

The wasps started squeezing their way under the bathroom door. They flew at me, piercing me with their stingers. My face, my neck, my arms, I could feel searing, burning pain as the sting sites swelled and reddened. I grabbed a pair of slippers and started swatting every wasp that I could, killing several. I grabbed a bath towel and shoved it in the space under the door, stopping more wasps from entering. I swatted and swatted at the remaining wasps until they were all dead. 

I lifted the blinds on the window to see if I could climb out, only to be met with a writhing mass of wasps on the other side. Outside the door, the angry buzzing grew louder and louder. I screamed until I blacked out. 

—

I woke to sunlight streaming in between the bathroom window blinds. It was silent. I lifted the blinds and could see out into the yard, the neighbor’s beige roof shingles, the trees losing their brown, crisp leaves. I crawled over to the door and pressed my ear to it. Silence. I pulled the towel away and very slowly opened the door. There was no sign of the wasps anywhere. 

I limped downstairs, my face, neck, and arms still feeling like they had been set on fire. I saw Katie on the sofa, curled up into a fetal position. 

“Are you okay?”

She looked up at me, and I noticed she didn’t have a single welt or sting on her. Her wrist was bruised in the shape of finger marks. Her eyes were bloodshot and puffy from crying. 

She wailed.

It was a wail of sorrow and despair, almost like a cornered, hunted animal that knew it was going to die. She slowly buried her face in her knees and sobbed quietly. 

“Let’s talk when I get home?”

I didn’t say anything else. I picked up my phone, its cracked, kaleidoscope screen shimmering in the sunbeam coming through the window. I grabbed my work bag and threw on my boots. I could still hear Katie sobbing as I limped out the door to my truck. 

—

The swelling has gone down a bit by the time I got home that night. I walked into the kitchen and noticed all the lights were off. 

“Katie?”

I flicked on the light switch for the kitchen, forgetting about the broken light fixture. I stumbled blindly into the living room and my heart dropped when I saw what appeared to be a person hanging. I quickly fumbled for the light, and it turned out to just be a shadow. I breathed a sigh of relief. 

That’s when I noticed some stuff in the room was missing. Katie’s acoustic guitar, her MacBook, the mess of notebooks and scrap paper she often had laying about, all gone. I rushed into our bedroom. All of her clothing was gone from our dresser, her make up, toiletries, shoes, all gone. 

I pulled out my phone and fumbled with the fractured screen. I clicked on her number. Straight to voice mail. I sat down on the sofa and stared at the wall. 

The wasps would be back soon. I sat and waited. 

But the wasps never came that night.

They haven’t come back since.
