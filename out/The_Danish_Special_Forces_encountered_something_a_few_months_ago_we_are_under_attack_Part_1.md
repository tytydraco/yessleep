I am a member of the Danish Royal Navy’s Frømandskorpset, more popularly known as the “Danish Frogmen”.

For those of you who are well knowledgeable on international special forces, you’ve probably seen that now famous photo of a fireteam aboard a boat with veils obscuring their faces. That is also probably one of the pieces of information you’ve ever received on us, as my home country’s naval special warfare unit is shrouded in mystery for good reason. We’re NATO’s silent workhorse having followed larger nations and militaries into conflict zones such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and The Balkans, to some places that… aren’t declassified. 

Out of the nearly 600 applicants, the Royal Navy gets for its Frømandskorpset a year, less than a dozen actually make it in, and fewer still are able to give up everything to make this a long-term career. I am one of the few, I have been with the teams for several years and I have found great pride in my service. Above all I have been committed to every aspect of my job, and that includes the vow of silence we take… that is, until today. 

I’ve waged war against men from every corner of the world, state-sanctioned and true believer, terrorist, yet… the fight that shook me to my core wasn’t on some far off battlefield but right here at home. 

For the sake of those I’ve served with, and lost, “codenames” will be used to obscure their identity and mine. I lead a four man team element under a larger squadron, “Codfish” as I’ll call him is our comms man, skilled in being able to obtain and maintain connection no matter the environment, no matter the equipment. For those of you who are in say the American or British militaries, we use the same AN/PRC radio series you guys do, and yes they do suck.  However, Codfish has always been able to make do, which is why I’ve fought so hard to keep him on my team. 

Next is my designated marksman, “Anglerfish”, Frogman teams are commonly used as a reconnaissance element to move ahead of a larger element and act as an early warning or forward guard. Anglerfish is an essential part of that as he utilizes a powerful scope to help detail the path and its terrain around it, along with being able to reach out and touch anyone we need removed. The pipeline for becoming a Danish sniper is one of the most grueling and humbling courses you could take, and it requires a fair amount of calculation, humility, and control- he is all of these things. 

On the other side of the spectrum we have my gunner, “Largemouth”. Any military element assembled needs a suitable amount of firepower in case things go wrong, because they can and almost certainly will. Largemouth is one of the junior guys of my unit, and thus is being given a simple yet important task to maintain: The team’s fire support. 

Despite his inexperience, his ability to maintain rates of fire and ammo count, keep his head down, and do it all under the mission set of a frogman. Then there’s me, “Kraken”, I’ve served with the unit for almost ten years now, experience in 4 official theaters and 2 classified ones. My CO calls me his “Hammer”, the one he sends in to take an objective that is absolutely essential.
  
Okay, now that you’ve got the context on my team, let’s get down to it. In total our complete element was around 12 servicemen, and all of us were ushered into one of the briefing rooms, per usual… However, details were slim to none. It all started with the arrival of that damned fog… it’s not uncommon, this was during the height of the break up season after all. Well into the snow completely thawing and giving way to humidity and rain, with much of the northern marshlands near the north coast experiencing this. 

However… this wasn’t normal, centering around a small village, over the course of three weeks, all communications went from sporadic, to broken… to… nothing. The military wanted to get involved at first, however the government wanted the locals to handle it (leave it to them to let things go from bad to damn fucked). Investigators were sent in, and immediately all contact was lost with them. After several days, only one transmission came from the town before everything went silent: “We’re with her now…. We have no need for our flesh or the outside world. She’s giving us all we need. She’s going to make us… beautiful…” 

Finally, the Royal Army was set loose, and things only got more complicated from there. UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles aka drones) were sent in to try and survey the area… only to find almost the entire area beyond the village was engulfed in a dense fog that a 30 million Krone (4.5 million dollar) drone was unable to penetrate with neither thermal, IRS- anything. With the situation seeming dire, SOKOM prepared a full maneuver and needed their best to be the tip of the spear… and so The Frømandskorpset was called upon.

This wasn’t a usual mission for us, there was no knowledge of enemy combatants we could rationalize and then distance ourselves from, this was the unknown… a village on our home soil was being held hostage by… something, we didn’t know what, but what we did know was that every single soul that lived there was waiting for us to swoop in and help. And by every soul that we have ever failed, every god that has ever lived, we were going to. The walk out to the tarmac seemed a lot more tense that it normally had, and for reasons unknown to me the insertion would occur at night time. Maybe our command believed our usual tactics of night infiltration would give us an advantage prior missions did not, whatever it was- they were wrong. Usually we would be climbing aboard a plane to be sent to a different continent, however instead we loaded up into a “Lynx”, a british dual twin engined helicopter used for close insert. This felt a lot more like a deployment than it did home turf.

The flight was short, 30 minutes but it felt like hours… I kept gripping my rifle, a MK18, a short barreled rifle imported from the United States. Plenty of the korps had started to use the new Sig MCXs, but my quadrailed workhorse had carried me through several tours… so like my team, I trusted it. No matter what we would face, we would encounter it together.

We arrived at a staging ground near the Urggerby river near Hjørring. The fog complicated things to the point where an LZ for a bird couldn’t be planned. Not just because of any possible OPFOR in the area of operation, but, well… the mist wouldn’t allow the pilots to see any trees or flora, which could turn a quick landing into a mass casualty scenario. So, we did things the frogman way, from the water. A “rigid hull inflatable boat”, or a “Zodiac”, they’re the inflatable boats seen in every action movie. They’re cumbersome, they get shaken and thrown by any small waves, and they’re all around just a damn pain to use. However, they’re somehow still the most reliable source of redundant amphibious transportation we had second to swimming. 

Our CO gave us our “ramp brief” right then and there on the dock, it was short and to the point: whatever mist exists seems to be screwing with the comms. Whether it’s moisture or something else, they’re going to have to formulate a conclusion as to what’s going on, and if they can, neutralize it. If not, we were to cut, fall back, and let the heavy guns roll in. We knew what that meant, and that we’d better hope we could find a much cleaner solution while we were on the ground. A pit in my stomach formed as we all stepped onto our rubber chariot and started off. 

With darkness fully set in, the naked eye couldn’t see anything, so we took to using our GPNVGs… “quad nods”, as some would say. A set of four tubes allowing for a wide view that naked the dark seem as clear as day, albeit with a white and blue hue. This allowed us to safely travel down the river, Anglerfish steering, Largemouth sat near the front incase we took any incoming fire, Codfish and I on either side. 

However… the ride got slower as we finally encountered the fog. It seemed almost as if one moment it was there, the next, all over us, you could barely see the edges of the river and the green near it so Angler had to crank way-the-hell down. It then became a slow crawl through the marsh, our Zodiac turning left and right through the weaving river as the IR lasers mounted to our weapons, scanned across the edges of the fog, ready incase anything were to test us. And then… we were only a few kilometers from the village when the engine suddenly… died. One second, the low hum of the propellers, the next, off. This caused Angler to gaze back in surprise, a low mutter of “What the hell?”. 

Largemouth kept watch as the rest of us moved to inspect the engine, Codfish opened it up and was astounded. “It’s in perfect condition…” he muttered, looking up at me; “Something’s preventing it from igniting, so it… just won’t start”. As he continued to dig deeper into the engine, triple checking to make sure his assessment wasn’t wrong, I sat there debating our options as the Zodiac drifted to a halt as the water remained deathly still, leaving us all in a permeable silence. That’s what I noticed first, the silence… 

We frogmen spend a lot of time in the field, figuratively and literally soaking in nature’s worst, yet most pure conditions. I’ve spent a lot of time up to my mouth in swamp water, mud… and taking in nature you realize something; there is always some sort of sound. A cricket, a bird, anything… heat had returned to Europe so the winter’s cold wasn’t in effect, living creatures had come out of hibernation, and there are some LZs I’ve been to where the cicadas are so loud we had to yell to each other in order to hear. And yet, here? Dead silence, all ambient sound muffled by whatever the hell this fog was made of, and the water was still. This was an active river, there should be some sort of current. And yet? Whatever was in these woods commanded its respect. The forest around us was much more afraid of it than it was a team of Danish Special Forces operatives. We had to tread carefully. 

I reached for something on my vest, a PTT(Push to talk) device that connected our headsets to a team frequency. Usually we were close enough to not need it, however it helped minimize the amount of noise it made. \[“We aren’t getting any further on water, we need to ditch the raft and head in on foot”\] I said, Codfish gave up on the engine and took up a watch position. From over the channel, Anglerfish asked \[“What about our exfil?"\]; \[“-We’ll have to take the long way out"\] I responded, slinging my rifle as I braced myself, and dropped feet first into the icy river, and dragged the raft to the shore. 

As we stepped foot on soil, we beached the craft and maneuvered forward in a wedge; Largemouth to my right, Anglerfish to my left as he always seemed to help pick the best route to maneuver on, Codfish further back to keep our comms out of direct fire. The mist gave us little to no line of sight, only being able to see around five meters ahead at the most and that was it. An ambush could be waiting around any stump, any log, the trees were so condense it meant we had to twist and turn with every single step. And above all… I felt watched, I don’t mean my team… something from beyond the veil, predatory, malicious, was burning a hole through my soul. Watching us, waiting. This wasn’t ideal, and we were only a couple of steps from FUBAR. 

Finally, through the milky gray wall I finally caught sight of what we had been waiting for… the rooftop corner of a one floor house and part of a wooden fence, poking through the fog like bones to be uncovered. The air was still, too still considering the port we had departed from was as windy as could be. I quickly motioned for my team to halt, everyone stopped on a dime with not a sound between us. From there, we took up positions; Largemouth took cover behind a large tree and sighted what seemed to be the road into town just to our 9 o’clock. 

Denmark’s roads are decent, but this far out, left a considerable amount of dirt, cracks, and wear to be seen. Anglerfish covered our 3 o’clock, and Codfish knelt down and heaved his radio pack off his back. The unit was green brick, only visible from the antenna that remained half extended through the top of his bag. Fishing out the hand mic, he prepared to update our unit on our progress… that was until muttered under his breath in pain, dropping the hand mic.

“Fuck… it shocked me-” he said, favoring his hand. That wasn’t good, these radios were lined with plastic and metal preventing any sort of harm to the user. Codfish tried again, keying into the hand mic however, shook his head. “I’m getting nothing…” he said, as he unzipped the bag and revealed the screen and button pad of the radio. To our surprise, it was dead, no frequency, no info. Nothing. “You made sure the battery was fresh, right?” I asked, to Codfish’s confusion as he pulled the metal brick from the bag, “of course, I don’t… what the-” Codfish’s words trailed off when he opened up the radio. The beige square battery, along with the entire inside of the radio was layered with moss. He had to fight to pry the battery out showing that it was caked in it, along with a ton of condensation. 

“You know how to maintain your equipment?” Largemouth said, gazing at the site as he went back to scanning the road. “Shut your mouth, of course I do!!” Codfish snapped back in a harsh whisper. It wasn’t uncommon for moisture in a fog this thick to leak through bags, fatigues, rucks… but these radios were, under reasonable circumstances, able to hold up against being rained on for a considerable amount of time. That, and when the batteries are locked in, the compartment is virtually sealed… and it was inside a waterproof bag. Codfish hadn’t dropped into the river as well. Something wasn’t right… the more we fussed over the radio, the more it seemed the darkness around us was closing in, smothering us. 

“You think your Harris can reach it?” I asked, referencing the smaller radio mounted to his vest. We all had them to communicate through our headsets if need be, and they could reach out quite a ways. However, a proper radio unit was needed for sustainable communication. He switched to the T.O.C’s channel and keyed in. 

[“-Any station on this net, I am requesting a Radio check….”] I heard his words buzz through my headset. 
Only silence answered, so I tried; 
[“ElementLead to Main, Radio Check, over… Any station…”]. 

Nothing, although no words were said, I could feel the unanimous feeling of dread wash over all of us. “Pick up, we’re heading in…” I said, rising to my feet. “What about our comms? We’ve got no way to alert main” Codfish asked, packing away his radio. “We still need to figure out what’s happened, no info, no point to us being here… and we’re sitting ducks…” I explained, I looked to Largemouth; “You got anything?”. He shook his head “Negative, road is empty” scanning with his MG3. At the very least, we still had the element of surprise- hopefully.   

“What about you?” I asked Anglerfish. 

No response from my designated marksman as he continued to stare out into the swamp, his rifle braced against the tree. I looked to Codfish, who gazed back, a mutual look of nervousness. I called out to Anglerfish again… and after a moment, he seemed to shake his head, coming out of disassociation. “No, nothing” he said, picking up and preparing to move. “You good?” I asked, locking eyes with his GPNVG’s tubes as he slowly turned, staring at me; “Yeah…” he said, in a low tone. The pit in my stomach grew deeper with every single step we took into that hell, however I didn’t have the luxury of stopping for long. None of us did. I had my team form into a Diamond… Codfish and Anglerfish to my right and left, Largemouth covering our rear. 

The roads were definitely experiencing the effects of the rainy season after several weeks of no maintenance, as a layer of mud and gravel caked the surface. The houses around us, dark, filled with shadows and pitch black voids were a mix of old style stone and hay, and newer brick houses with wood and tiles. However… all of them looked deserted. I probably would’ve been shivering from the wet cold of the air, had adrenaline not been pumping through every vein in my body. The low visibility of the fog and darkness left a thousand avenues of ambush and approach that needed to be covered, for a million possibilities. 

Our home was being overrun by whatever the parasitic mist had brought, and every single step we took drew us further and further into this mobile killbox. I could tell my men were feeling it… Codfish focused far too much on certain windows and shadows, causing him to quickly, yet messily snap to new points. From the corner of my vision, through the white-blue of my nods, I could see Largemouth’s head snapping back again, and again. Yet… Anglerfish seemed distant,  sniper’s needed to be calm, comfortable in uncomfortable situations… but he seemed too much to the point of complacent. 

A shape from my front caused me to halt my team. It was rectangular, four doors with a license plate that read; “AW 65 683” with a light bar on the top. Through the low light I could see it was white, with jagged markings… a police patrol vehicle. The front and rear left side doors were opened, the back window was smashed from a circular impact mark… blunt force trauma, a rock or a brick. No signs of life from where we were… We moved in, Anglerfish and Largemouth took the right side, IR lasers scanning through as Codfish and I cleared the open left. 

It was empty… I had my team set in as I ordered Codfish to inspect the radios, seeing if there was anything we could work with. After a few seconds, he called me over… he was leaning in on the passenger’s, I slid in the driver’s seat, flipping up my night vision. Codfish shined a red light, it was how we illuminated an area we needed to see without nods, without giving up our position light a white light would. It wasn’t that great, but as the red glow shined over the dashboard where a radio should be… only an empty radio mounted remained, covered in moss. In fact, the entire inside of the vehicle was dripping wet.

While I initially thought it was the fog, the similarities to our radio sent a chill up my spine. 

“What do you think?” Codsfished asked. What did I think? I knew that whatever cut off our ability to contact our support, did so to the local forces. It was attempting to dissect through severing information chains… I knew that something was watching us, as every pore on my back felt like it was on fire from something staring at me. This fog was a screening device, it ate at the town, deteriorating it, taking the people, leaving ghosts behind… However, my team was on edge already, and the last thing I needed to do was rile them up. “We need to keep moving…” I muttered, Codfish hesitated for a second before exiting the vehicle. We kept maneuvering down the road, nothing but shadows and silence greeted us as you could hear the sounds of our boots treading through the mud and rock.

Per our orders, we tried to locate any person, look for any signs of life.. To no avail. Doors remain unlocked and open, as we quietly breached and entered we found no one, just a layer of dust and water over everything. This continued for house, after house, as we tried our best to clear through, investigate… and came up with nothing. Still I waited, wondering where the first strike was going to come from. We were in no position to make it, not since we stepped off those docks. We were the best of the best, and I was leading us to our demise. 

We had reached a centerpoint of the village, a large stone church with a main tower that jutted up at least 20 meters high, piercing the fog. In fact, the mist seemed to get thinner the closer we got to it. My IR laser traced the stained glass windows and doors, the slits beside the doors, the stone stairs… “Might be a good point to rest at…” I said, turning back to Largemouth; “Cover the road, I’m going to-”. 

Our low toned discussion was cut off by a loud bang that shook the silence of the village. The crack, and thoom jolted us awake as instincts took over, a sound we were all too familiar with.   
  
A gunshot; it had arrived. 

“Contact!!!” Largemouth yelled, seeing the assailant before I had. He took aim at the church door with MG3 and let loose; the german belt fed machine gun is referred to as the “buzzsaw” for good reason, in another time, another life, it had acted as a human wave reducer. Now? Our best chance at survival as it tore through the wood with a thunderous burst. The rest of us quickly rushed to the church’s stone wall, taking cover as Largemouth placed his gun on the top face of it. We were in no position to burn ammo, with no comms it meant no chance for resupply so I called “Watch and shoot!!”.   

Codfish covered us from behind as Angler took aim at the church with Largemouth, I kept my back to the wall and looked over at my gunner; “What did you see?”. 

“Handgun from between the doors, cracked off a shot-” Largemouth said, sights glued to the front of the church. “Aimed at us?” I asked to confirm, however he retorted: “It was aimed out when it fired, likely just a bad shot, lucky for us”. Codfish immediately snapped at Largemouth: “You did not even confirm if it was firing at us?! It could be a scared civilian!!”. 

“We saw the patrol vehicle, the police were compromised” Largemouth argued. “Both of you shut it” I barked, silencing their feud. “We need to move, our position is no longer a secret…” Anglerfish muttered, gazing at the fog, my eyes followed his, as I muttered “It never was”.

“Wait!! Wait!! Please!!!” A voice from the church called out, Anglerfish and I quickly had our sights trained on the door with Largemouth as Codfish kept watch elsewhere. From the doors, the handgun… a revolver, was tossed out to the steps, as a police officer carefully stepped out, arms raised.

Largemouth looked to me as I peeked over the wall; “We’re Royal Army, identify yourself!!”. The man’s head dipped back in relief: “...Thank god… I am officer Lyster-” he said, confirming his affiliation, I stood up, a leap of faith that was returned when the officer dropped his hands, he then looked around, anxious of the situation as he gestured us inside. “Quickly… that exchange will not go unnoticed…” although Largemouth showed obvious signs of hesitation, I took the lead stating “Pick up your weapon, you’re gonna need it”. Lyster then grabbed his revolver and ushered us in. Inside the church, we had finally found it: signs of life, what was left anyways. 

Village inhabitants had taken cover behind pews and tables, dimly lit candles illuminating the central area as the windows had been covered with curtains and blankets. The silent of the church broke out into relieved sighs and mutters as we entered. Mothers hugged daughters and sons, grandmothers… but little to no males, aside from Lyster and a couple of other officers. I took his chance to flip up my nods, Lyster quickly shoved what was left of the door closed as another officer barred it. Largemouth pulled off his helmet as I could see steam from his hot sweat entering the cool air. “Why’d you open fire?” I asked Lyster, who rubbed his temples, embarrassed. “I… thought you were… one of them” Lyster said cryptically, deepening the pit in my stomach as I asked; “Them?”. 

Lyster then gestured to behind us, the church’s priest greeted us, bowing his head. “We are so glad to see you… we… are running desperately low” the old man said, tears welling up in his eyes. “It’s alright…” Largemouth said, setting the MG3 down on it’s biped as he knelt, from what I can only guess was him attempting to alleviate the back pain that every machine gunner felt. I ordered Anglerfish to take up a good overwatch position, to which he immediately climbed a small set of scaffolds used to help replace and maintain the church’s windows, stopping at a circular one above the doors. “I heard you say, you were… Army?” the priest said, I nodded; “Our radios are down so for now, it’s just us. We’ve been sent in as the forward element to figure out what happened here..”. 

“It’s a swamp witch…” officer Lyster muttered, “repeat that, a what?” Codfish asked.   

“Not just any…” the priest said, he paused for a moment, locking eyes with all three of us, before he took a shaky inhale… and explained; “Over the past several years, the children who lived here said they saw the currents in the nearby bayou break. However, something changed… when the rainy season arrived, the mists that would come and go, didn’t leave… and as our home became more and more shrouded, people began to disappear. First the men… then, the police when they tried to investigate… before long, people started to take refuge…”.

I looked to Lyster, dread filling his eyes as he looked to the floor, then back to me “I… tried to lead a search party out there…” he said, breaking off as he fought to steady his voice. “...We couldn’t even see what was taking our guys out there before it was just me and a handful of others…” he said. I looked back to the priest, despair of the past several weeks was clashing with the relief of us being here, even if it was just the four of us… it was hope to them. “So… what the hell is it?”.

“Nixie…” the priest stated, forcing his mouth to utter the word like it was a damned hex. “-or Nøkk, as the legend refers to her as. Some tales describe her as malicious, a being that lurks the swamps, hoping to kidnap. Others describe her as curious… this seems to be the former”. This was a lot to take in; some sort of legend from the folklore that was as entrenched in our home as the soil and dirt was. I wanted to believe it was hysteria, the priest and officer attempting to rationalize it. But… that didn’t explain the fog, the moss, the feeling of being watched, the disappearances, ‘Them’.... Wait.

“What did you mean by ‘them’-” I quickly asked Lyster, just as he was about to speak, Anglerfish called down: “We’ve got movement!! Front of the church, woodline, from our Ten to our Three he started, checking the chamber of his rifle. Lyster’s eyes quickly locked with mine; “You’re about to find out…”. 

Once again, my instinct as a leader took over… I ordered the priest to get everyone to the safest position they could, which as he then called out: “-To the cellar, hurry!!!”. An anxious, yet surprisingly orderly stampede filled the church as the dozens inside the church hurried underground. I grabbed Lyster by the arm and told him and his officer to get down there and keep the people safe, but not before saying “blow out every light you’ve got here, we need it dark”. Lyster nodded, snapping into action as he and his men put out every single candle they could. I flipped down my GPNVGs, what was once an warm, orange room became a dark, blue and white battlefield. Largemouth was already set up, poking his MG3 through a gap in the broken wooden door as Codfish took aim through one of the slits beside it. With no entrances on any other side of the church, we prepared to defend the front.

I peeked through the other slit beside the door, rifle first, my suppressor leading as all our eyes were glued to the woodline across the street that our IR lasers scanned intensely like a lightshow… and what I saw sent a shiver down my spine. People, the disappeared, those taken… all walked through the marsh and tall grass across from the church. Butcherers, tailors, all those in between, and many of the lost officers all walked to the edge of the road and stopped. Their movements were unnatural, and the way they just stood there, opposing us… daring us. And their eyes, they glowed, human eyes didn't glow.

A leader amongst them emerged… the police chief. Even from across the street, I could see the blank face he had as he stared wide eyed at us. Silence filled the church, then broken up by the muffled cries of the civilians downstairs. Mothers trying desperately to calm their children down…The thing that was the police chief then spoke. His voice was monotone, like a puppet being controlled, yet his words came out smoothly… too smoothly: “Come on out… we need not fight”.

A minute of silence passed; I gazed over to Codfish who gazed back, Largemouth was locked in place, taking aim. There was no playbook on this, how in the hell were you supposed to negotiate with a… a thing, a paranormal anomaly? I barked back with whatever I could think; “What did Nixie offer you?!”. “More happiness that we’d ever known…” his answer was immediate, and the artificial attempt at “emotion” behind his words shook something deep down inside of me. His voice echoed across the chapel as he continued; “You can feel it too, as can all of them… just come outside”.

“What’s the play?” Anglerfish asked.

“We should just lay into them” Largemouth suggested, Codfish scoffed “Enough of your bullheadedness” he muttered. I looked out and gazed at the chief, who… even now, I felt was looking directly at me: “You’re gonna betray everyone you swore to protect? The women? The children?” I asked. Then… a smile crossed his face as he said: “Oh…. don’t worry…. Once the children went underneath, they’ve never felt pain again”.

My throat ran dry.

The last thing I heard was Largemouth angrily cursing beneath his breath as he let loose; The retrofitted suppressor he had mounted onto the front of his gun barely contained the thunderous sound of a long burst of rounds tore through the night as the yellow and reds of rounds. The brick of the church shook, the door swayed slightly, and I saw the tracers and rounds tear the police chief in half where he stood. Then… the horde mounted at the edge of the marsh rushed the chapel. Their eyes were filled with an animalistic rage; they crushed grass, branches, vaulted the stone fence, and yet… were completely silent, and smiling.

“Engage!! Engage!!!” I screamed, the sound barrier of the mist battling Largemouth’s controlled bursts of violence as groups of them were cut down at a time, a pile of brass building up around him. Even then, some still tried to crawl as pieces of themselves hung off by tendon and flesh. Their commandeered bodies now had only one goal: breach the church, and commit unspeakable horrors to those inside- we would not allow that.

Those that reached the windows were taken down by Codfish and I, who with controlled groups of two and three rounds, kept the swarm at bay. I still remember it. A series of hands reaching inside, fingers trying to grasp on anything. Three shots tear through the palms, hit one in the head and drops them instantly. Another salvo, another down. They were once my countrymen, now my enemy, prior allegiances didn’t matter now- or at least that’s what I kept telling myself. I remember hitting the release and letting the metal mag drop to the floor, as I shoved a new one in and hit the bolt release replenishing my weapon.

“Make your shots count!!” I yelled, last thing we needed was all of our ammo burned through. Just then the worst call out I could ever imagine reached my ears. “Soldier!!!” a woman yelled from beneath the cellar. There was no way they could have entered, we had every entrance covered-... that we knew of.

I yelled at my team to stand their ground as I rushed to the cellar, quickly rounding a small bannister and heading down the steps… I saw the dark cellar was bathed in the blue ambient light of the outside. Dozens of people were huddled against the walls, hysterical screams and the tearing of flesh could be heard as I came face to face with them.

One was a man, the other a police officer, both were coming through a storm door, and locked eyes with me. Their eyes… even now it haunts me. No pupils, no color, just milky white. When they saw me, they took off after me… Six shots, two to the body one to the heads of both, at just a couple of meters… the sound of my suppressed barrel bounced off the walls in the room, undoubtedly deafening anyone close.. Many grabbed their ears, screaming as the two assailants hit the ground. I fired an additional round into the bodies, not wanting a demonic round 2.

“Lyster!!” I screamed, looking around… it seemed as if the entire wall moved. A hulking thrall turned, eyes glowing milky white as it turned and growled. I raised my barrel to fire, only for the goliath to swipe it aside, grabbing me by the front of my plate carrier and throwing me into a stone column. My back hit the wall, my helmet hit the column, shaking my brain as my instinct forced me to rise off the floor, sore as hell. I had to keep going… I messily raised my Mk18, firing off several rounds into its legs that only seemed to slow it. Then… it grabbed me around the neck. I could feel my life fading as it squeezed, a vice grip causing me to gasp and sputter, a wretched smile gracing its face. My other hand, unable to reach for anything, fought to keep it’s other mitt from my neck.

Then… a yell came from behind as the priest appeared from the dark and raised an ax in the air and came down onto it’s back. The creature yelled, from his left, one of the village women shoved a candle stand into it’s faced, stunning it. With his hold on my throat loosened, oxygen returned… my hand quickly went to my holster, drawing my glock from its kydex prison as I shoved it well into its mouth- firing off shot after shot. Thankfully whoever made that perfect Austrian handgun decided not to pull a safety that mattered. The rounds echoed off, unsuppressed muzzle blast stripping away skin from the entry as rounds painted the ceiling with it’s vile insides. As it fell down, my body moved like clockwork; holstered my pistol, raised my rifle, switched to auto- riddled it’s body, burst after burst. My gun went dry, dropped a magazine, insert another- hit the release. Click. The priest quickly moved to secure the storm door. I looked around, locating Lyster… God.

He was slumped against the wall the behemoth had been at. As I knelt down beside the fallen officer, he coughed up blood, trying to roll over but my hand snapped to his shoulder keeping him pinned. The brute had done a number to him, tearing open his stomach… it was a mess of organ flesh and blood. Even with my nods on, I could barely fight to keep my face from being sickened, and mournful. He looked at me with weak eyes. “Is it bad?” he asked, my silence was his answer.

“Damn… I…-I guess this is my penance for my failure” Lyster said, blood beginning to pour out the side of his mouth as he turned to me. I shook my head; “None of that… save your breath, officer”. The last thing he needed to do was dump all of his oxygen blaming himself, nothing he could have done could have prevented this, any of thing.

“You need to kill, Nixie… she won’t stop here…” he requested, no, demanded with his dying breath. How were we supposed to kill her, could we even? The word Nøkk was as engrained in Scandinavian mythology as folklore that I knew growing up. Could we even do anything? I looked away, then back to Lyster… he was pleading with his eyes for us to stop it, begging me.  He raised his hand, I grabbed it, squeezing it as I nodded to him.

“Take it easy, we’ve got it from here”. His lips formed to say something, then… stopped. I watched and felt the life leave him. As his hand dropped to the floor, I shut his eyes. The best sign of respect I could show to a man who died defending his home. I stood up, gazing at everyone, including the priest who looked at the blood on his hands, then mournfully to me. I then noticed the gun fire had stopped. “I’ll be topside…” I said to him, he nodded, walking slowly over to Lyster as I left the cellar silently.

Back up top my team had done their job, and done it well. Bodies lined the stairs and lawn. And yet through the silence, Codfish and Largemouth continued to bicker; “We could have-” Codfish said, being cut off by Largemouth who stepped forward “Done what? Let them drag us into the swamp? I gave us the early advantage, you should be thanking me-”. I stepped over each of the bodies; every single face had a story that ended, a life cut short, a family that was robbed or they were robbed from. I didn’t count the dead, couldn’t bring myself too.

“Enough” I ordered, all three turning. Codfish stepped forward “Are they alright?”, I nodded “Mostly…”. Codfish and Largemouth shared a look, then back to me;“Lyster?” Largemouth asked, slowly shaking my head in response.

“Damn…” my gunner said, dipping his head, he looked back to me “Well what now?”. “We need to reconnect with command and bring in a battalion, maybe more, this is out of our depth” Codfish argued. Largemouth laughed and shook his head “Run? Now?! And leave everyone in there to be slaughtered?!”.

“How many more has this mist taken? How much ammo do you have left? We are a recon element, we have to fall back” Codfish barked back.

“They knew we were here since we stepped foot on the shore, if we leave it’ll be on foot and we will be ambushed. We know the direction they came from, and right now we are the only ones that can stop it. They won’t stop here… she won't-”.

My team was bathed in silent, Codfish and Largemouth gazing around as Anglerfish stared, deadlocked onto my face. “We are the best of the best, there is no one else… We stop her… we have to try”. Codfish gave a shaky, unsure exhale as he nodded; “Alright. Where to?”.

“Northeast…” Anglerfish said, quiet, scanning the direction they came from; “I wasn’t sure if it was wind or something else but they came from that direction…” his words were like molasses, slow, an uneven cadence.

“How’re we supposed to kill her anyways? She’s some sort of witch” Largemouth asked. “Beings like here are drawn to our side by being tied to an object…” a voice caught our attention, the priest. He stepped over the bodies, his eyes unable to gaze at a single one. “Before she could only manifest through the mist or the water, faint glances, nothing more. If she’s here… it means someone brought here here, aided her in passing through…”.

Aided. Allies.
Ones that weren’t taken by the mist.

“So… someone on… ‘our side’...” I said, a half question, to which the priest nodded at. I continued “-helped this fucking thing. Allowed all of this…”. Once again, he nodded “very likely”. “Why?” Codfish asked the million krone question. “I… don’t know. Power? Maybe she gave them something. Either way, she is tied to something, an object, a rune, a site. Destroy it, and her ties to this side will be severed”. 

I looked at my team, Codfish and Largemouth nodding. The priest departed, wishing us well; “God be with you, son. I must… see to our fallen”.  

We didn’t know what was coming next, but I don’t think anything could have prepared any of us for it.
