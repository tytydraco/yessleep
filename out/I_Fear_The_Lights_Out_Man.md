I wasn't scared of the dark.



I took a lot of pride in that. I’d boast about it in school. Particularly to boys, who said they weren’t either, but I could tell they were lying. I knew I was bigger and braver than they were. Every night, my parents would read me a story, tuck me in, and turn off the lights. I never complained about the darkness. Never once did I ask for a nightlight. I never would in a million years. I knew there was nothing there, and I felt strong about it. And every night, I would slept soundly in my bed. My parents were so very proud of their little girl. 



But one day, at school, I was boasting about how unafraid I was to a group of boys from the upper year, I thought they were probably as scared as the boys from my class. The boys in my year went sheepish when they had to pretended they weren’t scared at night. These upper year boys just looked confused. One leant down to my height and asked,



“Aren’t you scared of The Lights Out Man?”



I didn’t understand this so I just laughed at whatever the boys were making up.



“Course I’m not scared of a Lights Off Man. I’m not scared of anything! Or the dark!” I really stressed that last part as I reminded them. It made the lead boy chuckle.



“You mean you’re not scared of the Lights Out Man. Who creeps in little girls' wardrobes. And knows if they’ve been bad. Boastful. Rude.”



“Course I’m not scared!”



“You Probably haven't even seen him. The shape that waits at the end of your bed to wrap you up and take you away.”



“Have too!”



The boy circled, walking slowly around me.



“No. If you had, you'd be afraid of the dark.”



What the boy had said made me so unbelievably cross. I was annoyed the rest of the day, all the way home, and all the day after that. Until my parents tucked me into bed, turned off the lights, and closed the door. 

I didn’t go to sleep in the darkness. I couldn’t see it in the near pitch black, but I knew my wardrobe was on the other side of the room. That silly boy's words played on my mind. After a long while of tossing and turning, I got out of bed, and felt my way over to the wardrobe. I opened it and stuck my hands in, waving them around quickly in the empty space. I sighed, annoyed that I let his words get to me. No one was around, but I felt that the upper year boy had made me look silly. I shuffled back over to my bed and got back in. When I settled, a car drove past my window, and through the cracked edges of the curtains, illuminated my room just a little. 



I froze under the blanket. In the corner of the room stooped a black shapeless mass. Tall but crouched. Formless. It was lit for just a second, but in that second I decided what it was. I thought its name over and over, The Lights Out Man, all through the night, until my parents opened the door in the morning. And in the light of morning there was nothing there. 



*A bad dream*, they told me when I confessed what I'd seen. *Nothing to worry about*. So I went to school; I didn’t say much all day. I saw the upper year boys again from a distance and made sure to avoid them. But all through the day I thought about the shape. The Lights Out Man. Until once again it was bedtime. My parents tucked me in, turned out the lights and closed the door. I waited, all through the night, to see if it was still there. And late, later than I could know, a car drove past in the dead of night, and my room was lit again. There was no mass of shadow in the corner, no thing hiding in the corner of the room. The car seemed to wait outside for a moment. And in the few extra seconds before it pulled away, a form rose at the foot of my bed. The same unsure shape, but the mass was taller now. Thinner or compact. And it crouched no more. It loomed over the bed until the car was gone and the room went black. 



I knew it was there all night, hovering over the bed. But when morning came, and my parents opened the door, there was nothing in my room. Another day passed and all I thought about was The Lights Out Man in my room. 



Once more it came to my bedtime. I was scared when my parents tucked me in. They read me a story and kissed me on the head. All the time I stared at the end of my bed. When it came time to go, they stood at the door, and I turned to look at them. They switched off the lights. 



My parents stood in the light of the landing, in the frame of the door. In front of the frame, right next to my bed, next to my head, a black figure grew. A disproportionate mass of what looked like arms, and other shapes. I thought that they must be able to see it, it was right between us, but slowly, they closed the door and whispered goodnight. As the last slit of light stopped illuminating my room, as the door started to closed, I saw the shape expand and grow. They shut the door, and I heard a sort of bubbling, and a hissing. It moved over me and grew more. And in a moment, as I felt its darkness wrap around me, I couldn't be scared of the dark again.
