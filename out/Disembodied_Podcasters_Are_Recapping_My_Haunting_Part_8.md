[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oi09nz/disembodied_podcasters_are_recapping_my_haunting/)

I think I found the last internet café in existence. It’s sandwiched between some voodoo store, a family restaurant, and an adult film store in a crappy part of town. Open twenty-four hours. Some dude’s sitting in the corner muttering about bees and a hole, the clerk’s having a debate with some guy about LSD, the devil, and some guy with the last name of King, and I’m in the back of the room in the brightest corner possible, hoping this blue light ruins my chances of sleeping.

What I just watched was pretty graphic. Hopefully the sensation of wanting to throw up helps me stay awake.

The final episode of ScareTare starts off like a normal podcast. There’s a spooky little music intro before SCARETARE shows up in big blue letters. It cut to the faces of my secondary tormentors.

“Welcome to ScareTare, boys and girls!” yelled Harris. The splitscreen video showed him to be a hairy guy in his thirties, dark curly hair and a medium length beard. He wore black and sat in front of a room with red LEDs lighting the background.

“What’s up, guys? Welcome back, hope you’re doing well.” Isaac was a taller guy with black hair, big lips, and a stupid mustache. They looked like guys who would have a podcast retelling scary stories.

Harris continued. “This week, by popular request, we are reading *Listen to the Poltergeist* by the author only known as Haversham. He’s the same author of *The Tower in the Trees*, which we read last week…”

“Which was our highest watched episode ever!” said Isaac. “Thank you guys so much!”

“Yeah thank you guys. So glad to finally get a version of that story out there. We knew the popularity of our podcast meant it wouldn’t get taken down, especially since, seriously, everyone can just read it for free online anyway.” Harris ended that sounding dismissive.

“Yeah fingers crossed the author doesn’t come after us.” Isaac said. They both laughed. “But it’s still up and doing great numbers.”

“Well I’m excited. *The Tower* was our best episode ever, so I’m excited for this one too,” Harris said, air of anticipation in his voice.

“Yeah, let’s do it,” said Isaac.

At that, Harris’ feed glitched out and went to static. Isaac sat up. “Did we lose Harris?”

His feed re-emerged. The background behind him had gone dark.

“Harris is there someone behind you?” said Isaac quizzically.

“Isaac, we’re not doing the ad read yet.”

“No seriously it looks like there’s someone behind you.”

“What? No, I’m home alone. There’s nobody here.”

“Are you pulling my leg?”

“No, dude. I’m not pulling your leg.”

“Ha! Must just be seeing things.”

At that moment a dark figure took a step out of the shadows behind Harris and slit his throat. Blood spilled out the front of Harris’ neck and sprayed over the display around him. A dark hand grabbed the top of his head as the camera went to black.

“Harris? Dude, what?” Isaac sounded worried. “Dude you better be playing a prank. Dude? Harris? You there? You ok?”

The camera fuzzed back to show Harris’ head. Isaac didn’t see it at first. “Oh dude, you had me worried there- Oh my god!”

Isaac realized that Harris’ head had been impaled on a spike after being cut off his neck. His mouth was agape, blood running down his face. Isaac started screaming.

“Oh my god! What the hell! Call the police! Somebody help!”

Then Isaac’s camera switched off and on. The area around him was now in shadow. Isaac was curled up into a ball, crying, whimpering to not die. The same dark figure took a step toward him as he trembled. Then, it grabbed Isaac by the lips and sliced them off with a long knife. Blood sprayed from Isaac’s mangled face, before the figure grabbed Isaac by the hair, held his head up, and said in a gravelly voice, “I told you not to plagiarize my work.”

With that, he plunged the knife through Isaac’s forehead, then beheaded him. The camera went to black and retuned with Isaac’s face mirroring Harris’ impaled on a spike.

The camera stayed on for another few hours, but nothing changed. I feel like those faces are burned into my vision now. Isaac and Harris haven’t spoken up since I watched the video.

I just looked up the story they were planning to read. I don’t even know what to say about this synopsis.

*A man moves into a decrepit house that he soon finds to be haunted by a poltergeist. For five nights, it leaves him strange messages on his wall. After the fifth message, he discovers they are warnings when he finds himself tormented by a sleep paralysis demon. The demon torments him for three nights before brutally consuming his insides and turning him into a flesh puppet, a spectator in his own body.*

*Authored by the anonymous Haversham, the author claimed it as his masterpiece before he disappeared in recent months.*

What. The. Hell.

The lights all just went out except for my computer screen. Nobody’s in the room anymore. Wait. No. There’s someone in the room.
