The worst day of my life started like any other day. Some days when I open my eyes, I think I am back there, in that car wash which was so much bigger inside than it looked outside. After a moment or two, I remember I am not, I flicker back to the present and lay bemused as to how I managed to escape.

But I did, and here I am. Now I am ready to write my story, to tell the world about the terrible happenings in that car wash .   

I thought it was a routine job- an OHS inspection of an automatic car wash and spare-parts store just outside a dingy old strip mall on the edge of my jurisdiction. There hadn’t been a call or anything- I had just been working my way through the files our admin had dumped on my desk on Monday, and this one came up.  

I idly flicked through the papers after I pulled up. It seemed straightforward enough- I should be in and out in ten minutes. It had changed ownership about eight months ago, to a Ms. Sandra-Kay Whitson. Raising my eyes at the theatrical name, neatly typed under the photo of a theatrical lady, I got out of my car, wondering why a woman who looked like that would choose a car-wash with an inheritance Auntie Mabel or whoever had left for her. A beauty parlour would have been more appropriate for this lady with her mane of stiffly-styled bottle-blonde hair.  

Sandra-Kay's appearance in person did not disappoint. Dressed in a tight low-cut black t-shirt, with all sorts of gleaming glittering chains festooning what I believe novelists call “her ample bosom”, she greeted me warmly, with that theatrical Scarlett O’Hara accent so common in the ladies of our fair city- an accent that sounds genuine in their early years, then is polished off, and then affected again as they approach a certain age. For I could see she was not as young she first appeared, chains and boobs notwithstanding. There were wary lines around her bright blue eyes, and under the Scarlett blur, I heard a tinge in her voice I usually hear in restaurants owners known for employing illegals.  

But a car-wash doesn’t employ many staff. I looked around and smiled briskly at her. She smiled back at me. “I’m so happy with this place!” she drawled. “Such a good investment! And keeps me out of trouble!” She giggled. “So where do you want to start, Ms Inspector? Is that right, how to call you? I hope I’m not going to get in trouble! This is my first time.” She batted her eyelashes at me “Please be gentle ma’am.”  

I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. “Nothing to be worried about Ms. Whitson. Let’s start by double-checking the information you’ve submitted on form 4A- right, no full-time hires-”  

She rattled off the information competently, confirming my instinct that she was no fool. Then I started the site inspection. The shop – with piles of ill-kept and poorly-displayed ware was empty, with one lone customer driving through the car wash. Thankfully the state of the shop was not my business, and everything seemed in order OSHA-wise. I was heading to leave, already thinking about grabbing an ice coffee before checking in at the next site on my list, when I heard it.  

A low moan. I paused. Then I looked back. Sandra-Kay was at the desk, chatting to a bald customer- looked like she was persuading him to buy something. Then I looked back again at the empty dark interior.  

I couldn’t tell where the sound had come from. Sandra-Kay's voice seemed very distant, and I could hear cars outside. I stepped further in.  

“Everything ok in there?” called Sandra-Kay from the front. 

“I thought- I heard something” I muttered, almost to myself. There was no-one in the shop but me, it was tiny. I looked at the piles of unidentifiable car parts lying around, on shelves, on the floor, looking dusty, as if no-one had touched them for ages. How could this be a viable shop? Of course it was a front. I sighed. There were steps we had to take if we suspected this sort of thing, and I just felt suddenly drained.  

“Can I help you?” Sandra-Kay suddenly appeared next to me, her glossy large lips gleaming in the dark of the shop.  

A stifled moan, a groan. I froze. There was no doubt about it. Somewhere in this shop, or under this shop, or behind the walls of this shop, a human was in agony. I turned to her. 

At the same time, a burst of pain exploded in my head. I felt myself falling, I felt the cool concrete of the floor. And then darkness.  

I could hear voices, in the distance, but coming nearer. Mom? Irate and talking fast, like Mom. “A government officer! You hit a government officer! Harvey, what got into you!” No- it wasn’t Mom.  

“Shut up Sandra!” a man's rough voice. “I said I’ll deal with it.” It was the customer from the shop. I kept my eyes closed. The man continued. “Go back up to the shop- I can’t stop the work now. Give me an hour or so, this batch needs to stabilize. I can’t start from scratch. Didn’t you know there was OSHA today?!” 

“This is not my fault Harvey!” Sandra-Kay's voice was high with anger and fear, with no trace of Scarlett. I heard her heels clacking on the floor. And then the man called Harvey seemed to move away too. There was silence.  

But not for long. As I opened my eyes and tried to stagger up, I heard it again. In fact I realised I had been hearing it through my unconsciousness. The moans and groans, much louder now.  

 I had been dumped on a floor. I rubbed my hand on the back of my neck, and then looked at the congealing blood smeared over it. But it didn’t seem to hurt anymore.  

Bright lights were screwing in my eyes. I blinked, and staggered to my feet.  

 I looked around. I was in a small windowless room, hardly bigger than the bed it contained. A boy of perhaps thirteen lay curled in the bed cradling his distended belly, moaning. It was clear he was very ill.

I rushed to the door. "Help" I cried. "Help!" I rattled the handle.

"It's- no- use." gasped the boy. "They keep us locked." His eyelashes fluttered, and he opened his eyes. "You're an adult. Are you a nurse? Are you helping Harvey?"

Helplessly, I shook my head.
