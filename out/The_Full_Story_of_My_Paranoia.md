This is a bit of a long story but that’s the thing about going crazy - it doesn’t happen all at once. It’s a slow boil until the pot rattles itself off the stove. I’m putting every detail here because the details are what made people roll their eyes. The details are what made me doubt myself. And the details are what eventually pushed me to start acting like a stalker, just to prove I had one.

I live alone in a one-bedroom on the sixth floor of a narrow, brick-and-glass building that pretends it’s “boutique” by way of a chalkboard in the lobby that says WELCOME HOME in cursive. My view is the back alley: a sliver of sky, a row of dumpsters, and the backs of cafes where staff stand in the doorways blowing steam off their hands in winter. In summer there’s the smell of hot metal and overripe fruit from the produce store. The alley hums differently every season. I know that now: what the humming should sound like when no one else is there.

I keep odd hours because I do copyediting and manuscript formatting for a small press that thinks deadlines mean “last minute or not at all,” so I send a lot of emails at 2 a.m. and nap in chopped-up blocks. Nights aren’t scary when you live at your own pace. Nights make sense. Nights are consistent.

In June, nights stopped being consistent.

It was small at first: my front door latch. If I let the door swing shut, it doesn’t click unless I turn the knob and push it into the frame. For the first two years, I learned the muscle memory. Then, suddenly, I’d come home from the elevator and the door would be even with the jamb, silent. 

You think you forgot. You make a note. I started a list in the Notes app called “Am I losing it?”. It was half a joke. I wrote:

1. 06/12: door shut quiet??
2. 06/13: coffee mug moved? (I leave it slightly skewed on the drying mat; it was parallel to the edge.)
3. 06/15: faint cigarette smell in hallway at 11 p.m. (No one on my floor smokes; I know because the property manager wasted an entire tenants’ meeting threatening to fine people.)
4. 06/17: coin on the bookshelf slid? (I keep a toonie on the corner of a shelf like a paperweight; it helps me remember where I set down the envelope with rent receipts. Don’t ask me why the coin matters. It mattered to me.)

I told myself I was making content out of nothing. I told myself my brain likes patterns, and anxiety will feed it. Kara (best friend) told me the same thing over wine: “You work alone. Your sense of time is fuzzy. It’s an off week. Leave your apartment messy on purpose. See if anything actually changes.”

So I started leaving “tells.” A hair taped across my bathroom drawer. A thread balanced on my bookshelf coin. A Q-tip wedged between my sliding balcony door and the rail. Not paranoid. Just curious. Like a kid setting flour on the floor and waiting for Santa’s boot prints.

On 06/21, the hair across the drawer was cut cleanly in the middle, both ends still trapped under the tape. A pair of cuticle scissors were laying by my soap dispenser.

I stared at it for a long time. The scissors were mine. I hadn’t used them. I called Kara. She said I’d probably snagged it myself and didn’t remember. She said, “Hey, we used to tape hair across our dorm mini-fridge, and it always fell off because of humidity.” She said, “You’re scaring yourself.”

I bought a doorbell camera. My camera lasted one night before a stern-looking security guard knocked and asked me to remove it. Dark hair, dark eyes, early thirties, knuckles like he’d worked with his hands before sitting in a lobby. He introduced himself as Aiden and said the rule wasn’t his; he just had to enforce it. “If you want to point something inside, go for it,” he added, lowering his voice like he was doing me a favor. “Just not into the hall.”

The management company sent a mass email within 24 hours of that night reminding tenants that cameras were not allowed on the hallway side of unit doors. For privacy reasons, they claimed.

So I did what Aiden said and set the camera inside, angled at the door. That was the night the camera battery died at 3:12 a.m., despite showing 86% at midnight. I woke to the colorless smear of dawn and a low battery chime. No footage. The door was shut quietly.

I started sleeping with the TV on. Not because I thought the sound would deter anyone but because the static blue wash on the wall would wake me if a shadow moved. The truth is I started sleeping like prey: shallow, with a rope of dread twisted under my ribs. You can’t live that way and be a person during the day. During the day you forget your own passwords and leave a burner on. During the day you pour milk into the sink and realize you were aiming for your coffee.

On 06/26, I found a folded paper napkin under my doormat when I came in from a run. It was the cheap brown kind from the café downstairs. Inside someone had printed, in narrow, careful block letters:

YOU FORGOT THE GREEN ONIONS AGAIN

It was true. I'd spent the last few days reminding myself that I needed to stop at the grocery store and pick some up. My brain told me to not make this about me. It’s a joke. Someone teasing their roommate. Not for me. But it also reminded me that it was my doormat the note had been left under.

I took a picture and added it to my list before taking a shower. I made a quick run after lunch to pick up some groceries and tried to put it again out of my mind.

The next morning there was a note inside my apartment. A yellow sticky note on my kitchen counter I swear I hadn’t put there. Same handwriting. Block letters that tried to look friendly by putting hearts in the middle of the O’s, which did the opposite.

ONION GREEN IS NOT GREEN ONION

I called the non-emergency line. The operator’s voice was soft with fatigue. “Has there been a break-in?”

I told her the latch thing. The hair. The napkin. The sticky note.

“Ma’am, we can send a patrol to check the building, but unless there’s damage or an intruder, there’s not much we can do. Have you notified your property manager?”

“Yes.”

“And?”

“And he said, ‘Make sure you’re locking the door.’”

A patrol came, took one look around, and told me to get a better lock. The locks are drilled into a steel frame set by the building. The super isn’t authorized to change the hardware. The company has a master key. “It’s a security issue if every tenant has their own,” the super explained, eyes sliding off mine. His name is Gerard but everyone calls him Gerry. He’s the kind of man who calls women “kiddo” past fifty and thinks it’s charming but he seemed harmless to me.

The sticky notes multiplied. They were never threatening, not in a way that would trigger anyone else’s alarm but mine. They were corrections. They were comments. They were edits.

YOUR SPLATS OF OLIVE OIL ON THE STOVE ARE GREASY; RUN THE HEAT A LITTLE LOWER.

A FEW MORE MINUTES AND YOUR COFFEE WON’T BE SOUR.

YOUR SHOES WILL LAST LONGER IF YOU DON’T KICK THEM OFF BY THE HEEL.

And once: YOU LOOK GOOD IN RED. GO BACK FOR THE SWEATER. 

I had tried on a sweater at a consignment shop on Dundas and put it back because I’m not actually a red person.

I started scanning faces everywhere: in line at the café, on the streetcar, in the reflection of the subway window. The security guard from the camera day, Aiden, smiled when I came in and asked if everything was okay. He had the practiced gentleness of people who get yelled at professionally. 

I said I thought someone might have a copy of my key. “You’d be surprised how often that happens,” he said. “Contractors, old supers, roommates… You can get your own deadbolt installed high up. They usually allow that.” He glanced up, measuring my height. “You might need a stool to reach it though.”

I’m five-two on a good day. I laughed, too quickly. “I’m not paranoid,” I told him. “It’s probably nothing.”

“Probably,” he said. “But paranoia is just a safety feature. Like a seatbelt. It’s dumb right up until it’s not.”

Every story has a moment where you could pull the fuse out before the fire gets to it. Here’s mine: I started following people.

Not like a pro. Not like the movies. I’d see a man whose hair was the same almost-black as Aiden’s but with a different jawline and I’d keep going after my coffee and then, without making a choice, I’d turn when he turned. If his bag had a frayed strap, I’d fixate on it and decide the fray was a clue. If he held the door for a woman and looked after her a beat too long, I’d decide that beat was intent. If he got off at my stop and stayed for three blocks in front of me, I’d slow down so he could pass me, then I’d fall in. I took pictures of shoes, backpacks, the backs of heads. I put them in a folder called “Crowns” because, from behind, people are mostly scalp and the idea made it less creepy.

On 07/3, I saw my handwriting on a sticky note in the corner of my bathroom mirror. It looked like a mirror’s version of me: familiar and wrong. It said:

ANYONE WOULD THINK YOU’RE CRYING IN HERE.

The handwriting wasn’t mine. It was pretending to be. The O’s had those tiny hearts, like a tell. It’s grotesque what your brain does with a detail like that. For the rest of the night, every O I typed looked like an opened mouth.

Kara came over and did a full sweep like we were in a procedural drama. She checked the air vents. She looked for pinholes in the walls. “You’re giving someone the show they want,” she said finally, trying to sound gentle and landing somewhere resentful. “If there’s anyone at all. You’ve lost weight, Soph.”

“I’m eating,” I said. (I wasn’t. I was gnawing. There’s a difference.)

“You’re sleeping?”

“Yes,” I lied.

She looked at my couch. The pillow had a sweat shadow in the shape of a skull.

“Let me stay.”

“I don’t want you to think I’m crazy,” I blurted, and then laughed, and then cried in the bathroom with the faucet running so Kara wouldn’t hear the shape of it.

The next night we set the trap like we were twelve: a glass of water balanced precariously atop the door, hair across the drawer, tape on the deadbolt, salt sprinkled on the kitchen floor to dust for footprints like detectives who couldn’t be bothered to buy powder. We huddled in my room with the lights off, whispering until whispering turned into jerky laughter.

At 2:44 a.m., the front door clicked. A careful click. Not the crash of our paranoia rewarded. Just a careful click, like thirty other nights. The water didn’t fall. The deadbolt tape was intact. The salt looked smooth.

At 2:48 a.m., the bathroom fan turned on by itself. It’s motion-sensing. Sometimes it’s finicky. Kara whispered, “Maybe your pipes are haunted.”

We lay there and watched the ceiling. Every distant door slam in the building. Every elevator shudder. Every dawn bird that mistook the city’s light for the sun and started early. Kara fell asleep snoring lightly at 3:10. I lay awake until 5 before exhaustion took me to sleep.

The sticky note the next morning said:

LOVE THE SLEEPOVER. BRINGS ME BACK.

I took it to the building office. Gerry said, “Kids have too much access to prank supplies. We never had this problem with real tape.”

“I want the locks changed.”

“We can do that when there’s a turnover.”

“I want them changed now.”

“We don’t authorize one-off changes,” he said. “And anyway, if someone’s being a creep, changing the lock won’t stop notes under the door.”

“It was on my counter.”

He shrugged. He looked forty-seven and bored in unpressable pants. “Maybe your friend thought it was funny.”

The thing about losing your mind is that the world starts treating you like you already did. That’s the practical harm. The existential harm is that you start treating yourself the same way. You start leaving yourself little bribes: If I’m good for a whole hour, I can look through the peephole. If I finish this chapter, I can check the deadbolt tape. You bargain with your fear like it’s a toddler.

On 07/8, I followed a man into the grocery store on College because his shoes looked familiar. (Dark sneakers, white soles, a notch in the leather near the right big toe.) I pretended to examine green onions. He stood close enough to reach past me for cilantro. I could smell his gum, mint sharp, almost medicinal. He wasn’t looking at me. He was looking at the price. That’s not a thing I ever noticed before this: how hard some men look at prices. He took his cilantro and went. I watched the shape of his shoulders under his jacket and thought of photographs where something terrible has already happened but all anyone can see is light.

He turned right on Beatrice. I turned right on Beatrice. He cut across to the next block, and I followed from the other side of the street. Then he stopped at a laundromat and bent to tie his shoe. He wasn’t looking at me. I could have walked past. Instead, I stopped too, ten paces back, and pretended to check my phone. He looked up. We made eye contact that felt like a knife in the air between us. He frowned. He said, politely but confused, “Can I help you?” and I said, “Sorry,” and fled.

I went home and triple-checked the balcony Q-tip. It was missing. The door was still latched from the inside.

That same day, a maintenance notice went up in the lobby: Annual fire alarm inspection, 07/12-07/14. Entry to units between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. with notice. I circled the date on my paper calendar. I told myself this was normal, necessary. I told myself this was good, people with clipboards who aren’t allowed to be creepy. I told myself a hundred things. It was like trying to nail fog to the wall.

On 07/12, a man with a plastic visitor’s badge and a can of air stepped into my apartment for “15-20 minutes, tops,” to test the ceiling sensors. He had forearms like he lifted actual ladders, not the lightweight aluminum ones the company uses. He kept his baseball cap on, low. He said he needed to check the smoke detector in the bedroom too. When I said I’d follow him, he shrugged like, “Sure, whatever.” He took the smoke detector off its base with a twist and checked something I couldn’t see. Then he put it back with a harder twist, like a lid. He smelled like spearmint gum and faint cigarette smoke. 

When he left, I took the detector down myself. I stood on the stool Aiden had teased me about needing and reached up with both hands and tried to curry the plastic loose with my fingernail. I took the whole round plate off. There was nothing but the white belly of a standard unit and a printed date of manufacture. I felt stupid and paranoid. I wanted to cry. I put it back and it didn’t quite click. I had to wiggle it until it sat flush again. For the rest of the afternoon it blinked red every forty seconds like a little heart too slow to save anyone.

That night the sticky note said:

YOU’RE RIGHT. RED ISN’T YOU.

I don’t have space here for every small way I came apart. It wasn’t dramatic. It was a fine thread unspooling over two weeks while the world went on being its crisp self: buses huffed and sighed; pigeons bickered; a kid on my floor wore a dinosaur jacket with felt spikes and refused to go anywhere unless he could press his own elevator button. I kept working. I kept showering. (Sometimes I could feel the exact place an unfamiliar eye would stand if it could watch me: in the doorway, slightly to the right, where you can see the mirror without being in it.) I kept grocery shopping badly, as demonstrated by the notes. I kept checking my tape on the deadbolt and finding it torn, and I kept telling myself it must be my own hands. I kept sleeping with the TV on but woke anyway, bone-stiff from shivering in fights I mostly lost.

On 07/16, I snapped. I mean that in the most boring sense: something inside me just didn’t stretch anymore. I told my boss I needed a week. I packed a bag without my toothbrush because I had an irrational thought about someone touching the bristles. I booked a $102 room in a budget hotel near the Gardiner because I figured if you’re going to be watched, be watched where there are security cameras every ten feet and men in suits practicing their neutral faces for meetings.

I told no one where I was going. Not Kara. Not my parents. Not the “Please text when you get home” group chat comprised of three people who all live in different time zones and therefore know how to say “love you” without punctuation. I felt guilty about that. Then I felt guilty about feeling guilty. Then I drank two tiny hotel vodkas and fell asleep in sheets that smelled like industrial citrus.

At 2:03 a.m., my phone buzzed.

UNKNOWN: If you're going to hide, you should book a place with better curtains.

I lay there with the phone lighting the bottom half of my face and actually argued with myself about whether to turn on the bedside lamp. Turning it on would make me a silhouette. Not turning it on made me a target for whatever was already in the dark. People always say that in stories. It sounds ridiculous. But it’s true in your body: the dark is a physical thing sitting on your chest.

I texted back before I could stop myself: Who is this?

The three dots came up immediately. Then:

UNKNOWN: You don't lock your balcony door. Not well.

I was on the 12th floor. The balcony was a pane of glass facing the highway and the cold. I stood up from the bed and felt my knees go wrong. I pulled on my coat and my shoes while texting 911 with shaky thumbs. I was on the phone with a calm woman who kept me repeating the hotel name when someone knocked, quick and polite. The fire alarm on the ceiling tinked once, like a spoon against a glass.

“Ma’am? Security.” A man’s voice through the door. Different from Aiden’s timbre but same flat politeness. “Everything okay?”

“Ma’am?” A pause. Longer. Softer. “Sophia?”

I opened the door.

Despite everything screaming at me to not open the door, I opened the door because he knew my name and said it like we were in a conversation already. The man in the hall wore the hotel jacket and a lanyard and had that same nothing face men wear when they expect to be bumped by a rolling suitcase. He took in the room behind me and then looked past me to the sliding glass balcony door and said, “You want to close that.”

The balcony door was open a hand’s width. The winter air made a little ribbon of itself on the carpet.

He stepped in like he owned the space, and for a second, relief won. He shut the door hard enough to make the glass bounce in its track. He pulled the drapes shut. “Someone’s been on the balcony above,” he said. “There was snow kicked down. It hits the alarm sensors sometimes.” He shrugged. “Kids. Sorry you were disturbed.”

“Someone texted me.”

“Could be a prank.” He looked at my phone, my fingers clenched around it like a handle. “We can move you to another room.”

He led me down the hall to a new door and opened it with a clean beep of his master key. He glanced at the bed, the window, the neat hotel painting. He stood there like he was waiting for something, and then he said, “Take care of yourself, Sophia.”

He left. I sat on the edge of the new bed, shivering in a way that felt like each muscle was getting its own small bad news. I looked back at the text.

UNKNOWN: You're sweet when you panic.

There is a point past which you can’t be soothed anymore by rational explanations. It took me too long to get there. When I did, I packed my bag again, checked out, and rode in a rideshare with a driver who wanted to tell me about his cousin’s restaurant across town while I tried not to cry. I went back to my apartment at 4 a.m. because I wanted everything familiar.  Even the lousy parts. I wanted the alley’s hum. I wanted the elevator’s judder. I wanted to know my fear by its first name.

The deadbolt tape was torn.

The sticky note on my counter said:

HOTEL SOAP MAKES YOU ITCH. NEW LIP BALM THO. YES.

I walked into my bathroom and looked at my face. There was a red ring around my mouth where I’d been licking, nervous, then smoothing balm over the sore spots. I sat on the closed toilet and shook like I had the flu. When I could stand again, I pulled the smoke detector down. I held it in my lap like a baby while I pried at the seam with a butter knife. The plastic creaked. On the third try, it gave. The back plate came away in my hand.

There was a microSD card taped inside the dome with surgical tape.

It wasn’t a camera. But its presence was a gunshot in a winter field. It made all the birds rise at once. I set the detector down and stepped backward like it could explode.

Then I laughed. I laughed like a lunatic because I understood the trick: If I took the card out and went to anyone, Gerry, Kara, the police, what would I be showing them? A card I found in my own apartment in a place I could have put it. If there was anything recorded on it, the only thing it would prove is that my bedroom existed.

I sat on the floor and texted Kara: Please come over. It’s bad. I didn’t hit send. I stared at the three words “Please come over” and thought about how many times in my life I’d needed someone and made it sound like nothing. I deleted the text. I mean, he had my number. He had…I don’t know. Whatever he had.

At dawn, I went downstairs to the lobby.

Aiden was behind the desk. He looked up with his gentleness and then really looked. He came around the desk with his palms up like you do for a frightened animal. “Hey. You okay?”

I put the smoke detector in his hands.

He took it with care. He looked at the card and then he looked at me the way people do when they’re trying to put their face far away from their eyes. “Who else has the master keys?” I asked.

“Me. Gerry. The property manager. Cleaning contractors for move-outs. The fire inspection team for the week. I’ll go check the camera logs.”

“There aren’t cameras on my hall,” I said. “Remember? Privacy.” It came out mean. I didn’t mean it for him.

“In the lobby,” he said. “Stairwells. Elevator.”

He went behind the desk and scrolled. He took down timestamps like he was trying to keep them from evaporating. He said, “If you’ve been feeling weird at night, there’s a guy who keeps letting himself in from the alley exit. That door is supposed to lock. I’ll have Gerry fix it.”

“Who?”

“Hoodie. Ball cap. Looks down. After midnight, mostly.” He glanced at me. “It could be nothing. Food deliveries.”

“Food deliveries don’t go up in the elevator without calling.”

“Some do.” He hesitated. “Can I ask you a question?”

“What?”

“Have you dated anyone in the building?”

“What? No.”

“Anyone who-” he faltered “-had reason to make you want to feel watched.”

I thought about the embarrassing “Crowns” folder on my phone. I thought about the man at the laundromat, the way he’d looked at me like I was the problem, because I had been. I thought about my brain clutching a shoe notch like a relic.

“No,” I said. “I don’t stalk people.” It sounded weak to my own ears.

“I didn’t say that,” Aiden said.

“What do I do?”

“Move out,” he said, too quickly, like he regretted it immediately. Then, because that wasn’t helpful: “We’ll check the stairwells and the roof. I’ll walk you to your unit. Change your routines. Don’t go home at the same time. Don’t leave the balcony door unlatched.”

“I don’t.”

He didn’t argue.

That night I slept under the opera of my own pulse. At 1:12 a.m., the elevator thrummed through the wall. At 1:14, the motion-sensing bathroom fan clicked on, and I lay there staring at the ceiling, counting the red blink of the smoke detector like the metronome of a slow heart.

At 1:17, my phone buzzed.

UNKNOWN: You broke my eye. I forgave you. That’s love.

I turned on every light. I stood in the kitchen breathing with my palms flat on the counter until my fingers ached. I didn’t text back. I didn’t call the police. I put my phone into the refrigerator to shut it up. Not a permanent solution, but enough so I could hear anything else besides it. I took the butter knife and slid it into my sleeve. 

I opened my front door without letting the latch click, and then I shut it loudly, hard enough to make a show of it. I locked the deadbolt. I slid the chain. I went to the bedroom and shut that door quietly like I was tucking in a child. Then I got into the closet. I know: why not leave? Because I wanted to see his face. Because I wanted to know if the horror had a shape.

I sat in the closet behind winter jackets that smelled like last year’s snow and waited. At 1:39, the elevator hummed. At 1:42, my front door made a sound that was almost nothing, the tiniest accommodation of wood to metal. At 1:43, someone breathed.

I’ve thought about describing it better. About how a stranger’s breath in your home is a sound like a stray animal in a church but breath is breath. It’s proof that something else is living in the place where you are living. It was close enough to hear. It was near the bedroom doorway. It came with the smell of spearmint gum and cold air.

The tiny red light at the corner of my closet ceiling, the one I had stopped being able to see because it blinked so slowly, went dark, then bright: the smoke detector cycling. There was a snap of fingernails flicking the plastic. A weight settled on the edge of my bed: the crease of the mattress, the tiny sound of fabric protesting. A rustle near the duvet, a hand (I think) feeling the warm shape I’d left there with pillows under the covers like a bad movie. A sound that might have been a chuckle and might have been a breath caught on a stitch of cloth.

I waited until my legs shook uncontrollably. I waited until he got up. I waited until the weight of the bed released and the air in the room changed. He moved around like someone in a home he had learned by touch: a soft bump of knee to coffee table; the little finger taps on the doorframe as he passed. He paused in the hallway. The spearmint smell came closer. He put his face toward the closet, I think. The coats wavered around me and fell back like a sea. He scraped his thumb slowly across the closet door’s seam. Then he moved away.

The deadbolt slid with a sound like metal softly kissing itself. The door closed with that careful hush I knew so well. The chain was left dangling, a touch less straight than before.

I didn’t move for ten minutes. The closet turned into a world. When I opened the door, the apartment looked like a set after a scene: bed unruffled, kitchen red digital clock telling a lie about time. The sticky note on the counter said:

YOU’RE GETTING BRAVER.

That was the first time the police took me seriously. Not because of the note. Because of the audio. The old phone I’d shoved between two cookbooks on the shelf had picked up the deadbolt, the chain, the footfalls, the faint scritch of a thumb on wood, the whisper that sounded like, “Good girl,” or maybe, “Don’t curl,” like a sports coach telling someone to keep their form. (Tell me which is worse.)

An officer named Blevins came, looked at the microSD card, and shrugged, but when he heard the audio and saw the torn deadbolt tape and the chain slack, he stopped shrugging. “He knows the building,” he said. “He’s comfortable in here. He wants you to know he’s comfortable. He wants you to feel proud when he approves of you. That’s…that’s a thing.”

They dusted for prints. They found mine, Kara’s, and someone else’s partials on the bathroom door and the inside of the front door near the chain. They sent me to sleep at Kara’s place while they “secured the scene,” which turned out to mean “took pictures, added tape of their own, and told the property manager about liability.”

When I came back the next afternoon with two officers, the sticky note was gone.

“That’s a taunt,” Blevins said, looking at the clean counter like it was an insult. “He wanted to show he could be in here when he wanted. He wanted to show us that evidence is optional when you have a key.”

They asked for footage. The building had lobby video that showed Gerry propping the alley door open at 12:50 a.m. and bringing in two flats of canned paint. It showed Aiden arriving at 10:58 p.m. It showed the fire inspection company bringing ladders and cases during the day. It showed a man in a dark hoodie riding the elevator at 1:39 a.m. with his head down. He didn’t look up at the camera. He tapped a key fob and the light blinked.

“Who is that?” Blevins asked.

Gerry looked uncomfortable. “Could be a contractor.”

“At 1:39 in the morning?”

“Sometimes we do off-hours work.”

“Who has that fob?”

Gerry scrolled and scrolled. The list of fob assignments was a spreadsheet on a dusty office computer. “Master,” he said. “Master, master, master.” He widened the columns. “Looks like one of the master fobs wasn’t checked back in after the last fire inspection day.”

Aiden said, very quietly, “It wasn’t me.”

“We’re not saying that,” Blevins said.

Aiden folded his arms across his chest and stared through the glass like the alley could give him an answer if he just focused hard enough.

“Do you recognize the shoes?” I asked, before my brain could stop me from asking the dumbest question in the room. 

Gerry said, “Shoes are shoes.”

Aiden looked at me and then looked at the screen. “He drags his right foot a little. You hear it?” He rewound. The sound was faint, but it was there: the smallest, irregular scrape on every other step. “That’s not a contractor. Contractors wear steel toes and walk like they have a schedule.”

“Who walks like that?” Blevins asked.

“Guys who don’t want to be noticed,” Aiden said. He hesitated. “Kids who used to shoplift. Guys who’ve done time.”

“You sure do have opinions,” Gerry said, fake-light. “Want to do my job too, buddy?”

“I’m doing it,” Aiden said.

That night I went to Kara’s anyway. The apartment felt like a mouth with a tongue in it that wasn’t mine. Kara made pasta and slid me a bowl and we watched garbage on TV. We laughed at a thing that wasn’t funny. We locked her door with both deadbolts and put a chair under the handle like we were seventy and living somewhere our bones were the only locks that mattered. I slept. I dreamed about shoes scuffing dust the color of ash.

At 3:07 a.m., my phone buzzed.

UNKNOWN: Isn’t it cozy to have a friend? You breathe quieter when you share.

Kara’s bedroom door was closed. I listened. I heard her, even in sleep, the little whistle she’s had since we were nineteen. I typed back before I could talk myself out of it: What do you want.

He answered:

UNKNOWN: To be let in.

I didn’t sleep again. We ate pancakes at dawn at a place where the tables are always sticky and the syrup bottle caps are welded with sugar. I took a nap at noon. When I woke up, there was a voicemail from Blevins. They had a name.

The man with the hoodie and the master fob was one of the fire inspection contractors. Not the one who’d come into my unit (that guy had a signed form with my signature and a time stamp that matched my memory). Another guy. A man named Colin with a record for trespassing and a sealed juvenile file that used to be an open joke in his family: “You know how teenagers are.”

They found him two days later because he went back to the building at 1:14 a.m. like terror had a calendar. Aiden saw him on the camera and didn’t wait. He went up the stairs to the sixth floor instead of taking the elevator, because you can hear a person coming on stairs. He met Colin at the top landing and didn’t do something heroic; he just said, “Hey, man,” in a voice that made my throat close when I heard it on the audio later. He talked like talking was a rope he could throw.

“What?” Colin asked, like he’d been woken from a nap.

“Walk with me,” Aiden said. “Let’s get some air.”

They walked down together because Aiden knows the building’s bone-familiar sounds: the difference between elevator hum and the click a decade-old fire door makes when it hasn’t been oiled enough; the rackety laughter from the unit with the three guys who live like season 2 of a TV show where nobody learns lessons; the hiss of the boiler; the thin, sharp cry of the new baby in 2B. They walked through the lobby under the chalkboard that said WELCOME HOME in cursive. They walked out into the alley where the dumpsters wear graffiti like tattoos. Then they turned left instead of right, which is important, because left is where the alley widens into a crook of shadow behind the café, and the security camera above the door has a blind spot there.

Aiden said, “Give me the fob.”

Colin said, “You’re not a cop.”

Aiden said, “No. I’m a witness.”

There’s a kind of silence in police audio that isn’t really silence. It has a shape. It makes its own weather. Then there was the sound of a scuffle: a squeal of rubber on grit, a curse. Then Aiden huffed, “Don’t,” and someone else said, soft, “Okay,” like he didn’t mean it.

When Blevins walked me through it later he kept his voice flat, like telling me a recipe. I think he was being kind. Aiden is okay. He has a line of purple on his forearm and a new dent in his watch. Colin had a flashlight in his pocket that wasn’t just a flashlight. It had a camera lens embedded where the bulb should be. The police found a small hard case in the trunk of his car with eight microSD cards neatly labeled with dates and unit numbers, and a folded paper napkin that smelled like coffee and the alley.

Some of the footage was mine.

He’d breathed in my hallway. He’d sat on my bed and watched the red light blink and blink and blink. He’d filmed himself writing notes on my counter with my pen, his hand careful and neat, and each O like a mouth open halfway in surprise.

He had other footage too. The old woman on 3A who takes naps in the afternoon with the TV volume high. The couple on 7D who fight and then have quiet, exhausted sex, a rhythm like rowing. The kid in 5C who leaves his coins lined up on his desk and cries when they fall. He had captured the everyday exhale of the building. He had captured me in the shower with the mirror fogged but not fogged enough, and I watched ten seconds of that before I leaned forward and threw up in a police station trash can, which is as undignified as it sounds.

They arrested him. There will be charges. There will be a trial, I’m told. There will be words like “pattern,” “prior,” “intent,” and “escalation.”

There will be a paper that says “order of protection” and “no contact” and a date. There will be a morning I wake up and a door will click again, and I will not know if the sound is my memory or a new breath. That’s not drama. That’s statistics. A man like that does not start and stop in neat lines because a pair of handcuffs drew a box around him. He slows, maybe. He redirects. He learns to look up at cameras.

People have been very kind since it made the rounds in the building. They bring me muffins. They say, “I never would have guessed; he looked normal,” and I say, “Everybody looks normal under fluorescent lights.” Kara cried and apologized like she’d been the one who taught him how to tape a card inside a detector. 

Aiden bought me a red sweater and left it at the desk with a sticky note that said, “You can pull it off.” I laughed so hard I startled a man waiting for a courier. I laughed because the O’s on his note were round and empty, just O’s, and because the sweater is a color I would never choose.

The building replaced every lock. They moved me to a unit on the other side of the floor so my windows look over the street, not the alley. I keep my curtains open at night and watch the lights slide across the ceiling as cars pass. It feels like the city is washing over me on a loop. It feels like breathing alongside something big.

Here is the part of the story I don’t know what to do with: even after the arrest, even after the evidence, there’s a part of me that thinks about the men I followed for blocks and the way their shoulders set when they felt me behind them. There’s a part of me that remembers how that felt, the heat of being the eye instead of the animal, and is ashamed. There’s a part of me that can’t stop wondering what attention looks like to someone like him when the thing you want most is a door opening softly.

“You can live in the world again,” Blevins told me when he dropped me off. “People don’t have to be the shape of your fear.”

I’m trying. I put plants on my window ledge and bite the dead leaves off with my fingers and feel proud. I cook ridiculous, messy things and leave oil splats on the stove and don’t wipe them off right away. I let my shoes get scuffed. I bought green onions and ate them raw over eggs. I close the door and let it click however it wants.

Sometimes I wake up at 1:43 a.m. and go stand in the hallway and listen to the building breathe. Sometimes the bathroom fan clicks on by itself and I laugh. Sometimes I put a sticky note on my own counter that says something kind: YOU DID ENOUGH TODAY. YOU ARE NOT AN ANIMAL IN A CHURCH.

And sometimes my phone buzzes at a time when it shouldn’t, and I throw it into the refrigerator out of habit. Old tricks for new days. I always take it out. I always check.

There are no more texts. Just notifications from my banking account or an email from a website I keep meaning to unsubscribe from.

There is a crumpled napkin inside my front door, though, wedged so it fell when I opened it yesterday, after work. The napkin is blank. It smells like coffee and alley air. Not impossible, there’s a café downstairs, but specific.

I stared at it for a long time with my coat still on and keys in my hand. Then I folded it in half and in half again and in half again until it was a compact, damp square that will not come unfolded without force. I slid it under the toonie on the shelf. I didn’t take a picture. I didn’t add it to a list. I just let it be the size it is.

Because here is the very last thing I learned: a person can be both wrong and right at the same time for a very long time. I was wrong to make the city smaller by carving it into threats with my eyes. I was right to listen to the parts of the night that were not my own.

If you’re reading this because you think you might be crazy, I don’t know what you should do. I’m not an expert. I’m not a movie. I can only tell you what I did: I paid attention until the day the attention pointed to something other than me. I made a record. I told the truth even when it made me look bad. I learned the sound my door makes when it is closed carefully from the inside by someone who is not me.

It is a small sound. But it is everything.
