Hi Reddit,

I never thought I'd be writing here, but something has been happening to me, and I don't know where else to turn. I recently found an old letter while cleaning out my late grandfather's house. My father and his dad never had the best relationship, nor did Grandpa Harold take part in my childhood. But shockingly he left me his home in Frost Hollow. After a recent break up with my long term boyfriend I couldn't have been more thankful for a place to call my own. I guess I should get back to this letter...

It was hidden away in a box of his belongings, and reading it sent chills down my spine. Now, strange things are happening to me, and I need to share this with someone. The letter was dated January 3, 1945, and written by my grandfather, Harold Thompson. It tells a story that seems almost unbelievable, but with what I've been experiencing, I'm starting to think there might be some truth to it. Here’s the letter in its entirety:


The winter of 1942 was one of the harshest I'd ever experienced in Frost Hollow. The snow fell in relentless sheets, burying our village under a blanket of white that seemed to grow thicker with each passing day. Food was scarce, and every day was a struggle to survive. I, Harold Thompson, had been a hunter all my life, but that winter, my traps were empty, and my rifle silent. The forest, once teeming with life, had turned against us.

Max, my Golden Retriever, had been my loyal companion for years. He had a bright, playful spirit and brown eyes that sparkled with intelligence. We had faced many hardships together, but now, I could barely keep myself fed, let alone my faithful friend. As the days grew colder and the nights longer, I found myself faced with an impossible decision. My heart ached with every beat, the gnawing hunger and the weight of my choices pressing down on me like a leaden shroud.

One particularly bitter day, after a long and fruitless hunt, I made the decision I had been dreading. With shaking hands, I loaded Max into my truck and drove deep into the forest. Snow danced around my truck to the music of the forest. The drive was silent except for the occasional whimper from Max, who seemed to sense something was wrong. I had no words to comfort him; my throat was tight with guilt and sorrow. When we reached a clearing, I stopped the truck and opened the door. Max looked at me with confused eyes, but I couldn't meet his gaze.

"Go on, Max," I said, my voice barely more than a whisper. "You're better off here."

He hesitated, then slowly stepped out of the truck, his eyes never leaving mine. I climbed back into the truck, started the engine, and drove away without looking back. The sound of the wind and the crunch of snow beneath the tires were the only things I could hear. The further I drove, the heavier my heart became. I had betrayed my best friend, and I knew I would never forgive myself.

The days that followed were a blur of cold and hunger. Every night, I would sit by the fire, staring into the flames and thinking of Max. The villagers of Frost Hollow noticed the change in me, but they didn't know the reason for my sorrow. They had their own struggles to contend with, and we rarely spoke of anything beyond the immediate concerns of survival. The forest had become a place of fear and mystery, with strange occurrences reported by those brave enough to venture into the woods.

Hunters spoke of shadows that moved on their own and eerie sounds that echoed through the trees. Some claimed to have seen a large, golden creature with glowing eyes watching them from the underbrush. Whispers of the Wendigo spread through the village like wildfire, rekindling old fears and superstitions. The once bustling community grew quieter, the people wary and on edge.

One night, as I sat by the fire, nursing a bottle of whiskey, I heard a scratching at the door. My heart leapt, and I stumbled to open it, hoping against hope that Max had found his way back to me. There, standing on the porch, was Max. But this was not the dog I remembered. His eyes glowed with an unnatural light, and his once friendly demeanor was now cold and distant. Relief quickly turned to fear as I realized something was very wrong. Max stood silently, staring at me with those eerie eyes.

Before I could react, Max turned and walked away, disappearing into the shadows of the forest. Compelled by a force I couldn't understand, I followed. The forest was deathly silent, the only sound the crunch of snow under my boots. Max led me deep into the woods, to a clearing I had never seen before. The trees seemed to close in around me, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. In the center stood the Wendigo, its tall, gaunt figure looming in the darkness.

My breath caught in my throat as I faced the creature. The Wendigo's glowing eyes bore into me, and its voice echoed in my mind. "You abandoned him," it said. "You left him to die. Now, he is mine."

Tears streamed down my face as I fell to my knees, begging for forgiveness, for mercy. The Wendigo shook its head slowly. "There is no forgiveness for what you have done. He is bound to me now. But you... you will pay for your sins when he chooses."

With that, the Wendigo disappeared into the darkness, taking Max with it. I was left alone in the clearing, my heart heavy with the weight of my actions. I returned to the village, but I was never the same. The once proud hunter now moved through life as a shell of his former self, haunted by the knowledge of what he had done. The villagers noticed the change in me, the haunted look in my eyes, but I never spoke of what had happened in the forest.

Years later, on cold, winter nights, I would sometimes hear scratching at my door. I never opened it, fearing what I might find on the other side. The tales of the Wendigo were no longer just stories to me; they were a reminder of a silent friend lost to the darkness of the woods, a friend I had betrayed. And in my heart, I knew I would never be free of the Wendigo's curse. The forest had claimed my soul, leaving me to live with the eternal torment of my guilt and the chilling knowledge that somewhere, out there in the dark, Max still served the Wendigo.

As the years passed, the scratching at my door became more frequent, more insistent. Each time, I resisted the urge to open it, fearing the confrontation I knew awaited me. But the guilt and the loneliness wore me down, eroding my resolve like water on stone. One particularly harsh winter night, when the wind howled like a pack of wolves and the cold seemed to seep into my very bones, I finally gave in. The scratching was louder than ever, a desperate plea that I could no longer ignore. With trembling hands, I opened the door.

Max stood there, his eyes glowing with that familiar, eerie light. But there was something different this time—a sense of urgency, of finality. He turned and began to walk away, and I knew I had to follow. The forest, cloaked in darkness and snow, felt like a tomb. The trees whispered in a language I couldn't understand, their skeletal branches reaching out to me. Max led me deeper and deeper into the woods, to the same clearing where I had first encountered the Wendigo.

The creature was waiting, its gaunt figure even more menacing in the moonlight. The Wendigo's eyes burned into mine, and its voice, a cold whisper that seemed to come from all around me, filled my mind. "You have come to face your fate," it said. "Your sins have brought you here."

I dropped to my knees, my heart pounding in my chest. "Please," I begged. "I am sorry for what I did. I never meant to abandon him."

The Wendigo's expression remained unchanged. "There is no forgiveness. Only retribution."

With a swift, inhuman movement, the Wendigo reached out and placed a skeletal hand on my forehead. An icy coldness spread through my body, and I felt my strength draining away. My vision blurred, and the last thing I saw was Max, his glowing eyes watching me with a strange, mournful expression.

When I awoke, I was alone in the clearing. The Wendigo and Max were gone, but I felt different—hollow, as if a part of me had been taken. I stumbled back to the village, my body weak and my mind haunted by the encounter. The villagers looked at me with a mix of pity and fear, but I had no words to explain what had happened.

From that day on, I was a shadow of my former self, a man marked by the forest and its dark secrets. The scratching at my door ceased, but the memories remained, a constant reminder of my betrayal and the price I had paid. The forest had claimed its due, leaving me to live with the eternal torment of my guilt and the knowledge that I had been judged and found wanting by the Wendigo and the silent friend I had lost.



Since finding this letter, strange things have been happening to me. On cold, winter nights, I've heard scratching at my door. At first, I thought it was my imagination, a trick of the wind. But the scratching is real, persistent, and growing more insistent. I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to open the door, to see if there's any truth to my grandfather's story. But another part of me is terrified of what I might find on the other side.I don't know what to believe anymore. Is this some kind of family curse? Am I losing my mind? If anyone has any advice or has experienced something similar, please let me know. I feel like I'm living in a nightmare, and I don't know how to wake up.
