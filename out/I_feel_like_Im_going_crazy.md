I’m a nightshift security guard that patrols about 4 times a night at a flooring factory. There’s not any 3rd shift employees so I’m completely alone, but that’s just to give some visuals for this.

When I’m not on patrol which is most of the time, I’m in a little guard shack thats right outside the fence so it can overlook the parking lot and the front of the factory. For extra security they set us up with cameras so we could watch the inside and outside of the factory while not on patrol. Granted I don’t watch them 24/7 because who the hell is stealing flooring in the middle of the night but, even if someone was, I’d notice the movement in the camera since I always catch it in my peripheral vision.

Now getting to the point, I’ve been doing this job for almost two years and it’s safe to say I know every single corner of the entire facility. I even have a map of the place that I got on the first day and I know for a fact I’ve been in every single room and hallway that there is. Last night though something weird happened, I saw a new screen was added to the cameras, it’s a room I’ve never seen before and sure as hell have never been to. At first I thought that it might be a place upstairs since I don’t go up there very often and maybe I just forgot about it. Sure enough though, I went on patrol and made a detour to check the entire upstairs area, nothing there resembled what was on the screen. Another weird thing was that the camera is titled (Employee hallway 2), which is weird because that would mean there should be another camera that would be titled (Employee entrance 2) since every hallway that’s on the cams also has a corresponding camera that’s watching the door specifically, but it just doesn’t exist. I did 2 extra patrols that night just to make sure that I’m not crazy.

When the next shift came around and I asked my coworker what the deal was with that camera, he said “what do you mean? Did you find something weird in the area?” That really threw me off because that would mean that he’s been there before and he thought I have too which is why he must’ve thought I wouldn’t have been talking about the camera but the area. At this point I started to feel sick, I told him that I had only noticed that camera that very day and he literally laughed at me and told me that I must’ve not been paying attention because it’s been there since they set up the cameras. I honestly felt too weirded out even respond and I just chuckled slightly and agreed. After that I just went home feeling insane, but I’m back tonight and the camera is still here.

I don’t know what the fuck is going on but I’m hoping this is all some sick joke from my coworker. At this point I’m not sure if I should just ignore it or ask my manager with the risk of seeming neglectful or getting some type of penalty for not patrolling every area, although I’m sure I’ve checked everywhere and I just don’t know what to do.
