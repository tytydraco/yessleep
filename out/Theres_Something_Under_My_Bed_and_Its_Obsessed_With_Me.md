I want to make something very clear before getting into this latest encounter. Everything is scarier when in the dark, when alone, or worst of all, when both of those are simultaneously true. These facts were made exceedingly clear to me over the past few days as I’ve made evident in my prior accounts.

What’s usually so frightening about finding yourself in these situations is that it leaves next to no distractions for your brain, allowing your imagination to run without a filter. Being alone strips away any sort of public awareness or social conscience you may otherwise operate under, and being in the dark removes a vital sensory ability that then makes the improbable seem possible.

Is there a monster in the closet? When the lights are on the answer is always no, because you can very clearly see the mundane reality. When the lights are off, however, there very well *could* be a monster lurking within. You can’t see the truth, so you can’t technically be sure. Even if it seems like an impossibility, the chances of a monster truly existing inherently increase when the room is cast in shadow.

I’m no stranger to this psychological reasoning for why many of us feel unnerved when alone in the dark. Children will often simply attribute it to the dark itself, but as I’m sure most of you have heard before, the phrase “people aren’t afraid of being alone in the dark, they’re afraid of *not* being alone in the dark” rings far more true. When we can’t prove to ourselves that we are really alone, we begin to fear for our lives.

Then, there’s a second layer to this. The fear of the unseen itself.

I know a lot of people who are very religious, and many of them place emphasis on a spiritual realm existing in tandem with our own. As we’re all familiar, most religions have themes of heaven, hell, or purgatory, or similar equivalents to these concepts. Main idea is that spiritual entities such as angels and demons exist in a different plane of reality that can only truly be accessed by us mortals when we die and our soul reaches an eternal destination. That doesn’t mean that the spiritual beings can’t interact with the physical realm, though; in a lot of interpretations, the idea of guardian angels is present, and certainly the capability for demons to tempt and deceive humanity.

I bring this up because under these types of beliefs even if you can physically see that you are alone, that doesn’t mean that you truly are, at least in a cosmic sense. This can be comforting in one respect; you can believe you have an angel or God watching over you at any given time, rooting for your health and wellbeing.  On the opposite side of things, this idea can be utterly terrifying; you could have a devil or horde of demons surrounding you, wishing upon you nothing but malice, and your physical senses may be completely incapable of alerting you to that fact. At other times, that unexplainable paranoia you feel might be able to be explained by this spiritual interference.

I say all of this because I can very vividly detect when my otherworldly stalker is watching me, but I can’t always see it. Furthermore, as my collision with it in the shower proved, it *can* have a physical presence if it so desires. That means I’m dealing with a being that can phase in and out of reality seemingly at will, one that can insert very specific thoughts into my mind as a method of communication. It doesn’t by any means seem to be an angel, and I cannot reconcile its behavior as strictly demonic either. As such, I’ve been laboriously theorizing on what this thing could be, and what it could want from me. I kept replaying its words in my mind over and over.

*“William, would you be at peace with dying? Would you trade your life in place of another?’*

I’m no longer certain that this thing wants to kill me, but I was very sure that whatever its purpose is, it *did* want me to die.

At least, I was. See, the most horrifically jarring moment of my entire life, *including* the past few days, occurred whilst I was comfortable in the safety of my bed. *I’ve seen it now.* Oddly enough, it came attached to a declaration of love.

As I concluded with in my prior post, I went to bed early the other night while daylight was still around, hoping to get a good sleep in before the hellscape that nighttime had become for me. I succeeded in peacefully falling asleep in the rays of sun that were steadily growing fainter outside my window, exhaustion from the sleeplessness I’ve recently gone through making it quite easy. Unfortunately, this unusually early rest ended right in the height of the night.

I can’t quite remember it now, but I feel like I was having some sort of dream when I awoke. Surprisingly, it wasn’t a nightmare, as I wasn’t particularly unnerved when I opened my eyes, but more bewildered and groggy. As is commonly the case, the specifics of this dream elude me; when I really try to remember, I feel like I see flashes of sunlight shining through glass, feeling warmth despite the memory of snow also coming to mind. Whatever the dream was, it’s not relevant to what I discovered when proper consciousness returned to me.

At first, all that was evident was the softness of my blankets and the firmness of my mattress, the bliss that comes with being consumed by one's own body heat momentarily protecting me from understanding. After blinking a couple of times and realizing my left hand was draped over the side of my bed, a sharp jolt of paralyzing horror shot through every inch of my body.

*Somebody was holding my left hand.*

My palm was unmistakably pressed against another, a set of fingers undeniably laced with my own. The other hand didn’t feel warm nor cold but exactly tuned to the temperature of mine, the skin of the other hand disturbingly smooth, yet entirely dry. The arm attached to the hand was definitely extending out from under my bed.

Words slithered into my mind once again, my hand still held firmly by the being under my bed: *“I love you, William.”*

I can’t fully describe every emotion and thought that plowed through me during this time. It was such a horrific moment to live through, yet so surreal that it doesn’t even necessarily seem like a true event upon recollection. What I *can* say is that once my senses returned to me, I viciously ripped my hand away, a meek shout catching in my throat as I rolled towards the other side of my mattress.

My heart thrummed against my chest with speed and power I had never known before, sweat beading down my face as I practically hyperventilated. My thoughts were scattered and disorganized and I couldn’t get a hold of any logical line of thinking for a long enough time to formulate any sort of plan. Some sort of protective instinct washed over me as I realized I was now facing the wall, my back towards the open room, and I felt an overwhelming desire to turn back around, be at least able to see what may attack me at any moment.

When I rolled back over, I had been fully prepared to see something looming over me, or something standing in the corner, maybe even that hand still reaching for me from underneath the bed. What I found was so much worse.

Completing the turn, I was met with a humanoid face staring right back at me.

 *The being was lying in bed next to me, our faces mere inches apart.*

I couldn’t see any identifiable features in the dark, but the overall shape of its body was definitely humanoid, perhaps slightly bigger and broader than anyone I had personally met before. My brain was instantly consumed by an intense buzzing sensation, aggressive warmth radiating across my skin, my eyesight beginning to cloud over.

*“William,”* the ghastly thought of my own name appeared inside my head once again, as my skull pounded with a sudden and violent headache, our eyes locked together. *“What is your worth compared to the worth of others?”*

I tried everything within my power to scream, to move, to do *something,* but I was locked in an unbreakable trance.

*“If it came to it, would you be willing to-”*

If I couldn’t fight against this terror physically, I would do everything in my power to will it away mentally. I’ve heard of warding off demons, of exorcising demonic forces, and while I didn’t know the methodology to any of that, I certainly used whatever power the human mind and spirit had to banish this entity from my home. Closing my eyes tight and putting every ounce of my mental fortitude into de-manifesting this being, I was painfully aware of my sheets getting drenched in sweat as all of my muscles tensed in unison.

After a few moments, I dared to open my eyes.

Nothing was there; I was alone in my room once more, and the trademark feeling of life-fearing panic this being induced had dissipated.

Thankfully, I didn’t have another run-in with it for the rest of the night, or in the morning (I admittedly skipped taking a shower). A part of me wants to believe I succeeded in banishing it from my house, but I know that’s probably too optimistic. In any case, I have some finals to finish up at college before the semester ends, so even if I *did* manage to banish it from my room/household, I have yet to see if it’s capable of haunting me at my campus. I’m writing this from the library, and while nothing has happened as of now, I have yet to experience nightfall at the college since this all began.

Whatever happens, contingent on my survival, I’ll have another update tomorrow.
