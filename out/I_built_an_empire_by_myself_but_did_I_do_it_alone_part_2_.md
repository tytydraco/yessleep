The morning after that nightmare was hazy. I woke up confused, staring at the three jagged lines on my right arm. The same marks that creature had left. But that couldn’t be, right? It was just a dream. I stood there in my bathroom, examining the wound like I was trying to convince myself it wasn’t real. Eventually, I wrapped a bandage around it, hoping that would make it go away, or at least make it easier to ignore.

I couldn’t shake the unease, so I sat down at my desk and searched the internet for hours—everything from dreams about creatures to devils and demons. I read countless articles and forums, most of them ramblings of people claiming to have been "touched" by something supernatural. Nothing seemed helpful, just a mess of myths and speculation. But it didn’t matter. I had to move on, couldn’t let this derail my day.

I hit the gym next, trying to clear my head, pushing myself harder than usual, as if I could sweat the fear out. After that, I had a meeting with some clients at a restaurant, so I cleaned up and headed there, still trying to push last night out of my mind.

The meeting was routine enough. I walked them through how I’d made my money, from selling goods online in my early days to transitioning into finance, stocks, and eventually foreign exchange. It’s all a numbers game, really. I figured out early on that this world works on leverage—who has it and who doesn’t. And the trick is always making sure you’re on the right side of that equation. Success isn’t about working harder, it’s about positioning yourself better than everyone else, and I’d done exactly that.

The two clients I was meeting, Mike and Dan, were older guys, both in their forties, seasoned investors with a string of businesses under their belts. They were proposing some investment opportunity—real estate mixed with tech ventures. The restaurant where we met was perfect for this sort of thing, upscale but not too pretentious. The kind of place where you can close deals over steak and wine with a breathtaking view of the city skyline. The walls were lined with deep mahogany wood, and the lighting was dim enough to make everything feel exclusive. Outside, you could see the river and the bridges glowing in the afternoon sun, while inside, the soft jazz music floated in the background, barely noticeable unless you really focused on it.

But despite the setting, the deal didn’t feel right. I sat there nodding along, but in my mind, I kept thinking, *These guys are wasting my time.* Their proposal wasn’t as solid as they thought, and it wasn’t good for me. While they rambled on about projections and profit margins, my eyes wandered, scanning the restaurant out of sheer boredom. That’s when I saw him.

An old man, seated just a few tables behind Mike and Dan. He was dressed in a sharp, black suit, perfectly tailored. He looked old, but not frail—there was something off about him. What really caught my attention, though, was his smile. It wasn’t friendly, more like he knew something I didn’t. And the worst part? He was staring directly at me. His eyes never left mine, as if he’d been waiting for me to notice him.

I tried to shake it off, return to the conversation, but every time I glanced back, there he was—still smiling, still staring. It got under my skin. I couldn’t take it anymore.

“Hey buddy, what’s your problem?” I snapped, glaring at him. “What are you looking at?”

Mike and Dan both stopped mid-sentence, surprised by my outburst. “What’s wrong?” Dan asked.

I gestured behind them, “That old guy, the one who keeps staring at me. What’s his deal?”

They both turned to look, but then Mike frowned. “Who? There’s no one there.”

I stared at them in disbelief. “That guy right there,” I pointed at the old man’s table, my voice rising. Heads started to turn, people at other tables looking at me now.

But when I looked again, the old man was gone. The table was empty.

“Seriously, man,” Mike said, laying a hand on my shoulder. “There’s no one there.”

I stood up, still pointing at the empty table, feeling the heat of embarrassment creeping up my neck. “But he was just sitting there, staring at me...”

People were starting to whisper, and I could feel the eyes of half the restaurant on me now. I tried to gather myself, but the confusion and panic were too much.

“You know what?” I said, brushing Mike’s hand off my shoulder. “This deal isn’t for me. I’m out.” 

Without waiting for a response, I walked out of the restaurant in a hurry, feeling both humiliated and deeply unsettled. My mind raced as I pushed through the crowds on the street. What the hell was happening to me? First the dream, now this. I couldn’t tell what was real anymore.

I eventually made it to my car and sped off to a bar I knew nearby. It was dark, a place where you could disappear for a while. The lighting was low, mostly from neon signs that flickered in and out. I sat at the counter, ordering a few shots, trying to calm my nerves. The whiskey burned going down, but it didn’t help. I couldn’t stop thinking about that old man.

As I sat there, staring into my glass, a voice to my right caught my attention.

“Tough day?”

I hadn’t noticed anyone sitting next to me, but now there he was. A man dressed all in black. His face was shadowed by the dim light, making it hard to make out his features.

“Yeah,” I muttered. “You wouldn’t believe me even if I told you.”

“Try me,” he said, his voice calm, almost too calm.

I didn’t want to sound crazy, so I kept it vague. “My brain’s playing tricks on me. I’m seeing things... things that aren’t there.”

The man nodded slowly. “Oh.”

He took a sip of his drink, then continued. “Do you know why people drink?”

“No,” I replied, still not really in the mood for conversation.

“People drink alcohol as a form of pleasure despite it tasting foul. But the more you drink, the less you notice the taste. It becomes an escape, a way to numb the harsh edges of life. Some use it to calm their soul after a hard day’s work, others to forget their problems... kind of like you.”

I glanced at him, confused, and then it hit me. I recognized him. He was the old man from the restaurant.

Panic gripped me as I stumbled back, knocking over my stool. He just sat there, smiling that same eerie smile.

In a blind rush, I bolted out of the bar and jumped into my car. My hands were shaking as I sped down the road, trying to outrun whatever nightmare had followed me out of that dream. But before I could make sense of any of it, there was a flash of headlights, the screech of tires, and then everything went black.
