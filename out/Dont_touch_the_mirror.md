I've always been told by my parents to not touch the mirrors. They never explained why, they constantly would look over me whilst in the bathroom, or any public place. I was never aloud to have a mirror in my room, never aloud to have a makeup mirror, nothing.

I'm 23 now, and they still come to my house every Saturday to make sure I haven't touched a mirror.
My husband asked me why they won't let me touch any mirrors, I explained that I've never been told why. He responds angrily, "Never a reason?
Seriously. This is bull shit. Just touch the one in my car, what could be so bad?" He opened the passenger side mirror up and pulled my hand up to it and told me to touch it. I was iffy to do so, because my parents have always told me not to, " don't think I should Mike." "Come on nothing too bad can happen, right?" I touched the mirror and all of a sudden it seemed out of sync.

The mirrored me wasn't doing what I was. "What the hell, Mike look." "What's wrong honey." "I'm out of sync in the mirror." "No your not?" "But I'm not doing that." "Your doing the same thing in both." " guess I'm just paranoid." Me and Mike went home I went to the bathroom to get ready for bed, I let out a loud shriek, my mirrored self had picked up the curling iron was rubbing its lips with it. My husb came rushing into the bathroom, "What the fuck Ashley?" "Do you not see what that thing is doing in the mirror!" It's doing the same thing as you!" "It's using the curling iron on its lips" "no it's not?" " know what I'm seeing, I'm not crazy." "Go to bed honey, you need rest." "I know what I'm seeing
Mike."

I went to bed, but when I woke up my lips felt chapped, badly, like worse than they ever had been.
I looked into the bedroom mirror and seen mirrored me slitting it's throat with one of our kitchen knifes, suddenly felt a deep pain in my throat. I didn't say anything cause I knew my husband would just say I was crazy. I went to get a glass of water from the bathroom, I looked in the mirror mirrored me was no where to be seen. I felt a sharp pain in my leg. Then I heard my husband scream.

I limped into our bed room where I found his chest bleeding with nothing stabbing him, I quickly turned to the mirror where I seen the mirrored me, stabbing my husband with the same knife she slit her throat with, I screamed loudly, then I noticed that there was a maybe 8 inch blade jabbed in her knee. I tried to move my husband away but she kept stabbing. I heard him stop breathing. I started crying, "this is all because I touched that stupid fucking mirror! This is my fault, mike I'm sorry." She then began repeatedly stabbing herself, I fell to the ground.

She started walking towards the mirror, she stopped at the edge of the dresser, and reached her hand toward the mirror, her hand went through it, she put her whole body through and walked towards me picked me up, then her husband walked through the mirror and grabbed my husband. They through us into the mirror, I went through the mirror and fell on the floor, me and my husbands wounds healed all of a sudden, but I couldn't control my body, she was controlling it. I've been in here for 4 days, only being able to right this at night while they're sleeping. I see why she did what she did, this is miserable, I have no free will except for the nights, I want out of here.
