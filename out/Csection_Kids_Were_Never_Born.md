That's what Sid told me. He's studying medicine, but he also has backwards ideologies and is a huge conspiracy theorist. I always take what he says with a grain of salt, and he's always fanatically persistent, this time even more so because he knew I was a c-section baby.

I told him of course I was born, I'm right here, aren't I? And he said I was alive, yes, but I never went through the birthing canal, and hence, I was never born.

I just wanted to drop the whole thing. I mean, who cares? I'm alive, I'm whole, I'm healthy. But Sid just kept on with it. He said that the tight squeeze into life was what broke the barrier between "unborn" and "born", and therefore, my body still believes it's in the womb.

We've been friends since childhood and I've humored more than my fair share of his insane beliefs over the years, but this was just too out there for me. Sid wanted to say more, but the moment he brought up my mother, I interrupted him, thanked him for the coffee, and left the diner. I didn't believe there was an inkling of truth in his words.

But an hour later, I knew I was wrong, and I should have listened to what he had to say about my mother.
 
I never had a good relationship with her. Her substance abuse made my life hell, and when I finally left home, I never looked back. No calls, no social media friendships, no mother's day cards. Nothing. She was dead to me. And I didn't care.

Until today.

She called me, crying, hysterical, and I froze when I heard a gunshot. Then the line went dead.

Chills trickled down my body as I called the police, conflicting feelings clashing within me. Fear, anger, worry. I may have hated her, but she was still my mother. We shared that connection.

But soon I realized we shared a lot more.

Not a half an hour later, I began getting lightheaded. Each breath became a chore and I started wheezing. Scared of what could be a deadly reaction to something, I called 911 again, barely able to whisper. They said they'd be here soon, and I fought my fears as I prayed they'd get to me on time.

As soon as I hung up, I received another call. My mother had died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.

Shock clashed with my distress, and a few seconds later, a realization left me dumbstruck.

*You were never born.*

*Your body believes it's still in the womb.*

My mother was my lifeline.

Now she was dead …

… and I was about to follow.

Fear flooded my stuttering heart as I frantically googled how long an unborn child could survive without their mother.

Barely minutes.

But I was an adult out in the world. Did that matter? Did all c-section kids drop dead when their mothers did? There was no way, right? It'd be all over the news! But then what was happening to me now? Right after my mother's death. Was it a conspiracy? I didn't know. All I knew was how desperately my lungs heaved as they begged for oxygen.

I'm lying down now , gasping, crying, trembling as I wait for the ambulance . It feels like I'm sufffocating from the inside out amd Im terrified. I dont want to die .

Im getting a call. Its Sid . Ill  ontinue writing after i tallk with hin..
