First of all, if you’re seeing this as a follow up to my panicked post last week about the tick I found on my left side: don’t worry, I got it off! Well, actually my girlfriend Liz removed it, since I couldn’t quite see well back there. I just felt an awful itch, and I could see its little legs wiggling out of the corner of my eye if I turned my head just right. So it was great we were together on this trip, though it was our first time out in any kind of wilderness together and I won’t lie saying it was easy!



Now that I’ve been home for about a week and had a little time to think back, I guess the tick must have gotten on my skin when we took that nap in the meadow. We specifically did an extra tick check when we got home because of that nap, but I guess we weren’t thorough enough! In trying to figure out the tick situation, I was going through our photos, and also realizing that it was actually an amazing trip, just this little snag at the end of it, and maybe the quarreling left a bad taste. So I wanted to give you the good parts, too, you know?



We stayed in a small, exceedingly cute town surrounded by freshwater lakes. The lakes are all beautiful and clear: there’s a lot of underground water movement among the whole system of lakes, and only a few slow bacteria are resident there, so there are just miles of trail with many beautiful swimmable coves. It’s really relaxing, but it’s also kind of exciting, because there are a few interesting ruins one can explore. The one Liz and I came across the first day was some kind of small Soviet office building, overgrown with trees, the windows knocked out, mushrooms growing between heaps of brick and plaster, but the outside still gleaming in spots with beautiful mosaic.



We had meant to get as far as a local decommissioned nuclear power plant, but it would have made our 7-hour round-trip hike into an 11-hour one, and that was more fun in theory than in practice. I was a bit disappointed, to be honest, I had been looking forward to see this particular plant. I know it’s just a couple of minimally-maintained buildings, but for some reason I really wanted to check it out. To be honest, I would have done the longer hike, but Liz started complaining when we were halfway there, that her feet hurt, and maybe her cramps are starting up. I didn’t want to be an asshole and argue about any of that, and anyway on the way back we found a wonderful meadow, where we ended up taking a really nice nap. Well, almost really nice. Mostly nice! That’s travel for you, I guess.



The problem is that even after a week, the bite still itches. Liz says it’s nothing to worry about by itself, just irritated skin, not an infection or anything bad like that, but I keep waking up having really scratched up my side. The rash keeps getting bigger, too; it was just a small red bump around the wiggling body of the tick, but now it covers a big chunk of my torso. Granted, I can’t see that much detail in the mirror, but it doesn't seem like any rash I’ve ever had, and it doesn’t seem like the dreaded bulls-eye either. If I look at it just right, it’s like there are lines from the center to the outside, like the radial striations of the underside of some mushroom caps.



Liz tells me not to be ridiculous, I’m just seeing things because I’m not sleeping well, and that’s true enough, I’m not. I haven’t really slept since that nap last week. I’ve never had any real sleep problems, but I keep being too energized to fall asleep, and, when I do, it doesn’t last long before I wake up because of the pain in my side where I’m scratching the area of the bite. Even though I haven’t been remembering any dreams, I think I must be having nightmares, because each time I wake, my heart is racing, and my body is sweaty and stiff.



Last night was the exception, though: I woke up and I remembered a bit of my dream. It was back at that meadow, and I could see the two of us lying there, but I could also see the layers of plant and soil beneath us, and everything below, like a cross-section of the outer skin of the earth: infrastructure pipes, the water of the lakes in underground streams, everything. I saw that just by my left side was something that looked like an ant hill. We did take selfies in the meadow, there was no ant hill, I checked! But, in my dream, this anthill was just a little bump near me at the surface, but a massive structure beneath the ground.



In the dream, I watched the ants - or what looked like ants in this hazy vision - start to crawl all over me. Then, I could see Liz wake up, stretch, roll over and look at my body, covered by ants. They didn’t crawl on her at all. At some point, she leaned over, lifted my shirt on my left side, pushed my bra strap a little up and over, and gave me a long wet kiss, almost a hickey, right on the spot where later I’d have the bite. In the dream, I was some ethereal observer watching us from outside, but I could also feel her warm mouth and wet tongue. When she lifted her head, she had left a tiny hole in my side. My dream self did not see it, but knew it was there: I felt it, like a needle piercing layer after layer of flesh. The ants that had been crawling all over me started pouring into this opening until I could see the layers of my own body, like the layers of the earth, teeming.



I know it’s just a dream, but this time when I woke up, I kept on scratching at the side until I made my own little aperture, and, again, I could swear I could see something wiggling just out of the corner of my eye, for just a moment, and then it was gone. I’m not sure whether I should let my weird dream affect how I approach Liz about all this. I feel even more drawn to that abandoned nuclear power plant, and she wasn’t interested in that anyway, so I’ll try as soon as I’m off work again long enough to get out to that little town for a couple of days.
