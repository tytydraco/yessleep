I visited some old friends and they didn't seem well. They tried to look happy, and talkative, like nothing happened, but I felt this was only a facade. 

After a bit of convincing, I got them to reveal the reason why they were so upset.

Every night, at 3 AM, they would wake up to see a man whose eyes were bleeding. He would sit there quietly. But scary. 

I asked them to allow me to stay for the night. I too, saw the man. But I wasn't afraid. Rather, I asked the spirit to tell me his story.

The man revealed he once owned the house, was a wealthy businessman, and was happily married. 

Then, one day, he and his family were kidnapped and tortured by a business rival.

He and his family were murdered in a black magic ritual. The family who did it were, and still are, virtually untouchable.

They have high-level connections and know many VIPs and politicians.

Only when they will pay, will this poor soul find rest, and rejoin his family on the Other Side. A revenge I wanted to carry for him.

I decided to target the whole family, by placing a curse. Each night, their beds would shake, and tremble, and they would see insects and snakes crawling all over the place.

The targeted family slowly became desperate. I contacted them and explained that, until they apologized to Jim, the eye-bleeding spirit, their terror would not stop.

But the family head, Tyler, threatened me. His son was involved in the occult. There would be a battle. Revenge would be enacted. 

One day, I heard Tyler begin vomiting blood. He filled the bathroom with it. He called his son. Asked him to do a spell. To confront me. I almost had a car accident. I felt sick like I had the flu.

I woke up one night to the smell of sulfur. I saw a man with fully white eyes, no pupils, and long, white hair. Its teeth were blade-like. This is what they sent. 

A battle ensued, when, using magic and prayers, I banished the demon. I knew I needed to fight them. 

I went to their house. Two bodyguards walked in front of me. With a curse, I had them explode in a sea of blood.

I saw two more bodyguards. I mentally made one of them turn his rifle to the other and fire. One down. The other one threw the gun and fled.

Tyler arrived, escorted by four more bodyguards and his son. I saw a lion whose eyes were dark as a black hole roaring. Just an illusion. I stood my ground, as the son threw another vision: I saw fire surrounding me.

I could feel its heat. But it was all in my head. I managed to dispel this attack as well. 

Tyler got a gun and swore he would never apologize. I needed to frighten them some more.

So I knelt. My eyes turned white. We could hear footsteps. We could hear them marching. 

They took shape, fully red eyes, no pupils. The son simply apologized, as they surrounded Tyler and him.

The creatures had talons and gray skin. Cold eyes. Tyler relented and apologized. He produced a contract and told me it was fake. He agreed to go to jail and pay for his crimes.

The creatures I summoned vanished, leaving behind a thick, dark smoke.

The cops arrived. Tyler would admit guilt and pay.

That night, we saw Jim again. But his eyes were no longer bleeding. He was at peace. I told my friends it was over.

I left them safe and left home. But when I got home, I saw scorpions crawling all over the walls and the floor. I knew it. I felt it. Tyler's son.
