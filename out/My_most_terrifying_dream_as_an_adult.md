I think my most terrifying dream is of the one of when I was living in my parents basement. 
Back in 2018 I was put through a series of unfortunate events that landed me back to my parents; now, they had no more room for me left due to the fact that my mother who was recently divorced got a new boyfriend with a kid. Anyways; I remember moving in again and having to live in an unfinished, dim lit and dusty basement with no windows. The walls were pure concrete, the ceiling also wasn’t finished; the only furniture that lay around were a washer, dryer, tv and ps4 accompanied by an old light brown couch which would become my bed. 


I remember every night I felt watched, I wouldn’t sleep sometimes, it was always in the corner. It was always in the corner, watching me, my every move and every word I spoke, at this time I wasn’t able to remember any dreams, and I never dreamt except the one time I remember from this time era. 
The dream was lucid, it felt like I left what felt like the simulation of the real world, this felt real. I was in my basement , frantically running up and down the stairs as a larger older man stood by the washer and dryer; looking at me, his face blacked out as I ran up and down the stairs shouting for my family to pack up and leave. After gathering multiple lamps and various items that made no sense I stood in the kitchen urging my parents to hurry up as the man began walking up the stairs; suddenly I was paralyzed, until the moment he got behind me and I had a sudden burst of energy and ran, making my way into the car. 


As we drove away; I suddenly saw the man in the middle of the road and he ran quickly towards the car and hit the front without flinching. I gasped as I woke up, checking my surroundings to see if anything could offer me some peace , but that corner, it grew darker, it’s gaze felt more intense, so I made my way upstairs only to find an odd glowing red light emitting from a ripple in the wall that was placed above our couch next to the old jukebox. I heard my name being whispered by a sweet feminine voice; it had listed me some rules to get away from him. 


The rules went as following 


1. He who watches mustn’t be watched or you will meet your fate 
2. Sleep for him, he wants to see you, he wants to feel you, if you do not let him you will regret it, you will forever be stuck in a dream. 
3. Do not put your guard down, remain strong, he will take advantage of you at any given moment, remember to not watch, but watch your back. 
4. Ignore knocking, he will knock to remind you of his presence, if you knock back, you will be brought to a place you will never return from. 
5. Get in bed before the sunrise. If you fail to comply, you will never see day again, everything will go black. 

After muttering the rules, she whispered softly one more time “goodnight darling we will watch you and make some changes as you drift off” 
As I stared into the luminescence of the portal like anomaly, I suddenly felt very tired and passed out on the floor. To my surprise, when I had woken up it was gone and I still ask myself what really happened once I fell asleep. 

To this day, I follow these rules, it has been 5 years since this has initially happened, I haven’t changed anything about what I do, now he watches me.. everywhere I go, if you purchase a home and feel a similar presence leave immediately, save yourself, once he gets attached he will not leave your mind…
