I want to preface this story by saying that while I am pretty much agnostic on a good day and an atheist on a bad day, I am a fan of horror and grew up in a fairly religious environment via a very evangelical Christian high school, so my point of view may be skewed by those influences. However, I do think whatever my fiance and I witnessed was at the very least, an extremely dangerous person.

For context, I started college in fall 2018, going to a university in a somewhat rural area. The college itself sits on a large plot of land surrounded by farmland and vineyards, with sections that are forested and have little trails running through them, and a creek that runs the length of school property. The college has even had a murder victim dumped in one of the wooded areas on campus, but that’s a story for another day. 

Freshmen were required to live on campus their first year and one of the benefits of that was that we had unlimited access to the school cafeteria, aka the caf. The caf was pretty nice, boasting a salad bar, sandwich station, mini bakery, hot food with different menu’s daily, and pretty much every fountain drink you can think of. I would get lunch and dinner there with my only friend at the time (and who is now my fiancé), and we began to notice this boy who was always at the caf alone. It wasn’t uncommon to see students eating there alone, my school had pretty poor community outreach/ school spirit, but something was really off about this kid. 

First off he had a very distinct look (this is important because we recognized him multiple times over 3 years), his skin was extremely pale and had this heavy, fleshy look to it that I struggle to describe, like he was made of wax, he had red curly hair (insert ginger joke here), a mouth a little too large for his face, but what was the strangest thing about him was his eyes. They were the same color as his hair, that bright red auburn, his iris was almost too big for his eye, and his pupils were always extremely dilated. His eyes had a bulging look, very similar to Mark Zuckerburg, like they were trying to escape his face. It’s hard to describe here but he just had a very unsettling look to him, it just felt that there was something very wrong, like there was nothing inside him. 

But his appearance wasn’t what caught our attention at first, what caught our attention was the amount of food this kid could eat. Of course, having unlimited access to food some kids went overboard, but this kid was another level. He always had 5 or 6 cups of juice, soda, coffee, and 3-4 plates piled with food. Mind you, he was not large or overweight, but he would clear every plate and then just sit in his booth alone, staring into space with his headphones in. That was another thing, he always had this blank, vacant expression, always staring into nothing. Whenever you walked past his booth you could hear that the music from his headphones was on full blast.

We began to notice that no matter what time we went to the caf, whether it be for a late-night snack, breakfast, a random afternoon craving, he was always there, sitting alone in the ruins of his empty plates. And we weren’t the only people who noticed his strange behavior. By second semester, people began approaching him, at first just some girls jokingly saying something to the effect of “we strive to be on your level,” referencing his eating habits, and he just stared at them blankly. People began to ask if he was ok, if he would like to join them, but he always just stared, sometimes with a knowing smile on his face, but would never reply, leaving the students to depart awkwardly. Once I even witnessed one of the caf attendants telling him he needed to stop spending all his time there.

My friend that I always ate with became my boyfriend, and we began to theorize what exactly this kid’s deal was. We said maybe mental illness, or maybe he was a competitive eater, or he was trying to bulk up, but his behavior seemed too empty, too neurotic to be explained away by any of these. Our main theory, the one I subscribe to now, did not come till much later. 

My sophomore year I opted to live on campus again, and in the middle of my second semester, COVID hit. My school allowed us to remain on campus until the school year was up, and due to some personal reasons of not wanting to go home, I remained in my dorm, and my boyfriend joined me and we quarantined together. That time was so strange because our campus became an incredibly liminal space without all the other students. Some others remained with us, but on any given day you could walk the entire campus and not run into another soul. My boyfriend and I started running the wooded trails on campus to get exercise. 

One day we stopped on one of the trails to do some burpees. As we did so, the kid from the caf, emerged from some trees, not on any trail, just walked out of the woods and started running toward us. This really caught us off guard because we rarely saw anyone, and he just maid a beeline toward us. RIght as he ran up on us he stopped. Just smiled at us knowingly, as if we shared some joke, but it was not a nice smile, it was incredibly nasty, sinister even. I don’t know if I felt that way because he had scared us, but something was off. We had never spoken to him those times at the caf but he seemed to recognize us. The other thing that was weird was that he was jacked, way taller and just larger than he ever had been freshman year. It wasn’t just that he gained muscle mass, he just seemed like scaled up, like he hit a massive growth spurt, which I suppose is plausible, but it just seemed really off. 

We were both shaken by the experience and began to joke that he had been eating so much to store up energy so he could level up or something. Then one of us, I forget which, suggested he looked so strange because it was a demon wearing a human’s skin and was eating so much to build strength for his demonic powers, and that’s how he grew so quickly. Like I said it began as a joke, but the more we discussed it, the more it just seemed to explain not only his odd appearance but his odd behavior toward other students, the empty look in his eyes.

Here’s where things went from weird to fucking terrifying:

My boyfriend and I forgot about him, and we moved out of my dorm into an apartment a few blocks from school as we were still finishing, and while school was mostly online now, I liked the area. The same creek that ran the length of our school campus ran behind our complex, and as it was still COVID lockdown and we had nothing to do, we would go on long walks up and down the creek.

One evening we went for a walk at dusk and by the time we got to the main road our apartment was on it was completely dark. It was extremely quiet, and as we walked along the road we saw we were coming up on a man walking very slow and deliberate. My hackles were up immediately as our apartment is in a seedy area and there were a lot of homeless and unstable people who sometimes hung out around the creek. And there was just something about his walk, it was so deliberate, and predatory. As we crossed paths with the man he walked even slower, and in the dim light of streetlamps I realized I recognized him as that same kid, that same waxy face, and bulging eyes. I also realized that in one hand he held a paper bag with something big and round in it, while in the other he held a crowbar. A fucking crow bar. He slowed down even more as he passed us and turned his whole head and smiled at us. This time there was no mistake when I tell you it was the most threatening, sinister smile I have ever seen, and it had that same knowing in it, like he knew us and we shared some joke. He didn’t say anything, just stared at us with his horrible eyes. I don’t know if I’ve just read too many creepypastas or if I’m overthinking things, but I knew on an animalistic level he wanted to hurt us and wanted us to know he could.

After we passed him, we took off running, and when we returned to the apartment, we were both in a full-blown panic, even my boyfriend who tends to be pretty levelheaded and skeptical wanted to call the police. We did and as soon as we began to explain the situation, we felt pretty foolish. They asked if he threatened us, and we said not verbally but we felt threatened. Despite the absurdity of our call they said they would look into it because obviously there’s not a lot of non-nefarious reasons to be walking around at night with a crowbar. But we never heard anything, and we never saw him again.

To close this, I just think the whole thing is strange, how this kid kept showing up in our lives over 3 years, and always seemed to recognize us, always seemed to want to let us know he knew us. I think as people we know when there’s just something off about a person, when there’s nothing going on inside. People have said as much about sociopaths they’ve had run-ins with. But I want to know what you guys think, did I encounter the Antichrist leveling up? A demon? Or a really troubled kid who became a dangerous man? Maybe he was just a depressed kid, but I will hold firm that we were, at the very least, threatened by this guy, that we wanted to hurt us, and that we encountered something or someone evil. What do you think?

P.S. I did some rudimentary google searches for police reports in the area for assault with a crowbar, and some other things that might had related but could not find anything.
