After learning about a few ritual games yesterday, and seeing multiple Reddits that post these games online, I thought I'd share one that I performed as a little kid. I did not see it on this Reddit already, so I decided that I should be the first one to share here. Like all the other games, PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK. You will have everlasting memories about it and may potentially die. This is highly dangerous. It may be too much to handle. It will test your strength and it could take it from you even if you're just a little bit thanatophobic. You may become weak and the facade you put on every day to seem like you don't fear death will shatter. You may even become afraid and retreat. You may think about everything you've done in your life, and all the wonderful things you've achieved, and feel guilty, sad, and remorseful for choosing to do this. Just don't do it. For the sake of your life, please don't do this. 

This ritual dates back to the late 19th century, according to a friend of mine who likes to research history and occult-related stuff. My friend (let's call her Maria) states that nobody really plays it anymore and that it has gone out of style. She introduced me to it at a slumber party and dared me to perform this. The objective here is to summon a ghost train, as you can tell by the title of the ritual game. You do so by whistling at night. They are beholden to no earthly schedule and are in charge of transporting souls to the afterlife. The train driver is none other than The Grim Reaper himself. You will know that you have summoned a ghost train if you hear something whistle back. You may also hear additional noises such as a scream that can only be described as that of a banshee, La Llorona, The Ankou, etc.; the sounds of someone being murdered; sounds that will fill you with fear and hopelessness; and indescribable things that do not fit in any sort of category. You may also feel a powerful, heavy, dark, but not exactly evil (unless you perceive The Grim Reaper to be evil) presence. You also may feel like you're not able to breathe for a few seconds as chills run down your spine, smell the sickly sweet scent of death and decomposition, or just feel extremely cold throughout your entire body. But you won't be able to see the train unless you're able to see the dead.

You can only perform this at a set of train tracks that are directly in front of a cemetery or graveyard. Note that it is illegal to access private railroad property anywhere other than a designated pedestrian or roadway crossing, not to mention dangerous. If you don't want to get caught doing this, also make sure that it is abandoned. I'd also recommend taking a lantern or flashlight with you to help you light your way, a vehicle to drive just in case you can't reach the tracks by walking, and warm clothes if it's slightly chilly outside. Got all that? Okay, let's begin.

# Directions:

1. **When it is dark, and when you believe that it's The Devil's Hour and feel that it is the perfect time, take your stuff with you and go to the set of train tracks.** If you drive there, park your vehicle someplace safe before proceeding.
2. **Walk until you're on top of the train tracks.** Use your source of light so you don't accidentally trip and fall in the dark.
3. **Walk a mile leisurely.** Do not get tired and do not run out of breath, just walk normally.
4. **Now, purse your lips and begin to whistle.** Make a sound like a train whistle. Do not stop until you can hear if there is another whistle.
5. **When you hear the whistle, step off the train tracks so you don't get hit.** I can only imagine that getting hit by the ghostly mass would feel like running into a brick wall. Plus, it increases your chances of death.
6. **Listen until you can hear the train no more.** As stated previously, you may also hear additional sounds, and almost all of your senses will be used. Afterwards, there will be an eerie stillness.
7. **Go back to your house.** If you brought your vehicle with you, drive back after turning off your lantern. If not, walk back and do not enter the house until you turn off your source of light. You may or may not still be affected by what you heard, it depends on your levels of thanatophobia (a person who does not fear death will not be affected by it, but a person who does will always be affected by it).
8. **If you want to do the ritual again, remember that the ghost train will remember you.** It will also remember what scares you and what doesn't. And, one day, you'll be one of the passengers to your final destination.

DO NOT LET ITS SIMPLICITY FOOL YOU. There are a lot of dangerous things that could happen. I also wouldn't suggest recording this because, from first-hand experience, your camera could malfunction and delete it the next day. I also wouldn't suggest making contact with any living creature that isn't you, digitally or in person, because they could die if you reach out to them during this, and maybe The Grim Reaper will decide to drive them to Hell (or Tartarus, or whatever dreadful afterlife that your friend believes in) if he feels irritated. You don't want him irritated. If you do anything to offend him, he will get irritated, so be polite and only whistle. Do not take any holy objects with you because some passengers of the train may be going to Heaven, other passengers may be going to Hell, and you shouldn't mess with what afterlife they're going to. Alright, well, with all of that being said, I wish you luck if you try it and try not to die!
