 If you want to understand how the insanity started.

 I tucked my pillow in trying to get comfortable.

 This would be my first time sleeping in my room, I had been staying at my hotel until I could get officially settled in but I decided to jump ahead of the schedule tonight. I didn't know if I could trust this knew entity that was currently living in my home to not taint all of my belongings.

"You're taking up all of the sheets" whispered the two headed spirit monster named Johnny John beside me.

I rolled over "Shut up" I said feeling exhausted and slightly angry.

See after the creature had came out of the portal of my roof I was pissed to say the least.

"Ok, everyone is free to go for the day." I said faking my smile as the anger was bubbling up inside of me. The group of three got up without any questions gathering their random belongings and they were out before Amber could finish saying "Text y'all later." 

I looked over to her, "You can also go, you've served your community service for the day." 

She looked at me and smiled "good, sign my paper work for the day?" I did that for her whilst the two spirits joked about how weird they think I am in the corner.

She left after, walking out with the grace of a quiet assassin.

 I looked back to the two snickering about something.

"Care to explain what this is?" I say pointing to the two headed monster spirit.

"Ouch" said the two headed monster spirit. 

"This is my good friend Johnny John, he's been around for a few years. He said he'd stop by and see the pansy I'm living with, he's a ghost just like me." 

I rolled my eyes, "Ok, why did he bring a suit case." I pointed to the see through suit case sitting next to a few of my jars on the floor.

"Because he's planning to stay for a bit, isn't it obvious?" Laughed the kid, "he sure isn't bright huh?" Said the two headed ghost as if I were the weird one.

I have lost control of my reality, I close my eyes and pinch the top of my forehead. 

I take in a giant gulp of air and breath out.
 "Hey, Amber got to invite over her friends, so I decided to invite over one of mines." 

I felt my eyebrows wrinkle in frustration. "I swear to God kid." 

The teen had a look in his eyes. "I'm not a kid." What? he clearly was one. I gestured to him vaguely.

 "I've been a ghost probably longer than you've been alive" said the teen.

Oh.

Weird.

Then came the night where I kept getting jump scared at every twist and turn.

I walked from my bedroom, boom one of the heads of Johnny John.

I jumped screaming like a maniac.

I opened the door to the bathroom, boom the teen peaking up at me with a smile in the bottom of my hamper.

I noticed and fell backwards screaming.

I had to go down to the basement, boom of course a tickling of my feet from under the stairs.

I jumped from the middle of the staircase landing on my back at the bottom, rampage kicking and screaming.

My house officially sucked in other words.

These two loved being little menaces, and they loved the attention of their target. 

Me.

I heard a snicker from the other side of the room where my chair was. It sounded like the teen, which I guess he had a name now. The two headed monster spirit, Johnny John had called him Jett.

So I'll call him that.

Weird maybe I'll try looking him up in the obituary one day. 

I layed there closing my eyes trying to force sleep to come to me. But my psyche was too filled with questions. 

Then my reality shifted and I felt like I was floating I opened my eyes to see that I was in fact actually floating. 

I let out a "WahTheEHH!"  before I was flung to the wall and right as I was about to make contact with the floor I was floating again. 

This weird weightlessness that was very comforting but also horrifying, a feeling of grace that only birds should have. 

Jett continued laughing like he thought this was the funniest thing he'd done all day, the two headed guy started to laugh too. 

I sighed, Great.

I tried to move but every time I did I felt this invisible restraint around my hands and legs. 

"Hey don't move when I'm floating you." Laughed the teen. 

I rolled my eyes. "Put me down." I said through barred teeth.

He smirked at this, which gave me a shiver. 

He pulled me up still restraining me and floating me, then I felt them.

All swarming over me, millions of little feet and legs, running all over me. I screamed like I was on a fast moving rollercoaster.

I closed my eyes and mouth then I felt them running in my nose again I started trying to blow my nose to get it out of there.

I heard more laughter, before I felt the bugs begin to enter my ears.
It felt like...
A more intense version of a cotton swab but with feet entering them.
 The feeling alone made me open my mouth to scream.

Bad idea..

They immediately infiltrated my mouth all I could do was, spit, blow my nose, and move around wildly, trying to force the damn things off of me. Like what I imagined a chained cheetah would do.

See my brain always gets so hyper focused I forget these aren't real, but they feel real. Ghost spiders if you will. 

Then suddenly it was all gone replaced with cold air, as the two continued their laughing.

I slowly opened my eyes to see nothing, in front of me, just the wall. I was still floating though.

"Please, put me-" 
Before I could finish he tossed me not so gently back onto my bed. I looked over to the teen laying lazily over my couch in the corner. 

Then back to Johnny John laying like that one 'paint me like one of your French girls' memes in my bed. 

I sighed.. I was very unnerved, but frankly I was too tired to care about that right now.

"Guys, I'm alive and human, I seriously need sleep to survive." 

They looked at each other and then back to me. The kid got up and rolled his eyes. "So?" 

"I just need some sleep ok." 

I said exhausted. They both got up and walked outside of my room and they even were nice enough to close the door behind them. 

Finally, alone.
 I lay down more comfortably and finally drifted off to sleep though it may have took an hour or two. 

I kept feeling the haunting reminder of the little feet on me, even though they weren't there.
