The way my feet crept through the heavy piles of snow felt way too exhausting. No buses have been available lately, so I had to get to Alice by foot. A big advertisement sign at the crossroad told me to buy some new shovels, because the snowstorm is predicted to continue for the next 4 months. We have already got about 3 feet of snow in the last one or two weeks and I can't even imagine how bad it's going to get. 

My calves and quads were burning as I continued my way underneath the dim streetlamps, every step had to move pounds of snow out of the way, and I certainly was not fit enough to continue my intended journey as easily as I thought I could. Big clouds were steaming out of my nostrils, dissolving shortly after forming what looked like a round, empty textbox just over the top of my head.

With everything being snowed in, there was a strangely isolated feeling that kept trying to creep its way into my consciousness, but I dismissed it as my primal instincts playing a trick on me. Then, something touched my leg, just underneath the knee. I felt like a limp hand, and I jumped way higher than I should have, which made me fall face-first into the snow in front of me, throwing the white powder everywhere. In its place appeared a burst, wet trash bag, previously covered in snow. How long has that been lying around right there? It must have been at least more than a week, maybe the homeowners went on vacation. 

Lucky them. Getting out of this winterly hellhole is something I could only dream of, instead I still had over half an hour, maybe more, worth of walking ahead of me. After a short breather and with a pounding heart in my chest, my body slowly fought its way onto its feet again and my way continued. The primal instincts were back on, full force this time and an uneasy feeling crawled its way into my brain. 

The beautiful scene with the entirety of the street and its surroundings being covered in snow and colored in the dim shades of the streetlamps and advertisements started to feel less idyllic. My brain started focusing on the unlit parts more and my god, there were many. What was I thinking? There could be something hidden every ten steps or so, why didn't I just stay home? I would be safe there for sure. E

nough, I couldn't allow myself to succumb to these childish fears. Just after trying to laugh at myself, another thing touched me. I felt a warm sensation at the back of my head and in a split second, my comfy, fuzzy hat was gone. I swirled around to take a look at what just took it only to find nothing. The wall, now to my left, was smooth, dipped in a light shade of red. There was nothing on it that I could have stabbed my hat with and there were no footprints other than mine.

 

"Maybe something is following you in your own steps" 

The voice in my head was louder than it should have been. Only then came the realization that I'd never actually worn a hat. 

"I forgot it at home, remember?" 

The more reasonable voice took over my brain now. Yes definitely, but in hindsight, I should have touched the top of my head, since there must have been a small pile of half molten snow on there, if I really forgot it at home. But did it even snow at that time? I can't recall now. Anyway, even if there was someone with me out there, the best I could do was to get moving and reach Alice's flat. 

Disregarding my sore muscles, I sped up my walking speed, trying to find the best balance between pain and speed. As nothing happened for a couple of minutes afterward, my heart started to calm down again and my steps slowed a tiny bit, but I was still on unreasonably high alert and that got me thinking. It's not that late, but I haven't seen anyone ever since I left, which must have been around half an hour at that point. 

There was no way that no one in this big city was making a run to the next convenience store or going home after a late shift. Even better, there weren't even footprints, everything except the imprints of my own shoes was covered in a perfect blanket of the white, heavy cloudpowder. That means that ever since it started snowing, nobody has been going outside. The dim light of the lamps seemed even less warm now. I had to call Alice. 

Surely, she would be able to convince me that I'm just overreacting, because my own tactics did not work anymore. A sad smiley inside of a battery greeted my grumpy face and told me that my battery was gone to the point of not being able to start my phone. Weird, I could have sworn I charged it today. Maybe it's because of the cold temperature. With every new made-up explanation for even the smallest things, they started to lose their credibility and the anxious voice started getting louder again. 

Only twenty minutes to her flat, that wasn't too long. Trying to block both voices, I started humming one of my favorite songs as comfort, since nobody was outside anyway. That helped. I felt more at ease as my own version of "comfort chain" acquainted me through the everlasting sea of snow. My rough throat eventually gave out after what felt like ages and just as some of the tones were rejected by my vocal cords, I noticed something again.  I could still hear something, even though I stopped humming. Was that just my head? No, my ears for sure recognized the tones as real, it even sounded like my humming, just a bit off, deeper. 

I stopped dead in my tracks as shivers started running down my spine, the sound originated from the snow, and I could see waves as movement by something hidden underneath caused the top to shift. Heart pounding again, lungs on full blast, I stood where I was, afraid that if I did anything, something would come out of the snow and get me. Which it eventually did. What felt like a sharp fingernail started caressing my right hamstring, slowly moving up and down before I could even register what was happening. My eyes slowly went downwards, afraid of seeing what was touching me. A human arm covered in bruises reached out from below, dirty rags of frozen cloth hanging down from its elbow. The snow started to move again as I still stood there, paralyzed, watching in horror as more and more of the body became visible. The arm extended and eventually connected to the torso. It was blue. The cold must have killed the skin since it came off in flakes. The head was still submerged, and I did not want to find out what it looked like.  

A raspy sound escaped my throat, I went into full on survival mode, every single nerve impulse transported nothing but the command to flee, which I did. What the fuck just happened? I ran as fast and far as I could until my body gave out and threw me face down again. I wasn't far from the apartment complex and started crawling through the snow, arms digging away in a panicked frenzy until I reached the entrance to the complex. Thank God Alice gave me her emergency key. Still full of fear, I didn't even ring at her door, just stumbled inside after unlocking, hastily turning every single locking mechanism that the door had. 

Only then came the realization. Alice was not home. Every light, except the hallway, was turned off, windows shut, everything tidied up perfectly. After I regained enough battery, I tried calling her, but was greeted by the mailbox. I was sure that we had organized a game night at her place tonight, and she definitely didn't leave either, since there were no footprints outside. 

After looking at our chat, there was no recent conversation about any game night, but I was certain that we made plans. Maybe we actually had a call about it, not a text message conversation?~~​~~ I don't know what's going on. There are real memories of our chat in my head. Why would I so confidently leave my house at this exact time? Then again, why were there no footsteps, why was no one around, not even a single car? 

Maybe I just happened to be the only one out, but that still leaves the missing signs of life unanswered. And what the fuck took my hat, did I even wear a goddamn hat? What exactly touched the back of my thigh? Am I going crazy? No, that can't be. Surely, I just stumbled over a homeless guy that fell victim to hypothermia after being snowed in. But how was he able to move? 

I needed to relax, so I turned on every light and the big TV and threw myself onto the many pillows on the couch, which is where I am right now, typing this. Alice should be inside the complex, probably doing laundry or taking the trash to wherever it goes here. I just have to wait till she comes back. 

Speak of the devil, someone just rang the doorbell, likely Alice. I'll definitely find out what's going on after I let her in, and we finish a bottle of wine or two.
