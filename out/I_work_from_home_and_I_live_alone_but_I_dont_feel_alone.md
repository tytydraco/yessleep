I've been living on my own since 2019, I had a late start on moving out of my parents house. I was 23 years old at the time, and I had only barely scrounged up enough money from working in the food industry for most of my life. I finally found a job that allowed me to utilize my degree, a nice remote IT job. It isn't much, but it pays the rent and it puts the food on the table. A nice house in Texas. It has 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 2 stories, a garage and a backyard. I occupy all of it by myself. And I can comfortably afford it. I don't really like the company of other people, I'm socially awkward and somewhat of a recluse. Occasionally I'll frequent a bar or two. I know what most of you might think, same as what I've honestly been thinking for a while myself, why would a single man move into a house with 2 bedrooms?


To tell you the truth, I don't remember why I did it. I remember my mom crying when I was 5 years old because I ripped a hole in the couch using a kitchen knife. Don't ask, I tried to mimic something I saw in a pirate movie, I think. I remember the first time I got stung by a wasp. I remember the first pet I ever had. I remember the first time I ever got in trouble and my mom yelled at me, she felt so bad about it afterwards she bought me a new game. My memory hasn't ever been so terrible. I could remember the most random thing to the most minute detail, but not the day that I bought this house. Speaking of my mom, we had always been super close, but lately when I try to call or text her, she ignores me. And when I visit for special occasions, she always cries. I imagine that last part has always been because she misses me, but I don't get how someone can miss their child and never return their attempts to reach out. Sorry for getting side tracked, but I do feel these details are important, just so you know the kind of person I am, and maybe so you know I'm not crazy when I tell you all the stuff I'm about to tell you. Well, at least not entirely crazy.


About three weeks ago, I came home from a Friday night out of drinking- I took an uber, I promise for anyone worried about that. I slumped myself on the wooden hand rail and used it to pull myself up, my trembling hands rattling the rail while I fight back the resurgence of every shot I had, mixed with the bars chicken sandwich. I was in a miserable state, but nothing sobered me up quite as fast as the sound of a crying child. I know I was piss drunk, but I couldn't mistake the sound. Not an animal I knew of could make such a sound. How it got in my house was something I hadn't even considered panicking over. I managed to make my way to the top of the stairs, the sound of crying getting louder, with each step feeling like it was falling away from me as I climbed it.


My trembling knees meant nothing thanks to the adrenaline pushing my body further towards the top. The sound was clearly coming from the room adjacent to mine, the white wooden door adorned with a golden doorknob was closed. A light leaked out from underneath the door, more golden and radiant than the knob above it. I began to stumble my way towards it, and now my mind was in a panic- who made their way into my house? Was it a homeless person? I know I locked my doors, but I hadn't checked the back door, not that I ever left that unlocked.


How could someone get in here? And as the door swung open, the once heavenly light and abysmal sound of cries both disappeared in an instant. I had no idea what the hell had just happened. Maybe it was all the alcohol I had in my system. Whatever it was, I didn't have much time to process it, because I immediately ran to the bathroom in the hall to projectile vomit all I had in my system until I was dry heaving. I wasn't able to sleep much that night, my mind was racing a million miles an hour trying to figure out what happened to me. Already dizzy from the nausea, the thoughts only making it worse, I hopped out of bed and sat with my face in the toilet waiting for round two. But that was it. I know most people would think nothing of it, a one off occurrence when you're drunk as shit seems like nothing to most. I'd be right there with you, had it been just a one off occurrence.


The weekend went by without a hitch, I kept all of my doors open, especially the empty room. Occasionally I'd go in there and just pace back and forth, I'd even just peak into the closet to make sure nothing was hidden in there. It wasn't much of a closet, and the room wasn't much of a room either. It was quite small, baby blue walls, carpeted floors and popcorn ceiling. Occasionally my mind would play tricks on me when I'd visit in the night, I swore one time I saw little stars littering the ceiling.


Friday night, a week later, I walked into my home from another night out. The bright light on my porch pierced the surrounding darkness, welcoming me back with arms wide open. This time I wasn't nearly as drunk, I had kept myself on a leash. No crying from the moment I walked into the house and turned on the light gave me a sense of security I hadn't felt since before last Friday. So I made my way to the kitchen, thinking I could maybe make myself something to eat. I didn't eat at the bar that night, maybe because I can't eat the same food I just recently threw up. I'm not much of a cook either I might add, but I can make a damn good grilled cheese. I pulled out a small pan, some bread and cheese- muenster cheese, my absolute favorite. But as I closed the fridge door, I heard a strange noise from the front door. The sound of someone wiggling the handle echoed the empty hallway that got longer with each step I took towards the door guarding whatever was beyond it.


Silence. The rattling stopped, and I felt my mouth go dry, my heart pounding even harder. As I reached my hand out towards the handle I saw it start to turn, and the door began to creep open. I slammed it shut in a hurry, I had no way of protecting myself other than the door acting as my shield. 


"Who are you?! What do you want?!" I shouted with my voice trembling. No response. I quickly locked the door, making certain that even the deadbolt was slid into place and latched down. This time the silence didn't only feel deafening, it felt foreboding. A calm quiet that warned of a storm approaching. And then it happened. The thundering boom of banging on the steel, like that of someone desperately trying to get in. I felt my eyes begin to water and my heart pound to the beat of the fists until they eventually went quiet. My heart being the only pounding that became audible. For a moment, while the air was still, I swore I heard a cry from beyond the door. A woman sobbing, and words of desperation fluttered out from her lips;


"Please... I'm... Alone..."


I stood there, trembling, my mind racing once again to understand. But I knew there was something I had to do, no matter how stupid it was. I approached the door and slowly opened it. The whining of the hinges pierced my ears, but I pushed through it, my fear wouldn't let me open the door any faster. An empty, quiet and dark porch was all that revealed itself. The only light from the street lamp illuminating the empty street. I went back inside, trembling less than before and made my way up the stairs and into my room, but not before peaking into the empty one. Still nothing to see in there, and that's all I needed in order to feel comfortable enough to at least get into my nice, comfortable and safe bed.


I tried to sleep on it, but it was just another night with my mind racing and my eyes stuck open staring at that popcorn ceiling.


I did everything any sane person would do in my situation. Lock all the doors, keep all the lights on, call a priest, do anything to keep myself safe. The priest offered me no help, I've never heard a priest actually get mad before, but when I told him my situation he told me there was nothing to do and immediately hung up on me. Maybe I could go stay at a hotel, but I don't really do well sleeping in other places. For the first few nights I moved into this house, I couldn't sleep for 3 days before my body just gave up. I just let it go, the ghosts or whatever they were hadn't hurt me, they'd only given me a reason to start wearing brown pants around the comfort of my own home. The next day, I paced around the room again, retracing both those nights in my head over and over again. Until I noticed something strange, the room felt smaller. There were also these weird prints in the ground, like some piece of furniture with four legs had been placed in the center of the room. Maybe that was just something from the previous owners, but I had paced back and forth in this room a dozen times every day for the last week, surely I'd have noticed those by now. And then I heard faint sounds of a baby's cooing. I whipped my body around, trying to figure out where the sound had come from, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t figure it out. This was the first time I had heard that sound, but it wasn't my last.


I sat at my computer the following Monday, doing my usual routine of clocking in and then browsing countless social media sites for a few moments until I had heard what sounded like a shower running. The only shower in the house being the one in my room. I threw down my headset and shot up from my chair. The second I started moving towards the bathroom door, I heard… singing. A woman's voice was singing in my shower. Did I get plastered last night and then bring a woman home? I mean I probably would've seen her by now, right? I would've had some sign that she was here before the shower started running. My mind set itself straight and I realized that, obviously, that wasn't an actual human. But at the very least, I needed to be one-hundred-percent certain.


"Hey! Whoever you are, you need to go home! I don't know who you are, but I probably made a really big mistake last night and brought you home, I'm sorry."


The shower was still running, but the singing had stopped. I didn't hear anything, I didn't hear any noise other than the running water.


I decided that I would just draw back the shower curtains, for whatever stupid reason. I'm usually quite respectful towards women, I promise, but I needed to see what was hiding behind my shower curtains. I pulled the curtains back and was greeted with nothing but a ghost using up my water bill. I shut it off and proceeded to walk back to my computer and continue with my boring remote desk job. At this point, I was just fed up with all the stuff happening around me, not even scared by it. So at least that night I was able to sleep better than most, despite the all the weird things going on around me. I was suddenly woken up by someone whispering in my ear. My biggest fear since I was 5 years old was trying to sleep and having a disembodied voice speak into your ear, most nights I'd even sleep with earplugs in because I was just that afraid of it. It was that same woman's voice. Her voice sounded so sweet, but her words were so cold, my hair stood up all over my body.


"To the moon and back."


I turned my head so quick I got whiplash, but she wasn't there. Whoever she was. I wanted to reach out and hold her, I wanted to ask what she meant. To the moon and back? What did that even mean? Why was this woman suddenly haunting me? I tried to remember the voice, the one sobbing behind my door. I was certain that had to have been her. Who was she? Before I could think of anything else, I heard that baby crying again. As I stood up quickly, ignoring the pain shooting through my neck, I heard the shower begin to run and the singing began to follow. I didn't know which to follow, the crying or the singing- and I almost wanted to ignore both of them. I felt my grip on reality loosening until I was saved by my phone ringing, cutting through the sounds of hell that plagued my night. It was an unknown number. I don't usually answer unknown calls, but I felt an obligation to thank even a scammer for helping save me from those sounds. I picked up the phone, put it to to my ear and heard... Nothing. It was quiet. Kind of thankful, I let out a sigh of relief before starting;


"Hello? Who is this?"


A woman's voice. The same as what I've been hearing every single hellish day responded. The tears were evident in her trembling voice as she spoke;


"Don't leave me alone. Please. I'll forgive you."


"What? Leave you alone? Who are you? I don't even know what I did to be forgiven-"


"Don't leave me alone."


"I won't leave you alone. Is that what you want to hear? Now, please, who are you?"


She hung up on me. But she was the one to call me? And what the hell does she mean by "I'll forgive you"? Forgive me for what? Where did any of this come from? I kept repeating her words in my head throughout the night.


The sounds just repeated over and over again, the shower, the singing, the cooing, the crying… But it happens every single day. I've learned to live with it, but it drives me insane. I almost want to sell the house, rid myself of this hell hole, but something I haven't mentioned is that the sounds follow me outside of my house. When I'm driving to the bar I hear the cooing, I hear singing, I hear crying. I don't know if it's just stuck in my head from the countless times I've heard it throughout the last month, but it's plaguing me. I don't think it matters if I leave this house or not.


I'm going to go over to my parents house this week, I need some time with my family to help put my mind at ease for even just a little bit. I will update you all soon if anything changes.
