There are things you only recognize after the fact. Moments that pass by quietly, then years later you realize they were the strange hinge points in your life — places where the world cracked just a little. This was one of those instances. When I was younger, weird things went on. Things I didn’t question because they just happened to me.

Even later, in my professional life, stuff like that kept showing up — not just to me, but around me. People would ask, “What was that about, dude? That was crazy.” And I’d shrug, say I had no idea. Things like that just seemed to happen.

So to start this thing off — the idea of being gifted and talented, or whatever — let’s rewind a bit, to MKUltra. To Uncle Ted.

MKUltra had all these cousins, see. There was Project Bluebird. Project Artichoke. All of them under that same twisted umbrella — ways to see how much you could bend a person before they broke. How much you could influence what someone thought, how they saw the world. LSD, sensory deprivation, electroshock — all that was on the table. Trying to wipe the neural slate clean. See what happens when you strip a mind bare and write something new over it.

They wanted to make people do what they wanted. See the world how they wanted them to see it.

And if you remember Uncle Ted — yeah, that Uncle Ted — he got tagged early. High IQ, off-the-charts intelligence. A young kid, brilliant. He gets into Harvard, or one of those schools — something prestigious. And then this… situation starts.

These professors, handlers really, start “studying” him. Asking about his life philosophy, his habits, what he believes, what he doesn’t. And he’s just a kid. Fifteen, maybe.

At first it’s polite. Academic. Then the screws start turning.

They start twisting his beliefs back on him. “You said this earlier, but now you’re saying that. Doesn’t that contradict? Maybe you’re not as smart as you think.” They dissect him like a frog, except he’s alive, and he thinks it’s friendship.

Imagine being fifteen, thinking you’ve found a mentor — and realizing, too late, that they’ve been sharpening knives the whole time.

They make you doubt yourself. Make you question your own mind. Make you think maybe you’ve been lying to yourself all along. That you’re the fraud.

That kind of thing doesn’t just fade. It rewires you. Twists something permanent inside.

Years later, I’d think back on Uncle Ted — how you take a bright kid, feed him dissonance, confusion, manipulation — and wonder what else could’ve come out of that except rage and solitude. You turn someone dangerous into someone who hides in the woods and builds bombs.

And then, weirdly enough, some of it started to sound familiar. My own story — the way I got pulled into these “gifted” programs.

It started innocent enough. Grade school. Me and a handful of other kids get told we’re “doing fine.” Smarter than average. We get moved to some new class — “to keep us stimulated,” they say.

You sit there thinking, Cool, I guess I’m special.

Then next year, they roll out something new — a “GATE” program. Gifted and Talented Education. You’re getting pulled out of class. Shuttled to different rooms, sometimes different schools. Headphones, listening exercises, strange little tests.

I don’t remember much of it, just this dull weirdness. Questions that felt too adult, too abstract. “Why do you have eyelashes?” one guy asks me. I don’t know. “To protect your eyes,” he says, and I feel stupid. Like I’ve missed something huge.

One of the teachers running it was this woman who looked like she’d just stepped out of Studio 54 — disco clothes, heavy makeup, perfume so strong it filled the room. The kind of woman you recognize later in life at a bar and think, Oh yeah, you’re not going home until Sunday afternoon.

She was mean, too. Sharp. Like she’d been told to play the villain.

We’d do these “field trips” — whale watching, supposedly educational. And she’d say things like, “We’re going to be out at sea, so try not to freak out, okay?” And I’d think — what does that even mean?

At the end of the year, my mom, ever the sweet parent, gives her a present. The woman looks at it and says, “Oh, that’s nice. I was so mean to you this year.”

And I remember thinking — yeah, you were. And now you know you were. So what the hell was that about?

One time, out at PE, she suddenly starts screaming at me — out of nowhere. Pulls me out of class, drags me to another room. I’m a kid, I don’t even know what’s happening. Next thing I know, I’m sitting alone, isolated, “waiting.” I get a five-day suspension and no one will tell me why.

They say we’re having a meeting — my folks, the principal, a school psychologist I’ve never met. It’s me against a teacher’s word. And I’m just this dingbat kid.

The psychologist starts the questioning:
“So, you say you weren’t horsing around in class? You never misbehave? Ever?”

“No, not really.”

He presses. “Never? You never get out of your seat? You never talk out of turn?”

“Well… sometimes.”

And that’s how it starts. Steering. Pushing you into contradictions, forcing you into the narrative they’ve already written. “You do these things, don’t you? You just said you didn’t — but now you say you do.”

Later, in retrospect, I’d recognize the technique. When I started doing interrogations in my own line of work, I realized this was exactly how you guide someone into confessing. You lead them down a road they didn’t even know they were walking.

At the time, though, I just thought — these people are nuts.

Years later, when I joined Special Operations, I saw that same pattern again — the same psychological choreography, different uniform. You think you’re stepping into a James Bond movie: tuxedos, silenced pistols, world-class shooters. You expect glamour. What you get is gray corridors and suspicion.

You show up anonymous, just another trainee. They strip you of everything except your number. Nobody knows who you are. Nobody’s supposed to.

And at first, it feels fine. But the higher up you go, the weirder it gets.

You hit Tier One, and things turn sideways. You’re at a range, shooting like a champ, moving through kill houses, top of your game. Then suddenly the vibe shifts. People you knew go cold. Others whisper, “Who did you piss off, man?”

You don’t know. You never know.

It’s not just hazing. It’s like an invisible hand tilting the table, watching how you react. Testing your limits.

And then — they cut you loose. Just like that.
No explanation, no closure.

Then months later, you run into one of those guys. He’s all smiles, like nothing ever happened. “Hey, man! How you doing?”

And you play along. “Yeah, I’m fine.”

But there’s something in his eyes. Like he wants to say something but can’t. Same thing happens again with another dude — this one even higher up, someone who’d once seemed cool with me. Suddenly he’s looking at me like, Nope, not a fan. Gotta get you out of here.

Years later, I see him again. Walks right up like an old friend. “Hey, man, how are you?”

I’m thrown off. “What? What is this?”

He grins. “I’m great, dude. Great. Just wanted to see how you’re doing.”

It’s weirdly kind, weirdly rehearsed. You realize it’s not about you — it’s about them watching how you respond.

And the whole time, the thought sits in the back of your head: maybe this is the same experiment, just with better funding.

Because that’s what it felt like. All of it. The programs, the training, the setups — they weren’t about results, they were about observation.

Watching what makes you tick.
What shuts you up.
What makes you compliant.

And at some point, you understand the bigger picture: they don’t want people like us — the curious, the stubborn, the ones who ask questions — to be threats.

They want us neutralized. Tamed. Predictable.

So yeah. That’s probably more than enough. But if you’ve ever felt the world watching you sideways — not in a paranoid way, just in that subtle, bureaucratic way — you know what I mean.

Because they’re not always trying to break you. Sometimes they’re just trying to see what it takes to make you stop asking why.
