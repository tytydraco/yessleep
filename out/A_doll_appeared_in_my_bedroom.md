I've always been fascinated by the paranormal, especially by the stories posted on r/nosleep. I've read hundreds of them, from the creepy to the downright terrifying. But I never thought I would experience something like that myself. Until last night.

It was around midnight and I was browsing r/nosleep on my laptop, lying on my bed. I had just finished a particularly scary story about a haunted doll that killed its owner. I was feeling a bit uneasy, so I decided to take a break and watch some YouTube videos to calm my nerves. I closed the laptop and put it on the nightstand next to my bed. Then I reached for the remote control to turn on the TV.

That's when I heard it. A soft, childlike giggle coming from somewhere in my room.

I froze, my hand still clutching the remote. I looked around, trying to locate the source of the sound. It was dark, except for the faint glow of the streetlights outside my window. I couldn't see anything out of the ordinary.

I told myself it was just my imagination, or maybe a sound from the TV downstairs. I tried to ignore it and turned on the TV. I flipped through the channels until I found a comedy show that looked harmless enough. I turned up the volume and settled back into my bed.

But then I heard it again. Another giggle, louder this time. And closer. I felt a chill run down my spine. It sounded like it was coming from under my bed. 

I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight app. I slowly moved to the edge of the bed and peered under it. There was nothing there. Just an empty space with some dust bunnies and a pair of old shoes.

I breathed a sigh of relief and laughed at myself for being so paranoid. It was probably just a prank call or a glitch in the phone line. Or maybe I was still spooked by the story I had read earlier.

I put my phone back on the nightstand and turned off the flashlight. I decided to call it a night and go to sleep. I turned off the TV and pulled the covers over me.

But then I heard it again. A third giggle, this time right next to my ear. 

I felt a cold breath on my neck and a small hand grabbing my shoulder. I screamed and jumped out of the bed, turning on the lights. There, on my pillow, was the most horrifying thing I had ever seen. It was a doll. A raggedy, dirty doll with button eyes and a stitched mouth. It looked like it had been dragged through mud and blood. And it was smiling at me. I recognized it immediately. It was the same doll from the story I had read on r/nosleep. The one that killed its owner. The one that was supposed to be buried in a cemetery miles away from here.How did it get here? How did it find me? What did it want from me? I backed away from the bed, feeling a surge of panic and disbelief. I grabbed my laptop and opened it, hoping to find some explanation or help. But instead of the r/nosleep homepage, I saw a blank screen with a single sentence written in red:

You shouldn't have read my story.
