2017-18, I spent in Singapore at a pretty fancy concept art school (FZD). I wanted to work in the video games industry, and I had gotten some money from my family to make that dream come true. 

The first couple of weeks were pretty exciting because I was on my own for the first time and on the other side of the planet, nonetheless. Left to my own devices, I grouped up with some other students, and together we moved into our apartment for the year. It was a pretty big flat. It had enough room to house four students comfortably, and a giant window front in the living room, which we promptly reorganized into a space for our computers, drawing, and painting. 

We heard from the previous students who rented the apartment before us that the school curriculum and the teachers are extremely strict and demanding. But we had no Idea. We heard that many people who wanted to do the 1-year course, but had to drop out or even went crazy. "Workload and sleep deprivation," some people claimed. 

  
The first term went by slowly. Lots of basics and all traditional. Pen and paper, tedious but necessary. Term two was the one that almost broke me. I was behind on my weekly submissions, and I was sleeping very little at that time. I started hallucinating in class at some point. 

During a class on rendering different materials on sphere shapes, I was pinching my legs to keep my eyes open. It was a real struggle against just passing out in class. The room was dark so that we could see the projector screen. I was looking at it when all of a sudden, a bald man seemingly pushed his face through the screen and tried to break free. The fabric of the projector screen stretched around his head, and he was screaming. Then, a blink and he was gone. I almost fell off my chair.

  
I went home that day pretty worried about my mental health. I had to finish tomorrow's submission today, or they might send me back home, or so I thought. My Slavic roommate got us some Subway on his way home, and we started working right away. Around 5 am, I still wasn´t done, but I had to go to bed to catch up on sleep, at least until 8 am. I felt trapped.

That's when it started. A nightmare. I woke in my room, but the walls were tall and distorted. My blanket was gone, and it's cold. I was looking straight up the impossibly high ceiling, and I could hear something to my left. It was scratching and moving in the walls. The rats were digging their way out. 

That's when I noticed that I couldn´t move. My arms and legs were so incredibly heavy, and every attempt to move was met with immense resistance. The rats were scratching on the back of my head. A silent panic set in. The walls started to collapse and buried me under rubble. 

I woke up again. The room was whole but flooded with red light. I could hear water from the sink running over and hitting the floor. I still can´t move. I looked over to my roommate's bed to ask him for help, but it wasn´t him in his bed. In his stead was a big, hairy creature. Dark, black, messy fur and ît growling at me. I tried to scream, but all that came out of me was a sick hissing escaping my lungs. 

I woke up again, still in my room, but this time there was a light shining in from the outside. Like a car with the foglights on, casting long prison bar-like shadows on the wall from the half-drawn window blinds. I was alone. I tried to call out to my other roommates, but still, only hissing was coming from my throat. Then I noticed him. A dark figure on the edge of my vision. Tall and frightening. Small beads of dim wight light coming from the void where his head would be. There I was, trapped in my own body and unable to move or scream. The man came closer and bent over me. And there he waited. I was so frightened that I couldn´t move even if I wanted to. 

This would repeat about five more times. I would wake up again and again. Waking from one nightmare into the next. And then finally, the day came and saved me from this limbo.

  
That was the first time this happened, but it wouldn´t be the last. I have encountered sleep paralysis many times in my life, and it was always in times of immense stress. But I prioritized my sleep way more after this nightmare, and I managed to finish my one-year education. Sometimes I can still see the man in black from the corners of my eyes. I think he followed me home.
