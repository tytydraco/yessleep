My dad lived in the Appalachia’s during the 80’s and 90’s but he moved out as soon as he was allowed legally. His parents weren't the problem, it was the area that was the problem. He loved the mountains, in his words;  
“The view was like candy for your brain, and the wind was like a kiss from a goddess.”  
My dad never regretted his decision but he did miss the place. He never once told me why he left, he just told me never to go. We had moved as far away as possible, all the way to southern California. My dad died a few years ago, not long after I got a job with a caving company. My job is to explore caves that cause issues for local wildlife and human life. My job often consists of climbing in the cave, exploring, finding the problem, and relaying the information back to the appropriate people. Pretty simple and well paying. I’ve traveled across countries exploring all sorts of caves, in all sorts of cultures, in all sorts of weather.  
When I got the call that I would be heading out to the Appalachian mountains and near the exact point where my father lived, I was understandably excited, I was practically jumping for joy. I couldn’t wait until we arrived. It took some time and a few flights but I made it to eastern Kentucky. We had to drive all the way up through the mountains but I wasn’t complaining, it was just like how my dad described it and so much more. The view is like candy, the wind like a heavenly kiss, the grass, like rolling butter, and the mountains, like natural testaments to nature's beauty. We arrived at an old looking cabin built on stilts, place looked to be a million years old. I recognized nonetheless, it was in fact my dads childhood home. Was almost a direct recreation of the pictures he showed me.  
The team told me that they needed to set up the equipment and to just hang out for half an hour while they set it up. I told them that I was going to be inside the cabin. They just nodded their heads and waved me away as they started to unpack their equipment. I stepped inside to still see all the furniture inside. Everything was coated in a thick layer of dust, so much so, that I could barely make out the original color of everything. I walked around the small house and reminisced on all the stories my dad told me about in this house. I spent my time looking in every room. As I was about to walk out of the cabin my manager walked in.  
“Hey, I need to tell you about what's going on in this area,” he said, looking around the room with his hands in his pockets.  
As he said this I felt the ground grow and immediately fall back to its original place. After this happened the back of the house crumbled and brought down half the house. My manager and I ran outside of the house as it fell.  
“That's what I was going to tell you about, there are some strange seismic reading out here, now it’s not weird for mountains and mountainous areas to have a few earthquakes every now and then, but these are getting to be more and more frequent and they aren’t just regular earthquake either, you felt it.” He said all this and he was obviously frightened.  
“Don't worry man, I’ll figure out what's going on and if I don’t then I think that you will” I reassured him and started getting my gear on.  
I came to the cave entrance, it was a large open cave entrance, one of the biggest cave entrances I’d ever seen. I walked in with all my equipment set up to standard, I wouldn’t normally do this but this was serious, I had to be as well. I came to my first problem a few dozen yards from the entrance, a vertical drop. I did my usual and hooked my rope to a rock and made very sure that it was secure. I was climbing down when another earthquake happened. I could feel wind being pulled into the cave then, hot air came barreling out of the cave. Not only that but the cave walls also expanded and contracted just like the mountain itself. When I made it to the bottom, it leveled out and I started exploring further in, only to find the cave split into five different directions. I planted a piton onto a crack in the wall and hooked my spare rope to it before continuing down the center path.  
I came to a large open room with a pool of liquid in the middle, I felt the walls around me start to shake and crumble a little. Another earthquake was about to happen. I threw a stone in the liquid only to watch it hit the liquid and immediately disappear. The sound of steam escaping the rock didn’t give me faith in the liquid so I decided that it would be best to leave it be. Just then another earthquake came but I felt no wind. I followed the rope out then marked the center path with spray paint. Then headed down the path to the right of the center and very quickly came across a split is the path again. As I sat there doing eenie-meenie-minie-moe, my manager came across the radio strapped to my chest.  
“David, David do you hear me?” he sounded frantic and I could hear the team packing up a bunch of equipment.  
“Yeah man, I hear you, what the hell is going on up there?” I asked as fear rose in my chest  
“These earthquakes aren’t geological, they are biological” I don't even remember the rest of what he said but that's when it took another breath.  
I ran, I ran as fast as I had ever run in my entire life, that is as fast as I will ever run ever again. I grabbed the rope and didn’t bother to hook myself to it, I just started climbing. It coughed, I felt the breeze come in, then the forceful winds followed it, then it made a sound like a cat hacking up a fur ball. Its throat started to close around me and I was thrust out of the beast but not before smacking against the roof of its mouth. I landed on the outside and broke both of my legs before continuing to roll down the hill. My manager caught me and lifted me onto his shoulder with the help of another one of my team. They carried me up the hill as the beast continued to cough that loud roar of a cough. We made it to the top of the hill and loaded me into the truck as the driver sped off.  
My manager called anyone that would listen and soon enough we were all paid a large sum of money to keep quiet. Apparently it was waking up from some long rest. As far as I know, they put it back to sleep but I'm not heading back there to figure it out. The money means nothing to me, my broken legs have a story to tell and I’ll be damned to hell if I don’t warn someone of the dangers in Appalachia. My dad had the right choice, move as far as possible. I did, and you should as well because if that thing wakes up then let God have mercy on your soul.
