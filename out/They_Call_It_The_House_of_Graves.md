Part One

My house was new to me, old by any other aspect. Where we moved to, old equaled cheap, and as a former self-emancipated teen and current broke adult, cheap was almost too much to afford.  
  
I’m grateful that my friends helped me with the move. When I’d left my parents’ house for the last time, I took nothing but what could fit in a bag, the clothes on my back, and the money I’d earned through back breaking work at the factory my father had worked for over thirty years. The old man would’ve noticed if I’d taken anything more and being discreet was the only reason I got out of there without getting pummeled all over my scrawny body. Or worse. But maybe nothing is worse than the desert town called Halliton.

Far away from any family, far away from most things, was Halliton. It was a Southward drive shy of an hour down into Santa Fe, where my new community college classes were, but far enough to feel alone in the world. The place, despite being so rural, felt like a literal oasis at the end of those absurdly long stretches of roads we took there in our cars, loaded up with stuff. I didn’t have much, never had. My friends – Rebecca, Martin, and Raul – agreed to help me take my stuff from my shitty old apartment and into Raul’s truck.

Before we moved, the four of us sat around my last apartment, eating Chinese food and watching some movie, when Raul said something we all resonated with, “We need to get out of fucking Oklahoma.”

That was all it took.

The houses around Harrow Hill road were spaced far apart, as it was with these older places. I’d been in a few towns like this when I lived in Oklahoma, usually near or in the woods. By the time we arrived on our property, it was after 10pm. The house loomed over us, feeling taller, larger in the dark. The windows were blacker than the night sky, and from even outside you could hear the occasional creaking and groaning of the house settling, like an old widow, perched on her hill, moving through the pains of time going by too fast around her. 

A two bedroom with a finished attic was somehow cheaper than anything else on the market, and I’d eventually understand why.

“Warner,” Rebecca called for me at the top of the stairs within the first five minutes we started bringing boxes in. “You’re sure you’re all right with the loft? I mean, I know it makes sense for Martin and I to take it, but the thought of going up and down the stairs to check on the baby on the way, not to mention morning sickness. And it doesn’t have a lot of space to put your paint and easel…”

“I’m okay with putting all that in the basement.” I told her matter-of-factly.

“It’s not even finished.” She insisted.

“Well, would you rather me get oil paint all over carpet, tile, or hardwood floor?”

Her mouth drifted open as she considered it. “Guess you gotta point.”

“Rare, I know.”

“That’s, like, super cool of you, by the way. To give us the master bedroom.”

“Well, you are two, almost three people occupying one space. You'll probably want your own bathroom. Hard to argue with the math.”

It took three, maybe four hours to get all our stuff inside the house, and by the time we got our mattresses in our respective rooms, none of us felt like unpacking anything beyond some pillows and blankets to make it through the night. We put together our cash and “nose go’d” that Martin would be the designated pickup of pizza and beer. He gave Becca a peck on the lips before heading out into the harsh winter cold with that ugly gray scarf of his.

Rebecca and Martin had been practically married for about ten years, but as high school sweethearts who had recently turned 20 (Martin) and 21 (Rebecca) they were only married on paper for about two. I met them in grade school, and we were recess friends. You know, usually the kind of kid from another class, another grade, or someone you just never talked to in your own class for some reason. We reconnected together while working an old job at a restaurant.

“I think Monica’s into me,” Raul got himself a glass of water from the kitchen. He must have had the forethought to put some utensils and stuff in place at some point. “I know it’s long distance, but I think we can make it work. I’ll make enough at this new job to pay for flights back and forth.”

Raul I met in high school. He popped a guy in the gut at a concert for some metalcore Linkin Park ripoff band for breaking my nose after I bumped into his beer hand. Nothing bound two guys together as brothers more than escorting the other over their shoulder to the hospital three blocks away. We couldn’t have learned more about one another that night than if we got piss-pantsing drunk in a parking lot past 11am, one of few pastimes in our old Midwest town.

“And you assume this because…?” Becks arched a brow as he went back for more glasses for the two of us.

“She kept rubbing my shoulder when we clocked in together in the office, and I’d caught her checking my pecs once or twice before my last day before going remote.”

“Totally a litmus test for any successful relationship.”

“Feh. Monica’s not one for *relationships*, and I think I’m okay with that. After Daisy cheated on me I’m kind of over searching for love. I just want to have fun.”

It was so obvious that Rebecca didn’t agree with that mindset. Neither of us expected she might. I’d been single my whole life at that point, not even a wishy-washy middle school girlfriend. I mean, I’d once gotten one of those rubber bracelets from a girl in my calc class, which gave me the butterflies, but seconds later got told she’d apparently smoked a joint before fifth period and was making them for everyone. Thus were the breaks in one’s teen years.

It didn’t matter to me, though. I was too busy keeping my nose to the grindstone while working on a degree in engineering and soon looking for a job. Last month, before moving, I was working at a family restaurant with Mart and Becca, which was kinda nice, but also not sustainable. I kept falling behind on job duties due to all-nighters studying and trying to maintain at least some hobbies. Like painting.

I wasn’t sure if I was particularly good. Friends praised me, but I’ve never bothered to submit a portfolio or attend art fairs. Painting was exclusively for me. A skill and pastime all my own that no one could take away. It’s nice to have things like that, to have one thing that makes you feel whole. I still like painting despite all that’s happened.

Martin returned with food and and a six pack like a knight showing up to save the day, and with an empty belly I particularly felt like a damsel in distress. Men could be damsels too, given the right circumstances. Rebecca, of course, had sparkling water instead. Three beautiful, greasy slices and two cheap beers later, and I was more than ready for bed. Martin and Rebecca were too, but in a different sort of way.

“Keep the boinking sounds to a minimum when Warner and I are home, you spouses.” Raul stood up from the floor with a groan and a symphony of cracking from his back. Our sounds would be the same once we stood. “I’m going to crash so hard, glad I don’t start work until Monday.”

“Me, too.” Martin and Rebecca agreed.

I wasn’t so lucky, but I was used to going to class and working in all conditions at the community college I just transferred credits from. I had qualified for a partial scholarship at my new college, but the usual academic fuckery messed with getting me full grants for some reason, so I still owed half the tuition myself. I planned to spend all of tomorrow in Halliton looking for something that worked with my day classes.

I flopped onto my classes, dreading the early morning of registering for Santa Fe Community College and all the tedious paperwork that would follow.

…

I found work pretty easily at the Gas n’ Get, the gas station convenience store near the edge of town. It was perfect, the overnight shift let me get to my classes in Santa Fe and back home in time to rest up before heading into work. Only my first shift in, and I knew pretty much the ins and outs. My boss, Frank, was laidback and the register was relatively automated for such a rural town.

That weekend, we had our first welcome at our house's front door. He was an older guy, I’d say fifties or sixties, judging by his graying roots and salt and pepper beard. His puffer vest over a long sleeve flannel and worn hunter’s canvas pants combo was sort of ageless in its own way, so it was hard to nail down what range of age he was. I grinned politely at him, more of a lips pulling back into an awkward line sort of expression. Pure Midwest behavior.

“Hi, the name’s Daniel Spritcher. So, you’re the new neighbors. I met Mr. Perez before, but not you.” He meant Raul. He offered his hand, and I shook it. “I’m your landlord.”

He laughed as though it were obvious, but as Raul was the one who found the place and did most of the paperwork, the most the three of us had to do was sign the lease. Raul had plenty of flexibility to do all that as he worked virtually and had the free time to get us set up. He’d found our house for cheap, and the rest worked itself out from there.

“Oh! Wow. Uh. Thanks for the intro,” I said awkwardly. “I’m Warner, by the way. Are you just stopping by to say hello, or is there something I can help you with?”

“The wife and I live down the road, ‘bout a couple football fields distance that way,” he pointed eastward. “So you’re welcome to stop by for a cold one if we’re out back on a weekend night. Just built a new firepit for the backyard. Make helluva smores.”

“That’s a kind offer, sir.”

“We saw you moving in, Wanda and I, and, thing is…” The old man scratched his neck, already raw from other scratches. I tried not to stare. “Young people, moving somewhere like this, we wonder if…I know you won’t volunteer the truth when I ask this if it’s true, but are you four in some kind of trouble? Running from someone? The law?”

“Oh, God no.” I balked and waved my hands quickly. “No, uh, we’re just looking for a fresh start.”

“Not the first I’ve heard of something like that, but almost never for our town. Guess I should have suspected that when I listed the house online after the last ones rented. Thought I’d try to keep up with the times. Listen, this is driving me crazy. Sorry, if this is awkward, but the more we talk…” More scratching, a little more aggressive. “I recognize you, somehow. You ever been around here before?”

“No, sir." I was taken a bit aback by the question. "First time here.”

“Right, right. I remember Raul mentioning that. Never lived nearby? I used to substitute at a high school in Pecos.”

“No, we’ve all lived in the west edge of Oklahoma our whole lives. I worked the graveyard shift at the Gas n’ Get last night, first day, maybe you saw me there?” Though I thought I would have recognized him if that were the case, there was no accounting for memory issues.

“Strange. Graveyard shift, you said? No, I was most surely in bed by that time. Well, nice meeting you. Offer still stands for free beer and good company, maybe pizza from Andretti's on Wren Street – you *are* old enough to drink, right?” He asked quickly.

“For a couple years,” I laughed.

“Good, know you guys like beer. A six pack and pizza always hits the spot.”

I furrowed my brow a little at that, amused how accurate he was about move-in night. Were twenty-somethings easy to clock as still having their college tastes?  
  
"Well, be seeing ya."

He nodded and left, pulling the collar of his vest up to his ears as the winds blew sharper with the coming night.

…

Weeks went by, and I was well into the groove of working the graveyard shift. I left there to go to my only class that morning, and I finally returned home around 11am.

Have you ever had the feeling of knowing someone is home, even if you’re on your own in another room and everything's quiet? I wondered if that was tied to the human animal’s sense of surviving predators in prehistoric times. The knowing one's being watched. Some leftover primal instinct embedded in our DNA.

The only car parked around the house was my own. Unlikely anyone but me was home. I tried to shake it, but I ended up sleeping on the sofa. New place jitters. I hadn’t lived in a house in about five years, and assumed it was the size, the emptiness, that got to me.

I dicked around on my phone for a few before putting on some podcast to fall asleep to. I’m the kind of person that can’t sleep without noise. As I was falling asleep, I heard someone loudly moving overhead, but was too close to dreaming to wake up.  
  
Then someone *was* home, but how? Did one of the three walk home? Did Martin drop off Rebecca, or the reverse? Whoever it was went down the stairs, then back up, then down again, then back up. They were clearly searching through everything, there was so much thumping that I was sure they’d retrieved something huge from their room. Outrageously loud. I sat up and was rightfully annoyed.

“Who the fuck is up there?” I called loud enough to reach upstairs.

No answer.  I figured it was Raul. I’d seen him leave earlier with his backpack. And I'd recognized the smell of his outrageously expensive cologne. As Raul’s remote in coding, he preferred to work at libraries and coffee shops for ambient noise. The only options he’d have in this town were a small library, a few coffee shops, a diner, or a couple little bar restaurants that seemed reserved for nicer meals out. Ermaline’s, where Becca and Martin had just been happily brought onto staff with.

I was about to come up the stairs when Raul came down, in a major hurry.

“Hey, man –” He brushed past me, cutting me off.

He made a sort of grunt in replacement of a real greeting or answer, and went out the door with a slam. In hindsight, despite going upstairs he had nothing in his hands. All that heavy thumping and dragging, things falling, and nothing to show for it? For that matter, why had he come home? *How* had he come home? Did he really walk back? Park down the road for some reason?

Despite these questions, I didn’t bother to check if he had driven in or what. If he’d taken even a minute to talk to me, I might have offered him a ride back into town. I went back to the couch, fuming at how rudely I’d been awoken. Despite my rage, I somehow fell asleep.

I woke to the sound of Mart and Becks coming home, laughing and taking off their coats. They, at least, had the decency to look ashamed when they’d realized they’d woken me up.

“Hey, guys.” I rubbed my tired eyes.

“Hey, bud, get enough sleep?” Martin was always concerned about my irregular sleep patterns, a real health nut.

“About six hours. I only had one class today.” I stretched and stood up. Only 5 o’clock, and it was already pitch black outside, but that wasn’t surprising for winter. “How was work?”

“Monotony.” Martin answered bluntly. "Can't wait to rent a spot to open a practice."

Martin had formal training in holistic chiropracting. A little pretentious, but at least he was helpful, not pushy about supplements and whatever.

“But we’re meeting a lot of people! Great tips when it’s the biggest restaurant in town.” Rebecca said happily. “Speaking of! We brought home baked ziti for dinner. Hungry?”

Of course I was. We were near finished with the meal when Raul came home, and I remembered the cold shoulder he’d left with after he rampaged upstairs. When he came into the dining room, I put my fork down a little more forcefully than I should have. This caught his attention.

“Hey,” I looked up at him with annoyance, and he was taken aback. “What was up with this afternoon? All that, and you wouldn’t say two words to me? Are you angry at me or something?”

He furrowed his brow. “What are you on about? This afternoon?”

“You went upstairs, you started moving things around, dropping things. Woke me up with it and left after grunting at me like some douchebag.”

“Whoa,” Martin spoke up, hand up in a gesture for me to pull back. “Warn, you got it all wrong.”

“Really? Seemed pretty clear to me.”

“Bud,” Raul kept looking at me as if I were a stranger. “I never came back home today.”

That didn’t compute in my brain. “Dude, there’s no way, I *saw* you.”

“Well,” Rebecca spoke up. “I mean, it’s true, War. He was at the restaurant all day.”

I struggled to piece that together with the reality I’d experienced. It was absolutely Raul. I’d seen him, smelled his cologne in the air, he’d brushed against my shoulder as he’d left. But, I mean, I was asleep when he’d supposedly come home. It was *possible* I’d dreamt it, but still.

“Look, have you been upstairs?” Raul offered.

“No…” I hesitated. “I went back to sleep.”

“Well, if I was doing what you said, it would probably be a mess, somewhere. Let’s go upstairs and check it out.”

I followed him up the stairs. First, to the right, the hall bathroom. Nothing, everything in order. Then the master bedroom. Everything was intact, but frankly it didn’t seem Raul’s style to tear up someone else’s space. Next was his room. Same as last night when we’d played Xbox together, everything but his blankets were in their usual place.

“See?” Raul said with finality. “Now will you drop it? You’re weirding me out, man.”

“I…” I rubbed the back of my neck, confusion making my head spin. “Yeah. I mean, yeah. I’m sorry. I guess it was just a dream, or something.”

“Sleepwalking,” Martin offered. “Your sleep hygiene has been all over the place. Maybe you’re still adjusting to the new sleep schedule.”

“Right, yeah. But, just to be sure, let’s check my room?”

“Hold on, you’d think I’d fuck with your stuff? As, what, a prank?”

I was already up the stairs by the time he’d asked. My heart thudded in my chest, not just from the sprint upward.

“Whoa,” Raul joined, and Martin came up the stairs to peer around him. “Wait, hold the fuck on, I *did not* do this!”

My room was trashed. My bedding was all rumpled, half on the floor, pillows scattered around. My drawers were rifled through, clothes tossed haphazardly in the direction of the door, even my curtain rod was pulled from the window.

“Raul!” I was livid, I started getting to work cleaning, beginning with the curtain rod, but I was so frustrated I ended up fumbling with it and just threw it to the floor. “Why the fuck would you do this?”

“I swear I didn’t!” He had his hands over his chest, eyes wide and wild. “I was gone all day, dude!”

Martin put himself between me and Raul with clear intention to diffuse the coming fight between us. Truly a future dad skill coming into play, stopping a childish fight.

“Stop. Obviously *someone* came inside the house. Or…I mean, it’s possible that you might have been asleep but still moving, Warner…” The silence filled in the blanks on his thought process.

“No way, I was not sleep walking! I – I woke up in the same position I fell asleep in! My phone in my hand, earbuds plugged into the charge port.”

“If someone did come in, why was the door unlocked?” Rebecca asked from the bottom of the stairs.

“They probably used the key under the mat,” Raul ran his hand over his face. “We’ll need to find a new spot for it, it’s the most obvious place anyone could hide one. I just didn’t think it would be an issue in a town like this. Should we report it?”

“There wouldn’t be much they can do…” Martin thought a moment as I stuffed things back into the drawers. “I’ll go into town tomorrow and get one of those video doorbells. It doesn’t fix much tonight, but it might make us feel safer. We’ll bring the spare key inside, make sure the doors and windows are locked, and make it work 'til morning.”

“Oh my God,” Rebecca started freaking out downstairs. “I can’t believe this is happening. We *just* moved here.”

“No one took anything,” I answered with finality. “My watches, my silver chain, my gaming stuff. It’s all here. Maybe I was sleepwalking. Or…I dunno. Something happened. Martin’s right. We’ll get a camera. Could’ve been some idiot punk kids. I’ll talk to the landlord.”

“You’ve met him?” Raul asked as Martin went downstairs to comfort his wife.

“Yeah, the other day. Seems like a nice guy. Lives down the road about five minute’s walk away, he said.”

“Wouldn’t hurt to bring it up.” Raul stress sighed. “Warner, I’m sorry. This really sucks. I’d never do this to you, man.”

“It’s fine,” I ran a hand through my hair. “Let’s just make sure everything is locked. You guys get some sleep while I’m at work.”

“Tell Barb I say hi,” Martin chuckled. The stories I’d told about my favorite regular could fill a book, and I’d only been working at Gas ‘n Get for about a month.

…



That night, the gas station shift was going by like normal. I actually liked the overnight shift. It paid hella well for what it was, and I was sort of enjoying the zen of stocking shelves with nothing but the sound of humming refrigerators and the occasional trucker making a snack or piss run before heading out on the road. I’d probably like being a truck driver, if it weren’t for the fact I was determined to get that degree.

Cohan, a regular who showed up around two AM most nights in his eighteen wheeler, and always bought out the Corn Nuts from their peg. I hated those things, but he said they went well with his smokes, of which he bought two packs of as well. Who was I to hate on someone’s road snacks? He was a big guy, the quiet type. He was the kind of guy who concealed carried but in a comforting way, the sort to put you behind him before he pulled the trigger.

I was busying myself refilling the Corn Nuts that Cohan had bought out when Barb came in. Sometimes I wondered if she sat out in the parking lot to wait for the store to be empty.

“Hey, hey, Warner.” She greeted in that gravelly country accent of hers.

“Evening, Barb. How’s the weather on the roads like?” Being a notch up into the mountains, a winter night here could sometimes drop down to the cold of a Midwest winter day, still bitter and cutting.

“If I had any balls they’d be puckered up and fallen off frozen,” she answered. “Trucks don’t hold no heat, even the newfangled ones. Looked at the forecast and read my cards, clear skies all the way through the weekend. Not like we’ve really had snow around here in years.”

I wanted her to be right, and usually she was. She and her Tarot cards were more accurate about things past, present, and future than any hackneyed psychic could ever be.

Honestly, Barb was just flat out cool. She sported a jet black bob hairstyle (which I frankly thought was a wig) that contrasted starkly against her pale skin. Her clothes and accessories were straight out of a hippie stoner’s dream wardrobe. Crystals hung on hemp and rope around her neck, dreamcatcher earrings dangled from the sides of her head, and rings of all kinds of stones adorned nearly every finger. She was a time capsule of the 70s.

Old enough to be my grandma, but her arms were scattered with tattoos. God, I wanted her to *be* my grandma.

Despite being just about five foot tall, she was able to knock back enough Red Bull in a night to put me to shame. She’d pulled a few flavors by the time I met her at the register. Those, plus a packet of snack cakes were her usual purchase of choice. We kept up our typical kind of conversation, until she said something that struck me.

“You smell all kinds of wrong.”

I cringed. Guess I should have showered before I’d come in, and the smell of sweat lingered on me as if I’d just come in from the rain. Then I squinted.

“Wrong?” It was such an odd way to phrase someone’s bodily smell. “How do you mean?”

“Strange,” she added, with absolutely no clarification. “Something new happened.” It wasn’t a question, which unnerved me.

“Uh,” my tongue flicked over my lower lip in thought. “I don’t really know, everything is the same as it has been for a while. School, home, work. Rinse and repeat.”

“Today. Something happened today.”

I laughed, used to her eccentricities. She’d recently offered me a genuine rabbit's foot to pass an assignment, which I borrowed (in a plastic baggie), and passed, but that was based purely on how much work I’d put into studying. When I’d returned it, she rubbed salt over it and put it back into its original cloth satchel.

Realization killed my laughter, though.

“I guess. Yeah, something happened.”

I told her about earlier that day. How I’d been asleep and ended up feeling like I was going crazy so soon after I’d woken up. I’d tried to put it behind me all night while working, focusing my energy on the moment instead of my mind. I was pretty good at that. I knew a lot of people had a problem with clearing out thoughts to meditate, but I never really had that problem. If anything, the whole head emptying thing was almost a problem of its own.

“You ever sleepwalked before?”

I shook my head. “Not to my knowledge.”

“Mmmm…” The sound was grainy coming from behind her closed, thin lips. “That’s bad news. Doubt it’s sleepwalking. Could’ve been, of course, but ain't very likely if you never experienced it before. Mind if I read my cards?”

“You keep them on you all the time?” I arched a brow as she pulled them from her purse.

“They work good when they soak up my vibrations.” 

Okay. Made total sense. I think.

She pulled a cigarette from her bag and held it between her lips as she rifled for her Tarot deck. By the time she pulled them out, her pink lipstick smudged up half the cigarette and smeared a little onto the skin around her mouth.

“There we go. Let me shuffle 'em.”

She set the box down on the counter and started maneuvering the cards as smoothly as a dealer at a casino. In a way, Tarot card reading kind of felt like gambling; hoping for a good hand, wanting the results to be just the pull you’d need to fulfill your desires. She had me pull three from a handful of ten, took them back, and laid them out face up. The only one I could recognize was The Tower, the other two were sort of faded, probably from years of use.

Barb gnawed gently on the butt of her cigarette.

“Upside down,” she tapped The Tower with the back of her knuckle. “Something’s off. Obstacles, bit o' misfortune in the air, coming hard times. This one,” she tapped on another, “Five of swords. Means someone’s working to get ahead by any means necessary. Foul motives. Lastly. The Hanged Man.”

“That one sounds kind of not great,” I grit my teeth.

“It means sacrifice, dying to oneself and one’s needs for a necessary change. Misfortune, misdeed, martyrdom. The intention for this reading was for revelation, now it’s time for interpretation. Want to try first? Often, the one read to can have more insight than the deck dealer.”

I considered it a moment. This was Barb’s best ability, that she could convince even a stout skeptic for even one minute to consider her mysticism as possible. I never considered myself a skeptic or believer, but Barb was closest to pulling me to one side over the other.

“Foul motives, I have no clue about. Obstacles, difficulty, maybe balancing both work and school?”

“A bit shallow.” Barb muttered, and I felt judged, which egged me on to try again.

“What happened today…” I ventured. “Might happen again. Or be the first of something. I should ask Mr. Spritcher about it tomorrow.”

“Spritcher?” Barb echoed. “Why him?”

“He’s our landlord.”

“Oh, God.” Barb closed her eyes, the butt of the unlit cigarette now squished between her teeth. “I should have put two and two to make four. There’s just so many houses up for rent as the youngers move out for big cities. It’s that house on Harrow Hill?”

“Uh, yeah?”

“I guess it figures he wouldn’t have said anything, that weasel Spritcher. He bought up that property six, seven years ago and has been renting it out ever since.”

“Sounds kind of standard?”

“No one sticks around there for long. Even before that idiot bought it, it had a reputation. Kid, if you talk to almost anyone in town over the age of fifty, they could tell you all about that place. Its history. What we know of it, at least.”

“Its history?”

“Anyone who’s lived there ends up leaving. Whether because they pass in the house, someone else passes away inside, or they just…disappear. Warner, it’s a house that has its own name and it’s earned it for good reason.”

My throat was stuck, thick, gluey. “And that name is?”

“They call it The House of Graves.”

I lay awake that morning, no classes. Thinking, thinking, thinking. I thought about Mr. Spritcher. About Barb. The house. God, the house. And Raul, what happened last afternoon.

I couldn't blame Spritcher for not divulging the track record of the tenancy. Who would want to live in a place that couldn't hold onto a renter under those questionable, and alarming, circumstances? And Barb, what she told me about the house itself, her insane accuracy on all things metaphysical. And Raul. I ran that interaction, that bizarre moment, the inexplicable outcome, all over and over in my head.

I curled up onto my side, face in my hands as I tried to think. Any detail, any extra scrap, a thread of remembrance to pull things together and make it all make sense.

Then, it struck me.

Through the veil of sleep, either the sleep of that afternoon, or the one that overtook me in the moment, I saw it. Clear as someone standing before me. Clear as a voice right in my ear. Unmistakable as if someone called my name. Somehow, it had blotted from my mind, smeared away from the canvas of my memory like oil paint with a painter's palette knife.

It *was* Raul.

But he didn't have a face.
