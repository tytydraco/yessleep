The salty air whipped through my hair as I lifted myself onto the bridge's railing. While gazing mindlessly into the rapid waves below, I rose to my feet and teetered slightly over the edge. 

My clenched fists trembled and dripped with blood I had anxiously drawn from my palms. I inhaled a gulp of air, savoring the pleasant feeling of full lungs while it lasted. 

I refused to look down, opting to clamp my eyes shut in order to avoid the sinking feeling that came with it. I had always been afraid of heights. 

The trembling in my legs began to intensify, making it nearly impossible for me to mantain my balance. I decided now was the time, opening my eyes just enough to gaze into the warm pink sky as I let my body relax and fall forward. 

My limbs flailed frantically as my feet neared the water. It was too late to regret it, but I did anyway. I understood now that I never wanted to die, I just wanted my anguish to halt. But what if the stillness I've been yearning for is emptier than the life I've been running from?

The ice cold water engulfed my body, and to my surprise I felt not pain, but tranquility. Realizing that there was no way to turn back now, I simply accepted my fate. One last time, I closed my eyes and prayed that wherever I was headed was better than here. 

And when I awake days later in a hospital bed, that prayer still lingered in my mind as if only seconds had passed. I sat up, a debilitating pain striking my gut and eliciting a loud groan from my lips. 

My jaw clenched tightly as I clutched my stomach, desperately attempting to soothe the agony which now began to spread throughout my entire body. 

I surveyed the bland room around me in search of a call button, a desperate attempt to inform the doctors of my crippling pain. Though, it was only a matter of seconds before my worries shifted from my physical pain, and my eyes started to well with tears as I recalled how I got myself in this situation in the first place. 

I had barely any time to process my sorrow before it was replaced by fury. I knew my chances of surviving that attempt were practically zero, which led me to believe that someone must have somehow saved me. 

I remembered the regret that washed over me in my final seconds, yet the thought of a stranger going out of their way to preserve my life still made me sick with rage. I shakily forced myself onto my feet, and without thinking rationally, I tore the IV out of the flesh of my forearm. 

The sound of my blood dripping onto the marble floor was audible as I reached to slide open the curtain. I stepped out into the narrow hallway and was instantaneously struck by the unpleasant scent of iron and must, forcing me to swallow a string of gags that threatened to spill. 

Slowly, I began to descend down the seemingly endless stretch of walls, only able to hope I was headed in the right direction. I wasn't quite sure why, but with every step I took, uncertainty mixed with the rage pumping through my veins. 

I quickly determined that the only logical explanation for my sudden anxiety was the eerie silence that engulfed me. I was in the hospital a lot when I was younger, and I vividly recall the place bustling with people-even during the late hours of the night. I found it odd that this place seemed empty. 

Finally, I reached the end of the hallway and was greeted by two sets of stairs. One led down, and one went up. I determined by the labels that I was currently standing on floor two, and so I chose to go down in order to hopefully reach the lobby. 

I felt nauseous as I reached the final step, finding myself gazing into a colossal room decorated with high-end furniture and costly paintings. This was like no hospital I'd ever seen before, and was a shocking contrast to the bland floor I had came from. 

Though, the size and quality of the room wasn't what scared me. It was the lack of people. I swallowed dryly as I spotted the man across from me, sitting stiffly behind a tall wooden desk. 

He wore a white balaclava which covered his entire face, the only exception being two small holes for the eyes. It was just us, staring at eachother blankly before the silence became to much to bare. 

"Um, hi." I said, my voice unintentionally escaping as a whisper. 

"Hello, Jade." He replied huskily. 

I furrowed my eyebrows in confusion, taking a subtle step backwards. "How do you know my name?"

The legs of his chair scraped against the tiled floor as he slid backwards and rose to his feet. I gasped as he revealed the rifle slung over his chest, his gloved finger hovering impatiently over the trigger. 

"My knowledge is none of your concern. You must focus and listen to me carefully," He began. 

My muscles tensed as he pointed the gun at me, and I reflexively nodded. 

"If you desire another chance at living, follow my instructions. You have a limit of five minutes to find a way to kill me before this room fills with gas."

His blunt instructions stunned me to silence, and I found myself paralyzed by shock and fear as I asked myself the vital question; do I want another chance?

I was well aware of the fact that I had nothing waiting for me back at home, yet I couldn't shake the glimmer of faith as I thought of a second chance at life. 

"Your five minutes starts now," He stated. 

I stumbled backwards, nearly tripping over my own two feet as I frantically raced up the stairs. While I navigated the lengthy halls, I wondered how he expected me to find a way to kill him in a place meant for saving people. 

Obviously, this place wasn't a real hospital. I didn't know what it was, nor did I have the time to wonder. All I knew was that suddenly, I found a will to survive. 

I barged through the first door I came across and began swiftly raiding the room, tossing supplies and machines all over the place. 

The room was filled with things such as pills, stethoscopes, and useless tools that seemed to hold no purpose. 

"Fuck!" I shouted, sprinting out of that room and into the next one. I repeated this process over and over again, growing more desperate by the second. 

"Two minutes remaining," A robotic voice echoed over the speakers. 

I briskly slid back into the hallway, my heartbeat echoing through my ears as I headed for a stray cart. I nervously bit my lip as I stared at the cup of syringes atop of it, my hand hovering shakily over them. 

I thought back to the anesthesia I'd seen in the medicine room, and I smiled quietly to myself as the realization dawned that if I injected him with just enough of the substance, it'd knock him out quickly without killing him. That way, I wouldn't have to live with the guilt on my consciousness. 

"One minute and thirty seconds remaining." 

I retraced my steps back into the first room I entered, moving carefully as I stuck the syringe into the vial labeled Anesthesia and flooded the chamber. 

A firey tingle in the back of my throat caused me to fall into a uncontrollable fit of coughing. I turned around and looked into the smoke filled hallway, placing my arm over my mouth. 

My body, reacting on pure survival instinct and surging adrenaline, cut through the cloud of gas and descended toward the staircase. 

If in that moment I had stopped and thought for just a single second, I am almost certain I would've chosen to inject myself with the syringe instead. But for some underlying reason, an unfamiliar determination had sparked within me and embraced my emotional compass. 

A wave of simmering electricity pulsed through my legs as my sneakers found the lobby's ornamental floors. Time slowed to a drag, my eyes finding the terrorized gaze of the masked man who sat just a few feet away. 

Upon reaching his desk I allowed my muscles to relax completely, my knees buckling in order to conceal my figure behind the object. 

"30 seconds remaining."

Reluctantly, I stuck the syringe between my teeth, careful not to put too much pressure on the fragile glass. With newfound access to both of my hands, I slipped my fingers beneath the bottom of the desk and focused all of the strength I could muster on my upper body. 

I flipped the desk, effectively pinning the slender man beneath the wood. 

"10 seconds remaining." 

With the syringe in my right hand and the man's wrists in my left, I forcefully injected the needle into the flesh of his forearm. He let out a raspy cry of pain, his body tensing in retaliation to the abrupt attack. 

"The game has concluded. Congratulations, Jade Fuchs, you may proceed to the next round."

"Ne-- next round?" I felt light-headed, a familiarly bitter taste coating my tongue as if I was going to throw up right there.
