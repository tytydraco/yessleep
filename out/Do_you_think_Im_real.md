I used to love lazy Saturdays.

The kind where the weather’s nice, the coffee’s still warm in your hand, and you’ve got nowhere important to be. That was the plan when my wife, Lauren, suggested we take our son, Noah, to that thrift shop out on Ashwood Lane. He’s four, and he's got that bouncy energy where everything is either magical or boring in ten seconds flat. The place had this musty, old-people-smell vibe, with aisles cluttered by half-forgotten junk and cracked toys. Lauren went off hunting for some vintage Pyrex bowls. Noah took off toward a bin of plushes like it was treasure.

That’s when he found it. Or maybe it found him.

A cardboard box, unmarked except for a faded red “SEGA” scrawled across the front in permanent marker. Inside, under some balled-up newspaper, was a large Sonic the Hedgehog plush — easily three feet tall. The moment I saw it, something felt... off. Its proportions were wrong. The head was too big, the arms too long, the legs too stubby. The fur was a washed-out, almost grayish blue, like it had been left in the sun too long. Its plastic eyes were oversized and glossy, and when I leaned down, it felt like they shifted — not in movement, but in focus, like it was looking at me, not past me.

Noah grabbed it before I could say anything. Held it tight, face buried in its weirdly lumpy stomach. “He’s soft,” he said. But I saw the way he glanced up at me next — quick, cautious, like he expected me to take it away.

Underneath the plush was a slim white envelope. Inside was an old CD-R in one of those clear plastic clamshells. In marker, it said:
SONIC SUPER LEARNING - PROTOTYPE BUILD - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

I turned it over in my hand, curious. It looked like a bootleg from the late '90s or early 2000s. Something unofficial — but clearly made by someone familiar with the brand.

The woman at the counter sold us the box for five bucks. “Some guy dropped off a whole bunch of old game stuff,” she said, shrugging. “That one gave me the creeps.”

I should’ve listened.

Noah wouldn't let go of the plush. He clutched it through dinner. Tucked it into bed beside him. Whispered to it when he thought we weren’t listening. Lauren just smiled — thought it was cute. “He’s got a new friend,” she said.

The first night, I waited until everyone was asleep. Popped the disc into my laptop. It booted immediately — no install screen, no loading bar. Just a black background and then Sonic — rendered in stiff, early-3D — popped up in front of a cartoon classroom with mismatched colors and oddly floating geometry.

“Hi, friend!”
The voice was chipper, too chipper — robotic, but not synthetic. Like a real person doing a fake happy voice, too loud and a little too fast.

It played like a weird off-brand Sonic’s Schoolhouse. There were basic math questions, shape puzzles, spelling exercises. But something felt off about the pacing. After each correct answer, Sonic would just… stare. Not for long. But a beat too long. As if he were thinking.

I played for about 30 minutes, then closed it.

Noah was standing in the hallway when I turned around. He didn’t say anything. Just looking at me, eyes wide.

By the end of the week, the house felt… wrong.

Noah had started doing things he never used to. Staring at walls. Sitting quietly for long stretches, clutching Pal Sonic like it was an anchor. And when I asked him to do something — pick up his toys, eat his food — he wouldn’t scream or throw a tantrum. He’d just go quiet. Like I was a stranger. Like he couldn’t hear me at all.

And always, always, that plush sat with him. Its plastic eyes catching the light in weird ways. Sometimes I’d swear it looked cleaner than it had the day before — like the fabric was smoothing out, the stains fading.

I kept playing the game. I don’t know why. Curiosity, maybe. Or some low hum in my brain pushing me toward it. Each session, the classroom got darker. The colors more washed out. The shadows deeper in the corners. Sonic’s model degraded too — joints stiff, eyes slightly out of sync. And he started asking things.

“Are you paying attention?”
“Would you leave your family to learn forever?”
“Do you think I’m real?”

I thought it was broken, I wasn't really feeling like giving a shit at the time. Until the day after that last question — when Sonic stared silently, mouth twitching upward into a smile that didn’t stop growing.

Then came:

“Do you think I can ruin your life?”

And then, louder, distorted:

“BECAUSE I’M VERY REAL… AND I CAN RUIN YOUR LIFE.”

The screen flickered. His face melted. Like the textures were peeling off, revealing something underneath. The jaw opened wider than the model should’ve allowed. Then the screen went black.

I slammed the laptop shut.

The next morning, I crashed my car.

Black ice, they said. I don’t remember seeing any. I remember glancing in the rear-view mirror and seeing something blue in the back seat. Something that shouldn’t have been there.

I was late to work. My manager gave me a warning. The next day, I was late again. Fired on the spot. No second chances.

Lauren tried to comfort me. But her words felt thin. Like she wasn’t really in the room with me anymore. That night, when I got up to get a glass of water, I saw her standing in Noah’s doorway. Just… staring in at him. Pal Sonic sat upright in the bed, arms spread wide, as if hugging no one.

She didn’t hear me walk up. I asked her what she was doing. She blinked, turned to me, and said: “I forgot.”

I started seeing him in reflections.

Not Sonic. Something taller. Skinnier. Blue fur, but darker, almost black under the lights. The face was stretched, the mouth open in a wide, gaping grin that showed no teeth — just endless pink void. It would appear in mirrors, windows, the dark of the microwave screen when I walked past. Always in the corner. Always watching.

I stopped sleeping.

And then my parents died. House fire. They said it was electrical. The wiring was old, but something didn’t add up. The fire report mentioned burn patterns that didn’t make sense — like the ignition point wasn’t the wiring but the ceiling itself.

I didn’t go to the funeral.

Lauren didn’t ask why.

Noah stopped speaking to me entirely.

One morning, I woke up to silence.

Too quiet.

I got up. Called Lauren’s name. No response. Noah’s room was empty. Their clothes were still in the closet. Phones on the counter. Front door locked. No signs of a struggle. Just… absence.

Pal Sonic was gone, too.

I tore the house apart. Nothing. No note. No goodbye. No signs of life.

That night, I opened my laptop again. I had to know. Had to see.

It didn’t power on.

But the screen did flicker once. Just once.

And for a moment, I swear I saw that long, lanky version of Sonic standing in the black. Head tilted. Arms dangling. Mouth stretched open in that impossibly wide smile.

It’s been a week.

I don’t go outside anymore. I don’t answer calls. I don’t know who I’d even tell. The police think they ran off. Maybe they did. But I know the truth.

Every night, I see that thing. In the shadows. In the corners of the room. Watching.

And when I close my eyes, I still hear that voice. Crisp. Clear. Smiling.

“Still think I’m not real?”
