“Are you really *that* afraid of the basement?” My boyfriend was busy putting on his blue buttoned shirt as he asked me casually. I glared back at him. “You’re seriously going to bring this up now? I’m busy getting ready for brunch” I said grumpily, pulling on my bra. He shrugged apologetically, “Look, I’m sorry okay. I just want to know why. Especially if it’s such a big issue. We can talk about it whenever you want. But I would really like to talk about it eventually.” His tone was calm and filled with sincere concern. 


I sighed. I felt my annoyance slip. I had been avoiding this subject for so long. I really didn’t want to bring up my past but Timothy had been so great. We’d been living together for over a year now and he’d been very patient with me and my phobia of dark places. I don’t just mean I’m afraid of the dark, I mean I go into full on panic attack mode and start tearing the walls apart with my bare hands and finger nails and teeth if it gets even close to dark in any room I’m in. It makes going out at night or doing anything normal like going to the cinema, or planetarium or club or bar very difficult. I have a nightlight in every room in my apartment and also plenty of backups plus flashlights, candles, lighters, a pound of fresh batteries of all sizes. Of course, my smartphone can also function as a flashlight. I could go on. But suffice to say I am surrounded by light as much as possible. 


This was also why we were meeting Tim’s parents for brunch in broad daylight and not dinner. Never dinner. I didn’t leave the house once it got too close to sunset. I mostly drive where ever I need to go. Taking public transport is too risky. And I don’t travel very much or very far. I also cannot enter a bathroom that has no natural light and nothing but motion-sensor based lights. If they go out for just a second my heart races, my blood boils from fear and my lungs burn from panic. I scream and run, crying usually until I’m back in the light. I was very lucky to have Timothy around. Unlike my previous boyfriends he never made snide remarks about my phobia, even when it disrupted his schedule. His effortless patience was a stark contrast to my previous relationships; I had never seen him so much as raise his voice.


I slowly sat on the edge of our bed “Okay Tim, I’ll tell you why. Right now actually if you’d like. I’d rather just spit it out. We have a few minutes and it’s not a very long story anyway”. Timothy quickly pulled on his last sock and came over to sit next to me. I looked at him and then looked back down at the bed. “I’ve – I’ve never told this to anyone. But the reason I’m so afraid of the dark. Of being alone. Is because of what happened to me in the basement when I was ten years old.” I paused and Tim took my hand. His fingers were rough and warm. “I’d never had issues with the dark or the basement or anything like that ever before. One day my mom asked me to go down and fetch the laundry from the dryer. So, I’ve been down in the basement of this house a billion times and I think nothing of this at all. The door creaked loudly just like normal as I opened it. I lazily walked down the steps and was busy messing around with my new Walkman when I suddenly heard the door slam behind me. I yelped and was plunged into darkness so pure I thought I’d gone blind. 


I groped in the darkness for the light-switch. I heard it click as the lightbulb buzzed to life noisily,” as I spoke I could feel my heart beat begin to accelerate. I could picture that basement now. That bare light bulb. My hands shook. Tim noticed this and began to caress my hand comfortingly. I continued, “The basement wasn’t that big or fancy.  Nothing but bare concrete. We used it to store some old furniture and photo albums. Of course, we kept our laundry down there too. I was a bit spooked by the door slamming, so I decided to get the chore over with fast. However, as my foot left the last step and touched the cold concrete floor the - the lightbulb glowed. It glowed so brightly and it burst. I screamed from fright as I was plunged into darkness again. It was also so quiet, the distant sound of my parents or brother now extinguished. All  I could hear was my own breathing,” I paused again to catch my breath. It had been a long time since I’d told this story. All the memories that came with it filled me with terror. 


“I had. I mean. I - I moved in the direction of the laundry. I waved my hands in front of my face but could see nothing. I knew that there was a flashlight in the drawer of the desk next to the dryer. I took a few tentative steps expecting any minute to feel bright pain explode through my hip as I bumped into the desk. But I never did. So, I started taking bigger steps. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I realized that something was horribly wrong. I should’ve been on the other side of the room by then. A few steps after that I should’ve been on the other side of the wall!Before I knew it I was running. No, I was sprinting! Hoping to be lucky enough to slam hard into the wall. To prove this nightmare a fake.  But the wall never came. I ran through cold darkness. 


Then I heard a voice.  A soft whisper. It was the voice of a man. There was nothing abnormal about his voice at all. But it gave me goosebumps. He – he warned me never to return to the dark. He warned me never to tell anyone.” My lips trembled. But I continued, my voice shaky, “By then I was beyond fear and incredulity. How could this be possible? Where was I? I yelped and shielded my eyes because it was suddenly blindingly bright and I felt really cramped like the room had just shrunk. Then strong hands were grabbing me and lifting me and I found myself being pulled from a well.” Tim’s eyebrows shot up into his hairline at this point but he remained quiet. “We still have no idea how, but some men had heard a noise and once they’d seen me they rescued me immediately. They found me in a well that was hundreds of miles from my house. From that damn basement.” 


I paused again, rubbing my temples with the tips of my trembling fingers, “I had to go to therapy and no one could ever explain anything. Like I said before, I never mentioned what really happened to anyone. I didn’t know whether I was more afraid of people thinking I was crazy or if I was really more afraid of that – voice. All I said was that I blacked out on my way down the stairs. The therapists said I may have gone into a fugue sate or something which basically means they don’t have a God damn clue what the hell happened to me. I continued to go to therapy for years and years. But it never helped. I felt I could never tell anyone the truth. 


Anyway, it all ended up in the papers and my family and I had to move to a whole new town. After that it was just kind of swept under the rug and people stopped asking questions. My parents never bring it up. They pretend it didn’t happen. I like to do that too. So now that I’ve told you I don’t want to hear another word about it. And if you tease me or prank me, so help me God I’ll dump your ass.” I was trying to make a joke to help break the tension but I could feel myself shaking more and more as I recounted the story. It had been some time since I’d thought about that traumatizing day. I felt tears form in the corners of my eyes but quickly blinked them away. 


Tim sat silently and still, his expression one of sympathy and concern, “Wow, I had no idea. That sounds really horrifying my dear. I completely understand your fears now. I’m feeling a bit less fond of the dark too.” He kissed me lightly on the forehead and rubbed my arm.  I looked up at him with disbelief. “You – you don’t think I’m crazy? You - you believe me?”


He smiled warmly, “Of course I do. I can totally believe this universe is full of strange, unexplainable sometimes horrifying stuff” He paused and looked into my eyes, “But are you still okay for brunch with my folks? We can always reschedule and get McDonald’s or something. Watch some *Ducktales*?” I smiled at him and chuckled. “That’s tempting but no. No, we’ve booked a table and everything. Besides it’s too short notice now to cancel. Let’s get going soon. I feel okay. It was a long time ago.” Tim glanced at me in a way that showed he was wholly unconvinced, but he yielded. “Okay my dear, I’ll just take the trash down quickly. Meet you downstairs.”


A few minutes later I had my makeup on and was waiting downstairs on the ground floor. Tim had left ahead of me to take the trash to the refuse bins in the basement and I had expected him to be waiting for me already. But he wasn’t there. I frowned, confused. Is he still downstairs? Why is he taking so long? I tried to keep my panic in check but as the minutes ticked by my heart began to thump loudly. “No, no, no. There’s no such thing as the dark-place. There’s no such thing as the monster in the basement.” I stammered to myself softly as I tried to force the panic back down into the recesses of my stomach. “He’s just -  he’s -” I couldn’t end that thought. What if by telling him the truth I had put him in danger? The voice had said not to tell anyone. I thought that it would only be angry at me. But now I’m starting to think otherwise.


My blood was electrified with terror as I took a small step toward the stairs. The stairway was curved so that the door was hidden. I craned my neck and peered around the corner. The large, metal basement door was shut. “Tim? Tim, is everything ok?” My voice shook slightly as I spoke but it was firm and loud. Silence pressed against my ears. I pulled my phone out of my bag. With the tap of a button a small but bright flashlight switched on and illuminated the hallway.  I turned the flashlight toward the stairs.


With shaky hands I took a step forward and started to descend. I halted after three steps. I felt dizzy now. “Tim? Tim this isn’t funny. I’m really freakin – “, then I heard him. “Cara! Cara!  I tripped and hit my head”. I heard him groan in pain, “I think I twisted my ankle. I really need some help.” My fear instantly dissipated. Tim was hurt badly! His voice sounded really worried. If he’d been unconscious this whole time he’d need serious medical attention. Shit! Why had I waited so long to check on him? Of course, there’s no such thing as monsters. I hurried down the stairs and grabbed the door handle heavily as I pulled it open. 


Complete, utter darkness pressed up against my eyes and I felt an unnatural coldness in the air. The basement door swung back and slammed into me so hard I felt myself fly through the air. I hit the ground hard and yelled with pain and surprise. The impact knocked my phone from hand and I heard it smash as its light went out. “What the hell?” I stammered, my head swimming with confusion. “Tim? Timothy!” I whimpered in the pure darkness. I was sitting on the hard, damp floor which was the only other thing I could sense besides the horrendous cold, my soft sobs and the musty smell. Then a gloomy light bloomed to life. 


My jaw dropped open in horror. 


It couldn’t be possible. 


There, many yards in front of me, too far to be possible, a single bare lightbulb was hanging. Its light was cold and small. It looked almost exactly like the light from my old basement. As I looked down I yelled and began to wail loudly. Lying in the pool of light beneath the bulb was the mutilated, bloodied corpse of my dear, sweet Timothy. The man who I had loved more than anything. The man I had wanted to marry. The man who always made me feel safe. The man who knew exactly how I liked my coffee and pancakes. His grey eyes were empty as they stared at me. Gone was that perennial warmth and love. His body was covered in deep scratches and blood soaked his clothes.


Oh my God! He was dead! Guilt, terror and pain of all kinds washed over me. Tears poured down my face and I yelled incomprehensibly, pleading for someone to help. Without warning, another identical lightbulb appeared before the first. My whimpering paused.


Then another. And another. My eyes widened with terror.


Soon, hundreds of lights were blooming into existence like frigid, miniature stars. The line of lights made a beeline towards me with the final bulb flickering to life above my head. I heard the sizzle and hum of its electromagnetic field. I was frozen from fear. I had no idea what to do. 


My eyes burned with tears and I squinted. Suddenly there was a loud *pop*. A bulb had exploded and I shouted from fright. I gazed down the line of lights and gasped. At first all I saw were the shards of broken glass and the remnants of the broken bulb above. It had been the bulb right at the far end. My gaze shifted. A humanoid silhouette stood beneath the broken bulb. My heart stopped dead. “No, no, no no no no” I moaned softly, my brain unable to process my terror.


Then the next bulb in the line burst and the man instantaneously stood beneath it. One light closer to me.  I screamed from fear and found myself clambering to my feet. I had to get out of here!


As I struggled to stand in my panic, I heard another loud *pop* as the next bulb blew. Then the next exploded. Suddenly all the bulbs were exploding one after the other louder and louder. I saw the silhouette get closer and closer, as swift as a shadow. “No! Stay the hell away from me!” I screamed as bile forced its way into my mouth. My heart screamed from panic. As I turned I heard a soft, raspy voice say, “We warned you”. 


With tears flooding my face I groped wildly for the basement door. I could feel someone standing right behind me! I yelled with delighted surprise as my hand grasped the door handle. I heaved the door open and ran screaming up the stairs and out of the building. I continued to run and scream as I welcomed the feel of warm sticky Summer air on my skin. I’d never been so happy to see the calm blue sky and the vicious midday sun. 


I ended up being taken to a hospital by a bunch of cops who’d seen me yelling and crying as I ran down the street. My face and clothes were covered in dirt and my knees and elbows were scratched but otherwise I was unharmed. I did not dare tell them the truth. Instead I said I’d had a panic attack triggered by going down into the basement to find Timothy. 


The police searched the entire building but the only thing they found in the basement that proved Timothy had been there at all was the trash bag he’d taken down. At this time the police have no leads. I miss Tim so much. I feel a numbness where he should be. I keep expecting him to be just around the next corner. His parents refuse to answer my calls. On the other hand, my parents won’t stop calling.


Suffice to say I cannot even think about the dark without bursting into tears. Even if there was hope for psychological recovery, I don’t think it matters. I still feel like someone is standing behind me constantly. The feeling is especially strong when my back faces a lightless room. 


I’m never alone now. They are always watching me. Waiting for me to return to the dark. I’ve kept all the lights on constantly and have not left my apartment in days. But no matter how long I wait I can still feel them. I’m not even surprised. After all, I had not heeded the dark’s warning. I get the feeling those who trespass are never forgotten and, certainly, never forgiven.
