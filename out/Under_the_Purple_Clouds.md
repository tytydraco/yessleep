Under purple clouds, I died.
I can't say I led a hard life. Busy, yes, but not hard. Working full-time at Books n' Brews while studying wasn't easy. I had little time to myself between the two, and those moments were typically devoted to rest. 

"Lily!" My best friend from high school sashayed into my work. Fighting a groan, I plastered a smile on my face.
"Hi, Sasha. The usual?" 

Flapping her hand in consent, she leaned on the counter.

"Guess what?" Sasha grinned, crinkling the freckles spread across her nose and dipping a dimple in one cheek. 

"Davie Small is hosting a party!"

I fought the groan that wanted to surface. Davie Small. Who continued calling themselves Davie after growing up? But that suited Davie; he was fast nearing thirty and still hosting parties that young adults barely out of high school enjoyed, and according to rumors some attendees weren’t even that old.

"... and?" I placed her latte on the counter, rolling my eyes.

"Uhhh, we're going, of course?" She took the cup, sipping her drink, and looked at me like I was insane. I turned to wipe down the latte machine.

"I'm not going. Need to study." 

"Oh, come on! It's a Friday night! You have the whole weekend!" I glanced behind me as the doorbell jingled. Sasha leaned on the counter, her fingers bent in plea. Mrs. Peters cleared her throat, sparing me from further conversation. Sasha sighed heavily as she moved to allow the older woman to move forward. Mrs. Peters ordered her Americano, followed by several other customers, giving Sasha no opening to begin trying to coerce me into going to the party. 

Unfortunately, the reprieve was relatively short-lived. After an hour, my shift was over, and Sasha was still there when I came out from the breakroom with my backpack swung over my shoulder. She sat in one of the chairs with her arms crossed and her firey hair opposing her cold glare. She hated it when I said no to her. 

"Why don't you want to have fun with me anymore?" She pouted. I watched as her eyes shifted from the frosty glare to begging. Wondering why I'd never noticed how manipulative she could be, I considered my words.

"I really must study and don't want to hang out at Davie's. Sasha, you have to admit he's kind of creepy," I said, glancing behind me as I held the door.

I thought I saw something flash in her eyes, but then she rolled them, relaxing her posture as she sauntered past me. 

"You don't have to talk to him at all. I just want to party with you. I never see you anymore." Whining and grabbing my hand, she forced me to look at her. I fought the urge to retort that it was her choice.

"Puhhhhleeeeeasssseeee. You can leave at 10 o'clock, I promise."

"Sasha... why don't we just go to a movie tomorrow or something? I really am not interested in hanging out at Davie's house."

She pursed her lips in irritation. 

"Fine. Don't hang out with me. But don't expect me to be there when you need me."

She turned on her heel and left before I could say another word.

Sighing, I looked at the blue sky. Part of me hoped Sasha would turn around and apologize, agreeing to go to the movies and just hang out together. A more significant part of me had reached acceptance. We'd been growing apart for almost two years, and I didn’t think that would change. I wanted to finish my AA and go to a large state school or perhaps out of state if I could get a scholarship, get out of the small town where we lived, and never return. 

Sasha was perfectly content with small-town living and had decided she would settle down with her boyfriend of a year, Trent. He was the former high school quarterback and assisted at his father’s car dealership. She decided almost two years ago she was destined to be a wife and mother and would be happy with her lot here. It didn't matter to her that we were a three-stoplight town or that "date night" was to a popular chain restaurant that served pasta and bread sticks. It didn’t matter that we’d had our plans. Everything changed the day after graduation, and I wondered if those changes were permanent. 

Whatever. I wanted out anyway, and realistically, I only had three months left in my degree before I'd finish my AA and start searching for a four-year university while taking a semester off to build up my money. It was better this way; I hoped Sasha would be able to accept my moving on. 
Sighing, I walked to my car and tossed my backpack in the back seat. Slipping behind the driver's seat, I started it and was relieved when it turned over. At 15 years old and boasting an odometer that had stopped counting around 200,000 miles, it was always a good day when the sedan started without complaint. I pulled from my space onto Main Street and began the drive to my parent’s farmhouse outside of town. The shops had already given way to fields when the engine started to sputter and cough. 

Pulling the car to the side of the road, I felt it when the vehicle dipped into the ditch. Grey smoke began to rise from the hood as I turned the engine off. 
“Incredible luck,” I said to no one in particular. 

Well, it wasn’t like it was going anywhere anyway. Digging out my phone from my pocket, I jabbed the number for the town’s tow company and garage.
 
Joyce Leonard answered. She was the phone director for the used car lot, tow, and garage. Technically, they were two companies, with the used lot being one and the tow garage the other. Low clientele meant it made sense to share an employee to ease inventory transfer and partner for repair to sell and such. 

Joyce, not one to waste time on a call and no doubt anxious to get back to whatever spicy romance she was enjoying, had the tow booked in less than two minutes and informed me the truck would make it to me in under an hour. She told me to call back if I needed anything else before a brief goodbye, and she hung up. 

Well, I had nothing to do for a while. I opened my back door and dug out my textbook from the floor. Sitting in the front with the door open, I started to read. I’d moved from reading to transitioning my notes into a flashcard app when a beep shook me from my focus.

As the truck pulled up, the sun had moved much lower in the sky than I’d thought, and I couldn’t discern the driver until he stepped from the cab. 
“Well, if it isn’t Lil’ Lily Lyle,” his smarmy grin set my teeth on edge. 
“Davis.” The grin faltered. If he could use a nickname I hated, I could use the name he refused to use.

“Aw, come on, Lils. Don’t be like that. I’m tryin’ to help you out after all.” He drawled as he stood in front of me, all six feet of him looming over my 5’3. I dug in my heels and stretched to full height, glaring back at him.

“Make you a deal. You call me Lily, and I call you Davie.”

He looked at me skeptically before shrugging. “Whatever, Liiileeee.” 
He drew out my name, but at least he said it correctly, so I let it go. 

“Well, what do you need me to do?” Changing the subject, I looked at my car again.

He sighed, hooked my car up to the truck, returned to the cab, and directed me when to turn my wheel. Finally, my car popped free of the ditch, and the truck stopped. I opened my door and stepped out. After checking that I had my phone in my pocket, I turned and found Davie holding open the passenger door. 

Walking up, I nod at him, “Thank you.”

“Ah, it’s all good. Just want you to be comfortable, Lily.” The way he said it made my skin crawl, but I shook it off. The guy had always been smarmy, but he was harmless. At least, I thought so.

“Want some water?” He pulled out two bottles from his dashboard, opened them both, and took a swig from his as he offered the other.

Irritated that he didn’t even wait for my assent before opening the bottle, I considered refusing, but my mouth was parched. I looked at the clock on the dashboard and realized I’d been waiting for an hour and a half. Cursing my luck and the fact that my mom would no doubt be home before me, I typed out a quick text to her explaining the car troubles. Finally, succumbing to my body's needs, I took a sip from my bottle and began to read the app version of my textbook.

“Aren’t ya gonna talk to me at all, Lily? I heard you didn’t want to show up at my party. We went to school together for a bit. We should be able to talk to each other, right? 

Davie had been held back as long as they could allow him to be, and when we graduated, he was six years older than me. 

“I didn’t want to skip your party, Davie. I just really have to study.” I tried to placate him; my small-town southern upbringing and my mother’s fixation on politeness combined in a perfect storm of expectation.

“Ah, forgive me for sayin’ so, but you and I both know that’s BS. You were always the smartest kid in school, and I don’t think that’s changed any.” 

This was not an uncommon sentiment. Sasha said the same thing all the time. But my success wasn’t an instant thing. It was the result of continuous work. Sasha often sat with me in the library at school, studying and working alongside me. We both wanted to go to university, leave town, and were permanently attached at the hip. The day after we graduated, though, Sasha’s older brother Marcus made the three-hour drive back from his university to celebrate. When he was only two blocks from home, someone texting while driving ran a stop sign and crashed into his motorbike. He was thrown and died instantly. After Marcus’s death Sasha pulled back from everyone even me, which I understood at the time. I brought over food and tried to offer comfort, but overall, she seemed subdued, and while she was never rude, she still wasn’t trying to reach out to me after almost a year. The whole friendship felt one-sided. Suddenly, everything seemed to turn around. She was actively reaching out to all the friends she used to have and started going out and having fun, and then the fun never stopped. The girl who would rather read than party and wore sweatpants more often than makeup was replaced with someone I didn’t recognize. From always studious to suddenly vapid was a jarring transition for me, and after a year, I still wasn’t used to it. She seemed to have more in common with the man beside me, who she always called ridiculous than me. 

“Oh, forget it. I’m sorry. If you don’t want to party, you just don’t.” He shook his head. 

“Ya know, it’s weird. I’d hoped you’d loosen up with Sasha. But you’re stubborn. That’s fine; maybe you’ll want to hang out with us someday.”
A wave of exhaustion passed over me. All the late nights, work, and the time spent sitting in the sun waiting for him all crashed over me at once.

I nodded and leaned back in my chair. 

I must have passed out because the sunset bloomed across the sky when I awoke. It was unlike any I’d seen before. The clouds and sky were a lovely lavender color tinged with darker violet as twilight moved in. I didn’t feel alarmed at first; I was just confused. Music was blaring off to my right, and I tried to sit up and look around, my mind whirling and confused.
When I tried to move, I found myself restrained to a large, flat rock, and my brain quickly sobered.

“No point in fighting,” Davie said quietly off to my left, and I wondered why I could hear him so clearly over the heavy music. 

“You’ll understand after it happens. All your worries will fade. Everything will be so easy after you receive the gift.”

“Yeah, right, Davis.”

“Now, now, Lils, we had a deal. But don’t worry. You’ll get it soon.” 

He smiled, and suddenly, lightning lit the sky behind him. For just a moment, he didn’t look anything like Davie. His face was warped and inhuman. But then it was gone, and if I had never been. Honestly, I might’ve been able to fool myself if everything had ended there and he had let me go. But that’s not what happened.

“Yeah, hun, I can’t wait to enjoy hanging out again.” A lilting voice came from behind me. A pain lurched in my chest.

Sasha moved into view. 

She smiled.

“Once you experience the transformation, you’ll completely understand. Besides, it will only hurt for a minute.” 

She brandished an ornately styled knife made of metal corded around itself in arks. The blade itself twisted like a corkscrew. 

“It’s time!” Davie barked. His voice wasn’t quiet, but it seemed to echo and boom impossibly. 

The music shut off abruptly. A crowd of about ten people I recognized from around town began to circle me. Davie came up to one side, Sasha on the other. 
Davie began to speak in a guttural language that I couldn’t understand. He raised the knife high over my middle, and then he plunged it down, twisting my guts in the process as he went. The knife burned, and the burning spread from my core right out to my fingertips. It felt as though my very soul was burning. Then it was gone, and so was I, falling into nothingness. 
Under the purple clouds, I died. I think.

I say I think I died because the next day I woke up—in my bed. There was no evidence anything even happened. Not on me anyway. There are other… things, though. I no longer need to sleep more than three hours a night. I only want meat for food. Anything else smells like garbage. Not just any meat, either. I can only eat it raw, and I prefer beef. I don’t need to eat as often either—only once or twice a week. I remember everything, still feeling like ‘me’ but also… not. I’m still going to class. I still study just as much, which is easy when I don’t need to sleep. My mind has also changed. It’s like I can absorb information by osmosis. I read something once, and there are no more misunderstandings or need for actual study. No more flashcard apps. Just the textbook and listening. Speaking of listening, I can hear things clearly in a way I never could. All my senses are turned up to eleven. 

Then there are the others. Instinct demands I blend in with them. I go to parties, hang out, and go shopping with Sasha. I’ve even met up with Davie a few times for drinks, each time putting on a peppy mask to make them think I’m okay with everything. So far, to my knowledge, they haven’t brought in any more acolytes, as Davie calls us. The Change hasn’t been so bad for me, as things go, but people should have a choice in these matters, and I’m still resentful that I didn’t. I’ve never told them that; I act like I’m like them for now, at least. There is a part of me that is not “me.” Not anymore. Or maybe It’s new. Perhaps It’s what brought the changes. That part hasn’t shoved “me” out.

I think the It parts within the others overtook them entirely. Maybe they gave in to their wants and desires. The need to escape. That makes sense for both Davie and Sasha. My only want was to earn my way. Maybe that determination allowed me to hold on. Or perhaps I have also changed irrevocably, and I haven’t even noticed. That thought does scare me. Maybe Sasha doesn’t think she’s changed all that much, either. Occasionally, I catch my mom looking at me for too long (she doesn’t know about my new eating habits), but I don’t know if that’s all in my head. My It part does fuel me; it is easier to be successful now. I graduated from my AA program and decided to teach myself to code while I waited to earn enough to move to my new city. But is this the end of the developments? How will the group react to me leaving? Thus far Davie doesn’t seem to be doing much with leading anything, just parties but again I’ve only been in this for 6 months. Will I be allowed to just go?

I don’t know what the future holds right now. I hope I’m pulling off blending in because I’m not sure I’m up for fighting for my freedom yet. I’m not even positive that I’ll have to, but my new instincts say to keep to the status quo anyway. 

Yesterday I heard a voice hiss “Wait. We will have our chance.” I hope “our chance” means leaving this town. But I honestly have no idea.
