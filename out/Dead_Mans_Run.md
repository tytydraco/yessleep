It was August of 1995, just a couple days after my 10th birthday. I sat with my dad in his souped-up Camaro, rumbling down one of the many empty roads that wind up and down the Appalachian Mountains. That night, we were partaking in a dying art, one that my mom's side of our family had practiced for generations, and that Dad had joined when they'd gotten married. 

My dad and his whole family line are no strangers to adventure. The furthest back we've found, his family lived in coastal Sweden, building and sailing armed merchant ships in the early 1700s. From there, they were explorers, war heroes, at least one Old West gunfighter, and finally, my dad, David. He's a gearhead through and through, the type of guy who'd buy a car that was little more than a shell, then turn it into the fastest thing in the neighborhood in a matter of weeks. That was exactly what he'd done with the car we were driving that night, his prized 1969 Chevy Camaro, fully specced out for road racing, as well as the activities we'd gotten up to that night. You see, my maternal relatives were from southeastern Tennessee, where my parents still live today, and they were long-time producers of moonshine whiskey. My dad was the latest one to help them run loads of it to customers, and he took to it without a second thought. 

Back to that night. Like I said before, I'd just turned 10 years old that day, and I was pretty excited to be on this trip. Even in my short life up to that point, I couldn't count the number of times I'd heard that angry little small-block V8 roar to life in the barn, and listened to it howl into the night as my dad sped off to some hidden meeting place with a batch of white lightning in his trunk. On so many of those nights, I'd begged Mom to let me go along, but she'd always said no. As time went on, Dad told stories of high-speed chases and shootouts with revenue agents, dangerous mountain roads that could've led to his death at any moment, and the countless other hazards that he'd run into, and I began to understand why I was never allowed to go. This run, though, took us on one of the least-used stretches of road in the region around our little holler, and he'd reasoned that it would be safe enough for me to tag along.

The night wasn't all that dark, to start with. The Camaro's headlights, plus the fog lights Dad had fixed to the front bumper, illuminated the road ahead of us with no trouble, and even without them, we had the brilliant full moon and millions of stars above us to light our way. We cruised along the wide two-lane highway at a casual 80MPH, the race-spec engine under the hood in front of us purring like a contented mountain lion. I sat in the front next to Dad, tightly strapped into the deep, padded bucket seat with a racing harness, since the back seats had been replaced with a big roll bar. A few minutes into the drive, he looked at me, a small smile visible through his short, scruffy beard.

"How's it going, Wingman?" Dad asked me. He called me that anytime I road with him in his car, and hearing it on this occasion made me feel like I really was his wingman, by his sude through whatever the night would bring.

"Good!" I replied, clearly very excited to be there with him. Dad took his hand off of the leather-wrapped steering wheel and ruffled my blonde hair, the same color as Mom's, before grabbing it tightly and fixing his eyes on the road once more.

"Y'know, there are lots of stories about the route we'll be taking tonight," he told me.

"Like what?" I asked.

"Like I said, lots of them. One, though, has always been my favorite," he said, clearly trying to entice me to ask about it. I didn't bother to resist the urge to do so, my childish curiosity more than getting the better of me.

"Ooo, what is it?" I asked.

"Well..." he said, suddenly taking on the demeanor of a campsite storyteller, preparing to spin a yarn of ghouls and goblins. "They say this road is haunted by the ghost of a moonshine runner, who died doing exactly what we are now," he began. I was immediately hooked, although a small icicle of fear began growing in the pit of my stomach at the mention of a haunting, one which we were headed straight for.

"A ghost?" I asked, convincing myself that it was just a story, and that I was a big kid, so I should be brave enough to listen to it.

"Oh, yeah, a ghost. Your Great-Uncle Junior told me this story, right after your mom and I got married and started running 'shine together," Dad went on. "They say his name was Benny Floyd. He had a big load of whiskey in his trunk, and half-a-dozen revenuers on his tail. This was after your Great-Grandpa Orville had made his big run and dodged more than double that, so this guy was feeling cocky," he continued. I felt the fear slowly growing in my stomach, the cold taking over my innards more and more with each moment, but I couldn't not hear the story to its completion.

"What happened to him?" I asked, making myself press on.

"Well, he was a good driver, but not good enough. He got onto County Highway 5, right up ahead of us, and he tried to make his escape," Dad told me, pointing ahead of us to indicate that the road was coming up. "Story goes, one of the revenuers shot out his tire. He lost control and went flying into the ditch, broke open every jar of white lightning he was carrying. What's worse, the sparks from the crash touched off the whiskey, and the whole car went up in flames. Junior said you could hear the explosion for ten miles," he continued, making a gesture like an explosion with his free hand while he used the other to drive.

"Then what?" I pressed him, feeling the icicle turn into a full-on blizzard in my gut as the tension in the rest of my body grew.

"Folks who drove that road at night started hearing odd noises, seeing odd things. Some up and disappeared, and their cars showed up in the ditch, burnt to a crisp," he told me. "The ones who made it through said they could hear a car going by, right next to them, when there was nobody there. They could hear the engine rumbling, and tires screeching as they passed the curve where he'd gone off the road. They said they saw headlights speeding up behind them in their rearview mirror, but just as the car was about to rear-end them, it would just... vanish," he said. "Sometimes, they'd even have that same old Buick pull right up next to them, burning like a log in a fire, a big cloud of black smoke in its wake," he went on. "They said when they looked over, they saw a man at the wheel, but he wasn't a man anymore. No, he was just a shadow shaped like one, and as soon as their eyes met, he'd be gone, just like that."

"Is... is he still around?" I asked, some part of me needing to know whether or not we'd encounter the ghost of Benny Floyd on our trip that very night.

"No one knows for sure, but those who believe it say he still haunts that road, chasing down cars whenever he sees fit, especially the ones carrying a load... like we are tonight. They say he owns that road, and that's where it got the name Dead Man's Run," Dad said, giving me a coy look. At this point, fear overtook my excitement, and I sputtered in hopes of finding a rational explanation to it all.

"That's just a story, right? Ghosts aren't real," I said. Dad smiled and chuckled, his eyes returning to the road once again.

"Oh, yeah, it's just a story. Well, a guy named Benny Floyd did die running 'shine on this road, but the rest is all made up," he reassured me. I breathed a sigh of relief, and suddenly, I felt myself lurch forward slightly as my dad took his foot off of the gas, gently pressing the brakes and downshifting to slow the car for a turn. I looked to the left, and there it was, a narrow, dubiously-paved road into the deep, dark woods. The sign read Donahue County Highway 5, but I knew its real name, Dead Man's Run. I took a deep breath in and out, trying to steel my rattled nerves as we made the turn onto the overgrown asphalt. Dad turned and looked at me, visibly feeling bad that he'd shaken me so severely.

"Did I scare you, buddy?" he asked me.

"No," I hastily and blatantly lied. Dad chuckled, reaching over once more to pat me on the shoulder. 

"Like I said, it's just a story," he firmly stated once again. "And even if we do run into any ghosts, I'll be right here to protect you." That made me feel better than anything else he'd said, and I truly did believe him. Little did either of us know that his protection would prove to be very important that night.
