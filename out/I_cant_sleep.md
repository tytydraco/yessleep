Hi, I'm Talan. Nights used to be my sanctuary, a time to escape into dreams and forget the worries of the day. Lately, though, my peaceful nights have become a haunting nightmare, and I can't escape the feeling that I'm being watched.  
  
It all started about a week ago, during a stormy night. Rain hammered against my window, and thunder echoed through the darkness. Lightning painted eerie shapes on my bedroom walls. Wrapped in my blanket, I tried to ignore the unsettling atmosphere, but that's when it began – a low, guttural growl emanating from the shadows of my room.  
  
At first, I chalked it up to the storm, dismissing it as a figment of my imagination. But as the nights passed, the growl persisted, growing louder and more menacing. Shadows seemed to slither and crawl across the walls, and my once comforting nightlight now cast eerie, dancing shapes that fueled my unease.  
  
I tried to share my fears with my parents, but they brushed it off as childhood anxieties, assuring me that monsters weren't real. Still, the unsettling feeling lingered, and each night became a battle for sleep.  
  
One night, unable to bear it any longer, I decided to investigate. I tiptoed across the room, the growl intensifying with every step. As I opened the closet door, a gust of cold wind extinguished my nightlight. In the darkness, a pair of glowing eyes met mine – an otherworldly shade of crimson filled with an inexplicable hunger.  
  
The growl reached a deafening pitch as the creature emerged. It was a grotesque entity, a tangle of limbs and scales with a gaping maw lined with razor-sharp teeth. The air turned thick with the stench of decay as it slithered toward me, its eyes never breaking their gaze.  
  
Panic gripped me, and I stumbled backward, my legs entangled in bedsheets. The creature circled, and I felt its hot breath on my face. I screamed for my parents, who rushed in as the door burst open. But when I pointed to the creature, it vanished, leaving only the lingering scent of decay.  
  
My parents, concerned yet unconvinced, tried to reassure me. They left the bedroom light on, but the creature returned, always lurking just beyond the glow. Sleep became a distant memory, replaced by the relentless fear that gripped my soul each night.  
  
As I write this, the growl persists, and shadows in my room seem to dance with a life of their own. The creature is real, and it won't let me forget it. I'm trapped in a waking nightmare, haunted by its presence in the shadows, always watching, always waiting for the moment darkness claims me.  
  
I don't know how much longer I can endure this torment. The monster is always there, just out of sight, waiting for the perfect moment to reveal itself and claim its next victim. If you hear a growl in the night, if shadows dance in the corners of your room, don't dismiss it as a child's imagination. The monster may be closer than you think.
