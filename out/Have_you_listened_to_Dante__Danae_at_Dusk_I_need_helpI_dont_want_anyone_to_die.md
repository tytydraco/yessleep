Maybe I should ignore it.

I’m just tired. Too many long nights and lonely hotel rooms, that’s what I tell myself.

These goddamn flights, man; they do a number on you. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve bickered back and forth with Barry. He’s my boss, but he doesn’t act like it. There is a reason why fieldwork in my industry is typically thrown to the young guys–your sleep cycle won't be the same for another week and the food vouchers aren’t nearly enough.

One after another, these things add up.

But he insists on me completing these pipe inspections in small-town Saskatchewan. It’s a dusty place filled with common folk—oil workers and farmers—and not a whole lot else. It’s a good thing, I suppose, having twelve-hour days and little else around you but work. Boredom can breed trouble, as a lot of the other field operators will tell you at some of our less busy but livelier locations. Counting pipe is never fun and those boys that work in the yard their entire life are a different kind of feral animal.

I was just happy to get the hell out.

I don’t know how else to explain it…but I'm desperate. I’m putting this wifi package to good use in order to elicit help, and believe me, if I had any other options, I'd use them. Selfishly, I hope you can carry some of the weight off of my shoulders. I don’t think I can make this decision on my own.

Every seat is occupied on this red-eye flight. I’m sitting here as they run through the safety protocol. No one is listening. A baby is crying.

I’m seated in a middle seat, sandwiched between a stale old woman and a chunky fellow in a leather coat. The woman is holding her reading glasses to her face and squinting at a weathered novel. The other man looks relaxed, a little too comfortable on the shared armrest, so I give him a nudge that he doesn’t seem to appreciate. Under my breath, I’m repeating my standard flight mantra:

*Just get off the runway. Just get off the runway.*

And finally–the cabin rumbles. The jet engines roar, and we shoot out of a cannon, our tin rocketship, into the sky.

The pressure normalizes, and we begin to coast thirty thousand feet above the air. The lights above the overhead compartment turn off; there only remains a runway of tiny illuminated circles upon the spotty green carpet. The flight attendants disappear to the back, mingling amongst themselves.

I plug my headphones into the monitor in front of me. Scrolling through the recycled movies, I opt to play some music from a selection of preloaded tracks instead. Hard Rock Hits: Pink Floyd, Def Leppard, Metallica. A little classics never hurt nobody.

All I was after was a distraction, like everybody else.

I begin to drift, my eyelids heavy, as the drums and bass soothe me into slumber.

I don’t know how long I was out before I heard it. This static, hissing like white noise, only more pronounced, like frenetic whispers in my ears.

An upbeat voice spoke, crackling into my headphones and replacing the static.

*Welcome back to Dante & Denae at Dusk. Playing the music you’ll never forget. We’ve got a great lineup for you this evening, as always, you deplorable little beasts. But first, let’s get to our lucky listener.*

The screen flickers black for a moment before returning to normal.

*Danae—who is our lucky Musketeer?*

A second voice–a female, just as peppy and sing-songy–chimes in:

*Passenger 18B. You’re up!*

I stare at my crumpled ticket stub stuffed inside the mesh storage pouch in front of me. I gulp.

*Congratulations!* he says\*. You’re our lucky captain for the evening. Ready to play “All For One Or One For All”?\*

My eyes scan the rows of seats: people from all walks of life glued to their monitors. Their screens are bright, playing an assortment of movie re-runs or television shows. No one else's eyes are wide with horror, they are in a trance, hypnotized by the entertainment.

*Are you ready to play?* she asks\*.\*

I yank the headphones out of my ears and unbuckle my seat belt. Rubbing my eyes, I dart for the washrooms at the back of the plane. There is a lineup of people in the aisle, so I wait, impatiently bouncing in place.

I’m only there for a moment before the plane rocks. It jolts from left to right in a precarious pocket of turbulence. An elderly lady falls flat on her face. I stumble into the person seated in the row across from me. Garbage slides into the aisle off of people's extended trays. Screams rain out from all directions.

Then the rockiness subsides. I retreat to the washroom and splash some water on my face.

*Get it together,* I urge myself.

I leave the sardine can of a washroom, my face still dripping. The elderly lady exits her seat and offers me a faint smile as I scoot past her and sink into mine. My chunky friend is now snoring in violent, choking gasps that I self-diagnose as sleep apnea. He has claimed the shared armrest as his pillow.

Below the airplane icon, in the corner of the screen, reads three hours and twenty-two minutes until our final destination. I stare at the bright screen in the darkness, and sigh. The headphones and the eerie mystery still seem to call out to me. Out of curiosity, and maybe to convince myself, I plug them back into the monitor and place them in my ears.

*Are you ready, Simon?* Her sudden, silky voice makes me recoil.

I nervously scan the rows again. No one else seems to be raising any level of concern.

*You see what happens when you don’t play?* he says.

And the plane jerks from side to side again.

He continues: *It’s a simple game, Simon. What do you say?*

My throat tightens. I can feel my hands trembling on the armrest like a bad tremor.

*This dead air doesn’t make for great air time,* she says.

Into the speaker attached to my headphones, a shaky *no* escapes my lips.

*No?* The female voice replies with a mocking inflection.

The male voice chuckles. *I think you should hear the rules first, Simon, before you make your decision.*

My palms are soaking. I can feel the anxiety clawing at my insides. But I don’t want to make a scene. So I do the only thing I can think of. My hand instinctively jumps overhead and presses the help button. There is a tiny beep as the light blinks.

*You shouldn’t have done that, Simon,* the woman says.

One of the attendants pushes through the curtains and politely strolls up to our row. “Hi, there. You rang?”

Without thinking, I pull the earbuds out of my ears and hand them to her. “I…I think there is something wrong with the music.”

She raises an eyebrow. “Oh, okay. Let me check it out.” She glances at the screen with a puzzled expression and places the earbuds in her ears.

The snoring and snorting from beside me seems to intensify, as if someone were choking a pig.

She clears her throat and meets my eyes. “I’m sorry—and what seems to be the problem exactly?” She hands me one of the earbuds and we both listen. It’s the middle of *Stairway to Heaven* and Jimmy Page is ripping out his legendary guitar riff.

“I...” I stammer, “Weird. It was playing some sort of strange radio station. Has anyone else experienced this?”

She hands me back the other headphone. Before she can speak, her eyes roll back into her skull. All I see are her whites and their red veiny trails, and then her mouth stretches excruciatingly wide. Everything happens in the blink of a second, but I swear, I see a skinny plume of smoke escape from the gaping hole. The cloud swirls as it travels deeper into the recesses of the cabin, vanishing amongst the shadows. Then she drops across the aisle like a chopped-down tree. Her head slams against a metal panel on the floor. The passengers in close vicinity gasp and scramble to help.

“Is there a doctor?” someone yells.

She convulses on the floor; foam sputtering out of her mouth. The commotion begins to incite widespread panic from the rest of the passengers. A crowd circles around the woman whose body is still spasming in the row across from me. Another flight attendant slinks around the group and sprints toward the cockpit.

A lady with a bob cut and a baggy tracksuit steps forward and cradles the shaking flight attendant's head. “I’m a nurse. Please, everyone, I'm going to need you to give her some space.”

I slip the earbuds back into my ears as I watch the terror unfold. The guitar solo ceases and the static slowly takes over.

*Welcome back, Simon.* He says, *See what happens if you tell the others?*

She asks,  *Are you ready now?*

My lips tremble as I say, yes.

*Excellent!* he says. Some fake applause play. *Our Musketeer rules are simple: You decide—one for all or all for one.*

My heart is pounding rapidly. There are tiny rips in the armrest from my grip.

*One to save them all—sacrifice yourself to save the helpless baby, the poor flight attendant on the floor, and the man sleeping peacefully beside you. You in exchange for them.*

The man begins to jostle in his seat. He is still asleep, but in mid-snore a puff of smoke billows out. I shield myself, the cloud passing through me as quick as a gust of wind. It has the noxious smell of rot.

*Or all for one—Every man, woman, and child goes up in a pillar of harrowing flames. The only survivor being…you.*

“Someone grab the emergency kit! We need an AED stat,” the nurse passenger screams. One of the flight attendants rushes down the aisle.

*Choose wisely.* The female urges.

“And…if I don’t choose?” I whisper into the headphones.

Suddenly the intercom sparks to life.

“Attention passengers. This is your captain, Dale, speaking. We’ve been informed of the medical emergency and are planning an emergency landing.”

The seat belt image lights up above.

“Everyone please return to your seat, excluding those directly aiding the passenger. Brace yourself. Prepare for landing.”

*Look outside,* the male voice says.

I turn to my right at the sleeping man and the shade concealing the window. It seems impossible to still be asleep given all of the chaos. I cautiously reach across him and pull the shutter up. There is a tiny red blinking light at the far end of the wing, but just before it, I could make out a shadowy silhouette perched upon the smooth aluminum. The pressure, the speed at which we were traveling, the lack of a grip or hold, given all of that, the thing stands erect like a statue, neglecting the laws of physics. It cranes its neck towards the window and spreads its wings wide, flapping them a few times to heed attention.

The male voice asks in a playful tone, *If he doesn’t choose, Danae, what happens?*

A flock of these large creatures (my best guess is vultures, but it is hard to tell amidst the darkness and the barren landscape below) begin to swoop in. Some sit atop the wing, while others continue their flight alongside the aircraft.

She giggles. *You all perish.*

The winged creatures slide off the aircraft and fly away, out of sight.

I figure all it would take is one to collide with the engine.

My stomach turns as the descent begins and the plane plunges downward. The walls of the cabin begin to vibrate.

*Well then, Simon. You haven’t left yourself much time. Just a couple of minutes until it all goes Ka-bloom,* the male voice laughs.

The female chimes in:

*This is some right drama, aint it? You’re welcome to all of you Ghouls & Goblins from the treacherous depths of hell. And thank you for listening to Dante & Danae at Dusk: bringing you all the hits, so you just can’t quit. Stay tuned to see what our friend Simon decides.*

The static dies and the familiar melody takes over. The shredding guitar of Angus Young blares into my headphones:

*Highway to* [*hell*](https://www.reddit.com/r/aproyal/comments/kpu2co/please_read_if_you_enjoyed_any_of_my_stories/)*.*
