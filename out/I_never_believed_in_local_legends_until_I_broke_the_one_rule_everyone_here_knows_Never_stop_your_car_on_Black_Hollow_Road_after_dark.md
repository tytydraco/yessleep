I never believed in local legends until I broke the one rule everyone here knows: *Never stop your car on Black Hollow Road after dark.*

I learned why last night.

# The Warning

I've lived in Millfield my entire life. It's the kind of small town where everyone knows everyone, where the diner's pie is still warm at midnight, and where certain stories get passed down like family heirlooms. The kind of stories that make parents lower their voices when telling them.

Black Hollow Road is one of those stories.

A narrow, winding stretch of cracked asphalt, it cuts through six miles of dense forest between town and the highway. During the day, it's just another country road—quiet, shaded by ancient oaks, the kind of place teenagers go to park and make out. But after sunset? That's when the rules matter.

Every kid in Millfield grows up hearing them:

1. **No stopping**—not for deer, not for breakdowns, *especially* not for people.
2. **Keep your lights on high beam** no matter what you see.
3. **If your radio static cuts out**, don't adjust it. That means you're almost through.

Old man Garner at the garage told me the full story when I was sixteen. His hands shook as he wiped grease off a wrench, his voice dropping to a whisper. *"Back in '78, the Dawson family pulled over to fix a flat. They found the tire changed itself by morning. Problem was, the thing that did it was still in the car with them when the sun came up."*

We all laughed about it back then—until the Thompson twins vanished our sophomore year. Their Bronco was found idling in the middle of the road, driver's door hanging open, keys still in the ignition. The seatbelts had been tied into perfect nooses.

After that, nobody laughed about Black Hollow Road anymore.

# The First Mistake

Last night, I broke rule number one.

I was driving home late after closing up at the diner. Rain sheeted down, turning the road into a black mirror. My headlights barely cut through the downpour. The radio spat static, just like always on this stretch.

Then, at exactly 11:47 PM, I saw her.

A girl stood barefoot in the center of the road, wearing a soaked white nightgown. The rain plastered her dark hair to a face I *almost* recognized—like someone I'd seen in an old yearbook. Her mouth moved like she was screaming, but the radio static drowned her out.

My foot hovered over the brake. Every cell in my body screamed at me to stop. She looked so real, so *human*.

That's when she turned her head—*too far, like an owl*—and I saw the jagged stitches where her jawbone should've been.

Tires screeched as I swerved around her. The radio went dead silent.

*Almost through.*

# The Second Mistake

I should've kept my eyes on the road.

But like an idiot, I glanced in the rearview mirror.

She was in the backseat.

Rainwater dripped from her nightgown, pooling on the leather seats. She leaned forward, those awful stitches stretching with a wet *snap*. Her whisper smelled like swamp rot: *"You looked."*

The car filled with the sound of thread being pulled through flesh.

I stomped on the gas, my heart hammering against my ribs. The trees blurred past as the speedometer climbed—50, 60, 70 mph. Cold fingers brushed the back of my neck.

*"Faster,"* she breathed.

# The Third Mistake

I screamed.

Her hand clamped over my mouth—*cold and webbed*—as she giggled. *"Shhh. You'll wake the others."*

That's when I noticed the shapes moving in the woods. Tall things with too many joints, stepping onto the road behind us. Their limbs moved all wrong, like puppets controlled by a drunkard.

The radio crackled to life with a voice that wasn't human: *"STOP THE VEHICLE."*

# Why I'm Still Alive

I don't know how I made it to town. The last thing I remember is the girl's laughter ringing in my ears as the streetlights of Millfield appeared through the rain.

I'm writing this from Garner's garage. My car's here too, though the mechanics won't touch it. Not after they saw the handprints *inside* the locked gas tank.

The girl's gone, but I keep finding black threads in my hair. They're always wet, no matter how many times I shower.

And last night, my radio turned itself on at 11:47 PM. Just static at first.

Then a whisper: *"You forgot rule #4."*

I never heard a rule #4.

But this morning, I found it scratched into my bathroom mirror:

**"Don't scream when they come inside."**
