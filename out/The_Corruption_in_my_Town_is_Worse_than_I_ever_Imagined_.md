Corruption is an interesting beast. It can start so slowly that a normal person can barely notice it. It can be as simple as the town board skimming a few hundred or thousand dollars out of the budget for themselves. Or when you notice that potholes that normally used to get filled up in a timely matter suddenly start to infest the roads. But it’s a slippery slope once corruption starts to take root. That picturesque town that you once grew up in starts to decay all around you as more people at the top continue to line their own pockets with their ill-gotten goods. The cops start harassing you more than usual in search of bullshit reasons to give you a ticket to bring in more money. 



Well, I decided to investigate where this labyrinth of corruption led. I didn’t go to school to become an investigative journalist for nothing after all. I made it my mission to finally figure out who was at the top of this pyramid of corruption and to finally expose it for the world to see. A noble goal if I do say so. It would also put me on the map as a journalist so I was also killing that bird with the same stone. So I set to work and was immediately confronted by plenty of roadblocks. 



Turns out when you go around loudly announcing that you are going to be searching for corruption, people clam up real tight. But I wasn’t deterred because I knew one group of people who would be more than willing to help me in my investigation. The drug addicts. Say what you will about them, they are an incredibly valuable source of information. The high-functioning ones especially, as they form a sort of de facto leadership over other addicts to keep them safe, so they have eyes and ears open in all directions. And I just so happen to be best friends with one such addict. 



“Hey, Mikey!” I greeted my old college roommate as I entered into his little tent city kingdom underneath the freeway bridge. Despite being the same age he looked much older and worn out, but despite his shabby clothes and greasy looks he still had the same fire he had in his eyes when we had been in college together. 



“You son of a bitch!” he told me with excitement as he came over to me and threw his arms around me in a tight squeeze. Being a heroin addict hadn’t weakened his strength by much as he nearly broke my back from his hug. “What’re you doing here? You thinking of joining the community?” Mikey laughed as he let me go and gave me a hard slap on the back. 



“No, not yet anyway,” I told him with a smile, throwing my arm around him and tussling his hair to get back at him for nearly breaking me in half. “No I’m looking for information, working on a big story and I figured I’d start by asking around for info,” I told him, as I quickly got out my notepad and looked at him excitedly. 



“We’ll you’ve come to the right place! What is it you want to know?” He motioned for me to sit down at a makeshift table made from one of those giant wooden spools. Despite the unfortunate circumstances of a lot of the addicts under the bridge, the one thing they didn’t lack was at least a sense of comfort. Mikey’s little kingdom had plenty of tents and mattresses for people to live and sleep in. And his cheery and loving personality never failed to make it seem like a loving and open place. 



“I’m looking for evidence of corruption. Not just the petty kind, I wanna see where all of it leads.” I told Mikey, placing my phone on the wooden table and clicking the record button. I wasn’t the fastest writer so having a recording was another way for me to capture anything I might’ve missed. 



“Well, that’s a tall order dude,” Mikey said, running his hand through his sandy brown hair. “Most of us only experience the crooked cop who shakes us down for money. But if you want to start somewhere that’s the best place to start I suppose.” Mikey shrugged as he reached into his bag next to him and pulled out some plastic water bottles for us. 



“Do you know anyone here who gets regularly picked on by the cops? Maybe someone who’s seen something shady going on?” I asked Mikey as I thanked him for the water and took a quick swig of it. Mikey stroked his chin as he thought long and hard. Despite being high functioning there was still plenty of evidence of his addictions. The track marks and his overall twitchy demeanor were a dead giveaway.



“I think one of the crackheads might be able to help you.” He looked up at me with a sudden spark in his eyes. “I remember one of them saying something about a secret meeting he saw taking place near the warehouse district.” I perked up instantly at this info. Quickly scribbling that down and asking Mikey where I could meet this crackhead. He stood up from the table and started leading me towards the section of the bridge reserved for the crackheads. They were usually more violent than the others so they were kept away from people for everyone's safety. 



“Hey, Kim.” Mikey greeted the crackhead who had her head in a barrel searching for something. She immediately shot her head up out of the barrel and stared at the two of us. Seeing it was Mikey she calmed down a little but she was still clearly uncomfortable with me being there with him. “This is my friend, Miguel.” I waved hello to her. “He’s got some questions to ask you.” 



“I didn’t do anything!” she screamed at me, probably assuming I was some cop or something. She quickly produced a taser from her pocket and pointed it at me. My hands immediately shot up and I stared at Mikey who was surprisingly calm about all this. 



“We know you didn’t Kim. Miguel isn’t a cop, he’s a journalist and he wanted to know about what you saw at the warehouses.” Mikey told her calmly. At the mention of that Kim’s mouth dropped open and she quickly shoved the taser back into her pocket, looking around to make sure no one was watching, she quickly walked closer to us. 



“I saw a bunch of guys in suits meeting in one of the abandoned warehouses. And a giant limo pulled up after a bit,” she told me quickly. I nodded and wrote it down, glad I was still recording with my phone in my pocket. “I saw a guy in a wheelchair get wheeled out and join them in the meeting. Then I heard loud screaming! Real loud like someone was getting murdered!” Kim told us, twitching rather violently and scratching at her neck, quickly looking around in terror. “When it was done that guy in the wheelchair got wheeled back out into the limo and took off.” 



I looked over at Mikey with a raised brow. He shrugged at me and I looked back at Kim. I didn’t exactly know how much of her story to believe. But even if a fraction of what she said was true then I needed to get to the warehouse district before night fell. 



“Thanks, dude, I appreciate it,” I told Mikey as he was seeing me safely out of the homeless camp. He nodded and followed me to my car. 



“Make sure you stay safe dude. When you start messing with shit like this, you’re liable to end up dead.” He told me as I got into my car and rolled down the window to keep talking to him. “And make sure you don’t get consumed by this story. You should know when to quit if it gets too dangerous.” 



“I can’t do that, Mikey,” I told him as I started the car fully. “I have to expose this, no matter what happens to me. People have a right to know where their taxes are going. And to make sure someone is held accountable for this.” I told him. He chuckled and shook his head. 



“Typical journalist major.” He teased me, getting a laugh from me. 



“Coming from the poli-sci major?” We both laughed uncontrollably and I parted after giving him my last box of cigarettes as payment for helping me. As it was getting late in the afternoon, I decided to head to the gas station first before making my way to the other side of town; to the warehouse district. I filled up on gas, snacks, and the always-important boxes of cigarettes. It was going to be a long night of staking out so I was coming prepared. 



The upside to corruption is that the single guard at the warehouse district was simple enough to bribe to let me through to my location. He took my money without even a second thought and let me into the warehouses. Most of them are abandoned and the few that aren’t will be soon. So if there was any place to have a shady meeting this would be it. 



I took up a position just near the entrance so I could watch anyone come in and leave and started the long process of waiting for something to happen. It was damn near 2 in the morning when something finally happened. I was outside my car taking my 15th smoke break when I suddenly noticed a long line of cars suddenly turning up at the gate. I quickly dropped my cigarette and stomped on it, quickly ducking back into my car to make sure no one noticed me. I was lucky that most of the lamps around the warehouses were broken and so once my cigarette was out, I was practically invisible in the darkness. 



I watched in this total darkness as this convoy of cars started rolling through the gate and towards a warehouse. And to my surprise, one of them was indeed a limo. So Kim had been right this whole time. Starting my car as silently as I could and keeping the lights off, I waited for the limo to drive past, waiting 30 seconds and then driving after them. The warehouse wasn’t too far away from the entrance so as soon as I saw them starting to park I ducked my car into a nearby warehouse. Parking quickly, I grabbed my phone and dashed out as quickly as I could. 



Aided by the darkness and overcast night, it was relatively easy to sneak towards the warehouse meeting. And to my immense luck, there was even a pile of trash for me to hide behind, and I eagerly took this opportunity given to me. I hid behind it and poked my head out to see who was going to this meeting. 



I was surprised to see a lot of people I didn’t recognize. Many of them in suits and a few of them even in police uniforms. I wondered to myself if these were from neighboring towns. My suspicions were confirmed when in one of the cars the mayors of my town and three neighboring ones exited together. I quickly took out my camera and made sure the flash was off, using only the light of the nearby working street lamp to illuminate my picture. 



“I can’t believe he has us meeting here again.” The mayor of my town, Austin Tweed groaned as he rubbed his eyes with his fat fingers. He was a large man and had been mayor for as long as I could remember. “What more can we give him? Pretty soon he’s going to want to take over the entire county,” he grumbled annoyed. 



“As long as he keeps paying us, I could care less what he does. Why are you complaining so much? Big guy like you want a bigger cut?” An older man with wispy gray hair chuckled. I recognized him as Elias Crump, the longtime mayor of our neighboring village. I wasn’t surprised at all to see him there, the man seemed to have been born in the swamp of corruption. 



“Look out, here he comes,” Tweed suddenly said, turning everyone’s attention, including my own towards the limo that had been ominously waiting nearby. I watched and took pics of a nurse leaving the passenger side door and start walking toward the back doors. She looked frail and was barely able to stand on two legs as she reached the door to the limo and opened it. I watched as a ramp was lowered and a man in a wheelchair was pushed out into the open. To describe him as a man would be grossly misleading. He looked more like a corpse confined to an ancient wooden wheelchair. His business suit barely clung to his seemingly emaciated and a silver mask was stuck to his face. 



“Good evening, Mr. LeBlanc,” Mayor Tweed told the corpse in a wheelchair. I watched as he was pushed out of the limo by a second more healthier looking nurse. 



“You will refer to him as Monsieur,” this second nurse ordered of the gathered mayors. She was stern and authoritarian looking. “That is the proper way to greet Monsieur LeBlanc.” That name rang a bell in my mind, the LeBlancs were well known in several states in the great plains. Rumors swirled about them, that they were cursed and had made their vast money during the slave trade. If this was a LeBlanc he appeared to be at the end of his rope. 



“Forgive me, Monsieur.” Mayor Tweed corrected which seemed to stir the corpse back to life as it took a long ragged breath and rose slightly from his chair. 



“Thank you all for meeting me here, once again.” His voice was like nothing I had ever heard before. Despite his relative proximity to me and even being behind a mask, his voice sounded distant and echoey. Almost like it was hollow in some way. “Some unexpected things have occurred, and I’ll require new permits. I’m sure you all will be accommodating as you’ve always been.” Once he had finished his little speech he seemingly collapsed back into his chair, wheezing something fierce. I wondered if he needed some sort of permit for his mausoleum from how badly his wheezes sounded.  



“Of course!” Mayor Crump said, giddy with excitement. “I assume this has to do with the grain silo you have on your property? The one we discussed during the last meeting?” he asked as he approached the invalid. Did the LeBlancs have a property nearby I’d never heard of? This isn’t exactly the area a millionaire man of influence would be living in. The large group soon disappeared into the warehouse. I contemplated staying around, but I didn’t want to push my luck. 



A few days later I stared at the newspaper, wondering aloud to myself as I read the headline article. “Village Save from Bankruptcy!” The details were scarce, and only mentioned a substantial bailout from a secret third party. I had only one guess who that had been. In need of more information, I made my way back to my most valuable source of information. 



“Back so soon, huh? Thinking of moving in?” Mikey asked with a chuckle as he crushed some tin cans. He’d get a couple cents for all of them so it was one of the few sources of money available to him. 



“Not yet.” I smiled as I sat down next to him and helped him crush some cans. “What do you know about the LeBlancs?” I asked him. He looked at me with absolute terror in his eyes when I mentioned them. 



“Why? What’d you find out the other night?” he asked me, quickly leaving his duties of can crushing and standing up. 



“A LeBlanc was there, an old dude in a wheelchair, barely alive by the looks of it. He was talking with Twee, Crump, Jefferson, Harley, all of the mayors of nearby towns. And this morning I learned that we got bailed out by a mystery millionaire. Do you know anything about him?” Mikey was looking around and quickly pulled me into his tent, various books and magazines lay around inside. 



“He’s a monster,” he told me as he motioned for me to close the flap of the tent. “Before I ended up living under the bridge I ran for city council. He visited my campaign HQ. Told me to basically serve him and he’d allow me to win. I of course politely told him to fuck off. Ended up losing the race and everything else.” Mikey sighed and looked up at me. “Miguel this isn’t someone you should be going up against.” 



“I have to try Mike,” I told him. And I was going to try until I found the truth or they found my body washed up from the river. And Mikey knew this. He sighed reaching over to one of his books and pulling out a travel map. Unfolding it in his tent he looked around for a bit and then pointed to a rectangle drawn out on the map. 



“That’s his property. Over 3,000 acres. His house is right here and he’s got some kind of abandoned silo here. My main guess as to why he’s got all the mayors in his pocket is-” 



“His property is right in the middle of all of them.” I interrupted Mikey as I saw that indeed like a tumor his property touched every surrounding town and village next to it. At the mention of the silo, I remembered back to the night of seeing him. “Where’s the silo again?” Mikey pointed it out to me. 



“Kinda weird that it’s so far away from his house.” Mikey noticed. And indeed it was almost at the complete edge of his property. “Thanks, Mikey,” I told him as I stood up and took the map. As I was about to leave, he quickly grabbed me by the arm and stared up at me with fear in his bright eyes. 



“Don’t get yourself killed.” He told me. I looked at him and nodded. Knowing full well that come hell or high water I was going to learn what LeBlanc had on his property. 



It took a few days for me to get everything ready, but at 3 in the morning I took off toward the LeBlanc property. It was a quiet and tense drive. Not a single car was on the road and even the moon was gone because of a new moon. Following the map since I had no signal out here, I came upon the beginning of the LeBlanc property. Parking my car on the side of the road I approached the fence that surrounded his property. 



Looking at the fence for a moment, I grabbed a nearby stick and tossed it at the fence, and to my surprise, it wasn’t electrified. This was going to be easier than I thought as I climbed over the wire fence and trespassed right onto the giant ranch. Clicking my flashlight to life I scanned around for some sort of structure. I squinted my eyes in the near pitch black to try and find the silhouette of a building. I scanned the horizon and found that just ahead of me, a giant structure was blotting out the stars that should’ve been there. That must’ve been the silo. 



I figured it was the best possible place to start and began making my way over to it. I was conscious of every noise I made, every single branch snap and grass rustle reverberated in my head like a cannon going off. Despite the fact the ranch was so big, I just felt as if every step I took was alerting something to my presence there. As I approached the silo I began to notice an absolutely noxious smell coming from the silo. 



“Jesus, did something die in there?” I whispered as I held my breath. It indeed had the sickly sweet smell that a corpse usually has. I coughed out loud as the smell began to overwhelm me. I quickly took off my jacket and tied it around my mouth for at least a moment of relief from the stench. I increased the power of my flashlight so that I could find a way to enter the silo. It was large and to my annoyance even after circumnavigating the entire structure the only entrance I found was a chained door. I grabbed the chain and tugged at it to gauge how strong it was. 



As I did so something slammed against the inside of the silo and let out a pained screech that nearly ruptured my eardrums. I dropped my flashlight in shock and stared at the silo in horror at the sounds emanating from inside of it. The whole structure seemed to bend and quiver with each strike whatever was inside was making against the sides of it. 



“What the fuck is in there?” I wondered for a moment before deciding better and standing up grabbing my flashlight as I did. There was no way in hell I was going to go inside there if it meant meeting whatever was already inside the silo. So I turned right around and started heading towards my car. That was until I heard metal snapping and bending behind me. Shining my flashlight over towards the silo I stared in horror as the silo began to bend and tear near the padlocked door. And before I could even react the door and the surrounding structure of the silo were torn off and four insect like arms reached out and pulled themselves out of the silo. 



An enormous creature emerged from within the silo. It had the lower body of a spider and with six spindly legs holding it up. But it also had a torso, like some horrible spider centaur. The body attached to the lower spider one was vaguely human shaped but it wasn’t human in the slightest. It had no eyes, but two giant mouths where its face was supposed to be. It even had other mouths across its lower torso. Each of these mouths released a loud shriek that left me almost completely deaf after it had finished. It snapped its head in various directions and I noticed as my light continued to shine on it that it had wispy long black ‘hair’ attached to its head. 



“Oh fuck that!” I screamed as I turned and sprinted towards my car. Whatever that thing was was hopefully blind because it sure as hell didn’t have any eyes that I could see, so I had the advantage of that. I quickly shut my light off and sprinted full force toward my car, hopping over the fence, my foot got caught in the wire and I slammed face first right into the floor. 



I quickly stood back up and wiped my nose, feeling a stream of warm liquid falling from it. I hadn’t broken my nose but I had caused a giant nosebleed. As I looked back up and shined my light back on I let out a horrified scream when I saw the creature hovering over the fence mere inches away from me and snapping its various mouths at me. I quickly backed up and headed over to my car, but before I could I felt something hit my shoulder with a lot of force. I looked down and was surprised to see that I tranquilizer dart was waiting to greet me. 



I looked back over to my car and was blinded when a pair of headlights were turned on in my direction. Squinting to see what it was I saw that it was a nurse, the same one I had seen with LeBlanc at the warehouse. And seated next to her on the road was the living corpse himself. 



“I see. Something did trip the sensor after all,” he said in that holy voice of his, that sent a shiver up my spine with each word spoken. “We arrived just in time.” He snapped his head back over toward the nurse who aimed a rifle at the creature behind us who was in the process of thrashing and screeching against the wire fence that had caught it. The nurse fired a few shots and the creature was struck with several tranquilizers. 



Before I could question anything I felt like the entire world was pulled out from under me as my body crumpled to the floor, but I remained conscious. I groaned and was suddenly lifted from the floor by the nurse and dragged closer to the side of the road. 



“May I ask who you are? Trespasser?” LeBlanc asked me as he leaned down to stare at me like some bug he had found that interested him. I remained tight-lipped though and didn’t say a thing. Though I don’t know if it was my choice or the tranqs that didn’t exactly allow me to do anything. “Perhaps we should have him over for dinner,” LeBlanc said with a strange clicking noise coming from him. 



“What of your mother?” The nurse asked him. “We cannot simply leave her out here.” The nurse said as she lowered her rifle. The creature at the fence let out a groggy hiss before it began to sink into the floor, the tranquilizers finally starting to subdue it. 



“She’s broken out of the silo. For now, we will have to move her to the barn until we can construct a better containment for her. In the meantime, prepare our guest for dinner.” LeBlanc let out more strange clicks as I was dragged away into the waiting car. 



The tranquilizers must’ve knocked me out because the next thing I knew I was sitting at a large table, chained to the chair with several dishes set out in front of me. 



“You’re finally awake.” LeBlanc’s voice pulled my attention over to him. He was seated at the head of the table, wheezing from his wheelchair as his soulless black eyes stared back at me. The mask he wore had the basic features of a human, eyes, nose, and mouth. But something about him rubbed me incredibly wrong. He was uncanny. He looked human but he wasn’t human. As if to prove that point he leaned his head back and revealed that underneath his chin was a mouth, with rows of sharp teeth and mandibles. 



“What the fuck are you?!” I screamed out as I pulled on the handcuffs that kept me bound to the heavy wooden chair. LeBlanc let out more clicks as his body began to twitch and crack. He stood up from his wheelchair and I watched in disbelief as a second pair of legs sprouted out from underneath him. 



“Hard to say,” he told me in his strange voice. I watched that he didn’t move his mouth to make the sounds of a voice. He simply hung his mouth open and the voice came out. “I doubt any scientist has ever given my species as clarification. Although considering only two living members are remaining I doubt they ever will.” He hissed at me, climbing on top of the table and crawling on all his appendages towards me. 



“That thing…was your mother?!” I screamed as I tried to escape the chair, pulling at the handcuffs and having them dig and tear at my wrists. LeBlanc crawled over to me slowly, clearly enjoying my useless flailing. 



“She is. Although at this point she’s hardly better than a rabid animal. She lost her higher brain functions long ago.” LeBlanc told me as he reached my spot at the table and hovered his face over mine, his body clicking and cracking with every move he made. “I keep her around to keep her out of trouble. And perhaps even as thanks for taking care of me.” He produced a slimy long black tongue from within his mouth and licked my face. 



“Get off of me!” I shouted, realizing that my legs weren’t tied down, I shoved myself backward and as I was falling kicked his face as hard as I could with my feet. I slammed into the floor with a hard thud and LeBlanc landed on the other side of the table, landing on his back and quickly flailing around like a bug. 



The fall had broken one of the arms of the chair and I quickly stood up and used my foot to break off the other. I didn’t wait around to see if LeBlanc could flip himself back over, and quickly sprinted out of the dining room. My body was still groggy from the tranquilizers and I was in an unfamiliar setting, but I just simply ran towards where I thought the entrance was. Throwing a door open I found myself face to face with the nurse who had shot me. Before she could react to my being there, I lifted the wooden armrests still attached to me from the handcuffs and swung them at her face, sending her to the floor. 



I quickly ran past her and saw that she’d come from the garage and that the limo was waiting right there and still on. I wasted no time and quickly entered the garage. Before I got far I was tackled to the floor and was bitten hard on the shoulder. I screamed in pain as I looked up to see LeBlanc hovering over me and greedily sucking my blood out. I wiggled and thrashed to try and get him off me, but his weight, height, and extra appendages kept me firmly planted on the floor. 



I thought for sure that I would’ve died there on the floor of LeBlanc’s garage if not for the second nurse who quickly poked her head into the garage and screamed. “She escaped! She’s out of the barn!” 



“What?!” He quickly shouted as he lifted his head back up to look at his other nurse. He looked back down at me and then at her and hissed in annoyance. He let me go and quickly rushed out into the open, at speeds I didn’t think possible. I staggered up from the floor, blood pouring out of me, and quickly entered the limo. 



I winced in pain as I did my best to get it started and drive with only one arm, still weighed down by the armrests stuck to me. I stepped on the gas and flew out of the garage and headed toward the entrance to the ranch. I panted and looked out of the window to see the giant creature sprinting towards the gate with me. I couldn’t let her escape, so I quickly turned and sped straight into her. She screeched in pain and confusion as I ran her over. I must admit how satisfying it was. 



She flailed around and smashed up my windscreen as she went over the hood of the limo. Having successfully hit her, I again gunned it towards the entrance and escaped the ranch. I ditched the limo just outside of town and limped my way towards the bridge where I passed out in Mikey’s arms. 



I deduced that LeBlanc was the source of this corruption. He paid every official he could to keep his secret. And in return, he made sure his targets were rewarded for their cooperation. I also learned that this corruption had been there for decades, maybe even longer. I found evidence of the LeBlancs arriving in the United States in 1850. And every known member of the family was a male. Not a single female LeBlanc has ever been recorded belonging to that family. This led me to the conclusion, he had always been that LeBlanc. He simply changed his first name every few decades. 



And his tendrils spread out everywhere. My research pointed towards the same family first emerging in France. Being nobility, before disappearing during the French Revolution. The family then emerged again in the U.S. He’d been here ever since. Of course, nobody believed me. My story was swept under the rug, and before I knew it, I’d joined Mikey’s tent city. 



But this is my last chance, to tell the truth to the public. All of you reading, even if you don’t believe me, at least you now know the truth. LeBlanc is a parasite, and our only saving grace is that there aren’t more of him. For now.
