Everyone just called it the station.

 The modest name betrayed its true nature though, and did little to warn you of the gargantuan size of the thing. Dozens of trains coming and going at all hours of the day, both above ground and below it, and hundreds of market stalls and shops littering the property. Everyone in town knew about it, knew the rules and the nature of it. When I was young I recall heading there with my mother to peruse the shops, and I remember being absolutely stunned at the size of it all. The items and services being offered were staggeringly diverse, and oftentime downright confusing. As we made our way through I noticed how many signs there were, maps posted everywhere and the same yellow warning sign on every corner. “RETURN TO THE DESIGNATED OVERNIGHT SHELTER, OR VACATE THE PROPERTY BEFORE SUNDOWN.” It read, a stark warning that I was too young to comprehend at the time.

 It's been years since that day now, and I hadn’t visited  The Station since my mother passed. Another childhood memory fallen by the wayside as work, an ailing love life, and other adult responsibilities consumed my time. It was only last week that I decided to take a trip down memory lane and go check it out again. I had lost my job, and I needed something to waste time on. I figured reliving simpler times was as good a time waster as anything, certainly better than blowing all my money at the bar. So I hopped in my car, and made my way there. Twenty minutes later I was walking through the entrance gates.

 The first thing that struck me when I arrived was something I had completely missed when I was a kid. The layout and architecture of the entire place was all screwed up, confusing. Just looking at the little paper map I got at the entrance I could see that this place was built like a maze for whatever reason, like the people who designed it were just scribbling random shit down. The strange nature of it all was driven home when I took in the actual scenery for myself. The architecture and layout of every building was absolutely bizarre, unconventional. It felt like a fever dream. I shook it off though, people come here every day right? I would be fine.

 With my doubts safely tucked away in the back of my mind I spent the day browsing the shops. I bought a few things, and talked to a few people. It was pleasant, overall, and eventually  I decided to make my way down into the subway portion of The Station.  I’d never seen it before and wanted to take a look  before I headed home. That was my first mistake. The Subway had a completely different atmosphere than The Station. The chatter of crowds and the cool, evening breeze were replaced by the buzzing of fluorescent lights, stale air, and an endless maze of identical grey walls. It was suffocating, and I found myself uncomfortable very quickly after I'd left the stairs. About five minutes later I'd found myself at boarding station, and sighed in relief. The open space and groups of people did wonders to ease my anxiety. It even had a concession stand! I wasted no time getting in line to get myself a snack and a bottle of water, my stomach growling.

 As I waited for my turn in line, I heard the rumble of a train. Moments later it was pulling into the station, wheels screeching as it came to a halt. It was the first time I’d actually gotten a good look at one of the trains here, and I wasn’t all that interested until I got a proper look in the windows. Strange, alien looking people were sat on the train. Men with insect heads, a large hairy man who I was almost sure was bigfoot, reptilian creatures perched atop the seats. Every passenger looked like it clawed its way out of a 90s B-movie or a sci-fi novel. It was utterly bizarre, and I was gobsmacked by the sight. I was still processing all of this when the person in line behind me cleared his throat. Right, I was next in line.

 I stepped up and bought a few things, kind of mumbling, entirely    on autopilot as I tried to make sense of everything I’d just seen. With food in hand, I made my way to a bench and sat down. I ran through explanations in my head, and managed to convince myself that it was just me being paranoid. My imagination running wild. Surely those were just costumes, I managed to convince myself. I sat there for a while after that, just wrestling with my thoughts as the lights buzzed overhead. It was about thirty  minutes later, that I noticed a new sensation. I was being watched. I looked up and around, and realized that every single person remaining in the station was staring straight at me. The crowd and I stared at each other for what felt like ages, and I began to notice things about them I hadn’t before. Their faces and bodies were just..wrong. Facial features distorted or missing, limbs bending and twisting at odd angles. Completely wrong, but subtle enough that I had failed to notice in my distracted state. Eventually one of them pointed at the yellow warning sign on the wall, still staring at me wordlessly.  I began to panic, and fumbled for my phone to check the time. nine o’clock. Shit. I instantly leapt from my seat and began to make my way back towards the stairs. The last thing I needed was to get arrested for trespassing after dark.  Isn’t  that funny? All this creepy shit and the only thing I was worried about was getting arrested or fined. Guess my brain just hadn’t caught up with everything that was going on yet.

 As I hurried my way towards the exit I realized two things. One, was that the space I was in felt even more suffocating than before. The tunnels felt smaller, the lights brighter, it felt like the station itself was displeased with my being there. The second was that I had forgotten my map. My slight panic erupted into a full blown freakout then. The thought of going back to get it was unnerving, all those strange people were still there, but going on without it was an equally terrible idea. A rock and a hard place. Eventually I made up my mind, and turned around to go retrieve it. Before I could take a step though, I froze. There was someone else in the tunnel, a man I recognized from the boarding station. Seconds ticked by as we stared at each other, neither one making a peep. Eventually, the silence was broken as the man spoke. “Did you see the sign?” He said, completely monotone. “Uh..yeah, I was about to leave but I forgot my map, I hadn’t realized how late it was.” I replied, failing to mask my unease. He continued to stare for a moment, before speaking again. “Did you see the sign?” He repeated, in the same tone as last time. “Uh.. yeah man, I saw the sign..” I replied, once more. The man took  a step forward then, causing me to take one back. “Did you see the sign?” Same phrase, same monotone delivery. What the fuck was this guys problem?

 “Yes, I saw the fuckin' sign, I just need to get my map so I can get out of here.” I snapped, equal parts frustrated and freaked out by his weird behavior. He simply stared at me, completely unphased by my response. Then he took a quick step forward, then another, then another, and before I knew it  he  broke into a dead sprint towards me. I swore, and bolted in the opposite direction. Everything after that was a blur. Drab grey walls streaking by, overhead lamps blaring as I ran wildly through the subway tunnels. The entire time we were in chase, the man simply repeated that same phrase from before. “Did you see the sign?” I take a left. “Did you see the sign?” A right, then another right, then a left. “Did you see the sign?” I take another right. The only thing in my world at that moment was the sound of my panting, the thunder of footsteps echoing through the tunnel, and that goddamn phrase being repeated over and over again.

 Eventually  the man’s voice got quieter, more distant. I didn’t stop running though, not until I'd stopped hearing him entirely. Once I was sure that I was alone I collapsed against a wall, panting heavily in both exhaustion and relief. My lungs were on fire and my legs felt like jelly, but I was safe for now. Time passed slowly as I recovered, slumped against the wall with my heart beating out of my chest. Finally, I’d calmed down enough to take stock of my situation. The realization of how fucked I was now nearly sent me into another panic attack though. I was lost now, with no map, and on top of that my phone was dangerously low on battery with no service. The only things I had on me were a bottle of water and half a bag of skittles. I got to my feet, weighing my options before deciding on the only real course of action. I began to walk aimlessly through the tunnels, praying to find an exit.
