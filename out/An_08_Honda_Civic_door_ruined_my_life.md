I know, I know, it’s a strange combination of words that makes me sound crazy—no, more than crazy—like a lunatic, and right now you’re probably asking yourself how that’s even possible; but I promise you that I will try, to the best of my abilities, to explain how an eighth gen Civic door that I purchased from a scrapyard nearly made a divorcee of me, almost brought my life to a premature conclusion, and gave me a severe case of PTSD which plagues me to this day...

The story starts three years ago in a bungalow on the outskirts of Minneapolis during the height of the Covid pandemic, with me and my wife going through some harsh economic times. My wife had been laid off from her job, and I was working from the house remotely. During this time we never once left the home except to walk our five-year old Toy Poodle Luna around the yard to do her business, and everything was ordered in. We needed a replacement rear passenger side door for the old summer vehicle, a red, eighth gen Honda Civic, because ours was all rusted through. Looking to save a buck, I did what any other sane person would do—I called the local wrecking yard.

“Hey,” I asked the first person to pick up, “you wouldn’t happen to have a rear passenger side door for an 08 Honda Civic on hand, would you?”

"What color are you looking for?” the salesman asked gruffly.

“Red,” I responded politely.

“Let me check here on my computer for you…” Some thirty seconds went by before he said:

“You’re in luck. A red 08 Honda Civic just came in the other week from the impact auction with that door in mint condition. We’re asking two hundred for it.”

After haggling for a bit with the salesman on the price, he informed me that there u-pick yard was closed because of Covid, and that they would have to deliver the part to my doorstep. I gave the salesman my address, and the part was speedily delivered to my doorstep the very next day, much faster than I could’ve ever anticipated. I was extremely satisfied with the condition of the part, the service, the price, and the salesman, so I made sure to leave the wrecking yard a glowing review on google. I then spent the better part of an afternoon replacing the door on the car that we had now parked for the winter in our garage. At the time, I remember the door feeling a little bit heavier than the one I uninstalled and thinking that was odd, but I chalked it up to my imagination playing tricks on me.

Now unlike most horror stories, where a foreign object is introduced into a household and strange occurrences begin happening almost immediately, it took about one month before the strange occurrences began afflicting my household.

The first strange occurrence to afflict my household happened near the beginning of January. I was reading the morning newspaper while enjoying some pancakes drenched in table syrup and drinking a cup of coffee that my wife had prepared for breakfast, while she went out to check the mail. She came back with the mail in hand, but with consternation written all over her face. I should’ve been concerned, but what you need to understand is, my wife suffers from a severe case of OCD, so I never took any of her concerns seriously. She was always finding shit to obsess and nag me about. But, on the flipside of the coin, she was smoking hot, so I thought that was a small price to pay for someone that looked like her.

“What’s the matter,” I humored her, dropping my cup of morning Joe from my lips and affecting concern with raised eyebrows.

“Oh!” replied my wife somewhat dismissively. “It’s nothing really, just that I see some footprints in the snow—”

“Footprints in the snow!” I cried. “For Christ’s sake honey, we’ve got people delivering goods to our doorstep night and day! Of course there’s gonna be some footprints in the snow—"

“NO!” she cried petulantly, this time cutting me short. “You never let me finish! These aren’t just some delivery guy’s footprints. I followed them to see where they led, and they seem to wrap around the entirety of the house, like some thief scouting our place for the easiest point of entry.”

“Tell me,” I said patronizingly, “did the footprints end at the pine tree in our back yard and some yellow snow? Maybe the delivery guy needed to take a leak and decided to use our tree for privacy.”

“Why do you always have to be such an argumentative asshole about everything? For fuck’s sake, no! no! no! The footprints *did not* lead to the pine tree and there was no piss!”

“Okay I believe you,” I lied. “It’s just, you know how I get when people bother me when I’m eating. I only have a few bites left, and when those are finished I’ll come out to investigate.”

“Sure thing,” she replied submissively. My wife, however, wouldn’t let me finish the last few bites in peace. She sat down at the table, pretended to browse the web on her phone, and started tapping her fingers and feet impatiently while waiting for me to finish, doing everything in her power to make those last few bites as miserable an experience as possible. I muttered “fuck it” under my breath to express my displeasure, mopped up the remaining table syrup on my plate with the last few remaining bites of pancake, and wolfed it down in haste.

Once outside, she began leading me to the place where she thought she saw the prints. A storm cloud was passing overhead and it was snowing pretty heavily. At last, when we wrapped around the side of our house, I asked my wife where it was that she saw the prints.

“They’re gone!” she cried in surprise. “The snow’s covered them up!”

“Perhaps they never existed to begin with,” I said with a dismissive shrug of my shoulders.

“No!” my wife cried indignantly. “That’s not true at all and you know it! Had you come outside when I first told you about them, and not waited until you finished your breakfast and for a fucking blizzard to roll through, you would’ve seen them too!”

“Ok, I believe you,” I lied in attempt to defuse the situation. “But what do you want me to do about it? Call the police over some footprints in the snow? They’ll think I’m crazy!”

“I just want you to be on your guard is all and keep your eyes open from this day forth…”

There the conversation ended, and we went back inside; but this was just the first strange occurrence in a series of many more to come. That night I retired to bed, and must have been sleeping for a couple of hours, when my wife grabbed me by the shoulder and shrieked in my ear in mortal terror:

“Honey wake up! Wake up!”

“Jesus Christ!” I grumbled, opening one eye and glaring at her reproachfully. If there’s one thing I hate, more than being disturbed while eating a good meal, it’s being woken up prematurely from a good sleep. “What fucking time is it?”

“The time doesn’t matter! There’s a man clad in black standing just outside our garage and surveying the house! I think we should call the police!”

“Now let’s not do anything rash,” I said, slipping on my slippers. My wife grabbed me by the wrist and lead me towards the window. She was too terrified to look out the window again herself, and instead cowered behind the wall while looking at me expectantly, waiting to see my reaction.

“SEE? SEE?” she whispered while I scanned the entire front yard.

“Honey,” I said, my voice thick with concern. “There’s not a soul in sight…”

“Not a soul in sight?” she said in disbelief, finally mustering up the courage to look out the window again. “Why, there was a man standing there less than half a minute ago, staring right at me! Oh! you have to believe me!”

“It’s not that I don’t want to believe you, it’s that I can’t. There’s simply no one there. Honey, I’m worried about you… you’re sleep deprived and just need a good night’s rest is all,” I said, solicitously wrapping my arms around her and leading her back to bed.

The next night after that one, my sleep was interrupted not by my wife this time, but our dog Luna. My wife and I rushed out from our bedroom half-clad, and found her in the living room barking maniacally from our living room in the direction of the garage. My wife saw this as some sort of confirmation that her suspicions were correct, turned to me and cried:

“See? See? I’m not going crazy! Even Luna sees something!”

“Dogs bark at anything and everything,” I said dismissively, although my hair was standing on end and goosebumps had formed on my flesh. “It wouldn’t be the first time she’s woken us up in the middle of the night. It’s probably the winter wind that’s upsetting her. Come on, let’s go back to bed.”

The next morning I came out of the washroom feeling as buoyant as a cork after having taken my morning deuce, when I was ambushed in the hallway by my wife who was a much earlier riser than me.

“It’s January 12,” my wife said, “do you know what that means?”

“No,” I grumbled, “but I’m sure you’re going to tell me.”

“It means that our Christmas lights and tree have been up for way too long! All of our neighbors have already taken theirs down, and we’re the only ones with them still up!”

“Get off my ass!” I complained. “You know I had every intention of taking them down the other day, I was just busy with work. I’ll get to work on it this afternoon.”

When the afternoon came, I grabbed the ladder from the garage while muttering profanities under my breath, and got to work on taking down the lights. About halfway through my task, my neighbor, whom I will call George for the sake of confidentiality, pulled into his laneway for his lunchbreak, and got out of his Ford Escape. In neighborly fashion I waved at him, before asking him how everything on his side of the fence was going. I entertained his idle and pointless chatter about for about five minutes, before steering the conversation in the direction I wanted.

“Say George,” I began, “you haven’t seen anything…suspicious happening along our street as of late?”

“Suspicious?” asked George. “I guess it all depends on your definition of suspicious...”

“I don’t know, like people going up and down this road and into my yard that don’t belong here?”

“Hmm…” he mused thoughtfully, “no, I can’t say I have. The only thing I’ve seen is a bunch of delivery guys coming in and out of your driveway and that’s it. Why is everything alright? Should I be concerned?”

“Ah!” I said with a dismissive wave of my hand. “It’s nothing. Just my wife swears she’s been seeing a man trespassing on our property. Anyways, enjoy the rest of your day George!”

“You too, buddy. I’ll be sure to keep on eye open for you guys and let y’all know if I see anything out of place.

“And say, when this whole pandemic thing is over you need to come over for a barbeque and some beers like the good ole days.”

“Sure thing. I’d do just about anything to get away from my wife! I think I’m finally starting to get cabin fever after having been locked up with her for so long!”

“Ha! ha! I hear you on that! My wife has been driving me up the wall too!”

George and I shared a nice hearty laugh, and I went back inside after having taken down the last of the Christmas lights. The only thing remaining was the Christmas tree, which I threw at the end of our laneway for the Christmas tree collection.

The next morning, I sat down at the dinner table to eat some French toast and drink my freshly steaming cup of morning Joe, that my wife had just prepared for me.

“Huh,” I said, in between a sip of my coffee while reading the morning newspaper. “There’s been a lot of murders happening not far from here these past couple weeks. A home invasion in Brooklyn Park where a husband and wife were murdered in cold blood; and a man, driving a vehicle just like ours, was murdered in cold blood on a rural road outside of Bloomington… Even stranger, the cops think that these two seemingly disparate murders are related and committed by the same guy and that more might follow. Pretty crazy stuff, isn’t it?”

My wife, however, only feigned the slightest of interest and shrugged her shoulders despondently. I put the newspaper down, looked her in the eyes and said:

“Ok, I can sense something’s eating you alive. Get it off your chest, will you?”

“You,” my wife began, “said that the part you ordered came from a vehicle that came from an impact auction, didn’t you? My theory is that someone died in the vehicle the door came from, and their spirit attached itself to the door we now have, and the spirit will forever be unwilling to leave us alone until we return it back to the wrecking yard it came from.”

“What makes you so convinced that the door is possessed?” I laughed.

“The footsteps, the appearance of the man, Luna barking throughout the night, everything that I’ve seen, seems to be concentrated around the garage, where the door you just brought into this house is.”

“Let’s say that you’re right,” I humored her, “and that the door is demonically possessed as you so eloquently put it… Why would the spirit wait one month after arriving at our house before making its presence known?”

“I don’t know the specifics,” she cried irritably, raising her voice, “and I’m not an expert on paranormal activity! All I know is, our life won’t return to normal until we get rid of that door for good!”

I knew that my wife would forever be unwilling to relent on the issue. She would nag and nag and nag until I finally conceded defeat and agreed to take the door back to where it came from. Only, I was unwilling to concede defeat on something so stupid, and little did she know that I was holding an ace up my sleeve that I was hoping would end discussion on this matter forever.

“Do you hear how ridiculous you sound? This isn’t the fucking *Conjuring*! Life isn’t a movie! Ghosts don’t exist! And if they did, they sure as shit don’t attach themselves to inanimate objects despite what Hollywood wants you to believe!

“And besides, I talked with George the other day to see if he’s seen anything suspicious happening in the neighborhood as of late, and you know what he had to say?”

“What?”

“That he hasn’t seen a fucking thing! It’s all a figment of your imagination, honey, and I’m really worried about you…”

“George is a stupid, sodden drunk with a below room-temp IQ!” my wife cried. “What-in-the-actual fuck! would he know about anything?”

“Don’t you talk about George like that!” I defended angrily. “He’s a kind-hearted family man! You take that back!”

“Fuck George and fuck you too! You’re a misogynistic pig, and I regret having gave you the last five years of my life!”

She then stormed out of the kitchen, giving me the much-desired solitude I needed to enjoy my French Toast and cup of morning Joe.

The next morning, as I was eating a plate of bacon and eggs that my wife prepared for me, sunny side up just the way I like them, I heard a van pulling up to our house. I then heard a thud at the front door, and heard the same vehicle driving off. My wife opened the door, picked up a package and came back inside with a smug look on her face.

“What’s that?” I asked through a mouthful of food, and taking a swig of morning Joe to wash it down quickly. “I don’t remember having ordered anything from Amazon.”

“This,” said my wife, ripping open the package and tearing out its contents. “Is ghost-hunting equipment, and I’m going to use it to prove a point.”

“Ghost-hunting equipment!” I laughed. “You’ve lost your mind! How much did that cost? Ten bucks?”

“One-hundred dollars—”

“One-hundred dollars!” I cried, spitting out a half-masticated bite of bacon and eggs I was thoroughly enjoying, my laughter giving way to rage. “We’re up to our eyeballs in debt, and you thought it would be a good idea to piss away one-hundred dollars on fucking ghost-hunting equipment? My god! I’m trying my best not to lose my cool, but you are making that extremely difficult on me right now. You need to repackage that shit right now and get a return on it while there’s still time!”

“Just hear me out!” my wife pleaded.

“Just this one last time; but I warn you, you’re walking a very thin line…”

“Okay,” my wife said, taking a deep breath before giving me an ultimatum. “Just let me set up this device, and use it on the door. If it comes back with a positive signature, you agree to send the door back to the scrapyard. If, on the other hand, it somehow comes back with nothing, I promise not to say another word about the door ever again, come what may, and I’ll get to work on sending the device back immediately.”

Seeing as I was wholeheartedly convinced that the door was not demonically possessed and that I was in the right, I readily agreed to the proposal. Five minutes later found us in the garage, gathered around the door in anticipation. My wife, with trembling hands, raised the ghost-detector and pressed the on switch—and alas! the signal we were met with was a negative one. My wife was evidently deflated and defeated, but I of course felt nothing but jubilation.

“See?” I gloated in triumph. “It’s nothing more than a figment of your imagination! Now get to work on repacking that stupid thing and sending it back so we can recoup our money while there’s still time.”

Without a word, and with head downcast, my wife returned to the living room and got to work on repackaging the detector…

I thought my wife would be a woman of her word and never bring the topic up again, but boy was I ever wrong. Our life returned to normal for nothing more than the span of eight hours, before she reopened the discussion on the door over dinner that she prepared.

“I just can’t shake the feeling that we’re being watched—” she said, her eyes wet with tears, showing the first signs of a nervous breakdown.

“For Christ’s sake!” I cried, slamming my fork and knife down on the dinner plate. “I thought we were off of this topic!”

“Just hear me out!” my wife pleaded. “Maybe the door isn’t demonically possessed like I initially thought, but that doesn’t mean that someone, a real person, might not be after the door.”

“Do you hear how crazy you sound right now? What could anyone want with an old Civic door? It’s a fucking door!”

“You said the wrecking yard got the vehicle from an impact auction, didn’t you? Maybe the owner of the vehicle had some sort of sentimental attachment to the door, and won’t stop until they get the door back—"

“Sentimental attachment to a door?” I cried in disbelief, cutting her short. “That might be the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard! We’ve already been over this! I talked to George and not a soul has seen anything suspicious happening on this road other than you. No more, I’m done. You’ve lost your mind. I refuse to talk to you about this ever again.”—I stormed off, leaving the rest of my dinner untouched.

That night my wife and I went to sleep on opposite sides of the bed, and when I woke the next morning it was without the familiar scent of breakfast and coffee assailing my nostrils. I found my wife at the front door, fully dressed with her winter boots on and with Luna standing at her side.

“You taking the dog outside to do her business?” I asked while yawning and scratching my head. “And say, where’s breakfast at?”

“I’m done,” my wife sniffled laconically while zipping-up her coat and turning her back to me.

“What do you mean you’re done?” I asked innocently, but narrowing my eyes suspiciously. “Done with staying put in the house?”

“I’m done with *us* you fucking halfwit!” she snapped while sobbing and turning back around to face me. “ I can’t do this anymore! Until you admit that there’s a serious problem facing this household, and that there’s something or someone stalking the house, I’m done with *us* and never coming back. I’ve booked myself a room in a hotel for the next week. You have precisely seven days to sort this shit out, at the end of which time I’ll be seeing a divorce lawyer. Goodbye.”

“You know,” I spat, seething with anger, “that’s just fucking like you! Threatening me with divorce over another one of your goddamn hallucinations! And now you’re wasting money we don’t have on a hotel room? My god! Whatever, I’m past the point of caring; walk you fucking headcase! But you ain’t taking Luna with you, I’ll tell you that right fucking now. Luna! Come here girl!”

Luna was just about to run over to me when my wife scooped her up in her arms and darted out of the house. I chased the two out of the door, following hot on their heels, but my wife had too much of a jump on me and had already prepared her escape. She had the Chevy Equinox already warmed up and the snow scraped off the front and back windshields. She jumped in the vehicle and quickly locked the doors behind her.

“Give her back!” I screamed like a maniac, running alongside the vehicle and slapping viciously on window while she sped off. “You fucking bitch! Give her back now!”

But it was no use. She reached the road and sped off, while some of the neighbors came out to watch me freaking out in my morning robe and slippers like an idiot. Embarrassed, I hastened back inside as quick as I could and slammed the door behind me. I went to the fridge, threw the door open angrily, grabbed some beer, threw on the tv and then put in an order for extra large meat lover’s pizza, just the way I like it, that was to arrive within an hour. About eight beers deep, the pizza had not come, and I couldn’t resist the urge to doze off…

I was woken up by the sound of my phone ringing and vibrating like a motherfucker. It was now dark outside, and the tv I was watching had turned off automatically. “Just how long was I out for?” I pondered. I managed to pick up my phone a second before it went to voicemail, and to my great displeasure, it was my wife’s Karen-like voice on the other end.

“Honey!” she screamed in a panic. “You need to get out of the house, now!”

“Why?” I drawled drunkenly, rising to my feet and looking over my shoulders in a panic. “Is the house burning down or something?”

“No! the house isn’t burning down but your life is in grave danger! I’m on my way back as we speak, but you need to get out of the house, now, before it’s too late! There’s something inside of the door, something that someone’s after. It’s the reason why the man in Bloomington and the couple in Brooklyn Park were murdered and your life is in jeopardy—"

There was a knock on the door.

A couple seconds later the doorbell wrung.

“Hang on,” I interrupted, “there’s someone knocking on the door… It’s probably the pizza guy; I’ll call you back in a moment—”

“DON’T ANSWER IT!” she tried warning me. “WHATEVER YOU DO DON’T ANSWER THAT DOOR—” but I hung up. What can I say? I was wasted beyond belief and had no idea how much danger I was in, despite my wife’s warnings. Without so much as a second thought, I drunkenly stumbled to the door and threw it wide open, only to see nothing but empty space before me, no car in the laneway, just the pizza that I had ordered hours before with the receipt stapled to the box and that had unceremoniously been thrown on the ground.

“How strange!” I drawled drunkenly. “The pizzaman didn’t even wait for me to tip him before taking off. My god! am I ever hungry…” I stooped down to pick up my pizza and the next thing I knew a blunt instrument was crashing down on the top of my skull. Everything faded to black…

When I woke, I was conscious of the fact that my hands and feet were bound, that I was seated on a wooden chair, and that there was a sock stuffed in my mouth. Everything was a red haze because of the blood running in a current down my face from where I was struck and pooling in my eyes. A man within arm’s reach, clad all in black and wearing a face mask, was working on putting the trim panel of the rear passenger-side Civic door back in place. I shut my eyes and reopened them. No, this wasn’t a dream; there really was a man putting the trim panel on the door back into place. Naturally and automatically, I began struggling against my bindings. When he became aware that I had regained consciousness, he looked back at me and said:

“Ah! you’re awake! I’m so glad you can finally join me! If you promise not to scream like a woman and wake up the whole neighborhood, I’ll be so kind as to remove that sock from your mouth; can you do that for me?”

I nodded my assent, wide-eyed with terror, and the man removed the sock from my mouth. The first words that escaped my trembling lips were:

“What—ah! my fucking head is splitting—the hell is going on here!”

The villain went on to humor my request and explain everything.

“What’s going on,” he began, while going about his task at the same time, “is you happened to be in possession of something of mine; something extremely valuable. Here, take a look at this—” he threw a bundle in my lap that must have weighed at least 10 pounds.

“What am I looking at?”

“What you’re looking at is a bundle of fentanyl pills worth around one-quarter of a million dollars, and that was hidden inside of the door you purchased from the wrecking yard. While you spent the last five minutes regaining your consciousness after I pistol whipped you, I spent that time dismantling the door you purchased to recover my product.

“I get it, I get it, you’re confused, and rightfully so; I would be too if I was in your shoes. But here, let me explain:

“Back in November of last year, I was running some fentanyl that I manufactured from America into Canada, when the Honda I was driving, the same model and color as yours, hit a patch of black ice before I even made it to the border. I veered off the road going around eighty miles per hour, and went head on with a tree. The accident fucked me up bad, and the next thing I knew I was waking up in the ICU two weeks later, not knowing what the hell had happened. Fortunately, my wife was by my bedside to fill in the gap in my memory.

“The first thing I needed to do was track the movement of my vehicle. I asked my wife in a panic what happened to our vehicle, and she, who I keep in the dark about my line of work—the innocent soul still thinks I make my fortune through crypto—informed me that the vehicle was fucked up beyond repair, that she was left with no other choice but to write it off, and that it ended up in an impact auction. The first thing I did after recovering from my injuries was to call the impact auction and ask them what happened to my vehicle. They were kind enough to inform me the exact wrecking yard that it had been sold to. Simple enough, I foolishly thought. All that needs to be done is to purchase all four doors from the wrecking yard, and I would once more be in possession of the million dollars’ worth of product I had lost. If only things had been that simple…

“I drove to the wrecking yard only to discover, to my horror, that all four doors had been sold to who-the-fuck knows where, and that’s when the panic began to set in. Before leaving, I asked the sales-desk if they knew where those doors went. They gave me a strange look for asking such a weirdly pointed question, said that they had no clue and that even if they did, they were legally obligated to protect customer information.

“I had no choice but to break into their office later that night after closing, and access that information myself on their computers. After some digging, I was able to find the addresses I was looking for easily enough, and went on my way.

“Fortunately, unlike you, the front driver’s side door I was after, was on a Civic that was a couple’s daily driver, and they left their vehicle parked in their laneway; meaning, I could go about my work during the night with everyone being none the wiser—or so I thought.

“I’m sure you heard about the double homicide home invasion that happened two weeks ago in Brooklyn Park? Yeah, that was me. What was supposed to be a simple in-and-out job, quickly became an unmitigated disaster. I broke into the vehicle without tripping the alarm, and just as I finished retrieving my product and putting the trim panel back on the door and popping the window switch into place, the porch light turned on. The next thing I knew I found myself involved in a shootout. I managed to emerge victorious, only taking a grazing bullet to my shoulder while shooting my opponent in the head. I then went into the house to stage the whole thing to look like a home invasion. I killed his wife in cold blood, ruffled some things around in haste, made off with my product, and the police never suspected a thing.

“The front passenger’s side door that I was after was in Bloomington, and this time it belonged to a single man in his early thirties, and fortunately his Civic was his daily driver as well. I was unwilling to make the same mistake I made last time in attempting to get the goods out in the open in someone’s laneway, so this time I stalked this man’s daily movements. I tailed him going down a deserted stretch of rural road on his one-hour commute to a construction site outside of the city, and fender-bendered him. I got him to pull over under the pretense of exchanging insurance information. That’s when I popped him in the head and made off with my second parcel of goods.

“Now only two more bundles remained, and one of them you were in unwitting possession of. I rented an Air B&B not far from here and spent the last week casing your place out. When I discovered that your vehicle was parked for the winter, I realized I had a real problem on my hands. I then waited and waited and waited for the right moment to go in and pluck the goods when you and your wife were away from the house. The goal was to go about this as discreetly and with as little bloodshed as possible, but unfortunately you two made that an impossible task for me. All I needed was a fifteen-minute window to break into your house and do what needed doing, but alas! the window of opportunity never came. You and your wife refused to leave the house for an entire week, and that dog of yours, that Cerberus, kept giving away my movements every time I tried forcing an entry during the night. I only have so much patience and a life I need to return to, and you two left me with no other choice than to go about this the direct way.

“When I saw your wife storming off from the house in a huff with your dog and her bags packed earlier today, I was able to deduce that you two had a falling out and all I had to contend with was you and that my moment arrived at last. I waited until it got dark, and then pounced on my opportunity.

“Well, that brings us up to the present,” he said, popping the window switch back into place, packing his tools up, and pocketing the parcel of drugs, “and that concludes my work here. Ha! I’ve become more proficient in the art of removing trim panels than I ever thought I would need to be! After tonight, I have only one more package to reclaim and then I can finally put this disaster to bed, although that one happens to be in another state entirely…”

“So that’s why the door felt so heavy when I was putting it on,” I said, shaking my head in disbelief. “But why not just show up at my door and make me an offer for the door I couldn’t refuse? I would’ve been willing to give you the door for anything you were willing to offer!”

“I thought about doing just that,” the villain said, nodding his head in agreement, “when I saw that you and your wife wouldn’t budge from the house, but I couldn’t take the risk. On paper you might say that you would’ve been willing to take whatever I offered for it, and then there was always the chance that you would get curious, tell me to go fuck myself, and check what was inside of the door yourself. Then you might’ve called the cops, who would’ve traced the door back to the wrecking yard and back to me, and I would be looking at blowing out my birthday candles in a cell for the rest of my life. No, as I said before, this was something that needed to be done as discreetly as possibly, with no one none the wiser.

“But, as I’ve already said, my work here is concluded, and I’ve told you too much. I’ll have to stage this to look like nothing more than a regular-old home invasion. You better start saying your Hail Marys...”

The villain reached into his coat jacket, produced a silenced pistol and pointed it at my forehead.

I closed my eyes in fear and fought ferociously against my bonds while whimpering like a baby:

“NO, PLEASE! You don’t have to do this! I won’t tell a soul about what happened here tonight! I promise!”

“Ha! ha! look at the piss running down your leg!” he laughed hysterically (just for the record, and sorry for barging in here and ruining the pacing of the story at such a climactic moment, I never pissed myself; he just made that up to humiliate me further and to indulge his twisted sense of humor, and I left what he said in the story for the sake of transparency…) “It never ceases to amaze me just how much you sheep fear the grim reaper and cling onto life! I promise you, death isn’t so terrifying when you think about it; nothing more than everlasting sleep is all. Goodbye friend—”

At this point I heard a gunshot, my head retreated into my chest like a tortoise’s head retreating into its shell, and my ears were ringing like a bitch. I was fully convinced that I had just been shot and that my time here on earth had been cut short. I refused to open my eyes and thought to myself *so this really is what death feels like...eternal darkness, just like the villain said.* But just as the thought passed through my head, I heard something metallic clatter on the ground, and felt the rope binding my hands behind my back being frantically sawed through.

I opened my eyes, surveyed the scene in front of me, and immediately understood what had happened. The villain was lying in a puddle of his own blood on the garage floor, and his brains were splattered all over the wall to my right. The thing that I heard clatter on the pavement was the handgun my wife always carried on her person, and the one she must've just used to save my life. My wife finished sawing the ropes that bound my hands, and began working on the ones that bound my feet.

“Are you okay?” my wife looked up at me solicitously while hugging my leg (would she have been hugging my leg if I had pissed myself like the villain said? No? that’s what I thought), with tears running down her cheeks. “Are you okay?”—she repeated.

“You came back for me!” I cried in disbelief. “How? And why?”

“When I stormed off today, I booked a room at the nearest dog-friendly hotel fifteen minutes away. I spent the day sobbing, eating ice cream and binge-watching Sherlock Holmes, the one we usually watch together, to try and console myself. Around an hour before I called you, an episode called “the Six Thatchers” came on.

“The episode is an interesting one, where a criminal smashes busts of Margaret Thatcher trying to find a memory stick he hid inside of one many years before. While watching the episode, I saw a number of things that paralleled our situation and it was then when I was finally able to put two and two together.

“I remembered the conversation we had at the dinner table, the one about the man dying outside of Bloomington, and how he happened to drive a vehicle like ours, and the couple who were murdered in Brooklyn Park, and how the police thought the murders were related, and that’s when the light bulb went off over my head.

“‘Holy shit!’ I cried, ‘Maybe, just maybe, the problem wasn’t with the door like I originally thought, but what’s inside of the door! My god I have to call him right now!’

“I reached for my phone and called you without a moment’s hesitation. My first call went to voicemail, so I hung up and tried and again, beginning to fear the worst. This time you picked up a second before the phone was going to send me to voicemail, and that’s when I tried warning you.

“You, however, being the stubborn fool that you are, hung up on me while telling me that someone was knocking on the door, and I knew that something was seriously wrong. I called the police, and they told me they wouldn’t be able to send help for at least another hour. That’s when I sped off from the hotel, breaking every traffic law on my way over to save your life.

“The criminal left the front door unlocked, so I was able to sneak into the house undetected. As I crept to the garage, all my nerves were on edge and my hands were shaking as I gripped the handgun I always carry in my purse. Oh, honey! when I saw you bound there with a gun pressed to your forehead, I was so terrified, but I knew what had to be done. I didn’t hesitate to pull the trigger.

“And what do you mean by ‘why’? Despite everything that happened this past week, I still love you, and that’s reason enough. Everything’s going to be okay. The police will be here any minute now.”

“You were right about everything!” I sobbed pathetically, finally coming to the realization that I had the most selfless, solicitous, intelligent, and loving wife on the planet. “I don’t deserve you at all…”
