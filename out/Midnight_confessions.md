As a late-night radio host, I was no stranger to bizarre calls. My show, “Midnight Confessions,” attracted all sorts of listeners, from lonely souls seeking companionship to the truly disturbed. But one particular night, I received a call that would haunt me forever.

It started like any other evening. I was in the studio, sipping lukewarm coffee and chatting with a caller about their ghostly encounters when the phone lines lit up. The caller ID displayed a number I didn’t recognize. I hesitated, feeling an inexplicable chill run down my spine, but then I answered.

“Welcome to Midnight Confessions! You’re on the air. What’s your confession?”

There was silence on the other end, a heavy pause that felt too long. Then a low, gravelly voice finally broke through. “I’ve done terrible things.”

I felt a rush of adrenaline, intrigued yet uneasy. “What do you mean? You can share with us; this is a safe space.”

He chuckled softly, but it wasn’t a laugh of amusement. “Safe? That’s cute. You have no idea what I’ve done.”

My heart raced as he spoke. He described in chilling detail the lives he’d taken, the thrill of the hunt, the way their fear electrified him. I was gripped by horror, my mind racing as I realized I was speaking to a killer.

“Do you want to know how it feels?” he asked, his voice low and almost hypnotic. “To have someone completely at your mercy? It’s a rush.”

I tried to keep my composure. “Why are you telling me this? Why now?”

“Because, my dear host,” he replied, “you’re the only one who’s listened.”

I glanced at the clock; it was past midnight, the hour when the shadows seemed to grow long. “What do you mean? Surely you’ve told someone before?”

“Every time I call, they hang up. You’re different. You engage.”

I felt a shiver race down my spine. “Where are you calling from?”

“Does it matter?” he said, his tone dripping with amusement. “What matters is what comes next.”

“What comes next?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

“Another confession,” he said. “But this time, it’s personal.”

Just then, the studio lights flickered. I looked around, suddenly aware of how alone I was in that dimly lit room. “What do you mean by personal?”

“Do you have a picture of yourself? I’d love to see what my host looks like.”

My stomach dropped. “Why would you want that?”

“Because I’m coming for you,” he said, his voice dropping to a deadly whisper. “And I want to know what I’m going to take.”

Panic surged through me. “You’re just a voice on the phone. You can’t do anything!”

“Oh, but I can,” he said with a sickening calm. “And I will. You’ll hear me before you see me.”

I glanced at the studio door, half-expecting it to swing open. “Stay away from me! I’m calling the police!”

“Go ahead,” he taunted. “But they won’t get here in time. You’ll see.”

With that, the line went dead. I sat in stunned silence, my mind racing. I quickly dialed the police, my hands trembling. I told them everything, my heart pounding in my chest as I waited for them to arrive.

Fifteen minutes later, the police showed up. They searched the studio and surrounding area but found nothing. No signs of anyone lurking, no clues left behind.

“Maybe it was a prank,” one officer suggested, though his tone lacked conviction.

I shook my head. “No, this felt real. He knew things.”

As I started to gather my things, I noticed my phone had a new message. I opened it, only to find a photo attached. My blood ran cold.

It was a picture of me, taken from outside the studio, the dark silhouette of a figure barely visible in the background.

The message read: “I’m closer than you think.”

I don’t do late-night radio anymore. They say you should face your fears, but some things are better left in the dark.
