# The Little Susy.

# 

# Prologue: Knowing the Unknown.

What lies beyond life? Do our souls really go somewhere when our bodies die? Do we reincarnate into some kind of animal? Do we become part of the stars in the vast cosmos? Or is it just the end of everything? Hmm, whichever the answer may be... it's equally terrifying.

(A voice in the darkness of an unknown individual says:)

* Unknown:
* Lately, I've been having the same dream every night...
* It's dark, I can't see anything, absolutely nothing, not even the horizon...
* There's no noise, I can only hear the faint sound of emptiness...
* I'm alone, I always find myself alone...
* I scream, but no one comes...
* I walk, run, flee, but I don't feel like I'm making progress and I find myself stuck...
* I don't remember the last time I had a nice dream or dreamed about anything else.
* I'm tired of this, you know?
* Sometimes I wake up and wonder if I really was dreaming or just forgot that I was.
* This depresses me much more than I already was, much more.
* But...
* Tonight is different...
* It feels different...
* Because you're here with me.

...

(An uncomfortable silence is present... But, someone else in the darkness seems to be watching)

# Chapter 1: Meeting Susy.

# 

(In a pink room, on top of a small pink dresser with two white drawers, placed next to a family photo, an old bell clock starts ringing next to a bed. A girl wakes up excitedly and quickly turns off the alarm. This girl gets out of bed and says:)

* "Today begins a new and wonderful day! Oh, hello! My name is 'Little Susy,' but you can just call me 'Susy.' Like every day, I get out of bed, brush my teeth, take a hot bath, put on my favorite dress, and go down to the kitchen to have breakfast with my beautiful family."

(Susy runs downstairs to meet her family, who are waiting for her at the dining table with breakfast served. She sits on one of the five chairs around the table and says:)

* "They are my family; Mom, Dad, and my older brother named Adam. Like every morning, Mom cooks 'toast with eggs and bacon.'"

(Susy tries the food and says:)

* Susy:
* "Your toast is delicious, Mom!"

(And her mother responds:)

* Mom:
* "Thank you, daughter! I made it especially for my little girl!"

(And everyone at the table starts laughing. "Susy seems happy")

(After breakfast, Susy grabs her backpack and gets ready to go to school, she tells us:)

* "When we have to go to school, Dad takes Adam and me in his truck before going to work, while Mom gives us lunch and a big hug."

(Susy and her brother leave home and get into their father's vehicle, he starts the truck, puts it in gear, and takes them to school).

(as the transportation is on the move, Susy introduces us to the city a little)

* "Welcome to the wonderful world of 'NOTHING-HERE'! our little piece of safe zone isolated from the outside, located in the middle of nowhere itself! perfect for all those people who want to live quietly and who everyone has already forgotten, where you never know if it's day, night, evening, or morning! and also!, its inhabitants are the kindest and most supportive there are!"

(Upon arriving at their destination, the kids get off the truck and Susy says:)

* "Aah, school, I love this place. When Dad drops us off at school, he always says something like:
* Dad:
* "Goodbye kids, have a good day at school!"
* And we say:
* Susy and Adam:
* "Goodbye Dad, have a good day at work too!"
* And then he goes to work.
* At school, Adam and I split up since we have classes in different classrooms.
* Susy:
* "See you at recess, Adam!"

(Says Susy, Adam raises his hand and says goodbye to her)

* Adam:
* "See you later, Susy!"

(Susy continues alone and stands right at the door of her classroom)

* Before entering the classroom, I like to greet my teacher and classmates.
* Susy:
* "Hello, good morning everyone!"

(Says Susy, and everyone in the classroom raises their hand and greets her)

* Everyone in the class:
* "Hi Susy, good morning!"
* In the classroom, the teacher asks me questions about any topic, and as always, I answer correctly, and everyone congratulates me for it.

(Everyone in the class applauds and congratulates Susy. "Susy seems happy")

* "It's already recess time! I meet Adam and we go play in the schoolyard. After playing for a while, we go to some benches to eat the lunches that Mom prepared."
* Susy:
* "Oh, tuna and egg sandwich! My favorite!"

(Says Susy, and both children eat their lunches and laugh)

* After recess, Adam and I go back to our classrooms and finish our classes. When classes are over, we leave and wait for Dad outside the school. Dad never takes too long to arrive. Oh! There he comes, right on time!

(The kids get into their father's vehicle and all go home)

* When we get home, Adam and I do our homework while Mom and Dad tidy up and clean the house. When we all finish, we sit at the dining table to have dinner, "spaghetti with meatballs."
* Susy:
* "Mmm! This is very delicious, Mom!"

(Says Susy, and everyone starts laughing).

* After dinner, we all sit together in the living room to watch a movie: "Hope in Times of Solitude," my favorite movie.

(The whole family is sitting on the sofa watching TV. "Susy seems to be happy")

* "And that's not all! On weekends, Mom, Dad, Adam, and I go early to the park for a picnic. After eating, we lie on the ground to watch the clouds, that's my favorite pastime."
* "The next day, we all go to church to praise our Lord. Everyone in the church is very nice!"
* "Oh! We also go to the neighborhood pool, I like to swim there."
* "When we're on our way home, I like to greet everyone in the neighborhood, especially the neighbors next door, as they are a very tender elderly couple, they also have a very cute dog!"
* "And to finish, my family and I sit in the living room to play some board games."
* Susy:
* "Ah! I won!"

(Says Susy, and everyone laughs).

* After a busy week, it's time to go to bed. Adam and I go to the bathroom to brush our teeth one last time. After that, Adam goes to sleep and Mom and Dad accompany me to my room.
* When I'm in bed, Mom and Dad sing me a song and give me their goodnight kisses, then they turn off the lights and go to sleep. Then I fall asleep and the next day starts all over again.

What else could I want? My life is perfect as it is. I live an eternal cycle full of happiness.

...

* Well...
* There's only one thing that has me a little worried...
* I used to have a friend...
* He was a bit shy and quiet, but he was also kind, gentle, and had a great imagination!
* Yes, he was a good boy...
* It's been a long time since I've seen him and I would like to see him again... I miss him a lot.
* ...
* Oh! I'm sorry, I think I got a little sentimental.
* Well, I've already talked too much about my life.

(Susy curls up in her bed and says:)

* Susy:
* "Tomorrow will be just as great!"

(Susy closes her eyes very slowly and falls asleep)

(…)

(Susy has a dream, In this dream, the environment is very dark, there is nothing around)

(Except for something big, which is perched in the background, about 20 meters away, it cannot be distinguished what it is...)

(Susy seems confused by the situation she is in, and says:)

* Susy:
* "Hello? Is anyone there? Where am I?"

(But no one answers...)

(So Susy takes a deep breath and starts taking small steps very cautiously to gradually approach the strange object)

(When she is at a considerable distance, Susy realizes what it is. It seems to be some kind of wardrobe, the size of an average person, it has some design details, it has a lock and knob on one of its two doors, the key is missing and it seems to be locked)

(And then, when she is standing right in front of the wardrobe, she begins to experience a strong chill running through her body, but even though she is afraid, she gathers courage, and slowly brings her head closer to the door. She puts her ear to the door, to listen for any sound coming from inside the wardrobe)

(…)

(But she fails to hear anything, so she knocks on the door 3 times)

(Knock, knock, knock.)

(…)

(A familiar voice asks)

* Unknown:
* "Who is it?... Susy?"

(Susy suddenly wakes up, she is in her bed, the clock is ringing like crazy, it seems that it has been ringing for a while now, so she reaches out to turn it off, and in doing so, she realizes that her hand is sweaty, not only her hands, but her whole body is soaked in sweat)

(It seems to be daytime already, it smells like toasted bread and sounds like something is frying, but Susy is still a little uneasy and wonders what that strange dream could mean)

(Mom calls from the door:)

* Mom:
* "Susy, it's time to get up, your breakfast will get cold!"
* Susy:
* "Okay, Mom, I'll be down in a minute!"

(Susy gets out of bed and tells herself:)

* But that dream doesn't matter now, because today is "Today begins a new and wonderful day!"

(Susy starts her day as usual, goes to the bathroom to brush and groom herself, dresses in her dress, has breakfast with her family, and then grabs her backpack and goes to school with Adam in their father's truck. After classes, at recess she meets Adam to eat together. Already sitting on the benches, they open their lunchboxes and take out their lunches)

* Susy:
* "Tuna and egg sandwich! As always, it's my favorite."

(While both kids eat, Adam asks Susy:)

* Adam:
* "Hey Susy, haven't you felt something strange lately?"

(Susy looks at him and replies:)

* Susy:
* "Something strange? No, like what?"

(Adam looks down and says:)

* Adam:
* "I don't know, it's just that lately, I feel like we're doing the same thing every day."

(Susy looks at him strangely and asks:)

* Susy:
* "The same thing every day? What's wrong with that?"

(Adam looks surprised and asks her:)

* Adam:
* "Doesn't that bother you even a little? Wouldn't you like to do something different?"

(Susy closes her eyes and starts savoring her food while tapping her feet)

* Susy:
* "No, as long as I keep eating this delicious sandwich!"
* Adam:
* "But..."

(Susy gets a little angry and tells him:)

* Susy:
* "Different is bad, Adam, so just shut up and keep eating."

(Adam lowers his head and continues eating)

(At the end of the school day, their father comes to pick them up to take them home, the kids get into the vehicle, and their dad asks them:)

* Dad:
* "Hi kids! How was school, good?"

(Susy responds affirmatively, but Adam seems distant)

(When they arrive home, the kids take off their shoes and sit on the living room carpet, open their backpacks, take out their books, and start studying. Susy is excitedly doing her homework, but Adam gets agitated and tells his sister:)

* Adam:
* "See, this is what I'm talking about!"
* Susy:
* "What's wrong?"
* Adam:
* "Homework is the same as last week."
* Adam:
* "I had already done it, but it's empty, as if everything had reset."
* Susy:
* "Don't be silly, Adam, what are you talking about?"
* Adam:
* "I'm just saying that I think something weird is happening, like everything is repeating over and over."
* Susy:
* "Stop it with that again, just please stop, you're scaring me."

(While the kids have this little argument, behind them, the adults prepare dinner in the kitchen and everything seems calm. but then... a loud noise is heard, something has broken, it seems that one of the two windows in the front of the room has broken, the kids approach to see what happened, and in the middle of the broken glass in a black puddle on the floor, there is a strange creature writhing and fluttering erratically, it seems to be a crow, it is black and has feathers like one. but it's unknown if this creature is a crow, as the impact against the window has left it as a deformed mass)

(Adam and Susy approach the strange animal to get a better look, and they wonder:)

* Susy:
* "What strange thing is this?"
* Adam:
* "It looks like a bird, but... Where is its head?"

(And Susy scolds Adam:)

* Susy:
* "I don't like this! We should end its suffering."
* Adam:
* "What? What do you mean?"

(The children's parents rush to the scene and say:)

* Dad:
* "Heavens, kids!, Are you okay!?"
* Mom:
* "My God!, Kids, stay away from 'that', you can cut yourselves with the glass!"

(The parents crouch down, hug their children as tightly as they can, and wonder:)

* Dad:
* "What is that thing?"
* Mom:
* "Where does that animal come from

?"

(Susy raises her hand, points forward, and says:)

* Susy:
* "There, it came in through the window."

(The whole family is together huddled on the floor looking towards the window, and they realize that it is very dark. The darkness that lies outside is disconcerting, overwhelming, and terrifying, like a black hole that swallowed up all traces of light, as if night had swallowed the entire world, it seems that nothing exists outside the house.)

* Dad:
* "Kids, I think it's time to sleep, he he."

(The father says nervously:)

* Mom:
* "Come on, kids, tonight we'll all sleep together in mom and dad's room."
* Susy:
* "And what about dinner?"
* Dad:
* "Come on, Susy, listen to your mother, we'll have dinner tomorrow."

(Everyone gets up from the floor, and dad covers the 'thing' with a sheet, closes all the curtains of all the windows, the children and their mother go up to the room to take refuge from the night. What's happening? Everyone wonders in their minds while lying in bed trying to sleep)

(The night passes and everyone falls asleep, especially Susy, who ends up having another strange dream. In this dream, the wardrobe makes an appearance again. Susy is standing in front of the imposing object, she raises her hand to touch the door, but before doing so, the voice inside the wardrobe interrupts her, saying:)

* Unknown:
* "Susy... it's you, isn't it?"
* Susy:
* "Who are you? Why are you inside the wardrobe?"
* Unknown:
* "Don't you remember me? Typical of you. Always forgetting everything."
* Susy:
* "Do we know each other?"
* Unknown:
* "We never had the pleasure. Why don't you open the door and we introduce ourselves?"
* Susy:
* "Huh? I don't know, should I? Are you a good person?"
* Unknown:
* "…
* A good person? Ha ha ha, and are you?"

Susy wakes up, she's in her bed, again she's sweating.
