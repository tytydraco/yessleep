The air was thick and restless, buzzing with the energy of a crowded market that never seemed to sleep. Vendors shouted their prices like their lives depended on it, their voices crashing against each other in a relentless war for attention. The air stank of fried snacks and overripe fruits slowly rotting under the scorching sun, their sweetness curdling into something putrid.

Stalls were packed so tight you had to squeeze through, colors bleeding into one another—bright oranges, blood-red apples, heaps of green chilies dripping with water droplets to fake freshness. The world was both vibrant and filthy, a beautiful mess that left you feeling like you needed a shower just from breathing.

People swarmed like ants, shoving and stumbling over uneven ground littered with plastic wrappers and trampled leaves. Dust clung to the back of my throat, gritty and thick.

My friend and I pushed through the chaos, trying to make conversation over the market’s roar. She was rambling about her coaching, about the constant drama that seemed to follow her school friends like a bad smell. I nodded and hummed in all the right places, but my mind was already drifting.

That’s when I tripped.

Something jagged hooked my foot, and I stumbled forward, my friend’s hand darting out to catch me before I could crash face-first into the grimy ground.

“Bhai, aaram se chal,” she scolded, her voice sharp with concern. Her eyes scanned me, checking for injuries like I was some clumsy kid.

“I’m fine,” I muttered, still feeling the ghost of her grip on my arm.

We kept walking, her voice picking up where it left off, a comforting hum I barely noticed. But then I saw them. A group of guys from coaching, huddled near some wild, overgrown patch at the edge of the pavement.

They weren’t just hanging out. They were staring at something.

One of them was crouched down, elbows on his knees, eyes locked on something tangled in the mess of weeds and dirt. His hand hovered like he was too scared to touch whatever had caught his attention. The others stood around him, restless, their voices low and urgent.

But that one guy… he stayed frozen, like he was seeing something the rest of the world couldn’t.

My friend kept talking. I kept replying. But my words were automatic, mechanical. My focus was stolen by whatever had their attention. And then it happened.

Everything else blurred out.

Because we saw her.

The woman.

She was sprawled out on the ground like a discarded doll, limbs bent at angles that made my stomach lurch. Her back was pressed against the filthy pavement, partially swallowed by the weeds clawing through the cracks. It was like the earth itself was trying to reclaim her.

She looked like she was in her forties, maybe fifties. But it wasn’t age that had worn her down. It was something more brutal. A harshness that etched itself into her face, leaving her hollow and brittle. Her skin was ashen, stretched too tight over her bones. Her eyes, half-closed, were glassy and void, like something vital had been scraped away, leaving only emptiness.

Her mouth hung open just slightly, lips cracked and dry like paper left out in the sun. As if she’d tried to speak, but the words had disintegrated before they even left her throat.

And the flies.

God, the flies.

They swarmed her face, darting over her lips and nostrils, their tiny bodies flickering in the stale air like something too hungry to care. Crawling, twitching, feeding. They buzzed with a restless, relentless hunger, their noise drilling into my skull.

But she didn’t move. Not a flinch. Not even the smallest reflex to swat them away. Just...nothing.

Like she wasn’t even there anymore. Like she was some hollowed-out shell, left behind by whatever force had once made her human.

The air around her felt thick. Heavy. As if all the noise and life of the market had recoiled from her presence, leaving behind a bubble of dead, suffocating silence. It wasn’t just that she was lifeless. It was that everything around her felt...wrong.

I couldn’t look away. Neither could my friend.

We stood there, paralyzed, eyes locked on her like we were caught in some sick, twisted nightmare. Disgust coiled in my gut, bitter and sharp, but there was something worse. Something that clung to my skin like cold sweat and wouldn’t let go.

It wasn’t just her twisted limbs or the flies or even the terrible stillness. It was the absence.

That warmth you feel when someone’s alive, even if they’re unconscious. That faint, steady hum of existence. But with her? There was nothing. Just a void where life should’ve been.

The market roared on behind us. People bargained, laughed, shouted, their lives colliding with hers but never actually touching. They walked past her like she was nothing more than garbage strewn across the pavement. And those who did notice only spared her a single, indifferent glance before moving on.

Like she was nothing. Like she was less than nothing.

My throat was dry, my heartbeat this dull, heavy thud in my chest. I wanted to tear my eyes away from her, to walk away and pretend I hadn’t seen anything. But I couldn’t.

My friend wasn’t doing much better. Her face was pale, her eyes wide and unblinking. Fear. Disgust. Maybe even anger. It was all there, written across her features.

“Let’s just keep moving,” she whispered, her voice strained and shaky, her fingers clinging to my wrist like she was trying to pull me away from something too dark to face.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about her. About the way the world just kept moving, leaving her behind. About the way life could be so casually discarded.

Because somewhere deep in my gut, something twisted and refused to let go.
