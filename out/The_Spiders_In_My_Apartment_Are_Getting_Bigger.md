When I was a kid, my family had this swing set tucked away in the shade. It was this rusted thing that squeaked and shook whenever I would ride it. The long hollow tubes that staked it into the ground dug in deeper and deeper into the hard earth after every use.

I loved it, I would spend hours swinging in the breeze, felt like I was soaring through the air. It was a fun thrill for sure.

That is until one spring day-an eight-legged critter dangled down from the trees. I didn't notice it- too rolled up in my childhood bliss. I took one big swing, had to be 20, 25 feet off the ground. It looked so far away, like I had just jumped out of a plane. As I rushed down to meet it, scrapping the worn-out soil beneath-I felt this alien cling to my face as I swatted into it.

The thing panicked as it scurried over my face and proceed to get tangled in the jungle of my auburn locks. I let go of the swing and rushed to meet the Earth, cracking my nose on impact.

My parents were inside-they dropped everything at the sound of my instantaneous wails. I was rolling around on the ground-blood oozing out of my shattered nostrils, rambling to myself as I swatted and clawed at my head. They were concerned of course but I caught them stifling laugher when they heard me moan "A spida in my hair." at the top of my young, shrill lungs. 

Be honest, you're picturing it to yourself and holding back a smile aren't you. 

To you, my parents, every other friend who heard the story-it was a good laugh at my expense. Kids being dumb kids and hurting themselves on the playground, freaking out over nothing.

Forget the fact I could swear my nose still crooks to the left to this day.

Forget the fact it was a decent sized spider, probably a brown recluse. Did you know that while not normally fatal, their venom can cause sever necrosis of the flesh? Not so funny thinking about a six-year-old whose forehead is rotting off is it.

To this day my whole-body shivers when I walk under trees, my eyes darting upwards to make sure there no threats barreling down on me. I had nightmares for weeks about that thing-it's tiny, pincer-like legs galloping around my scalp.

Every morning, I would obsessively check my head for eggs or throbbing, infected bites. I was convinced it had left a parting gift. I got lucky though, no skin rotting off, no hundreds of tiny hatchlings bursting out of my head from unknown cysts.

Life went on-but the fear of that eight-legged terror lingered.

My phobia remained the focus of ridicule throughout my teenage years, following me even into the bowels of community college. Eventually I got a nice job at an accounting firm about an hour from home. It paid well and soon enough I was able to afford my very own one bedroom one bath apartment.

The complex-simply named Raker Heights- had a nice view of the downtown coastal town I had grown up in. From my bedroom window I could peek out and get a delightful view of swamp covered sands and ice-cold waters crashing into the beach. It's a quiet life but a cozy one. Could say it's quaint.

Of course, that all changed a few weeks ago-when I saw the web. It was the tail end of 6am-my hair was combed and smelling like fresh pine as I strode out the door. I was greeted by the growing rays of the morning sun as they cast their shadows on the hardwood halls. Further down the corridor, I heard the insistent yapping of old Mrs. Othello's mini doddle.

The window at the end of the hall-right next to the elevator, of course, had a dangling silk covered web glued to it. I furrowed my brow, proceeding with the appropriate amount of caution. The tattered web whistled in the alcove of the bay window. If you looked out it, you could see the end of the beach front-the entrance to a sea cave embedded in the rocks.

The web's shadows hung there-the whole thing looked like it was thrown up haphazardly. Like a child playing with Halloween decorations. Still as I waited for the elevator, I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck start to tingle, I just focused on door in front of me-tuning out the oddly spider-les web.

It was weird, like it had just popped into existence. When the door dinged, I jumped in and jabbed the "close" button relentlessly.

 At work I tried to tune out my intrusive phobias, but I found myself pondering the web, my whole body shivering at times like terrible tremors running up my spine.

What sort of demon was it anyway? The silk seemed torn and withered-perhaps a common house spider that had gotten too big for its britches.

What if it was an orb weaver-not normally one to bite but they could spin massive webs. What if grew while I was away-a more focused architect taking over and spinning a fine summer home? I pushed that aside and focused, I tried not think of silky webs wrapping prey so the beasts could liquify and devour at their leisure. I always felt bad for the flies, must be an awful feeling.

You're paralyzed from the venom and wrapped up all snug while it sinks its fangs into you. Unable to scream and cry-just feeling every molecule inside you shrivel up by those vampiric hell spawn.

Like I said-I tried to focus on other things.

Keyword try.

It was a long drive home that night, my eyes sinking heavier than the titanic. I just wanted to go home and collapse. Of course, I made the mistake of taking a glance at the webbed window. When the elevator dinged open, I tried to ignore it, but my eyes darted too quickly.

I jumped back and gasped. The web had grown massive-you couldn't even see out the glass anymore. Eldritch cobwebs stretched out and kissed the walls, sticky tendrils that crept up and tried to ensnare you in their grasp. Some unlucky bugs had gotten caught already-I could see their dried-out husks littering the structure.

I'm not misusing that phrase-the thing was so large it could have held the building up. It was like a condo for spiders.

Oh yes, the spiders.

I could see the little buggers now. They were plump and happily sleeping off their meals. Their abdomens were thick and lime green with silver strips.

My heart sunk into my chest as I banished my courage to the void.

Joro spiders, my god the news was true. These invasive parasites had parachuted in from South America like little arachnid paratroopers.

Deadly bite and-

that's when I saw the others.

Little baby spiders, brown ones, coal black jewels sprouting legs and scuttling about in their little complex. The joros were kings-but the ruled over the others in their little fiefdom.

*My god-cohabitation* I remember thinking. They had banded together, the spi-pocalypse had truly begun. Visions of spiders on horseback enslaving humanity rolled through my brain.

All ridiculous in hindsight of course-well maybe not NOW but I am embarrassed to say that my mind jumped to some pretty irrational conclusions.

It was just-as I lay on the floor, eyes bulging out of my skull in bold fright-I could swear I felt them watching me. Dozens, maybe hundreds of them cozy in their web, stalking me, daring me to come closer and become another husk.

A joro in the middle twitched and I bolted down the lone hall, my frantic steps echoing cowardice to my fellow tenants. I bolted my front door shut and instantly called the super. 

He answered with a deep sigh-he always had that annoyed tone whenever I called, God forbid the man do his job.

"Yes Mr. Langley, what is it this time. Another bug crawling up the drain?" He toyed with me.

 "Mr. Sampson have you been up to the 8^(th) floor today? There's a massive nest of venomous spiders nestled at the end of the hall. Surely I can't be the only one to complain, it's practically blocking the elevator." I screamed at him. 

I was met with a stiff silence at the end of the line. 

"We are aware of the current-situation Mr. Langley. Other tenants have called to express their concerns-rest assured that an exterminator has been called and it will be handled swiftly." He spoke like a corporate robot reading off a teleprompter. "I will add the 8^(th) to the list." He mentioned off hand. 

"What's that mean-are they infesting the whole building?" My voice gave way to shriveled panic. I was met with the monotone dial in response.

That night I tossed and turned and dreamt of shadowy things crawling all over me, their glistening fangs hungrily tearing into me. I felt trapped by a silky cocoon and awoke covered in sweat and curled up in blankets. 

I stared at the inky ceiling above-a cool breeze bearing down on me from A/C. There was a faint smell emitting from the ducts, like lemon pledge and pheromones.

Odd thing to say, but that's what it smelt like.

Above I could hear something bumping around in the ducts as drowsiness slowly left me.

Thinking the scuttling was nothing more than the remnants of a fleeting dream, I began my morning ritual of decaf and doom-scrolling. My feed was filled with news and trending memes, nothing important really just gave me a nice dopamine fill before I had to pass the construct.

The stairs weren't an option, not since I found that black widow lurking near the 5th floor balcony.

This was months ago mind you-but the venom of the widow is fifteen times more deadly than a rattlesnake.

So why take the risk.

Outside my door I heard mummering and excited commotion. I took a peep out the eyehole and through the bulbed fish-view I saw my fellow tenants gawking at something at the end of the hall. I joined them, dreading whatever had their attention.

I wish I had stayed in bed.

The webbed construct had grown overnight. Like a greedy fungus it had overtaken the windowsill completely-tendrils of silk stretching out and clinging to the walls. Web covered the walls and floors like a disgusting tapestry.

One of the tenants struggled to push his overgrown door-the web perfectly restraining it. He snuck out and dashed out the door as it slammed back in place, laughing to himself as he shivered and batted webbing off.

There was no rhyme or reasoning, the weavers had simply spread their domain like a cancer. Joros and other small spiders cluing to the wall-eying the crowd with unblinking glass bulbs. My head began to spin at the realization that others had appeared.

Larger species had joined the fray-huntsmen the size of my hand bolted up and down at vibrating speeds-overstimulated by the crowd no doubt. Tucked away in the corners I could see coal eyed wolf spiders-aggressive, hairy blighters.

Any times some of the smaller arachnid strolled too close they would lunge out. There were noticeable spots of prey caught in the web. Some small flies husked away, but one or two lumps were hairy-thin pink tails dropped down, limp to the world.

In the center of this kingdom was a massive brown tarantula feasting on something. It was completely entombed, like a newborn mummy. It was larger than the dried-up rats however- my mind wandered and played tricks on me.

I couldn't possibly have seen a quick flash of faded bronze and the jingle of dog tags. It was surly a coincidence that the faithful yapping of Mrs. Othello's mini doodle was missing.

Come to think of it she was nowhere to be seen as well.

I brushed that aside, my mind exploding with horrific scenarios as I tried to ground myself in reality. Unfortunately, as my legs quivered and my stomach churned, I couldn't deny the horrid sight before me.

Johnson from 8D nudged me and I jumped out of my skin as I faced him.

"Hey Randy-you seeing this?" He spoke with that hick accent a lot of the locals tried to hide, but you could always catch them slipping if you tried. 

"Y-yeah it's pretty wild." I replied as timidly as a mouse. The skin on my arms began to bubble and pop, the urge to cover up and scratch coming at me in waves.

"Was talking to Sampson about it last night, some kind of building wide infestation he said. Saw the bug bomb truck out front this morning-think they'll start in the basement first though." He shrugged. I scrunched my face at the news. 

"The basement? There's nothing down there but dust bunnies and cobwebs." I began. Johnson leaned in close, like we are about to become brothers in some secret coven.

"Well, that's where it started. Now this is all hearsay, but supposedly Conrad down on 2B just came back from South America. He teaches botany or something up at the college-Sampson says he slipped him a few hundred bucks to store some crates he brought back down there." Johnson whispered. 

"Sampson isn't supposed to do that-it's against regulations." I hissed, panic flooding my voice once more. Johnson rolled his eyes at me.

"Whatever. He thinks the spiders came from that, eggs hidden under leaves or something. Told me he's going to throw Conrad out on his ass-think I'll apply for his spot after." He beamed. Johnson shoulder checked me once more in a jovial manner and disappeared down the hall.

The crowd was beginning to disperse, some tenants shaken by the creatures, others joking. All the while the demons studied us.

One couple complained about taking the stairs as they passed-the infestation had begun to spread in the stairwell as well. I stood frozen among the silk, feeling thousands of eyes bore ravenous holes into me.

You could hear them rustling about on their threads, the rumbling patter of limbs scattering about. Johnson's explanation was ludicrous, it certainly wouldn't account for the amount of sub species, let alone the co-habitation.

I remembered thinking this was some sort of cosmic punishment when I ran back to the perceived safety of my apartment. I double bolted the doors-another ludicrous notion-and collapsed onto the couch, lungs beating out of my chest as I gasped for air. The room spun and welcomed me into an inky void.

I was only awakened by the dull vibration in my pocket. I grasped at it, finding my phone angrily buzzing. It was my manager, Sarah.

"Randy it's 930-do you feel like coming in today?" She said in a faux concerned tone. I cleared my throat and whispered hoarsely at her.

 "N-no Sarah I'm-I meant to call in I'm sorry." I bumbled out. It sounded like I had been gargling rocks, this sudden black out had sent me to an instant fever.

"I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you'll be able to make it in tomorrow?" There was a condemning tone to her voice. 

"It-Maybe not I'll have to see if they're done spraying." I slapped my self-idiot.

"Spraying for what exac-oh Christ is this about your bug thing?" I winced as she brought up old memories of me freaking out because of a spider I saw in the bathroom a few weeks ago. 

"Look it's not what you think-it's an infestation, I can't-I can't get out of the building."

"Randy they're bugs. And don't start ranting to me about venom or fatality statistics or whatever else. Either be in here by 10:30-or don't bother coming in at all. " She warned.  After she hung up, I rolled over and went back to sleep. In the morning, I would have to find a new job, one that was tolerant of my condition.

I awoke to the sensation of something warm and fuzzy crawling across my forehead.

I opened my eyes to find a black tarantula resting on my face-its pedipalps lighting tapping, searching for food. I shrieked like a banshee and tore off the beast- it flew through the air and slammed against a wall.

It crunched to the ground and quickly rolled to its feet and scurried away out of sight. I could hear the rapid thumping of its skinny limbs against the hardwood. I shot up like a pointed dagger-scanning for any sign of the intruder.

Out of the corner I saw it crawl back into a grate. After grabbing some bug spray-I buy in bulk for the winter months-I knelt down and examined it. Lightly grasping the edges of the grate were cancerous silk-and the sound of frantic thumping against metal.

I held my breath and emptied half the can on it. The silk receded and crumbled against the oppressive spray, and this-this chittering sound rang out, like a wounded animal. I went around the apartment spraying bug-be-gone at any surface.

I stuffed towels into the grates to block them, lodged blankets under the crease of the door like I was hotboxing the joint.

In a way I was, the toxic fumes began to swell up-vanquishing any stray pest that had wandered in. I began to feel lightheaded, and I collapsed back onto the couch.

I don't know how long I was out, but I awoke to the sound of thunderous frantic steps pounding above me. I jolted up and saw flashing lights outside my window. I snuck a peak past the blinds and saw police vehicles and armed cops pushing people out of the building. I recognized a few of them, they were covered in silk and some sort of red and green bile.

A spotlight shined down, and helicopter blades roared above. I was taken back by a sudden pounding on the door. I heard the muffled cry of Johnson shouting my name.

"Randy-Randy are you in there?!?" he shouted. There was fear in his voice, something I had never heard from the laid-back man I knew. 

"I'm here." I meekly spoke. I could hear movement all around me, some muffled cries of pain and anger from the frenzied neighbors above.

There was something else moving up there, erratic yet deliberate- a rapid *thumpthumpthumpthump* of some unseen assailant bearing down on them. A muted yell sprung as they crashed to the ground, shaking the celling.

I heard a low chittering, like mandibles rubbing together, and the cries for help were cut short and replaced with a low slurping sound. I focused on that sound- it was subtle, it reminded me of drinking out of a straw cup when I was young.

All around it were chirping sounds like excited insects, and pincer-like legs scurrying inside the walls, inside the ducts, inside my min-

*BOOMBOOMBOOM*

I was broken from my trance by the resumed pounding.

"Randy open up, we gotta delta the fuck outta here!" He shouted harshly through the door. I approached the door but stopped in my tracks as I head a low rumble, like a stampede of cattle. It was coming from outside-at the end of the cob webbed hall. 

"Aw fuck." Johnson muttered. He banged on the door with renewed vigor, in a mad dash to break it down. "Open up god damnit it-they're coming out of the walls-just AHHH" he cried out in pain as something sprinted towards him at lightning speed and pounced on him.

I could hear him struggling- pained grunts turned into a quick gasp and choked breaths that subsided quickly. All that was left was the mechanical thumping of the thing that attacked. It was circling around him, chittering to itself-like it was admiring a proud kill.

I heard a crunch-and that methodic slurping sound. It sounded disgusting up close, grinded up guts being sucked through an industrial tube. I was shaking, knees wobbling as I listened to the soft feasting outside.

I leaned closer to the door-dreading in my heart what I knew I would see. The fish view gave way to a frightful sight. The hall walls were streaked with crimson stained webs and dozens of arachnids of shapes, sizes and colors.

I glanced downward and clenched my stomach as it churned and boiled. The chitinous thing laying on Johnson's slowly shriveling corpse was massive. Its abdomen was burly and covered in brown fuzz. It was the size of a beachball.

Jointed legs sprouted out of its sternum, auburn rings around them. Its abyssal eyes seemed to spin around in its head-surveying the land as it fed.

Two black massive fangs were sunk into Johnson's back-they seemed to heave themselves inward, dripping a green bile into his body-rotting him from the inside as the creature drank.

It needlessly clung to him; all eight legs wrapped around the dead man in a vice grip. The thing seemed to shiver in ecstasy, like it was savoring every gulp of the slop that used to live in 8D.

I backed away from the door then, clamping my frantic hand to my gagging mouth as I tried to stop from throwing up. My mind spun like a loon from the impossibility of it all. Yet how could I deny the atrocity I had just seen just outside my door?

Feeling for it-I searched for my phone and dialed up the super. It was his building, he should know what to do.

The phone rang four times.

At the dawn of the fifth I heard the whispered, crazed voice of Sampson.

"H-hello? Mr. Langley? Are-are you still inside?' he whispered. In the background I heard scuttering and chirping, a clanging noise like they were searching for something. 

"Mr. Sampson- I would like to file a complaint. The infestation is still not delt with." I spoke calmly, robotic even. "Sampson held back a laugh and spat at me.

"Randy, are you out of your fucking mind? They've overrun the building-I've never seen anything like it. I saw the bug bomb guys in the basement. They were webbed to the wall-they were so-randy their faces were so hollow." he choked out.

"Mr. Sampson-I was assured this would be delt with swiftly." I urged. Far below, I heard shouts and gunfire-monsters crying out for blood. 

"Cops have breached the lower levels-I'm barricaded in my office. They evacuated half the building, but I don't think- *CRASH*\- shit, they're busting down the door. Oh god-they're- *BANG- BANG*\-"

His commentary was drowned out by a hail of gunfire and glass breaking. I heard men shouting and crying out in pain as the spiders overwhelmed them. Sampson clamored around, I think he was hiding under his desk. I could hear frenzied movement surrounding him as he panted and wheezed. 

"Mr. Sampson?" I squeaked out. 

"Oh god-no stay back no no no." He ignored me as I heard him land a kick on a gurgling beast. It hissed at him, then lunged as Sampson cried out and the call cut off.

I sat back down on the couch, weighing my options. I seemed to be safe for now-if I was quiet and kept spraying the grates to keep out the riffraff.

I wasn't going to leave of course; it was never an option. Even the day before, I had barely gotten past the small ones without freezing up. Surely the authorities would be able contain the things and rescue those trapped eventually. 

That was two days ago.

As I write this I hear tapping outside my door-a misshaped shadow lingering by it.

I can hear chittering echoing in the vents; webs are almost bursting out of the grates now.

An hour ago, they draped a massive tarp over the building. I have a faint Wi-fi signal; according to the news there was a "massive gas leak" inside that devolved into a biohazard, and they were cordoning off the building for quarantine.

They assured the public that it had been fully evacuated with minimal casualties.

I don't- I don't know how much longer I can hold out in here.

The power went out; I'm writing this on my phone. It has about 25 percent left. I should have made a break for it-but- God help me I was just too scared. I hear something crawling around on the door.

The taps are getting louder.
