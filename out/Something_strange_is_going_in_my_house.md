I walked up in a different room than the one I sleeped in I am sure of that. Maybe someone carried me when I was asleep but the main problem is that I live pretty much alone. I scratched my head trying to think of what possible reason could this be. So I called myself down and told me that I started night walking. There is nothing strange, just that I was night walking. 


So I sit down on my desk doing my work and talking to myself. Yeah I know it's weird but I love to talk to myself aloud when alone. It feels comforting and makes me feel less lonely since I am pretty much always alone. Then after a long work I went out to a local bar for some drinks and came home late, like around midnight I guess. I did not think about last night much and I crawled on the bed in my bedroom. I am sure of it as my head hit the bottom of the lamp placed sideway on the table near my bed and it fell down. So yes I slept there but the next morning was I there, yeah you guessed it NO! 


So I walked up to my living room. Maybe I was drunk and did not remember where I slept last night. Then I went to my bedroom and the lamp was still there on the floor, fortunately it was just minorly damaged but nonetheless I teleported strangely. It was hard to focus on my works arranging paperworks and my mind was still half assessing about what happened last night. I stopped my work and midway started googling about the possibility of teleportation. There were some results about how scientists have achieved teleportation, intrigued I clicked on the top article. It was a click bait after reading it all I realised it was just about one single particle. Same things followed below. Anyways the night came crawling back again and this time I did not head out. I locked every single door tight, latched out all windows curtain at the front. Put my dirty useless clothes below the little openings of all doors. There were 2 rooms between my living room and my bedroom. So I shut the doors of the rooms in between tight and put a lock on each of the doors. Then I placed both keys in different hiding location. One was just below my pillow, the other at the cupboard at the side. I know you all would say I shouldn't have done so much, it was maybe just because I was simply sleep walking but I don't know how to explain that I feel something wrong here. Something sinister. Yeah so I didn't stop there, next I tied myself to my bed tightly and made sure the rope was taut. That's how I slept.


The next day when I wake up, yup you got it. I was in my living room. I stractched my head and then hit it with the wall near. Yeah I was going crazy but something was wrong here. I felt a tight shiver on my spine. Also there was no lock on the doors I put one and I found the lock with the keys in my bedroom. That was too much, maybe I was going crazy and some rest is all I need. I was dying to just go and seek professional help but would they even believe me? Heck I don't believe myself, there's no explanation other than I am crazy. So I thought of not going for it, what I did was closing all my work and booking for a vacation on the other side of the planet. My flight was scheduled just 3 days from now and all those 3 days I awoke in my living room. Anyways I just ignored it, I know cameras are a good idea but they were expensive in my area so had to put them down for now. The flight was very cozy and despite my introverted nature I think I found a friend for the first time. I know it's a very short time but the person sitting on the flight next to me, Sarah we quickly connected about many things and shared some interests like collecting cards. I know that she would not consider me as a friend anyway, just a nice guy at the flight but that doesn't matter. I was here to enjoy the present after all and nice guy I was. 


On the other side I stayed at a hotel. There were so many tourist destinations for me to visit the next day and I was tired travelling for so long. That's why I went to bed at my hotel a little bit early. The next day I rose fresh and stretched my hands yawning. It was such a cool feeling, like light breeze and today I was going to travel so much. Then I climbed out of my bed and my senses hit, I was back at my home at my living room. Fuck fuck I don't know what to do. I called Sarah and she asked me where I was, I told her that I was back at home. She was shocked. She told me I was kidding right as there was a big storm and all flights were cancelled, so no way I could have covered up such a huge distance overnight. Like it was just impossible but I told her what I told her. Things were strange and I wanted to let it out, out to someone but still I did not tell Sarah anything. You see she was out there to enjoy their vacation so why must I needlessly worry her. So I am telling you all, does someone anyone know **how to stop waking up to my living room every morning....**
