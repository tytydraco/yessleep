In hindsight, maybe there were a few things I could’ve done differently. Hell, probably more than just a few. Maybe when my mom told me to go into any other trade I should’ve listened. Can you blame me though? After hearing about the average income I would potentially be making as an electrician, I signed up for trade school the next day. The only problem is I never knew that the ‘average’ meant nothing when living in a state like West Virginia. I started my apprenticeship making sixteen dollars an hour. The job I landed was with a local Electrical company, Mountain State Electric. I proceeded to work there for four years, eventually earning my journeyman's license. Unfortunately, I never received any form of raise or bonus while working under their umbrella. I was told the “young bucks” like me should be happy getting paid in job experience, that the little pay I did take home was more a formality than anything. After eating only ramen for weeks on end and pleading with my landlord to give me a few more days to make rent, I knew something had to change.

I ended up finding an online group for my neighborhood, titled ‘Neighbors Helping Neighbors’ and decided to join. There I began advertising some of the services I could provide as a side hustle. Needed a new security system installed? I was the man for the job. Wiring jobs becoming too much of a pain to deal with? I’ve got you covered. Things started off slow, as you’d expect, but picking up a few small jobs here and there gave me just enough financial breathing room to sleep a little easier at night. Word of mouth began to spread and suddenly folks all across town were asking for my help. The workload began to pile up quickly. Jobs that I once could get done in a few hours had to be scheduled out two or sometimes three weeks in advance. Still, I could never bring myself to tell them no. I’ve always had a hard time with that, turning away someone in need, even if it meant running myself into the ground.

Things didn’t work out so well with Mountain State. Once my boss found out I was working side jobs he accused me of stealing potential clientele and booted me to the curb. I was almost relieved, honestly. This just meant I had more time to make right on the promises I’d made with my own customer base. I used some of the little savings I had left and purchased my own utility van from a fellow tradesman who had just retired from the field. The thing wasn’t in great shape, but it was mine. I had a buddy of mine who worked at a nearby body shop that really spruced up the old girl. New interiors, a fresh coat of paint, and he even threw in one of those pine scented fresheners free of charge. It finally came down to what I wanted painted on the side of the van, how I wanted to present my business to the residents of Elkins. I was never a very creative man, so I just settled on Richard’s Electric. I even included a small tagline written in cursive beneath the logo, stating, “service you can trust, no questions asked!”

Jobs continued coming in, but with all the extra time granted to me by my newfound independence I was able to keep up. Mostly. The allure of the almighty dollar along with keeping up with work obligations meant I was usually out seven days a week. I would come home to my wife, Grace, beyond exhausted every night. The type of exhaustion that makes you wish to be in some tragic accident, one that would put you into a coma for a few years, just to know what some decent rest feels like. “You can’t keep doing this to yourself,” she’d say as I collapsed into our bed. “I know you’re trying your best, and I’m so proud of you for going on as long as you have, but this is too much. Maybe it’s not too late to get in touch with Michael, see if he can get you your position back with Mountain State.” Just the thought made me want to die.

“I can’t do that honey,” I said, my face still buried deep into my pillow. “I’ve got lots of people relying on me now, not just you.” I could tell my words had struck a nerve, the silence in the room became deafening. “Besides, there’s no chance in hell Michael would take me back,” I groaned. “And why is that, Richard?” I sighed, here comes trouble. “Because… on my way out of the office I may have… ‘borrowed’ his client contact sheet.” If she wasn’t already fuming, that pushed her over the edge. “Jesus Christ, so there goes that idea. Why would you even think to do that? You some sort of kleptomaniac now or something?” I scoffed at the idea. “Michael accused me of stealing his customer-base when he fired me. I figured, hell, if he was going to accuse me of it, why not give myself a much needed head start? I did what I had to do to keep us afloat, Grace. Would you rather we sink?” She stood from the bed, a defeated look on her face. “No, I just…” she made her way towards the bedroom door. “I just wish my husband was still married to me, and not to his work.” She left, taking any chance of me sleeping in a bed tonight along with her. 

Maybe she was right, I thought, sprawled out on our living room sofa. It had been three months since I’d had an actual day off. Three months of wires and bulbs and conduit. Three months of aching joints and popping kneecaps. Maybe I could afford to give myself a day off, hell, two wouldn’t hurt. I sighed, my conscience suffocating me with guilt. I knew any cancellations I would need to make would almost certainly come back to bite me. Word spreads fast when you’ve wronged someone in Elkins. I picked up the phone, Grace’s words still ringing through my head, and made the call. “Good morning Mrs. Rodriguez,” I began. “Unfortunately, I won’t be able to make it over to you today, something came up last second.” There was a momentary silence on the other end. “Well… I was really hoping to get my doorbell camera installed today. I even told my boss I’d be in late so we could get it done. What other days are you able to come over?” I wasn’t sure what to say, the empathetic part of me wanted to apologize profusely, the other part wanted to tell her to figure it out on her own and hang up. “It may be a while unfortunately, I have quite a few people scheduled out for the next month or so.” I knew this wasn’t the answer she was hoping to hear from me. She began screaming into the phone, mostly in Spanish. I couldn’t understand a word, besides the few descriptors she threw in that were still in English. ‘Worthless’ being one, ‘asshole’ being another. I just responded, “I’ll be in touch, thanks for understanding” and ended the call.

I was so invested in the phone call I hadn’t noticed my wife had begun hovering over my shoulder to listen. “She sounded mad.” I tensed up, my heart ready to explode from my chest. “Jesus, Grace, don’t do that to me,” I said through a panicked breath. “You still scare so easily,” she said, exposing a toothy grin. My eyes met hers, I could see that she knew what I was planning, even worse, she agreed with it. I shifted away. “It doesn’t feel right, Grace, these people needed my help. Am I being selfish?” She laid her hands on my shoulders, “You are anything but.” She kissed me. “Got any more calls to make?” I looked down to my planner, “Only four more to go for today, wish me luck.” She smiled again, “maybe I wanted to hear people cuss you out some more, can’t I stay and listen?” I begrudgingly smiled back. “Good luck,” she said before leaving me in silence once again. I reached for the phone, mentally preparing myself for the hellfire that was to come. 

Things didn’t go much better with the other calls. Lots of disappointment and even more creative insults were lobbed my way. If I weren’t so horrified by them I might have written some down to use at a later date. It reached the point where I only had one more call to make, specifically to a Mrs. Calhoun. She lived in a part of town I had never been to. It was somewhat secluded compared to most areas I serviced, but it was close enough that I couldn’t use the distance from me as my reasoning to not show. I was too close to the finish line to give up now, I was sure that an excuse would come to mind as I began dialing her number. It rang once, then twice, then a third time. Maybe she was away? Maybe if I hung up now, I’d be scott free to enjoy my day off. The line picked up. Damnit. “Hello?” It was an older, raspier voice on the other end. “Good morning, is this Mrs. Calhoun I’m speaking with?” I asked, masking how let down I truly felt in the moment. “It is. And this must be the Mr. Richard I’ve heard such wonderful things about.” I let out a halfhearted chuckle, “good guess.” 

There was an awkward pause between us. “Listen, unfortunately I’ve run into a bit of an issue as of late.” Time to improvise. “I’ve had this stomach bug the last few days, been spraying out my backside like a firehose. I won’t be able to see you today.” That may have been a little too much improvisation. More silence. “I see,” she muttered, her voice beginning to quiver. “Well I hope you start feeling better soon.” I sighed “I’m sorry ma’am. I’ll be in touch as soon as I’m able to swing by.” Before I was able to end the call, she let out a desperate “wait please!” I should’ve pretended not to hear her pleading, but was unable to stop what forced its way out of my lips. “What else can I help you with?” She began to gently sob. “Do you know anyone else who can help me? Usually I would leave these types of repairs to my husband, but he’s… well he’s just not quite himself these days.” Her sobbing grew louder. “I just… really need a win right now is all. Please, anyone you know who can come out today.” My heart sank. There was nobody at Mountain State who would want to hear from me, much less care about the trials and tribulations of some random old lady I’d only just met. I let out another, heavier sigh.

“Well, I suppose your toilet works just as well as mine does. I’ll bring some spare toilet paper just in case.” I could hear her crying reduce to a sniffle. “Are… are you sure?” There was nothing more I wanted in that instance than a reason to tell her no. “Of course ma’am, I’ll start heading over shortly.” I ended the call. What had I gotten myself into? I was five minutes away from a warm bath and a margarita. Now I was stuck putting on my work boots as quietly as possible so as to not attract the ire of Grace. If I were to take care of this job as quickly as I could, maybe she wouldn’t even notice I had left. Maybe that bath water would still at the very least be lukewarm by the time I made my return. This was just a speed bump along the way to an otherwise relaxing afternoon. At least, that’s what I told myself as I left for Mrs. Calhoun’s home. If only things had turned out that way.

I pulled up to the address that was provided on the contact sheet. The home sat, half-swallowed by overgrown ivy and trees that had an unnatural lean to them, almost as to usher visitors towards the dilapidated brick cottage. It was the type of place that made every fiber of my being scream ‘hell no.’ And yet, against my better judgement, I approached the home. The front steps creaked with every advancement I made. I reached out my hand to ring the doorbell when suddenly the front door abruptly swung open. I tried and failed to act as if I hadn’t been startled by the motion. It was Mrs. Calhoun. She was small in frame, her eyes sunk deep into her head and her cheekbones protruded further than they had any business to. Her lips were painted a brittle red that cracked at the corners when she smiled. She was well past her prime, that was for certain. “I apologize for scaring you young man, I was just so excited to meet you.” She held out an outstretched hand. “You must be Richard,” she said. “That’s what my parents told me,” I joked, trying to forget that a woman in her seventies just scared the daylights out of me. I shook her hand, her grip being surprisingly stronger than I had anticipated. “It’s nice to meet you, Mrs. Calhoun. Could you remind me again what you needed serviced today?” She peered deep into her home, “the lights in the kitchen, darned things are on the fritz again. Flashing on and off all day, it’s enough to make somebody go crazy.” She looked past me, her eyes locked firmly on my van. “No questions asked?” She smiled to herself. Her eyes, filled with intrigue, met mine once again. “I like that.”

She welcomed me into her home, her entryway a long corridor filled with dozens of framed photographs. She stopped to admire them for a moment. Every image was of a young couple and their son, the photos presumably decades old at this point. “I’m assuming these are of you and your husband?” Her breathing became heavier. “Yes, my Anthony,” she muttered. She held out a finger to caress his two-dimensional face. “You two look so much alike.” The resemblance was certainly there, but the comparison seemed slightly exaggerated. “I guess I’ve just got one of those faces, ma’am.” Her attention snapped back to me. “You can quit with the pleasantries, Richard. Please just call me Maggie.” I smiled, “Maggie it is then.” I pointed her attention back to the wall of photos. “I’d certainly like to meet your husband Anthony as well, it’s rare I get to meet a long-lost twin.” She smiled back. “Oh, I'm sure you will. I reckon he’s hiding around here somewhere.” We made our way towards the kitchen.

The first thing that struck me, even before noticing the flickering light, was the smell. Dirty dishes were pouring out of the sink, assumedly having not been cleaned for several months. There was a mountain of trash bags blocking the back door, some appearing to have torn open from the weight of their contents. Sprinkled throughout the litter was what I could only assume were hundreds of rodent droppings. None of this seemed to bother Maggie, she had more than likely grown accustomed to the stench. I attempted to remain professional, holding back the urge to bury my nose into my shirt. I looked up to the singular bulb that illuminated the kitchen. I’d seen issues similar to this one, more than likely just faulty wiring or a loose connection somewhere. “I’ll be right back,” I said. “I’ll need to get a better look higher up, just need to get my step ladder from the van.” She watched me as I haphazardly scurried out the front door. I took the deepest breath I’d ever taken once I reached the porch. The miasma was still there, ever so faintly. I wondered how Mrs. Calhoun could live like this. Someone her age could get seriously ill from these living conditions. Maybe taking care of their home had just proven to be too much for her and Anthony to handle. I made my way to the van to retrieve the ladder, as well as to see if I had any business cards for local caregivers. On my way back towards the home, I noticed the blinds in the kitchen window quickly rustle shut. She had been watching me this entire time.

She greeted me once again at the door. “Is everything okay? You were gone for a while, I wasn’t sure if…” her face became flushed. “If you were going to have an accident.” She handed me a small cup filled with a thick pink fluid. “Pepto-Bismol,” she said. I could feel my own face growing red. “Thank you, but I actually took some before coming over.” I patted my stomach, “crisis averted for now.” We laughed and made our way back into the kitchen, or at least from what I could tell was the kitchen. The bulb had turned off while I was away, leaving us to fumble around in the dark looking for the light switch. Even upon finding the switch, the light refused to cooperate. Definitely a wiring issue. I pulled a flashlight out of my toolbag, but before I had the chance to power it on, the kitchen light buzzed, then flashed. And suddenly, he was there. 

A man stood in the far corner-silent, unmoving. His skin was waxy and pale, arms stiff at his sides. His mouth was parted slightly, exposing an unnerving smile. Worst of all were his eyes. They had the appearance of dull marbles, gleaming under the overhead light. I let out a frightened yelp. My heart pounded like a war drum in my chest. “There you are,” Maggie cooed, walking over to the figure. “You know, it’s rude of you to not greet our guest Anthony!” My pulse slowly began to stabilize. “Nice to meet you, sir. You got me pretty good.” I held out a hand to greet him. “I’m here to take a look at that light for you. I’ll be in and out of your hair in no time.” He didn’t accept my greeting, his hands remained stationary. He just stared me down, his eyes noticeably bulging and alert. Maggie began laughing hysterically “I don’t think he’s going to respond to you anytime soon.” She knocked on his chest, a hollow noise ringing out. She grinned at me, “taxidermy."

“He…” I could barely make out the words “your husband is dead?” She began running her fingers through his hair. “He’s more like a preserved soul,” she corrected. “I never enjoyed the idea of my Anthony rotting away in the ground somewhere away from me.” She kissed his lifeless cheek. “Why should death mean decay?” My blood had run cold, all color draining from my face. “Hold on a minute, is this even legal? I mean, could you get in trouble if someone were to find out?” She laughed once again. “Oh Richard, whatever happened to no questions asked?” This was too much. I could feel my stomach twisting and turning into knots. My mind, bursting with questions. Should I call someone? Would she go to jail over this? Should I make a run for the door? Should I… my stomach began to rumble. Maybe the Pepto-Bismol wasn’t such a bad idea. “Mrs. Calhoun… Maggie…” I began, my voice hoarse from the lump in my throat. “Could I by chance use your bathroom? Afterwards I can get started on that light.” Her attention jumped from Anthony back to me. “Of course you can, it’s just down the hallway, second door on your left.” I locked the bathroom door behind me, feeling better now that some distance had been placed between the two of us. 

I sat there for a moment after taking care of my business. There were so many emotions I was wrestling with, the strongest and least expected of which was sympathy. Maggie clearly loved her husband. She wasn’t ready for him to leave, and yet he did anyway. Although I didn’t agree with her methods of keeping him around, it ultimately wasn’t my choice to make. Anthony was dead, and Mrs. Calhoun needed my help. I flushed the toilet and decided to get back to work. Before I could get far, however, I found myself frozen in the hall. Maggie was no longer standing at the kitchen counter. Instead, she was in the middle of the kitchen, holding Anthony’s stiff, lifeless hand. She was swaying to an invisible beat, her feet shuffling in time with a rhythm that was all her own. The motion of the dance wasn’t graceful; it was jerky. The two of them, one living one dead, were locked in some kind of twisted, unholy waltz. I was unsure if she had noticed me staring from the hallway. Hell, I doubt she would have cared anyways. 

“I hope I’m not interrupting anything,” I said, hoping to make my presence known. She continued to dance, her eyes never once leaving Anthony’s dry gaze. “Not at all, dear. We were just reminiscing about our wedding day.” She looked to me, cupping a hand over her mouth so as to not let her husband hear what she was about to say. “Anthony always had two left feet when it came to this sort of stuff. I had to teach him everything I knew just so he wouldn’t embarrass himself in front of my family,” she chuckled to herself. In an instant, she grabbed Anthony by the arm, pulling him in so that his lips were near her ear. “What’s that?” she asked, a frown slowly forming over her face. “Oh please, it was me that taught you, silly. It wasn’t the other way around.” Confusion filled Maggie’s withered face. “Or… at least I don’t think it was.” This was like some screwed up episode of the Twilight Zone and I wanted no part in it. She continued to argue with herself as I left to switch off the circuit breaker. There was already one corpse in this home, sure as hell didn’t need to add mine to the mix.

I returned to a home that was once again swallowed by darkness. It had gone quiet, the only noise coming from the creaking of old floorboards beneath my boots. “Maggie? I just got back from shutting the power off. Shouldn’t take long now.” Nothing. I tried once again to call out into the void, my voice beginning to crack. “Mrs. Calhoun?” Only silence. I shined my flashlight down the hallway, toward what I assumed was her bedroom. Maybe she had gone to lie down? It wasn’t implausible, an older woman like her needing rest in the middle of the day. I grabbed my ladder and got to work, making an attempt to keep any noise to a minimum. The job seemed easy enough. The wiring was frayed, but salvageable. I began to remove the faulty section when suddenly, I heard it. From the hall behind me came slow, deliberate footsteps. I turned, expecting to catch the silhouette of Maggie observing my handiwork. Nobody was there. This place had to be getting to me, I thought. I resumed from where I left off. Some time later, I heard it again. One step. Then another. The sound of something stiff was being dragged behind the footsteps. I turned once again. Nothing. I stood there a moment, listening for the origin of the sound. It seemed to be coming from the room at the end of the hall. After glancing over my shoulder every ten seconds, I finally finished splicing the wire. I switched the breaker back on, causing the bulb to blink to life, buzz, then hold steady. My job here was done.

I packed up my tools and stepladder and quietly made my way towards the front entrance, careful of not making any unnecessary noise. Maybe I could leave her a note or call her from the van regarding payment, but that wasn’t at the top of my mind. What I was concerned with was how quickly I could get from here to back home in my bathtub. I didn’t get the chance to make it that far. As I passed the foyer, I heard her voice. “You know it’s rude to leave without saying goodbye.” I stopped mid-step. She was seated in the parlor off the hallway. It was one of those rooms you could tell hadn’t been used in years. Protective plastic covered the furniture. The only light in the room came from a small table lamp, one that cast long shadows across a table covered in yellowing newspapers and rusted cigarette tins. She motioned to the loveseat opposite of her. Anthony had been crudely propped up on one of the cushions. “Would you sit down with me, Richard? If only for a moment. I made us some tea.” I hesitated. “I really should be going, I appreciate the -” her eyes burned with disapproval. “Just for a moment, and then you may leave.” Something in her tone stopped me cold. It seemed less like an invitation for me to sit and more like a command. 

I set my bag down and slowly lowered myself into the seat. The couch let out a pained groan beneath me. She handed me a cup, her hands shaking as she poured. “Anthony always liked his tea strong,” she said. She began pouring for her husband next. “Hated weak things in general. Hated when people tiptoed around him.” She took a long sip from her glass. “He liked people that spoke plainly, said honesty was the only thing that separated a man from a weasel.” I nodded along politely, unsure of where this conversation was going. ”So, which are you, Richard?” I was taken aback by her question. “I’m sorry?” She leaned forward in her seat. “Are you a man or a weasel?” She could see that I was still having a hard time understanding. “Let me speak plainly then. Anthony tells me you can be trusted, and he isn’t usually one to be wrong about that sort of stuff.” She looked lovingly towards his stiff frame, then back to me.                 “I just ask that you be honest with us. Why is it that my husband's condition didn’t run you off like the others?” I could feel the sweat starting to build up on my forehead. “I… I don’t know. Honestly I was a little creeped out when I first met him.” I turned to look at Anthony, his beady gaze filled me with discomfort. “I guess,” I started, slowly, “I stayed because it felt like you really needed the help. And it didn’t feel right… leaving you alone with everything going on.” I motioned towards the kitchen, trying not to make it obvious what I really meant. 

Her eyes softened, her smile returned. “You really do remind me of him,” she said again. “When we first met, Anthony wasn’t this big tough guy. He was loyal. Always knew what to do, what to say. People trusted him wholeheartedly, and if he did someone a favor, he never asked anything in return.” I forced a polite smile. “Sounds like a good man.” Her smile slowly disappeared and her eyes clouded. “He was.” She took another sip of her tea. “He had a big heart, and that heart loved fiercely. Even in death, you know.” She stared into her teacup, her voice drifting. “Especially in death.” I cleared my throat. “Well, like I said I should probably–” Maggie stood up abruptly, cutting me off. “Before you go,” she said, moving toward a dusty cabinet in the corner of the room. She reached inside and pulled from it a checkbook. “I believe payment is in order for a job well done!” She scribbled a number onto one of her checks and handed it to me. Her handwriting was nearly illegible, the only thing that could clearly be made out was the amount. “Ma’am I can’t take this much from you.” I most certainly could have, but it didn’t feel right being paid $5,000 for what amounted to an hour's worth of work. She pushed the check away. “Nonsense, you made your way over here and helped us, even while feeling so under the weather. Me and Anthony are in agreeance on this. Please, take it.” I didn’t push back again, I simply slipped the check into my pocket and offered a business card for Cheryl’s Caregiving, a local business I’d had positive experiences with in the past. “Just in case you two need anything and I’m not around.” 

She stood from her seat, taking the card and my empty glass from me. We walked together out to the porch, the sound of Anthony’s shoes scraping the floor could be heard from behind me. I packed up my equipment and waved a friendly goodbye before entering the van. My thoughts were scattered as I made my departure from the Calhoun estate. I had just made my weekly income in the span of one morning and for whatever reason I didn’t feel good about it. I felt disgusted, both in the situation and in myself. I should never have accepted this job, I should have turned my dumb ass around as soon as I saw the place. As soon as I saw him. I looked into the rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. Maggie was waving farewell in my direction. Maybe it was the lack of sleep from the night before, or perhaps some trick of the mind, but it appeared Anthony was waving as well.
