I’ll be honest with you, I’m going to have to make this quick. They are searching for me and it’s only a matter of time before they find me. I don’t know how much longer I can keep going like this. I’m terrified that they’ll find me and force me to perform my turn in the ritual. I just don’t know how much energy I have left though to keep evading them, which is ironic really…considering I’m imprisoned in my best friend’s energy drink factory.

“Ride the Wave to Success”, they all chanted, just out of earshot.

I knew that I should have listened to my gut last year. Charlotte Anne’s plan was too good to be true. Her idea for a healthy, guilt-free energy drink that costs over eight dollars a bottle was pure madness. Beauty, riches, everlasting youth… she promised it all with vague slogans and add campaigns that littered social media. Her videos, done in the style of a fake lifestyle vlogs, showed beautiful and successful men and women living amazing lives. Their wealth accentuated by strategically staged bottles and imbibing of goji-berry and Taurine laced sugar water that she called “Ocean Pearl”.

Of course, nobody bought the stupid drink. At least, not enough to make any real money from direct sales. It was just too expensive and strange looking. Falsely marketed as a “health drink”, its only real health benefits were the oddly floating black goji berries which gave the expensive drink a purplish hue. 

The chants were getting louder... They must be circling back. The tempo of the singing started to pick up. The uniformity of their singing seemed almost trance-like.  

What the hell do I do? Why did I get myself wrapped up in this psycho’s cult. 

I guess I was desperate for cash. I thought she was offering me, her best friend since college, a real job…not some “Buy in” to join her multi-marketing-level scheme. I was a sucker though, just like everybody else. Her bizarre new persona of a modern-day, wealthy Taoist caught me off guard. Like someone who just found religion and was eager to share its hidden treasures with the world. Why didn’t I see through all that? Her flashy lifestyle was completely at odds with the message she was preaching. If only I had known all her wealth came from all the suckers like me that bought into her charming nonsense…

None of it was worth it. Charlotte Anne, to this day, has never paid me one cent. Me however, oh I’ve gone into massive dept for her. Not only that, but I’ve also alienated essentially all my other friends and extended family. Even my own parents seemed to be avoiding me. It’s not my fault if I had to try and sell this dumb product to everyone that I knew. I just didn’t see any other way out…

“I think she’s over near the receiving dock”, a loud voice boomed out across the factory floor. It was Marcus, otherwise known as Energy Knight. The highest rank of her odd “Energy Army” hierarchy that she implemented within her sales force. I don’t know what Marcus’ sales numbers were, but I’m sure the actual reason he rose to that level was his fervent loyalty to Charlotte Anne’s philosophy. His massive six-foot seven frame didn’t hurt either, I’m sure.

“I see her, she’s running through the front!!”, someone else shrieked. I tried to make it to other side of factory but felt someone grab the back of my dark blouse. 

“Oh, Birdy. Where were you running off to??? These team building exercises are meant to help us. There is nothing to be afraid of if you truly believe”, Charlotte Anne said as I was being held down by Marcus. Her tranquil mood belied the fact that she had already just killed two other people during the company’s compulsory retreat at the factory. It was no surprise to me that the other two people were Richard and Eileen, who had asked about being let out of their contracts. Their deaths were conveniently botched “Trust Falls” that they had to perform from the top of a hastily erected stage in the middle of the cafeteria. The only other member who had asked to be let out of their contract was me…

“I wasn’t running, I was just nervous. I swear Charlotte Anne!”, I pleaded to her. Her placid, emotionless smile told me that she didn’t care what I said in the slightest. 

“Oh, don’t worry. This will all be over before you know it. I’m sure you’ll do fine…”

Luke, an “Energy Lieutenant” came up and whispered into Charlotte Anne’s ear. She nodded and then whispered to him in return. After several moments of silent reflection, she nodded to Marcus who pulled me up and with one hand snapped a sharp salute. Suddenly I was being “marched” over to the rear stairwell instead of to the stage in the middle of the cafeteria. 

“You know what Birdy. I’m sorry to say that I get the sad impression that you don’t really believe in our mission. That’s why we have another test for you. If you’re not with us, that must mean you are with THEM. And if you are with THEM, our competitors, you can just drink their energy drink instead.”

Marcus was now holding me next to the rooftop ledge of the factory building. I briefly looked down before gasping and then looked outwards to the distant city skyline. I didn’t have any other choice, so I clamped my teary eyes shut. 

“Oh Birdy, you need to open your eyes so you can take a sip. Don’t worry, after a sip of THEIR drink, I’m sure you’ll be able to fly far, far away…”
