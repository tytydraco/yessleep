hey um, whoever is reading this, what the actual fuck did i just find in my pc? basically my pc disk e broke down and i had to go to disk c with smaller storage whatever after that i returned my desktop folder from e to c disk, yeah i mostly got everything i had but now i have 12 notes about what seems like a crazy fucking guy (might be me in the future but id just rather kms than kill other people)

is this some kind malware? has anyone had this shit before?

the notes were scrambled so there is no order, this is random... anyways take a look

name: dont do not look dont look at me i dont want it



when i leave.. either for the day or forever.. it is always strange seeing them



They look and I look away, how dare they ask for eye contact when they

wouldnt show me common decency when we were forced in a room

together



i go back in the car when i see someone from there, and i think about

killing them :::: I think about killing a lot of people, i think about

strapping them to a chair and beating their face into a pulp with

an aluminum bat. ive decided she doesnt deserve beauty



name: they just dont get it and never will

I recall watching the news after VT happened last april



between the rambles of gun control an NRA member looked into the

camera as if he was trying to talk to kids like me, im paraphrasing:

"if you are a student and feel alone, threatened, frightened, or inferior..

lashing out at the world with fatal violence like this is not the answer"



I dont want to kill them because im lonely, they just need a wake up call.

most classes I sit alone, no one speaks to me. last week a girl who gets

plenty of attention for her looks was venting to the teacher about how

she didnt fit in.. mentioning she only knew her boyfriend and thats it...

isnt that great irony? im lightyears from getting anything close to a girlfriend,

she sees no one talks to me, yet vents right in front of me about how little

she has socially.



I am not jealous, just sick of the ignorance she and many others exhibit.

their cozy little world, I want to destroy it. 

I want to destroy it and look them in the eye while I do it.

I want them to remember me.



name: what about me, what ABOUT me 2010

they all run off after getting their diplomas

as the months go by I slowly start to realize they didnt talk to me

and laugh at everything I said because they liked me, they did

it to pass the time while they felt trapped in walls of boredom



this was the real world as I now knew it, not even admissions offices

humored me without any extra curriculor clubs on my transcript...

no one would ever let me in one. I have been working at a gas station

to pass the time. Someone who laughed at me in school pulled up

with a fancy car, trying to avoid eye contact as much as they could.



do they feel guilty? or maybe just past the point of looking for comic relief

I guess 45 seconds at the pump isn't enough time for novelties like me

name: theanswerismaybejaajajajjajajaja

can they call it a hate crime when everyone had to go??????????????

?????????????????????????????????????????????????????

name:victims 2006 breed 2008 victims i want to kill myself look at me

I really do wonder sometimes if I was the only one who joined

for the feeling of friendship. feeling like a part of a clique.



sure it is classified as a hate group, but it was the only group that

pretended to love me.

when you know youre hopeless, pretending is all you can hope for

name: so close yet so 4375457far

i have to hear about her and she isnt even dead.. 

name: attention5is6privilege7

the biggest non factor in news i have ever heard in this school





















at least someone talks to her

name: shut up about this bitch4

announcement after announced on the intercom



"lets take a moment of silence for her"



"its been one week"



"its been one month"



so on and so forth



no one hated her when she died, I wonder if the intercom would

say my name that many times if I went early....

name:she will never know who and its not fine

every video I post a comment, I actually post several



never my face on the profile picture

never a username that suggests who I might be

never the same account



I post with the curiosity of seeing if that she would ever reach out

to me, curious as to who I am like the rest of the world seems to be

for her



I hate her

I call her an attention whore

And yet I wish I had the acceptance and social stimuli she takes for granted

I could be her friend if she gave me a chance

name :i am the ball the ball the ball

its an interesting paradox



women im not interested in tell me to be open with my emotions

they say its wrong that boys dont express their sadness and vulnerability

but the women who might consider me absolutely hate it. they think

im a freak when i communicate any desire beside generosity



the world of the living is a game of paddleball...

guess whos the ball
