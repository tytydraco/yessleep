"Go inside Room 136 of the Telmont Inn. Sit on the bed facing the mirror, and count to 10. If you can do it, I'll give you $20."

"Why? So I can get in trouble with whoever owns the room?" I asked.

"No, no. The rooms under renovation," said my friend, "and it's been under renovation since the eighties. There's just a piece of caution tape on the handle and that's all. Nothing to stop you from going in."

"And you just want me to sit on the bed and count 10?"

He nodded. "Just count to 10."

"And you have the money?"

He showed me a crisp, $20 bill.

"Alright," I said, "if that's really all it'll take to impress you."

I turned and walked through the double doors of the Telmont Inn. Inside, many a people were talking and having a good time. The waitress was too busy with drinks to notice me come in. I slipped into the corridor at the far end without a single one of them stopping me. As soon as no one could see me, I darted down the hall to Room 136.

My friend was right. There was just a piece of caution tape on the door. The handle was rusted, unlike the shiny brass of the others, and the paint of the door was chipped and falling to pieces.

I opened the door and stepped in. Inside was an old, covered bed with ghostly white bed sheets. The carpet had a rose pattern but was brown and matted from water damage and reeked of something dank and musky. The windows hardly let in any light, too covered in dust and grim. The mirror stood by itself in the corner, a full standing one even taller than I was.

I supposed I could just tell him that I had said the numbers. But I felt compelled to do it having been brave enough to come this far. I sat on the side of the mattress and closed my eyes.

"One," I said.

The distant roar of chatter could still be heard as a mumble. The air here was cold, as though the window didn't quite close right.

"Two,"

"Three,"

This really was silly. My friend hadn't pulled the idea out of nowhere. It was a common rumor that this room was haunted. And that one or two who'd entered had left it screaming.

"Four,"

I felt a tightness in my throat. What if there was something? Or had they just psyched themselves out with this silly number game, just as I was on the verge of doing to myself.

"Five,"

"Six,"

I could've sworn I felt the air get colder. And the mumbling of the guests I don't hear as much anymore, as if they all had decided to stop.

"Seven,"

My skin had started to prickle. I was drawing nearer to the end.

"Eight,"

There was a soft creak of the floor closest to me. I wanted so desperately to open my eyes to make sure no one was standing over me, but I didn't dare.

"Nine,"

I felt something icy on my arm. A cold sensation, dry and sharp, like a finger sliding along my arm. I could hear a sound like a breath in my right ear, as if someone were whispering into it too quietly for me to hear. And just as I was about to say ten, I felt the part of the mattress beside me lower, as if someone were sitting beside me.

I got up and ran from the room. I kept my eyes shut as I did, afraid of what I might see if I looked. And though I lost the dare, and my friends still tease me about it, I'm still happy I didn't count to ten. It makes me shudder to think of what would've happened to me if I had.
