It was Halloween night, and four kids decided to go out for some candy. They were dressed as a vampire, a witch, a ghost, and a zombie. They had a map of the neighborhood, and they planned to hit every house that had a jack-o-lantern on the porch.

They started from their own street, and soon they had a good amount of candy in their bags. They laughed and joked as they walked from door to door, enjoying the spooky decorations and the friendly people who gave them treats.

They reached the end of their street, and looked at their map. They saw that there was one more street to go, and it had a lot of houses with jack-o-lanterns. They decided to go there, even though they had never been there before.

They crossed the road, and entered the new street. They noticed that it was darker and quieter than their own street. There were no street lights, and the houses looked old and creepy. The jack-o-lanterns on the porches flickered with an eerie glow.

They felt a chill in the air, but they shrugged it off. They were brave kids, and they wanted more candy. They walked up to the first house, and rang the bell. No one answered. They tried the next house, and the next one, but it was the same. No one came to the door.

They wondered if anyone lived in this street, or if they had gone out for Halloween. They decided to try one more house, and then go back to their own street. They walked up to the last house on the street, which looked bigger and older than the rest. It had a large jack-o-lantern on the porch, with a wicked smile carved on it.

They rang the bell, and waited. To their surprise, they heard footsteps inside. The door opened slowly, and they saw a man standing there. He was tall and thin, with pale skin and dark eyes. He wore a black suit and a black hat. He smiled at them, showing his sharp teeth.

"Hello, children," he said in a low voice. "I've been expecting you."

The kids felt a surge of fear, but they tried to act normal.

"Trick or treat," they said in unison.

The man chuckled.

"Of course, of course," he said. "Come in, come in. I have plenty of treats for you."

He gestured for them to enter his house.

The kids hesitated, but they saw that he had a large bowl of candy on a table behind him. They thought that maybe he was just trying to be nice, and that he had a weird sense of humor. They decided to go in, just for a minute.

They followed him into his house, which was dark and dusty. They saw cobwebs on the walls, and candles on the tables. They smelled something rotten in the air.

The man led them to a large room at the end of the hall. He opened the door, and invited them in.

"Here we are," he said. "This is where I keep my treats."

The kids entered the room, and gasped in horror.

They saw that the room was filled with human bones and skulls. There were piles of them on the floor, and shelves of them on the walls. There were also jars of eyeballs, hearts, brains, and other organs on a table.

The man closed the door behind them, and locked it.

He turned to them with a wicked grin.

"Welcome to my candy shop," he said. "You are my treats." üç≤

He lunged at them with his claws outstretched.

The kids screamed in terror.
