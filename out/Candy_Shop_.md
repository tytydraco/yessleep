I still have nightmares about that night. The night when we went to the wrong street. The night when we met him. The night when we almost died.

It was Halloween night, and we were having fun. We were four friends, and we loved candy. We dressed up as a vampire, a witch, a ghost, and a zombie. I was the zombie. We had a map of the neighborhood, and we wanted to get as much candy as possible.

We started from our own street, and everything was fine. The people were nice, the decorations were cool, and the candy was sweet. We laughed and joked as we walked from house to house, feeling happy and excited.

We reached the end of our street, and we saw that there was one more street to go. It had a lot of houses with jack-o-lanterns on the porch. We thought that it would be a great place to get more candy. We didn't know that it was a trap.

We crossed the road, and entered the new street. It was dark and quiet. There were no street lights, and the houses looked old and creepy. The jack-o-lanterns on the porches flickered with an eerie glow.

We felt a chill in the air, but we ignored it. We were brave kids, and we wanted more candy. We walked up to the first house, and rang the bell. No one answered. We tried the next house, and the next one, but it was the same. No one came to the door.

We wondered if anyone lived in this street, or if they had gone out for Halloween. We decided to try one more house, and then go back to our own street. We walked up to the last house on the street, which looked bigger and older than the rest. It had a large jack-o-lantern on the porch, with a wicked smile carved on it.

We rang the bell, and waited. To our surprise, we heard footsteps inside. The door opened slowly, and we saw a man standing there. He was tall and thin, with pale skin and dark eyes. He wore a black suit and a black hat. He smiled at us, showing his sharp teeth.

"Hello, children," he said in a low voice. "I've been expecting you."

We felt a surge of fear, but we tried to act normal.

"Trick or treat," we said in unison.

The man chuckled.

"Of course, of course," he said. "Come in, come in. I have plenty of treats for you."

He gestured for us to enter his house.

We hesitated, but we saw that he had a large bowl of candy on a table behind him. We thought that maybe he was just trying to be nice, and that he had a weird sense of humor. We decided to go in, just for a minute.

We followed him into his house, which was dark and dusty. We saw cobwebs on the walls, and candles on the tables. We smelled something rotten in the air.

The man led us to a large room at the end of the hall. He opened the door, and invited us in.

"Here we are," he said. "This is where I keep my treats."

We entered the room, and gasped in horror.

We saw that the room was filled with human bones and skulls. There were piles of them on the floor, and shelves of them on the walls. There were also jars of eyeballs, hearts, brains, and other organs on a table.

The man closed the door behind us, and locked it.

He turned to us with a wicked grin.

"Welcome to my candy shop," he said. "You are my treats."

He lunged at us with his claws outstretched.

We screamed in terror.

I don't remember much after that. I only remember running for my life, dodging his attacks, grabbing a knife from his table, stabbing him in the chest, unlocking the door, escaping from his house, running back to our street, calling for help.

I don't know what happened to him after that. I don't know if he died or not. I don't know if he's still out there or not.

I do know what happened to my friends after that. They didn't make it out alive. They were torn apart by him. They were eaten by him.

I'm the only one who survived that night.

But I wish I didn't.
