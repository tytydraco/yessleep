The upcoming truck was still visible in the rear-view mirror of Martin’s truck.
It wasn’t getting closer, It wasn’t moving away either. It simply remained there, fixed in place.

The key was already inside the ignition. That detail unsettled me more than the truck itself. I couldn’t understand what Martin had been doing so far ahead, or why he had ever needed to hitchhike at all. 

The sequence didn’t fit, it was so confusing.
Martin’s death had hollowed something inside me. After losing him, I had never really believed the highway would spare me either. Standing there, I felt certain this was where it would end. I didn’t fight the thought. I didn’t reach for escape. I closed my eyes instead. I didn’t want to struggle anymore.

I regretted exchanging jobs with Martin. Regretted letting him take that road. After his death, it felt as though I had nudged him towards it, quietly, without knowing. If this was the end, I was ready to let it happen.

But something changed the next moment...

The truck in the rear view mirror didn’t advance. It wasn’t distant or near. It felt held, as if the road itself had decided it would go no further. I stepped out of Martin’s truck. The humming pressed in immediately, heavier than before, dense enough to feel like weight. Martin’s body was still suspended above the ground, but it no longer rotated gently. It spun faster now, very fast and chaotic. The edges looked blurred. The hum thickened and poured through the air, vibrating through my teeth.

I couldn’t look at it for long.

My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I turned and ran back for my truck, however I saw another truck quite distant, standing behind mine, without a second glance I climbed inside my truck. The rear-view mirror no longer showed the road.
It showed a huge billboard.

The road ahead narrowed, collapsed, and ended, as if it had never intended to continue. Left was the only direction left,
when I turned, the image in the mirror changed. A massive billboard rose ahead, empty at first. 

Then fragments appeared; Letters almost formed. words began and fell apart before I could follow them, rewriting and erasing themselves.

The longer I watched, the heavier my head felt. Something inside resisted, pulling inwards. When I reached the billboard, I knew something was wrong, though I couldn’t tell what it was.
Thoughts no longer finished themselves.
They started...got chopped and slipped.
Images came easily, but not words. They arrived late, or not at all. I stayed there longer than I meant to. The voice in my head thinned, stretched, and began to give way.

When the humming returned, I couldn’t tell if it was coming from the road or from me.
It felt too close. As if it were emerging where something else should have been, uneven and persistent.

Martin surfaced in pieces, his smile, the cigarette, out of order, without sequence. The mirror wouldn’t settle. Sometimes it showed a truck rushing towards me, close enough to feel. Sometimes it showed nothing but flicker.
I had no choice left, as usual, but to keep driving. My hands tightened on the steering wheel whenever the mirror pulsed. with each flash, something inside me followed, as though my reflection and my grip were no longer separate things.

After a long while, something familiar flickered ahead.
A lane slipped in and out of existence, unstable, too close. The flicker was faster now, the truck appeared more often, each time heavier and nearer. It should have reached me by now but it didn’t.

That wrongness pressed in harder than the hum. I slowed down and stepped out, the truck behind me was approaching...closer

Instinct broke through whatever hesitation remained. I lunged back inside, grabbing the steering wheel mid motion. The impact came before I was fully in, the truck rammed mine with a crushing force. I was shoved forward, dragged towards the flickering lane as the booth revealed itself in fragments, time began to stutter, the world thickened. I was frozen halfway inside the truck, waiting for something to give.

The booth was breached, followed by the toll attendants who froze and so did the surroundings. 

Everything outside held in place. The pressure didn’t stop. The truck behind me continued to push seamlessly.

Then moments later...I was released.

I was expelled forward, meanwhile sound returned all at once violently. Thought followed just as abruptly, slamming back into place. The truck that pushed me out was expelled too.

Men surrounded my truck, voices overlapped. Then the highway patrol approached... It was too much to process all of a sudden...too many sounds that were too sharp..too loud for my ears that had not heard anything for hours. They collided inside my head without order, I couldn’t process any of it.

My eyes drifted upwards, caught on the billboard ahead. The language on it was foreign. I stared at it longer than I should have, knowing without understanding that whatever had been taken from me hadn’t returned whole.
