A boy named Filip Bergström in 6B became our first centurion. He recruited some of his classmates to his cohort and one of his childhood friends. None of them knew anything about hacking, so we had to lean more on psychological strategies than technological ones. We gave his cohort a number of files—which we called weapons—and then instructed them to basically catfish whoever we considered bad into accepting the file transfers. At this time, people weren’t particularly smart with their computers, and the number of targets they succeeded in “nuking” was impressive.

This early on, it was only Julia and me who decided on the targets. We decided that we would focus on groups that were easy to identify and trick into opening our files and landed on game cheaters, neo-Nazis, and online predators. We spent a lot of time in different chat rooms pretending to be either fascists or little girls, and as soon as someone exposed themselves to us, we sent their information to Filip and his men.

My dad was as always oblivious to what was happening on the screen when I sat hunched over the computer in my room. He couldn’t even imagine the world that had opened up in front of me. He was just happy that I seemed to be doing so much better since meeting Julia and joining what he thought was nothing more than an online club for amateur computer programmers. Little did he know that his son was now the commander of a legion of cyber-warriors. In fact, it was something I couldn’t really imagine myself. It all just seemed like a game. But as the days went by and the list of targets we took down grew, I started to realize that this was something more real than anything I had ever done before.

A culture slowly developed over our online chats. It felt natural, and to a certain extent it was, but most of it was Julia’s invention. It began with the Latinization of our names. Some remained the same, such as Julia, but most didn’t. Filip, for example, became Filippus and I became Benius. Next came the jargon. Instead of “hi” we wrote “salve,” and Julia insisted that everyone saluted me and herself as Dominus or Imperator. The members were quick to adopt this online language, and just as Julia had predicted, our secret way of talking to each other, albeit only online, formed a sense of unity between us.

During sixth grade, our online legion grew quickly. Additional centurions from other classes and even from other schools recruited more and more legionaries to their cohorts. It was fascinating to see more and more people on my ICQ list adding their ranks and titles to their names. Julia made a beautifully detailed ASCII eagle standing on a banner with the following text: “Legio nulla. Ad victoriam.” We added this as a boot-up message on all the computers at school and also to our digital arsenal so that it became the last thing our targets saw on their screens before they got nuked. So far, the teachers had no idea about what was happening, and the ones who heard about it dismissed it as nothing more than a game.

At the end of sixth grade, during the summer of 1997, Oliver made another attempt at returning to the old ways where he was on top and I was on the bottom. He didn’t know what was happening online since he viewed everything that could be perceived as nerdy as a threat to his popularity. All he saw were the dynamics at school, and although he had seen the ASCII eagle on the computer screens and had heard of Legion Zero, he couldn’t fully grasp what it meant. To this day, I couldn’t even fathom it myself.

Oliver still had his close friends, but their authority among the other pupils was diminishing by the day and I suppose he had had enough on this particular day. He bumped into me on purpose in the canteen on a day when Julia wasn’t there to see it. It was one of the many excuses he had used before to harass me. He tackled me pretty hard, and I fell to the ground. My glasses slid over the floor, making it difficult for me to see.

“Watch where you’re going,” he said with his sadistic smile. “Fucking *idiot*.”

A great weight pressed down on my chest and a sharp pain erupted in my side. I couldn’t breathe. Oliver was sitting on me, his hands at my throat. A few strands of hair escaped their tie and fell over his face. I tried to cry out, but no sound came. I was struggling to breathe and the pain in my side was getting worse. For a moment, albeit only in my mind, I was back in third grade when Oliver had been King of the Playground and I had been at his mercy.

But the moment didn’t last long. Oliver let go of my neck. I tried to squint my eyes to see what was happening. Chairs moved across the floor. People were standing up from their tables. The voices that used to join in on Oliver’s malice now spelled sentences such as “leave him alone” and, perhaps more remarkable, “Stay back, you fucking vandal!” There was a short commotion. Oliver was pushed to the ground and his friends were held back. Everything was still blurry around me, but I managed to stand up. A boy in fourth grade handed me my glasses. I put them on and saw that over fifteen people had gathered around us to protect me. Filip was one of them. He held his foot on Oliver’s chest. So far, our militaristic jargon had been limited to online conversations. This was the first time that changed. Breathing heavily from the short fight, Filip said, “Dominus, what should we do with him?”

I stared at Filip, trying to comprehend the insanity of the situation.

“Centurion!” It was Julia’s voice, coming from behind me. “Let go of him before the teachers get here.”

Filip did as he was told, and Oliver rushed up to his feet.

“Salve, Dominus,” Filip said when she arrived and put his fist on his chest. The others followed with the same salute.

Oliver and his friends, mad with fury, looked at Julia as if awaiting her judgment.

“The question isn’t what we should do with them,” Julia said. “The question is what they should do for us.” She turned to Oliver. “You can’t fight this,” she said. “Join the legion, and you and your friends will matter more than you could ever imagine.”

A week later, Oliver became Olivarius—the tenth centurion of the legion. He recruited his friends to his cohort. I expressed my concerns about this to Julia, but she said that it was necessary for the next step, which was to move some of our activities offline.

As usual, there was some downtime during summer break since most of the pupils went on vacation with their parents, but Julia and I worked as hard as ever. Our biggest issue was that we had too many members in relation to the number of targets we could find, leading to a lot of members lacking something to do. To solve this problem, we built an online report book where members could receive orders and publish mission reports. Julia named it Castrum. We also created a cohort whose sole job was to find new targets and publish them in the report book.

During the summer, Julia also began talking about something she called “anti-docility training.” The idea was that each centurion had to do at least one offline mission together with their cohort to establish a sense of bravery and readiness. When I asked what we were readying them for, she simply said, “The challenges of the future, Dominus.”

In seventh grade, an addition to the official salute to higher-ranking officers was introduced. Members now had to extend their arm upward, facing toward their superior, with their palms slightly down in a relaxed manner. When the teachers caught a glimpse of this, they understandably conflated it with the similar fascist salute and began talking to pupils about the legion, trying to figure out what it was exactly and who had created it. Shortly after, Julia and I were forced to go to the principal’s office. The principal was there with one of the school’s history teachers.

“We have zero tolerance for neo-Nazis at this school,” the principal said. “And now we’re seeing a lot of our students doing Hitler salutes to each other! That’s against the law nowadays. Did you know that? Just recently they introduced something called a *hate crime*.”

The principal mostly looked at me with her concerned eyes, unable to understand how a good and innocent girl such as Julia could be responsible for something like this.

“I brought Josef here,” she said and nodded toward the history teacher, “so that he can explain the historical context.”

Julia remained quiet, which made me nervous. Josef began explaining why Nazism was bad, and even brought up his own family history. That’s when Julia finally spoke:

“Can’t you tell the difference between a Nazi salute and a *Roman* salute? We aren’t national socialists for crying out loud.” Julia looked genuinely embarrassed for them. “We’re taking back these symbols from the fascists. Legion Zero isn’t some twentieth-century ideology! It’s based on an idea much older than that, the only idea that can save mankind from destroying itself through decadence and mind-numbing docility! If you’ve truly studied history, you should understand. The end point of capitalism is nothing more than nihilistic hedonism, and you can’t build a long-lived civilization on that. You just can’t!”

They looked at Julia, dumbfounded. The principal didn’t know what to say and didn’t seem to believe what she had just heard. After a few moments, Josef asked:

“What idea are you talking about, Julia?”

“The idea of Rome!”

Not much happened after this, except we tried to hide our activities from the teachers a bit more carefully. The teachers did contact her parents, though, and expressed their concerns with Julia’s way of thinking. During this time, the legion was at its peak, and the activity on Castrum increased every day. Julia worked hard on implementing new features to the site, such as the ability to create chat rooms and have a list of contacts so that we wouldn’t have to use ICQ anymore, but ever since the day her parents were informed her mood seemed a bit off. It was like a deep sadness had taken a hold of her without letting go. This is where my memories also become fuzzy, something my therapist tells me is a result of repression. The last clear memory I have from this time is the night Julia called me in tears. She begged me to come to her place. I had never been to her house before, and I thought it was a big deal that she finally invited me over even if it wasn’t under the best of circumstances.

I took the bus to her neighborhood. The rain was pouring down heavily, and I remember feeling a sense of dread as I walked toward Diplomatstaden, one of the wealthiest areas in the city and home of many embassies and ambassadorial residencies. Just walking on these streets made me feel out of place and, somehow, for every step I took toward Julia’s home it felt as if I was getting further and further away from her. I eventually found her house, a large white villa with a well-manicured lawn, and rang the doorbell. I remember being so nervous that my heart was racing and I could feel the blood pulsing in my temples.

I heard her father yelling from outside the door. He was speaking Italian. Her mother seemed to try and calm him down. Julia, who must have seen me through the peephole, opened the door and let me in. Her mascara formed black rivers down her cheeks. Her dad was yelling from the kitchen. The only light in the living room came from the TV. A game of soccer was on. I had to step carefully not to tip over any of the beer cans on the floor. Her mother, also in the kitchen, was crying now. The old beer left a stinky aroma in the air, a smell that always brings this particular memory to my mind. I hadn’t seen this kind of misery before. On our way to Julia’s room, I saw a few framed photographs on a dresser. Her family looked happy in them, at least on the ones with four people instead of just three. Her dad yelled something extra loud to which Julia yelled back:

“Testa di cazzo!”

Her room wasn’t as messy as the rest of the house. On the contrary, it was almost sterile. She sat down on her large bed while I inspected her IKEA bookshelf, too nervous to sit down next to her. She owned all the volumes of *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* and the entire *Foundation* series by Isaac Asimov. There were also a few VHS tapes such as *Starship Troopers*, *Babe,* and the Swedish romantic drama *Vinterviken*.

“T-These are some good movies,” I said, feeling like an idiot.

“Can you sit down, please?”

I swallowed loudly, trying to hide the rapid beating of my heart, and did as I was told.

She said something I didn’t quite understand, something about having to make a big decision that she wasn’t ready to share with me yet, and that it would change everything. Not just our lives, but the entire world. I didn’t know what to say, and just stuttered something unhelpful about how good she had been to me and that she didn’t have to doubt herself. Shortly after that, I received my first and last kiss. To this day I can still feel, not just hear, the warm whisper that followed in my ear:

“Our love will conquer the world.”

After this, all I remember are fragments: the cohorts marching up and down the schoolyard; the school choir singing a hymn that I only hear in my dreams but never remember when I wake up; the ASCII eagle put on an actual flag; the blood on the ground after the inexplicable jump from the roof of the school; Julia, dead in my arms… And after all that came the funeral, the collapse of the legion a few months later, and the return of the bullying just as if nothing had happened at [all](https://www.reddit.com/r/tobiasmalm/comments/112r4le/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another/).
