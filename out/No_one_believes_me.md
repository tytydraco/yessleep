I was told, or more like demanded, to keep this journal by my therapist, of course. If anything is to come from this, I hope she believes me, I hope this convinces her, or just someone, that last Thursday wasn't my fault, it was self-defense, that they believe me for once that this isn't me going mad but a torment that's gone on too long. If I write about this too much, I'm going to get emotional. I need to breathe, I need a break.

I'm on the way home right now, and my parents are driving of course, I wish they didn't have t;o it makes me feel small, insignificant, like a child, witch is how they treat me now so I guess that shall never change, not now not anymore, i lost the privilege of a normal life, I lost the privilege of being an adult it feels like. 



As I stepped from the car, my feet placed on the hot tar driveway, I looked up to the building I called home, it was a 3-story apartment building with each of 6 buildings in the front having padoes, some were lined with fluorescent lights and others bare, looking up to mine witch had several different flowers blooming in the beginning of summer my heart sunk they were all dead, it might be a little thing to many, but to me they were my children I had taken them in during winter, and had them for 3 years now it was rough to see, never the less I had to pravale out of the car to the building witch I had dreaded for the last week or so. 



My stepfather had already gotten out of the driver's seat and stood in front of me, lending a hand, and I had gotten up by myself. He glared my way for a second, but as soon as my mother spoke, he lightened up.

 “Oh dear, we will miss you. Please remember to call us if you need anything.” 

With a smile to light up a village plastered onto her face, I was having none of this. 

“Will you throw me into a kook house again or maybe something more permanent this time?” She was truly a good woman, but I just wasn't ready to forgive yet, or maybe ever. My stepfather looked startled by this outburst.

 “Come on, dear, you know we wish the best for are little girl.”

 It was just furious at this point, but I had finally looked at my father and saw the suitcase in his other hand. Grabbing the duffle off the ground of the car and snatching the bag from my father, I stormed off. Looking back, 

“You both know it should be son, and you chose to say that purposely, you're both dead to me now, until you wish to accept and believe me.” 

Tears welded my eyes shut, making my vision blurred. I was able to clumsily open the door to the building, and tracing the way to the apartment that I've walked so many times before, I made it to the door, and dropping everything to the floor, I was reduced to tears. 



As I lie, I wonder what they would think, the thousand eyes that lay upon me, if this is just another fit of the mentally unwell man or just someone who’s seen the truth of this world. The truth hides the evils that lie dormant in are minds that we dare not act upon, but I know them and I've seen them, I've experienced them, the pain and torture that they bring to the unwilling peristispiences the ones that must experience the mad of man, but thats just a fantasy that they could understand the pain I feel, I know it to be in my heart that no one knows what ive been through. 



I had collected myself after of eternity on that nasty, cold carpet. The cold was new to me, though, all I've felt for a while was the unbearable heat of this world, so to have a change of pace was a gift upon god himself, even if it included the musty smells. Even if this all were to be true and I had nothing more than to wish to stay on that ground, I knew what must be done, I must face my dreams, “that's what I fought so hard for, right?”. As my hand shivered, I persevered on and reached out to the door that lay dormant so long. 



The air was something more than stale; it was a rot of some kind, maybe meat, but I don't eat meat. No matter where the stench had come from, I would find it soon enough. Looking around the room, it was more disordered than not. There had been nearly nothing of its original place, and I felt more ginger built up now, knowing that my brother was supposed to take care of it, and he had left it so dingy. All I wish to find and locate is the one companion that has never left or betrayed me, yet Usag, my cat. As I went into the house slowly and steadily, I peered over the obstacles of grime that had been left for me to exterminate. I called once “Usagi”. Then again, “Usagi” still nothing. The fear that I may be calling and something more my apper had come to my thoughts, but I knew the fear to be pointless, whether I was correct and my end was soon, or it was nothing but my own mind to fear. 



My hands then sank deep into a pile I had wished to be only clothes, but their smell told me otherwise. Then I had them thrown aside, and to the wall they found their new lying spot. Shaking my hand trying to get off the gunk that once lay dormant in that pile, now temporarily attached to my hand, but as I shook, nothing came off, nothing. Rubbing my hand down on the couch, still trying to detach it from my hand, my hand ran up and down it, trying to get it all off, back and forth I went. Fast, I went back and forth, and the burning started. Then, faster, it still wasn't off, so I had to go faster, but it wasn't off yet. A gash had started to form, and the pain trickled in, but it wasn't off, and it needed to be OFF. So I chose to go faster till blood started to form spots around the coach, but I could still feel the grime, so I had no choice but to keep going back and forth. The pain was getting noticeable, but I didn't stop,

 “ I deserve this, no?” I kept going 

“They said I love it, no?”,

 “They said the pain was temporary, no?” Tears were welling in my eyes by now, I didn't stop thinking because if I needed to feel something, anything at this point, all I felt was guilt. Shivers were running up my spine, but no matter what, I kept going back and forth on the coach. My hand was nothing more than a bloody mess at this point, and I kept going. I didn't feel clean, no, not yet. Till nothing, I blacked out.

Waking up, I felt nothing but pain now, my hand was bleeding because I couldn't see through the blood that covered my face. I had gotten up, still blind to the world, but willing to try to make it to the bathroom even if there were new obstacles in my way now. I moved slowly and tripped quite a few times, but was slowly making it. I had felt my hand a few times on the way, and it was cut up pretty badly. A wound that was about the size of a golf ball had formed. All I could do was feel at that time, and the size of the cuts was all I could think of, other than the pain. I had finally trudged my way through the house only nearly falling a handful of times. I had gotten rags and such to get myself in order. With the gauze around my hand and head, I could finally stop the bleeding from protruding from the once-temple I called my body.



I had made it back to the scene of the crime and looked around with a wet rag. Washing up any blood splots that had been left was difficult, but with a bit of time, I got it done. It had been clear I had fallen either on the wall or the coach, then gravity overtook my body, my head went flying back onto the table, slicing it open. 



Then the manhunt continued onwards. Looking under the coach now, which had been my objective of moving that pile, I had seen no sign of a cat ever being there. Laughing to myself, realizing there truly had been no point to that at all. I then made it off to the other famous landmarks of the beast. 



The next hours were a blur for me, nothing but frantic searching. The last stop had come up to me, my bedroom. There had been many reasons that I had not gone back till now, but mainly it was the guilt I felt. With the last of my heart, I reached out for the door. And letting my hand rest on the doorknob like I'd had before coming into this place that I once called a home, there had been no feeling of the cold this time do to the bandages. Nevertheless, I slowly opened the door room. The overwhelming smell of rot filled my nose once more, and it made me think back to a simpler time before. Looking around the room, I saw the body still lying down by the end of the bed. It seemed to be untouched by time and set in a spiral of stasis, never to be let out. The bite mark on his neck was a clear indicator of the area that had caused the man's untimely demise. Still in the same plaid shirt, too stained with red by now, clearly from the open wound that had been inflicted by the monster. 

After walking up to the man and kneeling to be eye level, it seemed to be truly unable to return this time. I knew this was just a hope then, as I do know, though. Slowly stroking the man's hair, feeling the ridges in his unfurled eyebrows made by a lifetime of anger and discussed by the world. I felt guled to stay there for the rest of my time, but I knew I must complete what I had come here for. 



After what had felt like a century for us, I moved over to the side of my bed to peer underneath. Looking under, I thought I saw an outline of something, but I wasn't sure. Then a pair of green eyes had appeared from the depths of the darkness. Reaching a hand out to grab the friend I'd missed so much.

 “Usagi, come to Dad, please,”  I said in a raspy tone, like it had been days since I uttered my last words. 

Then like magic, he came into my arms. Fast, though a bit too fast. Then I realized there had been another pair of eyes, blue ones, staring at me. I had scooped up my child into my arms and was trying to rush out of there, slamming my head in the process onto the wooden beams that lay above me. I had gotten out of the underside of my bed, but knew the figure had been and would be to me soon. Tears started to well in my eyes, covering my vision temporarily, wiping my eyes of the red and watery substance that had formed on my face, I realized part of the bandage had come off too. Holding my cat in my arms, I attempted to get up and run out of there, but I had been thrown back down just as fast. The creature that we deemed to be a man had thrown me back down to the ground, and as I lay there, I squeezed my cat harder, but he had been latched onto me just as I was onto him. 

“You know, sweety, you look better with a smile, right?” The greasy and waxed-filled hand had glazed over my lips to force a smile onto me. The touch made me feel more used than most anyone else could wish to accomplish. 

“Please just let me be you fucking monster.” 	Tears were forming more in my eyes now.

“Got a bad, nasty bo bo don't y? a” 	The thing's hands glazed over my forehead before landing on the cut. His fingernail dug into the cut, exposing the wet slop of veins and blood that lay dormant in my head, but still I lay frozen in fear as the pain started to emanate from my heart.d

“So beautiful you are, truly you are more adorable by the day.” his hands digging out of the wound made it feel so much worse. After he stopped touching me, I attempted to run away once more, this time trying to jump over the bed to escape. While I had made it most of the way over, my foot was grabbed and pulled back once more.

“NO DAUGHTER OF MINE COULD BE AS DISRESPECTFUL TO THEIR FATHER.”	Daring me back towards him, I could see the anger in his eyes as he just spat on my face after daring me back to him.

“Disgraceful you are.” We looked eye to eye for what had felt like years once again. Felling a million sharp spines digging in my skin after he touched my shoulder, rubbing it up and down. There, of course, was no real spine, but just the touch was too much for me. 

“You will never think of me as the man I've become, will you?”	 A disgusted look came on the thing's face, into a divine-looking smile formed.

“You have been so much more to me than a child, though,” As he unwrapped the cloth around my free hand and licked the cut that had formed. As his tongue went up my arm, I felt nothing but vomit forming in my mouth, and I discussed.

“I shouldn't feel guilty for an animal like you.” He head-butted him and kicked him to the wall. The blood was forming once more, from the pressure being off for so long by now. I had by now gotten up and was getting out of the room, with a bed between us, I knew I could make it to the door first. Then, as I stood up to move, something grabbed my leg from under the bed. Kicking it off, I ran to and out the door. Looking back, I had seen him still passed out on the ground from hitting his head. I knew, though, if I were to ever return from the room, he'd be on the floor again. 



I made it back to the other side of the door, knowing that as long as it stayed shut, the demons that lay deep within would never come back out.
