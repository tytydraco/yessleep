He had been dead for three or four days. I was riding into El Paso when I saw the telltale circle of vultures.


With the carrion-starved scavengers circling above me, I made my way off the trail and towards the dried riverbed they were suspended above. The rancid miasma of rot greeted me warmly as I descended the subtle slope of the bank. I walked a few more feet, and I saw him, slumped against a black rock.


I knew he was dead as soon as I could smell him, but my eyes confirmed visually what I already knew. The soil beneath the man had already gluttonously imbibed the man’s spilled blood, leaving only a thin and delicate film over the darkened patch. The man's hat obscured his face, but the pallid color of his hands was telling.


I decided to investigate closer, as I felt, one way or another, this was going to fall into my lap. The law is unable to tame the wild fury of both human and nature. And this is where both bloom without oversight.


I was a lawman once. Hell, it was decades ago. A little town called Drywell. Families, children, travelers—the town was home to many and a pleasant stop for the rest. It was an unseasonably cold day in May. The normal bustle of the town square outside the window of my quarters was noticeably absent that morning.


I stumbled out of the run-down little office onto the dusty dirt road. The silence was deafening and suggested something sinister. Small heaps dotted the road and porches of town, seemingly at random.


The stench of the decaying cowpoke in front of me forcefully shoved me out of my reverie. The rock on which the man took his permanent repose caught my attention. It was tall and cast an imposing shadow, like a twisted sundial. The surface of the rock was glossy and tinted a dark red over its slick, void-like surface. In the shadow of the obelisk lay a leather-bound book, its parchment pages dancing in the gentle breeze, edges tinted a rusty hue.


I stooped to retrieve the book, but when my fingers brushed against its cover, everything around me was cold. It passed in an instant, but I swear I could see my breath linger on the air.


I walked back to Slow Dancer, my horse, and slid the book into a saddlebag. I couldn't waste any more time here. I did my damnedest to remember landmarks so I could return later, as I was sure I'd need to.


There was a tiny village called Vandergross Grove on the way to El Paso, and I travel light. The necessity to stop was evident. The hours passed uneventfully as Slow Dancer navigated the neglected path. By the time night fell, I could see the village's silhouette against the cloudy night sky.


Things seemed off as I rode in. Even in the pitch dark, one could expect to hear the patrons of the local watering hole. Not a single lantern was lit, not a single person occupied the very lived-in locale.


There was something in the air, something subtle. It reminded me of something I couldn't place. It was putrid, but maybe a little sweet.


As I composed myself, I found myself drawn to one of the small heaps in the road. The sun was aggressively cascading down from the heavens and was rather blinding against the drab road. I was about three feet away when I realized the heap was a small pile of clothes, folded neatly.


The stench creeping from the center of town was alluring beyond an investigative aspect. Something was there, and it wanted to be seen. I steeled myself and followed the obvious path to the town's namesake well.


The circular stone portal into the earth stood agelessly among the sun-bleached timber of surrounding buildings. Over the top of the well, a few small branches poked out at various angles. The smell was strong here and nearly intoxicating.


I sauntered up to the well, being pulled by the miasma of rot. They weren't branches at all—the limbs cresting the well were human. Arms, legs, hands, and feet, piled with no concern, filling the entirety of the well.


My eyes snapped open, having linked the smell with certainty to my memory of Drywell. The implication was impossible to ignore. Vandergross Grove fell just like Drywell.


I felt a smile quickly flash across my face, much to my surprise. The smell seemed to be emanating from the local church. I slowly swung the door open and promptly vomited on my boots.


Within the church lay perhaps sixty or seventy people of all descriptions, heaped on top of one another. The horrendous mountain stood motionless, radiating a stench of baked viscera.


As the initial disgust subsided, a new emotion took shape. It was pride. Indescribable, but unmistakable. I walked hurriedly back to Slow Dancer, who was still hitched to a post outside the church.


Without thinking, I frantically dug for the book. After producing it, I rifled through the pages as if they'd offer some explanation. The page I opened the book to had three words on it: that was you.


I knew what they meant. I don't know how, but it was the simplest thing to me. It made sense. I rode back to the riverbed as fast as Slow Dancer could manage. The sun was rising as I slipped down the bank once again.


Without slowing or hesitation, I quickly walked to the rotting man. In a swift motion, I grabbed his hat by the brim and flung it across the dried brook. I staggered at what I saw and what it suggested.


The first few were very easy. They just fell right down to the bottom. It's convenient the well is dry; there's nothing to float on. When I got to about twenty-five down the well, I had to start using force to shove them down.
