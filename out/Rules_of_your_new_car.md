I finally had enough money in the bank to be able to afford the car of my dreams, a glossy red Ferrari 296 GTB. However I did buy it from a somewhat strange car dealer. I’d never seen the building before yet suddenly it appeared near my town. I thought nothing of this and only focused on the amazing prices.

I bought the car and begun to drive away and only just heard over the roar of the engine, the wrinkled, old slightly, strange, dealer yell,
“Check the passenger seat!”
I looked to my left and saw a small piece of paper. I pulled the car over and picked up the paper wondering how I never noticed it.

The slip read in a scrawled handwriting:

So you’ve just bought yourself a new Ferrari, congratulations. However there are some rules you must follow if you wish to keep this car along with your life.
1. If you run a yellow light pat the passenger seat next to you, he doesn’t like risky drivers.
2. If the air conditioning turns on without you telling it to, do not turn it off until you leave the car.
3. If you need to refill gas don’t take more than 10 minutes, he doesn’t like to be kept waiting.
4. Never drive with your headlights on between 11:47 pm and 4:26 am.
5. If you have anyone else in the car they must sit in the back seats.
5a. If the back seats are full they may use the passenger seat however they must apologise at least once every 13 minutes for stealing his seat, but no more than 3 times in 22 minutes.
6. If you hear tapping on the window wind it down wait 10 seconds then wind it back up.
6a. If someone is sat in the passenger DO NOT WIND DOWN THE WINDOW.
7. If the car stops moving for no reason, RUN you have displeased him.
8. If any rule is broken RUN, except for rule 1, you still have time to pat the seat.
Enjoy your new car!

I laughed off the note thinking it was just a stupid prank but still felt I should keep it for some subconscious reason. I continued my drive home and rejoined the roads of my town. At the last set of traffic lights however, I saw they were about to change so accelerated. What I didn’t notice was the light was yellow. 

Suddenly a low guttural cry started echoing through the car and rising in pitch. I panicked and fumbled in my pocket for the note before patting the seat next to me. Then as suddenly as it started the cry stopped. When I made it home (although quite shaken) I studied the note carefully. After a while I became accustomed to the rules off the car. My friends thought it was strange but I had grown to get used to them and whoever or whatever the strange creature was.

One day I went to the bar with some friends and got quite drunk. I shouldn’t have been driving but I was blasting music and loving life so I didn’t care. Unfortunately because of the music I didn’t hear the three very distinct taps on my window.
