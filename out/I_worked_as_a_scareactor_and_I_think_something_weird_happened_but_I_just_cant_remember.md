From the little I've read, a lot of stuff in this sub seems pretty intense and I'm not sure how much I believe most of it, but I can't think of somewhere else to post this story. I hope you don't find it too underwhelming.

&#x200B;

First of all, I don't want to discourage anyone reading from becoming a scarer; its probably the most fun I've ever had at a job, and with most of us actors being queer and/or disabled, it was an extremely accepting and accommodating environment.

&#x200B;

Now, let's get into the story:

&#x200B;

So last year I auditioned as a scare actor at a local attraction; it's no Halloween Horror nights, but it had rides, nine haunts, roaming actors, and seems to be pretty big in my city and the surrounding area (I had only just moved here, but everyone I know had been at least once).I made it through the group interview, and was told to come to the training day. There were a lot of people there-- front of house, managers, swings, makeup people, and (of course) actors. Many of the actors were returning from previous seasons, some older ones even wearing ten-year ennamel pins, but even then, I was one of fifty-or-so new hires.

The first training day included an introduction from my new bosses, a massive powerpoint of trivia, basic information, and blown-up versions of the wavers and contracts we were signing for those hard-of-sight. Luckily, all the presentations we were given were put on the work facebook, so I'll be citing that since my memory's a bit spotty lately.First, they welcomed us new recruits, saying that this was their biggest intake in recent history (Pause for cheers). They seperated us and paired up houses by location, gaving us rundowns of what we would be doing during training (break for water and inter-catagory icebreakers).

Finally, they brought us together again to discuss storytelling and lore stuff. I'm not sure how much I can say, we had NDAs to avoid spoiling the opening ceremonies, but basically, the fan-favorite mascot was being replaced with a new one portrayed by a veteran scarer. Apparently the previous actor's performance had been so unique and transformational, that no one else could fill his shoes, meaning that the character (Who we'll call 'old splicer') was being retired.The lore was that he was mutated while toying with the canister's in one of the famous Haunts (We'll call it Metrica Medicum) and was mutated into the new mascot. It was all pretty cheesy, but very fun all the same.

Next they showed us some of the masks-- hideous, beautifully crafted silicone faces worth thousands each. I worked as a masked character for the latter half of the season so I can confirm those things are valuable: hair pins and eating in it are banned, and you can't even put it on or remove it without supervision. They're also heavy and wet and make you break out like crazy, but that's just a personal gripe; objectively, they're incredibly life like and creepy.

&#x200B;

The first actual training day we had was called 'scare school', a new protocol they were beta testing this year. My group started with the 90 minute seminar on healthy screaming, lead by a heavy metal vocalist. Next, we had an improv workshop and a set/prop safety overview, but I don't remember much of those. However, our personal-health-and-safety workshop had a documented presentation I could find: we started with social safety and communication, then mental and emotional health, which included a "Me Vs. My Character" worksheet, and another about grounding ourselves so we won't dissociate in costume. Finally, we went over physical health stuff (Eg: calling in sick, sleeping 8 hours, wearing shoes with arch support, and not ODing on energy drinks which is very prevalent issue in the profession).

There's also powerpoint slide here about 'religion and identity health', but as cool as that sounds, it's just about brushing it off when scared guests call you abomination or hurl slurs at you while in costume.

&#x200B;

The first night of work was insane, hoards of actors getting masked and made up, chugging pre-workout and doing emergency costume repairs. The whole thing was a blur, the fog machines that filled the park flooded into the hairspray-stinking dressing room, the other newbies and I were super nervous, and supervisors yelled over the chatter and music for their groups to circle up. I was tying my boots, sat next to Jacob-- the veteran scarer from earlier, who was promoted to the new mascot actor-- he was in the older demographic of actors.

I don't remember clearly, but this is my approximation of our conversation:

&#x200B;

"Hey kid, you excited?"

I confirmed. "Is it always this crazy?"

"First night's always crazy." He said, a few costumers bustling around us-- I remember they kept tripping on me.

"Are you excited to be playing the CRYSPER?" I asked while he was forcing his head through the tight neck canal of the mask.

"Well, yeah." He said, voice probably muffled by the mask-- they do that quite a lot, even on the off change they actually fit you. "I miss Gerry, we worked together on a lot of projects, I don't think I could ever live up to his Splicer."

"Gerry was the old actor?"

"Yeah, He was a great man. Great actor too, but he seriously disappeared when he played Splicer. He was like a whole other person under the mask." Someone called five minutes to Opening Scarimonies, Jacob smacked the side of my head and said, with his in-character vocal-fry.  "Break everyone's legs, kid. seeya after." (I remember that bit with clarity.)

&#x200B;

That was the last time we talked in costume. I saw him before work every night and we would chat a lot before we masked up, mostly about about panic buttons and rowdy guests we'd heard about from the clowns.

I only just put together that I don't remember talking to Jacob with his mask on, and since I last saw him in costume during group photos (he didn't come for end-of-season drinks with the rest of us) I wonder how he's been doing. He's still on the FB but hasn't answered any of my PMs. I asked some of his long-time acting buddies and they haven't seen him cast in anything lately.

I made it through group interviews again this year. My carpool from last season's been promoted to a Supervisor, She's going to check the cast list when it goes up to let me know if he's returning this season.

Sorry if this isn't as scary as some of the other stuff here, I just thought it was weird and wanted to share
