I should’ve trusted my gut the moment the road turned from gravel to dirt.
By then the GPS had stopped, my phone was dead, and the sun had started melting behind the trees. The deeper I drove, the quieter it became—no birds, no wind, not even the hum of insects. Just the tires crunching through a tunnel of pine.

The cabin appeared suddenly at the end of the trail, slumped between the trees like it had been dropped there and forgotten. Its wood was gray and swollen from rain, the windows dark as blind eyes. A sheet of paper was nailed to the door. The ink looked new, as if someone had written it moments before I arrived.

	1.	Arrive before sunset.
	2.	Lock the door twice.
	3.	Don’t look out the windows after midnight.
	4.	If you hear footsteps on the porch between 2 and 3 a.m., say your name backward.
	5.	Never speak your real name out loud.
	6.	If the fire goes out on its own, leave immediately.
	7.	Ignore the whistling in the morning.
	8.	Put this note back when you leave.

⸻

I laughed when I read it. Probably just a local ghost story meant to spook renters. Inside, the place smelled of ash and wet wood. I started a fire, unpacked, and sat down to canned food by the flickering light.

By midnight the forest was silent again—unnaturally silent. The air felt thick, as if sound itself had been swallowed. The fire snapped and spat sparks, but even that seemed muffled.

Then, somewhere outside, boards creaked. Slow. Measured. Coming closer.

I froze, listening.
Three knocks followed—deep, deliberate.

The rules flashed in my mind: If you hear footsteps on the porch between 2 and 3 a.m., say your name backward.
I whispered it, the syllables trembling out of me.

The sound stopped.

For a long moment there was nothing but the soft crackle of the fire. Then, right beside the door, came a breath. Wet, uneven.
And a voice—my own—whispering my name correctly this time.

Every muscle in my body locked. I didn’t move. The doorknob twitched once and went still. Something brushed against the window. I couldn’t help it—I looked.

A shape stood in the clearing.
Tall and thin, its limbs too long, its joints bending slightly the wrong way. Skin pale as bark stretched tight over its frame, the surface rippling like something alive beneath it. Where eyes should’ve been were two black hollows, wet and glistening. When it inhaled, a thin slit opened sideways across its face, releasing a low, wheezing whistle.

It tilted its head toward the cabin, listening. Then it whispered my name again, the sound leaking from its throat like air escaping a crack in stone.

I dropped to the floor, heart hammering, eyes squeezed shut. The fire flared, then dimmed to embers. I waited there until the faint gray of morning crept through the cracks in the wall.

When I finally looked up, the window was fogged. Words were drawn in the moisture:

“You didn’t breathe.”

I ran. Outside, the note on the door was gone—replaced by another in the same hand:

⸻

Rules for the Next Guest
	1.	If you hear whistling at dawn, don’t follow it.
That means the last one didn’t make it out.

⸻

I jumped into the car, hands shaking, engine screaming to life. The dirt road twisted back toward civilization, but the fog rose fast, wrapping the woods in gray.

That’s when the whistling started again—faint at first, then close. It came from the passenger seat.

My pulse hammered. The seat beside me was empty, but the air shimmered, bending the light. I glanced in the mirror.

Something pale crouched in the back seat, its head tilted, neck jerking in short, stiff motions. The hollows where its eyes should be caught the faint light and seemed to pull everything in.

The world spun. I remember trees flashing by, glass shattering, the sound of metal twisting—then darkness.

⸻

They found the car three days later, engine still running, door open. The windshield was covered in fingerprints—all pointing outward.
The cabin was empty. The rules were gone.

A week later, hikers found a new sheet of paper nailed to a tree at the edge of the forest
The Cabin Rules — Part II

(The Next Guest)

I wasn’t planning to stay.
I didn’t even know there was a cabin out here.

I came for the hike — three days alone in the forest to clear my head. The trail markers were faded, the map useless, but the quiet was what I wanted. That kind of silence that feels like it presses on your ears.

By the second afternoon, fog started to crawl through the trees. It came low to the ground at first, then rose until the trunks looked like pillars holding up nothing. The compass spun. My phone showed no signal.

That’s when I saw the paper.

It was nailed to a pine tree, half-torn, edges fluttering in the still air. The handwriting was jagged, uneven, like someone had written in a hurry.

⸻

Rules for Staying in the Woods
	1.	If you hear your name whispered from behind you, don’t turn around.
That means it remembers you.

⸻

At first, I laughed. Creepy joke. Probably from some camper trying to scare tourists. I took a picture of it anyway — something to show friends later.

The light started to fade faster than it should have. By the time I realized it, the forest had gone silent in that same unnatural way — no wind, no rustle, no birds. Just stillness.

I turned in circles, trying to find the trail again, but every direction looked the same. My stomach tightened. The fog had swallowed the path completely.

That’s when I heard it.

Soft at first.
A low, uneven whistle.

It came from far away, rising and falling like someone breathing through a cracked pipe. Then I heard footsteps — slow, deliberate, dragging through the wet leaves.

“Hello?” I called out, instantly regretting it.

The footsteps stopped.

A moment later, something whispered my name.
Not shouted. Just whispered — right behind my ear.

The voice was my own.

I froze. Every muscle in my body screamed to look, but I remembered the paper. Don’t turn around.

So I didn’t.

I started walking again, fast, whispering anything to drown out the sound — numbers, prayers, nonsense. The fog thinned just enough for me to see something ahead: a shape. A roof.

The cabin.

⸻

The door creaked open as I approached, as if it had been waiting. Inside smelled of wet ash and something metallic. The walls were scratched in long, uneven lines, and a cold fireplace sat dark in the corner.

On the table lay a single piece of paper, pinned down by a splinter of broken glass.

⸻

New Rules
	1.	Lock the door twice.
	2.	Don’t breathe when it whistles.
	3.	Don’t speak when it uses your voice.
	4.	Don’t leave until the fire burns blue.

⸻

The door slammed behind me. The sound shook dust from the rafters.

Then came the whistle — from inside the room this time, not outside.
Low. Wet. Getting closer.

The shadows in the corner began to move.

Something unfolded itself from the darkness — tall, thin, too many joints bending as it straightened. Its skin shone dully, as if it had been rained on. When it moved, it made no sound but the faint hiss of air through that slit where its mouth should’ve been.

It tilted its head, the hollow pits where eyes should be aimed right at me.
Then, in my voice, it whispered:

“You came back.”

⸻

The next morning, hikers reported hearing whistling in the fog. They said it sounded like two voices — the same, overlapping — humming in unison.

No one ever found the person who wrote the note on the table.

But a week later, another sheet appeared nailed to a tree at the start of the trail:

⸻

Rules for Travelers Entering the Forest
	1.	If you see the cabin, don’t go inside.
That means it’s already chosen you.

The Ranger’s Log)

I’ve worked this section of forest for nearly fifteen years. I know every trail and switchback, every fallen pine, every sound these woods can make.
At least, I thought I did.

Three weeks ago, hikers reported finding a series of papers nailed to trees—rules, they said. The writing was messy but desperate. Each note warned of the same things: whistling, voices, and a cabin that shouldn’t exist.

We found the first sheet near the northern ridge. The tree it was nailed to was dead from the roots up, blackened as though it had been burned. The words read:

⸻

Rules for Travelers Entering the Forest
	1.	If you see the cabin, don’t go inside.
That means it’s already chosen you.

⸻

I collected the paper, logged the coordinates, and hiked deeper. The forest grew unnaturally quiet about a mile in. Even the wind seemed to stop at a certain point, like it was afraid to enter.

Then I saw it.

The cabin.

It wasn’t on any map—old or new. Its roof sagged under years of rot, but the chimney was still standing. Smoke curled from it in slow, heavy spirals, though no one had been there in months.

I stepped onto the porch. The boards were damp, leaving faint marks on my boots.
Inside, it smelled like rain and rust. Dust clung to everything except the table in the center of the room.

A single page lay there.
Fresh ink. Still wet.

⸻

Rules for Those Who Find the Cabin
	1.	Do not stay after sunset.
	2.	Do not speak its name.
	3.	Do not listen if the forest calls you by yours.
	4.	If you find this note, you are already too late.

⸻

The fire crackled behind me. I hadn’t lit it.

A faint whistle drifted through the room. It came from the chimney first, then from the floorboards beneath my feet. It was soft—broken, like someone trying to breathe through water.

The sound grew louder, circling me. The air thickened, pressing against my chest. Shadows stretched across the walls, moving like smoke.

Then the whistling stopped.

Right behind me, a voice whispered my name.
My own voice.

I turned.

The cabin was empty.

But in the reflection of the window, I saw something tall and pale standing behind me—skin smooth as glass, face divided by a long, black slit where a mouth should be. Its hollow eyes glowed faintly, not with light, but with depth—like openings into somewhere else.

I blinked, and the thing was gone.

I stumbled out into the clearing. The trees had shifted, growing closer together, forming a wall of dark trunks that hadn’t been there before. The fog swallowed everything.

When I reached for my radio, all I heard through the static was a low whistle.
And then—my own voice.

“You shouldn’t have turned around.”

⸻

The search team found my logbook two days later, lying at the edge of the clearing. The last entry was smudged, the ink running like it had been written in the rain.

At the bottom of the page was one more note, not in my handwriting:

⸻

Rules for the Next Searcher
	1.	If you hear the whistle, leave the forest.
	2.	If you hear your name, don’t answer.
	3.	If you find the cabin, burn this book and run.
