My name is Charlie, and I moved to a new apartment complex several months back. It’s a quiet and peaceful building for the most part, and my neighbors are all pretty nice. I had been laid off from my job, and because of that, I had to simplify my life. I didn’t go out much, At least not anywhere expensive. I would on an occasion still visit a friend, and of course there was still my new job. I got a job in a reasonably sized warehouse driving a forklift.

One day I was coming back from my shift when I saw my elderly neighbor struggling to unlock her door. She looked over at me as I was walking up.
“Oh sweetie, can you please help me get my groceries out of my car ?” Said the elderly woman.

“Sure Mrs. Margie,” I responded, ” I just need to set some things inside first.”

“Oh thank you sweetheart, I really appreciate it.” She said with a warm smile.
After I finished helping her bring up her groceries, she asked me, “so when did you get a new roommate?”

Perplexed by her question, I shot her a puzzled look and asked her, “what new roommate?”

“Early when I was getting into the elevator to leave, it looked like someone was heading into your place.” She said with a tone as if she didn’t know I’d be surprised to hear about this.

“I don’t have a new roommate Mrs. Margie. Are you sure you saw someone going into my place?” I asked her hoping she was mistaken.

She looked as if she was trying hard to remember. “Mmm, well now I’m not too sure. You know my eyes aren’t as youthful as they once were, so I’m probably just mistaken.”

“I hope so.” I said back feeling slightly better, but I wasn’t completely satisfied.

After saying that, she shot me another warm smile and said, “well you have a good rest of your day now,” before closing the door behind her. 

While still disturbed by her question, I had opened my door prepared to find my apartment ransacked. However, I was mostly prepared to find someone sill inside. I checked every room, my closet, and even under my bed, but there was no sign of life. All of my valuables were still in my apartment, and it looked like nobody had been there since I left early that morning. I eventually chalked it up to just an old women being a little nosy and making a mistake. But after that day, I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. It was as if, someone was still there with me, but I just couldn’t see them.

I felt it while I was in the restroom, the kitchen, the living room, and even my bedroom. The feeling only went away after I headed to work, the grocery store, a friend’s house, or really just anytime I left my apartment. The feeling was most intense at night. Especially, when I was laying in bed. Seeing something in the dark corner of my room became a common occurrence. These instances started becoming more frequent as the days went on. I bought a lamp for my nightstand, and a flashlight to keep in the drawer. I even purchased a .38 special just in case my fears proved justified. However, anytime I saw something in the dark corner and shined a light on it, there was nothing. Time and time again, but the result was always the same. There was just nothing to find. I began doubting my own sanity from all of this. I even told a friend about what was happening, but all she said was that maybe it was just sleep paralysis. But I didn’t see how that could be possible, since I wasn’t experiencing any form of paralysis during these encounters. Sure I felt fear, but I was never paralyzed from it.
Curious to know if I was the only one experiencing this. I asked my neighbor Paul in the elevator one day, “Have you been having the feeling like you’re being watched lately?” 

Paul was your stereotypical loner. He rarely left his apartment, and he definitely didn’t have anyone ever visit him. He barely spoke to any of his neighbors, but I doubt anyone would want to. He always had a pungent smell to him, it was like he would go days without bathing. I honestly never understood how he could hold a job, but I wasn’t even sure if he had one at the time. He was also rail thin like he barely ate, and his tall height didn’t help.

“Umm, no?” He said with a nervous chuckle,“do you feel like you’re being watched?”

“Kinda,” I said,”I’ve felt this way ever since Mrs. Margie said she thought she saw someone going into my apartment while I was out a few weeks back.”

“Sounds like you’re just paranoid Charlie, and I certainly wouldn’t trust that old woman’s eyesight,” he said while laughing,”I really doubt anyone is snooping through your apartment at night.”
After he said that, the elevator door opened up to our floor. Paul stepped out of the elevator first, and I followed suit. 

“Hope you’re right Paul. My brain has been all over the place lately.” I said while unlocking my door.

He laughed once more, “Join the club.” He said before before shutting his door.

As the weeks went on, my situation began to evolve. I started seeing a figure in all black out of the corner of my eye, but whenever I would turn to look at it, it would be gone with out a trace. 
One day after coming home from work, I found my front door unlocked. I felt a pain hit my gut. I pulled out my .38 and began to sweep my apartment. I checked every room, every corner, and under every crack and crevice, but once again, there was nothing. I felt more afraid to find nothing than I would have been to find something. I wanted my suspicions, my fears, and my paranoia to become vindicated. I wanted to finally end it and move on. After I calmed down, I went and knocked on Paul’s door.

“Yes?” He said once he opened the door.

“Hey Paul, did you see anyone messing with my door earlier today?” I asked him.

“This again?” He said,”no haven’t seen anyone messing with your door.”

I felt unsatisfied with his answer. I wouldn’t have left my own door unlocked I thought to myself. 
I think he could tell I wasn’t happy with his answer. Because he then told me,
“Why don’t you ask Margie if she saw anything.” 

I nodded, and then went down to knock on her door. I waited for a few moments before her door slowly creeped open. 
“Oh hey sweetheart, do you need something?” She said with her famous warm smile.

“Hey Mrs. Margie, I wanted to ask if you saw someone messing with my door earlier today while I was at work?”

“Oh no,” she said with her warm smile fading, “I…I…I didn’t see anybody.”

“Are you sure you didn’t see anyone?” I asked her while hopping to jog a memory.

“No, no,” she said while slowly closing the door, “like I said, I didn’t see anybody.”

After she fully closed the door, I stood there confused. She had never acted like that before. I went back inside, and plopped down on the couch. I placed my hands on my face and felt such despair. “What is happening to me.” I said over and over. I then heard a loud knock on my door. Startled, I jumped up and answered it. It was the security guard for the complex. “Hey Mike, what’s up?” I asked.

He peeked over me to look into my apartment before saying, “I hear you got a secret admirer.”

“A secret admirer?” I asked while uncomfortable by his phrasing.

“Yeah, yeah that’s right. I just got done talking to Paulie, and he told me you’ve been acting strange. He said someone has been watching you.” He said.

“Umm yeah, Mrs. Margie said she saw someone going into my place while I was out a few weeks back. I guess I’ve just been a little paranoid.” I said hoping my answer would satisfy.

“Oh I see. Well I’ll keep an extra close I on your place.” He said while reaching to shake my hand.

I reciprocated the gesture while saying, “umm, thanks Mike. I Appreciate it.”

“Yeah…. Yeah I got ya.” He said before letting go of my hand.

“You have a good one Mike.” I sad before closing the door.

“Yeah…. Yeah you too.”

Tired and drained from the day, I went and laid down in my bed. I didn’t even eat dinner. 
Later that night, I woke up to sound of my door opening. I felt fear like I had never felt before, and I was paralyzed by it. I heard soft foot steps moving about my room. I felt the blanket near my feet get lifted up, and I felt a hand wearing what felt my smooth leather begin to caress my feet. I was panicking on the inside, but I still couldn’t move. The hand glided up and across my legs. I was sick to my stomach, but I couldn’t do anything to stop what was happening. I then felt another hand begin gently rubbing my right arm. The other hand lifted from my leg, and then began softly caressing my left cheek. Whatever it was, I could tell its breathing becoming heavier. It leaned in, and I could feel its hot breath on my face. I wanted to open my eyes and look at it, but I was afraid it would kill me if I did. Besides, I think that’s just what it wanted me to do. I felt cold slimy lips touch my forehead, and then I could tell it stood up while lifting both of its hands off of me. It moved away from me, and headed towards the door. I heard my door handle turn, and then the sound of my door shutting closed. Cautiously, I peaked open my eyes. It was still in my room. It was just standing in front of my door with its back towards me, but it’s head was looking at me. It’s skin looked black and shiny with the moonlight shining on it, and it was very lanky. It kinda looked like an alien of some kind. Finally, it walked out of my room and closed my door. I just laid there until morning. Until my whole room was bathed in sunlight.

As soon as my body was free again, I got up and grabbed my .38, and once again, I swept my whole apartment from top to bottom. However, like countless times before, there was nothing.
Conceding to the idea that I am experiencing sleep paralysis, I called a psychiatrist later that day. The next few days leading up to my appointment, and for the first time in weeks, I didn’t encounter anything remotely terrifying in my apartment. Life felt almost back to the way it was. The day of my appointment came, and I talk for two hours with the psychiatrist. She confirmed to me that what I was explaining did sound like sleep paralysis. She gave me a prescription to try out and some calming methods to try if I experience another paralysis episode. After I got back to my apartment complex, I saw a moving van parked out front. I went up the elevator and saw Paul carrying out some boxes. 

“You moving out?” I said with a surprised tone.

“Yep, I got offered a lead position at another tech company a few states over,” he said, “and I already got another apartment ready.”

“Oh that’s awesome to hear, congratulations.” I said with a smile.

“Thanks man, and hey, could you help me grab the last of these boxes?” He asked.

“Sure,” I responded, “how many you got left?”

“Just those two on the ground there. I already locked up the place.” 

“Got it.” I said while picking up the boxes, and then followed him into the elevator.

He set the boxes he was holding down and turned to look at me. “So, did you ever get over your paranoia?” He asked.

“I think so Paul, I think so.”

“Well that’s good, I had a feeling you would eventually,” he said while bending over to pick back up the box, “it was just a matter of time.”

I nodded in agreement before the elevator door opened up to the lobby floor. Paul led the way to the moving van, and we placed the last boxes in the back. Paul reached out his hand, and I took it. His hands were cold, and felt vaguely familiar.

“Take care Charlie.” He said before letting go of my hand.

“You too Paul.”

After he drove off in the van, I went back up to my apartment looking to take a nap. I walked through my front door when a mysterious letter caught my eye. It was sitting on my kitchen table, and labeled: To Charlie. I walked over and opened the letter. After I was done reading the letter my stomach dropped. 

It read: Dear Charlie, I’ve really enjoyed knowing you, and being your neighbor. But these past couple months together have been the best time of my life. Especially the other night in your bedroom. P.s. your skin is really soft haha. Anyway take care. Love, Paul.
