On December 31st, 2022, the police in Greater Poland received a call from a neighbor reporting strange noises coming from a house in a small town. Three policemen were dispatched to investigate the situation, but they had no idea what they were about to encounter.

Upon arrival, the police were shocked to discover that the house belonged to a family of cannibals who had a history of butchering human flesh and making exotic dishes from human remains. Although the family had passed away, their house remained in a shabby condition, and it was on New Year's Eve that Kamilka, a 20-year-old woman, and her friends decided to play with an Ouija board, attempting to summon the spirits of the cannibalistic family and their victims.

As the group played with the Ouija board, Kamilka began acting erratically, and her friends claimed that she had become possessed. When the police arrived, they were left highly unnerved by what they saw. Kamilka's strange behavior prevented the police from going inside and saving her. As a final attempt to get her out, they placed a ladder against the side of the room where she was barricaded. However, this did not go as expected, and the situation only got worse.

The police tried to lure Kamilka out of the room by telling her that her daughter was with them, but she stayed inside. Unfortunately, not much else was caught on camera as the video ends abruptly, leaving viewers with a chilling glimpse of what happened that night.

Kamilka was eventually taken to the hospital, where she started acting normal again. However, the incident left her family and friends completely shaken, and they were unable to explain what happened inside that house. After being examined by a psychiatrist, Kamilka showed no signs of any psychiatric disorders, and her blood tests showed no traces of drugs that could explain her behavior.

The possession of Kamilka has left many questions unanswered. Was she really possessed, or did she suffer from a temporary psychosis? What caused her strange behavior? Was it the result of summoning spirits using the Ouija board, or was it the result of the history of the house she was in?

The mystery of what really happened inside that house remains unsolved to this day. However, the incident has left an indelible mark on those involved, and the video caught by the paramedic who shot it is proof of that. The Possession of Kamilka continues to haunt those who were there and those who have seen the video.

The case of Kamilka has sparked interest in the paranormal, with many people questioning the use of Ouija boards and their ability to summon spirits. Some believe that the board itself is cursed and can cause harm to those who use it, while others believe that the spirits summoned through the board can possess those who use it.

Whatever the case may be, the possession of Kamilka serves as a warning to those who dabble in the paranormal. It is a stark reminder that the line between the living and the dead is a thin one and that sometimes, it is best not to cross it.
