I sat on the couch in what I thought should be a comfortable position by any right. Many pillows stacked behind me, several overly soft blankets hugged my feet and thighs; yet my back still ached uncomfortably so. I knew it was the aftermath of the ten-plus years I served our corporate overlords, just recently being able to quite on my own accord thanks to my loving and hard-working husband. I had to keep saying that word in my head *husband, husband husband.* As I had been calling him my fiancée over eight years. Husband was such a new, exciting word I was getting used to. I loved new, exciting things. Unfortunately the excitement didn’t reach my heart after what my husband has become.

Glancing to my left I saw my husband Josh. Just two short months ago we wed in a lovely and family oriented event and although we could almost celebrate a decade of being together, I sometimes felt like we had just met. Sharing our space, hopes, dreams and love; ready for the next steps of life. Now I sat there as a woman of thirty, no human children but one very very important fur child named Flash. He was my first true love, the one that held my heart since I was just a naive girl of eighteen. We just celebrated a quiet twelfth birthday party for him which included a fun-filled day at the beach and off-leash time under the local pier. We made sure it would include all his favorite things; beach, chicken, and of course running around killing New York sized rats. When we first discovered Flash’s knack… or love for killing these invasive creatures I of course was disgusted. Not at him, I could never be disgusted at my first child but that he loved it so and I knew I needed to take him back to this same spot so he could hunt and break the necks of every large rodent. We had rules to not let him kiss our faces for months afterwards \*yes gross but that’s what we decided as a family\* and he could have his rat hunt every few months. The way his eyes would light up and how fast he truly could run even at his age… it was simply amazing and I loved that he loved every second of it.

Being that Josh was his ‘adopted father’ I never expected him to dedicated the same love and time I did on my fur-child but from the moment he met him I knew he had a soul that could love a dog as much if not more than a human. It wasn’t a make it or break it sort of thing but after a string of failed situationships I had before Josh I did let him know within several hours of seeing his unkempt face that I needed to be honest with him about the no-human children thing. I am here for Flash, animals and for art, love of life and living; we have too many humans on this earth it does not need one more from me.

Josh always said the right things for the most part. He said I am the one and that although he hoped ill change my mind, he’ll never pressure me because he wants me for me and everything else is extra. It was beautiful and moving. After several weeks of dating we were in the shower together and I said I loved him, he said so back although it was always a cute disagreement over who had said so first.

I told him my ultimate dream of owning a house with a large enough yard to have big animals like horses or even if we’re lucky enough- an American bison. I absolutely love those majestic animals and all my close friends and family knew that it was a strange albeit understandable goal of such a non-normal 90’s kid. I never wanted fame, fortune, or human kids. I aimed for just enough to live in my own home, surrounded by the things I loved. So even before Josh I was working full time, living in my own apartment and taking a full load of college courses. Josh was a community college drop-out being paid under the table for part-time work with a man whom owned an HVAC company. I didn’t mind though as I would always be the bread-winner; or thought that would be the case. I never considered I could be a stay at home woman. Really I was happy as long as he worked somewhere that gave him a W2 so that we could qualify for a place together. It all seemed to be falling into place when I began to fix his credit, resume and debt. I bought him his first ever new vehicle with the fancy backup camera and Rino-lined truck bed. He did put in genuine effort at first; my very insistent nagging played a huge roll on him applying to better jobs; which he later would joke with friends and family that the only reason he landed the job he has now is because of my ‘rather harsh but necessary pushing.’

After he moved up the ladder in his company that was far smaller but cared far more for their employees than mine, I was able to handle everything else. All finances we combined within months of us meeting. Everyone that knew us questioned our quick decisions but honestly to us it felt natural. We would joke that everyone else doesn’t have the trust and love that we felt for each-other almost immediately. But we were soul-mates after all. Twin flames, partners from a past life. All those things we convinced ourselves of because our lives were heading in such a monumentally amazing direction.

It was after a car accident that I noticed something very wrong. His behavior which had always been gentle yet excited for each day turned… darker. That was three years ago. We had gotten engaged in the most lovely way. We bought our first home, everything was going so amazingly until some young kid smacked hard into the back of Josh’s truck. Thankfully the truck was of such a build that he was still able to drive it to work right after, leaving the kid with parents having arrived on scene and exchanging necessary information. We didn’t think much of it. The truck was repaired shortly after but I noticed Josh wincing and moving slightly different. I recommended he see a doctor but he waived it off as just slight pain from minor whip-lash. I trusted his judgement as we had been together so long at that point and he had proven to be a type of man that I never thought possible; hard-working, intelligent, funny, sexy and loving. And prior to this accident our sex life was astonishingly amazing. The first time I tried to initiate after this accident was perhaps a month in; I did the gentle nuzzle; wrapping one leg over his. He gently pulled away, saying his back and neck and he couldn’t. I completely understood and massaged his head until I heard gentle snores, not thinking much of it other than sympathy for my man’s pain. A few months passed and I tried subtle gestures and hints showing my interest but wanting him to lead the way in his own healing; never wanting to push my boundaries. Nothing happened and I grew more confused and hurt.

One day after he came home from work complaining over a long and grueling day he shuffled off towards our bedroom where he would drop his work bag, put on comfier clothes and probably go to the bathroom before joining me out in the living room to watch our shows. I had pulled up and paused our most recent show before realizing my phone was close to dying and I my main charger was in the car so I went to the bedroom to grab my backup. When I turned the corner my heart froze. Hunched over on the edge of the bed was my fiancée, his back to me looking unusually crumpled as of something of supreme weight was on top of it. His head hung at an unnatural angle and I let out a quiet “Josh?” he immediately he straightened and did something quick with his hands which I could not see. “what are you doing?” I continued. He stood up, turned and went to the bathroom without saying a word. I went over to the door and knocked softly. “Is everything ok?” I said still shaken over what looked so very wrong.

“Im fine, ill be out in a sec.” he said. It seemed like he was trying to sound like his light-hearted self but something was off even in his voice. I turned and went back to where he had been sitting. Unfortunately but understandably straight men tend to be a bit of a mess, even as I looked over all the discarded shirts and loose change I shook my head. I even had his own laundry basket over there so he could put the clothes that he had worn but weren’t ‘dirty, dirty’ in his opinion. I thought it silly but I gladly worked around his silly if only slightly annoying quirks. That’s when a strange odor hit me. It smelled sickly sweet. Like fruit that had gone bad. I glanced around, taking some of his shirts and inhaling a large whiff only to realize they smelled alright. It was something lingering in the air. I convinced myself I was just looking for something that wasn’t there; some sign of something deeper. Yes our sex life had fallen off the face of the earth but there was a perfectly fine explanation for that. Something moved under the bed. My breath caught and I jumped back, hands out ready to defend myself. Everything was still. I slowly lowered myself to the hardwood, looking under the bed. The smell was stronger but I couldn’t see anything as it was completely black. I wanted to reach my hand under but something in the back of my brain was telling me no, no, no. I thought something crinkled like a hard plastic wrapper.

I heard Josh flush the toilet and jumped up, running as softly as I could to the living room, landing into my nest of pillows and blankets, trying to look normal. He came out over five minutes later. Why so much longer after he flushed the toilet? “Hey darlin how was your day?” I replied “Fine, fine. Um you ok?”

“Well back is sore of course. Actually really really sore you think you could?”

“Oh that sucks, I can rub it for you honey.”

He replied with slightly more vigor “yah that would be great!”

He positioned himself as he had done hundreds of times before. For the last eight months since the accident I usually offered to rub his back since he would probably ask anyway. Then after a few shows he would say he’s tired and give me a kiss before leaving me on the couch and climbing into bed without me. I tried to not think too much of it at first. He was just tired and hurting. He worked so much now and I had been working from home so I felt guilty with even having thoughts of why he didn’t try to be romantic or even a little passionate. But it had been so long. I made a decision I would ask him about it the next day; in a nice way. What could I do to help our intimacy, maybe bring up going to the doctor again or a couples therapist? I went to bed in the dark, seeing the silhouette of his body, back facing towards me. He wasn’t snoring, he seemed so still. so unlike him, he was wiggler in bed and a snorer. I lied down next to him reaching a hand toward his shoulder but something stopped me. It was like all the air in the room left. A crinkling sound, I looked around but it was near pitch black with only the outlines of furniture. Snickering….  I don’t remember falling asleep….

The next day when he came home he did his same routine and I stayed out in the living room eagerly awaiting him. I could tell that the time he spent in our room was getting longer. There would be no reason for it as it was the same routine.

He came out and I smiled, patting his usual spot next to me on the couch. “How was your day sweetness?” I said knowing I was about to say something not so sweet.

“Oh the usual. Been in so much pain but have to keep goin at it right?” he laughed.

“You do so much for this little family and you know I’m so grateful of you.”

He nodded, having heard this many times. He was always humble “All for you darlin.”

I almost didn’t say what I wanted to say. Almost. But I knew I needed to.

“So um.. what was that yesterday? With you sitting on the bed and the weird smell?”

“What are you talking about?” he said. Not with anger; he seemed genuinely confused.

“When you were sitting on the edge of the bed all hunched over and when I said your name you went into the bathroom and never responded to me; there also was a weird smell.”

He laughed then “Sorry babe sometimes a man needs to use the bathroom and we don’t always smell the greatest right before that.”

I shook my head. “No no it wasn’t that type of smell. It was different.. fruity. But not.”

“well I mean fruity is better than what it usually smells like so win for me” he gave a half-smile. The one he knows I think is cute and dorky.

“ok fine but there’s another thing I want to talk about. Why haven’t you been able to have sex or even try to the last couple months.”

That took him off guard. He huffed and looked around as if there was an audience but it was only the two of us. “I’m serious Josh what is that about, you wont see a doctor. You claim you’re in pain but you still go to work everyday so is it me? Am I not doing something that will help you heal?”

Something flitted across his eyes then. “But babe… I’ve been fine.” He said simply.

“What, no you haven’t? you always say you’re back is hurting and I’ve tried to be gentle but we haven’t had sex in months and I figured it’s because of that.”

He laughed. It wasn’t a genuine laugh. More of a grunt. “Ive been fine for months, just wanted the back rubs after work is all.”

“so wait… you haven’t wanted to be intimate with me even though your back is ok?”

He tilted his head as if this was old news. My heart felt like it was being pierced. This was not the Josh I knew or loved. Who was this? He seemed distracted, pulled-away. I was hurt and confused and I said as much.

“Listen its not a big deal just let it happen when it happens.”

I got upset. I went into our bedroom and slammed the door. It had been months MONTHS and he was treating this like it was nothing. I remember writing down my thoughts and I kept looking at my email because every time I had gotten this upset before he would either e-mail me a sweet note or would give me a hand-written one the next day. I fell asleep at some point. When I woke up Josh was gone. I quickly looked at my email, nothing from him. I looked all around my bedside table. I looked all over the living room, kitchen. I went over ever space again thinking I had missed it. This was our thing when we got into an argument. He knew that I appreciated that he wrote his feelings down and he would always end with something very sweet and loving. Now. Nothing.

The couch smelled of rotting fruit.

That afternoon he came back from work. I was busying myself in the garage. He glanced in, nodded and went to the bedroom. I couldn’t believe this. We hadn’t texted all day and he just came in and nodded at me like we were what, roommates?

I heard the bedroom door close. That’s a new one. Usually, he wouldn’t bother to close it, we live alone save Flash who really doesn’t care if clothes are on or not. I stood in the kitchen looking down the hallway toward our bedroom. Something was off and I couldn’t shake the feeling. I waited a few more minutes but decided enough is enough. I’m going to ask why he’s been acting like this. Why every day he seems to drift away from me and not even realize it or care. I threw open the door. It was the most horrific thing I had ever seen.

A black female-shaped mass was face down on his crotch. Her head gyrated back and forth. Josh’s head was stooped. Eyes half-closed, mouth open in a silent moan. I could only tell it was female from its shape; otherwise completely featureless. Josh’s pants lay on the ground around his ankles. Inky arms flanked his legs and clawed fingers grasped his thighs. My scream caught in my throat and the thing jerked its head up causing Josh to shudder.

“Josh!” I screeched. He was unresponsive save for a drop of drool that left his lips. The thing, although I couldn’t see its eyes, was looking at me. I felt a fear grip me like I’d never felt before nor ever thought imaginable. I couldn’t move, my heart felt like it would break out of my chest. I could feel it’s amusement. I heard Flash bark from somewhere in the house. The thing stood up and did something truly horrific.

It reached up and grabbed Josh’s right ear. Holding it in both hands almost tenderly. She bent down and seemed to be whispering in his ear for only a moment before starting to crawl into his ear. Yes she contorted her body, making those crinkling noises I had heard before. Twisting and jerking. Parts of her started to disappear into Josh’s ear. His head would jerk but otherwise he seemed completely listless. The worst part was that the entire time she was looking at me. Her featureless face never moved as her whole body contorted and forced its way into Josh. The last thing I saw was the top part of her face that stayed for just a moment longer. Staring at me, unmoving. The crackling stopped but I could feel her thoughts. And I translated it to mean that he was hers now.
