Well, I think I should rather say, where he was. And that’s the thing that really creeps me out.

But to tell you that story, I have to give you some background information.

Growing up, my life wasn’t what one would call rosy. I’m an only child and not even a wanted one at that.

At least, if you could ask my mother, she might tell you.

Then again, she probably would lie. You know, to keep up appearances.

Those times when she told me how she really felt about my existence were only ever in private, and more often than not after something bad had happened.

Either when she was holding an ice pack to her face, cooling the new black eye, or after she had fallen down the stairs drunk.

She wasn’t a good woman and even less of a mother.

My dad, on the other hand, was something almost worse.

He wasn’t the abusive one, at least not to me, or well, at least not in the beginning.

I still have memories of us visiting the park and playground.

Him, pushing me on the swing, while I laughed.

That was the main difference between my parents. My mother would have done something like that as well, but only so other people could see how normal our family was.

Dad didn’t give a shit about that. He never cared about what anyone else said or thought. All that mattered to him was himself.

What brought him fun. What cured his boredom.

He liked to drink, yes, but he wasn’t a mean drunk.

I never once remember him hitting me or even screaming at me when he stumbled home from the bar or beating my mom when the beer ran dry.

That wasn’t his style.

The cruelty he displayed was done stone-cold sober, and in a way, that makes it so much worse.

My parents fought almost all the time. Between my mom calling my dad useless and a piece of shit, spitting on him, and him tripping her, shoving her face-first into walls, or making her cry, my upbringing really felt like hell.

As I said before, Mom was the more obvious abusive one, at least to me.

And the older I got, the more I became her personal lightning rod.

If Dad hit her, she hit me. He punched her for ‘mouthing off’, she’d make sure I would feel her pain. He made fun of her life, she’d do her best to make me cry.

Well... at least I wasn’t popular at school, so I didn’t have people who could witness that stuff.

The only one who saw and knew what was going on was Dad, and more often than not, he thought it was funny.

I do remember him chuckling when Mom managed to make me cry and almost howling with laughter when she pushed me so I fell and hit my head on the edge of the table, pulling down a bowl of cereal in the process.

Yeah, that was my Dad.

Always looking for things that made it interesting.

Well, he did start actively participating in the crueler stuff once I hit puberty.

He started getting this strange look on his face from time to time.

This... grin felt so cold and cruel, I still shiver when I think about it.

Once I saw it, I knew that something was about to happen.

Sometimes he would hit me when I walked past and delight at my pained groans or shrieks.

And I always reacted, because, you know, not giving him the satisfaction only led to a second, harder punch.

But he at least kept aiming away from my face and only hit my body, where almost no one would see the bruises.

Of course, I tried talking to teachers about it, but only once.

It happened when I was about fourteen or fifteen.

My coach saw a giant black bruise on my ribs and asked me about it, and I foolishly told him the truth.

That was when I think everything began to change.

Police were called, as was CPS.

They turned up at our home, and Dad played innocent, while Mom supported him.

Of course, she did.

You know... What would the neighbors think?

That night, Dad woke me up with his big hand pressed on my mouth and nose, while he asked me if I would prefer it like that.

I struggled and tried to push his hand away, but he kept me in place with what seemed like the greatest ease. He began insulting me, threatening me, making fun of me. The only thing I remember vividly is how my arms and legs started to shake, and I felt myself passing out in the darkness.

When I came to again, Dad was gone and the house was silent once more, but from then on, he got far more vicious.

To me and Mom.

Sometimes I was startled awake by my mother suddenly screaming in pain. Other times, I found her sitting on the floor, crying.

I know how fucked up that sounds, but I hugged her and told her that we could just leave because even after all that messed up stuff, she still was my mother and I was scared for her.

Well... I think back then, sitting on the floor of the kitchen next to her, she had her first and only genuine conversation with me.

She told me that we couldn’t. That Dad would find us, as he always did.

Twice before, she had tried, when I had been just a baby, but he always knew where we were, she warned me.

I think about that conversation from time to time.

Especially now.

It’s giving me the creeps.

Half a year later, she was dead.

I think I was fifteen by then when I came home from school and immediately felt that something was off. There was this noise coming from inside the house, reaching me, as I stood in the doorway, and I felt my legs going weak.

The sound of Dad, hitting someone.

Something I had heard so many times before, yet in that moment, I immediately realized that it sounded different... wrong.

I really wanted to turn around and run, to leave on my own, but my body didn’t listen to me. Slowly, I walked into the house, toward the source of those dreadful sounds, and I think you can already imagine what I saw.

Dad was standing over my Mom’s lifeless body, with that strange grin on his face, still hitting her over and over again.

That sight has been seared into my mind.

I’ve spent years in therapy, yet can’t shake it, can’t stop myself from waking up, screaming, almost every night.

Back then, I was sure I would be next. That in a matter of seconds, he would be upon me, beating me to death as well.

But that didn’t happen.

He just turned around to look at me, then smiled and told me to call the cops...

‘This is gonna be interesting,’ he said.

It took me what felt like an eternity to call the police, while he still kept on hitting that lifeless, broken, and bloody corpse on the floor.

The cops showed up and took him away, yet all the while, he still had this creepy smile on his face.

I would love to say that my life got better from then on, but... you know.

The prosecution wanted me as a witness, but in the end, they decided they didn’t need to put me through the trauma again, as Dad was completely cooperative on his own. He was sentenced to life in prison and I was put into the system.

It wasn’t overly cruel, but since I was almost of age, no one bothered to do much with me anyway.

I stopped getting beaten, at least, but the mean comments and cruel jokes were replaced by almost complete isolation.

As I said before, no one wanted anything to do with me.

So, even if I knew that I should have been happy, my life didn’t really get better until I finally turned eighteen and could set off on my own.

I struggled and fought to carve out my own life and after years of setbacks, I think I finally managed to get at least a semblance of what one might call normalcy.

Working hard, in my case, actually helped.

I own a small, run-down house in a bad but affordable neighborhood.

I have a steady job and have managed to get promoted a few times already.

The only thing I’m missing in my life is company. Well, I think you can guess why I have trouble with that.

Especially now.

You see... Dad has written me letters.

It started pretty soon after he was incarcerated.

I know, I shouldn’t even have opened them, but back then, I felt like that was the only connection I still had with anyone.

I only wrote back once, but he didn’t even mention anything about what was in my letter.

As always, everything was about himself.

He told me what had happened after the trial, how he didn’t care a damn thing about what anyone thought... you know, stuff I expected.

I got long, almost rambling letters about prison life and the people he met in there.

Who he liked and who he hated. How one of the wardens mistreated him, then a month later, how that man had died in an unfortunate accident.

Sometimes I read those messages out of boredom, other times I threw them out, but at least once a month, I got a letter in the mail, addressed to me.

I thought it would stop after I left the orphanage, but no.

No matter where I stayed, it always found me.

He always found me.

Just as my mother said.

I got a letter when I moved into a small, shabby apartment, even one when I was homeless for a few weeks and slept at work.

Of course, I tried to ask the prison he was in, if they were responsible for that, but they denied any involvement outright.

I even got one as soon as I bought this small rundown house. It greeted me when I stepped onto the curb as a homeowner for the first time.

The first letter in my mailbox, and it was from the man that fucked up my life.

I read through it and the content was almost as I expected.

Someone had come at my Dad with a knife and had soon found themselves in an accident. Prison food was boring, as was the routine. It wasn’t interesting anymore.

I could feel sweat breaking out all over my body, as I read those lines.

Old memories flooded my mind.

He hated being bored, that was always the time when things got worse.

Another letter followed, two weeks later.

All it contained were five words.

‘Seeing you might be interesting.’

I called the police as soon as I had read it, and they assured me that everything would be fine.

Damn liars.

I know something is off.

Someone called me yesterday, asking me if I had heard anything.

There are police cars driving up and down the street in front of my house, every half hour.

I think he has broken out of prison.

I can feel it in my bones.

Something is coming.

Huh...

Thinking back now, that last letter was different.

No postmark.

Shit.
