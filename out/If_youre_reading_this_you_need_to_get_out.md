I'm so sorry. I didn't think it was a big deal. Now, You MUST help others out, or else they're dead too. Look, I'll tell you what happened right from the start.

It all started 3 months ago, where me and my friend Andrew were at the bus stop to head to school. We aren't siblings, just good friends. My memory of that specific day is a little fuzzy, but I remember it well enough. Andrew asked me if I knew what his father was doing, and I said no. I didn't have a clue what Andrew's dad was doing. Andrew, for that matter, didn't know either, which is why he asked me. Let's skip boring details, shall we? Me and Andrew were in second period when his father checked him out of school. 

Of course, I found this odd, but I didn't question it. After school, I texted him to see why his father checked him out. He didn't respond. I shrugged it off, thinking he was busy. But God, I wish I hadn't. It had been a whole week since he had texted me, and I was beginning to get worried. He texted me on Wednesday of the next week, telling me that his dad took him on vacation. He also asked me if I wanted to hang out after school, and I said yes of course. When we hung out after school, he seemed.. different? Not in a good way. Like he was a puppet tied on strings, careful with his words. He looked different too, almost like his skin was melting off. 

I feel bad about admitting this, but I lied and told him he had to go back home, so that way I could get some sleep that night without being plagued with nightmares. My parents just told me that he was just acting differently because of the vacation, and that he will be back to normal soon. I really hoped so, but of course, the world had to throw a curveball at me. One by one, people in my school were disappearing for a week and coming back differently. Even teachers. Andrew came back to school, and his personality was completely different than I remembered. Normally he loved to act weird with me, and didn't care if he was humiliating his friends because of it. But now? He distances himself from me, only hanging out after school. And I wouldn't have found this weird, but along with the sudden and direct personality change and physical appearance change, It unnerved me.

We had a fight about a week later, I told him that he was completely isolating himself from me and my friends, and he told me I needed to stop being so clingy. It hurt indeed, but I assumed he was right. 

2 months had passed, and almost everyone in my school had been taken for a week and returned. Even my parents said that their co-workers had been taken for a week. I hated it. The next day, I got called to the office to get checked out. I was scared, what was going to happen to me? Was I going to die? Would I be killed? Or would I go missing for a week and return, different? I nearly cried in relief when I saw it was my mom, but that relief quickly disappeared when she told me what was going on. 'I don't know what's happening, but something's wrong. I've already picked up your brother, we need to get home fast.' Those words sent a horrible feeling down my spine. 

Shortly after we got home, My parents instructed me and my little brother to get inside my room, Lock the door, and not answer anybody. Even them. An hour passed, and my parents started screaming 'get out!' at someone. Another hour passed. They went silent. 30 minutes later, there was banging on my door, instructing for anyone in the room to get out or else the door would be broken down. 

I did the only thing I thought was right. I told my little brother to hide. If anyone was going to be taken, It was not going to be my little brother. 5 minutes ticked by, and someone broke down my door. To my ultimate surprise, It was Andrew's father. He seemed to find me and my brother instantaneously, ripping us out of our hiding spots. 

I was knocked out by something, The last thing I heard was my parents crying out, 'stay away from her!' and then I blacked out.

I woke up in a completely white room, with only a bed and a table with some bloodied surgical tools. Oh God, the SMELL of that place nearly made me throw up. No one entered my room for 3 days, if you don't count someone that brought in stale bread and water for you to eat and drink. I heard faint screams from other rooms, screams of agony and despair. I was scared. Scratch that, I was horrified. 10 days flew by, and I was beginning to lose my energy. I mean, who wouldn't lose their energy if they were given nothing to eat except stale bread and water? 15 days. 20 days, 25 days. It had almost been a whole month, and I didn't have any energy left.

On the 27th day there, someone came in the room for the first time. It was Andrew, and a couple of his friends. What horrified me the most about Andrew, was his completely black eyes, with blood red pupils. I naturally backed away from him, and I swear I could see hurt momentarily cross through his face. But it was gone in a flash, and he simply said, 'you know, you should be happy! You should be grateful that I didn't give you one of the rooms that one of the... patients... had been in.' 

At that point I was absolutely certain I was going to die. His friends picked me up, and slammed me down on the bed, stunning me. Everything went fuzzy, and I could feel something strapping down my arms and legs. I was horrified, struggling immensely. My horror grew times 50 when I saw what Andrew had; a surgical knife. 'It only hurts in the beginning, I promise' he said. I knew I was going to die, I was going to become like everybody else in this goddamned place. 

I kept struggling though, Andrew was getting angry with me, telling me to hold still so he could make a clean cut. As you would naturally guess, It only made me struggle more. This part's really fuzzy for me, but I'll try to explain it the best I can. I felt this rush of... Adrenaline, and I ripped out of the chains, falling off of the surgical bed(?) I don't know how, but I managed to slam his head against the wall. He was knocked out for now. I ran out of the room, as the door had been left wide open. Guess Andrew thought I wouldn't try to escape. This part I remember very clearly. As I was trying to find the exit, I saw this... Machine. It was- It was, being fed. With corpses. Blood was everywhere around the place, including guts, assorted organs, and chunks and bits of brains and other things that I probably shouldn't say. 

I ran past the cells, praying that I would find an exit. I found it. In the cell next to me, My little brother was there. And in another cell were my parents, being sliced open. I heard their screams. Their begs of mercy. If I still wasn't filled with adrenaline, I would have been frozen in horror. I did the only thing that I thought was right. I ripped open my little brother's cell door, and I grabbed his hand. I assumed he was next. I don't know if my little brother was sobbing in fear or in relief. I broke through the door, running across open grass. This doesn't look anywhere near my neighborhood. In fact, It looks like I'm a whole state away. But I didn't have time to linger on it for long, as I heard an alarm sound. I bolted forward, dragging my little brother with me. He begged me to slow down, but I knew I couldn't. I don't know how I managed to outrun those... Things. Pieces of machinery. I don't dare to call them people. 

I ran. And I ran some more. And finally, I reached a cliffside. I tried to run past them, but they shoved me down and grabbed My little brother. One of them aimed for me, but I took a step back. I should never have taken a step back. I fell down, into water. A lake of some sort. I remember falling into the water and blacking out.

Please, if you're reading this, HELP. Or more importantly, stay away from people who went missing for a week and came back different. PLEASE. PLEASE PROMISE ME. I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYONE ELSE GET CHOPPED INTO BITS!

Oh God, My phone's dying.
