I don’t know exactly what it is, but I am certain I am not alone. I don’t know how it got in; I locked all my doors, and my windows are shut. I ALWAYS check that before going to bed. So, logically, I should be the only one here. But I’m not. I'm certain I’m not.

And it’s not my dog. He’s right beside me, asleep. Like I was just a few minutes ago. But something woke me up. It wasn’t a sound but a feeling. Am I still asleep? Is this sleep paralysis? No… I can move. I sat up in my bed. I am wide awake and alert. But I don’t know what has alerted me.

All I know is that it’s not nothing. There is something in here. Some "thing". But I can’t see it. The light switch is right there. I could flip it easily. But I’m frozen. My entire attention is consumed by what is in front of me. But all I see in front of me is darkness. Emptiness. A void. I’m not usually scared of the dark. Well, not more than anyone else, I’d say. So is it the dark that I am afraid of now? No, there’s something IN the dark. Waiting.

Do I see eyes? Eyes staring back at me? Do I see teeth patiently waiting for me to close my eyes again, to strike when I’m most vulnerable? Do I hear the breath of something sinister? Does it smell wrong in here? I am scanning all my senses for any kind of evidence to justify this feeling. And I’m coming back with nothing. So I should feel safe. But I don’t.

I want to call out to it. But what then? I have no weapon on me. I know I should have kept a knife or a gun or a bat or a flashlight or… anything. For nights like this. And maybe there have been nights like this where nothing has happened and there was nothing in the dark except my own creations. But this time feels different. I don’t THINK there’s something there. I KNOW there’s something there.

I’m trying to explain it to myself, but I keep coming up short. I know I’m not making sense. Half of me thinks I’m wrong, but the other half knows I’m right. And knowing is stronger than thinking. But what IS it? It’s nothing. It’s got to be nothing. The doors are locked, the windows are sealed, my dog hasn’t been alerted, and I’m just fucking crazy.

Except my dog just woke up. He turned his head to where I’ve been looking for the past hour. And he’s locked to it. His ears are up, and they are pointed away from me. He is still. I knew I wasn’t crazy; he SEES something. Something that I can’t see. But he’s not moving either. I wish he’d just bark or chase it so that whatever is in this room with us would scurry out and this would be over and I could go back to sleep. But now I know that something IS out there. I already knew it too. And he knows it now too. And whatever it is, it’s something that has him frozen, too. Is he scared like me? What could scare him like this? What could scare me like this?

Fuck, what do I do? If I reach for my phone, it could get to me before I even dial the first number. If I reach for the light, it could tear me to shreds with its teeth. If I make a move, it will certainly get to me, and I will be dead. But I have to do something. Fuck, I have to do SOMETHING.

I steel my resolve. I’m going to do it. I’m going to turn on the lights. Fuck this game of cat and mouse. And fuck whatever is in the room with me. I can’t take not knowing anymore. I can’t take waiting. Nothing is worse than waiting. Anything is better than not moving. Going for the light is better than not breathing. The sounds I make leaning over to the switch are better than this sickening silence. The creak of the mattress is like an explosion, but it is better than the empty space between me and whatever my fate shall be. Waiting didn’t help me, and thinking about it only made it worse, so what else is there besides action?

I start the chain reaction. My fingers are the first to come to life (they hurt as they creak to life). I move my arm (it is the heaviest it has ever been). I breathe in (how long has it been since my last breath?). My back stretches at an awkward angle towards the light switch (it is so much further away than I remember it being). Sweat beads on my forehead (I can taste the air). My dog’s ears twitch to the sound of my body gliding against the sheets (his gaze is still locked forward). I can hear my own heart (every beat takes forever). My fingertips touch cold plastic (I have arrived). My entire body hesitates (I pull the switch).

I knew it.

I fucking knew it.

There’s something in here with me.
