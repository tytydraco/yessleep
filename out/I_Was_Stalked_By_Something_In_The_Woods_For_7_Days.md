**Day 3.**  

The beans ran out at first light. Three days. Three days of pissing yourself dry, of chewing bark to trick your stomach. The last can was dented, rust bleeding at the seams. I’d lost the canteen somewhere—probably when I fell, though the bruises all blurred together now.  

Three days. Three days of footsteps pacing mine, always three seconds behind. Three days of waking to wet, clicking breaths outside the tent. Three days of no sleep. Just the knife in my hand.  

The trail dissolved into thorns. I crawled to a seep spring, lapped water from a skunk cabbage leaf like a dog. The taste was mud and rot.  

That’s when I saw the tree.  

Splinters jutted from the Douglas fir like broken ribs. 

Three gashes split the trunk, nine inches between each. Sap oozed black, thick as clotting blood. Too deep for a bear. Too precise.  

I didn’t run.

Running wasted calories.  

The campsite stank of wet stone and my own sour skin. I stabbed the tent stakes into the creek bend, hands shaking. The fire spat embers that died in the dirt. Cold beans trembled in the can. I scooped them with my fingers, metal scraping enamel. When I licked the lid, my tongue caught a rusted edge.  

Empty.  

No food. 

No water. 

Just the thing that had followed me since night one, when I’d heard my name—*James*—rasped in a voice that cracked like dry sticks.  

Darkness came.  

The growl started low. 

Not animal. 

Not machine. 

A wet, grating shudder, like something dragging a blade over bone. My flashlight flickered. Shadows pooled between the birches.  

Nothing.  

Then the trees *twitched*.  

Not the wind. Branches jerked, torn by something moving too fast to see. The beam caught a flash of black—not fur, not skin. A hole. A void. The light bent around it.  

I didn’t sleep.  

I lay rigid, the tent floor gouging my spine. My heartbeat thumped in my throat. The woods held its breath. No crickets. No wind. Even the creek’s babble died, choked mid-flow.  

Something scraped the tent wall.  

A slow, deliberate drag. Claws? Antlers? The nylon shuddered. I stopped breathing.  

The silence split.  

A wet crunch, close. *Too close.* Like teeth sinking into gristle. The smell hit me—coppery, sweet. Meat left in the sun.  

I didn’t move until dawn.  

When I unzipped the tent, the fire pit was smeared with a black paste. Flies writhed in it. Half-buried in the ashes lay a deer’s skull, stripped pink. The spine dangled from a branch, vertebrae knotted with sinew.  

The claw marks on the fir tree now numbered six.  

Fresh sap dripped, hot and sticky, into my hair as I passed.

**Day 4.**  

I was lost.  

I navigated by the sun’s haze, sweat welding my shirt to my skin until the fabric chafed raw.  

Its stench arrived—wet iron and spoiled marrow.  

It wasn’t stalking. It was *herding*. Driving me eastward.  

Twice, movement flickered at the edge of my vision—limbs too long, joints too many, retreating into shadow.  

The woods thickened into black spruce, their branches tangled tightly.  

I found wolf scat studded with hare teeth, and a raven’s skull cradled in fiddleheads. The air buzzed with flies.  

Night fell.  

I built no fire.  

It would smell the smoke. 

I wedged myself under a widowmaker cedar, its trunk crawling with bark beetles that dropped onto my neck. The knife handle fused to my palm.  

Silence. Then—  

Footsteps.  

Not the rhythm of predator or prey. A drag-and-crunch, drag-and-crunch—the sound of something that walked despite its bones’ protest.  

Sap rained from the cedar, pooling in the hollow of my collarbone. Breathing followed—a wet suck-and-wheeze.  

It passed so close I tasted its breath—peat smoke and spoiled meat. Moonlight traced its silhouette, seven feet of angles, shoulders hunched, limbs strung with joints.  

Its skin was not skin. Lichen scaled its flanks, the flesh beneath shimmering black. Where its thigh brushed a thimbleberry bush, its hide peeled away in strips, revealing muscle—fibrous, gray, threaded with yellow veins.  

It stopped. Cocked its head. A drop of saliva fell from its maw, burning through an oxalis leaf with a hiss.  

**Day 5.**  

I moved as if wounded, crouched and lurching between nurse logs slick with slug trails and granite outcroppings strung with lichen. My boots sank into moss seeping rusty water.  

I was starving.  

I peeled strips of cedar bark, nails splitting as I chewed the fibers into a paste.  

When I found salmonberries, their skins burst, releasing juice that burned my throat.  

I gagged at the grit, tongue rasping over quartz for calories that didn’t exist.  

I made a throwing stick, a wrist-thick alder branch, one end blackened over coals.  

Then a spear, stripped spruce carved to a point and tempered in ash.  

By dusk, my palms oozed serum, the blisters burst and gloving my hands in shredded skin.  

I climbed a lodgepole pine, belt cinched to the trunk, boots wedged in fissures crawling with carpenter ants. They bit my calves. 

The tree shuddered.  

Not from wind.  

From the growl that vibrated up its roots—a tearing sound.  

Below, lit by a pale moon, the creature left its catechism.  

A snowshoe hare, opened with precision.  

Entrails coiled in a spiral.  

The heart balanced on a cairn of its teeth—incisors stacked, molars arranged in a strange pattern.  

In the soil beneath, letters carved deep.  

*YOU.*  

The thing wasn’t hunting anymore.  

It was *curating*.  

**Day 6**  

I drank from a seep spring, water strained through my shirt. The cloth teemed with larvae. I ate them. Felt their bodies burst between my teeth, brine on my tongue.  

I began to hallucinate.  

Shadows pulsed with light. Birch trunks twisted into shapes—my father in his ranger uniform, hissing *Track the blood*. A girlfriend’s laugh tangled in the bracken, decaying into a jay’s shriek.  

A raven hung from a Douglas fir, wings pinned by sinews, beak open, cradling maggots. Claw marks spiraled the trees, grooves leaking sap.  

I threw the spear at nothing—at air. It struck cedar, the shaft snapping with a crack. When I pulled it free, the wood blistered my hands, coated in mucus that smoked and burned the lichen away.  

Night fell. I crouched in nettles, barbs digging into my forearms, each sting sharp. Flint sparked, but the char cloth was damp. The creature’s breath fogged the dark, three rasps, close now. *Behind. Left. Above.*  

I dreamt awake, its face a patchwork of bark and flesh, eyes veined with ink. Its tongue slid into my ear, whispering in the language of wasps and ice.  

**Day 7**  

My body began to shut down.  

I crawled through a gully, devil’s club thorns piercing my sleeves.  

The air stank of skunk cabbage and decay.  

I came upon a clearing.  

Sunlight cut through the canopy, gilding a midden of bones.  

Femurs thrust upward, marrow sucked clean, grooves spiraling from unseen teeth.  

Skulls clung to hemlock roots, sockets blooming with fungi, their gills glowing in the dusk.  

A human pelvis hung from a vine, the sacrum splintered open, a Zippo lighter—green with corrosion—jammed where the spine had been.  

The freshest corpse undid me.  

A femur still sheathed in denim, fabric fused to decaying flesh.  

Nearby, a boot with its sole split open, toes stripped to knuckles of gristle.  

Night fell.  

I dug a pit with raw hands, fingers churning through loam until my palms glistened with blood and lymph.  

I covered the hole with spruce boughs, their needles quivering, then marked the earth with my own urine to mask the scent of soil.  

Survival manuals teach traps as formulas—depth, angle, trigger.  

They leave out the sacrament.  

The beetles crawling into my sleeves, mandibles needling my wrists.  

The way the pit gaped, waiting.  

A few hours passed.  

And then, the creature came.  

Not as predator, but as reckoning.  

It *detonated* from the treeline, limbs churning in grotesque synchrony, joints firing erratically.  

I thrust my spear upward, aiming for the hollow beneath its ribs. The point skidded off its carapace, a lattice of moss-coated plates oozing black ichor. The impact rattled through my arms, bones vibrating painfully.  

I drew my knife and swung. A backhanded slash caught its thigh, the blade slicing through tissue that tore. Yellow pus erupted in a spray, splattering my face.  

It *burned*. I screamed, clawing at my eyes as vision dissolved into white.  

Then its talons found me.  

A backhanded blow sent me tumbling backward.  

Ribs snapped.  

It lunged—jaws unraveling into a maw lined with jagged teeth.  

The ground gave way.  

The pit swallowed it whole.  

For a moment, there was silence.  

Then the alder stakes screamed—not the creature, but the wood itself, shrieking as the thing thrashed, cracking the shafts.  

It climbed.  

Talons drove into the earth, dragging a body mangled into splinters and entrails.  

Its blood reeked—sweetness turned sour.  

I scrambled back, ribs grinding, and struck a match I had kept in my back pocket.  

The brushpile ignited with a *whump*, flames roaring upward.  

Light exposed the abomination.  

It *screamed*.  

The sound bypassed hearing, a pressure that vibrated deep in bone.  

A woodpecker fell dead from its roost, wings rigid, beak snapping.  

It charged through the flames.  

Fire melted its carapace, tarry ribbons sloughing off in smoking strips.  

I grabbed a burning branch, embers searing flesh to tendon, and drove it into the creature’s chest.  

The branch pierced the sac.  

It *convulsed*, jaws snapping shut inches from my face. A tooth grazed my temple, flaying skin from bone.  

We fell into the pyre.  

It thrashed beneath me, talons carving into my back, peeling skin that clung to its claws like shredded meat.  

I twisted the branch deeper, flames licking its heart.  

The fluid sprayed, scorching my chest, leaving burns etched into my skin.  

Its death rattle came—a wet gurgle, limbs twitching in final spasms.  

Then… stillness.  

Dawn found me crawling through ashes that clung to my burns like scarred skin. My hands were fused to the branch, flesh and wood joined in a blackened bond.  

The creature’s corpse lay half consumed, its torso cratered, bones jutting like antlers from the muck.  

Rain came, scrubbing its remains into the soil until only its teeth were left.  

Three days later, a search party found me in a talus field, knees shredded to raw meat from dragging myself over granite.  

They said it was a bear attack.  

I didn’t speak.  

I couldn’t explain what had really attacked me.  

The medic’s penlight stalled on my back—four slashes, too deep, too *clean* for any natural claw.  

The botanist refused to cross the tree line.  

She stood at its edge, haloed by deadwood, staring at the scarred trunks.  

The tooth now sits floating in formaldehyde, beside my father’s tarnished ranger badge.  

The woods don’t care about your redemption.  

If you go into them, if you think their silence will absolve you—know this, the trees have eyes that aren’t trees.  

The wind carries voices that aren’t wind.  

When your neck prickles and the chickadees fall silent, don’t pray.  

Don’t freeze.  

Run.  

Run not like a man, but like prey.  

If you have a knife, cling to it as if it’s your soul.  

If you have nothing, make a god out of your bones.  

It won’t stop.  

It *can’t*.  

You are not the first.  

Run until your boots disintegrate.  

Run until your lungs bleed.  

Run until you forget you were ever anything but meat.  

The wilderness is not a place.  

It is a mouth.  

And you are the prayer.  

And if you have a gun, save the last bullet for your head.
