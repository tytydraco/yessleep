Note: I couldn't think of anywhere else to post this, so I thought of this place.

I found the following ritual a few years ago, written on yellowed pages folded inside an esoteric book at my city's library. The book discusses psychic abilities and, primarily, the development of astral vision; most methods for opening the third eye involve raising consciousness through positive energies and increasing a person's vibrational frequency. What I found on those pages, however, revealed a blasphemous way to do it.

Procedure:

1. Initially, make sure you are clean and have an empty stomach; nothing can distract you during the ritual. This process must be performed between 3 AM and 4 AM.

2. Sit on the floor of any room (the smaller, the better) and make sure it is completely darkened; remember, the windows and doors must be closed. You should have a medium-sized mirror in your hand, which will rest in front of you, allowing you to see yourself and part of the room, which will be illuminated by three white candles (at least one must be between you and the mirror).

3. Begin the ritual seated in the lotus position, gazing at your own reflection. Then, slowly turn your neck completely to the left, and finally, do the same to the right. It is important that your mind absorbs the scenery at this point. Before continuing, use any blade to make a small cut, pour a tiny amount of blood onto the mirror, and spread it with your hand over the area where your reflection's face will be.

4. Sit comfortably between the candle and the mirror and spend the next few minutes looking at your reflection in the area between your eyebrows; do not look directly into its eyes. Under no circumstances should you look away from your surroundings (in the reflection or around you) and keep your gaze fixed on the defined point above the eyebrows of the reflection in front of you.

4. Let your vision slowly lose focus: you'll notice your features losing their sharpness and definition, plunging you into darkness. From that moment on, you'll notice the shadows you see in the mirror around you becoming denser; some may even move—don't look away. The air will likely cool at that moment, and the shadows will consume the light of any candles lit in the room. Some will take on tentacular shapes; don't blink until they disappear.

You've almost managed to open your third eye…

1. At some point, a humanoid form made of shadows may appear in the mirror's reflection; it will approach you like a mist, and something resembling hands will appear around your body and rest on your shoulders; the icy touch will awaken in you the urge to get up and run. But BEWARE, because if you do, the entity will consume you and your consciousness will be lost forever in the astral plane.

2. If you have resisted the creature's touch, you will notice a thin liquid oozing from your eyes and ears (do not touch it; do not move, it is not blood), which is not visible in your reflection at that moment. Suddenly, a small smile will appear on the face of what is looking back at you from the other side of the mirror, but it will no longer be part of your reflection.

3. The person in the mirror will move their hand and gently bring it closer to your forehead; you'll notice their hand following that movement. When you touch your forehead simultaneously, you'll hear a sharp, stabbing buzzing sound in your head and you'll want to throw it to the ground. However, under no circumstances should you move.

4. If you survive this frequency you will feel drowsy, and you will notice in the mirror that the shadows have already dissipated and the candles are once again swinging naturally in the room; Break the mirror with the same hand you used to cut yourself, but do not touch the pieces after they are on the floor, do it the next day, using your other hand.

5. Get up and blow out the candles. When you go to sleep, close your eyes and don't open them until dawn the next day; it will be a dreamless night. Upon waking, you will initially notice nothing different, but some people throughout the day will look at you differently, and when you try to look for them again, they will no longer be there. Shadows will be darker and will often move. If you live near a forest, you will notice small shapes darting through the trees in the densest and most remote areas of the city; do not follow them.

The new vision of the astral plane

Your newfound vision will allow you to glimpse the astral plane, but this ability will also attract the attention of entities that have waited centuries to be seen and understood. Some will bring you gifts and pay you homage. Others will be jealous of what you have gained and will come to torment you, causing horrific nightmares that often blur the lines with reality. The only way to keep them away is through bloodshed…

The process of opening the third eye is irreversible; only death will free you from sight.

Perhaps one day I'll have the courage to try this, and then I'll tell you what happens next.
