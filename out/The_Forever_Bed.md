“I’m here to participate in my yearly obligation and nothing else.” That’s what I repeat to myself over and over again as I walk into the quaint lobby filled with flowing flowery dresses and dapper three piece suits. “Welcome to Central Baptist Church,” said a shorter man with a warm smile reeling me in from the depths of my own mind, “I’ve never seen you here before. I’m glad you could join us this morning. What’s your name, son?” “Jason.” I said trying to keep our conversation as brief as possible. I was here because I felt like I had to be and no other reason. “Well it’s nice to meet you Jason. If you’d like to grab a coffee from our coffee bar over there, they’re free. Just tell them what you’d like and they’ll make it for you. The sanctuary is just through those doors there,” he gestured to the bright white doors on the back wall, “the service will begin in ten minutes. Let me know if you need anything.” And with that he was whisked away greeting others as they entered the church. 

One cup of stale coffee and an open seat on the old wooden pews later, I was sitting alone feeling out of place. My worn down jeans and faded blue polo stuck out in a sea of people dressed in their Sunday best. As I wait on the service to begin, I once again let my mind swim from my body to a different time. A time when I enjoyed going to church. 

I think back to the first time I was allowed in “big church” as my parents called it. I was no longer a kid trapped with bed wetters and screamers. Pride filled me as I reached this accomplishment, even if I couldn’t spell accomplishment. Walking into the sanctuary, flanked on each side by my parents, I had never felt so small. Ten foot tall stain glass windows filled the room with a kaleidoscope of colors. I looked up at my parents filled with joy and comfort. I was growing up. 

“Welcome church.” My mind drifts back to my body. “Happy Easter, everyone,” the slender bald man says as he takes his position at the pulpit,” It’s good to see you all here. Please open your bibles to Matthew 27 and we’ll get started.” His cheerful demeanor reminded me of my father. My parents were the only reason I was here today. Going to church on Sundays was one of the only times all three of us were together. Sundays were our day. Now that they’re gone, I can only bring myself to go to church once a year. It hurts so much to go without them, but it’s when I feel closest to them. My comfort is my affliction. Nine years they’ve been gone, nine times I’ve gone to church. 

“I’d like to thank all the guests for being here today,” the pastor continued as the congregation began to clap, “Easter Sunday is the perfect day to join a church,” eyes starting to drift my direction. Burying my nose in the Bible I picked up from the pew in front of me, he continues, “Let’s begin in verse-“ I stop listening. I try to sink in my seat and disappear from the eyes that were definitely watching me. 

“JASON MICHAEL!” I lift my eyes from Proverbs 16 that I was pretending to read. All eyes were on me. It had grown increasingly dark outside and I could barely see the pulpit anymore. The congregation stared at me in silence, waiting on a response. “Ye-yes?” The room grew darker still and as the darkness enveloped the stage, the pastor stood in front of the wooden cross on the wall with his arms stretched out in a mock crucifixion. His silhouette remained in front of the cross as a voice other than his slithered up the back of my neck and into my brain, “It’s time to rest.”

“You have avoided your pain for so long. You ran from your family. Ran from your problems. Ran from your God. Your desire even now is to run. To run from this place and never return,” All in unison the congregation says, “Deny your desires and allow the amalgamation of Heavenly Hosts to guide you to your Forever Bed.” 

The darkness covers every inch of air around me. I can see nothing. I know they are still there, staring at me. I can feel their eyes on me even in the void of the darkness. “We’ve watched you for years now,” he continues from somewhere in the darkness, “You are covered in fingerprints of Someone holy. We were not allowed to intervene. There are rules,” with each sentence, his voice came from somewhere else, as if he had become one with the black fog that hung over us, “No matter. You have come to us. Now we will guide you…” the darkness disappears in a breath, my eyes sting from the newfound light in the room.

I now stand in the aisle, flanked by the greeter, standing a foot shorter than me to my right, and the pastor, standing a foot taller than me to my left. They hold my hands with inhuman strength, staring forward toward the stage. I struggle to break free, but no luck. I bring my eyes up to the stage they were looking at. The wooden cross on the wall now has an opening below it. The preacher and the greeter start to walk towards it and I have no choice but to follow. As we walk up the stairs, i can see now that the opening leads to a cave. A tomb. My tomb. My Forever Bed.
