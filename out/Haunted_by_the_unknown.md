Five years ago, my wife (24F) and I (25M) moved into a new apartment after being shunned by our families due to certain events. The apartment was fairly average, but there was a constant, dull buzzing sound in the background. Initially, we didn't pay much attention to it, assuming it was just a noisy light or the refrigerator, since we hadn't noticed it during our initial viewing. However, after a few weeks, my wife became fed up with the noise and constantly nagged me to do something about it.

Reluctantly, I decided to take action and spent several days trying to pinpoint the source of the sound. I tried changing lightbulbs and closely observing the refrigerator, but I couldn't figure it out. I must have tested a dozen different lightbulbs in various fixtures throughout the apartment, but it proved impossible to resolve. Eventually, I gave up and called an electrician, but even they couldn't offer a satisfactory explanation for the noise.

This infuriated both myself and my wife, we felt we were the victims of a sick joke. With the noise mixed in with the fact that my wife had begun losing many personal items that meant a lot to her caused our lives to break down. The constant headaches and pain of this disruptive noise made it impossible to do simple things such as concentrating and doing chores around the apartment. The paranoia of the situation made me feel inhuman and afraid of what the deeper meaning behind this noise was and how the noise was unable to be pinpointed and discovered.

We spent the next few years searching for alternative places to live, but we couldn't find a suitable option. My wife worked for the local newspaper and wanted to stay close to her job, despite the inconveniences. Reluctantly, we resigned ourselves to our fate and continued living in the apartment. As time passed, the buzzing sound grew louder, interfering with our sleep and causing our relationship to deteriorate. We started having more frequent arguments, and my wife threatened to leave me numerous times if I didn't resolve the noise issue.
Looking back, I realise that I made an enormous mistake. This persistent noise over the past five years single-handedly destroyed my marriage, to the point where I believed my wife had no other choice but to leave. When she left abruptly without warning, it drove me into a deep state of madness. The combination of losing my wife and the constant noise was unbearable. In the following weeks, I lost my job, my friends, and my health deteriorated rapidly.

To make matters worse, I started hearing my wife's voice whispering to me, and the buzzing sound remained incessant, preventing me from even attempting to sleep. I went without sleep for four consecutive days until exhaustion finally overtook me, and I fell into a deep slumber. When I woke up, the buzzing had ceased, but I made a horrifying discoveryâ€”the lifeless and mutilated body of someone on my floor.
