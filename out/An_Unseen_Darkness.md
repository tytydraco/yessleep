My name is Dave, and I live in the quiet town of Selwood, Pennsylvania—a small place you won’t find on most maps, where the pace of life is as gentle as the breeze that stirs the leaves of ancient oaks lining our old streets. It's the kind of town where the unexpected becomes the stuff of late-night tales told in hushed tones. I’m sharing this because something unimaginable happened, and I still can't fully explain it.

I work as a translator at a local lawyer's office, a job that has me converting complex legalese from English to Spanish. It’s routine, steady work that pays well and isn't too demanding on my time. My wife, Milinda, works part-time as a caterer, balancing her professional responsibilities with caring for our young son, Evan. By afternoon, she’s home, shifting from work to motherhood with a grace that amazes me.

I've always been a night person; something about the evening stirs a deep, contemplative calm in me. The lack of city lights in our small town means the stars shine with an exceptional brilliance, casting a celestial glow over the simple landscape of our lives. Our ground-floor apartment in a modest four-apartment complex has a little garden, a patch of green that becomes a sanctuary where Milinda and I often wade into deep philosophical discussions under the starlit sky.

One such night, after a particularly engaging talk that ended with a shooting star arcing brightly across the sky, Milinda kissed me goodnight and went inside, leaving me alone with my thoughts. It was around 2 a.m., and the world had quieted to a whisper. That night, however, the silence felt heavier, more isolating, and as I decided to head in, the peculiar stillness of the early morning was about to give way to something far more sinister.

As I entered our bedroom and sat down beside my already sleeping wife, the air shifted dramatically. It became cold and damp, like a dense fog rolling over a coastal town, but this fog seemed to thicken with every passing second, making each breath feel like a laborious draw against a high-altitude wind. The room darkened unnaturally, as if shadows were swallowing every sliver of ambient light, enveloping me in an impenetrable blackness.

At first, I thought it might be a dream or a hallucination—a trick of the mind brought on by the late hour. But the chilling realization that this was no figment of my imagination came crashing down as I reached for my phone and felt nothing but the bizarre sensation of moving molecules under my fingertips, like touching the surface of water that was alive.

Panicking, I stumbled to the window, finding and yanking the shade open only to be met with more oppressive darkness. My heart pounded against my chest as I navigated from memory to the kitchen, fighting against what felt like gale-force winds in a room that should have been still.

Fumbling through the drawer, my hand finally clasped around a flashlight—one of several we kept for emergencies. The relief of touching something tangible was short-lived, however, as flipping the switch revealed a horror I couldn't have anticipated. The light didn’t illuminate the room but instead seemed to be absorbed by the darkness, reflecting back a dim glow that barely reached beyond its own length before being devoured by an unseen force.

I grabbed another flashlight, hoping the first was simply malfunctioning, but the result was terrifyingly the same. The light beams were sucked into a void, swallowed whole by whatever unnatural darkness had invaded my home. The shadows seemed alive, hungry, and utterly insatiable.

In a desperate bid for help, I yelled for Siri, and to my shock, she responded—a small beacon of hope in the consuming black. Relying on Siri's speech-to-text feature, I started to dictate this message into the void, not knowing where it would end up but hoping it would find its way into the hands of someone who could help, I pushed through the suffocating darkness towards Evan's room. My body felt heavy, each step a monumental effort against the swirling void around me.

If you’re reading this, I don’t know if I’ll make it out or if this nightmare will consume me. I'm recording this in hopes that somehow, through some miracle, it finds its way to someone who can help. To anyone in Selwood or planning to pass through, beware. Something inexplicable lurks here, in the shadows of this quiet town. Pray for us, and if you have any idea what might be happening, please, help.
