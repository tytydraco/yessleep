“Do you think Peter Parker ever gets tired of being Spider-Man?” Amelia asked, her voice cutting through the quiet of the room. She sat cross-legged next to me, eyes glued to the TV, but I could tell her mind was somewhere else.

I glanced over at her. “Do you?” I said, teasing. "You probably think he's too busy saving the world to ever get tired."

She shrugged, looking so serious. “I mean... yeah. But he never really gets a break, does he? Like, he’s always on call.” She paused, chewing on her bottom lip, probably thinking about how it must feel to have the weight of the world on your shoulders. “Do you ever get tired?”

I chuckled, giving her a playful nudge. "I mean, who doesn’t? But there’s no one else to do the job, right? If you stop, everything else stops with you. People need you, even when you're exhausted."

Her little face scrunched up in thought, and I could tell she was processing something deeper than I expected for a kid her age. I should have known—she was always asking the kinds of questions that made you rethink your own life. She didn’t even have to try, it was just the way she was.

“Like... mom?” she asked quietly, and I felt my heart tighten in my chest.

I looked down at my hands, thinking back to the days when I was her age, when the biggest worry was whether or not I’d get my favorite cereal for breakfast. How quickly that simple comfort fades. How things change.

"Yeah, like mom," I said softly, forcing a smile. "But you know, she's doing her best. We're all just trying to get by."

She nodded, looking thoughtful. "I guess," she said, her eyes flicking to the window briefly, the afternoon sun slanting through the blinds and casting stripes on the floor.

We’d been close ever since we were kids, despite the age gap between us—nine years—and the fact that we were half-sisters. We always joked about how she’d always believe whatever I told her. Sometimes it felt like I could tell her anything, and she’d just go along with it. I’ll never forget the time we were shopping at the grocery store, and I grabbed one of the self-scanners. I pointed it at her like I was scanning an item. *Beep!*

“One dollar,” I said, holding the scanner in front of her, “You cost one dollar.”

She stared at me for a moment, wide-eyed, processing it in her little brain. Then she nodded solemnly, as if the information was just part of life.

“I cost one dollar…” she repeated quietly, and from that moment on, for two years, she believed it. She’d walk around saying, “I’m worth one dollar!” with the biggest grin on her face. I was an asshole for messing with her like that, but it was always funny to see how much she trusted me. In a way, it made me feel proud to be her big sister.

Sitting here in my bed, we were just talking, as usual—about school, boys, her recent ADHD diagnosis. I was content in the kind of comfortable silence that only siblings who’ve been through a lot together can share.

Then, we heard a door being slammed followed by my mom's voice from downstairs, sharp and impatient, calling up to us.

“What’s for dinner?”

Amelia and I exchanged a quick glance. We both silently agreed: we’d already eaten. Pizza. The thing is, I knew Mom would get upset if we didn’t ask her to join us, but I also knew she was working late again, leaving us to fend for ourselves most evenings.

“We’re not hungry!” I called back, relieved at how easy it was to avoid the usual battle.

There was a long pause. Then I heard her footsteps climbing the stairs. I didn’t say anything else. We just sat there on the bed, watching the movie, pretending like everything was fine.

But then, there was a slight shift in the air. It was subtle, just a small change that made the back of my neck prickle. A chill that wasn’t there before. And then... the creak of the door.

She entered.

Mom’s face was pale, too pale, as though all the color had drained out of her. Her eyes were wide and distant, like she was seeing something I couldn’t. Fear—or maybe sadness—flickered behind her gaze. Her lips trembled as she stepped into the room.

Something was wrong.

"Vanessa… You have to let her go," she said, voice cracking.

I didn’t answer. I didn’t know what to say. The words didn’t make sense. I turned to look at Amelia, whose hand rested in mine, her fingers curled lightly around mine. For a moment, I thought everything was fine. But then it hit me—her hand was cold. Not just cold, but like... ice. Like the kind of cold you feel when someone’s been dead for hours.

I looked down at my sister’s face again. The flickering image of her small, lifeless body sent a wave of nausea crashing over me.

I blinked, and suddenly everything felt… wrong.

She was gone.

I looked down at my hand. The warmth of her hand was gone. My heart hammered in my chest, and I wanted to scream. But the scream never came.

Then, just as quickly as it happened, everything around me blinked. A flash. A moment where the world shifted again.

I was no longer sitting in my room.

I was somewhere else. The room was cold, dark. It wasn’t my bed. It wasn’t even my house.

I gasped awake, my body trembling, soaked in sweat. My sheets tangled around me, and for a split second, I felt disoriented. A weight in the air. That same sense of dread that had filled the dream clung to me.

Amelia was asleep in the next room, her breathing soft and steady, like nothing had changed. I reached for my phone, trying to shake off the lingering feeling that something was wrong. A message.

A single text.

From an unknown number.

*“You should have let her go, Vanessa.”*

My pulse quickened as I stared at the screen, my skin crawling with cold.

I rushed to Amelia’s room. She was still asleep, just like before. I pressed my hand to her forehead, feeling the steady warmth of her skin. She was real. She was here.

But the nightmare… it was still there too. Still lingering in the corners of my mind.

I didn’t know what had just happened.

The nightmare wasn’t over.

Not yet.
