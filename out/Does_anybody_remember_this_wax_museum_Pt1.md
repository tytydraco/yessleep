I have this vivid memory from when I was a child. It was a school field trip I took in middle school but I’ve asked my former classmates and no one remembers it. My old teachers and even my family do not remember despite having to sign off the papers and pay for it.  

It was a longish field trip, a drive over the bridge to Pennsylvania. I remember I was excited as I sat alone on the back of the bus watching the road go by. I remember they told us we were going to a museum or something like that, maybe an art exhibit but I swear they told us it was some kind of museum. 

Strangely enough, I don’t remember arriving so I have no idea what the building looked like outside or where it was located but the inside was strange. It had a medium brown colored hard wood floor and was styled like many of the areas Victorian style homes. Delicate wood stairs, many rooms, a large foyer and wooden accents and railings painted a pale pink-purple color. It was clean but it felt old, the cracks were dark and the wood was creaky. 

We had a young lady showing us around, bringing us to each room after checking us in. Some of my classmates were busy buzzing about something in particular though. Upon listening, I heard them gossiping about a ‘haunted’ wax figure. Supposedly no one had ever spent more than 7 minutes looking into her eyes before having panic attacks, heart attacks and scary visions resulting in a lifelong curse. As we started to move about the rooms, the docent regaled us with the tail of the artist of all the strange wax creatures. The artist was a horror artist who made crazy displays of horror icons, creepy sculptures, mythological creatures, demons, and Gods. 

Amongst the strange and life-like wax sculptures were many recognizable figures such as a towering and snarling wolf man and a life-sized depiction of the Goddess Kali holding swords and a demonic head. This sounds like a really cool field trip and it was, especially for a 2000s kid with little internet access. However, considering I went to a private Catholic school who didn’t even let us celebrate Halloween, this was a weird pick. When we got to the end of the hallway there was a room ahead with the haunted attraction. 

I’m starting to have a weird headache while writing this so I’ll stop here and finish up when I can. It gets weirder from here, but all I have in me is enough strength to post this. 

I’ll be back with the rest…this can’t be a dream. 

It was too real. 

She was too real. 

Her skin was too real, her eyes were too detailed, even the fingerprints on her long wrinkly fingers were too real. I swear I could even recall the smell of nail polish for those ghastly long and sharp claw-like nails of hers.
