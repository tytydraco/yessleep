Something very strange has been happening to me this past week. Like the title says the statue is changing. I've been keeping a journal. I won't go into too much detail here, I'll let my journal tell what happened. I don't care who thinks I'm crazy anymore.

December 9

I don't know how to start this. I don't even know if I believe my own eyes. I noticed it the other day maybe Wednesday or Thursday. I can't remember which, but I almost didn't see it. Outside of my apartment in the courtyard there's this statue of some man. He has some significance to this town, but I don't remember. I just moved here last month and I read the plaque at the base of the statue the day I moved in. I can't remember what it said at all though. One of the founders or some mayor maybe? I DO remember what the statue looked like: it was tall about 15 - 18 feet, it had that aged bronze or brass color with the deep browns that eased into the blackened parts of the metal, the man himself was older maybe early to mid-fifties, he wore a suit without a tie, and lastly his arms were holding his jacket just below the lapels. That last part is the most important because the other day his arms were in a different spot. They had both moved up to just below the collar.

When I walked by that day, I got a sense I was being watched from above. I shot my eyes up to the windows in my building, but most of the curtains were drawn and the lights were off in the open ones. Then I looked towards the statue. I pass by it everyday going to and from wherever; work mostly. Something struck me as being off this time. I first thought that the shadows were off or the morning winter sun was hitting it differently than I was used to. I walked on not giving it too much thought. That evening, as I was coming home and dusk had already given way to night, the spotlight that illuminated the statue from below confirmed my unease from earlier. His arms, I thought to myself, his arms weren't like that before. I immediately shook the feeling away. *Get it together, Jen. You're just tired.* That's how felt the next day, and by the third I had forgotten about the strange feeling I got from the statue. Or, at least, nearly forgotten. 

Today, it changed again. I shrugged it off before, but now I know for sure that I was right. Rather than both hands firmly grasping the lapels just below the collar of the shirt, the left hand held the lapel while the right hand was frozen mid-wave by his head. I must have stared at it for three minutes before stopping someone walking through the courtyard. "Excuse me," I said, "you live in this building, too, don't you?" The man looked a little annoyed at first but stopped and said, "yes, I do." I gestured to the statue. "Does anything seem off about the statue today?" His look turned from annoyance to puzzled. He looked up, "this old thing? Still looks the same to me. Smug face and all." He said the last part as he continued his walk. "Okay, thanks," I said after him. I shook my head and went to work. When I got home today, I started writing this journal. Just so I can keep track of it and organize my thoughts. Who knows, maybe it will never happen again.

Well, it moved again. I feel like my eyes are playing tricks on me. I got up and went to work, but I was running late this morning so I sprinted straight by without thinking. When I got home I remembered to check on the statue's position after I got the feeling of being watched again. His head was tilted down. Instead of looking straight ahead like he had been, he now looked down at the people below him. At this point I don't know how I should feel about it. I know I'm not crazy, I've noticed three different poses it's taken. I don't know if I should contact the authorities or not. What would they say? What would they do? 

As I stood there studying the statue again, I asked a woman as she passed by, "I'm sorry, ma'am, have you got a moment?" She turned towards me and said, "yes?" The word formed a cloud of frost in front of her face. "I'm sorry," I apologized again, "what do you know about the statue here?" She turned her head towards it then back. "Not much more than what's written on the plaque," she said pointing to the base. "And does it seem strange to you?" I looked at her hoping for a satisfying answer. "Well," she said, "I always thought it was creepy how it stared down at people. Ever since I moved here, I was felt like I was being watched by it." Then I asked, "and how long have you lived here?" She looked up in contemplation, "let's see, it'll be six years in February." I stood there shocked, snow had started to gently fall. *Six years?* The statue looked different not two days ago... Right? That's what I wrote down. What is going on? 

I thanked her and we parted ways. I'm sitting on the window nook as I write this down. I keep looking down at that statue. I started to wonder if it felt my eyes like how I felt it's on me. I'm tired now. 

December 12

The gentle snow that started last night must have taken a rapid turn into blizzard territory. It is currently 5:43 a.m. and the weather channel says the snow has reached four and a half feet. It is still coming down pretty hard still but not as hard as it must have last night. I looked out the window and saw nothing. Between the dark morning and heavy cloud coverage there wasn't any way to see the statue. After calling my boss and confirming we wouldn't be going in today, I started coffee maker and turned on my computer. If I was going to be up this early I might as well get some work done. Thankfully my job didn't actually require me to clock in at the office. I could do that from anywhere. After pouring a mug, I sat down and got to work.

Next thing I know it's 2:54 p.m. I didn't even eat. The snow officially stopped an hour ago, but the clouds still grey out the sun's rays. As I walked towards the window a deep sense of dread washed over my body. I shivered the feeling away; still I hesitated to look out of the window. I had every right to be creeped out. *No, there's no way that's possible.* The statue was now looking up at my window, hand still raised, waving. I threw the curtains closed and started backing up. "No. No way. It's just not possible," I spoke out loud this time. I almost tripped over my coffee table. I felt like my head was swimming. I sat on the edge of table for a long time waiting for the explanation to make itself known. After a few minutes I found myself standing and staring back out the window. *The snow.* I just noticed there wasn't a flake of snow anywhere on statue. Not even the concrete base, which was about four foot tall.
I feel like it's targeting me now. 

December 13

I barely got any sleep at all last night. My dreams were filled with a silent and giant adversary that got closer if I blinked or looked away for a millisecond. 

The city must have cleared paths last night. I went to the window and saw the snow was pushed away in the roads and even the courtyard. On my walk to work I ran into the same woman from the other day. She smiled as we were approaching each other and I nodded and smiled back. I looked at the statue; it wasn't even trying to be subtle anymore. It was saluting and looking straight ahead. It was dressed in military garb. My dad was a captain in the Air Force and the statue's outfit looked identical.

I was so confused. How was the statue moving? Why doesn't anyone else notice the changes? Why me? I called out of work, feigning pneumonia and headed back inside. 

December 14

I decided to call the authorities on my walk home this evening. The statue (base and all) had moved from the center of the courtyard to directly under my window this window.

"Maybrook Police Department," the man said. "Hi, my name Jennifer Winslet. I live in the Maybrook Hills Building on 5th Avenue. This is going to sound crazy..." I hesitated for a moment. "Go on, Miss Winslet," the operator coaxed. "I doubt we haven't heard it before." *Wanna bet?* "Well, you see sir, the statue outside the building... keeps moving," I said the last part fast. "I'm sorry, ma'am. You said the statue is moving?" I heard the disbelief. "Yes, sir," I responded. "Moving how," he asked, "like by vandals?" 

"More like on its own. Changing poses and positions in the courtyard," I answered followed by a pause that echoed throughout history but was over in a second. "Miss Winslet, are you on any medication?" He doesn't believe me. Of course he doesn't. "No, I'm not," I said. "Using any illicit substances, such as; heroin or methamphetamine?" I sighed heavy, "no, I'm not. And I'm not drunk either. I know how it sounds. I-" He cut me off. "Miss Winslet, if it will make you feel better we'll send over a couple of officers to check it out. Sound good?" I thanked him and hung up the phone.

I sat by the window and waited for them to pull up. To my surprise, they showed up and got out of the cruiser. I rushed down to meet them at the base. "Miss Winslet?" The younger of the two asked as I running over to them. "Yes, officer, I was afraid you wouldn't show." The older one grunted, "just be thankful it's a slow night." They looked the statue over haphazardly then they looked back at me. "Well, ma'am, in my opinion: it's a statue," the young one chided. The older one elbowed him. "What Sargent Burns means is that this is how the statue has always looked since it was built in the '40s. Not an inch out of place." I thanked them even though I was unsatisfied with their response. I went back to my apartment defeated.

After I that I went to bed. As I lay there I decided I would transcribe and post it here to see if anyone had any suggestions. I thought I'd be posting this tomorrow, but I was woken up by a large rumbling that shook the whole building. I got up and checked the hallway, but no one else seemed to notice. Then as I turned around, my eyes caught an unfamiliar glint of moonlight through the window. I slowly made my way over to my laptop. That's where I am now. Stuck in my stupid apartment with that thing outside my window. He's grin has extended to an unnatural and demented smile.
