I woke in an instant, my brain restarting before my eyes and ears. I sat up and felt an intense pain as my forehead collided with something metal. I lay in a coffin shaped object packed with a hard foam around my legs not allowing me enough room to kick free. The claustrophobic effect made it hard to breathe. Panic began to set in as I screamed out the last air of my lungs into the void. 

The low hum of machinery echoed in my ears, and I felt myself moving as if on an elevator. My screams fell to silence over the hum, and it slowly dug into my skull eating at my brain. When at last I felt as though I was going to break into a mind ending insanity. The elevator jolted to a stop making my face smack hard against the metal. 

A whirring of machinery sounded, and latches began to unclick one by one, dozens of them as a small sliver of light began to cut its way through the darkness. The sight blinded my eyes; my panic began to emerge once more, but I quelled it under my desperation to escape. My hands and knees began to press hard against the lid of my prison. With an audible pop the lid flew off to the side a dusty grimy light flooded in to greet me. I scrambled out of the coffin and collapsed to the ground. My legs felt weak as though I hadn't used them in a long time. I lay there rubbing the feeling back into them as I gazed around where I was. 

It was a dingy brown room. A scent of smoke and grease lingered in the air with an acrid taste of metal. No windows grace the walls of my new prison but a dim orange light in every corner of the room gave life to the area. A single door with blocky letters on it was the only source of attention. "Factorium." It read. I got to my feet slowly using a rusted-out handrail that surrounded the, when I noticed something else that was odd. On the back of my left palm was the number 42. It stood out bold and black as if tattooed. 

I climbed up the coffin noticing the tight confines of my precious prison. It was shaped perfectly for my body as if formed around me like liquid. As I took my first real step away. A loud clang filled my ears, and I turned in time to watch the coffin shaped elevator descend into the floor. A rusty metal door slid on top of it cutting me off. I jumped at it, my only means of escape disappearing into the perfectly seamless floor. 

With little resolution I turned my back on the past and headed towards the only door. Angry machinery greeted me with a cloud of smoke. Dozens of machines whirred and buzzed as their mechanical arms rotated up and down. Gears mashed together giving me sensory overload. This was like nothing I had seen before. The room was a smoky mess, it made my head feel dizzy and I couldn’t breathe properly. I dropped to one knee, keeping below the haze and my mind cleared allowing me to calm myself.

When it hit me, who was I? How did I come to be here? Where was I? Why couldn't I remember anything about my past? 

Before my thoughts could hold me down. A large buzzer erupted beside my head setting off a red flashing light. I had no choice but to escape the ear-splitting hammer of the horns bugle; I moved through the machinery towards the opposite side of Factorium. 

Through the maze of machinery, I found another brown dingy doorway. Lit up by the flashing red lights. A blocky frame held the word “Break Room”. I made my way through the door into an utterly unexpected room that regarded an old lunchroom at a dingy factory from long past. A coffee pot covered in dust and misuse sat on the counter looking dejected and alone. An old couch stood vigil with its dyed brown fabric covered with layers of dirt and grease as if it had been used more than anything. A single table and chair made of solid enough looking metal legs and vinyl top sat in one corner next to an odd-looking vending machine that dominated the center of the room. Next to it on the wall beside the entrance was a futuristic looking television screen, oddly out of place and warranted further inspection. It was the only thing not covered in dust as it sat silent but drawing the eye none the less. A small hole beneath it made me pause before I continued on.

Another doorway labeled “Bunks” sat next to a dirty countertop with an ancient looking rag and bucket resting on top. I tried the handle, but the door was locked firmly. I bumped my hip into it hoping to dislodge it, but it stayed firm as if a barrier between myself and its secrets. 

I glanced around the room and sat heavily on the couch. A cloud of dust billowed around me making me cough as I waved it away. A triumphant bugle played from somewhere in the room. The monitor by the door lit up with a rainbow of colours, distinctly contrasting the odd environment I had gotten myself trapped in. 

The bugle played loudly again as if declaring a great event and I made my way over to stand in front of it. With a blinding beam, a blast of light shot out at me as if it was scanning me. 

"Congratulations! Number 42!" It wrote across the screen in bright letters. 

"You have personally been selected to the great honour of maintaining Factorium, a great place to work if you don't mind me saying. Ha ha." It even wrote in the ha ha I noticed, and I just stood their overwhelmed. 

"I'm sure as you have already noticed, this facility is provided with top-of-the-line accommodations but to unlock its full potential you will have the honour of collecting tokens! As a show of kindness, I will now donate you one free token to use at your discretion. Congratulations! You have earned one token." 

A small rattling noise like a vending machine dispensing a coin rattled and a bright yellow poker chip appeared at the bottom of the monitor through a coin slot. 

"Thank you." I said shakily. 

"No thanks needed number 42. You may notice to use a lot of Factorium’s areas and perks you require tokens. For example, the bunks area is only unlocked after you insert five tokens into the slot next to it. The vending machine supplies all essentials for hygiene and nutrition. We offer a variety of delicious options to eat and drink." 

The screen fluttered and a list of tasks flooded the screen. 

1. Maintain all the pumps. Each bucket of sludge removed from the gears and deposited into the chute will receive one token. You need to pull the handle to pause the machine for fifteen seconds. 

2. Clean the headquarters. Too much dust is a bad thing. You will receive one token upon completion. 

3. Unblock the grate, that supplies the liquid into the pipes. You will receive two tokens. 

"What are these tasks? Where am I? What is going on? Who am I?" I asked it unsure of what to say or think. 

"You are in Factorium 42. These tasks are why you are here, and you have signed a contract stipulating your employment for 365 days. One year to be precise, after such a time as per your contract you will be retired and replaced." 

"Is no one else here?" I asked. 

"No one but you and me 42." It replied ominously. 

"Who are you?" I asked it. 

"I am the Overseer. But you may call me just the Overseer ha ha." It typed. 

"What they're the same thing." I said confused. 

"See it's what you would call a joke 42." It typed. 

"I see." Was all I said. My head spinning. 

"Please perform your tasks 42." It finished. 

A list of the 3 tasks lit up on the screen and I memorized them as best I could. My head was swimming from the smell of smoke in the air and the distant hum of machinery that never seemed to go away.

“Please insert your hand into the hand shaped hole below. Your non dominant hand if you please.” Overseer typed generating an arrow pointing towards the bottom right of the screen.

“Like this?” I asked sticking my arm into the hole feeling the circular metal of the tube as it went all the way to my left elbow.

“Please grip the handle with all fingers.” Overseer wrote.
An intense pain shot up my arm as something clamped onto my forearm. Needles dug into my skin from multiple access points and when I tried to remove my arm, I found that it was locked tight. The pain increased as drills sounded in the wall making me scream and writhe in pain, unable to control my rage and pain levels, I dropped to my knees.

 A bugle sounded from the machine, and I felt my arm slacken as it was freed. My arm came out wearing a large wristband with a small screen on it. The skin around where it had attached was red and raw, laced with small traces of blood. A smiley face popped up on the screen and Overseer typed a message on both screens.

“Congratulations 42, on a successful assimilation with your personal PDA. Your daily tasks will be displayed here as well as some instructions and tips on how to finish those tasks. You can also ask me any questions, and I will answer to the best of my ability.” 

“What the hell was that?” I asked, my voice raw from my screams.

“Pardon for the pain, but your PDA needed to be attached securely. It is your lifeline.” Overseer explained ignoring the main point of my question.

“Please proceed back to Factorium for further instructions on how to maintain the pumps.” Overseer wrote on my PDA his smiley face changing into an arrow that pointed at the door heading back to the main factory floor.

I re-entered Factorium and my foot grazed a metal bucket. I swear it hadn't been there before, or I would have seen it. It was a grey shiny metal and about the size of a milk pail. 

The hum of machinery echoed through my body making me wish for any form of earplug. I made my way down the rows. Examining the dozens of machines all running in tune with each other. The up and down motions perfect and synced.

My PDA dinged and flashed red. Its dings were constant and became increasingly louder as I coughed from the amount of smoke billowing out of the pump machines that cycled up and down like an oil derrick. Each machine had a bright red lever on one side and a small grate like mouth. At the top of each machine was a series of lights, all of them were green except the machine closest to me. It had turned red and flashed in time with my new PDA bracelet.

A sad smiley face, showed on the screen with each flash and Overseer typed a message.

“Pull the lever to open the grate, you will have fifteen seconds to clear the machine of the solid material thus freeing the gears. The machines cannot fall out of sync; your main job is to maintain the machines. It is of the utmost urgency, any failure to comply will result in loss of tokens and retribution.”

“What does that mean? Retribution?” I asked, wondering what sick punishment was linked with this disturbing place I had found myself working in.

“Retribution is defined as, punishment inflicted on someone as vengeance for a wrong or criminal act.” Overseer typed simply dodging my question again.

“That’s not what I meant.” I replied to my wrist, feeling foolish.

“Please perform the task as instructed.” Overseer replied while the screen turned slowly red.

With a heavy clunk, I pulled the lever on the pump downwards and with effort the grate clanged open, I walked around the machine with my bucket and reached into the core of the machine. My arm touching a black sludge that was turning solid. I took it away in handfuls and filled half my bucket quickly, I reached for one last handful and my finger grazed the sharp gear like teeth of the machine. Blood welled on my finger as it cut a small but deep cut into my thumb. The sludge smelled foul like smoke and death, without even needing to ask I knew it had to be some form of sewage being pumped through these machines, they were pumping some form of toxic waste. The cut on my finger got sludge on it and I rubbed my hand against my shirt hoping to clean it.

The siren exploded in my ears and the grate slammed closed by itself as the machine began to whir into life, I watched as the sludge began to pump again through the gears, a deep black liquid that flowed down through the top of the machine rotating the gears inside and allowing the machine to sync with the others.

“Good job, once you fill that bucket, you can dump the contents into the machine by the Break Room. It will supply you with one token per bucket full of the material.” Overseer declared as I wiped my hands and sucked on my thumb stemming the bleeding.

“Do you have any gloves I could have?” I asked Overseer.

“Gloves cost three tokens in the break room.” Overseer responded.

“That’s ridiculous, what about water?” I asked getting annoyed as I made my way back towards the Break Room. 

“Water is only one token. A fair system I would say. Don't you think?” Overseer said displaying a smiley face one more, this machines empty empathy was really starting to dig into my already bad temper.

“Whatever, where do I dump this stuff.” I said noticing a small alcove off to the side behind the machines.

As I approached my PDA dinged showing me an arrow to follow. It led me down the alcove and I came to a rudimentary work area; large tables covered in lights and tools dominated the room. The tables were stained with the black sludge of the machines. A large chute door stood in the center of the room. On the wall above it was an arrow carved into the metal with some sharp object a few words.

“You can fill the buckets with anything; O will never know the difference. Stupid AI, easy tokens. 41.”

The message had been signed with the number 41. As if the person before me had worked the same shift, done these same tasks. Did that mean 41 people had worked in this place before me, had this insane bracelet surgically attached to them and forced to pay for things with tokens.

My bracelet exploded in alarm making me jump. A red light flashed quickly making me panic for a moment, an arrow led me to another machine with a blinking red light. A siren sounded in the corner of Factorium near where the Coffin room was. I pulled the lever as Overseer sent me another message.

“Faster 42. These machines cannot fall out of sync.” 

I dug my hand into the sludge, filling the rest of my bucket as my fingers turned black with the foul smelling taint. As I grabbed the last chunk from the machine, the gears sliced my index finger drawing blood. I cursed and held my finger against my side as the grate slammed shut seconds after I removed my hand. My PDA dinged loudly as instructions flashed.

“Reset the lever 42, there seems to be a problem with its auto restart.” Overseer commanded.
As I pulled the lever I noticed another message from 41 scratched into the machine.
“This one’s crap, flip lever.” It said signing the bottom with 41.

I took a mental note of the machine's location and carried the black tar like substance to the chute; with one hand I wrenched the heavy door open as a strong smell took me in the nose. The chute smelled of rotting garbage. I felt bile jump to the back of my throat as I stifled my reaction. I braced myself and dumped the sludge into the blackness of the chute. 

A small change bowl built into the wall rattled as a single token rolled out coming to a stop in front of me. My black fingers smudging the yellow poker chip as I pocketed it. My head began to spin from the smoke billowing out of the dozens of machines. My bracelet dinged red once more as another of the machines went down. I dropped to one knee breathing fast, whatever was happening to me was happening fast. My vision swam in my head as if full of fish.

Overseer dinged my bracelet again, a message appearing.

“You seem to be suffering from a common side effect of working here. Smoke inhalation, please proceed to the Break Room and purchase an inhaler from the vending machine.” 

I crawled my way back the short distance to the Break Room my lungs coughing and hacking as I overworked myself. My vision began to darken as I made it inside the Break Room and closed the door behind me. The vending machine that dominated the middle of the room lit up in flashing lights, drawing my eye. The screen was a deep purple with green lettering, like a video game menu. Flashing arrows and input keys lit up the bottom half of the screen. The third option was air inhaler for one token. I pressed the down arrow twice and hit dispense on the machine. A large error message played, Insufficient funds. A slot on the right of the machine lit up bright and yellow. I jammed a token in the slot my hands feeling weak and sluggish as my mind still reeled from the smoke. With pained efforts I dispensed the air inhaler as I dropped to my knee again the nauseous feeling taking its toll.

A slot in the bottom of the machine opened as an item clanged down the chute. A bright green inhaler, like the kind you would see in hospitals. I grabbed it and inserted the one end into my shaking lips. With a firm press I descended the canister and felt a large blast enter my lungs. Instantly I felt better and after two more hits of the medicine. The inhaler emptied leaving me feeling remarkably better. I sat with my back on the machine breathing heavily as my head cleared and I was able to stand once more. 

With shaking hands, I scrolled through the vending machine seeing everything I could buy. The list seemed to go on for ever, most things I would need would be purchasable in this machine. Food items, water bottles, even clothing, and equipment. The machine had bright colours like a slot machine, and it made me feel like a kid at an arcade.

Overseer dinged my bracelet.

“The pumps 42. Do not let them get out of sync.” 

I opened the door to the Break Room and gazed out upon Factorium. The mechanical machines pumping and whirring, their large arms pumping up and down. As I watched, one red light turned on down the row. Then another, and another. My PDA dinged again and again as a siren sounded off on the far side of the room. I coughed as I covered my mouth with my shirt. My blackened hands grabbing my metal bucket as I fought through the smoke towards the first red light. This was going to be hell, but there was nowhere for me to go.
