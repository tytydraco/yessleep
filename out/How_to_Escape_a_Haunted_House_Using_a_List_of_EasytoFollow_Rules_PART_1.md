The tall skinny man approached with slow steps. My friends and I could barely hold our laughter.

“That’s a funny way of dressing, mister. Are you with the circus in town? Do you know any magic tricks?” Eddie said, snorting. He liked joking around a lot.

The man’s uncanny appearance made him look like one of those people who sell you fake lottery tickets or revolutionary air conditioners you could fit in your pocket.  He wore a double-breasted black and red pinstripe suit with a black satin tie. His smile looked deceiving, and his eyes held thousands of secrets. He had a fancy old walking cane with a golden lion head as a handle. The gravel crushed under his black leather shoes. His black top hat absorbed the sunlight, adding even more to his mysterious aura.

“Hi there, kids! Well, you are right, young Edward! You are very right! I used to work for a circus a long time ago, but now I decided to venture into a solo business!” the man said in a low-pitched voice. “Please, allow me to introduce myself—name’s Edgar Verlice. At your service!” the odd man said. He took a bow before us in slow-motion. The tune of his creaking bones made me uneasy.

“How the hell do you know my name?” Eddie said, rising from his sitting position. At that point, I felt a tingling sensation crawling up my spine. We glanced at each other as tension built up in the air.

“Woah there, easy now. Do not be afraid! I’m a magician, after all. That’s how I know your names. And what I also know is that magic is real! Would you like to see a trick?”

“Yes, I do! Can you magically make a bunny appear?” Cassandra said, clapping her hands.

“Oh, aren’t you a bunch of lovely kids?” Edgar said, mimicking Cassandra’s gesture. “I have something even better than a bunny, Cassandra! How about $100 for each of you if you let me give you a tour of my haunted house? What do you say?”

“Well, now you’re talking, mister Verlice,” said Vince. He snorted and spat on the ground. “You have a haunted house? Is it a rigged one or the real deal?”

“I will let you kids decide. All you have to do is stay inside for one night. If you all get out, you get $1000 each. I think you can imagine that it will not be an easy task, and there will be a lot of hard challenges you must pass,” Verlice said, producing a large silver key from his right side pocket.

“I mean, all that money could do us good, guys,” I said while looking after the key he waved around in the cool autumn air.

“Indeed, it could help you buy that console you’ve always wanted, Henry. Plus some extra games, right? Besides, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. My house isn’t open to the public, and admission is by invitation only. I moved it around the country all year, trying to find the bravest children. I’m hoping I’m not wrong when I say you are brave, yes?” the thin man said, now holding the key before my eyes.

The way he said all our names felt very unsettling. Something about this man made me uncomfortable, but it felt like a kick in our pride if we had said no to his challenge.

“Of course, you are not wrong. We ain’t afraid of anything!” said Emma, putting her phone in her back pocket.

“I didn’t expect less of you, brave young kids. Can I say, Emma, that I love how you dyed your hair? All those rainbow colors look stunning!” Verlice said, grinning.

That felt awkward and cringey.

“Thanks, I guess,” she replied.

“Can I ask, how do you move your house around the country? It seems a difficult process to do that,” said David flicking a cigarette butt.

“Stop littering, David!” cried Emma, picking up the butt and handing it back to him.

“Sorry, I forget sometimes. Lucky me that you are the voice of reason,” he replied, rolling his eyes ironically. “Can we go home now? I don’t like this guy. Screw his money.”

“Come on, dude. It’s going to be fun,” Emma replied.

David puffed, rolling his eyes again.

“To answer your question, David… The house floats around the country. I move it around using magic, and it can appear wherever I want it to. I call it the Floating House. Its residents always like it when they see a new place such as your beautiful little town,” Verlice said.

“I swear this is the most awkward advertisement pitch if I’ve ever heard one,” said Eddie, irritated. “You expect us to believe you? It smells like horseshit to me. And guess what, no matter how much gold you put on shit, it’s still shit.”

Verlice said that he didn’t expect us to believe him. He still handed us the $100 bills and told us to be at the clearing in the woods at midnight sharp.

“That’s where the house will be. I’m sure you know there was nothing there until a few days ago. If you see the house, you will know I mean business. After all, you kids are brave and like challenges. It’s all fun and games, and you get to win a lot of money,” Verlice said as he handed me the key.

He told me to take it and use it to open the front door. Then he told us that inside, we would find a list of strict rules we had to follow during our stay in the house. Under no circumstance would we deviate from them.

“And you expect one or some of us would be stupid enough and break the rules. And then we would fail the challenge. I have seen many movies and read many books, and I know you are safe if you follow the rules. If not, then you’re dead meat,” said Vince, checking to see if the $100 bill was real. “Seems legit.”

“Alright, children. I think you have had enough of me for now. How about seeing each other at the end of this haunted house adventure? I’ll be waiting for you with open arms and one thousand dollars each!” Verlice exclaimed, rubbing his hands together.

“Can you show us a bit of magic so we know you’re not a fraud?” inquired David, calm and collected as a sniper on the battlefield.

“Why, of course, I can, David! How about you think of a number between one and ten thousand? You can even whisper it to some of your friends here before I say it,” Verlice said, turning his back. “Let me know when you’re ready, Dave! I’ll even cover my ears!”

David gathered everyone in a circle, and we sat as if in a rugby scrum. “Alright, boys and girls. Let’s send this asshole home. I’m thinking of the number 7256. It’s as random as I can make it. He can’t guess it, right?” he whispered.

“Not a chance in hell, man,” Vince replied.

We broke the circle, and David told Verlice he had picked a number.

“Alright, young man. Your face looks full of determination and discipline, and I’m sure you think you made this a hard guess for me. I can assure you that this is not the case, and I always get these things right. Call me a mind reader, call me a magician, call me the devil, or just a lucky man, but I know that your number is 7256,” Verlice said, and that poisonous grin appeared on his face again.

“How the…” David didn’t get to finish his sentence. He stood there frozen in disbelief.

“Your favorite food is pizza, and your favorite color is blue. Three years ago, you got stung by a bee and almost died from anaphylactic shock. Luckily, you got administered epinephrine, and Dr. Meadows saved your life. Cassandra, your grandfather built this town and made it flourish and become the diamond it is today. I could go on forever talking about everything, but you might get bored. I could show you a card trick, make pigeons appear from thin air; I could change the weather. You think of a thing that seems impossible, and I can do it,” Verlice said, rolling his eyes.

I felt all blood drain from my face, and the air bore a gravelike silence. The more I looked at him talking, the dizzier I got. The whole world spun around me, and I prayed for the moment when he would go away and leave us the hell alone.

Yet, I felt we had no choice but to do what he said.  In a way, we felt his enormous power even though he only used a fraction of it to control our minds, answers, and decisions. His hypnotic stare, the way he articulated some words, and how he persuaded us to go and take a tour of his haunted house spoke volumes about how vicious he was. I felt in the depths of my soul that he was much more than the eye met.

He waved goodbye and told us to arrive on time, which meant not a second later than midnight. We all watched him getting smaller and smaller until he finally went out of view on the winding roads.

“Did you guys feel it too? The way he made us listen to every word he said. God damn it, now I have a huge headache,” David said, massaging his temples.

“Yeah, it’s like he held us captive in some invisible shackles and played with our minds,” Emma said, her hands shaking uncontrollably. “I’m scared, guys. I’m terrified to go to that place.”

“I am too, but I don’t think we have a choice, do we? We took his money or better said, he made us take his money, and now we have to play his game. I can’t imagine what he’ll do to us if we don’t hold our end of the deal,” said Cassandra.

“Damn it. It looks like we have no other choice than to go,” I said, biting my nails as I felt my heart falling into the claws of absolute dread.

We didn’t say much on our way home. Maybe it was out of fear; maybe Verlice did something to our minds. His infectious grin poisoned the back of my head; it plastered itself there like growing cancer, ever-expanding and corrupting everything in its wake.

The hours passed, and midnight came closer. We all snuck out and met at the last street before the woods started. The silence of the night felt heavy on our shoulders. I didn’t know what to expect when we got there. Knowing it was too late to back down, I told everyone not to fear anything and be brave. I thought Verlice’s words, saying he needed brave kids for this challenge. Maybe those words had a secret meaning behind them.

The trees loomed over us, offering us safe passage and shielding us from the beasts that haunt our world during nights like this. An owl hooted in the distance, and a swarm of crows cawed as they flew from the trees. Maybe they warned us it was not too late and we should go back.

“Dammit, we should have hired a TV crew to follow us around. This adventure has all the ingredients to become a series or movie. I mean, it’s perfectly laid out in front of us,” Vince said, checking his phone. “We still have twenty minutes left and should see the clearing quickly.”

“Well, there’s a lot more until the adventure ends. It hasn’t even begun, Vince. I’m curious about what the house looks like,” Cassandra said, imitating a ghost.

We all chuckled and continued walking through the night's deep, dark vastness. Greeted by a dense fog that smelled like petrichor and sweet rose jam, we set eyes on Verlice’s old and diseased house.

The house, old and creaky, stood approximately two feet above the ground, floating as if controlled by an invisible evil force. It creaked from all its joints, nooks, and crannies, the windows dimly illuminated by sick yellow lights. They seemed to grow in intensity as we approached the ancient wooden building.

It swayed to and fro as gently as a feather carried away by gusts of wind. We felt its magnificent force, our hearts getting heavier by the minute. A maelstrom of fear and insecurity took shape inside my mind, twisting and turning endlessly and taking away whatever courage I had left.

“We’re going in to die,” David said dramatically. I didn’t know if he meant it to say out loud. It felt more like a monologue. “Sorry about that. I don’t know what’s gotten into me.”

He glanced at me, his eyes shining with terror and disgust. Yet, we all knew we couldn’t go back. The money Verlice gave us meant we had a binding contract with him. Who knew what this peculiar man's actions would be if we had turned back and walked away?

“Do you guys feel it too?” Cassandra asked, placing the right hand over her heart. “This house senses that we are here. It feeds on our fear. I can feel my heart beating faster than it ever had.”

A black fog enveloped the house, and a loud metallic noise made our bodies tremble. I twisted the key in the lock, and a macabre melody introduced us to our unforgettable adventure.

We hurried inside as if pushed by the dark clouds above our heads. The air outside smelled like a storm would soon arrive, and we would be safer inside the house. Or so the house wanted us to believe.

Inside, a giant chandelier hung from the ceiling and dimly illuminated the old walls. A sicky pale and feverish yellow hue that hurt our eyes while flickering and buzzing as if sending us secret Morse code messages. Wood cracked in the fireplace, and as such, it sent shadows on the walls that danced like black little and deceiving devils. Jasmine, lemon, and chamomille fragrances spread throughout the ancient mansion. It reminded me of the tea my grandmother made me in childhood whenever I had a cold.

“It smells beautiful in here. All these paintings, the mahogany furniture, and the grand chandelier are mesmerizing. This Verlice guy has great taste!” Emma exclaimed, her eyes filled with wonder.

“I gotta admit it myself; this place is as if taken from a book,” said Vince. He looked at the long dark corridor at his left, where a door creaked. “Did you guys hear that?”

We all nodded as the rising tension made our shrinking hearts beat faster.

“Wasn’t there supposed to be a list of rules here?” asked Cassandra.

Silence settled all around us as the door creaked again. We glanced at it and saw that it had opened. The corridor seemed even longer now. With bated breath, we moved towards that door.

“I suppose we’ll find in there,” said David pointing at the half-opened door.

Moving towards the door, passing small windows to our left and even smaller paintings to the wall on our right, I thought about how we ended up in this situation.  Have we chosen to come here, or did Verlice persuade us to and, as such, satisfy his hunger for whatever game he wanted to play here?

Vince opened the door and saw a skeletal figure pointing at us. A demented evil laugh filled every inch of the house. Fear crawled up my spine, and Emma screamed and hugged Cassandra. David froze in place while Eddie’s face went pale all of a sudden, his blood all but draining from his face. Vince had been the only one who didn’t even flinch.

“Screw this old guy and his stupid antics,” Vince said, flipping the lights on. “I ain’t scared of your shit, Verlice. Everyone good?”

One of those skeletons used in biology classes stood before us, his plastic bones all yellowed with age. He held a red crumpled paper in his right hand while his left pointed at us as if telling us to take it.

“I’m ok, even though I almost had a heart attack,” said Emma panting.

“Guess we found his bullshit list of rules. Here, I’ll take it,” I said. I grabbed the red paper, unwrapped it, and read it out loud for all my friends to hear.

Welcome to The Floating House! I very much hope you enjoy your stay with us. Please read the rules of this house. If you follow them accordingly, you will get to the end of your adventure safe and sound. Even better, you’ll each win $1000!

1. If you see the Red Door and hear knocks from the other side, DO NOT OPEN IT!
2. If you meet a bald, big, strange fellow with an orange beard who wants to offer you gold coins, you must be careful. He seems peaceful, but that could not be further from the truth. He will tell you a riddle; if you do not know the answer, he’ll pluck all your fingernails and eat them.
3. If you encounter a Black Door with a golden knob, you must all knock on it. When it opens, you have to go in and stay inside pitch black darkness for just one minute. Once the alarm rings, you’ll find yourselves back where you last were.
4. Room 33 is where you can rest for a few moments. This is the safe room; no harm can come unto you here. The lady in red playing the violin will help you regain your strength and heal any wounds you might have. Listen to her full song!
5. Do not touch the harlequin dolls in the Circus Room. If you do, they will come to life and laugh into your ears until your head explodes.
6. You will arrive in the Room with Clocks. There is a silver key there which you can buy from the Clock Master with coins from Red Beard. If you do not have said coins, you must offer him a personal thing (personal as in a strand of hair, a finger, an eye, your tongue, you get the idea). You will need the key to unlock the exit door.
7. Beware the uninvited guest! There will be a person who will join the group, and you will not even realize it. I don’t even know who they are; this is my house! They’ve been here for 250 years, and I can’t find them. If you see them and manage to trap them, I will ensure your reward is a thing out of this world.
8. If you find a harmonica, you need to play it. The musical notes will lead you to the golden door, which holds secrets that will change your life forever. This never happened to anyone in the history of this house, so it’s almost impossible to happen to you, but I had to tell you this!
9. A woman made of spiders roams the halls of this house. If you see her, do not engage. Walk past her, do not make contact. If she smells your fear, it’s already too late. So do not be afraid if you see her or you will die.
10. The Room with Crystals appears at random. Inside you will find a piece of paper with the last rule of this game.

You must follow the rules only if they apply to the situation. Some of the rules stated in this list might not happen.

Last but not least, I wish you all good luck. I will be waiting for you at the end of this journey. I expect you all to live and stay, let’s say, intact.

Good luck!

Yours truly,

Edgar Verlice

“Fuck this shit,” said Vince. “These rules seem kinda friendly, which is total bullshit. We all know how Verlice is because we saw him. He has that devilish grin. Do you guys remember when he almost took control of our minds? Remember when we looked into his eyes and saw that behind those pupils was a deep black infinite void ready to consume everything in its wake?“

“Yeah, I saw it. But I don’t think we could have done anything about it. I don’t think it was even our decision to be here. He wanted us to play, so he got us to play this stupid game. We must gather our marbles, stay safe, and focus on getting out of here alive. The most important thing is to stay together and not lose sight of one another.” I replied.

Verlice might as well have been the devil himself. He might have been a long-forgotten god who returned triumphantly to Earth to wreak havoc and destroy humanity. I didn’t know what or who the hell he was. All I knew was that he wasn’t from this place, had great powers, knew many secrets, and could twist your mind into doing his bidding. Better to listen to him than to die. Or worse.

By God, we had to get out of this cursed house. The long corridors, the ugly chandeliers, the screechy sounds, and the grotesque paintings of deformed people who looked at us with prying and hateful eyes made my stomach twist into knots.

“Dolls creep me the heck out! Ugh!” Cassandra screamed out of nowhere. “They give me the heebie-geebies!”

“It’s alright, Cass. We won’t touch them if we see them!” David said.

“Hey, guys. You know I love you all, right? We need to be extra careful in this goddamn house because nothing is what it seems. Let’s just play the game by Verlice’s rules. I’ll read them aloud again, and whenever we have doubts, we just pull the paper out and reread them just to make sure, a’ight?” Vince said.

We nodded and listened to each rule again.

“You take it, Henry,” Vince said, handing me the paper.

“Now what?” asked Eddie.

“Damn good question,” I replied.

As far as this game went, we were inside the house, we had the rules, but we had no idea what we needed to do. We inspected the surroundings for anything that might have been useful to our little horror adventure. An adventure that could claim our very lives. Maybe that house needed sustenance and only ate children and their souls and brains, and we would be trapped there forever like ghosts without purpose.

“What the hell are we supposed to do, Verlice?” David cried. “You think this is fun, don’t you? You like scaring children, huh?”

“Woah, easy, Dave. Take it easy, man. It’s gonna be alright. If we follow the rules, we’ll survive this place,” Eddie said.

“Stop it, please,” Emma whispered. “Maybe this is what he wants. Maybe he wants us to stress out and be afraid so we can mess up this thing.”

“Good point,” I concurred. “Let’s calm down, people,” I said. I looked everyone dead in the eye, trying to assure them mentally that it would all be okay, even though I was scared out of my wits.

“The Floating House Tour begins now. Thank you for being here!” a woman’s voice said from the speakers above the large stairs that led to the first floor.

A big letter X came alive right under those speakers.

“X marks the spot, right?” Cassandra said. “Let’s all go there.”

We climbed the stairs and saw the red door. A collective gasp escaped our mouths, and we became statues frozen in time and place. A violent series of knocks and aggressive poundings came from the other side of the door. And words soon followed.

“Let us out, please. He is not who he says he is!” a cacophony of children’s voices cried.

“Wait, don’t say anything,” I whispered. “The first rule didn’t say anything about voice, did it?” I pulled the paper out just to make sure. I nodded to reinforce the last sentence.

“Let’s ignore it and move on. Maybe whatever’s on the other side may kill or drive us insane. Let’s stay focused on the task at hand,” Vince said. “Screw what’s on the other side; I don’t care.”

“Please, we know things. We stood where you stand. We were once children, too, like you. Now, we can’t leave this place. Henry…” they said again, a choir of ghostly voices calling my name.

I felt my legs turn into concrete.

“Henry, don’t let them get into your head, man,” David said, squeezing my shoulder.

“Open the door, Henry. I miss you, son. I miss you so much. It’s cold and dark here. Please, we can be together again.”

A wave of emotions washed over me as I heard my dead father’s voice. He passed away three years ago, and I remembered his smile immediately. Thousands of memories went through my mind like strips of film in an old and dusty cinema theatre. My whole world came crashing down inside and around me, as I wanted this to be true but knew it wasn’t. Verlice and his disgusting house like to feed on pain.

My heart froze with fear.

He gave me the best advice: “Son, always trust your gut. If something’s too good to be true, it’s probably not.”

I knew the house wanted to play tricks on me. It made me hear and remember the person I missed the most. Even though a tidal wave of sadness washed over me, I kept my composure strong and didn’t buy the house's twisted plan for us. I sighed and swallowed the bitter sorrow I felt at that moment.

The only sure thing was that my dad had been gone for a few years, buried six feet under, and probably only bones now. I wiped the tears from my face and didn’t say a word. I passed the door and motioned everyone to follow me. When I looked back, the door had vanished.

“Sorry, guys. I need a minute or two. This felt so real, goddamn Verlice… He likes to feed on our sadness and fear, huh?” I sighed. “We need to get out of here fast.”

I sat on the floor and thought about the whole situation for a moment. Why us? I mean, why did he target us? Had he felt a strong connection between all of us? Doesn’t he like true friendship? Did he want us to toward against each other?

I kept staring down the long corridor of the first floor. It seemed to be infinite, stretching into nothingness. The silence that surrounded us was gravelike. It was as if tiny, evil monsters lurked in the shadows or behind furniture, waiting to see what plan we had devised or if we’d go completely and utterly insane.

On the left side of the door, a lightbulb came to life. Its dim pale bluish hue illuminated an ordinary door. But that wasn’t all.  On the floor, right in front of the door, was a small box with a harlequin head drawn on it. A small handle on one side began slowly rotating, and a creepy tune began playing.
