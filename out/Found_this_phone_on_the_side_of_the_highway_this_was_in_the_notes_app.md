Please whoever is reading this I am begging you to find me. I don’t care how I don’t care about anything else just get me out of this room. My name is Claire Marie Price, my birthday is 07/19/2000. My parents are Jonathan and Rosetta Price, if someone can contact them please tell them I love them and call the police. My phone can’t get through to an emergency operator, I just get a busy tone. I’ve tried so many times. I just want to go home, please God, let me go home.

Hello again whoever is reading this. No one has found me yet. I don’t know if these messages are even going anywhere. If this is gonna be it for me I might as well tell you what’s going on to the best of my ability. I don’t know much. I have a portable battery with me for my phone, whoever stuck me in here didn’t think to take my purse. I wish I had something more helpful, but this will do. 

Three days ago, I woke up in what I have surmised is a concrete box. It’s about five feet tall and six feet wide. I can’t stand up all the way, just crouch, but I can sort of lay down. It’s really cold. The floor is dirt, but there’s a layer of concrete underneath. I scraped the shit out of my knuckles trying to dig out. I really hope it doesn’t get infected. That’d be a pretty bad way to go out. 

My left leg is shackled to the floor, the chains are metal, pretty typical stuff from a hardware store. The end of it is welded to a metal pole encased in the concrete under the dirt. The chain isn’t very long, not that I have anywhere to go. I dug a pit in the corner as a bathroom…I haven’t had anything to eat or drink in a while so luckily that hasn’t really been an issue. I’m so thirsty I think I could die. My tongue has started to ache. I can’t even think about food, I just need water.

 I don’t want to die here. 

…

Someone put water in the box. I fell asleep for a few hours, it’s the first time I’ve slept all week. I was crying and I just drifted off, I was so exhausted I couldn’t stay awake. When I woke up, there was a bottle of water. Just a regular zephyrhills water bottle. I checked every wall and the ceiling too. There’s no door, no holes, no way to get in or out. I want out so badly but right now I just have to count my blessings and drink. My tongue started to swell up. I think I almost died. 

…


It’s been a week now. 

This phone still has a calendar. I can count the hours. It’s all I can do to keep from going crazy. Sometimes I just cry. I have to let it out, accept that I’m going to die somewhere in a box. I wonder if my mom is sad. I wonder if anyone is looking for me. Will they ever find me? I don’t want to be one of those people who shows up on a cold case documentary, where they never find the body and the family keeps hoping. That’s too cruel. I hope they at least find my bones, give my family something to bury. I have to stop thinking like this but I think I’ve given in to despair. I have to accept that this is probably the end. I’m scared. 

… 

The box is bigger. I fell asleep again. I’m so tired all the time now. I’m so thin. It’s been a month. Someone made the box bigger. I don’t know how. It’s so dark. I can’t see. I can hear someone breathing. I’m not alone. 

…

He’s here. Someone is in the left corner on the other side of the box. I hear his stomach growling. I’m so hungry. How hungry is he? 

…

He was very hungry. 
The world is going dark. 
The flashlight is scaring him back into the corner but the battery will die soon. 
He’s looking at me again. 
This is the end.
I love you mommy. I love you. I love you. I lo
