Even as my heart raced, my mind wandered.

I’d driven these roads before all of this happened.  We were only a few miles out of town, on what used to be a beautiful stretch of mountains that were perfect for hiking and camping.  The first time I’d been out here it had looked just like this; early fall, with the aspens high up on the slopes shimmering yellow, the creeks flowing crystal clear.

I’d moved up here with her, so she could get her Ph.D, and it was one of our first hikes.  There were so many good memories, all pushed away by one terrible one.

Memories are a strange thing.  You never know how accurate they are.  When the howls rang out in the night, did I really know they were coming for us?  Or did I remember it that way because that’s what happened?

Was it only seconds later that the windows smashed inwards and bare footsteps thudded violently on the floorboards and up the stairs?  Or had we lain there paralyzed with fear for longer than we thought?

In the end, I suppose none of those details mattered.  I was pushing the screen out of the window when they broke down the door.  Natalia grabbed the hunting rifle next to the bed, and managed to get a shot off as they came through the door, the flash illuminating the dark room and painting a wet spot on the white door.

One of them got to her, rushing forward with his gaping mouth, clubbing her temple with the bottom of his closed fist and sending her body to the floor, limp.  The other had come through the door right after, and tackled me.  I *know* the howlers were in the room less than five seconds, because I couldn’t get a shot off before I was thrown out of the window, the woman on top of me wide eyed and unflinching as we fell onto the first floor roof.  The last I saw of Natalia, that thing had grabbed her by the ankles and was dragging her back toward the door.

The rest was a blur.  The deafening blast as I put the revolver’s barrel up to the side of her head and pulled the trigger.  Rolling her body off of me as the thin, white, filament-like worms already began to span the gunshot wound, stemming the flow of blood.  Getting into the car, turning the key with shaking hands, as she clumsily tried to crawl toward me on hands and knees.  They usually wouldn’t die, but if you hit them in the head it took a while for their motor skills to come back.

We got to my car, sitting in the middle of the road with no gas.  Luke popped the hood to get the battery as I gathered my pack full of food and anything else useful from inside.  All of that was done in a minute or two, and we continued through the forest, past the cabin I’d slept in for the three weeks after Natalia was taken.

For a moment I wondered if this was a life worth living, if it would be better to put a bullet through my head while it would still be effective.  Realistically I was just starving in the woods, waiting for winter, knowing the woman I loved more than anything in the world was now full of worms and howled at night.  Looking at Luke, I figured I would at least do this for him, for his family.  I could still help them.

“Do you really think those things came from space, on some rock?  Or do you think they came from a lab in China?”  Luke asked.

I laughed.

“I don’t know that it really matters, now,”  I said.  “But my wife had a bunch of biologist friends at MSU.  They were pretty convinced it was from space.  They said there’s no way people could make an organism like that.”

He looked at the ring on my finger.

“Feel free to ignore this question, I know it’s not polite.  What happened to your wife?”

“No, it’s fine.  They grabbed her, about uh, three weeks ago.  Twenty four days ago.  If you hit the main road and go a half mile towards town, I could show you the house we were staying in.”

“I’m sorry.  I have nightmares every night that they take Sherry and Matt.”

We’d discussed it, and Sherry was staying with Matt, in a relatively safe part of the woods.  They were close enough to that outpost to walk.  I figured I’d give Luke the details, since any information about the howlers might help down the line.

“I heard them outside, howling.  They broke through a window and came straight for us.  I swear they knew where we were.  Whole thing took ten seconds, I think.  I saw one dragging her away.  Natalia.  That’s her name.”

“Jesus.  I’m so sorry.”

“Let’s just keep focused on today.  I came in through the basement, the door down there should still be unlocked.”

I went over everything about the house; where the food was, how much there was.  How if you went upstairs there was a bedroom on the left, and in there was a closet with a door to the master bathroom.  I told him about the rags packed into every crack, to keep light out.

“Hopefully those rags keep some sound out, too.”  He said.

Luke knew the area better than I did, and found the actual road to the driveway, so that we wouldn’t have to scramble up the hill like I had.  Not two hundred yards from the house, there was a car with the windows broken in and blood on the seat.  Had I seen that, I never would have gone in.

Passing the driveway, Luke began to back up toward the house.  It was downhill, so he killed the engine to make less noise, putting it in neutral and cranking the wheel hard.  We didn’t want to wake the howlers up, but we didn’t want the car to be any farther away than it had to if we did.

It was shocking how peaceful the cabin looked, with a quiet forest all around and the creek running beneath.  Light blue clapboard siding, with the window and door frames white.  No cars on the road, only birds singing.  I saw a Stellar’s jay happily squawking on a branch across the lawn.

My hands shook as I opened the basement door, still unlocked.  Carefully, we stepped over the broken glass there, going into the basement.  Each stair up to the main floor was painful, waiting to see which ones creaked under my foot.  One made a louder squeak than the others.  Luke and I froze, my pistol ready in my hands, a shotgun in his.

I imagined the door upstairs being thrown open, the bare feet barreling down the hallway toward us.  But nothing happened.

There was more light in the kitchen, with windows on two sides showing cloudy mountaintops and dark green forest.  Most of the food was still piled in the middle of the floor, where I had left it.  We loaded up pillow cases, grabbing the biggest items first, like bags of rice.  Then we moved on to cans and jars, things that took time to move quietly.  Each tiny clink of metal or glass was painful, but we would need everything we could get.  Winters were long up here.

Almost everything was packed up, and we made our first trip out the same way we had come.  Luke and I exchanged a determined look as we set the first haul into the bed of the truck carefully.  We were halfway done.

Painstakingly, we went back over the glass, then back up the stairs, avoiding the creaky one.  I did one last check of the pantry, making sure we hadn’t missed anything.

There was a 20 pound bag of rice tucked onto a high shelf.  I didn’t know how I could have missed it, but a smile came across my face, and Luke nodded with appreciation.  That was the single best score in the whole pantry, and I began to carefully shift it down.

As it came out, I noticed something on the bag.  The text was white, but there was something else.  A white string.

From the next cupboard, a loud, rattling noise made me jump.  It was the worst sound I’d ever heard, like a jar full of cutlery was being dumped onto glass plates.  With the bag of rice now in my hands, I could see the string around it going into the adjacent cupboard.  It was a sound trap.

A door slammed open upstairs.  A bathroom door.  Urgent howls pierced our ears, deafening, from inside the house, high pitched and unearthly.

Luke and I grabbed the food and ran.

We took the flight to the basement three or four stairs at a time, sprinting across the broken glass with hands full, emerging into daylight.  We threw the bags into the bed of the truck, leaping into the doors we had left open.

Before Luke could turn the key, I heard the faint ring of broken glass as bare feet darted across it.  Then there was a howl, close.  It sounded pained, perhaps from the sun.

The moment the engine turned, Luke had it in drive with the tires kicking up dirt.  But not soon enough.

A fist punched through his window, then the hand blindly grabbed at his shirt, unconcerned by the glass shredding the skin on the inside of the elbow.  An older woman’s face appeared, with wide open eyes and a gaping mouth, tongue limp across the bottom teeth.  Her pupils were enormous, I couldn’t even tell what color her eyes would have been.  She began to pull at the wheel when I shot her in the face.

I had to pick my shot, to not hit Luke.  As he pried her fingers from the wheel and slammed the brakes, we were still going off the road.  The truck tilted to the left as we began to go down the hill, but Luke managed to save it somehow.  Thank God that man could drive.

When my window broke, I had to switch the pistol to my left hand.  An older man’s bleeding fingers clawed at my right shoulder with unbelievable strength.  Under his skin, the white worms were already stitching the cuts from the broken glass together, pulling each side of the slashed skin closed.  I missed him with my first shot, shattering the glass completely now, but landed a sloppy second shot on his chest, knocking him back from the car.

I pulled away from the window, practically leaning back into Luke’s lap as a third howler ran up to the truck, which Luke was just now getting back on the road.  It leapt into my window, with hands outstretched.  I lined up my shot, trying to hit her in the head.

The head with light brown hair, down to her shoulders.  The head with gentle freckles across her cheeks.  The head with a wide open mouth howling at me, through lips I had kissed so many times.

The second I had her in the sights was the second I recognized her, and I hesitated.  I think I would have pulled the trigger if I’d had another moment, but I’ll never know.  Her whole upper body pushed through the window, one hand pushed the gun down, and the other grabbed my collar.  I tried to pry her hand free of the pistol, but couldn’t, even with both of mine.

With her knees on the broken glass at the base of the window, Natalia leaned back and pulled me from the truck, both of us hitting the ground and rolling.  The older man was already at the tailgate as Luke hit the brakes once again.

“Go!  Just go!”  I yelled.

To his credit, he did.  Dirt flung up from the tires, and he swerved sharply, the side of the truck hitting the old man and pushing him tumbling down the hill.

I watched Luke’s escape with more interest than my own.  When a fist smashed my head into the ground, I lost any ability to care.  The second hit was a blur.



My eyes opened to a splitting headache, then a horrible stench of death.  Something was sticking up out of the bathtub; a deer hoof.

It was dark in the room, but faint light came in under the door.  The rags lay in disarray on the tile floor next to me.  I guess whatever they were going to do, they were doing it in a hurry.

I was on my back, the old man over me.  His eyes were wide, his mouth open.  Trails of thick drool dripped into his coarse beard, and I thought I could make out something squirming among the white hairs.

With one hand, he pressed on my cheeks, thumb on one side, fingers on the other.  He was trying to open my mouth.

I resisted, thrashing from side to side, but his grip was iron.  The metallic taste of blood began to fill my mouth as my cheeks were pressed into my teeth with excruciating pressure, and it felt as if my teeth themselves might give way.

My mouth opened, against my will, held in place by a middle finger and thumb that would have touched if my lacerated cheeks weren’t between them.  The man began to cough, and thick trails of drool stretched down, toward my mouth.  I screamed, consumed with fear.

In the dim light, a hand touched his shoulder gently.  His head turned, then lifted away from mine.

He straightened up, leaving his hand in place.  Where his face had been, another leaned in from the side.  Drool still dripped from the gaping mouth, viscous and vaguely undulating.

I didn’t want this, but at least it was her.

They’d set the sound trap for me.  The old man stopped to let her infect me.  They clearly had some intelligence, some social interaction.  Maybe, in some way, I could still be with her.  I told myself that as the first trail of saliva hit my lips, and I felt something begin to slither down [my throat](https://www.reddit.com/r/patrickmullensauthor/comments/1kern3o/patrick_mullens_written_work/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
