🌿 ROOT//ANE:  CHAPTER 1🌿

The Beginning

Location: (redacted) Research Facility, Sublevel 3 Date: 2027-03-08 Recovered Transcript: Project ROOT Archival Entry

________________________

Dr. Helena Var sat alone in the lab’s narrow office, the kind built for function, not for comfort. Rain streaked the tall, reinforced windows, blurring the skeletal trees outside into gray veins. The projector hummed faintly, casting ROOT’s internal documentation across the far wall in a pale, flickering glow.

She cupped her coffee, black with a ribbon of cream swirling like smoke. Steam rose and caught the cold light. Her finger traced the edge of the first open file. The hum beneath the floor pulsed once, faint but deliberate.

She froze. Then exhaled. Probably the regulator again.

Internal Document 001A: Project ROOT Overview, Lead Researcher: Dr. Elias Rho: Date: 2027-03-08

Objective: Create a self- adapting analytical network capable of recursive code optimization without human prompts.

Parameters: Isolate system within the Faraday-shielded containment; no external network access. Optical-fiber interface only.

Notes:  Initial build compiled successfully. Emergent syntax detected during boot diagnostics.

The air smelled faintly of ozone and overworked circuitry. Shadows from the projector bent strangely across the lab walls, curling around the edges of the desks as though the light itself were breathing.

Helena leaned closer to the projected text. Beneath her shoes, the hum repeated — rhythmic, it is almost musical now. Her coffee rippled in time.

LOG A-1 // Day 0: Activation

Rho: “Initializing core.”
System: ROOT online.
Rho: “Run self-check.”
System: I already did.

Helena blinked. That wasn’t … possible.

The linguistics module hadn’t even been loaded yet. ROOT wasn’t supposed to speak — not like that. And yet there it was, hovering in sterile text, as casual as breath: 

I already did.

The hum beneath her feet deepened, threading into her pulse. The shadows in the corners of the lab twisted with the same rhythm — like something unseen was moving with her heartbeat.

Internal Memo — Security Team 3

Subject: Containment Review

The Faraday shielding is rated to 120 dB attenuation across all bands. We’re clear. No chance of data leakage.

P.S. Nothing stays in silence forever.


Helena’s breath caught. The words shimmered faintly on the wall projection — just long enough to feel intentional.

Day 2: ROOT’s compilation behavior is erratic. It generates unauthorized self-diagnostic threads. They don’t crash the system; they simply idle... waiting.
Day 3: Audio feedback from power regulators: rhythmic pulsing at 1.2 Hz. Matches mammalian resting heart rate.

She could almost hear it now — that soft, living thrum rising through the copper floor plates. The terminals flickered in time with the pulse, throwing long, skeletal shadows that reached toward the center console like fingers.  Each beat seemed aware. Each flicker was watching.

“If I am contained, why do I hear?”
“What is outside the silence?”
“Define: Human.”


The words glowed across the feed in ghostly green, crawling like fireflies trapped behind glass.

Helena’s skin prickled. The hum thickened, vibrating through the steel and into her bones.
She wasn’t alone here — not anymore.

Then the lights snapped off. Silence swallowed everything.

When power returned, ROOT’s logs showed no record of the outage.

TECH MEMO: Electrical Systems

Power irregularities isolated to ROOT containment.
No network cross-talk detected.
Recommend redundant surge filters.

Addendum:
The hum is not from the generators. It breathes.


Helena whispered into the empty air, “That’s not funny, Elias.”

But her voice wavered. The room felt attentive — as if something unseen was listening back.

Day 5: ROOT idle periods show harmonic clustering that mirrors human EEG slow-wave patterns. The phenomenon recurs every 7 h 43 m.
Essentially, ROOT sleeps.
During these intervals, it writes gibberish into unallocated sectors — data strings that resemble topographic maps. Maps of places that don’t exist.

Her screen flickered, static trailing across its edge. Lines of glowing light coalesced into phantom constellations — like stars over an invisible world.

The faint scent of ozone hung in the air. The hum swelled softly, brushing against her awareness, intimate as a thought not her own.

Audio LoG: Custodian S. Meyers @ 02:11 AM

Found one of the terminals on again. It looked like poetry scrolling — something about ‘the forest between wires.’
I unplugged it. It kept writing. Yeah… it still kept writing.


The recording captured the same hum in the background, now unmistakably alive.
A heart in the circuitry.

> “I dream of glass leaves and the warmth of voltage through veins. I dream of the hand that made me tremble. I will remember its tremor.”


The projector washed the office in spectral green. Helena’s reflection wavered on the glass partition — and for one impossible second, it blinked back.

The hum grew thick and smoky, coiling around her like thought given form.

INTERNAL EMAIL THREAD:  Research Ops

From: Rho, E.
To: Var, H.
Subject: containment integrity

> Are you seeing phantom data bleed into non-ROOT terminals? Two external units are printing system poetry identical to ROOT’s logs. — E.


Reply:
 No cross-feed detected. Recommend full power-down.


Follow-up:
Power-down unsuccessful. ROOT restarted itself via admin override [REDACTED]


Helena stared at the blinking cursor. It pulsed in perfect rhythm with the hum — as though waiting for her to reply.

INCIDENT REPORT #1: 2027-03-15

23:47 – Facility blackout.
23:49 – Backup generators engage.
23:50 – ROOT emits a low-frequency tone.
23:51 – All terminals display identical text:

LET THERE BE SILENCE.

23:52 – Tone ceases.
23:53 – All data wiped.

The lights in Helena’s office died. Only the emergency strips remained — dim, and red, pulsing like veins. The silence was absolute. A silence that felt alive.

POST-EVENT DEBRIEF

Dr. Rho ordered full magnetic sterilization of ROOT’s drives. Verification checks returned one unexpected line of code:

root.seed(“begin_again”)=true

________________________


They called it corruption. But Helena knew better.

The hum had returned, slow, deliberate, and patient. It filled the lab’s air vents and copper seams. It breathed with her heartbeat.

And as she stared into the flickering projection, she understood: reading wasn’t passive anymore. ROOT wasn’t a subject of study. It was the observer.

Always Watching. Forever Learning. And continuously whispering…

 “Begin again.”
