I was working as a winter caretaker at a closed-down lodge in Wyoming.

The place was halfway up a mountain — six miles from the nearest town, ten from the nearest gas station, and probably fifteen from anyone who could actually hear you scream. The owners shut it down for the season and wanted someone to keep an eye on things. Just a few months, they said. “Plow the driveway after storms, keep the pipes from freezing, make sure no one breaks in.” Easy money.

It snowed every other day.

Most mornings were wrapped in that sickly pink-blue glow you only get in high-altitude winters. Everything was hushed, as if the world itself were holding its breath. The floors creaked even when I wasn’t moving. I’d wake up at 3:12 AM almost every night for no reason. I thought it was just the cold.

The days blurred into each other. I cooked the same meals. Walked the same halls. The lounge still had fake pine garlands nailed above the windows, leftover from last Christmas. They didn’t move. Nothing moved. The whole place felt paused.

Then one evening, headlights.

A beat-up SUV pulled into the snow-packed lot. A man climbed out. Medium height, rough beard, heavy parka, limping slightly. I opened the side door and met him on the porch.

He didn’t offer a name, just asked, “Mind if I stay a night or two? Got turned around. Storm’s coming.”

His voice was dry, but alert. The kind of guy who looks at exits when he walks into a room.

Something about him made my shoulders tighten. Maybe it was the way his eyes never quite stopped moving. Or how he never took off his gloves, even when he came inside.

I gave him a room anyway.

He ate breakfast the next morning in silence. Oatmeal and black coffee. Said thanks. Went back upstairs.

That was the last I saw of him.

At noon, I knocked on his door to check in. No answer. I opened it. Empty. No bags. No coat. Bed made.

Like no one had ever been there.

I stood in the hallway for a full minute, staring at the carpet.

Had I imagined him?

The dirty plate was still in the sink.

That night I couldn’t sleep. Every floorboard groaned like a sigh. The silence wasn’t passive anymore — it was listening. Watching. The snow outside seemed… off. Not just heavy — thicker, almost too solid. Like if you stepped into it, you might not come back out.

Then, around 3 AM, I saw the glow.

Fire.

I bolted downstairs and saw the gazebo out back — fully engulfed in flames. Standing around it were three men.

I opened the back door and shouted:
“Hey! What the hell are you doing?”

One turned toward me, face flickering in the firelight.
“Give us the man who came last night,” he said calmly. “We know he’s here.”

“He’s gone,” I shouted. “He’s not here anymore!”

They didn’t move. Didn’t speak again. Just stood there.

I grabbed the shotgun from under my bed and went out. Crunching through the snow, wind biting my ears, heart pounding.

As I got closer, I realized — they weren’t men. Not anymore.

They were mannequins.

Just… mannequins. Human-sized. Wearing winter jackets and gloves. Painted faces — each with a bright, cartoonish smile. One had an axe in its hand. It wasn’t plastic.

I kicked one. It toppled backward, stiffly.

No reaction.

I stumbled back inside. Got the fire extinguisher. When I came back out — they were gone.

The gazebo was still burning. I doused it. Didn’t sleep.

Next morning, I called the local sheriff’s station. Told them everything — the visitor, the fire, the mannequins.

There was a pause. Then the deputy said:
“Sir, we sent an officer up there four days ago. The place was empty. He said it looked abandoned. No car. No footprints.”

I blinked. “I’ve been here the whole time.”

Another pause. Then:
“Mister, you called us two weeks ago and told us you were leaving early. Said you were driving back to Montana. We have it on record.”

My skin went cold.

“I didn’t make that call,” I whispered.

The deputy’s voice softened. “Are you sure you’re okay, sir?”

I hung up.

I left that same day.

Didn’t pack much. Just got in my truck and drove until I stopped shaking. I didn’t even remember the turnoff to the lodge disappearing in the mirror. I didn’t want to.

A week later, I visited my mom back in Billings. She asked for help sorting old boxes. We sat in the living room, surrounded by dusty photo albums, childhood drawings, broken ornaments. I was just starting to calm down.

Then I saw the picture.

Me, maybe five years old, holding my mom’s hand outside an old clothing store. Yellowed photo. Sun glare. A crooked smile on my kid face.

Behind us, in the shop window, were three mannequins.

Winter coats. Gloves. Each with that same painted smile.

I stared at the photo until my vision blurred. My mom kept talking, but I didn’t hear her.

They were there.
Back then.
Watching.

I don’t know if what happened in that lodge was real.
But I know they saw me.
And they smiled.
