Guys i think I’m in danger this is going to be bad grammar and short I don’t have much time so it started about a week ago I was driving home I turned a corner into my town and I’m going slow about 3 mph I’m only just learning how to drive it’s also 10pm and this is a small town I look over at the street light and standing 


under it is a man in a white hoodie just standing there nothing else’s jeans and a white hoodie hood on I think to my self how weird is this it’s so late why is he out here I turn a few more corners pondering the man until I get home I 


make my self some instant noodles and I turn on the tv greys anatomy I growl I hate this show so I look out the wonder in the distance i see the same man or at least I think it is he’s standing Under another street light same way but this time he’s holding a knife I become a bit 


scared and finish my noodles I decide to go to bed and maybe they are pranking me I get in bed and I just think and think about that man and then I fall asleep. I jolted upright 7 am my alarm I wake up and get dressed for school eat breakfast as I’m walking out of the door I look over at the end of the street and he’s standing there the white hoodie man not moving no knife 


this time I’m scared I pass it off as a joke a really sick joke I get in my car and drive to school as I’m turning into school parking lot I see him again standing next to the entrance I decide fine I’ll walk past him I walk past him and I feel breath on my neck and a hand and some muttering I couldn’t make it out though I’m petrified then I hear a voice Hey bro my best friend I sigh in relief I turn to look at him and the white hoodie man is gone how weird I’ll forget 


about it I have a good day at school I tell my friend about this and he says what white hoodie man there wasn’t one bro you good? Weird I swear he was there fast forward 5 days no sighting of him I forgot about him until one night I go to unlock my door and I turn around to grab the package at my door and he’s there standing and watching I bolt inside and lock all doors I’m scared for my life at the moment I don’t eat just go to bed and try to forget I fall 


asleep and then  I jolt up 2:15Am how weird I go to turn over and right when I lay my head down then I hear footsteps. Not my parents they’re gone for two week in Costa Rica I freak out I hide under my covers I hear my door turn I look really quick it’s him he’s holding a pair of small scissors I hide back under the covers that was 10 minutes ago I’m still under here and I don’t 


know what to do I can hear him muttering and I have to go now I can’t make a noise or he might do something I’m worried this might be my last entry. That was the last few entries of my brother. He’s been missing for 1 year now and I saw the white hoodie man yesterday I don’t know what to do
