Welcome to grandpa's farm, You can enjoy playing with the animals or help grandpa with chores. You can play around and have fun during day time but you must follow his rules after the sun sets.

1. Lock all doors and windows. Don't forget to close and barricade the main door, it must be locked shut or IT might get in. Don't forget to set up bear traps outside and in the house.

2. Go to sleep before 8 or 9 pm. make sure to lock and barricade your door, no matter what you do or hear do not go out until sunrise. This rule is for kids only, If you are 13 years old or above, You must follow the next rules.

3. Don't open any doors or let anyone in. If you hear someone asking for help DO NOT LET THEM IN, They are either getting attacked by IT or it's using them as bait. IT can mimic the voice of IT's victims, It can also change the form, It can take a form of a human or your dog. Forget about your dog, forget about the animals, If they're unlucky to be chosen as food then you can always replace them.

4. Get ready for defense. If it somehow breaks in prepare to fight, You can use the pitchfork and spade for defense only, grandpa will be using the shotgun. What we're dealing with is no ordinary creature, no matter what you do, do not attack it first, It's best to wait for it to attack or choose its prey. If it finally chose who to eat, prepare to fight, It won't fight anyone else but its prey so others can attack it without it fighting back, If you're chosen then you must be prepared to defend yourself. If we hurt it enough it will run away, We can only scare it away for a while but we can't kill it, It will always come back. If we're lucky enough that it didn't choose anyone, Barricade the doors again, It might change its mind.

5. Stay awake. You must stay awake until sunrise, Drinking energy juice or coffee can help. Don't be relieved that it's away, Even if we scared it away it might come back for revenge.

6. Clean up. clean all the mess that was made by IT, Throw all dead bodies away and leave no evidence of IT attacking anyone, The children must not see them, It's better if they don't know about IT until they're old enough.

7. Don't ask about IT. Don't tell anyone about IT, Don't go to the woods and search for IT, And most importantly, Don't ask grandpa about it. when you're old enough grandpa will tell you about it, He’ll only tell you what IT does and what to do, and after that, he won't answer any questions about IT and he will be upset if you ask about IT. They say It lives near the woods but comes hunting for food in farms and houses, they also say IT doesn't belong to this world and IT was somehow related to grandpa, They also say grandpa feeds IT But it's all just rumors from people who know about IT.

That's all the rules you must follow at grandpa’s farm, Make sure to follow them if you want to stay alive. Good luck.
