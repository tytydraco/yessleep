I can't see a truth or a lie. It is just the darkness around me that devour me to a whole. But as I lay here, slowly absorbing the anesthesia, mouth getting drier by the moment, parts of the numbness creePing over my body,I can't help but think Was it a lie? But... Why?

Two years ago when I lost My sight in an accident, it felt like I was thrown into a void where there was no up, no down and no side to escape. The medication did not seem to work, I constantly got panic attacks due to my fear of darkness and constantly got hit by some walls and poles. The saddest part was that my parents went radio silent after that. No talking, only leading me somewhere if they are near. I could hear my mom wimpering and my dad whispering downstairs at night "God, please spare her, she did nothing wrong" My mom cried. She have always been a religious person. But one night everything stopped. The prayers, The whispers, every thing.. The only thing left was the eerie silence always behind me, hugging me in its cold embrace. But as the number of medications grew, my sleep was also decreased. I was always hazy but could not sleep.

Now, the anesthesia is getting to my consciousness. I have to settle my thoughts and movements quickly. Anyway, I, after that moment stopped having my medication. My mom was mad at me for that, but what I noticed was that after a long time I heard my mom's voice. It was ... wierd . For some reason her voice was hollow, but still it was her. Right?

From that moment onwards I slowly, secretly started to flush my medications. I knew it was not good to do that, but I noticed that I was infact having a nice sleep. for several nights after I stopped taking the medicines and I do value my rest so I carried on with my secret. To be honest I was feeling much better the while I was on my medications. I think my mom noticed that and questioned me but everytime she spoke, i could not shake off the feeling of being oblivious of something.

Now the doctor is in the room, probably preparing for the surgery, I guess. I don't think I have much time but I will try to stay awake. "Now, Jane, I'm going to start the procedure so now, try counting 1-10 backwards." Said the doctor as my eyes grew heavy "10" I started counting. "9" I felt someone strapping me to the bed. "8" I felt sometHing getting injected to my hand. "7" I hear someone enter the room. "6" I hear some murmurring. "5" I feel like many eyes are on me. "4" The scapel glides. through my skin. "3" I finally close my eyeS.

2 weeks ago I got my eyesight back. Technically yes. But still my vision was blurry. I haven't told my parents yet. I don't know why, but I did not feel like it. It feels... not right?

Now I'm in the dining hall my dad sitted directly in front of me. My mom is in the kitchen washing dishes. I suddenly felt a strong piercing pain in my head. It was painful to the point that I crawled out of the chair while dragging myself on the floor. I heard my mom rushing towards me and through my blurred vision I saw my dad slowly, unbothered walking to me. And... I blanked out.
  When I opened my eyes, my vision was back. I saw that I was in some sort of operation theatre. And in front of me was... My mom. But somthing was wierd with her. Her skin... It seemed like it was sewed onto her like... Like a dress. When she turned to me there was something unnaturaL about her face. It felt like it was stretched to be fitted onto her. She spoke in a known but uncanny voice " hello darling, did not think that you would recover so fast. Actually... "Bad for you now you have to go away soon. But why? Why are you doing this to me? To us?" I asked with the little energy that is left in me. Oh that is the only way we can fit into this world. Your world." She said as I looked confused. "I thought you won't be a pickle for us, but here you are laying here helpless without your parents to plead for you" she said getting closer, Inches apart from mine. I could see it clearly, there was something that looked like rotten flesh underneath her unhealed skin. Her eyes were a bit out than it used to be. She looks at me with the most sinister grin I've ever seen. That is the moment I realised the cries were not prayers but a plead for life. My life. 

Now, I wished that I never knew the truth. Never knew the difference between them. Never really questioned them as I lay here probably taking my last breath or maybe first of some other creatures laying inside me.
