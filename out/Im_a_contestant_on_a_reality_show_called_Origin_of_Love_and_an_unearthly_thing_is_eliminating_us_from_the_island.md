I’m a fool who hungered for fame and fortune, and that kind of belly-rumbling desperation blinds a person to red flags. A £500,000 prize. Who would refuse that?

I would ask for somebody to send help, but I don’t even know this island’s name. That was one of the conditions for applicants. No questions. They confiscated our technology on Day 1, but I concealed my phone in my top. And I hope, by revealing the truth of this insidious island, I’ll at least be able to stop them from claiming more lives. The company is called DozMinus Entertainment. Why can I no longer find any trace of them online?

“Welcome to *Origin of Love*!” The producer, Mr Wilson, ecstatically said. “When you board this boat, you’ll be taken to a private island and filmed for three months on your journey towards finding love. Real love. Biological bonds. Nothing fabricated. We know who’s truly suited to one another. The island knows.”

There were eight contestants, and we were each given a briefing before meeting one another:

**Matthew (27):** A business consultant from Birmingham. Loves climbing. Weak-willed.

**Becky (28):** A statistician from Bolton. Spends her free time playing guitar. Breaks hearts.

**Callum (25):** A personal trainer from London. Raves every weekend. Fathered ten children with seven women.

**Kofi (31):** A dentist from London. Likes watching horror films. Parents were arms dealers.

**Billie-Jo (20):** A social media influencer from Cornwall. Tennis enthusiast. Fibs.

**Han (35):** A civil engineer from Cambridge. Parties in Ibiza. Skips quality checks at work, endangering lives.

**Zack (24):** A real-estate agent from Cardiff. Takes pride in finding homes for people. Takes more than a fair share of their money too.

**Gracie (22):** A computer science student from Bristol. Dreams of making video games. Kleptomaniac.

I’m Becky, by the way. I didn’t mention anything about breaking hearts in my interview, and I felt it safe to assume that none of the others revealed their secrets either. I eyed the cameras, which were clumsily hidden in bushes and between fence panels. *All of this* *is for entertainment*, I reminded myself. It wasn’t about romance, as the producers had purported. I was right, but I didn’t know what it was they *did* want.

“You can’t truly fall in love until you know somebody’s secrets,” Mr Wilson explained, leading us into the villa. “With your cards on the table, the experiment begins. Love can freely blossom.”

Over the following weeks, Mr Wilson’s prophecy was quickly proven correct. ‘Biological bonds’ were indeed forged. Four couples formed. All eight of us were perfectly matched. There was something sinisterly orchestrated about it, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. I hated feeling like a guinea pig, but I couldn’t help gravitating towards Matthew. Fuck the half-a-million pounds. I was— *am* in love.

“I just find you irresistible,” Matthew said. “Then again, I *am* weak-willed.”

Last night, however, this run-of-the-mill reality show transformed into a horror that I’m struggling to put into words. But I’ll try my best to condense events and submit this post before they discover me.

“Elimination time!” Mr Wilson announced. “Only one couple can win the grand prize, and it’s time to thin out the herd.”

“Has there been a public vote?” Han nervously asked.

“No,” The producer answered, chuckling and directly eyeballing one of the cameras. “The *island* will test which of our couples has the weakest connection. Follow me, contestants!”

Without any instructions, we were led from the villa into a nearby forest. The setting sun wasobscured by the canopy of leaves above us. But as Mr Wilson guided us deeper into the forest, he began to light torches on either side of the dirt path. Matthew held my hand and beamed at me.

“We’ve got this one in the bag,” He said.

“I don’t know,” I whispered, shuddering. “I’ve got this horrible feeling in my stomach.”

“Do you think it was the paella we had for dinner, babe?” Billie-Jo asked.

“No, I… Never mind,” I replied.

“Silence!” Mr Wilson bellowed.

His voice erupted so suddenly that all eight of us instantly ceased chattering. We found ourselves in a forest clearing encircled by torches and cameras on tripods. Our enigmatic host had adopted an unsettling energy, finally revealing what burgeoned beneath the surface of his disingenuous smile.

“Private viewers,” He announced to one of the cameras. “You have suffered weeks of preamble. But now, the time is upon us. Which of these couples is truly meant to be? It is a primal decision left to nature. Left to *him*. The island shall show the way.”

“The island shall show the way,” Voices chanted in unison from the darkness of the forest.

A terrifying heaviness filled my insides as I watched Mr Wilson disappear beyond the tree-line with a malevolent grin on his face. Frightened beyond words, I squeezed Matthew’s hand until I felt it might break. When I looked at him, all colour had leaked from his face. The same could be said of everycontestant, but the true terror came when the ground beneath our feet began to quake.

Choral singing erupted from all sides of our blackened surroundings. And from the dirt in the clearing, arms began to emerge. Dozens of disembodied arms, bending into painful configurations. I felt frozen fingers working up my calf, numbing my flesh. I looked down in horror at the decaying limb that was attempting to sink my body into the ground below. As I screamed, Matthew wrapped his arms around my waist, tugging. I slammed my foot into the abhorrent arm, and it buckled, freeing me.

“What the *fuck* is happening?” Gracie screeched, swatting a rotting hand. “Callum, what…”

But Gracie’s supposed ‘boyfriend’ had instinctively sprinted towards Billie-Jo, Zack’s partner, pulling the girl back from a ghoulish limb that was clawing towards her. Before Zack or Gracie could say anything about their partners’ telling displays of character, however, their bodies suddenly snapped backwards into crab-like positions, breaking their spines in one ghastly instant. My shrieks of terror were drowned out by those of Billie-Jo.

Callum restrained her as she tried to reach her boyfriend — the limp, lifeless boy who was enveloped by a growing mound of arms. Skeletal fingers dug into his body, pulling him into whatever nightmare lay beneath the dirt. I could only watch in unfathomable fright as the same fate befell Gracie. But horrifyingly, defying all reason, she took one final, painful gasp as she sank into the soil below. How she was still alive with a spine mangled so out of shape, I do not know. All I know is that it filled and *still* fills me with fear beyond comparison to imagine the horror of drowning in soil — or, worse, meeting whatever lurks beneath the surface of the island. *Him*.

By that point, Callum had successfully hauled the bawling Billie-Jo from the wretched forest clearing. And as the arms returned to the soil, the cult members emerged from the trees, led by Mr Wilson. In a state of horrified shock, unable to comprehend what we had just experienced, the six remaining islanders followed the producer and his cult back to the villa. We were no longer contestants. We were prisoners.

“The island takes part,” The cult members sang in unison. “It shows the black. Reveals a heart. Takes the slack.”

“Congratulations to our new couple!” Mr Wilson gleefully said. “Our viewers sensed a connection between Billie-Jo and Callum. Sometimes, it takes extreme duress to out the truth.”

And before we could summon the bravery tofight back, the producer left the villa, locking the doors behind him.

We’ve spent the past day trying to break free, but it’s a fortified compound. There’s no escape. And everybody’s been panicking about a note that was slid under the front door, which read:

*Elimination on Friday.* *Form bonds to stay safe. True love always prevails on the island.* *And every test is different.*

I scurried to the bathroom to recover the hidden phone from my bikini top. Weeks ago, Gracie hacked into the Wi-Fi router that DozMinus employees use — they have an office building next-door. She was happy to keep my contraband phone a secret because it meant that she could use the internet to message her folks. She was a lovely girl. I want to tell them what happened to her, but I don’t know how to begin.

I don’t even know how to explain it to myself.

I hope we find a way to escape before Friday.
