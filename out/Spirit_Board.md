  
The police found her car parked on the side of I 70, abandoned. She was dead, most people missing past 48 hours don’t make it. 

“We found her this morning in a wooded area, the dental records were a match.”

“Yeah, it’s her, how did -”

“The autopsy hasn’t been preformed yet, but they’re assuming it was blunt force trauma. There’s an open investigation on details I can discuss.”

The phone went silent and I nodded, in a daze. Feeling sick to my stomach, I and told the officer I had to leave, hanging up the phone. Walking  into my living room I grabbed a pillow, crying until my throat hurt and my eyes swollen. 

*Come on, you have to pull yourself together.* I blew my nose and hiccupped. The silence was peirced by a phone call. 

“This is Detective Thompson. I know this is a difficult time for you, but can you come into the station for questioning?”

“S..sure.” All the tears had left my voice, at this point everything was cold and numb, like wading through static. 

“Will three-thirty work for you?”

No time was good for me, but what choice did I have? If I refused it would seem suspicious. “Yea, I’ll come down.”

“I’m so sorry this happened, Ms. Kelly, but the more information we have the sooner we can solve this.”

*Or the sooner you can lazily pin this on someone and close the case.* “I understand, you have my full cooperation. I want this solved too.”

“Alright, we’ll see you then.”

The phone went silent. 

She had died horribly, and I was going to find out who did this and make them suffer. Suffer worse than she had. Outside of my house was a pile of firewood. I searched it until I found a plank of oak. I would make a spirit board, but not the cheap Ouija that Parker Brothers shilled out to curious teenagers.

I carefully burned the words into the wooden panel. The smell of scorched cedar stung my lungs and my eyes were sore from crying , it didn’t matter. I found a pattern of the sun and moon and followed each detail until both images were pristine.  I struck my index finger with a sewing needle and the thirsty wood absorb my blood. Choosing a smaller block of wood, I carved a planchette, it was nothing more than a simple pointer but it would work. Finally, I placed a photo of Lily at the top. By the time my work was completed my hands were sore and the sun was breaking out over the sky. 

Concentrating I asked what the board wanted. I was so exhausted the planchette floated to the letters with no fanfare.

*G O T O SLEEP.*

“Lily, is that you?”

*YES.*

“How can I help?”

*D R E A M*

 The air suddenly grew cold and I wrapped a blanket around me. I wanted to sink into the couch, into the floor and into the cold damp earth, never to wake again.

I woke to the weight of cold chains around my ankles,  pleading with the man to let me go. The smell of exhaust at the engine started and the searing pain at my body dragged against the road. 

I woke to my heart pounding and my couch drenched in sweat. It was dark out, the clock silently ticking. My phone read that it was close to three am, the witching hour. There were five missed calls from the local police department. 

I made some coffee and drank it black, enjoying it’s warmth and bitterness. My phone vibrated against me and answered. The tired officer on the other line, I told him that I passed out and I was sorry and agreed to meet him in the afternoon for questioning. 

I reviewed my handiwork from the night before. A plain cedar board with ornate wooden letters carved into it. The sun and moon looked ornate, the yes and no were slightly off center but that didn’t matter. I took some silver and gold paint and filled in the sun and moon before slapping a clear code of lacquer over the board. Parker Brother’s eat your heart out.

I got into my small silver car and left toward the police station. Entering the office to a tired looking officer with thinning hair. 

“Candace Williams, I’m here to discuss the Lily Henderson case.”

The officer’s eyes dropped. “Ma’am, I’m sorry for your loss. I’m detective Thompson. please come on back to the office.”

The office was surprisingly cozy. A simple desk with a computer sat next to a few office chairs. I took a seat in one as the Detective sat across from me.

“Ms. Williams, can I get you anything, a coffee or donut perhaps?” He smiled warmly.

“Coffee, if that’s ok.”

“Sure thing.” He left the room and came back with a small paper cup. “It ain’t Starbucks but it’ll get the job done. I am so sorry for your loss. Any information that you have about Lilly that will help us solve this case is would be greatly appreciated.”

“Do you know what happened to her?” A tear fell from my eye.

“It’s still under investigation. We're working to resolve this for you and her family.” He lowered his head. “Do you remember the last time you saw her?”

I racked my brain trying to remember when I last saw her. “It was three weeks ago. We were going to meet up and she never showed. I called her phone she never answered, I thought she was busy.  I should have checked in on her and have been a better friend.” My chest tightened as tears clouded over my eyes.

“Candace, none of this is your fault.” His tone calmed my frazzled nerves. “I have a daughter and I’m terrified of what could happen to her. Ma’am I’m going to do everything I can to get this monster off the street, but you’ve got to help me. Do she mention anyone following her? Any stalkers, or any jealous ex boyfriends?”

“Lily did mention her ex, his name was James Martin, I think. They had a major falling out and she stayed at my house for a few weeks, he had been harassing her online but I never thought it would come to this.”

“Do you know his address? What kind of vehicle he drove? Anything you can remember.”

“A Toyota Tacoma, black. I don’t remember a plate number…” A flashback of the vision interuppted my thoughts, the black truck, the chains, the screaming. “663YET, I think, I’m not a hundered percent sure on it.” 

“It’s ok, anything you can remember, you’re a great help. Do you want some water? You look a little bit peeked.”

“I’ll take some more coffee if you have it.”

“You’re going to be up all night.”

His warm nature made me smile in spite of myself as he refilled my cup of coffee and handed me a glazed donut, my stomach growled as I realized I forgot to eat since afternoon yesterday.

“Thank you, and it’s ok, I work night shift.”

“Understood. do you remember anything else about James?”

“He’s a big guy, reddish brown hair. He had a beard the last time I saw him. Lily would stay at my place to avoid him. He used to work at Wells Fargo with us, before they had layoffs.”

“Was he ever threatening towards you?”

“Not to my face, he didn’t like her hanging out with me. That's really all I have right now”

“Ok. Are you ok to drive home?” His eyes had a fatherly concern.

“I’ll be ok, if it makes you feel better I can text you when I get home.”

“I’d hate to impose-”

“It’s no problem.” Nodding,  I gathered my purse and left the station. I went home scrolled on my phone to James's socials. They were full of the same misogynistic speeches, hunting pictures and the confederate flag. But the photo of his truck and plate were in plain view.

At sunset I placed the spirit board on the middle of my alter and lit a black and red candle. Holding the planchette in my hands, I called Lily's name. It trembled as hit floated to Hello.

“Lily, is this you?” I asked, my heart beating rapidly.

*YES*.

“Was James the one that killed you?”

*YES.*

My rage surged. “We got him. I gave the police his plate number, he’s going to go away for a long time.”

 *N O T G O O D E N O U G H.*

*“*Not enough? I’m doing all that I can, what more do you want?”

*D E A T H P A I N H E L L.*

*“*I hope he gets the death penalty. He needs to suffer.”

The planchette jumped in my hands once again.

*Y O U C U R S E H I M*

I was a practicing Witch, but I didn’t curse people, then again, I didn’t need to curse anyone up until now. The murder of my best friend seemed a justified reason enough to.

My kitchen started to shake and cabinet drawers opened and slammed shut. the air grew so cold I could see my breath in front of me. And at my feet there was my phone and a mason jar. Shaking I picked them both up. I wasn’t practiced in curses, but this was a place to start. 

Lighting some black candles and dragons blood incense,  my bedroom was filled with a soft glow and the scent of resin, wax and roses. I wrote the name James Martin Will Suffer on a sticky note, then I crossed out the vowels and repeating letters. Taking the remaining letters I  rearanged them into a cryptic glyf. Folding up the sigil, spat on it in the Mason jar and covered it with dirt before sealing the lid.

I drove to a near by river. In the past I had volunteered and cleaned litter from its shores, I collected rocks from her banks.

“River spirit, I need your help. Take this jar and run it’s namesake to the bottom. May your water fill his breath and may my sister have her vengeance, by the name of Hecate and Morrigan”   The river carried it before bashing it into a boulder, breaking the jar into sharp shards before whisking it downstream. I prayed that the bastard would meet his end.

 Lily would pound on my walls every night and move my furniture. I went back to the spirit board asking if there was anything she wanted but it was the same message every time.

The grief and lack of sleep were affecting my job, my boss told me to take some leave and provided me the number to a grief counselor. When I was younger I used to bury myself in work to avoid pain, but now it only left me exhausted. I felt brittle as though my whole world was breaking around me. 

I would give my testimony and along with the evidence, James would be sentenced to death. My job was done, the curse was only an accelerant for the inevitable. Except the trial would never come. I went back to the police office and asked for Officer Thompson.

“Ms. Williams?” said the detective. “Are you all right, you seem tired.”

“I am, have you heard anything from James Martin?”

Thompson looked back and fourth. “I think you should come into my office, I’ll get you some coffee.”

“Thank you,” I said, as he lead me back to a small stuffy room shaded by blinds.

“I’m technically not supposed to discuss this with civilians, but I know you were her friend. James volunteered his vehicle, the tire tracks don’t match and he has a fairly solid alibi. He was helping some family move some equipment.”

“With his truck.”

“Yes, his truck was out, that’s why we don’t have a lead. Did Lilly have anyone else? Like any one that was giving her the creeps, maybe on social media?”

“No. Her and James were constantly fighting, she never told me about anyone else. I’m sorry. “

“Ma’am, I promise you we’ll do everything we can. We’re talking to her family, we’ll let you know if anything changes if you do the same.”

I felt completely numb as I got into my car, as though I were on another plane of existence, slowly fading away. Rage welled up inside me. But not at the kindly old officer, he was just doing the best he could. James planned this out, and dragged an innocent woman to death where no one could hear her scream. I needed to find proof.

My phone vibrated with a text from an unregistered number.  

:I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.  THEY WON'T FIND YOUR BODY:

My heart froze in my chest as I looked for the number, but the message had disappeared.  Fear burned into rage, the bastard wouldn't get away with this.

I visited James's once for a New Years Eve party, before he forbade Lily from talking to me. He lived on a farm with his parents but in a seperate house.  I parked my car in a field at the far end of his property and passed through a wooded area with a sharp ravine. Clambering down the steep path I crossed a wooden bridge over the river, the babble of the water over the stones calmed my jumpy nerves. Climbing up the steep slope I followed the path out of the woods. The estate loomed in the distance. 

Rather than taking the dirt road I walked through the pasture. A few sleepy cows walked passed me, unbothered by my presents. Reaching the estate, I  made my way to the enormous garage. The door was locked tight. 

The wind blew heavily against the garage, so heavy I had to brace myself. I ducked behind the structure as James walked out the door. Cursing under his breath he opened the door to the garage. In the corner loomed a stack of tires lying next to a chain. The image of Lily being dragged down the dirt road flashed through my mind and her screams made my flesh break out in a cold sweat.  A ringing cell phone broke the silence.

“Hello?” said James over the phone.

James's face fell, his skin paled as he ran back into the house. I took out my phone and snapped a photo of the evidence just as James  screamed as I took off running as fast as my legs would carry me. My lungs burned from the cold air as he was gained on me. My legs buckled under me as I made my way through the woods towards the ravine, the river churning beneath me. Turning around to face him, his eyes wide with surprise.

“Why are you trespassing on my property, Candy?”

The words caught in my throat, I was too scared to say anything as he inched towards me.

“Now, you’re going to be a good girl and give me you’re phone.”

“Or what? Why do you want my phone. If you have an alibi you have nothing to worry about.”

His eyes went blank. “What I did to Lily will be nothing compared to what I’ll do to you.”

*Death, pain, hell.* The words flashed through my mind. I listened to the river beneath me. James lunged towards me but I caught him off balance. He fell sharply down the ravine, landing on a large rock in the river. His bones poking through his shattered leg as he screamed in pain.

“Help!” 

Smiling,  I looked into his pleading eyes before pushing him into the current, not enough to sweep him away but enough to drag the broken limb. His screams were exquisite as buzzards began to circle overhead.

The drive home was peaceful, and I felt heavy and drowsy.  For the last time I rested my hands on the planchette as it drifted towards goodbye.
