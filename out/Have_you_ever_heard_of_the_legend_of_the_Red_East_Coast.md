Trigger Warning for Blood and Gore.  


It is said that if you close your eyes and say the word **Red East Coast,** you will start imagining it so well it would feel like you yourself have been transported there.  
  
What the place looks like according to the users of the subreddit of the same name the place looks like a beach with a pier and a red sunset enveloping the sky with a blood red color. It is said that the longer you imagine it the deeper the red becomes and it starts to bleed into everything. The sea water slowly turns red, so is the sand starting to resemble magenta and though no one has ever tried it, it is said that if you stay imagining it, the color will start bleeding into you too but not just the color, first your skin will redden, but at most it will pink but already looks too red presumably because of the lighting, what comes next is what might be disturbing, blood will start to seep out of your skin’s pores like they are trying to escape from your body, this would cause your skin to wither and flake off and reveal your muscles underneath.  
  
The one who has spread this rumor was said to be the admin of the said subreddit themselves, to know they were not alone in the experience. They actually theorized that it might be some sort of an ancient chant that affects reality itself. If you search the subreddit today, you will not find it anymore since the creator has removed it. I myself have not seen it happen since apparently something weird happened upon the subreddit itself before it suddenly just vanished.   
  
Firstly, everyone is sort of already familiar with reddit's orange tinge (or blue if you are using night mode) or if you are using light mode but with different themes like aquamarine or something, it is said that if you visited the subreddit at this time, the color was red. This was when that could not be customized for even with third party apps. More importantly there was an urgent post, right before deletion, that detailed why it was getting deleted, that was only up for about 5 minutes and then the whole subreddit went poof after that. No one had been able to take a screenshot because everyone was shocked. It had supposedly accompanying photos and that was allegedly so gruesome they were not actually sure if it got deleted by the admins or if it has violated Reddit TOS and that is the actual real reason why the subreddit got axed but Reddit at that time was very lenient with gore stuff or so I was told. When I asked my friend, who claimed he was there. What he told me was the words that he can remember from the actual post itself.  
  
*“Do not imagine the words* ***Red East Coas****t any further, especially when it starts spreading into your body you have to do your best to escape. There's a possibility you won't ever get back to reality and worse it may affect your reality. This photo is of my friend who I asked to try and asked if he's game to imagine it for about 2 hours and this is what happened to him. I don't know how to explain it to the authorities but...and some more crazy stories and whatnot.”*   
  
He said he did not read further than that cause it was starting to get ridiculous and was obviously just made up.  
  
I asked him if he ever tried to find it at some archiving websites that might have it stored somewhere and apparently he never bothered. So I myself set out to find this r/redeastcoast subreddit. It took me a while since it was not recorded in the Way Back Machine but I soon stumbled into an archive of documents of this subreddit. This site which I cannot remember anymore has archived a lot of obscure websites and subreddits. What is inconspicuous here is that it was taken at roughly the estimate my friend has said they saw the subreddit for the last time. Before its subsequent removal. I saw more than one post in fact. The one made by the admin was indeed concerning but the one made by another mod I reckon was also equally disturbing if not more it said   
  
*“Hey, Jerome. If you're reading this then delete the subreddit. Against my better judgment, and to prove it isn't some kind of prank I disregarded your warnings and tried it for myself. Now I'm not really scared of ghosts or anything spiritual. It's not that I don't believe in them but my mom was a psychic and basically our whole house is spiritually protected as she claims. I'm into the occult myself as you know and my extensive knowledge is what got me here in the first place, you told me that. It was stupid of me, in the* ***Red East Coast****, it's not just alternating reality. Every time it is imagined it grows stronger and gets closer to our world. It's not just an image in your head. What we're seeing everytime we imagine the* ***Red East Coast*** *is its stomach. It is literally digesting us alive. If you give it a platform. If you spread it, if it is seen by people then it will get stronger. It is starting to bleed into reality. So delete it, delete this subreddit now I don't think I have more time It's in my computer”*  
  
The whole thing looks like it has been typed in a hurry.  
  
Well if it is a prank then it is a greatly elaborate one. I did research further, for example I asked a tech friend if they could detect if the photos were edited and they said they were not, and the whole thing was red. Seconds before its deletion on January 10, 2022 it started glitching and it could be due to my lack of sleep but I saw the post had my name on it. Suffice to say I quickly threw that laptop out. Good thing it was a cheap one but that moment kind of haunts me. I have been seeing a lot of red stuff lately.
