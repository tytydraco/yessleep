2AM. My phone rings.

I already know the number.
I already know the voice.

And I already know she’s dead.

Sunny died three months ago. I was there—I watched as they lowered her casket into the ground, as the dirt covered the box that housed what was left of her. I was the last person at her gravesite.

So why does she keep calling me?

The first time it happened, I thought I was dreaming.

I was in bed, exhausted from a date with the first girl I’d let get close to me since Sunny.

Then my phone buzzed.

A FaceTime request. From her.

I froze. Stared at the screen.

It rang. And rang. And rang.

Then stopped.

A minute later, a voicemail.

No words—just breathing. Soft. Slow. Like she was waiting for me to say something.

I deleted it and told myself I was imagining things.

The second time, I was with the new girl. My phone lit up.

The contact name was hers—the girl I was sitting across from, who was very much alive, eating across the table.

But the call was from her number.

Incoming Call – New Sweetumweetumwey

I looked up, expecting to see her holding her phone. But her hands were empty.
Her phone was still on the table. Face-down at that.

Still, my phone buzzed in my palm. Incoming call.

Confused, I reluctantly answered.

Sunny’s voice—clear, teasing, just like I remembered.

“Why you ignoring me, Stinka?”

I stood up so fast I damn near took out the booth.

My date frowned. “What’s wrong?”

I looked at her. Then at my phone.

The call had ended.

Her phone screen was still dark.

The calls kept coming. Every night at 2AM.

Always from her number.
Always while or after I’d been with her.

She never responded when I spoke. But I could hear her.

That New Yorker that’s been in the South for years accent.

Soft whispers. Teasing laughs.

Sometimes, just breathing.

I stopped answering, but the voicemails kept coming.

Then it got worse.

I had to tell someone. I had to tell her.

Of course, she wanted proof.

So I pulled up my call log.

Nothing.

No missed calls. No received calls. Nothing.

The voicemails, then. Right?

Gone.

Every single one.

Luckily, I thought to record them on my work phone. I played it for her, expecting her to hear Sunny’s voice, that teasing laugh, the whispering.

But when I hit play—

White noise.

Loud. Scratchy. Suffocating.

Like the TV static from back in the day when you hit a dead channel—except this wasn’t just noise.

It felt like something was in it.

Then the new girl died.

Murdered in her apartment. No forced entry. No suspects. No answers.

One thing left behind: her phone, screen cracked, glowing at 2:00AM.

One message, written in her blood.

“2AM.”

Now, I don’t sleep.
I don’t date.

I don’t answer my phone.

But at 2AM, every night, it still rings.

And sometimes, when I close my eyes…

I swear I hear her breathing.
