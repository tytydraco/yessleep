Ok before I start two things 1.sorry for gramatical errors english is not my first language 2.this happened when I was 12 (f) so don't judge my actions.

I was a Thursday I was going back from school it was a hot sunny day and I was feeling sick from all the heat and lack of vntilation in my school. My friend couldn't assist me to the bus stop for some reason so I went there by myself whitch I usually don't do. It were the hours that everyone got back from work and the bus was late it was the old (almost falling apart) type of bus 

I was sceptical, I didn't want to go there it was full of people but I decided the best will be to get home as quick as possible. As I walked in I realised I could dream of standing close to a window so I just went to the front like I usually do.

When I realised a creepy obese Asian dude (like 30 maybe 40 yo) was stearing at me it was more uncomfortable knowing that I can't move because of the crowd but my true crime loving gut told me to get as far as possible so I walked further and the dude walked closer to me still staring at me I panicked and moved forward again thinking he would fuck off. No he didn't and he stared into my soul I couldn't take it anymore I was sick crouded and uncomfortable af I covered in cold sweat when I realized that two more stops and I will be heading out I was certain the dude will follow me.

But before I continue know this there were two older ladies standing in a narrow lead to the door I looked at them whit a help me expression and looked at the dude that was stearing at me they instantly realized I needed to get out so they moved so I can get to the door ad blocked my way as this happened the stop near mine appeared. So I got closer to the door thinking the guy will get off the bus and the scariest thing is he did as he looked confused he saw me in the window and looked so angry I don't have words for it he didn't follow the bus.

Releved I got off at the next stop and bowed my head to the ladies as a thank you to this day I think what would happened if I didnt love true crime so much and didnt get the gut feeling or if the lady didn't let me past them. I live in a neighborhood whitch is pretty safe but the road is deserted and looks like a short cut if the guy got me there no one would know.

Oh wow you read the whole thing thanks so much fellow redditor. I know this all could be a big coincidence but it scared the shit out of me also to kinda prove the title he was caut later trying to get a woman to go whit him and he assauted her. ALSO sorry for any grammar or any other mistakes.
