Hello. I discovered r/nosleep today through a podcast. The truth is, I’ve never been very good at using Reddit. I always get mixed up, and even though I’m not even 30 yet, I end up feeling a bit of a boomer.
But the experiences I saw described here really intrigued me, and I basically spent my entire day off devouring the stories. As I read, memories started to surface—my own experiences. Really strange things that happened to me, which I could share.

I’ve been studying occultism, spirituality, and chaos magic for a long time. Many things that didn’t make sense to me when I experienced them now make sense in the light of those studies. Still, there are some experiences that are very difficult for me to explain, and today I want to share one of them.

I haven’t mentioned yet that I’m Brazilian. What I’m about to tell happened in 2003, in the small town where I lived, called Moreno, in the state of Pernambuco.

First, I need to give a bit of context. Moreno is what we call a “bedroom community.” Most of the adults who lived there left in the morning to work or study in nearby cities, returning only at night to sleep and start all over again the next day. My parents were no different.

2003 was the first year I started staying home alone. My parents would drop me off at my grandmother’s in the morning. After lunch, the school van would take me to school for the afternoon. At the end of the day, the van would drop me back home, where I’d stay alone for a few hours until my parents arrived for dinner.

The street I lived on was a dead-end slope. There were three parallel dead-end streets branching off from a main road. Mine was the third. Everyone in the neighborhood knew each other, so my parents sort of trusted that I’d be safe, because the neighbors would be keeping an eye out.

That day, the teacher assigned a homework project in pairs. One of my classmates, Aleph, lived on the street next to mine, so he was the obvious choice. It was the start of the school year, and he hadn’t been to class yet—probably sick with a cold or something. I volunteered to pass along the details and do the work with him so he wouldn’t lose points. I wish I could remember which subject it was for, but I can’t. I just remember the assignment involved making something on poster board to present the following week.

At the end of the day, the school van dropped me at home. I’d always been a very sheltered kid and rarely allowed to go out and play. That year was my first taste of freedom and, like every kid left home alone for the first times, I was eager to use my “independence.” When I got home, I didn’t even change clothes. I just grabbed a snack and left. It must have been around 5:30 p.m. The street was strangely empty, which was rare. I decided to tell the neighbor we were closest with where I was going, so she could tell my parents if they got home before me. I called and called, but no answer.

Unlike most Brazilian neighborhoods, ours didn’t usually have walls around the houses. The front doors were often just barred gates that led to a porch, and then another door to the living room. Since her living room door was open, I could see inside through the gate—TV on, lights on, but no sign of anyone. I figured she’d stepped out to buy bread or something. I was too excited to go to a friend’s house for the first time to wait, so I just tossed my house key onto her porch so my parents could get it from her if they arrived before me (we only had one key back then).

Looking back, things were already strange at that moment—the street that always had people out front was empty. But at the time, I didn’t think anything of it. I just headed down to the street below. The sky was painted in blue and red, with the first stars peeking through. At the start of my street, where it met the one below, there was a fork: to the left, the road out of the neighborhood, and to the right, the main street that the other two dead-end slopes branched off from. At the time I didn’t notice, but thinking about it now—the left side had a few people walking around, even a somewhat busy bar. To the right, nothing. Not a single soul.

I kept going, thrilled with the feeling of being independent and responsible—taking care of myself, heading to a friend’s house. It was all so exciting to me then. When I reached Aleph’s house, which was on the main street, it was almost night. I called out for nearly ten minutes, but no one came. I started to think it was strange. I knew he was sick, but maybe he’d traveled? That didn’t make sense though, because I could see lights on inside through the windows. I could also hear the TV. I called again—nothing.

Aleph’s house was on the corner of the main street and the second slope. There was a side alley leading to the back. I checked the barred gate—no padlock on the latch. I decided to go in, thinking if I called from the backyard, maybe someone would hear me.

I opened the latch and stepped in. By then, at most, half an hour had passed since I’d left home. I walked slowly, nervous someone might scold me for coming in uninvited, but still hopeful I’d find Aleph there. Then, from a door that opened into the kitchen, my friend came out. He moved quickly toward me—not like he was going to attack, but in a way that was definitely strange—and grabbed my arm. I jumped, startled. He looked angry.

“What are you doing here?” he said quietly, but with clear anger in his voice.

It was definitely a weird reaction. I even stammered when I tried to answer.
“I ca-ca-called, but no one came. There’s this school project and—”

He cut me off, pressing his finger to his lips for silence, glancing around like he was searching for something outside. Then he pulled me inside. Something about the whole thing felt off—especially his expression. I’d never paid much attention to his eyes before. I remembered them being that shade of brown that can look green in certain light. But here, they looked like a sickly yellow.

We moved quickly through the kitchen and living room. I could hear someone laughing in another room—maybe his mother? I wasn’t sure if it was a man’s or woman’s laugh, but I knew he lived only with his mom and younger sister. When we reached the porch, he seemed startled by something—I didn’t see what, because I was looking back. I just felt him pulling me down.

We crouched behind the low wall of the porch. Something outside was moving, carrying a flickering light. I could see the glow through the gate, but not the source. It looked like fire, maybe a torch. I could also hear footsteps—heavy, dragging ones, like someone wearing cement boots. I watched the light move along the porch, not understanding why we were hiding. When I turned my head, I locked eyes with Aleph—his eyes wide, finger still to his lips, begging me for silence. Those bizarre yellow eyes stared at me like two marbles, in an expression of desperate pleading for me not to give us away. It lasted only a minute, but it was terrifying.

As soon as the light faded—whatever it was moving past the house—he whispered, “Go! Go the way you came in!”

I tried to stand, too scared to argue, but he grabbed my arm again.
“Don’t look back!” he added.

I just ran—through the living room, still hearing that same laughter, through the kitchen, out the side alley. I clumsily vaulted through the gate and fell hard to the ground. I must have scraped my knee or something. But as soon as I hit the ground, I heard someone calling.

“Danilo!” It was my mother, shouting from far away like she was searching for me.

And not just her. I heard other people calling my name too, like they were looking for me. When I got up, the street that had been completely empty minutes before was now full of people. The whole neighborhood seemed mobilized to find me. Someone quickly pointed at me—“There he is!”—and there was a whole commotion.

Before anything else, I looked at Aleph’s house and couldn’t believe it. I had just left there, but now the gate was closed, padlocked. All the doors and windows shut. No lights at all.

When my parents arrived, they cried, saying they’d been worried sick. I told them I’d only been out of the house for less than an hour. They, and the curious neighbors around us, exchanged visibly confused looks.

“What time did you get home from school?” my dad asked.

“About 5-something, like always,” I replied.

“Honey, we got home at 7 p.m., and we’ve been looking for you since then,” my mom added, still crying.

But I’d left the house at 5:30. There was no way it was 7 yet.

“What time is it?” I asked.

“11:12,” a neighbor said, checking his watch.

I looked to my parents for confirmation. They just nodded.

After things settled, I went home and explained why I’d left—but I didn’t mention the strange events at Aleph’s house. I just said I’d gone to work on the project with him. I got plenty of lectures. That night, I lay staring at the ceiling for a long time, unable to sleep, trying to make sense of what had happened. As for what happened at Aleph’s house—maybe there was some explanation. Maybe he was messing with me or something. But how could I have been gone for over five hours?

Could the clock have been wrong? No. I’d gotten home at my usual time, left right away without even changing clothes. It made no sense. The truth is, I never found an answer.

A few days later came Carnival, meaning four or five days without school. During that time, whenever I had the chance, I passed by Aleph’s house to check. Everything closed. No sign of anyone. After Carnival, when school resumed, Aleph showed up as if nothing had happened. I was hesitant to interact with him, but he seemed normal—talking, joking, laughing. His eyes weren’t yellow. When I finally worked up the courage to talk to him, he was surprised I’d been avoiding him—we were close friends. I promised to explain, but first I asked why he’d missed those days.

He told me he’d been on vacation with his family at Ponta de Pedras beach (in Brazil, it’s common for some kids to skip the first week of school to extend their summer break, only coming back after Carnival).

I froze. That wasn’t possible. If he was on vacation, who had I spoken to that day?

Eventually, I told him what had happened, and he just called me a liar. He never believed me.

I don’t know what happened that day. Parallel dimension? Alien abduction? Years later, I remembered the story when I read about other people’s experiences in a supposed parallel reality called “Seven Beyond” (Sete Além, in Portuguese). In those stories, there’s always some sign, inscription, or person telling you you’re in Seven Beyond. Aside from that, the resemblance is uncanny.

This isn’t the only strange thing that’s ever happened to me, but it’s one of the most memorable. And although other strange things have happened since, nothing like this has ever happened again.

What do you think?
