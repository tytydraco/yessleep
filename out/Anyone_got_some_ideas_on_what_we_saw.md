Now I ain’t one to go posting things to the internet. But I done googled this thing and swear to the Almighty Him, I can’t find nothing about this sucker. 

I live in the woods. I seen weird shit out there in the mountains. Some things that I still can’t describe really. I just went roundabout to say Appalachia ain’t something to fuck around with. 

But I always been here. I heard the stories. My Meemaw, God rest her soul, told ‘em all. I was a baby. But I ain’t never heard her talk about what I done saw out there a few days ago. 

We was out hunting last night. My son done come with me too. Boys about 23 now and done made his daddy proud. Seen some boars and deers running round earlier in the day close to the property line. We went out round dusk and got set up in our deer blind. 

We wasn’t out there 20 minutes before we started hearing the deer alarming. They done made so much noise we cracked our beers early. We waited bout an hour or two and they still ain’t calmed down. My boy looked at me and said “the hell is happening?” I done shook my head. I said “I don’t know, but something sure do got ‘em spooked.” 

We done heard that the coyotes been getting a little big for their britches from the neighbor bout 5 miles up the road. We ain’t seen ‘em but we been watching. We ain’t seen ‘em that night either. We ain’t even see the deer. Just heard ‘em. 

I ain’t one to fright easy, neither is my boy. But them deer all stopped making noise all at once and we done looked at each other like we done seen Meemaw’s spirit walk by or something. I felt like my stomach done fell out my body. My heart was in my throat and my boy looked pale and sweaty. 

A branch snapped  bout 100 feet or so away and we both looked to our right. 

Now I can only say what I saw. My boy won’t talk bout it. He been pretty quiet since then actually now that I think on it.

On our right, we done saw a dark shape in the trees. It looked human but it was bigger than me. When we locked eyes all of us froze. I ain’t too proud to say my whole body broke out in a cold sweat and I damn near shat myself. 

It was outlined by the moon but still couldn’t see it right. My boy was brave enough to flash his light at it and that’s when the thing almost got us. It rushed us and I could see it was completely black and its eyes reflected the light. 

When we got home, my boy sat down and we noticed he got scratched. Three slashes on his thigh. He got cleaned up and we tried to sleep. We both woke up and heard screaming in the middle of the night. Me and my son grabbed our guns and headed outside to see what the fuck was going on. 

The screams were coming from the tree line and we both ran back inside when the screaming suddenly stopped…

Anyone got some answers?
