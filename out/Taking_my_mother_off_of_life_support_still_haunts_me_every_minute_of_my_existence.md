Had a rough relationship with my mom. She was a drunk, chain smoker, lost custody of me at a very young age. Was a funny awesome person some days, and a monster the next. We had weekend visits, and I eventually lived with her for a few years as a teen. She was my mom, and of course I loved her despite it all. 

Yet somehow, I have overwhelming guilt about the end of her life, at just 64.
She lived hours away from me at this time. Had had a few heart attacks, open heart surgery, bypasses, etc, so I always expected that was how she would go. 

She had bad circulation as a result. Broke a toe, and due to the circulation, got infected. Was on antibiotics for over a year. Still no healing, the foot was getting close to having to be amputated. 

Then she got sick with a "stomach bug". 
Would call me and overshare, as I was used to, I'd be grossed out and tell her to talk to her doctor. His remedy? Take over the counter stomach meds. Ok. Fine. This went on for months. 

Then she went into the hospital for yet another bypass surgery. On her birthday, as it would turn out. Spoke to her that day, she seemed in good condition and spirits. Told me the surgery was delayed and she was being put on antibiotics because her "stomach bug" was keeping her from having it done, would be kept in the hospital a couple of days, surgery would be rescheduled, and all would be fine. 

Talked to her again the next day, and the next. 

The following day, I was in the middle of a work project and she called. 
I still have guilt to this day, but she asked if I was busy at work, I said I was, and she started laughing insanely and muttering something. I assumed she was given drugs and being prepped for surgery, so I let her go. I immediately got a text from her that didn't make sense at the moment, I now know it was about her having to be intubated. 

The following morning, while at work, I got a phone call that I declined from a random number. It kept calling, 6, 7 times maybe before I picked up. 

When I finally answered, I was told that my mother was on life support, was brain dead. I'm a 7 drive from her, they were asking for permission to pull the plug. 

I just kept saying no, this isn't possible, I don't know what you are saying. I was in shock. Literally. The doctor told me they would keep her on life support until I got there. 

I had to wait a few hours to be covered at work and to get a sitter to watch my kids, then drove to the hospital, 7 hours away. 

What I found, I will never forget. It haunts my dreams, my waking life, my thoughts. There isn't a day that I don't see this image of what I saw and how I dealt with it, that will not let me rest, 4 years later even. 

I was put into full PPE, saying she was dangerous to me, despite her doctor saying she should take over the counter medicine. She was in a quarantined ICU room. I still needed to see. I didn't believe. I woman who seemed normal 2 days ago.... 

I walked in, prepared for the worst, was told she was brain dead. So hard to process, because I addressed her, and her head rolled towards me, eyes open. She made vocal noises. I was sure she heard me. Her body moved. Her eyes were open and moving around, what I thought was the room, scanning for me. 

I demand from the doctor answers, she was in my mind alive and interacting with me. 

He explained this is normal for brain dead individuals and that I should stop believing I could save her. He told me her bowels had atrophied, from the stomach infection, and even if there was "someone home", which he assured me there wasn't, she was long past saving. 

I consented to the "pulling of the plug", and was asked to sit with her, but I just couldn't. I can't explain it, but I just couldn't do it. 

Instead I went to the coffee shop, bawling the whole time and waited. She was gone in less than 20 minutes 

It's a memory that just can't be scraped from my memory, no matter what I do. 
The visual, my guilt despite not really owing her anything, all of it. It keeps me up every night, and the image haunts me during the day too.
