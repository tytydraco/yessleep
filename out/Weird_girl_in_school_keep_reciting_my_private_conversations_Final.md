I’ve been doing intensive research on how Azra, the weird girl, could know my private conversations that she wasn’t a part of and recite them back to me word for word. All the answers didn’t make sense, some people commented on my [***first post***](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1b9sj1c/weird_girl_in_school_keeps_reciting_my_private/) that she could have bugged my phone. I really felt stupid that my mind would go to her microchipping me before I would consider her installing spyware on my phone! So yesterday I kept my phone in a drawer and left for school without it, we’ll see tomorrow if she will recite any conversations from today.

I went to school confident for the first time since her party because I finally found a logical explanation, my friends even commented about how I seemed “back to my old self” but then while I was on my way to the science lab on the top floor, I saw her standing in the middle of the staircase reciting my conversation with my friends just 20 minutes ago, a conversation that I had with them in a closed classroom that she was not in! I froze, her expression changed, she used to recite the conversations like a robot, no tone or expression just regurgitating words while staring at me angrily. Today she’s smirking, she’s copying the tone, the chuckles, the gasps, the sighs.. I was scared and most importantly angry, forget how, WHY is she doing this?! It’s been a full week of me feeling utterly violated, thinking twice before saying anything to anyone, searching myself for bugs and finally leaving my phone only to see that she’s enjoying every second of my torment! I pounced on her and pulled her hair with all my might while yelling at her to “FUCKING STOP” everyone around us panicked and started screaming. A teacher finally came in and took us both to the counselor’s office.

I was still fuming, I looked down at my hands they were still rolled into fists and I was holding big clumps of her greasy hair, there is even some blood at the roots but I think I remember her smirking even while I was violently pulling her hair! My anger turned into fear, who is she? Or rather what is she?! what have I done? Why didn’t I just walk away like I always did? I started crying in panic, Ms. Linda, the counsellor, hung up the phone, apparently she was asking my parents to come in.

She excused Azra then looked at me with a smile: “Anne, nothing excuses what you did, but I’m sure you were reacting to something, what was it? I can only help you if I know.” I kept sobbing, I can’t speak, I know she’s listening, I don’t know how, but I know she’s listening!

About an hour later my mom came in, she spoke to Ms. Linda privately then drove me home. On the drive she told me that I’m suspended for a whole week, unless I’m ready to share details of what happened in which case I’ll only be suspended until Friday. I stayed quiet. My dad heard about the incident later in the day and decided to ground me for a week as well, he took my phone and tablet and only kept my laptop so I can catch up on schoolwork.

I literally have nothing else to do for a whole week so I decided to keep researching until I found an answer, I hopped to my laptop and started looking her up, I found her mom’s Instagram page, she’s very bubbly and sweet and apparently she’s from Turkey and their family moved here 2 years ago. She never posts anything about Azra, her dad has a facebook account but the last update dates back years.

I started looking up telepathy, mind reading, paranormal spying but nothing caught my eye, I added “Turkey” to the keywords and found a ton of articles on “djinn”, creatures that are mentioned in the Quran and are invisible to humans, some theorize that they exist in another dimension, others just believe that they can shapeshift or turn invisible. Maybe it’s the horror geek in me but something about this seemed very intriguing so I kept digging. I found youtube videos of reformed Muslim black magic users who mentioned signing deals with djinn, something similar to the urban tales of selling your soul to the devil in exchange for success. The black magic “wizards?” however didn’t get international fame or endless wealth they just got um, control? They were able to send djinn to harm people they need harmed, either by making them sick, scaring them or even killing them. Some of them controlled their cohorts, Muslims believe that every human has a cohort who is basically an evil djinn who pushes them towards sin, and the name of the cohort is the human’s name in reverse, my name is Annabelle so I guess my cohort’s name would be Ellebanna? Some use black magic to control their cohort alone and send them over to other people to spy on them or find more information on them by talking to their cohorts.

I don’t know if I spent too much time reading about this but for some reason it started making sense to me, a lot of the videos and articles mentioned that reading the longest sura in Quran will supposedly ward off djinn and cohorts for 3 days. I’m not the most devout Christian, but it still felt wrong to turn to another religion. I thought I would go to church first and look for answers there, but then remembered that I can’t talk about it, I don’t know if that’s really what she’s doing or if Azra’s cohort “Arza?” can read over my shoulder or even hear my thoughts but I know that whatever method she uses she can hear all my conversations. Thinking back maybe I shouldn’t have watched any videos, but I used my earbuds could she hear through them? I wish I had a rule book.

I decided it would be ok to read 48 pages from the Quran at least to confirm that this is actually what I’m dealing with, but it was very difficult. I could barely understand a word specially that I had been up so late so I decided to play it on youtube and listen intently, I found a video that read each page in Arabic then translated it, I played the video and moved to bed, I was so tired I could feel each muscle relaxing as I laid on the mattress, I dozed off and woke up to a loud thud, I opened my eyes but couldn’t move a muscle the video had stopped, the room was dark and I saw Azra in the corner of my room, I couldn’t move my neck so I only saw her from the corner of my eye but I could swear she was smirking, I tried moving, screaming, anything but I was completely paralyzed I could only move my eyes. She started moving closer, I started sweating, I couldn’t even breathe at this point it was as if my lungs were frozen solid. I felt her lips touch my left ear “I own you, through Ellebanna you are mine, you will live for me, there is no escape” she wasn’t screaming but her voice was incredibly loud and echoed in my brain as if she was using a microphone. She then suddenly disappeared, the lights were back on and it felt like a huge weight was lifted off of me as I regained control over my body, I ran off to my parents room and dove in between them while crying hysterically my parents were freaked out and kept asking me what had happened but I just buried my face in my mom’s shoulder and kept crying, they both hugged me till I fell asleep.

The next morning, they took me to the hospital where I had hours of tests done and the final verdict was stress and anxiety, so I was referred to a psychiatrist. My parents insisted that I see her immediately even though I kept assuring them that I was fine. The psychiatrist let me in, asked me about the incident and how I was in general, I told her I was upset because I fought with my best friend and that I’m fine now because I know that nothing can keep us apart. She asked if recommending a visit to my best friend would help, since she knows I’m grounded, I told her that it wasn’t necessary, that she knows I’m sorry and that I knew she forgave me. The doctor told my parents I was fine and the emotional outbursts are normal at my age and she recommended a follow up session in a month.

My parents still seem concerned but I kept assuring them that I was fine, I was actually beyond fine, I heard Arza’s voice inside my head on the way back home telling me that Azra is pleased with me and that she will need me in a few days. I don’t know what she needs, but I know that I am ready.
