Any historian has likely heard of the Annunaki. Legendary deities worshiped in ancient Mesopotamia. But most people are blind to what they truly are.  



They were aliens. They came to earth before humans were fully developed and mated with early primates, their descendants being early humans. They left but returned after their offspring developed. The early humans viewed them as gods. These aliens capitalized on this and enslaved humanity, turning them into obedient servants. They built monuments and palaces, these structures now known as the pyramids.  After years of being on earth, the Annunaki discovered something that terrified them: death. On their planet, they could live for millenia. But  they were slowly dying from the diseases of earth, which they had no protection from. And so, they left. But first, they mated with a few other humans. These humans and their descendants would be stronger and smarter than the rest of their kind, leading to them taking control and leading humanity.   



Flash forward a few hundred years. To be specific, the 1960’s. Most humans have lost the Annunaki genes, with the exception of the descendants of the humans the Annunaki mated with the last time they visited. the Annunaki return to earth. They want their slaves back, but they still couldn't remain on earth for too long, lest they become infected with something fatal. But they planned for this after they left. They enlist their remaining descendants to help seize control. By Pulling a few strings, the descendants of the Annunaki are put into positions of power.  
 They help keep humanity from realizing what’s happening. Every scandal, every terrorist attack, every war, every pandemic, all of it was intentional, a method to distract us from the Annunaki slowly invading. 



They created social media to make humanity argue and get into needless conflicts, so we are too busy fighting each other to see what's going on. They created fast food to stop humanity from being strong enough to fight back. They created hallucinogens and discreetly sold them as a cover for any evidence humans spotted of the Annunakis presence. Every step humanity took, the Annunaki paved the road.  



I know because I saw it. I was walking home from work when I saw something glowing in a construction site near my house. I decided to take a detour to see what it was. What I saw terrified me. A large metal object was in the middle of the site. But that isn't what scared me. I was shaken to my very core when I saw the beings standing next to the craft. I don't know where to begin describing them. I felt as if I was about to pass out. Then I noticed someone else: a human. Or at least it looked like one. When I looked a little closer, I recognized her as one of the candidates for mayor in my town's upcoming election. She exchanged a few words with the beings. I couldn't make out what, and by this point I didn't care. I took off running, not stopping until I made it home. 



The next day I quit my job and spent almost 15 hours at the library, trying to find anything on what I saw. After a week of research, terrified of being found, I went to my local history museum and asked to take a closer look at some of their artifacts from ancient mesopotamia. My request was denied. But, I didn't give up.  



That night, I gathered my courage and broke into the museum. I wished I thought ahead more, because I was caught before I found anything of value. When the police took me in, I decided to explain what I saw. They laughed, of course. I wouldn't have believed it myself if I hadn't seen it. Apparently, I had severely damaged some of the other things on display, so the case was taken to court. Again I tried to explain what had happened. And again nobody believed me. My lawyer decided to plead innocent by insanity. I was sent to a insane asylum the next day. I managed to smuggle in a notebook and a pen, so I decided to use it to write everything I’ve learned, as well as to write my suicide note. plan on ending it all tomorrow, since I don't plan on being around when it occurs. 



You see, the Annunaki had been planning to slowly invade us for a long time, but there is one thing they did not consider.  
their plan is backfiring. Humanity has become paranoid and violent. Slowly manipulating us won’t work anymore. So they need to take earth by force.  



World war three is on the horizon, and the enemy is not another country. It’s another world. And the worst part? 



They are already here. They were always here. They will always be here.  


*************************************************


The real question is: will we?


“This was all he left?” The warden asked, after he finished reading the note.


“Yes.” I responded. At the time I was a guard at the asylum. I found the body and the note earlier that day. “It’s strange though. His story stayed consistent the entire time. It almost like…” 


“Like what? A madman looking for validation?” The warden said angrily. “Do me a favor and dispose of this note.” 


The warden left the room, but the I remained  with the note. Something about what I read stuck with me. I took the note home and reread it over and over again. 


Eventually I realized I believed it.


Of course I knew that I couldn’t go public with this. Even if people did believe me, I would be silenced before I could reveal the truth.


And that is what brings us here. I decided that the only way I could bring awareness was like this. I don’t know how long I have, so let me say this: don’t listen to them. They only want to weaken you. Be carful and expose the truth.
