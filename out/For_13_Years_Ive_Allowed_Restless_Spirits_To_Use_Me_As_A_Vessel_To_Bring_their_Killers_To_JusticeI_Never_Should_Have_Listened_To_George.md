I was in a head on collision thirteen years ago. When I woke up, I had what I call a traveler.

I’ve become a vessel for restless spirits. People that had their lives cut short by someone else. I help them find closure. I follow their lead; a soft still voice that’s felt more than heard.

I’ve taken on a kind of nomadic lifestyle. I feel that the work I do, the work that we do, is more important than anything else.

I’ve driven across this country so many times just waiting for one of my travelers to hail me.

An Uber for the dead.

Once they’ve found me, we go to work.

No journey is the same. There have been a few times where I almost lost my life, but it’s worth it.

Last week I was driving through the desert, and a spirit by the name of “George” settled into me.

He was a strong spirit. The strongest I had ever felt. 

He directed me to drive to Virginia.

From what I could tell, he was involved in a crash and the person who found him and nursed him back to health was also responsible for his horrific death two months later.

George was kept bedridden and tortured for two months by a monster with the name of Lawrence Covey.

I drove into Richmond, and I found Covey’s house, but it was not yet the time to confront him.

I found a hotel close to his house.

George was an odd spirit. 

Cagey. 

His mutterings were vague one minute and overpowering the next.

Travelers give me images or names of the killer, direct me to their remains, so I can contact the authorities. George did not. George had no interest in taking me to where his body was buried.

Instead, I could feel him looking into my mind. Scouring it for information.

I should have realized that something was wrong.

He directed me to drive down the business district. He was looking for something that he saw in my mind.

We passed by a Best Buy and he directed me to go inside. I bought several items under his suggestion and when I got back to the hotel, he guided me along. I grabbed the tool kit from my trunk and took everything into my room.

I let him move my hands. 

I butchered two laptops and a couple of phones, added some wires, and cobbled together some sort of electronic monstrosity.

I had no idea what it was, but I could feel that George was pleased.

Once I plugged in the makeshift thing, he let me know that it was time to confront his killer.

I should have known something was wrong. 

It was a short walk to Mr. Covey’s home. An old home surrounded by the most glorious roses I had ever seen.

When the frail old man opened the door, I followed George’s lead and let him suggest the words.

“Lawrence Covey.”

“Can I help you?”

“George sent me.”

“Who?”

“ The man you nursed back to health after the crash. The man you tortured for two months. The man you killed fifty eight years ago. You’re about to go to jail, old man.”

Realization crossed his face. 

Fear.

He slammed the door.

I asked George what he wanted to do next, but there was no response. I couldn’t feel him anymore.

It felt like he left.

It had never happened this way before.

I honestly felt used.

I was tired and confused. I decided to go back to the hotel and get some sleep.

The thing that we had built made comforting noises. Little clicks and pops over a constant hum.

It lulled me to sleep.

I had terrible dreams. Dreams of death.

Dreams of total destruction.

-

Later that night, several men broke in while I was asleep and held me at gunpoint.

Men from the F.B.I.

Covey came in behind them.

He looked at me and then over to the machine. His eyes went wide and he hurried over to it. He asked one of the agents for their gun and he emptied the gun into the thing.

The hum was gone.

The machine was destroyed.

He looked back at me and started to laugh.

“So are you, some kind of half assed psychic?”

“I help spirits find peace. I help them bring their killers to justice.” He laughed again. I was frightened and confused. I had no idea what was going on.

“You say the spirit “George” guided you, eh?”

“That’s right.”

“He asked you to build this thing here?”

“Yes.”

“Apparently its psychic abilities extend into death. You’re a dumb son of a bitch, whoever you are! This spirit that has been communicating with you, “George”, is not of this planet. It was a scout.

 I terminated its life all those years ago because it was a threat to our very existence. Congratulations. You’re going to be responsible for the destruction of our planet. The spirit of that awful thing has crossed the barrier of death and used you to build what I have to presume is a homing beacon or a distress call. If his “people” picked up that signal, the human race is over.”

I can still feel George inside of me somewhere.

He’s laughing.

He’s waiting patiently.
