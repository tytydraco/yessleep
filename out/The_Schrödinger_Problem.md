I was locked in a box once, a few years back. There was a friend of mine, and we'll call him Ryan. A great guy, but also an advocate for admittedly dubious experiments, and I, at the time, wasn't exactly the smartest tool in the shed.

As it happens, we were friends by convenience; both in college, sharing a dorm for the foreseeable future after things fell through with my last roommate. We'd met a few times at some of the parties thrown here and there, and whilst we'd largely run in the same circles, there had never been a point where we truly talked until getting a room together.

Through the first month, I learned that he was a Science Major. At the time I was still pursuing philosophy; you'd be surprised at how interesting the conversations can get. Most people don't tend to realize that philosophy covers a lot of the weird muddied ground that science struggles to touch.

Well it happened, at one point, that we touched upon a topic that crosses rather perfectly into both. That is, of course, schr√∂dinger's cat. I won't summarize the topic, as it's a rather famous theoretical study that a simple Google search would get you answers for.

We had a bunch of debates on the subject. Not just what happens to the cat, but also what happens to the inside of the box, or the poison; any number of potentialities that might grow from one singular decision. There were even whispered conversations, as of we were afraid of being overheard, of a more humane experiment under the same concept.

What we ended up doing was not at all humane. 

Ryan, despite being a great guy overall, has a bit of a drinking problem. It's never something I fully realized until after what we had done. That night was a party night; we'd just gotten past our mid-terms, and everyone was celebrating. I hadn't forsaken drinking entirely het; that would only come after, so naturally I was right beside him as we shoved our way into some pompous rich kid's house.

The idea sparked when the two of us were already swaying on our feet. It was a simple, stupid decision, based largely around what we found in the guy's mom's medicine cabinet. A small vile, with a ridiculous skeleton label; like a fucking cartoon trying to label something as poison as clearly as possible. Frankly I'm surprised there wasn't a green spray of fumes when we opened the thing.

Ryan was the one who said we should put it in a beer bottle and see who pukes first. As a joke I suggested that one of us could lock ourselves in the bathroom with two beer cups; one laced with poison, the other free of it. Naturally, that's when Ryan saw the shed, one without any windows, and not a single person standing near it.

I still remember those words, "What if someone else does it, and we go in there together,"

Looking back, I realize how insane that sounds. But it doesn't matter, because that's exactly what we did. We poured the poison into an empty cup, and got one of Ryan's friends to pour it into one of our beers while we had our back turned. They must've thought we were playing some weird derivative game of "guess the liquid".

The night air was stark against my face, almost sobering; I remember that much. If only it had been sobering enough. 

There was dust and cobwebs in the shed. An old lawn mower was posted against the easternmost wall, and an old tool shed stood opposite. As Ryan went to close the door, I noticed someone running across the lawn. But it didn't matter, because he grabbed his glass at the same moment I did mine. 

It felt like an eternity passed in that single unbroken moment before things began happening. The first, and the moment I remember the most, was the singular instance whereupon the lawn mower disappeared completely. There was nothing to take its place beyond this large, gaping hole. A hole upon which I saw the first eye, blinking in the same exact moment that Ryan dropped to the floor.

My slightly drunken confusion was overtaken by horror as I turned towards my friend's writhing body, only to find him standing there, perfectly fine. He was looking towards me with a different expression of fear on his face as he took a step back, shouting something incoherent.

I looked around wildly to try to find what he was staring at, only to find a single rusted lawn mower blade on the floor, stones with blood. The sound of gargling ricocheted through the confines of the shed as I was once again forced to stare at Ryan's... perfectly fine, upright form.

At this point, a headache was starting to brew underneath my eyelids, when I fully realized that I wasn't standing in the shed anymore. In truth, I wasn't standing on Anything. And there was Ryan, some paces away, but his body was undulating; like river currents were sprouting and creasing his flesh, pushing back his skull in pulsating waves. I saw foam crash, bursting out of his eyelids in horrid, slow motion gurts.

There were ten billion fractures all spiderwebbing out from his flesh, all of them sprouting into different versions of my friend, and almost all of them dying. I didn't see a choice, I took a deep breath and started running, desperately grasping at the straws of flesh that made up the monstrosity he was becoming. Bit each tear revealed a new layer, some fresh batch of gasping, wheezing, and bleeding. Never did there seem to be a single version of him that did not die in some horrific fashion.

I regret what I did. In that moment the fleshy form of Ryan and his ten billion faces had grown to the point that it had fully overtaken whatever environment we existed in. So I picked. I grabbed hold of a tender bone, one whose death I knew as intimately as I did the Earth under my feet. I picked a death that implicated me the least; one that would've happened in highschool, before we'd ever gotten to know each other.

When everything snapped into place, I was in the garage alone. The place where the lawn mower had been was still empty, still slithering and snaking with things that hurt my eye to see. I knew if I stayed it would spread, and spread enough to eat me alive. So I took a deep breath and opened the door.

"You okay man?" I can't remember how I answered that question, all I knew was that I was staring into the face of one of Ryan's friends, not mine.

The worst part is that I cam still hear him sometimes. And at night, I swear I can see his face, bursting through the walls, with those wrangled and writhing limbs crawling from every surface they can connect to.
