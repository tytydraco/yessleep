"Bless you!”

The kid was probably 16, tops. His hoodie was green and gold and read ‘Go Panthers!’. He looked like he’d just come from basketball practice, the dewy complexion of someone who’s been sweating, the loosely hung hoodie draped diagonally on his shoulders as though it were thrown on in a hurry after changing. 

I thanked him and smiled as I adjusted my duffel bag on my shoulder. He reminded me of another kid I knew, one I’d semi-adopted. Nathan was smaller, and assuredly stranger, than the kid I was looking at, but they both had an air of affability to them. Like a golden retriever, in the way they couldn’t even conceive of being betrayed or rejected. Like they’re a happy little guy and they assume everyone else is, too. 

My phone read 5:30, which explained the fullness of the bus. Various walks of life sat, gazing out the window or smiling at their phones. I doubted any of their reasons for being there were as ludicrous sounding as mine. Most of them were probably going between homes, workplaces, schools, errands. Me? I was on my way to a stakeout. But Piper, you do I.T, what are you staking out? A freaking server? Yes, dear readers, albeit begrudgingly and condescendingly, I was in fact staking out a server. More specifically, an entire host of servers, a virtual compound where ninety percent of my clients data and processing went through. 

According to James, the scrawny redhead that gave me an admittedly pretty impressive report on the whole situation, every night for the last three months, every server in the building shuts off and comes back on 11 minutes and 6 seconds later. During this time, the servers simply refused to turn back on. The first time it happened, they thought maybe a rat chewed through the ground and some kind of electrical event happened, until the system sprang back to life 11 minutes later. They tried swapping out power cords and components and eventually replacing the entire server stack to no avail. They even had a few people quit because they were convinced the place was haunted. 

I filed that information away. It’s always good to know how many of the people around you are human. If some of them quit because they were spooked, it can’t be all supernaturals working there. James appeared normal, except for when I’d catch orbs of light floating around him out of the corner of my eye. I decided to let sleeping Fae lie, as the attention of the Fae is not something you want to attract, as a general rule.  

My truck was in the shop. Anything with a motherboard, I can wrangle. Transmission? Not so much. Plus I love my truck, but it’s not exactly discreet. You can hear my baby from two city blocks away. So, I was on the bus, jam packed with journeys and chugging along a few streets from my stop, where I’d exit and trek a mile or so to the scattering of trees next to the server building. 

I was scanning the passing streets, trying to gauge when my stop was coming up when sound erupted from the left. The bus lurched and as the driver fought for control, the middle-aged lady in the red jacket beside me spilled out of her seat like a sack of potatoes. I heard a cruel set of knocks as she banged down the yellow taped step and eventually landed in a crumpled heap at the feet of an older guy sitting in the row seat below. I jerked my head toward the sound and saw a couple of kids standing on the street corner, in the same uniform as the boy on the bus with me. Gold and green, Panthers. The commotion of other passengers died down as the bus straightened out, narrowly missing the fire hydrant on the opposite side of the street. A collective sigh of relief escaped from the group before people started chattering about the source, some angrily, some in light-hearted relief. 

The two boys had sprinted off as soon as the bus swerved, snatching something off the ground as they fled. Stupid kids, I thought. I turned my attention towards the two college aged boys who’d helped lady in red up after her fall. One of them wore a hoodie decorated with kittens in baskets and the other had gauged ears, with chunky cheese wheel earrings. I silently named them Tom and Jerry. They were locked in chatter, smiling at each other and laughing, casually including lady in red in the conversation. My expression softened. One set of boys does something stupid; one set does something noble. I guess it all balances out in the end. The lady was a bit banged up, though, blood smeared on her bottom lip and what I can only assume was a tooth clutched in one hand. 

As the bus finally settled back to the quiet rumbling of scattered conversation, I noticed Lakeside Drive flash across the digital display towards the front of the bus. I tugged the stop line and braced myself as we halted to a stop where I clambered past the horde of travelers, stepping out onto the sidewalk. As I watched the bus pull off, I noticed a remarkably polished lady in a turquoise suit waving gracefully, fingers waggling in the air as she watched me through the window. She mouthing something at me through dark purple lipstick, but I couldn’t make it out. I assumed she was just saying goodbye and gave her a small smile and wave. Her smile seemed smug. It sent shivers down my spine, but I shook them off. With what I deal with every week, I can’t allow myself to be spooked by a stranger waving me off a bus. At least that’s what I thought, because I am stupid. 

I did a little hop, readjusting my bag on my shoulder and began my trek. Half an hour later, I was dragging ass onto the backend of a hill in the brush near the building, panting like I was running from the cops. I promised myself, once again, that I would find more time for cardio. Seriously, this time. 

I chugged half the water I’d brought with me and started unloading. I had an EMF reader and transmitter, a heavy-duty pair of binoculars, several herbs used for spirit protection and some charms a Witch friend of mine had provided me. Along with the usual tools. The ones normal IT people use, the ones who’ve never had their organs turned around. That was a rough night. I can personally guarantee you that our bodies are not reversible, and any organ not in it’s assigned seat will go on strike. 

Squatted in the brush, surrounded by my tools, I sent James the confirmation that I was setup and settled down for my long wait. I tugged my notepad and lucky mechanical pencil out of my bag, dropping the open notepad on my lap, open to the first blank page. I documented the time I got there, the tools I brought, and the possibilities I wanted to rule out first, underlining pieces I wanted to return to. 

I was putting the final touches on my notes when the lights in the building across from me shut off. The outage happened at a different time every night, but always between 10pm and 3am. I glanced up at the sun still dropping gracefully into the clouds to the west. It couldn’t have been past 8pm by that time, so it was well ahead of schedule.

Brow furrowed, I tugged my phone out to check the time and gasped, flinching back. My normal background of Jeri Ryan blowing me a kiss was replaced by a goopy black color, spilling chunky globs out of the screen, dripping onto my hands in a physics defying waterfall. Fat red swelts bounced up on my hands wherever the slime touched, swelling up in seconds like a bloated bullfrog. 

“FUCK!” I screamed, emphasizing how competent I was at undercover work. 

The phone flew out of my hands as I frantically flapped them around, the hiss of sizzling flesh filling my ears. I had a surreal moment of panic as smoke billowed from my peeling hands, my gaze darting from side to side, waiting for the brush to catch fire. The smoke was pitch black, quickly filling my field of vision, and I felt a tingle snake up my wrist and around my arm, transforming manically into sharp flaying pain. Stumbling out of the bush, I beat the hell out of my growingly scorched body, trying to tamp out the rapidly engulfing flames. 

I screamed aimlessly, dropping to the ground, rolling around to try to dampen the blaze wrangling it’s way across my entire body. It traveled up my arms, and in the few mad moments before it reached my chest, I made out symbols carving their way across my bicep, orange lettering and shapes dancing elegantly over my shoulder blades. I had stopped breathing a full minute ago, strangled by smoke and paralyzed by pain. I felt the carvings wrap around my throat, squeezing the narrow pipe there, sitting where my lungs had already crept up, desperate for a gasp of oxygen. As the flame made it’s way over my belly, I could feel the intricate carvings, the fiery text being carved out with a flaming blade. I lost control of my entire body, I felt my bladder release, and had an absurd moment where I pondered over why the wetness did nothing for the screaming sound and smell of burning flesh. 

The blinding light around me intensified, orange and red sparks encompassing my vision, snapping left to right and up and down in lost sigils. My back arched off the ground, I wasn’t breathing but I heard myself pleading, broken, primal, animalistic sounds coarsely escaping from my charred lips. I felt myself dissolving, breaking down, disintegrating into the heat and the kicked up dust and the mad beating heartbeat of the flames. 

Then I sneezed.

“Bless you!”

I opened my eyes, sucking breath into my lungs. The kid was standing there, the loosely draped jacket, one hand resting loosely on the handrails.  

“You okay?” he asked. Several passengers were stealing glances at me, some were just staring. I smiled weakly at them before dropping my gaze to my hands clasped in my lap, clean, healthy, untouched.

Now, look. I’ve seen Final Destination. But in my line of work, there are a lot of weird explanations for things and they don’t all align with the movies. I shook my head, trying to clear my mind. Was this a vision? Did someone send it to me? To warn me? Just to mess with me? I took a sneaky survey of the bus. I’m not sure what I was looking for. Some guy in a blue wizard hat with yellow stars on it, waving a staff at me and laughing menacingly? 

Everyone looked normal to me. As normal as any humans do. My gaze landed on the front right seat, where the elegant woman in the turquoise dress sat, a black leather planner splayed open in her lap. She wore a jade hairpin, tucked neatly into a tight black bun piled on top of her head. She paid me no attention, one leg crossed over the other, playfully kicking the air as she twirled her pen in her hand. She cocked her head suddenly, shooting me a devious smile right as the explosion went off from the side of the bus.

My focus snapped over to my right and I dumped my bag, leaping to catch lady in red as she toppled out of her seat. I clutched her clumsily and glanced over my shoulder, catching one of the boys holding a hand over his mouth before scooping up a used firework from the street. We stayed locked in an awkward embrace until the bus steadied, and people began the commotion of commentary. Tom and Jerry gave me a quiet applause from their seats as I propped her back on the cushioned seat. 

“Thank you, young lady! A fall like that is no good for a woman of my age,” she chuckled kindly at me before settling back in her seat, clutching the railing for stability. 

As I lowered carefully back to my seat, I noticed basketball boy wasn’t making eye contact with anyone, staring at his shoes and clinging to the handrail. I wondered if the boys who set off the firework were playing a prank on kid on the bus. The panic on one of the boys’ face made me think the bus swerving and nearly taking out the fire hydrant was not in the plans for the prank, which made their mad dash afterwards make more sense. Stealing a quick glance at Lady in Red, I wondered if she was involved. Supernatural folk are big on tests, big on just desserts. Did she send me the vision so I would save her from her fall, prove my valor? Seemed like a lot of work for someone who would appear to already have the power to save herself. 

I wanted to investigate the lady in the turquoise suit but my stop was coming up and I was utterly torn on what I should do. Did I interrupt my stakeout to figure out what was going on, or did I take the vision as instruction on what not to do? 

Eventually, I decided I was under contract and needed to head to the site. I would do some extra scanning, leave my phone to the side. I could still feel the embers as they tore me apart, shoving my body into the ground. I shivered. I tried shove down the notion that this was some sort of fate type situation. That the vision was just messing with me and this was cursed to happen. 

With shaking hands, I yanked the stop line and made my way to the front of the bus. I was going to try to change as much from my vision as I could and since I hopped out from the back last time, I slipped through a horde of passengers giving me an evil eye and spilled out onto the street. 

Lady in Turquoise waved to me familiarly, mouthing another set of words at me. I was able to make out the first half this time. 

“Four hundred and-“

That’s all I was able to make out before the bus pulled off, leaving me standing on the corner, conflicted. What do you do when you’re getting five hundred signs that something isn’t right, with no information on which part? I’m not sure what you good people would do, but I texted Eli, my supernatural supervisor. He’s who most of my jobs are setup through. I think he’s some kind of Paranormal middle management. I explained everything that had happened in one long-winded text, but received no response, and after ten minutes or so, decided to start my trek and figure it out on the way. 

As I walked, I scoured my brain for Fae information. Months ago, I’d been trapped in something called a Slamscroll, which is meant to send the user into a fantasy. My Slamscroll had been…less pleasant than a fantasy, but I’d at least remembered vaguely going into it. This time, there were no breaks in time, no inkling that I wasn’t in reality. Or at least the reality that I’m used to. I worried that I was laying in a room somewhere, bleeding out or hooked to machines. The grass felt real, the air was crisp. My bag was just as heavy as it always was, and I huffed and puffed my way up onto the ridge, covered in a thin layer of sweat. I chose a different spot this time, and laid my phone unlocked on the ground, casting wary glances at it every 10 seconds. Nothing wonky, just Jeri smiling playfully with pursed lips.

The phone read 6:45, and I opened my logbook to document my experience. I flipped to the first blank page, and started scribing in everything that had happened, when a drop of water fell onto the paper from the hanging brush. I scowled up at the offending leaf before wiping the drop away with my sleeve, smearing a bit of lead shavings lounging on the page. As I brushed the dampness from the page, it scrunched the paper, revealing the one behind it. I saw the top of the page below and cocked my head. It had the same date as today. Did I write the wrong date yesterday? I didn’t even remember taking any notes yesterday. I guess that’s the point of the notes, I thought, peeling the page back.

I froze, staring at the paper. The exact notes I’d just taken were scribbled down on the page. The same tool list, the same underlined sections, the same theories. I raked over the page, trying to piece together what was happening. It included notes I hadn’t even written yet. The page was burnt at the bottom, crispy black edges scraping against the pages on either side. The only difference between todays notes and yesterdays was the bottom, where it detailed the vision. Here, I’d written:

Had a vision on the bus. Sentient water blob fell from tree, ate/drowned me. Felt very real, unsure of source. Might have just been weird dream, but do not remember falling asleep.

I gaped at the page for a solid 30 seconds before flipping back. Next page back, same thing. This time I’d written:

Weird dream on bus. Eaten by mole monster. Weird sigils on stomach, Greek maybe? Felt like dream but don’t remember falling asleep.

It went on like this for hundreds of pages back. Fell into a hole that dumped me at the bottom of the ocean. Torn apart by ferrets. Shredded by literal Wolfman from the old black and white movies. Swallowed by air fish. Rapidly aged by Wizard. Live organ theft by 10 foot tall dentist using his own laughing gas. That one shook me. Dentists don’t need any help to be terrifying. 

I flipped anxiously from one page to the next, seeing the same scribblings on every single page, until finally I flipped to the very first page. It didn’t list anything about the vision but it did end raggedly, the pencil mark scraping downward into a broken dotted line, littered with dark red splotches. 

I was hyperventilating, kicking myself. How did I forget I had just started a brand new notebook? How did I not notice each time I had to flip further and further just to get to the next blank page? I briefly scanned through the rest of the pages, looking for any break in pattern. Nothing. Every day exactly the same and cutoff at the exact same point, the one exception being the variety of horrible deaths I’d dreamt. I started scouring each page, trying to find anything that lead me to an answer, when I heard a branch snap close by. 

I lifted my eyes from the page and finally began to hear the ragged breathing that had been ever so slowly creeping up on me. With my own ratted exhales, I had missed it until the hot, putrid breath pounded on the back of my neck. I didn’t even turn to look, I just popped up from my seat and took off, sprinting back the way I’d come down the hill. I made it three steps before an enormous yellow hook, meaty and ragged, snatched me around my midriff. It dug into my chest, tearing through my skin and jostling my ribs around. I heard a sick snap as one of my ribs snapped off and pierced through the skin of my abdomen. Pain exploded from my torso, my organs slipped around nervously, shoved out of their natural resting places. 

My entire body vibrated as what I could now recognize as a talon slammed me on the ground, slicing several more ribs through my skin. My vision phased in and out as the world spun and vicious pain splintered into my body, fighting for my attention. 

I stared fuzzily up at the creature, blood splurging painfully up my throat and leaking out of the corners of my mouth. I caught flashes of gold and blue, pieces of the enormous bird flashing in and out of visibility as it stared down at me curiously, cocking it’s enormous, plumed head side to side. It bent in a flash, snatching my left arm in it’s maw, flashing meaty ribbed gums and a sloppy razor lined tongue. I screamed, a nasty gurgling sound of misery as it wiggled playfully, steadily jerking my arm out of it’s socket. I stared down in disbelief, watching the meaty pieces of my arm disentangle from each other as it cocked it’s monolith head back, finally ripping my arm from my body with a menagerie of grisly snapping sounds. 

My vision started to fade to black as it bobbed up and down to slide it unceremoniously down it’s gullet. Blood was my entire world. I was covered in it. It fell sloppily out of the hole where my arm used to be, it bubbled out of my mouth and out of the slits speared by my own ribs out of my chest. I felt my heart start to slow as the creature returned it’s gaze to me. It bent again, slowly this time, making a rumbling chirping sound as it closed it’s beak around my other arm. Tears slid steadily out of my squinted eyes, mixing with the blood and ligament and bone and the saliva from my moaning mouth. I heard faint laughter, but could barely make it out, and the muscles that normally controlled my ability to turn my head were disconnected and laying next to me, probably draped over my phone. I stared up at the sky as the beast began tugging on my other arm, the tearing of my tendons cracking and snapping in my ear like a long car ride in the mountains. 

It swallowed as consciousness finally, mercifully, began slipping from me like a silk nightie, leaving me floating painlessly above my body. I felt nothing anymore. The ribs, the arms, the pain, the fear. All gone, faded to grey, far away from me. I was a sphere of light, without form, bobbing dreamily over the gore below. I had no arms to rip, no legs to hurt, no nerves to burn. But then I felt a strange sensation. It took me a moment to recognize what it was, having forgotten ever having a form in the first place. But after a few moments, it hit me. It was the feeling of my nose tingling. 

“Bless you!”

I looked up at the kid in disbelief. Tears streamed down my face and I let my bag fall limply off my shoulder onto the seat next to me. I wanted to be pissed, but all I could feel was a shaky, dizzying relief. I’m sure people were staring even harder than the first time, but I ignored them and pulled my bag towards me with shaking hands. I yanked the zipper on my bag and fished my notebook out of the pocket, flipping through it furiously. Same as before. Same notes, hundreds of pages filled in. 

In desperation, I flipped all the way to the back, the last page tucked against the back cover of the book. I snatched it over, scanning the back of the last page, and saw scrawled writing, not in pencil. Thick goopy lines in purple. A deep matte violet, the same color as the lady in Turquoise’s lipstick.

“TURQUOISE SISTER”

The blast went off to my left, and I scrambled over my bag to try to catch Lady in Red, but I was unprepared this time, and we both toppled down the stairs. I tried to take the brunt of the fall, angling myself towards the steps, earning me a sound bang of my head against the handrail. Tom, the behoodied teenage boy who’d helped Lady in Red the second go-round, shoved his foot under me as I fell, cushioning the blow against the hard metal floor. I groaned, shooting him a look of gratitude before achingly hauling myself off the floor, clumsily tugging Lady in Red up with me. 

As soon as I had her relatively stable in her seat, I marched up to Lady in Turquoise and crossed my arms. The shakiness had fallen off while catching Lady in Red and now pissed had finally shown up to the party. 

“Kill me for good or let me go,” I said, in what I thought was a very brave and unwavering voice, especially given I was seeing four to five tweety birds per second from my dazzling tumble moments before. 

She blinked up at me from golden lids before exploding in laughter. I couldn’t decide how to react, I just dropped my arms and stared at her like she was my high school bully and I’d just failed to land a comeback. My gaze flicked nervously to the other passengers, unsure of how many of them were in on it. Whatever it was. 

One delicate arm curved up to her face, checking the bejeweled watch adorning her wrist. 

“Oh, alright then,” she sighed, casually waving a hand in the air. 

My throat dried up.

“Okay, wait,” I began, “Let’s just-“ my words were cut short by a mad intensifying of the dizziness, until I swayed back and forth and toppled over towards the bus driver who’d angled around in his seat to catch the commotion. I think he said something like “whoa!” but it faded fast. All the sounds faded, and I collapsed into what felt like a wind tunnel. I fell faster and faster, pitch darkness surrounding me, until I saw a bead of light below me. I zoomed into the light, then through it into blackness again, catching a brief glance of the hill next to the server building as I passed. Another bead of light, coming towards me fast and I sunk through it, another chunk of hill flying past me. As I fell, the light moved faster and faster, until I was shooting through scenes of the hill every second. Flashes of the monstrosities I’d seen flew by me, and I finally focused enough to identify myself, in every situation. I dropped through water, fire, acid rain, through dozens of horrible, monstrous visions. I was shooting past all those dream deaths, I realized, but not in order. About halfway through by my estimation, I saw my final death, the macabre impersonation of Big Bird ripping my body apart like discount chicken. 

Flailing wildly and frantically trying to calculate how hard the impact of my fall would be when I finally stopped, I zipped past hundreds of gory scenes, catching glimpses of each of my horrible deaths. There was no possibility of counting at the speed I was falling, so I just freefell, watching the light fade from my eyes over and over again. At least when something didn’t eat them. 

I started spinning against my will, like an out of control merry go round, the intense light and sensation making me light-headed. The light was quickly fading, and I was grateful, honestly just hoping my nose didn’t tingle and start me all over again. I let myself fade, allowing unconsciousness to wrap around me like a balm. 

“Well, what do you think?”

I opened my eyes, flat on the ground of the little bundle of brush I’d squatted in the very first day of my stakeout. I stared at Lady in Turquoise as she stood over me, arms crossed, one foot tapping on the mudded ground below. 

“I’m so glad you didn’t say Bless You,” I said. 

She laughed, a musical tinkling sound, and reached a hand down towards me. As you can imagine, I was less than trusting of this hand, but I assumed she was some kind of Time God? Fae being? I wasn’t sure, but it was appearing like she’d chosen to let me go rather than kill me, and I wasn’t about to piss her off. 

I clutched her hand tentatively, rising from the ground, taking a physical inventory. Not burned, not broken, still breathing. Not in a bird stomach. 

“You may call me Melinda. I am Eli’s…I suppose your word for it would be Sister.”

“Oh, of fucking course,” I didn’t mean to say it, it just slipped out. I’d used up all my willpower in the previous 400 versions of this day I guess. 

She smiled a sly smile.

“Exactly,” she cooed. 

I looked up at her balefully from beneath my brows. 

“Okay. Melinda? It’s been a very. VERY. Long day. Can you please cut to whatever message or lesson this was supposed to be so I can actually do my job?”

I don’t know why I’m always getting snippy with monsters right after they’ve barely decided not to kill me. What’s wrong with me? I enjoy life, I think. At least the tacos part. 

“This is normal,” she said, brushing a stray hair back from her face and patting it into her neat bun, “Memories can be messy after The Light Show. Here.”

She took a step towards me and I flinched, eyes flicking nervously towards the hill for an escape route. She just cocked a brow. 

“Really?” she asked, a humoring smile on her face. 

I sighed, but stayed in place as she approached me. She grabbed the lobe of my left ear, yanking it sharply downwards. 

“Ow!” I yelled, smacking her hand away. I immediately regretted this decision, gazing up at her nervously, but she just smiled, a hand on her hip. 

A flash of pain ignited in my brain. My vision faded to black, and then started up again, and like a cutscene, I saw her and I standing in the same patch of shrubs. 

“Oh, uh, nice to meet you, Melinda,” I said. 

“Likewise, Lady Piper. Tell me, do you plan to work for my brother forever?”

“I mean, I’m kind of a consultant, so. I don’t really work for anyone, but I mean, he sends me interesting jobs. I like learning about all this weird stuff. No offense,” I finished quickly.

“None taken,” she’d smiled down at me, a calculating glint in her eye “So, you’re a scholar? You enjoy learning?”

“Oh, yeah!” I answered, clearly taking no time to consider the consequences of my words, “I study a different thing every week.”

“Would you like to know what your future with my brother may look like?”

This time, I took notice of her wording and returned a friendly smile. 

“Ah, no thanks. Future sight always comes with drawbacks. I can tuck and roll with the punches,” I laughed. 

“Hmm. Not even just a peek?” her voice was low, seductive and playful.

“Thanks, but I’ve made magic deals before and they always blow up in my face,” I started to change the subject, use this opportunity to get some answers about Eli and his whole deal, when she took a long, slow step towards me. 

I stuttered, realizing I might be in danger, and took a few cautious steps back, hands out. 

“I promise,” she cooed, “Nothing will blow up in your face. I’ve already seen them all, and that’s not one of them,” She smiled and her arm swung under her, “Catch.”

My utterly lost expression was replaced by alarm as I instinctually reached out and snatched the glowing orb she’d tossed me. My body shrunk, lit up, squeezed into the Orb like I was a Pokemon, and Melinda sat daintily against a tree, turning to admire the clouds floating across the sky. 

I dropped back into my real time body, stumbling into Melinda’s arms as she reached them out to catch me. I violently shrugged her off, taking a few unsteady steps backwards. 

“What is it with you people and trapping people inside stuff? Honestly, you could rip a tree apart with your bare hands, why send me to the fucking Negaverse?” before she had a chance to respond, I exploded again at the amused expression on her face, words spilling out of my mouth in frustration, “And you said it wouldn’t blow up in my face! Also, are you not Fae? Don’t you need, like, permission or something? You can’t just snatch people, Melinda!”

She waited for me to settle, heaving breaths puffing my chest up and down until finally collapsed onto the ground, tucking my knees between my hands and laying my sweaty brow on my kneecaps. 

“Melinda,” I said from the muffled pocket I’d made for myself, “Why does your family want me away from Eli? And what was all that? The Light Show? Does it only show the bad stuff? Is there no future where I don’t get gobbled up or burnt to a crisp or, I don’t know, drowned in a tree?” I raised my head, meeting her eyes as she paced towards me, hands behind her back. 

Her head was cocked in bemusement, regarding me with her whiskey eyes. Stepping leisurely around my lumped form, she squatted gracefully to my level, brushing stray wood chips from her vibrant suit skirt.

“You know, humans are unobservant. Most of your lore is folktale, passed down from the primal fear of fire, the dark, the unknown. You lot see a bear through the trees and name him bigfoot,” she laughed to herself. “But my…people…well, I was very impressed. You have a word for what we are. Close enough, anyways,” her smile was gentler than it had been before, and I began to unfurl from my centipede roll.

“What,” I hesitated, swallowing through a dry throat, “Uh, what are you?”

“What a question,” she mused, rising and turning to gaze out over the hills towards the city, “It was nice to meet you, Lady Piper.”

I moved to stop her, grill her for anything, a morsel of information. She turned her head to look back at me, piercing tawny eyes locked with mine.

“Eli,” Melinda continued, “What a unique name. I wonder why he chose it?” her gaze burned into mine meaningfully.

With that she hopped lightly and disappeared gracefully into the ground as though she were sliding into a pool of water. 

I stared dumbfounded for a moment and then decided I was entirely unsurprised by this turn of events. I scrambled up, snatching all my tools, and decided I would return the next day. I’d put my hours in for today and then some. I don’t get paid overtime.

I discovered later that the night I’d bailed on the stakeout, the server issue disappeared. The servers stayed on the whole night. Did Melinda mess with them just to draw me out? Why was it so important that it was here, why didn’t she just pop into my house and yank me into the orb? I was still pondering this when I finally made my way home that night. I splurged on an uber, I had had enough of the bus for one century.

Eli never got my long-winded SOS text. He was quite concerned to learn I’d met his sister, much more than when I’d had an also less-than-ideal meeting with his brother. I did ask him how many of his siblings would try to kill me before I got dental. 

I never got an answer, but when I got home, I found a pendant lying on my couch. It was gold with chunky amethyst and ruby highlights, jade crystals dancing from the outer rings. In the center, a dark blue eye, wide open and staring, speckled in gold and silver. Next to the amulet lay a page from my notebook, ripped raggedly from the spine. In that dark purple, that mad violet hue, was a collection of spiky ancient looking runes. A fat violet kiss print sat neatly to the side of it, above two words in English. 

“Call me.”
