Will anyone be surprised when I say that the holidays were hectic for us? 

For starters, on the days leading up to Christmas Eve, we always get Carolers. As their name implies, they go door to door bringing holiday cheer to all that make the mistake of answering the doorbell. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U) 

One way to differentiate them from the typical sorts of carolers is that the songs that they sing are much older. I'm not sure what the names of these funky fresh tunes are, but the words seem to be proto-Germanic in origin, according to recordings that were taken by our buddies in Ohio. Another way to tell is that no matter how long you stare at their faces, you can't quite make out any of their features, like you're viewing them through frosted glass. 

Something else that to note is that their numbers grow each time that they successfully get someone to listen to them sing. The moment the unfortunate listener becomes a part of the merry mob, their features become obscured like the others. And somehow, each member of this atypical choral group always knows the words to these ancient hymns despite having never heard them or the language they're spoken in before. 

Over the years, Orion has tried numerous ways to free those who've been absorbed by the Carolers, but nothing has worked, not even salt or iron. Restraining them only makes things worse; if they are taken too far away from the rest of the herd, they'll begin to bleed from the mouth and ears, resulting in damage to the victim's hearing and vocal chords. 

However, once the clock strikes midnight, the enchantment ends. The Carolers wander back to their homes in a stupor and wake up with no memory of what happened the previous night. They also tend to be sore, exhausted, and confused about why their voices have gone scratchy. 

Once someone becomes a part of the troupe, the best thing that Orion can do for them is follow the group while wearing noise-cancelling headphones to ensure that once midnight comes, the affected individuals get home safely. So far - at least in my time of being employed here - nobody has been taken permanently. 

It's a bizarre occurrence, to be sure, but as far as calls go, the Carolers are fairly non-threatening. The danger presented by them isn't from the Carolers themselves, but by what is attracted to them. 

This is a creature that hates all expressions of holiday cheer. It has been known to vandalize any decorations that it comes across; in extreme cases, it has broken into homes and businesses that offend it to forcibly remove everything within that reminds it of Christmas. Thankfully, the latter does not happen as often as the former. 

Considering how destructive this particular pest is, I’m thankful that it only emerges on Christmas Eve. That's when staying on the Carolers’ tails becomes crucial. On the night before Christmas, this task fell to Reyna and I. She noticed the threat before I did, pointing out the tall figure. 

It was covered in green fur, its yellow eyes shining in the darkness. The pest had also fashioned some semblance of a Santa Claus costume, though it wasn't cut evenly in some places and appeared to have been burned, at some point.

This is the pest that has dubbed itself the Mean One. 

Something else to note about it is that it is capable of communicating. We got the ‘Mean One’ from a letter it had left on a Christmas tree that it had incinerated two years back, written entirely in rhymes. The title is a bit goofy and not what I would've picked, but when these things provide one, it's generally best to use it to avoid insulting them. So, the ‘Mean One’ it is. 

Like I mentioned before, the Mean One mainly seems focused on property damage, but it has been known to attack humans occasionally. The boss told me about how it had clawed an extremely unfortunate mall Santa to the point of disfigurement before I started. The Mean One has also injured Carolers in the past, who are completely helpless while under their enchantment. It doesn’t appear to matter to the Mean One that the Carolers are singing songs that obviously predate modern day Christmas. 

The Mean One appeared to be grumbling to itself as it followed us, flexing and unflexing its elongated fingers. 

We couldn’t talk much with the sound-cancelling headphones on, so Reyna and I were reduced to communicating through gestures. I motioned for her to stay near the Carolers while I approached the Mean One. 

Even though the pest has a good understanding of English, as evidenced by that letter I mentioned, it's never been keen on speaking to us in the past. It was always possible that it could write in our language but not speak it. Couldn't hurt to try, though. See if I could dissuade it from hurting someone. 

As I got closer, I became acutely aware of how tall this thing was, looming insidiously over me. A pungent smell wafted off of the pest as well, making me suppress a gag. The odor could best be described as a hellish mixture of rotten tomatoes and ripe, expired old seafood.  

Once I was a safe distance away from the Carolers, I slid one of the headphone’s cups off of my right ear as I called out to the Mean One, “Excuse me, may I have a word?”

Its yellow eyes blazed as it growled, deep in its throat, “Do you expect me to speak to you while you carry that sword?”

Avoiding touching Ratcatcher’s hilt, I assured the Mean One, “I don't want trouble. The sword is just in case things get out of hand.”

“Put it down, that is a demand!” It snapped.

At first, I thought its way of speaking was outlandish until it occurred to me that it was *rhyming* with me. 

“I can't put it down unless I know that you won't harm the Carolers,” I explained using my ‘difficult customer’ voice. “They aren't in control of their actions. They can't help what they're doing. Please, just let them get through the night.”

The Mean One's green lip curled in a snarl, revealing that termites were squirming amongst its crooked, stained teeth, “You’ll put it down, unless you want a fight.”

Its absurdly long fingers flexed again. Through the lengthy fur, I couldn’t make out its claws, but I knew that they were there. That poor mall Santa could attest to that. 

“I'm going to reach for the hilt so that I can set it on the ground.” I explained to the Mean One slowly so that it wouldn't think I was moving to attack. 

Without making any sudden movements, I grasped Ratcatcher’s hilt, gingerly withdrawing the sword from its sheath, keeping it close by so that it would still be easy to reach in case shit hit the fan. The Mean One's eyes followed me distrustfully the entire time. 

“Now are you willing to talk-” I started to inquire just as the Mean One swiped a claw at me.

I staggered back, dropping to grab Ratcatcher before having to roll away from another slash. Fabric ripped, the back of my arm stinging as the Mean One nicked me. Grimacing against the pain, I retaliated, swinging the sword towards its chest. 

The pest was quick, but thankfully, nowhere near as fast or dexterous as my usual sparring opponents. It moved clumsily and without any sort of technique beyond trying to scratch me to death. Kind of like trying to fight a large, green, bipedal cat. 

After it left itself open with another vicious slash, I took advantage, giving the Mean One a neat little slice in its cheek. 

It blinked in disbelief, reaching up gingerly to touch the cut. Once it saw the blood on its fingertips, it turned tail and scurried away into the night, leaving me to stand there like an idiot in my confusion. 

That was it? That couldn’t be it. 

Apprehensive, I put my headphones back over my ears properly and rejoined Reyna on high alert. That *couldn’t* be it. The Mean One wouldn’t just give up after getting hit one time, would it? Most of the pests we deal with are pretty tenacious when it comes to punishing those that they believe to have caused them great offense, so I expected this one to be no different.

Until midnight finally came, Reyna and I waited for the Mean One to return and retaliate. It didn’t.

Through this encounter we’ve learned two things. The first is that it can speak, albeit in an obnoxious fashion. The second is that it’s cowardly when faced with direct confrontation. Good to know for the future.

On another note, our search for the Hunger Grass has been fruitless. 

We started off near where the Hungry Man was first spotted, figuring that he wouldn't stray too far from his home. It would be far more convenient if the cursed grass looked sinister, or at least instilled an off-putting feeling in those that passed by it, but part of why it's so dangerous is due to its ability to camouflage itself so well. 

When the use of hagstones didn't yield any results either, the idea was brought up to locate and follow the Hungry Man to see if that could lead us to the grass. However, Vic quickly shot it down, wisely reminding us that angering this Neighbor would have catastrophic consequences. 

After a couple more days of futile searching, I decided it was time to bite the bullet and ask the banjo bastard about it. 

What truly sucks is he actually gave me the three nights preceding Christmas off from training. And instead of enjoying one of them, I was making the trek through the woods towards the skull trees with an offering in hand. This time, it was a coyote's skull. One of the local hunters had it for sale at a flea market, along with some incredible deer jerky. 

Like last time, I made his offering festive, wrapping the skull in colorful paper decorated with little cartoon reindeer. Unfortunately, I ran out of it part way through and ended up needing to haphazardly tape a square with a completely different pattern on it to cover the whole thing. I slapped a ribbon on top of the monstrosity to try to improve its appearance, but this addition only made it look even more like it had been wrapped by a five-year-old. 

I found Iolo at the skull trees, sporting a Santa hat. He sat in front of the fire, eyes shut contentedly as the logs crackled. Psychopath even decorated a few of the trees, hanging ornaments off of exposed rib cages and weaving string lights through empty eye sockets. 

Without looking at me, he greeted me very kindly, “Thought I told you to fuck off for the evenin'?”

I ignored him, too preoccupied with his disturbing display of Yuletide cheer, “Aren't you worried about someone seeing this?”

“No, not particularly,” The mechanic replied with a smile, opening one eye. “I'm always lookin’ to add more to my collection.”

*Christ.* Good thing his clearing is pretty deep in the woods. 

“I don't think some last minute decorations are going to put you on Santa's nice list.” I told him. 

“Oh, this?” He raised his eyebrows. “This ain't for him. We got a little gatherin’ goin' on, so whatever you're here for, you best make it quick.”

Not wanting to risk the possibility of being the Wild Hunt's entertainment for their little hangout, I presented the offering to Iolo. 

When he saw the catastrophic wrapping job, he snorted, “You wrap this in the dark, Fiona?”

“It’s what's inside that counts.” I reminded him. “This offering is in exchange for information, if you accept it.”

“About?”

“There is Hunger Grass growing in this area and I need to know where.”

Iolo tore the paper off, giving the coyote skull an approving nod and a *‘hm!’* He then rose from his seat to set it on top of the tree containing the remains of the two, ill-fated monster hunters he'd punished for harassing the Neighbors in our operating area, placing it on what was left of the one's skull. 

Seeming not to care about how horrified I was by this grotesque display, Iolo came to stand in front of me, asking, “What makes you think I'd know anythin’ ‘bout that?”

“I don't.” I replied honestly. “But given that you have eyes and ears everywhere, I figured you'd be a good place to start.”

The mechanic crossed his arms, his eyes slitting as if he was searching my face for something, “I mighta heard somethin’. What do ya plan on doin’ once you find it?”

While researching the Hunger Grass, we've found that there are a few potential methods to dispel the curse. One way is to sprinkle bread crumbs over the affected area; allegedly, this will free those who've come into contact with it as well as clear up the infestation. The grass can also be burnt, but there is nothing in the records we found that states exactly how this treatment method will affect those suffering from its effects. 

Once we find it, the plan is to try the bread crumbs, then if that doesn't work, burn it up. Seemed solid enough to me. 

However, when I explained all of this to Iolo, that apparently wasn't the answer he'd wanted, “Ain't you curious ‘bout why it showed up in the first place?”

“Of course,” I told him. “We just need to stop the grass and those who are connected to it from hurting anyone else first. We've already had one incident and for all we know, there could be more that no one has alerted us to.”

The corner of the mechanic’s mouth lifted, “So what exactly are you wantin' outta this? Need one of us to show you where it is or are you just lookin’ for information? Offerin'll only get ya one or the other.”

Both would be valuable, especially since there was clearly something to the ‘why’ of it that he was keeping to himself. 

“Why be coy?” I challenged him. “There's obviously something you want to say.”

His eyes narrowed, “You ain't new here, Fiona. The rules don't suddenly change just ‘cause we're tryin’ to play nice with one another. Now, unless you wanna owe me a favor, you'll pick one.”

I weighed the two options. Getting rid of it as soon as possible was top priority, but knowing how it started could give us a better idea of what caused the growth in the first place. Sure, we'd get rid of one patch, but another could spring up elsewhere, especially if a vindictive Neighbor is responsible for it. Getting rid of this section could potentially only be a band-aid solution. 

In the end, I decided, “For now, I'm going to say that being led to the grass would be the most useful thing. But I do want you to know that I'll bring you another offering for any other information you may have on it later on.”

Iolo shrugged one shoulder, “Alrighty. Just know it ain't happenin' tonight. If you wanted instant service, you coulda brought me one from a human. Imagine ol’ blue eyes would have one floatin’ around.”

“Tomorrow then.” I said, ignoring his final comment, knowing it was intended to get under my skin. “In the morning, if that works. If not, then the day after Yule.”

He let out a laugh, eyebrows furrowed as if I’d said something profane, “So we're on your time, now?” 

“My intention wasn't to insult you,” I replied calmly, hoping to avoid becoming the piñata for his Christmas party. “I was just trying to find a good time to do it and didn't phrase it very well.”

His smile would have looked friendly to the untrained eye, “Maybe you should join us tonight. Since we're on such casual terms, and all.”

*Oh, shit.*

To my credit, I remained completely composed, “I appreciate the invitation, but sadly, I have to decline.” 

“Wasn't askin’.” His curt reply made my mouth go dry. 

I knew better than to keep pushing. *Fuck.* 

Resigned, I sighed, “Okay. What am I in for?”

“We got someone special comin’ tonight.” He told me vaguely. “Do as you’re told, don't ask questions, don't be annoyin’. Think you can handle that?”

Naturally, that cleared nothing up. 

However, I didn't have the chance to pester him about it: there were footsteps approaching. Imagine my surprise when Victor was the one who was illuminated by the firelight, looking equally as baffled to see me as I was to see him. 

“What are you doing here?” He demanded. 

I balked, “Me? What are *you* doing here?” 

“I invited him,” Iolo interjected nonchalantly. “Got a little ceremony that he's gonna want to be a part of.”

What was that supposed to mean? 

Victor then quietly started to inform me, “The Gray Mare is coming.”

Before he could elaborate further, we were interrupted by the sound of bells jingling. I turned to see one of the Cŵn Annwn bounding through the woods, wearing a collar covered with red and green bells as well as an antler headband. 

“I meant to be here sooner,” The Houndmaster's voice preceded her appearance. “But *someone* was being disagreeable about the collar.”

The hound looked around innocently with its red ears back as if to say, ‘Who? Me?’

Iolo stared down at the dog curiously as he took his seat back, “Surprised she ain't rip ‘em off yet.”

“Give her time.” The Houndmaster said with a long-suffering sigh. 

Now that she was close, I could see that she was wearing a matching pair of fake antlers, also covered in little bells, as well as a kitschy green sweater covered in tinsel and tassels shaped like Christmas trees. The get up contrasted with her usual no-nonsense demeanor to the point of being comical. 

*Am I dreaming?* Judging by the barely concealed look of puzzlement drawing Victor's eyebrows together, he was feeling the same way as I was. The hound settled down next to us, its floppy ears pointed forward as if listening for something. 

The surreal quality of the evening only increased when Briar arrived. At first, I’d thought he’d Scrooged out until I saw the gold tinsel he’d woven into a few accent braids in his wavy hair. He’d even found a small red ornament to wear as an earring, standing out against the plain pewter of the rest of his piercings. 

Victor noticeably stiffened when he saw the thorned Huntsman, pointedly avoiding eye contact. What was that about?

“Our guest of honor is on her way,” Briar announced, promptly sitting in Iolo's lap and wrapping his arm around the captain of the Wild Hunt's shoulders. “Did Redneck Santa bring me anything?”

*What the hell is going on?*

Not phased in the slightest, Iolo nodded towards us, “Got some volunteers. And some Christmas spirit.”

He handed Briar a flask that he’d produced from his inside coat pocket, then told his colleague to get off before their combined weight broke the chair. He then playfully kicked the thorned Hunter in the rear as he strode towards the Houndmaster. 

*This **has** to be a dream.*

“Volunteers for *what?*” I inquired, trying not to sound impatient. 

“The Mare requires an escort.” The Houndmaster explained, looking me up and down as if just noticing me. “Though, I wasn't expecting you to be a part of it.”

*Yeah, you and me both.*

The mechanic flashed a grin, “She wasn't, ‘til she opened her fuckin' mouth.”

At that, Victor gave me The Glare. All of the defenses that my mind could summon were fairly weak. In retrospect, I think Iolo was looking for some sort of excuse to trap me with him for the evening, and my dumb ass served it up to him on a silver platter. 

There was the stomping of hooves along with the sound of more bells jingling before I saw the mechanic’s ‘special guest.’ 

At first, I thought the being sauntering towards us was wearing a horse's skull as a mask, but then I quickly realized that it was the Mare's head. It was difficult to make out the shape of the rest of her body under the billowing white sheet she wore, though it appeared she was bipedal, judging by her gait. Round ornaments, one red and one green, shone from the skull's empty sockets in the place of eyes. Matching ribbons danced from the top of the being's head in the breeze. Dangling beneath her jaw was a set of reins, covered in red, green, and gold jingle bells. 

“Season's greetings,” The Mare crowed in a voice that reminded me of the wind howling through bare branches during a snowstorm. “And merry meetings!”

Iolo emerged from his seat to welcome the ominous newcomer. They exchanged words in what sounded like Welsh, and at one point, he smirked toward us. I didn't trust that expression. Not one bit. 

Once their discussion concluded, Iolo's attention shifted towards Victor, “You know the tradition, blue eyes?”

The boss confirmed that he did. That made one of us. 

The mechanic smiled. “Then it'll fall on you to fill the Mari Lwyd's hosts in.”

“Can somebody please explain to me-” I started to ask when a mask appeared in my face, its empty eyes revealing that the one holding it was the Houndmaster. 

She had donned a white one, accented with gold swirls along its forehead and cheeks. 

“You'll want this, unless you're fine with the homeowners recognizing you.” She said, only increasing my discombobulation. 

Losing my patience, I questioned, “Are we robbing people? What is this?”

That earned a snicker from Briar, who'd adopted a black mask featuring a long nose and intimidating snarl. He approached the boss, getting far closer than needed to give him a mask that reminded me of Krampus with its fangs and curved horns. 

The Mare was the one that answered in her terrible voice, “From house to house, we will eat, drink, and be merry. Dampen that frown, for there is no need to be wary.”

In case I haven't made it clear, I'm really, *really* sick of rhymes. And I couldn't help but notice that nobody had outright said that we weren't breaking and entering into any homes. Through the glaring eyes of his silver mask that bore a wide, wicked grin, Iolo's impatient gaze looked more menacing than usual.

With numb, reluctant fingers, I accepted the disguise being offered to me. A clown. Fitting. But also, *fuck them.* 

Once all of our faces were covered, Iolo gave the Mare a deep bow before taking her reins in one hand. The sheet covering her body undulated in a ghostly manner, revealing a nauseating tangle of bone, hooves, and humanoid feet beneath it. Unnerved, I tore my gaze away from the Mare, following the Hunters and their equine guest. Meanwhile, the hound trotted along next to us, obediently staying near its master.

Along the way, Victor hurriedly explained the tradition that he and I were being roped into. Iolo was acting as the Mare's leader, taking on the responsibility of guiding her from house to house. Those that answered when the Mare knocked had to participate in a battle of song and - you guessed it - rhymes. If the homeowners gave up or failed to think of a proper rebuttal in time, they'd be forced to let the Mare in. 

That prompted me to ask, “What happens when the Mare goes in?” 

“It eats,” He responded, also clearly on edge. “To what end, I'm not sure yet. But the homeowners will be expected to provide a feast of whatever they have available.”

“So we really *are* burglarizing people.” I muttered in disbelief.

Briar helpfully called over his shoulder, “We're burglarizing them *festively.*”

Victor ignored him, “According to what I've heard, the Mare does grant blessings to whoever allows her and her escorts in. We just have to hope that whoever the mechanic chooses will be willing to play along.”

Given how well the clients in our operating area listen when there *isn't* a skeletal horse accompanied by an entourage clad in intimidating masks, that didn't bode well. For example: every Housekeeper case that has been documented on this Reddit account. 

To my chagrin, we were approaching the suburbs. Call me judgmental if you want, but I've had far too many negative experiences with the residents of the cul-de-sac we were wandering into. 

The first house we approached was one of the biggest ones on the block, complete with a two car garage. That may not sound luxurious to some, but for this area, that's just one garage away from being a McMansion. An elaborate chandelier was visible in a massive, round window above the door. 

*Yeah, we're definitely getting sued if these people figure out who we are.*

I was glad that I'd picked that night to not wear my company jacket. Victor had done the same. Just had to hope no one recognized our voices or unmasked us.

Iolo knocked for the Mare. That was Victor's cue to move up front. Already, I was tempted to burrow into a hole in the dirt like a groundhog to escape this incredibly uncomfortable situation. 

The door opened a crack, only for it to slam shut as the person who'd opened it screamed. A completely reasonable reaction, I’d say. 

Iolo simply shrugged, half turning to announce a little too cheerfully, “Alright, next house!”

This was ridiculous. There was no way that anyone would answer the door for our little nightmare procession, let alone engage in a rhyming battle of wits as the only way to keep us from gaining entry. But that begged the question of what would happen if the Mare spent the night unsatisfied. Would we or any of those that denied her be punished? Would we have to resort to forcing our way in, or did we have to be invited? Did the feast matter more or the ritual? 

There was a cacophony of jingling as the Mare suddenly wrenched her reins out of Iolo's grasp, the ornaments in her empty sockets reflecting the Christmas lights around us as she faced me. 

I froze as the Mare spoke to me, “Were you not warned of what lies ahead? Recall your meeting with the starving dead.”

My throat tightened from the directness of her confrontation. 

“Famine is on the horizon.” I told her, then quickly added. “For every father and son.”

Not a good rhyme by any means, but considering that I'd already unintentionally provoked the Mare with my doubts, I didn't want to take the chance of angering her further. 

As she crept closer, hooves echoing loudly against the pavement, the air felt heavy as she responded, “There are some that can be spared. They need only to answer their door and offer their fair share.”

So this was some attempt at aid? Vic had said that this ominous being was known to reward those who participated in this ritual. I wasn't sure if the Mare was capable of lying, and nothing I’ve found in regards to her has stated if she is bound to the same rules as the Neighbors. However, with the Mare's bony snout within arm's reach, all notions of questioning her died as I became acutely aware of how big her teeth were. 

“The old ways have been forgotten,” The Mare continued, her decorations jingling in a way that seemed to punctuate her words. “In their place, new traditions were begotten. The old will feel no sympathy for the young as they are similarly usurped and replaced. If you wish to delay that moment, young one, then we must make haste.”

The Mare then silently gauged me after she finished saying her piece. I couldn't tell if she wanted me to respond. Not wanting to have to think of another rhyme, I simply nodded. That seemed to have satisfied her as she swiveled back towards Iolo in a flurry of ribbons and white cloth. Meanwhile, I could feel the Huntsman's glare scathing me. As far as he was concerned, I'd just disobeyed his order to simply do as I was told without questioning anything.

From where I stayed at the back of the group, I faintly heard Victor tell the mechanic that he had an idea. Not long afterwards, the boss summoned me. 

“Since you and the Houndmaster look the least intimidating of everyone here, you two will go to the next house first. Tell the homeowner it's an event sponsored by the trustees, if you have to. I know one of them, so hopefully, I can get him on board tomorrow. If the homeowners are open to it, I'll explain the rules to them from there.” Victor told me. 

While he was relaying this to me, something caught my eye. There were thin little cuts on his wrist. Their imprint in his gray skin was easily recognizable as being from Briar’s thorns. When did that happen? They looked fresh. 

Sounding as if he was smiling, Iolo chimed in, “And before you argue, Fiona, you and ol' blue eyes here are the only ones that can lie. Gotta be one o' you and since your boss here has all the charm of a corpse, it'd be best if he just kept his mouth shut.”

Subtly, I heard a soft scoff behind Victor's Krampus mask, but Iolo seemed much more invested in making me miserable than him. 

“You tell me I'm annoying every five minutes.” I pointed out. 

“Well, that's because you are.” He said matter-of-factly. Prick. “But you're annoyin’ in a way that makes you endearin’, so just do your usual bullshit and get us in there, alright?”

The Mare’s head turned so that it was facing backwards towards me. With her watching me, I didn't dare denounce this plan or go against it. Once I'd agreed to it without causing any trouble, she gradually turned to face forward again. My skin crawled afterwards, making the unseasonably warm night suddenly feel about ten degrees cooler. 

The hound bounded ahead of its master as she and I flounced towards the next house. The dog then sat attentively in front of the door, tail wagging adorably. 

With a deep breath to steel myself, I rang the doorbell. 

“We best make this work,” The Houndmaster muttered to me. “The Mare's time on the surface is limited. Wouldn't want her to lose patience.”

That definitely didn’t sound good. I didn't get a chance to reply as the homeowners answered. While one of the men immediately began fawning over the hound in its festive little collar and antlers, his partner watched the Huntress and I apprehensively.

“Can we help you?” He asked slowly as if unsure if he wanted to hear our answer.  

“Uh,” I began brilliantly. “I know this looks a bit strange, but we're actually doing a cultural reenactment for you tonight, if you’re willing to participate.”

I went a little off the plan, but at least I saved Vic from having to call that trustee.

The man who'd been enamored with the hound rose up to say, “Oh, really? What culture?”

“Welsh.” The Houndmaster supplied politely, saving me from having to stammer more. “This tradition is said to bring good luck to those who participate.”

“Oh, we could use some of that, couldn't we, babe?” The dog lover chirped, playfully slapping the other man on the chest. 

To which his partner replied, “Yeah, no more eggnog for you.”

“So, you want to try it out?” I prodded, trying to sound cheery, hoping it didn't come off as too artificial. 

The dog lover threw a hand in the air, “Why not? It could be fun!”

*Oh boy, here we go.*

That was Victor's cue to explain the rules. The dog lover's partner made a quip about how he was going to need more ‘holiday spirit’ for this, but otherwise, the two men seemed on board once they briefly stepped back inside to refill their eggnog. For their sake, I prayed that I hadn't just coerced them into something horrible. 

With that out of the way, the battle of wits had begun. 

Some of yinz may want to know what all was said, but frankly, I'm so *so* sick of rhymes and don't want to transcribe more than I have to, especially since the homeowners and the Mare went back and forth for a good while. In a shocking turn of events, it seemed like both parties were actually having fun. Every once in a while, one of the Hunters would retort instead of the skeletal horse. And to his credit, the dog lover was much better at thinking up rhymes than I was, even while tipsy. 

Over time, both groups devolved from clever, well-thought out barbs to lines such as, *“I'll fuck your dad and your mom, you damned peeping Tom!”*

I'll let yinz guess which Hunter was responsible for that gem. 

In the end, the homeowners lost. My heart sank when I saw the two men look at each other, cackling uproariously as they both failed to come up with a word that rhymes with ‘tomfoolery.’ 

“So, do we uh, really have to invite you in, now?” The partner asked, nowhere near as nervous as he probably should have been. 

Iolo shrugged as if it were no big deal, “Yup, that's the tradition.”

“Ah, okay. That was pretty fun, so I guess a few minutes wouldn't hurt.”

The Mare took off, tearing the reins from Iolo's grip. Startled by her sudden movement, the homeowners jumped back, the dog lover letting out a shaky, nervous laugh as she made a beeline towards their dining room. The Hunters merely filed in after her, leaving the homeowners aghast. The hound had even begun sniffing around once it crossed the threshold. Hesitantly, Victor and I followed suit.

“Someone's, uh… excited!” The dog lover joked anxiously, eyes huge as the Mare stuck her face in their bowl of eggnog like a pig drinking from a trough. 

It was a strange spectacle to witness. I'd expected it to dribble from her exposed mandible and onto the floor, but each gulp disappeared behind her snapping jaws. She even managed not to get a single drop on her white sheet. Iolo merely observed the Mare's gluttony with his arms folded over his chest. Noticing that some mistletoe hung on the other side of the room, I avoided it (and him) like they both were carriers of the Bubonic plague.

To my horror, Briar took out his flask, presenting it to the couple as he asked if they had any aversions to Jameson. Just as I stepped forward to warn them, I felt something catch my belt loop, keeping me in place. I turned to see Iolo’s grinning mask and Santa hat.

He chided me, “You ever consider relaxin' for once in your life?” 

“I know what happens when yinz offer food or drinks to mortals.” I argued.  “Now let me-”

“It’s just whiskey, offered freely in the spirit o’ the season.” He replied aloofly. “The rules are a bit different tonight, seein' as we ain't seekin' to take anyone. I'll tell ya again, Fiona. *Relax.* You might even have some fun, for once.”

Similarly, Victor had needed to be stopped from interfering by the Houndmaster. He'd been about to shout to get their attention until she squeezed his arm hard enough to silence him. 

“I can't. I know you too well.” I retorted. 

His eyes narrowed, stepping between me and our unwitting hosts before I could make another break for it, close enough to quietly argue, “You know damn well I can't lie. That whiskey ain't from our world. It won't change ‘em or hurt ‘em. Now, this is *twice* that you’ve had to be corrected, once from our guest, the other from me. Don't make me do it a third time.”

All I could do was watch as the homeowners shared liquor with the Huntsman, blissfully unaware of the danger that they were in. Once the shot made it down their throats, I expected to see something terrible happen. For them to melt into easily moldable parts for the Hunters to rearrange. Instead, they kept laughing and joking with Briar while occasionally sneaking worried glances towards the Mare. By this point, she'd moved on to a plate of brightly decorated Christmas cookies. 

“See? Nothin' happened.” Iolo sneered. 

With how thin his patience was that night, I wasn't certain if questioning him or trying to bicker further would be wise. 

I did my best to keep the strain out of my voice as I responded, “Okay. I was just worried for their well-being, especially since the Mare wants to grant them a blessing. It might help if I know what your intentions are.”

His glare didn't soften any. “Simple. Escort our esteemed guest, show her a good time, and at some point, get a nice buzz goin’. That good enough for ya?”

“I appreciate you being transparent.” I said evenly despite the bite of his tone. 

I had to resist the urge to roll my eyes when he scoffed, “Yeah, you better.”

The Mare eventually got her fill, but there wasn't much left. I watched with bated breath as the dog lover consumed one of the few Christmas cookies left behind. He seemed to be able to taste it. That helped ease my nerves some. 

On our way out, the Mare bowed her skeletal head to them, “In the upcoming trials and tribulations, you will be granted salvation.”

The couple awkwardly thanked her, the dog lover’s partner even giving her a timid little wave. I could imagine that the pair were more confused than they’d ever been in their lives, but hopefully, whatever blessings have been granted to them will be worth that one uncomfortable evening. 

We followed the same strategy with the rest of houses with varying success, but more than what we had before prior to Victor’s suggestion. The idea of the Hunters offering our unsuspecting hosts drinks still didn’t sit right with me, but there was little that could be done about it. 

Some of the people we visited seemed to enjoy the Mare’s visit while others appeared to be humoring us, though whether it was out of politeness or fear, I wasn’t sure. After a while, I lost track of how many doors we stopped at and just shut my brain off, ready to come home and ideally not hear any more rhymes for the rest of my life. 

By the time we were finally done, Briar’s flask was completely empty and the thorny boi was clearly feeling pretty good. He kept finding excuses to speak to the boss as we headed back towards the skull trees, occasionally bumping into Victor or touching his arm. Victor simply stared straight ahead, only speaking when spoken to. Along with that, the Houndmaster had started to loosen up a bit, and through what could best be described as a Christmas miracle, Iolo had removed the bug that had crawled up his ass earlier and was actually being somewhat pleasant. 

As we got closer to the clearing, the Hunters removed their masks, indicating that it was fine for us to do the same. The fresh air was welcome after hours of having that hard plastic on my face. 

The Mare stopped to stand before the fire, the ornaments that served as her eyes glimmering as she faced the boss and me, “Go forth, for your duty has been done. From now until the end of days, I will not forget the generosity of Orion.”

She didn’t have to tell me twice. I gave her a polite bow, unsure if that was the proper way to bid her goodbye, but she seemed to accept it. Victor did the same. It didn’t escape my notice that Briar watched him with unabashed intensity as we departed. 

Once we were far enough away to be out of earshot, I cautiously inquired, “Did you get into a fight with Briar earlier?”

He’d been deep in thought when I questioned him, shaking his head as if just remembering that I was capable of speech. “What? No. Why?”

I nodded towards him, “Those marks on your wrist. I’ve had them before.”

Judging by his reaction to the cuts, he hadn’t realized that they were there. But how could he not? Speaking as someone who’s had her blood drawn by those thorns more times than I care to acknowledge, it hurts like hell. Without a word, he covered the shallow wounds up with his sleeve.

Concerned, I kept pressing him, “Are you alright?”

For a long time, the boss remained silent. When he finally spoke, he hesitantly admitted, “Briar got me under the mistletoe earlier. Before I got to the mechanic’s clearing.”

Eyebrows raised, I gaped at him. I’d known Briar had an interest in him, but I hadn’t realized that it had gotten to that point.  

As someone who’s been on the receiving end of a Huntsman’s unwanted affections, I gently asked him, “Seriously, are you alright?”

“I don’t want to get into details, so I’ll just say that I’m still trying to figure out how I feel about it.” Victor responded, his expression giving nothing away. “But right now, I’m leaning towards some variation of, *‘Oh shit.’*” 

Oh shit, indeed. I invited him over to hang out and maybe get his mind off of things. He declined, but was grateful for the offer. Understandably, he wanted his solitude, though he swore to call me if he needed me. 

In other news, I’m pleased to report that Christmas day was peaceful. Just a nice, wholesome dinner with my mom and Deirdre, though Mom did do me dirty by breaking out some old video tapes that she'd taken of me as a preteen. I refuse to say what was on them. Just know that they will be [destroyed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/SO6b77lmMD)
