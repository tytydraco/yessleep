I first noticed it three weeks ago.

I spent the evening in my room studying. The sun had already set by 6pm and since my shitty little desk lamp died a day ago, I had to rely on the clinically white ceiling lamp. Not only does it make the room look and feel like an operating theatre, it also makes me throw a shadow on my workbook no matter how I twist and turn. Not really boosting my motivation for mathematics, that's for sure. 

So I did what I should have done hours ago, I gave up on learning, turned off the lights and let myself fall onto the bed. The former operating theatre now resembled an eerie cave. I hate how soon it gets dark in the winter.

The blackness was only broken by the glow of the street lights, shining through my second story window. I couldn't stand them when we moved here a year ago but I kinda grew to like them with time. The dull yellow light surely feels more comfortable than bright white.

But that day, something about them felt different. I rolled over on my bed, to face the window. There was something off about the lantern, but I couldn't make it out. After a while I dismissed it and eventually forgot about it. 

Days passed until I finally noticed what it was that had changed. The lantern was glowing in a different hue.

It was barely noticeable. The light just looked a little bit more orange today compared to the yellow I grew accustomed to. Maybe that's a sign of the bulb slowly dying? Or maybe I just made it up in my head. I chose to ignore it, but I couldn't quite get it out of my mind. 

Days later it became undeniable. The light was bright orange, almost had a red tone to it. I leaned out of the window to get a better look at the rest of the lanterns along the street. They all had the same colour.

Did someone switch the bulbs during the day to drive me mad? No, they have been changing for the past days, that wouldn't make sense. Then why was this happening? And why did I even care so much? It's just stupid street lamps!

I had more important things to wrap my head around than the colour of the lanterns. School, projects, friends. But no matter what I tried, my confusion about them always resurfaced in the end. 

Two days later, the light was deep red. Uncomfortable to look at. The longer I stared at it, the more I felt something staring back. 

That can't be normal. Lightbulbs don't do such things on their own. By that time I couldn't focus on anything else anymore. If this was a prank, I have to admit, it was a creative one. 

But it wasn't a prank. Whatever it was, it felt deadly serious. It was a threat more than anything.

I spent most evenings sitting at my desk, observing the light. I know, I should have maybe talked about it with my parents instead of secretly obsessing over it, but that thought hadn't crossed my mind.

The way the red light flooded my room. The way the lanterns stood there, just at my eye level, staring through my window. It felt too personal to share. Like its burning red rage was only met for me and me alone. 

Then I noticed the girl. She was maybe thirteen, walking down the street with her backpack on. I had seen her before somewhere. I think she was a neighbour's daughter.

I watched her calmly walk down the street, passing through the cones of eerie red light. One by one, until she crossed the lantern opposite my window.

As soon as she was fully engulfed in the light, the lantern started flickering. A moment of complete darkness. And as the light turned on again, the girl was gone. 

I jumped back from my table. Had I just whitenessed a child dissolve into thin air? I crawled back towards the window, frantically looking the street up and down. My heart was racing. I told myself, she must have just been running away without me noticing. There must have been an explanation but I couldn't think of any.

The longer I kept looking for her, the more frustrated I got. There was no way I could find her just by staring out the window. So I rushed down the stairs and out of the house.

My legs came to a halt as I reached the tarmac. 

The street light, it was so much more threatening up close. They only ever activated after I was already home. I hadn't been outside after sunset since the lanterns turned red. It felt surreal.

There was a presence. A pressure in the air. It wasn't just red light, there was something else hiding in those cones. 

My instincts told me to run, so I did. I hid in my room, closed the blinds and forced myself to sleep.

The next day I tried to convince myself it had just been a dream. It must have been. I almost believed it too, until Monica's parents knocked on our door.

My dad opened the door and talked to them. I listened to their conversation from the staircase. The couple sounded devastated. They've been asking every house in the street if anyone had seen their daughter. 

My dad invited them in but they said they had no time, they had to continue searching. My heart broke for them. I thought about telling them what I saw the evening prior, but they wouldn't have believed me anyway. It would have only made me sound suspicious.

Coming to terms with the reality of it wasn't easy. I felt so guilty for not telling that family what I saw. But more than that, I just had to find out what was going on with the damn street lights. I observed them. Waited. Thought about every option and, in my mindless obsession, came to only one conclusion.

I went outside again that evening.

The lantern seemed to glow a little brighter this time. More intense. Hungrier than before.

I held out my hand as I walked closer to the red beam. As if approaching a wild animal. I paused for a moment before I let my hand touch the light. I felt nothing.

I expected it to be warm, to burn me, hurt me, entice me to come closer. It did nothing of that sort. I stepped inside.

The world around me was covered in a translucent red coat, as was I. I looked up. The lantern stared back at me with its singular red glowing eye. Like a predator, ready to pounce.

Suddenly all the street lights went out. All but the one above me. I shook. Started frantically looking around. I had become too careless. I realised that now.

Then a lantern started to shine. One further down the street. All the other ones between mine and this one were pitch black. All of a sudden I felt safer standing in the light than outside.

Until my lantern started to flicker as well. I drew a sharp breath as my eyes darted upwards. I saw that girl in my mind, Monica. I couldn't end up like her.

So I started sprinting towards the other lantern. My legs carried me as fast as they could. I felt as if a thousand hungry eyes watched my every move. I hadn't felt as frightened by the dark since I was a little kid. 

After a terrifying sprint I reached the next red light cone. It took a moment for me to catch my breath. My lungs were burning from inhaling the cold winter air. As I caught myself again I already saw it. The next lantern, about as far away as I now stood from my house. As the light above me began to flicker, I began to run. 

I felt so helpless, chased around by streetlights. But there was no other way than forward. 

As I arrived I had already seen the next lantern turn on. Taunting me. 

I kept running. My lungs burning. My feet barely touching the ground. Until I noticed them change again. The light was looking more orange under the lantern ahead of me. Maybe I was moving in the right direction after all.

I kept running from one light cone to the next as the colour changed more and more to what I had known. 

As I reached a dull yellow glowing street light, I couldn't help but fall on my knees. There was no new lantern flicking on at the end of the street. Instead, they all began shining at the same time. All in a familiar yellow hue. All as they should be. 

There were no eyes staring at me anymore, no tormenting pressure in the air. I was free, and better yet, I was home. My marathon had led me to exactly the lantern I started at. I was kneeling in front of my own driveway. 

The lanterns haven't changed since. They are back to the normal dull yellow I knew and loved. Monica wasn't found though. I still think about her all the time.

I know now how crazy I was for obsessing over the lanterns like that. I must have spent hours just looking into that red light. The intense red must have burned itself into my eyes, because now everything I see just looks a little too green in comparison.
