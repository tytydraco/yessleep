This should probably go on /x/ but what the hell.
I've seen Shadow People, the usual white/black flashes and the like but here three things I've seen and can explain.
Please if you have any explanation other than hallucinations and schizophrenia please post it. I don't have the money for the therapy I know I need, so this will have to do.

I was walking down a hallway in my house, this hallway has a door that leads to behind the house that we usually put a curtain over. I remember a thin, pale, clawed hand reaching out from under it. The hand grabbed my ankle a I remember trying to shake it off, but being unable to. Strangely the memory ends there I have no clued what happened after than. The memory also has no sound, like, I don't remember hearing anything during this nor what the hand's grip felt like.

I once saw a "demon" like thing out my window. It was that same thin, pale white as the hand. It's arms were two different lengths, it had no ears or nose it had six slits where it's eyes would be, and a large slit where a mouth would be. It also had two big wings coming out of it's back. It disappeared shortly after I saw it, but I'll never forget it's stare. A cold stare that seemed a mixture of unfeeling blankness and mild amusement.

If any of y'all have ever played Legacy Edition Minecraft (PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii), you know it's better than both Java and Bedrock. Even though it stopped updating at 1.13 it's still the best, it's a perfect blend of Java and Bedrock. But I have a weird mandella effect with it. Basically, if you dug past bedrock and jumped down the hole, you world would be mirrored on the otherside of the hole. I remember my friend showing it to me and he still remembers it too. I also remember showing it to sister who, also remembers this being a thing. I can't find anything about it online, but that's no sipprise considering how small the Legacy Edition community is (and was) do any of y'all who played early Legacy Edition Minecraft remember something similar to this?

Sorry for any bad grammar/spelling, please tell me if you know anything about the above!

Edit:
This wasn't enough words so I guess I'll tell you about the Shadow People.

The first time I saw a Shadow Person (whom I've named Jerry) I was 4-5, it was just a dark hamanoid flash across my vision. Being so young I immediately ran to my parents, it was like 6:00 a.m. on a weekend so they were still asleep. I told them what I saw and they basically said "it was just your imagination" can you believe they said that to a clearly disturbed 5 y/o?! 

Anyway the second time, my friend was over and it was probably 9:00 p.m. we were around 7-8 so we had already been put to bed. That's when I saw our good ol' pal Jerry hovering in the middle of my room. "Hey, do you see that?" I asked my friend. 
 "See what? Just go back to sleep [my name]."
What's interesting is we were talking about it recently and he said, "Bro, remember that one time a you asked me if I could see a ghost in your room?"
  "Um, yeah I do. Why?"
  "I did see it. I just didnt want to freak you out any further."

The third time I was with my mom, but that doesn't matter 'cause she didn't see shit. We were outside walking and there he was Jerry floating there nothing but the mere silhouette of a person. This time I got a much better look at him. He appeared to swirl and I couldn't tell where he began and the rest of his surroundings ended. Look at your arm, see how you can tell "Oh that's where my arm ends and the air around it begins" well with Jerry I couldn't tell that. He seemed to blend into air, like how a electron cloud ends (if that makes sense).
