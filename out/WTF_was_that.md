This happened several years ago. To understand what happened you need to understand the layout of my house. It was a trailer, so it was pretty small. When you walked in you would be met with the kitchen/dining room on your right and the den on your left. Off of the den is a hallway, a few feet down is what (at the time) was my older sister's bedroom. Farther down was a washer and dryer, across from there was a curtain covered door that leads outside the house and was almost always locked. A bit further down was the bathroom, and then my bedroom. There would be a door in my bedroom that if you were to look down the hallway you could easily see. That door led to my parents' room.

I was walking down the hallway in my house. The hallway door, as always, was shut and locked with the curtain over it. As I walked past the curtain I remember seeing a thin, pale, clawed hand reaching out from under it. The hand grabbed my ankle and I remember trying to shake it off, but being unable to. Strangely the memory ends there. I have no clue what happened after that. The memory also has no sound, like, I don't remember hearing anything during this nor what the hand's grip felt like. This experience has left a permanent effect on me. Every time I walk past that curtain I always move to the wall farthest from it and press up against the drier.

Years later I saw a "demon" like thing out my window. In the kitchen/dining room there's a large square window that lets you look out into the front yard. I was looking out that window while eating breakfast when I saw it. It was that same thin hand. Its arms were two different lengths, it had no ears or nose, it had six slits where its eyes would be, and a large slit where a mouth would be. It also had two big wings coming out of its back. It disappeared shortly after I saw it, but I'll never forget its stare. A cold stare that seemed a mixture of unfeeling blankness and mild amusement.

It's been months since then, but the thought of that *thing* still lurking around my house still scares me. I've begun to think that The Hand and The Demon are the same entity. I have no clue what it could want with me or why, but I'm not the only person who lives here that's seen paranormal things. Me, my sister, my dad, as well as my uncle have all seen Shadow People and/or other ghost-like entities. I'll share some of those stories soon. But right now, I want to focus on The Demon, whom I've just named "Thihna Ramhuai" or Thihna for short. It just makes sense for Thihna to be The Hand. Thihna's left hand looks the *exact* same, and The Hand would have been on the left side of the body. I have no idea when they'll show up again but, let's just say I'm not excited.
