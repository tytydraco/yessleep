I was doing a homestay with the Black Hmung, a tribe in northern Vietnam.  My shoes were probably ruined as the mud was terrible and the tiny slippery paths between homes up the steep mountain were difficult to navigate.  My guide’s English was understandable but not very good; it seemed like she frequently didn’t understand what I said to her.  They knew little to nothing of me.

She had been talking about her spirituality and mentioned her Shaman several times.  I had been trying to get the opportunity to meet them a finally she said yes.  We walked down a steep slippery path, slowly and carefully.  We arrived at a well-constructed wooden home built by the occupants; just like all the others in this primitive village.

My guide said, “She doesn’t speak any English so I’ll have to translate for you.”

We went inside and I sat in a chair, smelling smoke from a fire used to heat the building while the Shaman shook a bag with something inside. I watched with curiosity as she threw what could have been buffalo horn pieces out onto the ground and started reading them.

She spent a few minutes doing this, looking at me in surprise here and there. Her pupils were wide and concerned-looking when she did. Suddenly, she went to two of the horns - one was crisscrossed over the other. She had a satisfied look on her face as she physically separated the two and then came over to my guide and spoke in a language I couldn't understand.

The guide suddenly looks very surprised, her head moved backward just slightly.  She turned to me and asked, "Are you a widow?" to which I replied, "Uh, yeah. How did you know?"

She looked surprised and said, "Marriage has spiritual ramifications.  You look so young, I would have never guessed you would be a widow at your age." before continuing the discussion with her religious figure.

She finally looks at me again and says, "My auntie says the spirit of your spouse is still attached to you and trying to drag you to the underworld. She's creating all sorts of problems in your life. But don't worry, she detached it for you. As long as you focus on the good parts of life you should be able to keep it detached. I'm also giving you this copper bracelet to wear, it should help ward off the spirit. But uh, you may have to deal with her again after you die."

I had a multitude of thoughts here. It was fascinating that she could somehow magically know I was widowed but not know it was a gay marriage. This must mean the spirit world at least respects them. Not good, especially if I have to deal with him again after I die. But at least it's detached for now. I've been assaulted something like 50 times in the last few years, had to survive what amounted to invasions on my person by armed groups of 20 or more at least 10 times, and suffered near-death experiences due to a shocking number of surprise accidents. Perhaps this will start to abate so I can live again?
