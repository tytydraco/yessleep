I’m not messing with you my neighbor’s brother disappeared 9 years ago near a damn volcano, and last night, that kid was tapping at my window like he’d dragged himself out of hell.
This went down in my sleepy-ass Oregon town too quiet, until it decides to bite. I grew up next to the Hartleys, basically my second family. Lynn, the mom, always looked like she was one bad day from breaking; Greg, the stepdad, creeped me out with his muttering; and Eliora she’s been my ride-or-die since we were kids stealing tampons and sneaking smokes. She’s loud, fearless, the kind of girl who’d watch The Conjuring and call it cute. We’d hit the lake at night, chain-smoking until our throats burned, swapping ghost stories to see who’d crack first.

Last week, she wrecked me.

“Do you remember I had a brother?” she asked, her voice catching.

I stared at her, mid-puff. “What? No way, E. It’s always been just you.”

She fumbled her lighter, hands shaky. “His name was Micah. Nine years ago, we were camping near Mount Delinore. He took off into the woods by the crater… and never came back.”

Cops said wolves or a fall—total bullshit. Eliora swears she heard something that night a weird hum, like music stuck in reverse. Micah chased it, grinning like a little shit. She lost him to the dark.
Her family unraveled after. Greg started sleepwalking, clawing up the yard, whispering creepy Latin crap. Lynn acted like Micah was a memory she’d torched wouldn’t even look at his old room. And the worst part? No one else remembers him. Not nosy Mrs. Carter next door, not our old teachers, not even me—and I practically lived there, raiding their fridge and crashing on their couch.

“He’s like a ghost in time,” she said, her voice cracking.

Last night—2:13 AM—I heard it. Tap. Tap. Tap.

Slow, like someone screwing with me.

I yanked the curtain back, and my stomach flipped. A kid, maybe 16, covered in mud, pale as death, eyes big and hollow. He stared right into me.
“You don’t belong here,” he whispered. “None of us do.”
He vanished before I could scream.
I told Eliora at dawn, still shaking. She didn’t say shit—just grabbed Micah’s journal from under her bed. It reeked of mold, pages falling apart. One line hit me like a slap.

“The volcano’s awake. It’s a door. I saw us—different, messed-up versions. One looked like me. He said, ‘You get lost eventually.’ My clock’s going backward now. I’m scared, E.”

We tore through Greg’s junk next. Found a photo stuffed in the wall black-and-white, 1964, some science geeks at Mount Delinore. Micah’s right there, smirking like he’s got secrets. On the back: “Project Helix. They come back. Never the same.”
Then, under a floorboard, Eliora pulled out a black stone shard—cold, humming, scratched with spirals. She held it like it burned.

“He had this,” she said, eyes wild. “The day before he was gone.”

People here say Mount Delinore hums sometimes. They see dead family, weird shadows—stuff that’d make you lock your doors. Eliora looked at me, all fire and fear.

“We’re going up there,” she said. “Tonight.”
At the crater, our phones went haywire—screens glitching, clocks spinning back. The shard in her hand buzzed louder, matching the warped music creeping up from the dark.

She stepped closer. The ground shook. I grabbed for her, yelling, “E, no!” but she was gone, sucked into the black with the shard.

I screamed her name until my throat was raw.

She stumbled back out.

But she was wrong.

Older. Hair tangled, gray streaks. Eyes like she’d aged a lifetime in a blink.

“You shouldn’t have come,” she rasped, tears streaking her face. “We screwed it up again.”
She shoved a photo at me us at the volcano, old and laughing. I wasn’t even born when it was taken. She looked exactly like she did now.

That photo hit hard, but the real punch came when my mom, Jen, found a drawing I’d done as a kid messy crayons, a boy with empty eyes by a volcano. My handwriting: “My future friend, Micah.”
I don’t remember him. I don’t remember that. But Eliora’s words stuck: “This town messes with your head.”

She wouldn’t talk after the crater—just smoked, staring at nothing, the shard tight in her fist. I begged her, “E, what’s happening?”
“Read the damn journal,” she snapped, chucking it at me.

I found a page we’d missed—Micah’s words, shaky, smeared with what looked like blood.

“The spiral’s real. Time’s a trap. The volcano’s the center. I saw Mom, Greg, you, E—over and over, different lives, same shitty end. One me slit his throat to get out. He still smiled. The shard’s aliveit calls us.”

Eliora wiped her eyes. “He didn’t just vanish. He woke something. And it’s after us.”

That night, Greg went nuts. I heard him outside, digging like a psycho, chanting Latin mixed with a growl that made my skin crawl. I peeked out. Shadows moved with him—tall, twisted, faces smudged. One turned. Micah’s eyes, glowing.
I ran to Eliora’s, heart pounding. She was ready bag packed, knife out, shard humming.

“We end this,” she said, voice fierce. “Crater. Now.”
We climbed in the dark, the humming so loud it shook my bones. At the top, the shard flared, and the ground split—a red, pulsing rift, spitting heat and static. Then Micah stepped out. Not the kid. Older. Scarred. Blood all over his lab coat.
“Hey, sis,” he said, smirking. “Late again.”
Eliora lunged, knife flashing. He grabbed her wrist, twisted it, and threw her toward the rift. I tackled him, slamming him down, screaming, “Let her go, you bastard!”

He laughed, blood bubbling up. “We’re stuck, you idiot. Copies. The volcano chews us up, the shard drags us back. I’m trying to save her.”

I froze. He shoved me off, pointed at the rift. People spilled out—Micahs, Elioras, me. Some broken, some kids, all screaming backward. An old Eliora—scarred, white-haired—looked at me.
“Run,” she mouthed.

Too late. The ground erupted. Micah grabbed Eliora and jumped into the rift. I dove after them, yelling her name.

I woke up in ash, alone. No rift. No Eliora. Just the journal—new page, my handwriting: “You tried. You’re next.”

I got home. Her house was trashed empty, dusty. Neighbors said, “Hartleys? Gone since ’93. Kids disappeared at the volcano. Parents bailed.”
Then Mom hit me with it. She dragged a box from the attic—rusted, scratched with spirals. Inside, a letter in her messy scrawl.

“Your great-grandpa worked Helix. Brought the shard home. It took him. Took me. Now you. We’re its blood, baby. Burn this if you can.”

Next to it, a photo—me, Eliora, Micah, Mom, at the volcano, laughing. Dated 1959. I wasn’t born. She’d be a kid. But there we were. And in the back, my great-grandpa, holding the shard, grinning.

My phone buzzed. A voice message Micah, rough and low.

“Run, or the spiral eats you. It’s got your blood now.”

Mom’s gone now. Her room’s empty, like she was never real. I looked in the mirror my face is older, scarred, eyes like Micah’s. The tapping’s back. It’s me outside, holding the shard, smiling.

Here’s the worst part: I found my birth certificate. It’s blank no name, no date. The volcano’s humming, and my hands won’t stop shaking. If you know Eliora or Micah Hartley, tell me. I’m still me. I’m begging you don’t let me disappear.
