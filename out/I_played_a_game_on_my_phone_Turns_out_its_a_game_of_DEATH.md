When I was 12 years old I had a game on my phone. The game was called Giggle Rot. The object of the game was to collect as much gold as possible. In the game, you have to leave the house and return within 60 seconds with as much gold as you can find. There are three rounds and each round is harder than the previous one. I used to play this game a lot, but especially when my parents fought. The game also had a phone from which a man would tell you where the gold was.

One night, I turned on the game. But for some reason the game just shut down. After a while the game came back but it was different. In fact, more different than you might imagine. Instead of collecting gold, I collected... bodies.

**ROUND 1**

Round one begun. and I started collecting the gold. The man on the phone started saying "The gold is 30 meters away" and I started walking towards the bodies... When I made it, I was shocked. The body... It was my mom's and my father was next to me staring at me. I started to get streesed and closed the game. And suddenly, I heard a knock on the door.

"Whos there?" I asked.

And suddenly I saw Dad opening the door. He smiled at me with a big smile. "Goodnight, my girl". I asked him where mom was because she usually said good night to me first. "She is sleeping" he said. But I didn't believe him. Mom always said goodbye to me. "Goodnight" I said and pretended to be asleep. When Dad closed the door. I waited a few minutes and opened it. But then I got a message on my phone. It was from the game saying "Isn't it quiter without her?" Then I looked up and saw Dad looking at me. He seemed very happy and it scared me a little. "Do you have fun playing the game?" He asked me in a deep soothing tone. Suddenly, he moved 2 steps to the right. That's when I saw, a floor full of blood leading to a body. And yes, it was my mom's body. I threw my phone at him and started running away from the house. My father didn't move and kept smiling at me with his creepy face. I managed to get away, terrified. I called the cops, but they couldn't find anything. Dad ran away, and I never saw him again. The strange thing is that my mother's body... dissapeared too.

Ever since then, I never saw him. I am sure that this guy... wasn't my Dad. He wasn't the dad I knew.

Until.

Yesterday, I got a message in my phone and I couldn't believe my eyes. The message was written like this: "Hey... Its me. We haven't seen each other for a long time. I miss you a lot. I have a lot to explain to you, but we'll have to meet face to face. Meet me at our old house, hopefully, you'll understant everything too. I love you... meet me at times square.

From Mom"

I was shocked. Mom is... No. It can't be. Mom is dead. but who would do this to me? Why would someone abuse me like this? I don't know... But curiosity is killing me. And that's why... I'm on a plane right to New York. I might regret this decition, but I have to find out... What the hell happened to mom?

If you want to know the truth about what happened to my mother... Write part 2 in the comments.
