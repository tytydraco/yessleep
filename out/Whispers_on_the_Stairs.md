Everything was fine except for those stairs... The house was always full of grandchildren who stayed for weekends at a time — sometimes with parents and other cousins, like at Christmas when all the siblings and their kids gathered at Grandma’s house, and sometimes alone, when the parents were trying to sort out their problems, although as kids we didn’t know that. 

The house was pretty big for the three siblings and their families to be there during birthdays or celebrations, and those days were great. We played outside all day and came back inside for dinner and sleep. But when it rained we had to stay indoors; we would play board games, make prank calls, or play hide-and-seek. Whoever was brave enough to climb the stairs on their own always won. I did it a couple of times, but only when the lights were on.

We went up with our backs against the wall because we would never dare to walk in the center, looking up and hurrying as much as we could, yet we would still feel a cold hand touch one of our legs, or our shoulders or arms, and hear a creepy whisper calling our names. It was not so bad when we saw an adult at the top or bottom of the stairs — if we were going down — but they were usually in the kitchen or the living room, doing adult things.

When we weren’t with cousins, we would stay on the same floor as Grandma and go to bed when she did. Mia tried to tell her father that something was wrong, but being a military man, he was not pleased; his three kids had to be strong. Grandma lost three cats after I was born, in that house. They didn’t die — they just vanished. None of them liked going out. She remembered two of them on the top of the stairs, looking down, before no one ever saw them again.

Mia and Maya got a puppy once during Christmas vacation. I was really jealous, but I didn’t know until later that it was to compensate for Daddy not being there on Christmas... or New Year... or being home. I remember the adults mentioning another woman, but I thought perhaps it was an aunt I didn’t know about. They left the puppy downstairs to prevent him from peeing in the rooms, and although the dog could perfectly well use the steps, the poor thing cried all night at the bottom of the stairs, too afraid to go up; he didn’t let anyone sleep, so they stopped bringing him to Grandma’s.

Once it was so hot that Grandma left the front door open, and a bird accidentally flew in; Mia’s mother saw it die in the middle of the stairs. Nora, Nico and Nestor’s dad got rid of it. Another night, when the three siblings and I were watching TV, the wind was so strong that the power cut out, and when my Grandma — who was alone with us — came downstairs with a candle so we wouldn’t be afraid, the candle went out by itself in the middle of the stairs, even though there was no power. We felt chills. She asked me to go to her room to get her lighter, but I absolutely refused. None of us dared.

One summer night, the weather was nice and we were not so small anymore, so they let us camp in the garden. The six cousins were together in a tent, and that was the first time we ever talked about the stairs. We’d all noticed the others behaving weird when going up or down on their own, and even in pairs we climbed holding hands with our backs against the wall. Still, we didn’t tell the adults. We knew that if this reached them, we wouldn’t be allowed to watch horror movies anymore — not even early shows, not even on vacation — and we all loved horror. We knew better.

We believed each other: we had all felt the cold wind, we had all gotten scratches, and we had all heard “come to me” many times, but we had not said anything. Nora said she had her hair pulled once, and Maya said she heard a loud, horrifying scream. I didn’t hear the scream, but I remember when it happened because she cried in her mom’s bed until very late. She was the youngest of us. Once I felt an uncontrollable urge to cry, but since I was ashamed I locked myself in the bathroom so no one would see me, and I never told anyone.

The air grew heavy. We heard a crack, like a branch falling, and the lanterns stopped working. The six of us huddled together and started talking about cartoons, pretending we weren’t scared. Maybe we shouldn’t have talked about that, but from that day things got worse.

Doors started opening and closing, toys disappeared, the TV shut off by itself, we heard knocks on the walls, felt cold drafts pass through us like needles, and every now and then a bird would die by crashing against a window. If the bedroom doors were open at night, we would see a terrifying shadow watching us. None of us wanted to be there anymore, but it was the only place that could hold the entire family, and Grandma was the only one who watched the kids when the adults could not. We never said why, but Mia and Maya threw massive tantrums when they arrived. However, when the six of us were together, we were as okay as we could be.

We all insisted on sleeping together, so since that house was the playhouse for all the siblings, they allowed us to set up a tent in one of the rooms. Once they sent us to bed, we would not leave the tent for our lives during the whole night. Nico, Nora and I — the oldest three — didn’t mind going to bed at the same time as the little ones. We liked the tent; it made us get closer, and when the adults weren’t there, except for Grandma, or when they were fast asleep, we could spend hours talking and being silly — until a grasping, inhuman whisper would shut us up. Still, we didn’t tell each other what we had heard.

A black stain began appearing in the center of the stairs. My dad, the handiest of the three siblings, checked it out. It wasn’t mold, humidity, or dirt. It looked as if the wood had been burnt with a blowtorch, and it continued growing every day. I started having nightmares — we all did — and you could see it on each other’s faces. Mia became troubled and cried to her mom trying to explain, but her mother blamed it all on the father leaving them. Nora, who was my age, tried to tell her parents — the only ones still together — and although her mother, my dad’s sister, wanted to hear more, her husband forbade her to continue with that nonsense and warned his brothers.

When my dad returned from a tour and met us all, he listened to us. I don’t know if he was playing along, but he seemed genuinely worried. He kept saying, “I should have known this was going to happen,” and promised us that on Monday he would try to fix it. It was Friday evening, so at least we had some hope.

We all went upstairs together in groups of three holding hands, cleaned up, and returned to our cousins’ tent. Saturday went smoothly until Nora and Nestor’s continued talk about the “monster” made their dad furious. Nico did not dare say anything. Their father got so angry at the monster nonsense, especially coming from a 12-year-old and an almost-11-year-old, that he grounded them — upstairs — to prepare them for going back to school, so Nico stayed downstairs with us while Nora and Nestor were in their room, grounded. They came down for dinner, but their father sent them back up. We felt bad for them, but there was not much we could do. My dad never liked his sister’s husband much, so he would not negotiate.

He was locked in the study rehearsing on his keyboard, Grandma was watching a soap opera with one of her daughters, and Nora’s parents were discussing something in the kitchen. We were playing with some toy cars on the living-room floor near Grandma when we all heard a gurgling, raspy, horrible scream that did not sound human, as the lights blinked and the power went out. We froze. Mia, Maya, Nico and I clung to each other as we heard a horrible scream that seemed to come from Nora. I wanted to stand up, but I didn’t dare let go of my cousins. There were loud bangs on the walls, as if someone were hitting them with a hammer, and Maya started crying. I held her and felt her mother crawl to us from the couch where she had been watching TV to hold us all.

We heard another huge scream that chilled me; I wanted to cry but I didn’t want to scare the little girls any further. I heard my dad call from the studio to ask if everyone was okay and the steps of Nora’s parents coming from the kitchen. We could see nothing. There was no outside light... it seemed worse than a power cut. However, we could hear that the kitchen door and the studio door were stuck — only open a little so we could hear the adults but not enough for them to reach the living room and come to us. Another bang, like a car crash, was heard, and Nora’s mother cried out desperately asking if they were okay.

Nora yelled, “The monster is here, Mom!” Nora’s father was a very strong man but he could not move the door an inch. I heard Grandma fiddling with her lighter but no spark came. Then it started — what felt like an earthquake. I sensed Grandma walk to the front door, but it seemed immovable too. The little girls, Nico and I were screaming and crying; dishes and pictures fell from the wall while Nora and Nestor screamed, stuck at the top of the stairs. Their dad yelled, “Come down!” only to hear a “No!” from Nestor, who was crying too. “Come down! We need to get out!!” Nestor replied, “No, Daddy, please!” Everything was chaos. Then Nora’s mom yelled to her, “Come on, honey — you know those stairs!!” Nora replied, “I’m going,” to which Nestor yelled, “Nora, no!”

Then... the earthquake or whatever it was, stopped. All the cousins downstairs stopped crying, confused. The lights blinked and returned to a house that was covered in some kind of stinky greenish fog. Mia and Maya’s mom was holding them as well as Nico and me on the floor, and the kitchen and studio doors opened as if they had never been stuck. Grandma was still by the closed front door.

But Nora was not there. Not at the top of the stairs, not on the stairs, not at the bottom, not by the door. Nowhere. The stain on the stairs was gone.

Nora’s mother ran to hold Nestor, who was as pale as a corpse but said nothing about whatever had happened up there, and the men went up to see a room with beds upside down and a tent cut to pieces. They frantically searched for Nora, but she was nowhere. The windows had security bars, so she could not have gotten out that way. Grandma finally opened the front door and all the adults — except Mia’s mom, who stayed with us — went outside calling Nora.

I remembered us playing on the floor at around 8 p.m., but now the clock showed 1:23 a.m. The adults knocked on neighbors’ doors. There had been no earthquake, nor a power outage. They called the police. It was not difficult to see they thought my father, Grandma and Nico’s parents were crazy. The guard at the street gate had never seen anyone leave. Nora was not there and would never be seen again to this day. Police reports, flyers, even TV interviews didn’t help. I often thought that since Nora and I were the same age, it could have been me. My dad seemed really shaken and I heard him moan, “I could have avoided this.” We, the cousins, never mentioned the “monster.”

Grandma moved not long after that, and things were never the same again. A few weeks ago Grandma died. I went to her place to look for some books I treasured as a child, to give them to my best friend’s daughter, and there, under the children’s books, was one covered in a dark cloth. I removed the cloth to find an old engraved leather cover with a drawing I did not understand. Curiosity got the best of me and I opened it. It had my grandfather’s name. I started turning the pages, reading horrible titles and looking at super creepy illustrations and symbols, until I found a page divider... I froze. It said, “How to cast a demon from your home.”
