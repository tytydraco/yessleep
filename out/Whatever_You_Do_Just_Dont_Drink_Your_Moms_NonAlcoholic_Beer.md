Before I get into the whole story, I just wanna be super clear about this, I don’t belong here, okay? Yeah, maybe I was a little down after the court hearing. Who wouldn’t be after hearing their dad say that they weren’t their kid? I’m big enough to admit that it fucked with me a little. I just don’t think drinking some non-alcoholic beers my mom’s boyfriend left in the fridge for like two months was a good enough reason. I mean, I smoked a little weed, but she doesn’t know that.

​

So when my mom came into my room and told me she was sending me to some school upstate and started packing my bags, I thought she was bluffing. Like she was trying to scare me straight or some bullshit. I think it was like three or four hours into the drive that it finally hit me. I damn near begged her to take me home. If there was something worth promising that could change her mind, trust me, I probably tried.



I guess the real fun part was finding out it wasn’t some boarding school. Have you ever heard of a home for troubled teens cause I haven’t. These people took the whole Christian thing to a whole new level. Even as we drove in, it felt like some weird prison. There were a bunch of kids carrying logs in a circle.

​

I still remember my mom’s face when we said our final goodbye. It was this satisfied grin, like she was doing me a favor.



So, here’s the rundown: there are levels to this shit. I mean literally. We each get a level based on our behavior. There’s C-level, that’s the normal level. Everyone starts there. Then there’s E-level, that basically means you’ve been a good boy. You’ve got PC, that's like you’ve got responsibilities and stuff. You’re the hall monitor basically. There’s junior staff, pretty self-explanatory, and then staff. There are two other levels, but we’ll get to those later.



I found out that some of the kids here actually had judges sentence them here, isn’t that funny? You got a guy who set fire to a car, and he gets this place as a sentence. I don’t know if that should depress me or if I should be happy that the kid got off so easy.

​

Wait til I tell you about the worst rule of all, we can’t talk to the girls. I mean, it was completely segregated, can you believe that? We can’t even look at them without being scolded. It’s like some kind of humiliation ritual for them to shout out that one of us was staring. Whatever, don’t want god to smite me down, I guess. Also, don’t they know the more they restrict something, the more people want it? Like they’re not doing my ears any favors, okay. I know my roommate Chris thinks he’s being sneaky, but I can hear him jerking off while I’m trying to sleep.

​

Anyway, if I’m being honest, the first few months were pretty miserable. It wasn’t just the Jesus shit, okay, and there was a lot of it. I mean, school was basically some cubicles and these little worksheet books for each lesson. Each of these fucking things had these VeggieTales-lite drawings of little Susie saying a prayer before I do my multiplication. Don’t even get me started on the science ones.



It wasn’t even that every morning we had to go listen to the dear old pastor read write-ups and hand out punishment. Okay, sue me, there’s no goddamn privacy in the showers, okay? I didn’t feel comfortable showering next to a bunch of schlongs, so yeah, I would sneak into the showers in the middle of the night with my little flashlight, just so I could get a good soak before bed. So I had to get publicly shamed not just in front of the guys but the girls, too? fuck PC Eric or whatever, just cause he didn’t see me shower doesn’t mean I didn’t. Also fuck the pastor, too. I got really fucking tired of hearing him preach about the end of days. He was one of those types; he really wanted some kind of gold star for trying to use the bible as a roadmap for the apocalypse. Fat fucking piece of shit.

​

You think I wanted to shower in the dark. Of course not. Every time I turned on the stupid water, you could hear that loud ass banging in the pipes. Sounded like they were going to rip out of the walls. Also, the showers are really creepy at night, like really creepy. I swear, sometimes while I’m in there, I can hear voices. It’s not like I’m hearing someone talk in the hallway or something. It’s like a bunch of voices grouped together, mumbling. It almost feels like a chant, and I can never tell if it’s just part of the noise the pipes make or if there’s something fucked about this place at night. You bet I run my chubby little ass back to my room as soon as the showers are off. I know better than to look back.

​

That's basically how I found out about six to tens. Remember those kids carrying logs in a circle, loading and unloading them onto a stack? Well, I got to join them. Can you guess why they call them six to tens? No? Okay, well that's how long we have to do it for, 6pm to 10pm. You can’t talk, you can’t do anything except load and unload. If I wasn’t doing that, I was probably running laps. The pastor had a sense of humor, had to make sure I thinned out I guess. The laps were the size of a football field and a soccer field combined. I think we did the math on it at some point, it was like three of those laps were a mile. I’m still not sure which one I hate more.

​

I wasn’t a fan of how there was only a single light shining on the whole circle by the second half of our shift. Sometimes it was easy to forget that this place sat in the middle of nowhere. There wasn’t another town for miles. Something about that always got my stomach churning. It didn’t help that you’d hear these strange noises coming from the woods. It almost sounded like slurping. Seeing the stars was a plus, though. You can’t see them in the city.

​

They had a weight room, it helped a little to put my anger into something. In a few months, I had built some muscle and a little confidence. Thought I’d try football tryouts, but they didn’t really have a JV team, and nobody told me maybe it wouldn’t be a good idea to let the thirteen-year-old play defensive line against the six-foot giant eighteen-year-old. It wasn’t pretty. I found myself wrapped around his ankles, trying to keep him checked.

​

I know what this place wants from me. How it wants me to talk, how it wants me to dress. Most of those things I got no choice on, cause there’s only so many laps and six to tens I can do before I start to lose it. Also, No-Level is so much worse.

​

The thing is, I knew enough by this point that I could let them think I’m on the path. I’m on the straight and narrow. Jesus save my soul and all that. I just hated how it felt on my body. I hated having to do the whole dance.

​

That’s why when I looked out my window and saw Derrick making a run for it, I was rooting for him. It was pitch black, but I could see his figure booking it past the football field. The staff were all scrambling, but he already had a huge head start.

​

There were a bunch of rumors about Derrick and how far he made it. Anthony thinks they found him, and they have him in one of the staff rooms, on some kind of super No-Level until they can calm him down. Gabriel says he heard that they spent hours driving down the main road looking for him, but couldn’t find him. Adam says he heard one of the staff members say Derrick got bit by something in the woods and he’s in the hospital. I don’t know, I have a hard time believing Adam, the whole reason he got here is cause he took too much acid and drove his car into a streetlight.

​

So I try to do the smart thing, well, I mean, it depends on who you ask. Let’s just say I was trying to prepare myself, I was being careful. Anyway, I approached Caleb, cause I heard from very shady sources that he found a way to pass notes to the girls. You see, I’m pretty sure during one of the meals, one of the few times we can ever actually see the girls' faces, I thought I saw one taking a look. I don’t know, maybe this place is getting to me. It’s not like girls were lining up to get to know me before. So exchanging glances is about as close as I’ve ever gotten to first base. I was desperate, but also seeing Derrick run into those creepy ass woods lit a fire up my ass or something.

​

Stupid oaf Caleb wouldn’t even let me finish my sentence, though.

​

“Is that a threat?” He says.

​

He slapped the shit out of me. I swear I took a ten-minute nap on the grass, drool and all. I won’t lie, I cried a little bit after. Stupid ass bitch, the guy is built like a tank. Who gives a fourteen-year-old steroids? He has biceps the size of a small baby’s head.

​

Derek was back, at least that’s what everyone was saying. We hadn’t seen him in about a week. Anthony was starting to get a little too cocky with his I-told-you-so’s. Lucky me, I got kitchen duty, so I got to confirm it firsthand. It wasn’t enough that I had to help make the food; I had to go hand deliver it to his room too. Had to go knock on Silva’s door to deliver it. Really makes No-level feel like a cake walk compared. Usually, No-Level and A-Level can’t go out their rooms during downtime, but at least they can have lunch in the cafeteria. I mean, No-Level have their own segregated tables, and they can’t talk, but at least they can be around other people. I don’t know, I kinda felt bad for the guy.

​

When the door opened, though, I managed to get a good look at Derrick, sitting in the bottom bunk. Oof, he looked rough. He had some nasty bags under his eyes. Had a little snot dripping down his nose, too. His whole head was sweaty, hair, face, neck. Could have sworn he had a little puddle on his upper lip forming. I’ve also never seen a person look that grey. Must have caught some serious bug out in the woods. I didn’t even mean anything by it when I said it; I was rooting for the guy. So I say, “The woods were pretty rough, huh, Derrick.”

​

He gives me this creepy ass stare. Looks through my soul. I don’t even like what he was doing with his eyebrows. He had this shitty little grin forming in his mouth. Motherfucker licked his lips while his eyes penetrated me. The whole thing gave me chills. Wanna know the worst thing, the boy didn’t say one word while I was there hand-delivering his food, by the way. No thank you either. Once I get out of the room, though, he’s all like, “I’ll be seeing you around, Danny.”

​

Like, what the fuck does that mean? You see, Caleb, that's a threat. Stupid fucking oaf.

​

I got some bad news on my weekly call with my mom. I mean, it’s not bad news for her. It’s not even really bad news for me either. It’s just weird. She’s getting married, she said. Gonna have a whole wedding. It’s not like I can say what I wanna say or anything. I gotta play the good Christian boy, or I might never see the outside of this place again. The way they talk about becoming staff, it’s like they want me as one of their trophies one day, no thanks.

​

It just makes you think you know? Was I really that bad that this is what I deserved? Like, don’t I matter at all in this whole equation either? I barely even know the guy, like, what is he supposed to be to me now? Dad? Oh, gross. Like, damn, it just makes me feel like I was getting in the way.

​

Sam seems to think that it’s great news that my mom is getting married. He also says that while screaming for the poor nurse to bring him strawberries and rams his RC car into her foot. Severe ADD and Diabetic is a crazy combination. He thinks there’s no way she has a wedding without me. I’ve got a sure-fire way home. I don’t know, that’s not what it feels like to me.

​

The whole common area was starting to feel like a ghost town. The boy’s dorm staff was running on a skeleton crew at this point because so many of them were getting sick watching Derrick. They even had to get the E-Levels to babysit; they were so desperate. I didn’t have to sneak into the showers at night anymore, not like I wanted to anyway. I’ve been hearing some creepy-ass noises coming from the halls. Banging and scratching, and some weird yelping sound. I was not about to go out there in the middle of all that.

​

The thing is, though, I did need to pee. So badly, I don’t think you understand how mad I was that I even needed to. Like, why couldn’t I have just gone before lights out? It was just bang after bang in the hall. I didn’t know if there was a door being slammed or what. So you know what I do, right? What else can I do? I open my door just a crack. I see just enough of Derrick to know he is not okay.

​

His arms were wailing wildly into one of the doors, and the banging traveled, because of course they did. They were made out of steel or something. I’m not built to be sneaky; it’s not in my nature. So yeah, I let the door creak, and yeah, Derick noticed. He noticed enough to turn and stare at me directly. Like he knew, even though I was barely even peaking out my doorway to check. The thing is, the guy is wearing the same clothes I saw him wearing a week or so ago. Whatever light was blinking out in the hall was just enough for me to see the dirty stains on his sweater. I could smell it too.

​

Derrick sprints full speed at my door, and I just hold with every bit of strength I have as he begins banging and banging. He screamed at the top of his lungs, like what is wrong with this guy. Also, for the love of God, why hasn’t he showered? He smelled so bad. I mean, he smelled like shit, I don’t mean bad, I mean doo doo. I hold on to that door so long I’ve managed to maneuver myself so I can sit down while I defend myself from this maniac. He wouldn’t stop screaming either.

​

“Come on out, Danny!”

​

“Don’t you wanna know what the forest was like, Danny?”

​

“Come on Danny let me in!”

​

Oh, and the slurping, that horrible slurping. I didn’t know whether to cry or to get in the fetal position and hope he tired himself out by morning, cause at this point he’d been doing this for hours. Maybe when the sun comes up, he’ll go back to his room. Yeah, maybe he’ll tire himself out. As soon as he stops, I’ll just try making a run for it. I know there are more important things I should be focused on right now, but fuck me, I never figured out her name. It’s not like it's my fault. The only time we ever get to hear it is during write-ups, and the girls sit behind us. So I have to play detective with their voices and hope I’ve correctly matched the voice and the face. Pathetic right? I got this horrible poop-infested demon banging on my door, and I can’t stop thinking if maybe her name is Sarah?

​

That’s what I’m going to do, I’m going to run to the girls dorm. I’ll explain everything, and maybe they’ll take pity on me, maybe I'll get to see Sarah. Fuck me, I really don’t want to die a virgin.



I ran. I mean, I let him barge the door open and slipped out as fast as I could, and I just booked it down the hallway. It wasn’t just Derek, though; the entire hall was filled with whatever Derek had become. It wasn’t Derek anymore, I was sure of that. It wasn’t Adam or Anthony or Sam. Fuck me and my fucking luck, I wish I had never drank that stupid non-alcoholic beer.

​

They chased me out the dorm and into the quad. I’m not even sure if I’m going to make it to the girls' dorm. What are the chances, really? I can’t even run a stupid lap without getting winded. I don’t even know why I’m fighting it anymore. They’re going to catch me, and I’ll just be another copy of a copy of them.

​

I can see the girls' dorm from here. There might be a chance. There’s maybe fifteen of them chasing me in the quad, and they all look like they're smeared in shit. I wish someone would fucking goddamn tell them that’s not how camouflage works.

​

So yeah, I get to the door. It was pink, like, really? Pink? I think for a split second that maybe I’ll be home free. I’ve survived the poop demons, and I can ride out whatever this is until the morning. Except I see the first girl, and I mean she’s just smeared in it. It doesn’t take me long to see Caleb’s husk shuffling in the back. Of course, he beat me here, fucking asshole. So this is it. They’re approaching me now and of course this is my luck. I’d give up and say some my-father’s but I’m pretty sure this place is baptist. What a sick joke, of course I'm destined to be just another asshole full of
