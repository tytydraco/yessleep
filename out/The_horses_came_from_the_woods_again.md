“They’re back,” said Thomas, peering short-sightedly through a gap in the curtains. “Ten or more, this time.”

I went to stand by my husband at the window to look. Sure enough, across from the house where the woods began was a group of black horses, all of them quite still, just as they’d been every night since we’d moved into the property.

We’d recently exchanged our city home for a cottage in a rural village, though technically we were on the outskirts, closer to the fields and forests than civilisation. As such we’d expected to see our fair share of nature, but there were no wild horses native to the area, though the ones we’d noticed come by after dark behaved as though they were, loitering, noiseless and aloof, beyond the house.

If we attempted to call out to them or approach they’d retreat into the woods again, their black muscle indistinguishable from the trunks of the enveloping trees.

“I wonder who they belong to,” I said, rubbing eyeholes into the condensation filming the windowpane. “If they do belong to anyone, that is. Seems strange letting horses like that roam about all over the place. You’d think someone would try to steal them.”

“I know,” said Thomas. “It’s even stranger that nobody’s missing them. I’ve asked the farmers and all the neighbours; nobody seems to have lost them. They were annoyed by me asking, if anything.”

I shrugged. In observing the horses I’d noticed they all seemed to have a deformity in their hind legs, a defect impossible to identify at a distance, and with an uneducated eye. Nevertheless, I could see this as a callous reason for their abandonment.

“They’re probably a nuisance, if you think about it,” I said. “Roaming about everywhere. Getting into crops and spoiling them.”

“Then why hasn’t anyone done anything?” asked Thomas. “You wouldn’t just leave them there, surely. They’re domestic animals. It’s neglect, isn’t it?”

I studied the horses, their manes overlong, tangled and unkempt, some sort of vegetation so caught up in the hair that it might have grown from the root.

“I suppose they are neglected,” I said.

“Well, then,” said Thomas. “Why isn’t anyone bothered about it?”

I had no answer to that. 

“Better not let Tara find out about this,” I said, referring to our daughter. “You know she still wants a horse for her birthday.”

We both laughed, relaxing slightly.

“God, imagine,” said Thomas. “She’d have me go out there catching one for her. No, thank you.”

“I wouldn’t let her have one, anyway,” I remarked. “Did I ever tell you my worst enemy as a child was a horse?”

Thomas laughed again.

“Your worst enemy? What?”

I grinned back at him, but my blood had coolled at the memory, just as it had when I'd first seen the herd of animals accumulate across the lawn.

“I’m serious," I said. "It belonged to the woman next door. She rescued it from somewhere, she said. Found the horse injured walking along a riverbank and took it in, saint that she was. It had a foul temperament. Hated everyone, more or less, but it really had it out for me. Every time it saw me coming it’d charge right across the field it was in and try biting me over the fence, not that I was ever stupid enough to get close.

Then one day it got out and chased me for miles. I don't know what it would have done if it had caught me. Trampled me, I suppose, but I remember thinking it wanted to eat me. Stupid, I know."

I couldn't stop looking at the band of beasts out by the wood, their coats so black they were almost green in the little light left to see them by.

"I got away from it, in the end," I said, "and I never saw that horse again. I heard it was euthanized. Something wrong with it. One of those obscure animal illnesses. I don’t know. But every time I see a horse now I just feel— I can't describe it. It's this feeling like they know, and they blame me for it all.”

Thomas touched my back lightly.

"You've always been sensitive, Carol."

"Don't I know it."

We were quiet then for a minute or so, leaning into one another, our hands enmeshed.

“Maybe we should call an animal rescue," said Thomas.

“Maybe," I said. "But who’d come all the way out here?”




Some weeks after this Thomas and I befriended a married couple from the village that had a daughter, Sarah, of around Tara’s age. Greg and Bernadette were odd in the affable way I was used to from my country upbringing, so we all got along well enough, pleased to have something to do with our evenings at last.

The girls would play together upstairs in Sarah’s room while Thomas and I joined her parents in sharing a beer or two and chatting about what little the village had of news and gossip at the time.

This talk was what led to us discussing the horses. They were still coming by the house on a nightly basis, a routine that had begun to disconcert us. None of the animal rescues or charities we’d contacted seemed to have gone out to the area, and all ignored us when we phoned them back to follow up on our reports.

“Oh, those things,” said Bernadette vaguely, stretching her legs in front of the hearth. “They’ve been around here for years. Harmless enough if you keep out of their way. Just don’t go trying to ride them or anything. They’re not that tame.”

“Well, how did they end up there?” my husband asked. “Were they dumped or something?”

Bernadette gave a lazy shrug.

“I’m not sure how they got there,” she said. “It’s just where they’ve always been.”

Thomas and I exchanged subtle glances.

“And nobody’s thought to try and catch them?” I asked, put off by Bernadette’s nonchalant air.

Greg leaned forward in his seat, a bottle of half-drunk cider dangling from one worn hand.

“There’s ways of catching them, certainly. I think someone might have done it, once or twice. But there’s so many of them now that if you tried it you’d risk them all going after you.”

I frowned, uneasy with the image this conjured of being chased through brambles and ragged bits of hedge, scratched bloody and out of breath.

“So they’re just to be left in the woods, then,” I said. “Nothing to be done.”

“It’s not the woods they’ve been living in,” said Bernadette, in a helpful tone. “It’s the lake.”

I saw Thomas’ eyebrows go up with interest.

“What lake?”



We drove out there the following afternoon on the way back from picking Tara up from school. It was a beautiful scene even at the heart of February, clear silvery water like a dropped pendant in the frosted meadow. Two black horses stood by the lake, motionless and almost artificial looking, the only suggestion of life being their breath steaming the air.

Behind me I felt Tara bounce in her seat.

“Oh, look!”

“And looking is all you’ll be doing,” I said sharply. “They don’t belong to anybody, so they’re not used to people. You keep away, Tara, please. Promise me.”

I swivelled to look back at her pouting face.

“Tara,” I said. “Promise.”

I turned my eyes to Thomas meaningfully, waiting for his support.

“It’s for the best,” he said at last, and only then did Tara—always her daddy’s girl—sigh and settle back in her seat.

“Okay,” she said. “Promise.”

Being familiar with my daughter, however, I knew the matter was far from settled. Two days later I passed Tara’s room to see a light on under her door long past her bedtime. Stepping in, I saw her balancing on tiptoe against the window, staring down at the ground below in quiet fascination. 

I went to stand by her, rubbing her shoulder through her unicorn pyjamas. The horses were down by the trees again, more than I recalled having seen the last time. Though it was impossible to tell from this height it appeared as though they were looking at the upper floor of the house, drawn to the light, or to the motion of our two figures within it.

“They’re all wet,” said Tara, tapping a finger against the windowpane. “Has it been raining?”

“They’ve probably been in the lake,” I said.

“Can horses swim?”

Tara, like most ten-year-olds, always had a dozen questions to ask about any subject, particularly her favourite one.

“Yes,” I said in answer. “They can.”

I thought of the horses night swimming, dark shapes kicking through depths of ink, and felt a chill even the bathrobe knotted around me couldn’t keep off my back.

“Don’t you go near them,” I said. “Horses can be dangerous.”

Tara considered this, tapping a rhythm on the window with one fingernail.

“My friend at school got bit by her horse, once.”

“Well, there you go, then,” I said firmly. “Even people that know horses can get hurt by them. You need to stay away. I don’t want anything to happen to you, my angel.”

Tara gave another of her wistful sighs, but she withdrew from the window and got back into bed all the same.

I closed the curtains for her, not liking the thought of leaving them open like an invitation for anything beyond to let itself in.



We were sitting down to dinner the following evening when this new superstition had me get up from the table to close all the blinds on the lower floor of the house. As I went to the first window I cried out in surprise, for the horses had come so close to it that their faces brushed the glass.

“Oh, god,” I said faintly. “What are they doing now?”

I could feel that old panic over me like a shower of ice, childish but potent.

“It's alright,” said Thomas, standing up from his seat. “I’ll go and shoo them off. They’ll probably run away when they see me coming.”

He went to open the front door and stood in the frame, waving his arms at the creatures gathered in the night. 

“Away!” he said. “Go on, now!”

But the horses neither retreated nor approached, only watched him in their alien, unreadable fashion, no flicking of ears or tails, or rooting at the ground with their hooves. They only stood as they always did, what they wanted from us still a mystery.

Suddenly I felt a small figure brush past me, turning in time to see Tara running for the door.

“I want to see them too!” she cried, and before Thomas could seize hold of her she’d squeezed past him and gone out across the garden where the first horses were gathered.

At last their heads turned, and as Tara approached one of the animals with a polite hand outstretched I called out to her in warning.

“Don’t!”

The horse lowered its head to Tara, allowing her to touch its broad neck. In the same moment she stiffened, attempting to jerk her arm back as though she’d been burned. Her hand did not move, the skin of the palm stuck fast to the horse’s pelt.

Thinking it had likely rolled in some sticky chemical dumped out illegally in the woods I thrust past my husband into the garden, meaning to pull Tara loose despite my fear of the animals around her. Spooked by my approach, the horse she’d touched tossed back its head, and the force of that gesture threw Tara up into the air across its back, her arm twisted painfully over itself.

With a start of shock I saw that my daughter’s dress and legs, too, had become fused with the horse’s flesh, and as she pulled at it her skin stretched painfully on the bone but didn’t come free. I could see nothing on the animal to have caused it; it was only wet with lake water, a mask across its face of bridling weeds from the deep.

Behind me I heard Thomas gasp.

“What is this?” 

I didn’t answer, could think of nothing to say or do. I only stood, my nose and throat thick with the pungent scent of horse and damp, a terror in me I'd known from my youth.

Tara’s trapped fingers reached for us, her staring eyes baring fearful whites.

“Mum! Dad!” 

Thomas and I made the same move towards her, but again the horse shied, and the others by it turned and began to make for the woods. Their speed was astonishing, I thought, being that all of them had a deformation in their hind limbs I’d noticed in the first group weeks before.

The horse that carried Tara looked at Thomas and I as though coldly challenging us to follow. Then it, too, ran, throwing all its weight forward as though it were swimming rather than running on land.

“Fetch the car,” I said at once. “They must be going for the lake.”

We scrambled over ourselves to get into the vehicle and took the road through the woods, Thomas shaking and muttering as I sat silent in the passenger seat, thinking of Greg and Bernadette. Wondering what they and the other villagers knew of the horses beyond what they’d told us.

Realising that—in their way—they had told us more than enough. 

The lake came suddenly into view ahead of us, and we pulled over to avoid going into it by mistake. Immediately we noticed the horses on the bank, shining and still. Shapes with eyes that didn’t seem to pick up any light. 

As we ran to them they turned and plunged into the black rim of the lake, Tara still wrestling on the back of the horse that held her like foam at the head of a wave. Thomas screamed, throwing himself out of the car and into the water up to his knees, but the horses moved fast, their bodies supple and strange.

I got out after my husband then and stood, petrified, on the bank. From there I saw what Thomas—blinded by the water kicked up by fleeing horses into his eyes—could not.

Later people would say that the dark had confused me, that the fear and the shock and the moving figures all jumbled together had made me see what wasn’t there. I’d have said the same to anyone else with a similar claim, after all.

Still, I’m certain of what I saw. Not even Thomas believed me afterwards, though he’d come so close to the horses that he’d touched one of their flanks with one flailing hand. I saw the twisted hind legs of those animals alter, thrown up in fans behind their muscular bodies until they were driven by these impossible tails into the depths. 

Tara was taken down with them, her red hair like a slap mark across her face as she turned to scream for us before the sound was eaten up by the water. Thomas dived in after her again and again, emerging each time sobbing, and retching, and empty armed, but I couldn’t move from the bank, could only watch him flail in futile efforts to bring our girl back again.

We never did find her, not even her bones, though the lake was dragged for her remains, and the entire village and its surrounding land searched for any trace of her person, living or dead.

My husband—driven to hate me for my inaction, and himself for having let Tara go—divorced me not long afterwards and left the village entirely. Within a year his mother called the house to inform me that he was dead. Poor health, she told me, some illness known to the family, but pain, I knew, had dragged him down just as our daughter had been to the end.

I stayed behind in the village, waiting to see the horses again. If they couldn’t be caught or driven out I’d see them gone, I told myself, and waited one afternoon, drunk, by the lake with a gun I’d acquired from one of my farming neighbours; whether I’d have been able to shoot accurately in that condition is another matter entirely.

Only one of the horses did I see then, standing over me after I sprawled, half asleep, in the grass. Its heat, the smell of rotting weeds and animal, awoke me.

I stared at the horse, into eyes of an intense blank that reminded me of the mad creature that had chased me across heaths as a child.

I didn’t dare touch the horse, not even to kill it. I couldn’t tell if it was the same animal that had taken Tara, or one of its kin; I only saw that its mane and pelt were wet, dripping on me as its face pressed close to mine.

“Leave me alone,” I wanted to say, or, “why did you drown my daughter?”

I knew that she was dead, by then, with the same painful certainty with which I knew she’d been born to me.

“What do you want?” I managed to ask, but the horse only stared at me, then slowly turned and moved away through the nearby shrubs, plucking grass with its flat teeth.

A horse was all it was, which I saw as it turned its back to me, its legs thin with age, but otherwise ordinary. Just an old horse that had gotten loose and would be soon home again, penned lovingly in for the night.

As I watched it go across the meadow it began to rain, and as I sat, drenched by it, I fell into horrible laughter at my poor fortune.

My mistakes.
