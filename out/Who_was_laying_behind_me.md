This happened when I was overseas about 2 months ago, but thinking about it still sends shivers down my spines. 

I was living in my aunts house with my cousin and other aunt and mum was there too… One day my mum planned on visiting her deceased family members graveyards, and I insisted on coming along with my mum and aunt. First we visited my grandfathers grave which went alright but I did feel a little uncomfortable, but then we went and visited my aunts ( mums sister grave ) which was really old with trees and bushes everywhere, I started feeling a bit light headed and sick but maybe I thought it was because of the sun. And at last we visited my another aunts ( mums elder sister) graves and her husbands( my uncles too ). And that place made me so uncomfortable, the people were so weird, the graves were so old. I started feeling really light headed and heavy. It was evening and got dark by the time we went back to my aunts home and a few minutes earlier , the cars tire has exploded. My aunt and uncle said this has never happened to them before. I got so scared because the sound was so loud. And as the moments passed by I started getting a really uncomfortable feeling and felt more sick. 

Later that night, my mum, aunts and cousins all got dressed up and we all went to the restaurant for dinner, we enjoyed and had fun but I couldn’t help get rid of that uncomfortable scared feeling. We went back home and I was so tired I fell asleep on the sofa while my cousin was laying beside me. My mum aunts, and cousins were in the bedrooms. I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night, it was 12, and I kept staring at my cousin who was still awake on her phone, I couldn’t help but kept staring at her for what felt like hours,and I didn’t even know why. Or was it really me who was staring at her? Or something inside me? When she noticed I was awake we started talking and laughing, started singing songs and recording our voices. At first we were listening to our recordings we heard a weird laugh, it felt strange but we didn’t give it much thought thinking it would’ve been some other noise that sounded like a laugh. We then continued recording and signing but this time my cousin recorded our faces too while we were singing with her front camera on Snapchat with the flash light on. It was a bit dark in the bedroom but my cousins phone was bright enough in which we could see our faces and the wall behind us. Just as we started singing in the camera, that’s when I felt something behind me. First I thought it was my imagination but then when I kept staring it got clearer, it was someone wrapped in  a white cloth, I could only see the head move a bit. I screamed my lungs of and jumped and ran to the bedroom where my mum and aunts were sleeping while my cousin rushed behind me. 

We told them what happened but they thought we were joking, I could swear on God that there was someone laying behind me, I’ve always been a coward but I’ve never been this scared in my life. It took a couple of minutes but they still weren’t believing me. That’s when my cousin said that she still has that captured video maybe it captured that face too behind me in the video. My cousin and I were too scared to look so she passed her phone to my auntie, when I saw the fear on my aunts face I went up to the bed I saw she was seeing exactly what I saw behind me and we both screamed and she threw the phone away. She got goosebumps and her eyes got watery, my mum then grabbed the phone while my cousin who was with me watched the video too my mum and cousin started screaming as they saw it too. I was so scared that I stared crying because this was my first ghost experience my mum was scared as hell. We turned the lights on all curled up in the bed. We started praying to God not knowing what else to do. We stayed up all night, I was begging the night to pass away and for it to be morning already. Nothing else happened that night but no one had the guts to go out of the bedroom till the morning. I still have that video on my phone but am too scared to watch it. 

Later on we showed the video to all the other relatives and family members they all saw exactly the same face. Even now I still feel someone’s presence when I’m alone but I try to ignore it and try my best to not be home alone by myself.
