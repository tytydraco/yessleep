\*\*\*Document Analysis: Letter from Elias Kaune

To \[REDACTED\],

At your request, here's the document you were briefed on. Please note that it's been five years since the subject went into hiding and this is the first indication we've had since then that Elias Kaune is operating out in the open again. Please treat this with the utmost level of discretion. We cannot allow Kaune to get wind of the fact that we're looking for him.

The following is Kaune's correspondence, penned from the remote slopes of Mount Emei (Emeishan, Sichuan province, China), it offers a glimpse into his exploits amidst the monastery's environs. Kaune's narrative reveals a (from his point of view) calculated pursuit of arcane knowledge intertwined with empirical inquiry. 

The letter exposes Kaune's obsession with the occult. In this letter, he describes in detail an event involving some sort of confrontation with an entity that apparently defies his ability to describe it, as well as the curious nature of his associate which he here refers to only as 'the Mink'. His candid admission of fear and exhilaration in confronting these entities hints at a complex psychosis, driving intellectual ambition and a perilous pursuit of forbidden knowledge.

This correspondence is pivotal in understanding Kaune's motives and methodologies, offering crucial insights into his increasingly audacious endeavors. As we continue to track his movements and unravel the mysteries surrounding him, Kaune remains a subject of intense scrutiny, the accounts of his actions posing significant implications for our ongoing investigations. Please note that Kaune is extremely dangerous, and if found should only be approached by a licensed Eschatologist of rank, or under false pretense.

Dear \[REDACTED\],



I trust this letter finds you well amidst your academic pursuits. I write to you now from Mount Emei, an island of serenity in a sea of clouds. It's nearly impossible to believe that a place as calming and beautiful as this could hide such a terrifying secret. If it hadn't been the entire reason for our trip here, I would have had a hard time believing it myself. I had been drawn here by reports of strange anomalies being sighted along some of the more inhospitable trails in could not resist the urge to come out myself to investigate. 

Of course, I brought the Mink with me. I am known in Asia, and the Mink is the perfect bodyguard, though they do draw quite a bit of attention if they aren't careful, but can all but become invisible when they are which I assure you is quite the impressive feat given their appearance. The Mink is very tall, over 2 meters tall. In your terms, the mink would be seven and a half feet tall with proportionate girth. It is also very hard to tell if the Mink is a man or a woman, particularly because they have the habit of wearing a mask. Of course, a person of this size and description would typically have a hard time avoiding the eyes of onlookers, but the Mink is very proficient, and thus they were *perfect* for this trip.

I digress.

The ascent itself began amidst a mist-shrouded dawn along a trail where a troupe of Tibetan Macaques observed our progress with what seemed to be a mixture of curiosity and disdain. Among them, Xing Xing, an elder one-armed matriarch of no small fame held court with an indifference to human endeavor. I am told she has such contempt for the tourists that she will reject all offers of food from them, unlike her brethren who frequently steal food. She is a woman after my own heart.

In my discussions with Li Wei, a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim with a countenance weathered by years of devotion, I subtly probed for information about the anomalies that have plagued these paths. "Strange sights," he murmured in his Sichuanese Mandarin, his voice a blend of reverence and concern. "Some say ghosts. Some say the trees turn to glass. I say I have heard music coming from the stones." He shook his head. I shot a knowing glance at the Mink who of course had no response other than to stare over the top of Li Wei's head, causing the man some visible disquiet. I apologized to the old man explaining away the Mink's size and muteness. This eased his distress somewhat but he paid the Mink very little mind after that. 

Presently, about midday, we came across the first of these anomalies. The Mink touched one of my shoulders with their large hand and pointed into the tree line. I left the pilgrims behind and made my approach. As I walked closer to the grove of trees that the Mink had indicated I saw what had caught their eye. A grove of dead trees which were made remarkable by the fact that they had been turned completely into a glasslike crystalline material, as if all the lignin and been stripped away and the moisture inside the tree solidified. I could think of nothing in nature that could affect a tree in such a way. I felt a thrill of almost giddy excitement run through me at the sight and made a note of it in my journal before continuing along the trail.

We encountered several more anomalies along the trail. Rocks that seemed to have melted and run like water before resolidifying though there were no signs that they had been heated. Shadows that appear to have been cast by figures that seemed not to exist though the air thickened where they should have stood. We found traces of blood on the stone which we processed with chemical tests that indicated the blood was human, but very, very old and yet refused to clot. In more than one patch of sunlight, I observed the growth of pools of ice where the dew had frozen despite the heat. As the patch of light moved, so did the ice. 

I investigated and noted each anomaly I found as thoroughly as the rudimentary equipment I was able to bring with me would allow and could find no natural cause for any of them. It was almost as though whatever force lay beneath the mountain had, in small yet subtle ways, been able to alter reality or, at the very least, the landscape around it. It was quite astonishing. I would recommend you make the trip yourself and see them with your own eyes, but I suspect that they're gone now since the responsible party has been... removed from the area.

It was during one such investigation, amidst the murmuring pines and the soft susurrus of prayer flags, that I stumbled upon the entrance to a grotto: a fissure in the rock, barely noticeable yet pulsating with an otherworldly aura. A feeling of dread and a sensation of tugging in the back of my mind drew me closer, like a moth to a flame. The pilgrims had spoken of this place in hushed tones, hinting at its significance without divulging its secrets. None, it seemed, had had the gumption to enter due to a perceived droning, which, according to their accounts, seemed to emanate from the stone within. I knew instinctively that I had reached the goal of my expedition, and I prepared myself for what was to come. I slipped through the opening quite easily, but the poor Mink had a much more difficult time wedging their prodigious girth through it. At length, they managed and followed silently as I unclipped a torch from my belt and made my way downward into the dark.

The ritual I had planned—a synthesis of occult knowledge and empirical method—was my key to unraveling this mystery. I laid out my equipment hurriedly. A sense of growing excitement rose in my chest as I made my preparations. Before me in the grotto, I heard the steady dripping and sloshing of liquid. It is interesting the tricks your mind can play on itself. My imagination was quick to interpret the dripping as that of blood dripping from the distant ceiling of the grotto with a steady and ceaseless cadence like the ticking of a great clock, and the sloshing being caused by some unfathomable beast below the surface of what had pooled from that oppressive drip... drip... dripping. I shivered and unclipped a torch from my belt and shone it into the darkness.

Fortunately, the light of my torch revealed the truth of my surroundings: an underground lake stretching out beyond the range of the beam. Above the lake hung a mist so thick that I almost believed I could cut it with a knife. I set up a small projector and pointed it into the mist. It shone ritual shapes into the mist, their outlines stretching into the darkness creating the illusion of infinite length. I arranged ritual candles made from red phosphorous in a semicircle behind me and laid out a selection of syringes on a strip of green velvet at my feet. (I am, alas a victim of cliche and melodrama even now.)   
  
I opened the book I carried in a pouch strapped to my leg, becoming aware once I did so of the droning the pilgrims had described. I had dismissed it earlier as a trick of a fearful mind and so my mind dismissed it. However, as I turned the thick pages of the book I became increasingly aware of it. Once I reached the particular page I sought, the droning rose to a crescendo that was deafening. I turned to look behind me at the Mink, who had their hands pressed firmly over their ears. I'm not sure why but this filled me with a sense of relief, and I realized that the droning had frightened me a great deal. I chuckled wryly and turned my intention back to the book, and the text of the ritual speech.  
  
As I chanted the incantations, the air grew heavy with anticipation. I sensed movement out in the darkness but when I looked for it my eyes refused to look ahead. Instead jumping to the side or down at the rock beneath my feet. As I read my gaze wandered out into the mist and I detected the faint stirrings of something moving through it and finally, I caught a glimpse. All at once the droning ceased and a familiar and terrifying shattering sensation shot through my mind and I felt the rock shift beneath me. The ceiling of the grotto seemed so much farther away, and the lake seemed to me to be so deep that it could not possibly exist on this earth. The darkness that stretched beyond the beam of the projector's bulb was so oppressive and took on the quality of the cosmos, and stars began to appear in its depths. I felt as though I stood on the precipice of infinity and the sense of scale defied all definitions. 

And there was something there. Moving silently. Its outline blotting out the stars. So large as to fill the oppressively empty space, and yet...

Small. Lost. Enraged, and...confused. And now trapped as the beam of the projector caught it and brought it forth into the light. Its form was impossible to describe, and I felt myself becoming sick with dread. Bile threatened to rise in my throat and my head pounded like a timpani. The sensations became so intense that I was forced to look away and the fear was so intense that I could taste it, yet I dared not move to run away. 

"I see you," I murmured, my voice broken, tinged with a mix of fascination and dread. The entity pulsed with eldritch power, its very presence warping reality around it. With practiced precision, I invoked the bindings, weaving threads of arcane power around it, by those threads I pulled it forth and tied it to the Mink.

The Mink themself fell to their knees beside me and their body contorted into a silent scream which regardless filled the cavern around us. They convulsed and thrashed, but remained kneeling before the onslaught of sheer eldritch might which they bore. They tore the mask from their head and turned their glassy eyes to look at me and I was struck by the expression on their dead face. My own fear grew more potent at the sight. The Mink had always born that rictus of painful asphyxiation with its cracked, swollen, and pursed lips, pale skin, neck muscles tensed, and eyes red and bulging from their sockets. The Mink was, after all a walking corpse.

But to see those dead eyes filled with fear was another matter entirely.

As the ritual reached its zenith, a primal fear clawed at the edges of my consciousness. The droning hum that emanated from the grotto, from the stone itself, seemed to resonate within my bones. I found myself numbed by that fear and frozen in place by it. It grew to abject terror and was overcome by the frantic rage of the entity as the threads I had woven tightened around it and drew it inexorably to the trap I had built...the Mink. As it fell into my servant the droning ceased and the fear abated and my eardrums beat rhythmically against the silence that now overtook the grotto. It was only when the projector's bulb burst that I snapped back to the moment and felt the siren call that had drawn me to this place shrink to a muted cry of captivity. 

The fear that had filled my body gave way to elation and I bent down to pick up a palm-sized stone from the floor of the grotto and held it up to my face. As I examined it it began to emit a faint white glow as it ever so slowly turned to glass. 

Now, as I sit under the pallid moonlight, the shadows cast by Mount Emei's peaks stretching like grasping fingers across the landscape, I reflect on the journey that has brought me here. The hunger for knowledge that led me down this path, and the power I now wield (albeit with power drawn from the Mink)—both exhilarate and terrify me in equal measure.

I trust this missive provides some insight into my recent endeavors. The road ahead is fraught with uncertainty, yet I am emboldened by the revelations unearthed in these sacred heights. May this letter find you in good health and eager anticipation of the discoveries that await us both.



Eternally yours,



Elias Kaune
