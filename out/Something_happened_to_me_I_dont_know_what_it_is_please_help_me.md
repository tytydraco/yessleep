**july 2nd <2021>**


It was 11:30pm at my garden house and I was getting ready for bed and I heard a fox, now this is unusual because where my garden house is there are no foxes at all. I went to check it out. I live in my garden house at summers and we have quite a huge forest leading in from our back yard and the fox howl came from where I recently planted strawberries.

I decided to sneak up on it and I wish I had just gone to bed.

As I got near a song started playing, it was one my great grandmother sang me when I was a child (and yes my great grandma is still alive she’s sitting next to me as I write this). Whatever this thing was it was stalking or looking for me for a while. I looked at the chilling creature from the bushes…

It had its eyes seemingly gouged out
Its mouth seemed torn into an impossibly wide form and it was smiling with a grin reaching its upper cheeks.
Its body was pale and bruised and torn with what seemed like brown liquid coming from it. The liquid trailed from over the fence which is how I assume it got in

It looked horrified as the creature stopped singing and let its smile go, the smile turned into a gaping hole and it started screeching stared at me and ran away. 

I thought it was over until…

**july 4th 2022**

I heard a growl and the same screeches this time, I have no idea why I went back to that place but I did. It seemed to urge me to come to it like it was calling to me.

I went.
I again wish I didn’t.

This thing was even more terrifying seeming more rotten and now patches of skin were missing everywhere. At this point I manned up came out of hiding. Same expression. I told him her it or whatever to speak and it just looked at me. Screeched and almost lunged at me but seemed like it decided against it and ran away. 

A week later

I was tired but it was a hopelessly sleepless night, I was expecting the screech. On que as I joked abt it over call with my best friend it came. My friend is quite a bit older than me and lives near the country house I live in so he immediately drove over and snuck in. I let him in. We went out to see tf it was and he got a picture. THEN IT SCREECHED AT US SEEMING IT KNEW AND IT LUNGED. We were terrified and threw a log at it to disorient it while we ran into his car. This year it was different more warped and sludge coming out of its eye sockets.
We ran to his car and it wouldn't start. Then we realized everything went silent and there was only darkness outside our windows. We opened the door and the air was breathable I realized appeared at the same place as my house used to be except it was empty then I blinked and it was back. I blamed it on adrenaline and terror. Anyway we went inside and ate baked potato until morning.
To this day I'm scared it will appear year and year after I'll keep you updated if it happens this year.
