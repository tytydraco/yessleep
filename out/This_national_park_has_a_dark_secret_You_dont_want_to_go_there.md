I used to go hiking a lot. I must be more cautious in the future. More respectful towards the woods and the creatures living in there.



It was a nice day, the sun was shining and birds were singing. I called my friend, Edward. To see if he would go camping with me. He said yes and we both agreed to go camping that night. I packed my bags and started my car. I picked up my friend and we listened to music and had an amazing conversation. 



Edward was funny and we had many things in common but he was rich. I don’t mean that it's bad to be rich but for him it was. It made him act like a piece of shit sometimes. Like he was entitled to everything and everyone must like him. That was one part where we differed. I tried to be as respectful towards everyone and anyone I’d meet. Edward was still a good friend of mine.



Edward talked to me about this folklore he had been interested in. It was about some creature called Pukwudgie. He told me that they are small creatures who try to lure people to their deaths. He also said that they look like trolls but have these spines in their back. Apparently they also used to be friendly towards humans.



It was an interesting conversation as I love folklore. It’s fun, mysterious and you can imagine it being real. Time flew by as we talked about different urban legends and folklore. It was fun and it made the camping feel really mysterious, like anything we talked about could show up.



We reached our destination. It was a national park and it was huge. We had been there before but we decided to go set up our tent and camping area in a different place than before. We wanted to see something mysterious. The first night we spent there went well. We sat by the campfire, talked about different things and had a really great time. It was like every other camping experience I’ve had with Edward. We decided to go to sleep and wake up early the next morning to go fish. 



That night I woke up to noises coming around the camp. I heard this sniffing sound, like someone was smelling our stuff. I also heard this weird noise that I can’t explain. It sounded like they were talking to each other but it was not English or any human language. There must have been like 3 different sounds. I thought that some coyotes came looking for food as we cooked and they could smell the food. I went back to sleep. I was woken up a while later by something scratching our tent. 



The next morning I woke up and got out of the tent. There were these tiny footprints all around the campsite and my cookies were eaten by something. That’s when I remembered the noises I heard.”Did you hear anything last night?” I say to Edward. “I heard something scratching our tent but I figured it was just a lizard or something,” Edward answered me. He didn’t hear the sounds before the scratching. 



We didn’t think of what happened anymore and decided to go fishing like we had planned. We hiked to the lake near us and we fished for a couple of hours. Edward catched a couple of trout that we kept. I swear that at one point I could hear the same talking type of noise I had heard the night before. I looked around but didn’t see anything. Our fishing came to an end and we hiked back to our campsite. 



On the way there I saw these small burrows beside the path. I saw movement in those burrows and it looked like a porcupine was sleeping in there. It had these spines on its back. The next second I looked it was gone. On the way back Edward slipped into one of these burrows and he got a cut to his ankle.



We got back to our campsite and cooked the fish we caught. Edward patched that cut up and then we ate. The fish was delicious. The rest of that day went by. We just sat at our campsite and enjoyed nature. We talked about that same folklore and Edward said that Pukwudgies talk to each other and also that they can disappear or appear at will. That raised my curiosity towards them. 



That night I heard the same noises but this time they were louder and sounded a bit angry. They scratched our tent more and it was bizarre. 



I opened the tents curtains and looked outside. There were these small creatures exploring our campsite. It was dark but the campfire was still barely burning, so it gave a little bit of light. I could see their silhouettes and some other features like they had small hands that had sharp claws. They looked like little trolls but had human-like faces. They also had glowing eyes that I could see. I saw so many pairs of eyes that I lost count. I got spooked and closed the curtains. Then I tried to get more sleep. 



“Our campsite is trashed! Someone has been here!” Edward shouted.  
  
I opened the tent's curtains and tried to see what's going on. I was not fully awake at that point so I couldn’t remember anything. I also got a little bit annoyed by Edwards shouting.   
  
“So what if it is trashed, we can clean it up.”I thought.   
  
He acted like there was some type of crime committed against us. I stepped outside and looked around. Everything was trashed. The campfire was stomped on and the wood pieces that hadn’t fully burned yet were thrown around the campsite. Our backpacks were all over the place. It looked like they were looking for something. We had a little bit of the fish left, so we ate that and then decided to go fishing again. 



“I gotta take a leak” I said to Edward.   
  
I looked around for a good place and decided to go behind this big tree. There were these same burrows around that place. I saw movement in the corner of my eye but as I turned my head there was nothing. 

Then I heard a big splash sound. I finished peeing and went back to fish. Edward was all wet when I got back.   
  
“You decided to cool off a little huh?” I asked him while smirking.   
  
“No, something pushed me in the water!” Edward said and he sounded really confused.   
  
We decided that it was going to be our last night there. We had to stay one more night as the hike back was about 3 hours and if we would have left at that point it would be dark halfway through the hike. I caught a couple of fish we could eat. They were pretty small but enough for the two of us.



We got back to our campsite and lit the campfire. We waited for it to be perfect for cooking and then cooked our fish. As we are cooking the fish I start hearing the same noises. They were coming closer.   
  
“Can you hear that?” I asked Edward.   
  
“Yes, what is that?” He answered me.   
  
I told him I have been hearing this noise every night and also told him the other stuff.   
  
“This must be connected to some kind of animal.” Edward said while being calm.   
  
Edwards' calmness calmed me down as I almost started running around the place. I was terrified of those things. Then we heard footsteps approaching. They sounded small but fast. I look around and all of a sudden we  are surrounded by these small troll looking creatures. They had spines in their backs and they had small hands with sharp claws. 



“These look like the trolls I told you about.” Edward whispered to me. I nodded.   
  
They came to sit around us. They tried to steal the fish but we didn’t let them. We acted like they weren’t there and just ate the fish. I gave them a couple of small bites to see if they would eat it. They did eat it and I was amazed. How was it possible that people didn’t know about this or they did but no one believed the folklore. 



As we are eating we hear footsteps again. This time they sounded like the creature was much bigger. Then we see a bigger Pukwudgie approach. He came to sit with us and said 

“disturb wood. Go away” It sounded really weird and not human at all. I figured he must have learned that while listening to people. The creatures seemed highly intelligent. 

“Sorry to bother you” I said.   
  
“We didn’t know this was your home” Edward added.   
  
The big Pukwudgie then said “destroy home. You must pay” I started to wonder how we could destroy their home. We just camped there and picked up every piece of garbage that we saw. Then it came to my mind. Edwards slip to the burrow. Those burrows must have been their homes. “I’m sorry. We will do whatever is right to fix this” I told him. Edward looked annoyed, like he believed we could beat them up or somehow just leave. That pissed me off. 



Then the leader of Pukwudgies spoke again “Do nothing. Give food.” And pointed at me. “Must pay” he said and pointed at Edward.   
  
“I’m not going to pay you anything,” Edward shouted.   
  
He was a little bit spoiled, his parents bought him anything he wanted and he could get off the hook every time. No matter what he had done.   
  
“Edward, you must do something. They will kill us otherwise” I told him with a shaky voice.   
  
He started rambling about why should he pay for anything. The Pukwudgies started to make some noise and it sounded really angry. Then they just disappeared.



After a while we heard footsteps and bushes rambling but it sounded human.   
  
“Hello there!” Some random dude yelled at us.   
  
I got scared and almost hit him. It was just another hiker coming to camp there. We talked to him for a bit and warned him to look out for the burrows and to respect the woods. Then we packed as quickly as we could and left that place. We were supposed to wait until morning but Edward demanded that we leave as soon as possible. He was scared to death as was I.



We hiked through the woods and did not see anything unusual. We were 20 minutes away from the parking lot when we heard the Pukwudgies speaking again. It was louder than previously and angrier too. They were coming for us or at least for Edward. Then we saw them appear right in front of us. They didn’t speak to us anymore, just stood there while angrily looking at us. We started running and I got through them but they stopped Edward. 



Edward was screaming very loud so I stopped and looked back. They were carrying Edward back to the woods. I saw their spines pierce Edwards arms and legs. I watched them carry Edward to a burrow. Then they just disappeared. The big Pukwudgie appeared to me and waved at me. I was too scared to go help Edward. I didn’t want to go with them. I wanted to live.



I got back to my car and drove off. I felt horrible for leaving Edward there and not helping but how could I even help at that point.  A few weeks went by and I saw a news article about people disappearing in that national park. There was a photo of the guy we saw just before we left. He disappeared too. I still think about why I didn’t help Edward but what is done is done and life goes on. Also what really happened to Edward, did he die?



 My last words are, always respect nature and every creature living in it. I know I have to respect nature even more if I ever want to go there again...
