I know what phantom limb syndrome is. I’ve researched it, and yes, it fits what I’m going through, but I know it’s deeper than that.

I survived a shooting a few weeks ago. I was shot in the hand, then the head. I should be dead. I think something worse might be happening.

I’m a teacher. After work I like to stop by a local game store next to the school, where it’s easy to piss away half an hour while the parental flood of traffic clears up. It’s nice, if a little too densely packed. I like the owners. Sometimes the clerk smiles at me. I hope she’s okay.

Last week I had my head buried in their box of Godzilla toys when the front door shattered. I whipped my head backwards and stared through the gap in the shelves at the bumbling, gibbering, wretched thing that had thrown the door open. 

That’s what he was; I have no reservations now. At the time I was worried that he needed help, that he was having a breakdown or had been hit by a car or something, his body lurched and cracked under his jacket, bits jutting out at angles like a sack full of nails. 

His left sleeve was completely empty, and the face under the hood was just matted hair. I thought he was dead. I thought he’d fallen from the sky and somehow pried himself off the pavement. I thought I saw guts hanging out. Maybe I did. Then I saw his gun.

It dangled from his right hand, twirled around his middle finger, the silver metal gleaming like a smile. His hand was mangled, with no index finger and the others misaligned, and I had only one thought: he’d never be able to fire with his hand in that state.

As if he heard, he sucked in a breath and stood up straight, uncoiling, the puzzle inside his body aligning with little cracks and pops. His fingers twisted and began to squeeze the grip, the middle finger jamming itself over the trigger. He sighed.

He was no longer jagged and lopsided; he was tall, lean, almost healthy. Only his face remained obscured by the strange mass of hood and hair. I was struck with a sudden understanding that he seemed, simply, incomplete. He was nearly perfect. Almost there. It’s too bad he was hollow.

I couldn’t bear to be in the same place as something like him. Couldn’t stand to coexist with that. He fired.

I recall the glass display case behind me shattering completely, rows of figures I’d wished I could afford splintering and tumbling onto the floor. Everything seemed to heave at once, as if gravity had switched its angle, and the whole place began to tip over. People thudded against the shelves, dove to the floor, and cried out. A model kit fell from the shelf above me and bounced off of my head.

I just moved. There was only one exit, and he was in front of it. I stepped right and charged.

I still vividly feel the sensation of an old video game, case and disc, being crushed beneath my heel. Like a bug. I rounded the corner and prayed he was focused somewhere else.

He was firing into the back of the store when I came upon him. The smallest, most desperate space remained between him and the shelves in front of the doorway — I took the chance. Sun beamed through where the door had been and made his back glow. I fit through. I could leave.

And yet: the gun was still in his hand, extended out from his body, blasting with force that made it bounce and shake, his gnarled fingers barely holding on.

It was easy. It was right. I stomped and skidded for a moment before leaping at his hand. His fingers gave way like paper and I took his god damned gun. I was in charge; I had the reins. I stuck it into his gut and pulled.

Again, again, again, I thundered. I had never fired a handgun before, and it leapt around like a wild animal in my hand. The case behind him exploded as blood poured out over it. Sick, brown, yellow blood. He shuddered with each one, body snapping back into that pointed, aching form. A low gag rose from beneath the hood and matted hair.

An eye appeared. It squeezed between the strands and looked at me. It wasn’t red, or bloodshot, or withered — it just looked like someone’s eye. The eye of any normal person. I suddenly couldn’t pull the trigger. Perhaps it’s better that way.

The eye shot down at my hand holding the gun. My knee exploded. He had taken my moment of distraction to kick my leg with such force that it had snapped backwards, and the pain broke my weak hold over the situation.

He whipped his hand back over mine and used the nails on his almost-hand in an attempt to pry the gun out of my grip. I held on like I’ve held nothing else. I drew strength from places I didn’t know I had. We struggled. I struggled. I was never cut out for this.

There was another blast and my hand erupted. I was instantly delirious with pain, my brain filled with fog. I stumbled backwards and held my hand up to my face. My index finger was completely gone. My blood poured out and mixed with his own on the floor. My finger was there, spinning in the puddle.

I looked back up. He had the gun. There was my life, in his hands, in the barrel, at the tip of his bullet. His eye betrayed no thought. I didn’t even realize I was dead when he pulled the trigger.

I lay in the puddle on the floor, leaking away. His shadow was gone. The sun peeked through the doorway and warmed me. I felt so hot. The blood from my forehead pooled into my eye and eventually I could not see. I felt the sun through my eyelids. As I lost consciousness, my only thought was of the school. It had only been a few minutes since it let out. God. I did not have the blood left to weep.

I woke up in the hospital. I still don’t know why I woke up at all. The doctors said that I had initially been on the way to the morgue, when they realized that I had started breathing again and the wound on my head hadn’t actually pierced through. 

In the end, he had vanished after shooting me. Witnesses said he limped away and headed down nearby alleyways. Detectives followed the trail of blood he left until it abruptly stopped, at the end of which they found two pieces of “organic material” belonging to as-yet unidentified people. Both showed clear bullet wounds.

Four people died. I was the only survivor with more than minor injuries. I guess my actions may have assuaged the situation a little bit, but it doesn’t sit right with me. In the days after, I spent my recovery time reading up on similar events that had occurred in the nearby area. Within the last month, there were two other shootings, both with an unknown perpetrator and one survivor each who had somehow recovered from extreme injury. One was missing a kidney; the other a section of their stomach. Their bodies were stable without both, as if they still functioned, to the confusion of local doctors.

On the day of the shooting, very shortly before I was picked up by the ambulance, both spontaneously began to bleed from where their missing organ had been. They both died shortly after.

My finger is gone. The wound stopped bleeding hours after I lost it. It’s barely healing, if at all, and the doctors expect my only issue will be adjusting to life with nine fingers.

It’s too bad, then, that I can still feel my tenth. I can feel it wiggling, flexing, pointing. I can feel it comb through matted hair. I can feel it touch warm flesh. I can feel it brush against cold metal. I can feel it pull the trigger. I can feel it every single time.

I know I’m not the only one. He’s out there. He’s not complete yet. That broken, jagged, hollow thing is looking for his next piece. And I’ll know when he’s found it.
