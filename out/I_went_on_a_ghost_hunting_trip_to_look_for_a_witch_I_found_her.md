They called her ‘Long Lanore’. 
According to legend, she got that name due to her torture at the hands of the townsfolk who accused her of witchcraft. Lanore was an unassuming woman who dabbled in medicine & recorded remedies she’d find using natural ailments found in the forest. Yet, the local deacon of the town’s church accused her of communion with Satan himself. So, for the enlightened folks that they were, they put her on a rack. She stretched her legs and arms until she fessed up to her sin. Lanore, however, maintained her innocence even in her pain. In the end, the town made up its mind and decided she was a witch because of what happened to her body. They claimed that no human could have their limbs stretched so far without being ripped from the body. By the time she was beheaded, he limbs sagged behind her like limp rope.

In the years since, townsfolk claimed that they had seen her walking through the woods. Impossibly long limbs striding amongst the trees with a small body and a head floating above the stump where the axe severed the neck. It is said that if she finds you, she’d stretch your limbs until they’re taut and snap off. Over the years, whenever a hunter or lost person was found dead in the woods, folks would say,

“Lanore got another one.”

The original town eventually became a ghost town due to the ever-expanding America, but the legend of Long Lanore remained. Locals who live close to the woods where this folk tale allegedly happened sold shirts, posters, mugs, & many other pieces of merchandise.

I won’t tell you which state I went to, or what town we visited to ask for directions. We shouldn’t have gone, and I prefer that none of y’all go out into the woods either.

Our show was called ‘What The Folk?’ and we’d go around state to state, county to county, asking and investigating folk tales & urban legends. It may have been a YouTube channel, but we took the show very seriously because we wanted to be taken seriously. We started in New York and worked our way down. Each season, we’d set up shop in a state and just spend the rest of the show going to each county to look into as many legends as we could. "The Jersey Devil" was our most-viewed episode on YouTube, garnering a total of 679,000 views. 

There was Sarah, Duke, Aaron, & Me. We were childhood friends, and we’d grown up watching shows like MTV’s FEAR, Ghost Hunters, Scariest Places on Earth & Destination Truth. We loved the paranormal because it was so much fun to look into another world & believe in things that might be outlandish. You could tell someone the legend of the Jersey Devil, and they’d scoff, but if you put that same person in the woods in the middle of the night with nothing more than a flashlight & a camera, you bet your ass they’d believe.

We were beginning Season 4 and setting up shop in the next state we’d chosen. The hotel we were staying at was shabby but clean, & more than comfortable. It was November, and the days were growing shorter than usual, not to mention the cold, making it tough on Duke, who had metal pins in his wrist due to an accident when he was in middle school.

“Why can’t we take a hiatus again?” Duke asked,

“The last season got the most views we’ve gotten in our entire time on YouTube.” Aaron said,  “We’ve got momentum!” 

Duke just nodded in agreement and kept typing away on the computer. Sarah was the one who went out asking about urban legends. Sure, she could use the internet, but she preferred to ask people in person. Her reasoning being that anyone online could claim to’ve seen a UFO or Ghost, but we live in cynical times, and anyone with a keyboard will say anything for attention  & irony. But whenever you talk to someone in person, you can tell from just the way they speak that they’re either lying or telling the truth.

At this time, I was checking all of the equipment to check the sound, video, & lights for the show. I took pride in making sure that everything worked; being the unofficial ‘tech guy’ was a job I’d started to enjoy. I was halfway through checking the walking talkies when Sarah walked in with a big smile,

“I got our next story!”

“Okay, shoot,” Duke said as he lay back on one of the beds.

“Long Lanore!”

Aaron looked up from his laptop and asked,

“Can’t say I’ve heard of that one.”

Sarah stood in the room, gesturing wildly as she told us the story, it's like she was in a pitch meeting and we were the investors. In a way, it was because once we're on a project, we're stuck with it for days until we have enough footage to cobble together an episode. 

Duke spoke up after she finished, 

"And you heard this from who exactly?"

She tossed a town brochure on the bed. It read,

'WELCOME TO ________, HOME OF LONG LANORE, THE WITCH!'

Duke looked it over as Sarah threw a beer couzie with a cartoon version of Lanore to Aaron and a shirt to me. I said,

"So, we're in a tourist trap sort of town?"

"Yes and no, I talked with a town historian and she said that the original settlement where this story took place is in the backwoods of ________!"

Duke sat up,

"So there's an abandoned old town from the 1700s out there?"

"That's exactly what I'm saying," Sarah added,

Aaron chimed in,

"Dude, the production value alone of a creepy ass village is gonna do numbers. You know how many times we investigated the woods, or an abandoned warehouse, or some boring ass haunted room? This shit has potential."

They turned to me for some sort of vindication, but I told them that wherever they went, I'd go. Right then and there, it was decided that the next big vid would be about Long Lanore, the Witch. Sarah did more digging about the legend and tried to find the precise location of the original settlement that was in the area all those years back. & The guys and I were doing street stuff, asking locals about the legend of Long Lanore. Every person gave a concrete answer and a story to go with it.

'I saw Lanore walking in the trees when I went hunting.'

'Lanore was peering at my window while I was sleeping. I live on the second floor of an apartment.'

'I saw Lanore climbing a tree at night; she was dragging something up with her.'

'That bitch Lanore killed my dog, Biscuit.'

'Folks say that Lanore only comes out at night, but I swear I saw her looking at me from the side of the road.'

And many others.

We rented a cheap off-roader, and I put our equipment into plastic containers. Our voice recorder, spirit box, EMF, cameras, spare batteries, flashlights, and so much other shit. Sarah returned to us with an alleged route to take us to where the site should be, and we waited for the sun to set. We drove out and went deep into the woods. It was freezing cold, we bundled up heavily, but the combination of cold winds and no windows in the off-roader made the November weather sting all the worse. 

For nearly an hour, we drove over twigs, dead leaves, and would occasionally get rocked by a stump hidden by moss. Duke stopped the vehicle as Sarah looked at the map. Aaron looked to me with an annoyed look and whispered,

"This episode is gonna be a bust."

I didn't say anything because I liked Sarah. She'd always been responsible for our best episodes, and she was like our rock of the group. Before I could say anything, Sarah spoke up,

"We should be close."

"You sure?" Duke asked,

"Positive."

We were running out of light, but we eventually came to a clearing as the sky turned a deep red with purple clouds streaking across the horizon. In the clearing was a dilapidated wooden palisade coated in moss. The front gate door was lying inside the palisade, and grass had overtaken everything except for the latch. We all stared in disbelief. There it was, the old town was still here, overtaken by nature, sure, but still.

"No fucking way," Aaron whispered,

"Told you," Sarah said to him,

Duke drove closer; the off-roader couldn't drive over the fallen gate, so we got out and began to set up shop. We lugged the stuff into town, walking over grass that was most likely once dirt roads. Even within the walls, the trees loomed over us, their dead limbs reaching out into the sky. We took the cameras and set them atop the perimeter of the walls surrounding the town, looking into the woods. The night vision worked like a charm because within a minute, we had footage of a herd of deer grazing in the distance, their eyes glowing in the night vision. 

We tested everything else, and all the equipment was in good working condition. We recorded a brief intro, got B-roll of the village, and then we just waited. It got dark quickly, and it somehow got colder. The moon hung over us, illuminating our surroundings. It was perfect for the show, but if we didn't get something recorded, it'd just be a pretty-looking filler episode. However, finding this little town in the woods was a pretty neat find on Sarah's part. I was on my laptop, monitoring the camera from within an abandoned Church. Sarah, Aaron, and Duke walked the perimeter trying to get EVPs and 'provoke the spirit' so to speak. I never heard them speak until they'd say something into their walkie-talkies. I sat crisscrossed on the floor because I had forgotten to bring a fold-out table and chair for the setup. The wireless connection to the feed was strong.

"Will." Aaron said, "Will you be getting anything yet?"

"Not yet," I said.

Late-night shoots, especially in the cold, could be brutal. I may have been 'indoors,' but it was musty, damp, and freezing. No amount of layers could really help. I lazily looked over the feed from the cameras, trying to fight sleep, until I saw what Camera 4 was picking up.

I was looking at a static shot of a treeline for hours; it was the same image I saw when I first set it up. Then, what I had thought was a tree began to shift and move. From the treeline, an enormous, thin creature emerged, its arms spread out, basking in the moonlight. But as I watched this thing stalking about, I realized that it was her. She was always here, watching us the entire time, waiting for us. Its body was small with gangly limbs, and a head floating above a torso. I couldn't get a clear look at its features from the grainy night vision footage, but her hair swirled about as if it were underwater. I picked up my walkie with a shaking hand and spoke,

"Camera 4, I've got something."

They radioed back,

"What? What do you see?" Sarah asked,

"Heading there now," Duke said,

"Wait!" I screamed, "Just wait! I...I don't know what the fuck I'm looking at, but it's scaring me, man. I just..."

The radio fizzled out, and then the feed of the camera died. I was left in the dark in the middle of a dark chapel. I tried to run outside, but that's when I heard Aaron scream out,

"What the fuck is that?!"

Then they all started to scream. I wish I could tell you I was a hero and rushed out of the church to shout at Lanore, chasing her off or distracting her. But I'm not that kind of person. I sat, paralyzed in fear as I heard the screams grow louder, I heard snaps, gurgles, and wheezing last breaths. When you're in the middle of the forest, away from any noise of the city, you can hear things in perfect detail. When it stopped, I still didn't go out there; I knew it would come for me. 

A shadow overtook the empty church. I turned around to find that she was there at one of the shattered windows. He severed head peering in with a dull, milky eye. It was as if, after all this time, no matter what happened to this place, the Church was still holy. She kept staring for what felt like an eternity until eventually it went away, letting the moonlight return to the room.

I let out a little cry of relief when she left, I'm not afraid to admit. I wanted to leave, but I knew she'd be waiting. My best option was to wait until morning. I sat on the floor of that old church for hours. It's funny, I was fighting sleep, and now, it was all I wanted. To my shock, the feed of the cameras returned. On Camera 2, there was a huge bonfire. I saw my friends lying limp in the flames, their limbs stretched to the point where they were dislocated and hanging by loose skin or completely ripped from the body entirely. Next to the fire was Lanore, dancing in the moonlight, he unnaturally stalky arms waving about with a smooth grace. Her hair wafted in the moonlight. 

She danced the entire night, until the flames died. When the sun came out, I returned to the off-roader and sped off. I don't care if I left the equipment behind; I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. The one thing I do wish I had brought with me was Sarah's map. I've been lost for two days now; the off-roader is out of gas, and I'm writing this from my phone. I called 9-1-1, but they've been unable to locate me. They occasionally call me to try and help, but I don't think I've got long.

This morning, I saw her staring at me from a distance, her gray, callous skin blending in with the bark of the trees surrounding her. 

I think tonight will be my last.

To Sarah, Duke & Aaron, I'm so sorry.
