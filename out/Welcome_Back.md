The evening started just like any other, with nothing seemingly different from the monotonous routine of my daily life. I brushed my teeth with the same worn-out toothbrush I hadn’t replaced in years. After rinsing my mouth with cold water, I headed to my room through the long, dark hallways of my grandfather’s house. The creaking of the floorboards was nothing unusual, but I still tried not to wake up my old, tired granddad.

The room where I spent most of my time was nothing special. In the middle, against the left wall, was a wooden bed. My feet touched the edge every time I lay down. A heavy, dark oak desk, accompanied by a chair carved with floral patterns at the top of the backrest, stood in the upper-left corner, between the bed and the window. The curtains had long been removed from the scratched and battered old window. Curtains, for some irrational reason, always made me uneasy.

After putting my glasses on the desk, I grabbed my checkered pajamas from the wardrobe beside the bed, changed into them, and laid down to sleep. I rarely had dreams, and when I did, they were fragmented, hopeless bits of boyish imagination or continuations of the day's events. I usually couldn’t remember much of them after waking up.

Unexpectedly, I fell into a deep sleep, the kind that makes you feel as though you've blinked and suddenly woken up. But something wasn’t right. I couldn’t see anything without my glasses. I reached for the spot where I instinctively knew they should be, but there was nothing—my hand passed through empty air.

I stood up, feeling uneasy, and jumped out of bed onto the floor. Instantly, I wished I hadn’t. Between my toes I felt some kind of warm, sticky sand, which clung to me like it wanted to turn me into a lifeless prop in some twisted play. I noticed something else, something that took my mind off of the weird surface I was standing on. My vision... cleared? I hadn’t seen this clearly since I was a child, before the accident that left my grandfather the only family I had.

As my eyes adjusted to this new environment, I grew no less disturbed. A warped landscape stretched before me, filled with that sticky substance, which I now realized wasn’t sand. A sickly green light illuminated the grotesque scene before me, casting long shadows from the finger-like protrusions that towered beyond my line of sight. I wasn’t the panicking type, but this was beyond anything I could have imagined in my wildest nightmares.

My heart raced, threatening to burst from my chest and leave me behind. That’s my biggest fear—being left alone, again.

The ground trembled, and with it came a horrible screech, a sound unlike anything I had ever heard before. I felt like I was losing my mind. I crouched down, gripping my head, hoping to block out the noise, but it only grew louder, as though it was living inside me. It became so unbearable that my body started to convulse and twist. Desperate, I began hitting my head, thinking it was the only way to stop the torment. It didn’t work.

Just when I thought my skull would explode from the pressure, everything went silent. Dead silent. I let out a tear, thinking that perhaps this nightmare was finally over. How naive I was.

Suddenly, I heard a whisper. I couldn’t make out the words, but I knew something tried to talk to me. The whisper grew into something far greater than I could comprehend, filling the air, the grotesque green light stabbing into my body like a thousand needles. I curled into a ball, trying to protect my eyes and ears, but this force wasn’t letting up. As it sliced through my flesh without mercy, I desperately tried to understand anything from the whispers, but it was futile. I felt like I was trapped in a cage underwater, powerless to stop my inevitable demise.

To my relief, the screeching stopped, just as suddenly as it had begun. I barely had time to catch my breath before a shadowy figure appeared before me, its shape concealed beneath a tattered black cloak. I stared at it without blinking, afraid to lose sight of it. A tiny flicker of optimism inside me hoped that this being was here to help me, to save me.

Once again, I was naive.

It laughed, a deep, harsh, and eerie laugh that sent a shiver down every inch of my body. For a few seconds, there was silence, and I stood frozen in place. It spoke. The words were brief and clearly malevolent, but I only understood one: “Run!”

The substance binding my feet to the ground released its grip, giving me a chance to flee, confirming the meaning of the word that the creature had spoken. Another mistake. I should have known it wouldn’t be that easy.

The first step filled me with hope, but the second snatched it away just as quickly. That disgusting sludge latched onto me again, this time tearing chunks of skin from my bare feet as I ran harder than I ever had in my life. The pain was beyond words, unlike anything I had ever experienced. It urged me to stop and give up, but the mere thought of what was behind me kept me moving forward.

As I ran, I watched parts of my body get left behind, my only chance of escape fading with them. When it became impossible to run, I fell to my hands and began to crawl. Again, the same torment. I wanted to stop, to give up; it would have been easier than what was happening to me, but I couldn’t. The creature’s words had taken over my body, and despite my screams and cries, I kept going until there was nothing left of me to move. With my legs gone and my arms torn off by this wretched place, I collapsed face-first into the slime, unable to move.

This wasn’t the end of my suffering, though. I heard heavy footsteps, but I couldn’t see them, which only heightened my dread. What I feared most quickly pulled me out of the sticky substance. With one final scream, which peeled away the skin from my face and much of my body, I looked up at it, sobbing. Beneath that cursed hood was nothing. No face. Nothing, except the stench of a rotting corpse.

The screeching returned, this time like the incessant whine of a broken machine. I was desperate. I begged for it all to end, for the creature to take my life. It smiled again, that same eerie, haunting smile. Its laugh, combined with the screeching, ruptured my eardrums, and blood began pouring from my ears. It spoke words that seemed to echo inside my mind; I didn’t need to interpret them: “Welcome back.”

A green light flashed in an explosion, damaging my eyes. Everything went blurry again. I shut them tightly, praying this wasn’t real. The screeching stopped, and I opened my eyes again.

I saw a round white light above my head and people in white coats surrounding me.

“Am I dead?” I asked them.

“You were, but thankfully we managed to bring you back,” an older man said, standing by my bed while removing his gloves.

The doctors told me I was the sole survivor of a car crash caused by my drunk father.

“Impossible... Is this déjà vu?” I thought in my head.

Hadn’t this already happened? I didn’t dare voice my thoughts out loud, fearing they’d keep me in the hospital. A strange discomfort settled in my chest, but my attention was diverted by the nurse who informed me I had a visitor.

The door opened, and there stood my grandfather. Overwhelmed with happiness to see him, I forgot everything and leaped into his arms. Yet, something was off. He didn’t speak or show any emotion. He had always been talkative—what was happening?

The nurse left us alone, granting us privacy after my accident. Everything seemed normal except for that horrible feeling in my chest, warning me of something.

My grandfather smiled—a dark, mocking smile—and in a voice that wasn’t his, he spoke:

**“Welcome back.”**
