I recently quit my job at a hotel as a night auditor due to the figure that came at night. As part of my job, I have access to the cameras as I'm supposed to keep an eye on things around the hotel. Such as making sure no one is breaking in or damaging the property. Well, the cameras also cover the perimeter of the building and every night without fail I see this thing staring at me. It only stays there for an hour or so until it drifts back into the darkness.

It keeps moving closer and a week ago on Monday was the very first night that it was standing right outside the glass door roughly around 4 am. It was on the far end of the building from me so I was still not terribly afraid as if it opened the door, I would have enough time to react and get out of there. However, my heart was still on edge.

I just sat there watching it, trying to make out what it was when its black eyes looked right at the camera, piercing my soul. I fell back into my seat and watched in horror as that camera had an error sign appear followed by, “signal lost.” It went black for a few seconds before flashing, “signal found.” The image flashed back on, and the figure was gone, nowhere to be seen. I checked the hallway cameras and luckily, I didn’t see anything.

More time passed and I was glued to the cameras, checking every crevice of the hotel that the cameras could cover, seeing nothing. I felt like I was in real life five nights at Freddy's situation, but I had no control over locking the doors. Well, I could have but then no guests would be able to get in or out and I’d definitely have issues with my boss. Luckily that night finished like any other, however I was even more joyful to see the sun glance over the nearby mountains. The next few nights I worked at the hotel; it was relatively boring. However, I had gotten so used to seeing the figure standing somewhere outside that I felt uneasy not seeing it at all, especially how close it had gotten the last time.

The nice thing was that I could access the camera which overlooked where I worked. I constantly hop between my desk in the back and the front desk when a guest needs help during my shift and both of which are in view of the camera.

A few nights back after this had all gone down during a shift, I decided to do some digging as there was no possible way I was the only one that worked here that had this issue before. I messaged a few of my coworkers that I had a good relationship with for their own personal experiences. The ones that worked during the day said they hadn’t had any issues at all, and the other night auditor said she personally never had any experiences but that Bryan who used to work here had mentioned he’d seen something similar. This gave me some relief as I didn’t feel completely insane, although intrigued I asked my coworker if she still had Bryan’s contact. She did and forwarded it to me. I reached out to him through text explaining it all out and also mentioned that it was fine if he didn’t reply at all as I understood I was just some random stranger to him.

It didn’t take long for him to reply after sending the message, although I wished he hadn’t as what he wrote struck a shock of fear down my spine. He wrote back, “If it has gotten inside already, just quit and find a new job.”

I messaged, “Why? What happened?"

He texted back, “Read the old notes I left in the staff spreadsheet back when I worked. It should be around July of 2024. Also don’t message me again as I don’t want any connection back to that thing.” He proceeded to block me, never replying to any of my other questions.

I waited until my next shift to go over the old staff logs. I went through hundreds of old notes by the staff with most of them saying things like, “So and so is requesting to move their room, check in early or late” and the usual hotel staff notes. I used the find words on the page to help narrow my search. After searching the word, “Figure,” I saw that it had a few responses pop up. I clicked on them and proceeded to read.

The first one read, “Strange figure has been snooping around at night. I’ve investigated but they always disappear before I find them.” The next few were similar until I read one that started out with, “I don’t feel safe anymore and alerted the police, as the figure/man has been standing at the door looking in for over half an hour. Something felt off. (Update) the man left before the cops arrived.”

It was interesting to see that nearly the same thing happened to Bryan back in the day. I was nervous to find out what happens next as I noticed the time had just passed midnight during my shift. I still had seven more hours until I could go home. With nothing but time on my hands I kept reading, “The man showed up again during my shift but this time they were inside the hallway. I was weary of calling the police as they weren’t so happy last time, I called them, and no one was there so I didn’t.” That's all that was written on that staff note.

The final one on the subject before the notes went back to normal hotel information being passed from shift to shift was, “The man stood outside the door to the employee front desk office for 3 hours. I had asked through the door for the person to move or leave as I couldn’t open the door without hitting them and I got no response. I called the police but before they got there it left.”

I checked Bryan's employment record, and he had quit shortly after this event took place, not even giving a two week notice or anything. He didn’t stay long enough to see what happens in the end and it felt like I was the one who was going to do it. I quickly checked the cameras to see if I saw anyone or anything. Although, it was dead silent all across the hotel. We were only filled to thirty percent occupancy at the hotel, so it was a slow night. I glanced my eyes across the hotel cameras and then I saw my worst nightmare. The figure was inside the building.

It stood there in a dark space that lies in between the shining ceiling lights from above. My heart dropped. I knew that it was only going to get closer. I watched it intently, not knowing what to do as calling the police would be fruitless. I made sure the staff door was locked and as I sat down the camera over that part of the hallway where the figure stood was completely black besides for a white circle. I stared at it and double clicked it to make it enlarge. I checked the feed to see if the internet had cut out, but it was live. The white circle disappeared and reappeared in a split second.

I was baffled by what I was seeing and was wondering if I should check on the camera although I already knew that I was too scared to do so and would wait until morning when it was light. After the white circle flicked for a few seconds, I noticed something peculiar. It looked kind of like the white of someone’s eyes, although the pupil seemed to be pitch black, taking up the whole center. I was staring at an eyeball. Horrified, I sat there immovable as I felt my very soul being pierced through with that gaze.

The feed to the camera cut out as it had done before and it was then back to normal. The figure was gone. I didn’t know what to do. My next shift would probably be where it stands at the door, and I was not mentally prepared for that. The rest of the night was fairly normal besides a strange black and white cat that walked around the side of the building. It also seemed to be on edge, by how it kept glancing behind itself every few steps before darting off into the darkness. I was so ready to go home after that.

Although after getting home, when I was trying to fall asleep after my shift I felt dread building up in my pit. It was sunny outside, and I had light dampening curtains because of my job. However, I was too scared to draw them back, so I hopped straight into bed, covered my face in the covers and drifted off to sleep. In my dream all I could see was the white circle. My body was stiff like thick concrete, and I felt completely trapped. I tried to scream but nothing came out. Attempting to wake myself up I shook my body rapidly and that did the trick. However, only my consciousness was awake, while my body felt paralyzed. It felt hard to breathe, and I noticed my room was pitch black, even though I had left the curtains open.

I could feel a presence in the corner of the room, and I could see two white circles resembling severely dilated eyes staring at me. It then proceeded to deform and start crawling on the ground towards me. My heart was empty as it crawled onto my chest. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t do anything but stare at it. Scared to death I passed out and woke up to my curtains drawn and the afternoon sun rays resting on the bedroom floor.

I was so relieved to have that dreadful nightmare over as I never had felt that sensation before. Looking it up, it fit the perfect picture of a sleep paralysis demon and I’m glad many other people had experienced similar things. However, it still didn’t rest easy with me that I was going to work that same night. I dreaded it with all my being and felt like doing what Bryan did and just quitting. Although, I would feel bad for my colleagues that would get stuck covering my shift until they found someone to replace me. So, I decided to show up to work anyway, bringing a small pocketknife which I kept concealed. It added at least a little comfort.

Upon starting my shift, I did the usual opening shift tasks like cleaning and wiping things down and reading over the staff notes of the day. There weren't too many guests staying over at the hotel that night either which made me even more uneasy as that means there would be less people up and about. I’d much rather deal with someone yelling at me for something than whatever that thing was waiting for. Another hour flew by until it was 1 am and still nothing. I started to feel a little better about the situation and leaned back in my chair while pulling up a movie as we’re allowed to do what we want as they mainly need a warm body present to help hotel guests in the middle of the night. Anyway, I’m watching Parks and Recreation when I saw one of the cameras flicker. Pausing the show, I leaned in to see that it was the camera that was down the hall from the door I was behind at the front desk area.

I began trembling as I knew what was next and I watched that door like a hawk. However, it never appeared. I sat there staring intently until I saw another flicker on one of the cameras and it was the one in the office where I was sitting. The camera in that office is behind me and films the rest of the office. I felt as stiff as a board as I felt a cold presence behind me. The figure was right behind me. I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen, and my body didn’t move an inch.

I didn’t dare look behind me but there was nothing I could do. So, I sat there for a full hour motionless, that thing didn’t flinch an inch. Cold wind brushed against the hairs on the back of my neck that stood straight. It was as if it was the breath of the creature. The phone near the front desk began ringing. Wanting so bad to answer it I slowly began to move. I watched the camera as I did this to see if there was any movement from the thing. There was none. I continued to slowly swivel my chair while still keeping my attention forward, I stood up. Walking to the front desk I answered the call, and it was someone in one of the rooms asking about what time breakfast was. I answered him in the coldest voice I ever had as I couldn’t even pretend to have an ounce of joy. He seemed put off but didn't have enough time to say anything as I hung up.

Afterwards, I looked forward to the window and saw the reflection of the thing standing from the back desk that I had left with the cameras displayed open. It hadn’t moved an inch. I took three breaths, mustering all of the courage I could and quickly flashing open my pocketknife as I turned around. I saw nothing. The figure was gone, and I breathed a sigh of relief, however I was horrified to go back there so I stayed at the front desk until the end of my shift.

I went home, called my boss and quit. I mailed back my uniform as I don’t even want to step foot near that place again. I haven’t been back since, and I still have no idea of what that thing was. All I do know is that I won’t be the last one to experience that.
