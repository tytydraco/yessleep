The year is ‘95 , October    A very rainy day  
The busy hussle of workers coming too and from work soundtrack the streets of Tokyo, the drum beat of rain falling gives the busy street life almost an angelic quality to their voices 

It sounds oddly beautiful 

But for slainshin it’s not beautiful , a never ending reminder of a life of slight happiness , ripped away by the grim cards of life that he was dealt , dressed in black jeans , a hoodie and converse  kinda long but also shorter hair slicked beck and puffing on a cig 
He sits in the empty church pondering the events that led him to this moment 
 
“Hm, maybe I should go to the bar after this “ he says ,” provided I’m not bothering  like a piñata at some kids fucked up birthday party that’s ruined cus his parents didn’t get what he wanted for his birthday “

He gets up , grabbing his jacket and lazily throwing it on  “fuck it my family is gone and the people I thought were right by me dipped , scumfucks I’ll tell ya “

He ashes in the pew and rubs his hand over the jacket passing by the words “savage MC”

“I had it all “ he weakily  says , seemingly already accepting defeat , surely the biker gang mentioned on his jacket , his former biker gang , who brutally beat him for requesting to leave despite knowing the consequences for even breathing with the intention to say something like that would be at the bar , this situation only happened a week ago 

“ gotta do everything myself now “ checking his waist for his the knife he brought with him for protection. Turning one last time to look at the altar , head down and eyes weary  

The rain seemingly gets quiet , turning to see the door has been shut and there’s now a hulking figure with a stone dead face and a vest, jeans and boots his yellow stained hole filled t shirt underneath 

“Slainshin ,you ready to bring your bitch ass home now ?, you lucky the guys caught you a break , I was sure they were gonna make you extinct and  let their furry dressed gimp ,yanno have his way with your corpse ” 

Slainshin clearly not bothered and with the most dead face ,  “hm” “ I suppose you tracked me down with the help of that thing?  And it’s heightened sense for smelling bullshit , save your breath I got places to be “ “hell im surprised he didn’t crawl in your ass and just never came out with all the shit you spew “

a loud moaning can be heard, turning around slainshins eyes come upon the gimp , with a black ski mask and Dinosaur onesie  covered in rust colored stains 

“ I assume your going to the bar yanno to drink your woes away , surprised you aren’t stoned yet “ 

“I am , which is why I don’t wanna exact Revenge on “the gang”  just yet, you  bitch ass scum will have your Time to shine” 

Smiling with glee biker douche says “Gimp” 

Just then the Gimp springs behind slainshin attempting to grab  him 
Quickly turning, slainshin punches gimp in the face breaking the nose ,   With the force of a brick wall  biker douche suddenly hits slainshin  tackling him ,  keep in mind “biker douche”  a bigger while more sloppy fighter is beating the brakes off slainshin , now on the alter the Gimp howls In excitement , biker douche gets distracted 

Slainshin who was just picking his time takes this  knife out jamming it straight into the guys neck and tearing it across , killing him 

The Gimp whom is now screeching like a banshee charges at slainshin but is blasted through the head by a seemingly normal civilian 

“But that’s odd” slainshin remarks
“Civilians can’t carry guns in Tokyo “
The figure steps out the darkness revealing himself to be torio , slainshins childhood friend 
Currently practicing the  off duty  part of being cop 

“You okay ? “ torio remarks 

Yeah “ replies slainshin “ just a long day “

“ get out of here , lay low “ “I’ll call this in “ torio explains 

Slainshin leaves  back into the cold rainy and foggy afternoon , peeling a figure out in the road  dressed in a black dress that goes down to her thighs and a black leather jacket with a white expressionless mask and clumpy dirty hair falling in front 
A car passes by the figure and it’s Gone

Slainshin contemplates going to the bar but decides he’s gotta go home and tend to his injuries 

Entering his run down apartment that despite its incredibly grungy exterior is actually kinda nice inside , he goes in the bathroom staring at himself in the mirror , running his hands over his beard that’s  starting to grow back in 

 showering , he contemplates the life he used to have , the fake friends that showed him genuine love , those same friends turned on him and killed his family 

he’s throws some clothes on and cuts the patch out his jacket , grabbing a beer he swiftly downs it , before grabbing his gun he keeps in his bedside table , putting his hood up  and stepping out the door , walking out into the night, to the bar , to the same people that destroyed him , determined to finish what they started on his terms.
