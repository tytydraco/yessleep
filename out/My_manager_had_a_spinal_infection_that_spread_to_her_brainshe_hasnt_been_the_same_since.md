Hello r/nosleep, I am posting here to share my recollection of events that have left myself and several of my coworkers, frazzled, to say the least. As the title suggests, my manager had a spinal infection that spread to her brain causing immense swelling of her brain’s tissues. She was hospitalized in a coma for six weeks because of it. When she returned to work, all of us were very grateful for her recovery, especially once we saw that she seemed basically normal. Prior to her return to work, she sent out an email, warning all of us that she might be a little slow to get back to her normal production levels and that she may be prone to some odd behavior. Her doctor told her that it is completely normal for her to experience strange moments of subtle mania or depression, and that she shouldn’t be too worried about it, and to let the moments pass as they come, but to contact them if they get worse or prolong in duration.

For some context, I work as the sales manager in a major retail store selling musical instruments. I am the first person people contact when the typical ‘Karen’ asks to speak to our manager. My boss, Helen, is above me. She usually doesn't deal with petty sales but focuses on major shipping manifests, communicating with the higher-ups about sales projections and statistics, as well as interceding on our behalf to the powers that run this company. She is a wonderful boss and all of us, as I said earlier, were ecstatic she was cleared by the doctor as having a full recovery. 

That was all three months ago, before what my coworkers and I have begun calling her “brain-swell moments” started to happen. Helen insisted to us that her doctor cleared her. But as time went on, suspicion began to rise amongst our ranks in the sales team. Because of the nature of our collective experiences, we decided we needed more than professional help to diagnose what Helen’s problems really were. Reddit was our vote. 

The first “brain-swell moment” occurred three weeks after Helen’s return to work. Until this time, everything appeared just as it always has, relatively mundane, repetitive, work. She acted her normal self and even surprised us one Friday with a cake, thanking us all for our patience and support through her medical trauma. 

She was so proud of the cake she had made, “I spent all night baking the cake and preparing the frosting. I even watched a YouTube video about how to make fondant.” She said, slicing and handing out pieces of the baked treat to us all. It wasn’t myself who noticed it, but my coworker, Nathan, who saw what she wrote on the cake wasn't exactly correct. He pointed it out to me after all of us had devoured our portions gleefully, and it said, “We are grateful for your prayers.”

“She must’ve just slipped and wrote ‘we’ instead of ‘I.’ Her doctor *did* say she would have moments like this.” I expressed to Nathan, attempting to ease his worry. 

“I don’t know man, she never made mistakes like that before. Remember when Stacy misspelled a customer's last name on that order slip and like a hundred shipping labels? She made her reprint it.” Nathan said.

“Well yeah, but what she’s gone through has been life altering. Her brain will never be the same as it was before. Besides, she said it was her first time making fondant, she probably spent all that time making it, only to realize after the fact that she had the wrong words. I think anyone would be too tired to change it.” 

I really thought Nathan was making a big deal out of nothing. But I’ll admit, she was certainly not her usual self. The Helen I remember from when I first got this position was straightforward, exacting, and precise. She knew what she wanted and how to get there and she wanted to take us all along with her. Now she mostly seemed despondent, far-off and isolated. I would walk into her office, looking for a signature on some major order forms, only to find her gazing out her window. Her eyes, unblinking when I saw her face, legs twitching slightly as if she was about to fall asleep. Still, I chalked it all up to the spinal infection and brain swelling. Afterall, she wasn’t hurting anyone.

Until her second “brain-swell moment.” That one was recounted to me by our newest team member who has since found employment elsewhere. 

His name is Scott, and he is a naive eighteen year old who loves playing guitar. He started working for us just after Helen had gone to the hospital for “a fever, back pain, and muscle spasms”, the symptoms that indicated to the doctor her growing spinal infection. Scott didn't get a chance to see who Helen really was or how she actually conducted herself at work. He only saw the aftermath. 

On a Monday, in the following month after the cake incident, Scott came in for his late shift, noon until 8:30-9:00 pm. I was in my office and the rest of our sales team was either out to lunch or on the floor, four people including Scott. Helen had been on lunch when he clocked in. The time clock is by the break room, allowing young Scott a quick glance at what Helen was snacking on. He saw her eating, as he described it, “severely burnt popcorn. Black as sin with lots of little pieces breaking off as she ate. Looked like it was her first time eating a snack; she was making such a mess.” He had chuckled when he mentioned it to me. We shrugged it off as simple weirdness then he left to go fulfill his duties. 

A couple hours into the shift, when business was slowest, Scott did what he did everyday and began cleaning the products we had on display. When that was finished he would make sure all the guitars were in tune. We all knew it was an excuse to play at work, but I let it slide as he always made sure his work was finished before he did so. 

As he finished dusting off a nice antique Fender we had on display, he plugged it into a nearby amp, set the volume low and began serenading the empty sales floor with melodic vibrations. He was a talented kid, full of expression and creativity that showed when he played. That was another reason why I let him play during the afternoon lull. It was a nice break from the incessant pop music our bosses demanded we play over the speakers. 

I had leaned back in my office chair, enjoying the free concert when the music was cut short. I lifted my head and listened intently but heard nothing. A stray customer probably wandered in. Scott wasn't allowed to jam while customers were here, that was probably it\*.\* I just went back to my work.

A moment after I refocused on my paperwork, I heard Scott howling. His shrieks reverberated down the hallway into my office. I jumped up from my desk, knocking my chair over, and ran down the hall to the floor. 

When I got there, the screaming had ceased and Helen was straightening her shirt while she marched past me down the hall into her office. Scott was standing in the corner of the floor by the guitars, pale as a ghost. I didn’t notice until I got closer that his shirt was covered in vomit. He had brown bile mixed with black chunks all over his torso. 

“What happened Scott? I heard a lot of yelling. Where is everybody?” I said taking notice the sales floor was void of anyone save for us two. 

He stared at the space Helen last occupied before she had disappeared down the hall. After several moments he responded, “She…she…” 

His eyes began to well up. He closed them, shook his head, pushed me aside and walked purposefully out the door. He never came back to work. 

I couldn’t piece together what happened with the evidence I had at the time. Was Scott drinking and got sick on the job? Did he have an anxiety attack after getting in trouble with Helen? But why would she have been mad? She never got mad before. I didn’t think a brain injury would make someone hate music that much. It was probably just one of her episodes I told myself as I began cleaning up the mess. I put the fender back on display, thankfully there were no fluids on it, and went to the supply closet to grab a mop, bucket, and some gloves. When I came back and started mopping I saw some beetles had already begun crawling all over the fresh vomit.

“Where the hell did you come from?” I knelt down, picked them up, and threw them away. “Disgusting.”

Scott texted me that night that he quit. I called him in response to the text which I know is annoying, but I had to figure out what happened. 

He, surprisingly, picked up. 

He said he was in the middle of playing when he felt her hands slide down his shoulders towards his chest. He froze for a moment, then whipped his head around to look at who was touching him. 

“She was glaring at me man, she looked wicked fucking mad. But at the same time, she was…grinning.”

“What do you mean, grinning? I thought you said she was angry?” 

“Her eyes looked angry… and…red, like she had smoked way too much weed, or something. But her mouth was smiling, like really big.” I could hear his shudder through the phone.

“What happened next? Did she say  anything to you?” 

Static answered me. I had begun to think Scott had hung up when his voice came through, “She spoke to me but I didn't hear it.” He said with finality, quickly, like it was difficult to say.

I paused, “What?”

“She spoke to me. But I didn't *hear* it.” His emphasis confused me. How could someone speak to someone without them hearing it? 

Scott continued, “She said ‘We have dreamed of your presence.’ I thought she was messing with me, but when I stood to face her…She was looking right through me.”

“What are you talking about?” I insisted. 

“She just stood there, man, shaking and staring at me. But it looked like she was looking past me, or at something right behind me. I wanted to leave but I couldn't! I felt too afraid. Like if I told my legs to move they wouldn’t have listened anyways.” 

“What the fuck…?” Was all I could say. 

“She kept repeating that sentence again and again and again. She must’ve said it over a hundred times. But Jack, her lips weren’t moving,” he made a sound that seemed like he cut himself off, “Then she fucking puked on me man!” He continued, “Why did it take you so long to get out there?” 

“I came as soon as I heard yelling, Scott.”

“I don't know man, it felt like a long time. Her puke too, it was…it wasn’t normal.” 

“What do you mean, ‘wasn’t normal’?”

“It had beetles in it, Jack. Fucking bugs!” 

How could she have done any of this? According to her, the doctor said ‘mild manic and depressive episodes may occur.’ How does any of this fall under those categories? What did Scott mean by she spoke to him but he didn’t *hear* it? Why did her vomit have bugs in it? I realized then that I had to contact her doctor. 

“Jack, I gotta go to bed, man. My back is killing me and my legs are twitching.” Scott interrupted my spiral and my eyes grew wide. 

“Goodnight Jack.”

Scott hung up before I could say anything further. And he hasn’t returned my calls or texts since that night.

From what he told me, he was starting to have the same symptoms Helen had.

Reeling from the implications of the conversation I just had, I barely slept.

I couldn’t keep myself from dwelling on it. I had resolved to call her emergency contact tomorrow morning. I would inform them of Helen’s relapse in condition and, hopefully, they can take care of her. 

The next morning, after looking through some paperwork, I couldn't find *anything* for an emergency contact for Helen. She did tell me which hospital she went to though, I thought maybe I could contact her doctor directly. I stole away into my office and left the lights off and the blinds drawn. I wanted to make this call privately. After a quick search online I found the number for the Neurology department of the hospital she went to and gave them a call,

“\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Clinic, Neurology Department, how can I help you?”

“Hello Yes, my name is Jack S\*\*\*\*\* and I am calling on behalf of my boss Helen \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. She was recently discharged from your department after a spinal infection that had spread to her brain. I was wondering if you could connect me to her doctor?”

“I can’t allow you any of her medical history sir.”

“I know that. I don’t need her medical history, I just…”

“Sir?” The receptionist prodded.

“I’m sorry. Helen has just been acting very strange, to put it mildly, ever since she has come back. I just would like to inform her doctor. I don’t want her condition to worsen.”

The receptionist had me leave my information after I recounted what had transpired and said she would tell Helen’s doctor I called. 

“This type of behavior isn’t typical. I would suggest bringing her to an emergency hospital.”

When I had left my office, Helen was just coming into work. She was coming down the hallway to our offices when I stopped her and asked if I could have a word. Once in her office, I asked her about what happened with Scott yesterday. 

“Oh, yeah.” She chuckled, sitting down in her chair and gesturing for me to sit across from her. I refused her invitation, thinking it would maintain the seriousness of the situation. 

Shrugging off my stubbornness she replied, “I had an exotic snack that my cousin had sent me from her trip overseas.” She leaned forward and whispered, “They were chocolate coated beetles.” She covered her mouth and giggled like a schoolgirl. I winced. “They’re totally edible! My cousin said the locals there enjoy cuisine like that all the time. It just didn’t agree with me. I meant to apologize to Scott, poor kid, but I was too nauseous to speak. Rather than throw up all over him again, I just walked away.” 

To say I was taken back was finite compared to how I actually felt. How could she pass this off so easily? “Helen, I called your doctor’s office this morning and they said you should be going to an emergency room right now.” I sternly looked into her eyes, half telling half pleading with her. 

“Oh pfft. I’m *fine*. I promise Jack. I swear it was just the weird snack. I’ll tell you what, if I vomit again, in the next week, I'll go back to the hospital, okay?”

She didn’t vomit that week. Or the week after that either. In fact, she acted so normal it was almost suspicious. Was I reading into this too much? Making a mountain out of a molehill? Vomiting after a traumatic brain injury is definitely a sign of further or continuing damage, but could it have been as simple as a weird snack? This flirted with the line of concern. But after all, you can lead a horse to water…

Nothing happened with Helen after that for another month. She came in at the regular time and conceded to leaving early the first two weeks after the vomiting incident. She even sent an apology and gift card to Scott. I told you she was a thoughtful boss. 

Just when I, and my coworkers, started to believe we could add the craziness to our backlog of ‘entertaining work stories,’ Helen had another…moment. This time the swelling seemed to have been at its greatest thus far. 

Helen had been working all day that Thursday, much longer than her prescribed five hour days for three months to “allow time for readjustment.” She clocked in with me at six in the morning for the first shift. Managers clock in early then leave around 2:30-3:00 pm depending on work load or how long their lunch takes. She spent the whole day in her office. And after periodically checking on her throughout the day, I didn't see any evidence of her acting strange. I left around the typical time, but noticed Helen’s car was still in the parking lot. I had decided it wasn't worth the effort and that she knew her body better than anyone. I got in my car and drove home. 

Five hours later I got a phone call from Stacy, one of our sales team members. 

She was in hysterics, “Jack!” 

“Stacy what's wrong?” 

“I don’t know what the fuck just happened but Helen needs some *help*!” She cried.

“What happened? Wait, are you and Helen still at work?”

“She was there when I left 20 minutes ago.” 

By that math she had been there for around *fourteen* *hours*, nearly triple her recommended work time.

“She insisted on double checking our sales history for the time she had been gone to make sure it was ‘up to snuff’” Stacy mimicked Helen’s voice.

“Why-” 

Stacy cut me off, “I went into her office after we had shut down all the lights and wrapped up for the day and Jack…” Stacy took a deep shaking breath in an attempt to calm herself, “When I walked in there she was squatting on her desk barefoot, staring at her hands. Her entire body was vibrating! The whole place was a mess with papers and manilla folders, broken glass. And it *reeked*. She didn't seem to notice me when I walked in, but when I looked back at her after looking at the mess, she was…*glaring* at me!” Stacy cried again. 

“Jesus Christ, what?”

“I know, I know, it sounds crazy. But Jack, she was smiling at me too. Her eyes looked *so* angry but her mouth was in the biggest smile I had seen on her face since she brought that stupid cake she made.” 

“What happened next? Did you say anything to her?” 

“No, she shouted at me and said, "Didn't your parents teach you to knock, you little cunt!’ and started throwing shit at me!” 

“Oh my god! I’m so sorry Stacy. Are you okay?” 

“Yeah, I’m fine. She didn’t hurt me or anything. Just scared the shit out of me, that's all.” Stacy seemed to be calming down some. “Her eyes too. They were *extremely* bloodshot.” 

“Jesus Christ. Okay. Is there anything else you can remember?”

“No, that was all that happened.” 

“Okay, well thank you for contacting me. I’m sorry she did that to you. I know her doctor said she would have some ‘moments’ but I didn’t expect anything like this. Why don't you take tomorrow off, ok? Is Helen still at work?” 

“Okay Jack, Thank you. I don't know, she was there when I left.” 

“Thanks again for calling Stacy, I’ll go back and see if she's still there.” 

I am ashamed to say that it took me much longer than I would like to admit to go back to work. I know that I should have gone as soon as I hung up the phone with Stacy but I was just too scared. I didn’t get paid enough for this, nor was this in my job description. Still, my parents raised me better, taught me to be compassionate and patient with people as much as possible. To always lend a helping hand if and when I am able. This was on the border of my abilities and far past my willingness. 

Eventually I mustered up the nerve to go back to the office. To my shameful thankfulness, Helen wasn't there. I went inside and saw nothing out of the ordinary up front in sales. However, her office was a warzone. Papers were strewn everywhere. Her desk, decorations, writing utensils, framed family pictures, were thrown and shattered all over the floor. Even her ceiling light had been ripped down and broken. And the smell, the air itself seemed thick with a rancid stench, as if I had walked into a steam room filled with cattle. 

All of this is unsettling at the least, but what cemented me in my resolve to get Helen to the doctor was scrawled on the underside of her desk. Written in a reddish brown mixture, that was the source of the stench, was the phrase, “We have awaited your arrival.” 

I couldn’t smoke a joint big enough when I got home after that. I called out of work the next day, a Friday, allowing me time to reflect on what was going on and to contact my coworkers over the weekend. Those conversations are what led to this post. If anyone here knows what could explain Helen’s behavior, please let me know. I am at a loss for what to do.
