I write here on the events that transpired last month. I hope through this testimony I can provide the context for you to understand why I was compelled to take action on that fateful day.



It was a Saturday, but for me it also marked the beginning of a precious few days of freedom. I work as a consultant, you see, and had just finished a project that had consumed my life for the preceding three months. I was set to start on another project the following Tuesday, so I considered how best to spend my time. I realized that the carnival had been in town for the past few weeks and this was my opportunity to visit it.



I spent the first half of the day gorging myself on various foods and riding the many attractions. As the sun began to set, I wandered into a street lined with small stalls. Most were selling a variety of trinkets and merchandise, but one stall in particular caught my eye. It was painted in stripes of red and white and had a sign in full carnival lettering proclaiming that one only needed to step right up to have a “once in a lifetime experience in multiple dimensions.” Typically, I would not be lured in by such garish displays, but the young man staffing the stall had noticed my interest and insistently beckoned me over.



“Would you like to experience the fourth dimension?” he said with a grin.



“The fourth dimension? So you allow me to travel through time?” I replied.



“Ah I misspoke, we allow people to experience \*a\* fourth dimension. Time is a possible fourth dimension, you see, but we can also add another spatial dimension instead.” he said.



I simply stared at him. 



“Sorry, I’m used to talking with others who live and breathe this stuff. Let me try to explain it more simply: a line is a one dimensional shape, a square is a two dimensional shape, and a cube is a three dimensional shape, yes?” he said.



“I think I see it now, so if we’re adding another spatial dimension, a four dimensional shape would then be a cube with an extra dimension added to it?” I said.



“Precisely! We call it a hypercube. It is hard to describe and would be impossible to really see in the three dimensional space that we live in. However, here we can give you a glimpse into what living in four dimensional space could be like.” he said.



“So is it some sort of VR experience?” I asked.



“Ah, unfortunately that is impossible. You see,the image projected onto each of your retinas is only two dimensional. Your brain interprets the two dimensional images from both of your eyes to perceive depth and  thus creates the perception of seeing in three dimensions. There’s simply no way your retinas can convey what four dimensional space would look like. Instead, we’ve created these.” he said as he held up two small metallic cylinders, “They go on your temples and stimulate your brain directly, sending images directly from our simulation of four dimensional space.”



“Fascinating! And what will I be viewing? The hypercube?” I said.



“No, no, nothing as dreadfully boring as that. We want you to experience what life would actually be like in four dimensional space, so we’ve simulated a small four dimensional town with four dimensional AI inhabitants for you to interact with.” he said, beaming with pride.



I asked a few more questions about the experience, namely focused on the price. I knew that the simulations that he was describing, even normal three dimensional ones, were exorbitantly expensive. But the man insisted that the experience was free and explained the stall was being operated through the research wing of the tech conglomerate Cobalt Engineering. They needed more data from real-world participants before figuring out how to commercialize it. Mollified, I agreed to try out this “dimensional experience” and the man led me through the back door of his stall. This opened into a plain room with a reclining chair in the middle, a coffee table next to it, and a few server racks placed against the right wall. I sat in the chair as he began wiring the cylinders to one of the server racks.



“These racks are enough to power the simulation?” I asked. I had imagined something much bigger.



“No, no. These simply power the transmitters.” He said as he motioned to the cylinders, “It takes quite a lot of processing power to generate four dimensional graphics and transmit them into your brain. The simulation is far more computationally intensive and happens at a datacenter a few miles away. It’s quite a sight, five stories high and the size of a city block.”



He walked over to me and placed the cylinders on my temples. They seemed to stay in place through no mechanism I could determine, perhaps magnets? 



“When you are ready to exit the simulation, simply mime pulling the cylinders away from your temples. The cylinders won’t be visible in the simulation, of course, but the computer will interpret that as the exit command and shut down the transmitters.” he said.



I practiced the movement without actually touching the cylinders, and he nodded in affirmation. 



“Are you ready to begin?” he asked. 



“Yes,” I said. And then everything changed.



I had the sense that I was currently in a house of some sort, but it looked like a mess of geometry. An object that I could vaguely make out to be a chair *flowed* in several different directions at once. I walked over to it and attempted to settle into it and felt a strange sensation, as if I was being enveloped by a particularly fluffy weighted blanket. Looking around, I saw a fair number of other objects that I could not guess the purpose of, but they all shared the same incomprehensible geometry. Even though the transmitters were making me feel and see in four dimensional space, my brain could not fully comprehend it.



Movement drew my attention to my right as I saw an object with more curves entering the room. It also had the same sense of geometrical wrongness but it also seemed to be constantly moving in a way that none of the other objects were even while it stayed in one place. I couldn’t take my eyes away from it. 



“Dad, you were supposed to pick me up from blox practice! I had to walk all the way home.” it said in a whining feminine voice.



I realized with a start it was talking to me! This was one of the AI inhabitants the man had described and it seemed to think I was its father. I looked down at my own body and realized it too was in the same state of constant movement as the other inhabitant. 



“Are you not going to say anything? I’m going to be late for my study date with Andrew.” it said with an angrier tone. 



I started feeling overwhelmed. I couldn’t interact with this… thing like it was a real person, it was too alien. I briefly took another look at the room and then reached up to my temples and made the motion I had practiced, and suddenly I was back in the plain room. I breathed in deeply and tried to relax. 



“That was… that was…” I tried to get the words out.



“Weird, right?” the man said. “Yeah, it took me a while to get used to. If you don’t practice with it, it’s easy to get headaches just walking around.”



“The inhabitant I encountered seemed so… realistic.” I said.



“Yep, the simulation we run is the highest fidelity in the world currently.” the man said, beaming again. “It’s about three times as computationally expensive as the second-best. There’s even been some ethics complaints about the AIs potentially being conscious, if you believe in that sort of stuff.”



“Why do you need something that realistic to demonstrate four dimensional space? I would think that even a simple simulation without inhabitants would be enough.” I asked.



“Ah, but that’s because you’ve only experienced the first part of our demo today! You see, we don’t want to just demonstrate what it would be like to live in four dimensional space, but in five dimensional or six dimensional or seven dimensional space as well!” he said.



“And the simulation helps with this how?” I asked. 



“Well, unfortunately trying to do the math on rendering four dimensional space is already quite difficult for our engineers and our current computational capacity.” he said, gesturing at the server racks. “Even trying to imagine what five dimensional space might look like would give even our brightest minds a headache, let alone trying to model a single five dimensional object. But if our simulation of four dimensional space is realistic enough and we run it for long enough, we figured out that the inhabitants would get curious about five dimensional space on their own…”



It dawned on me what he was saying.



“You’re hoping that there’s someone in your simulated four dimensional world that’s like you! Who wants to experience a higher dimensional space, so they create a simulation of five dimensional space and you can then try out that simulation to see what five dimensional space would be like!” I said.



“You’ve got it! Except not hoping so much as running the simulation until it occurs. The simulation can be run much faster than real time so within a few hours of starting it, we’re pretty much guaranteed that someone inside the simulation will have created it. And then, of course, that happens recursively. The four dimensional researchers run the simulation for long enough that the five dimensional researchers simulate six dimensional space and they run that simulation for long enough so that the six dimensional researchers simulate seven dimensional space. That’s where we’ve hit a wall because our simulation can’t handle any further recursion than that.” he said.



My brain started making connections and I stared at him in horror. “So the four dimensional inhabitants believe they’re real… and the five dimensional inhabitants believe they’re real…”



“Yes, the ethics complaints I mentioned earlier. I’m not really a philosopher so I can’t speak to morality here.” he said with a shrug.



“No, that’s not my concern. Or it is one of my concerns but… you’ve created a machine to simulate a higher dimension, just like every simulation of yours does. Doesn’t that point to it being probable that we’re simply in a simulation of three dimensional space by two dimensional beings? And they’re in a simulation of two dimensional space by one dimensional beings?” I said. 



The man laughed. “You’ve certainly got an imagination! But no, what you’re describing wouldn’t be possible.”



He shuffled around in the back of the room for a moment and came back with a paper and a pen which he put on the coffee table next to me. He drew a line on the paper.



“This is one dimensional space. It can only exist on a single line. Perhaps a much longer line, but the line has no real width. It’s impossible for really anything to exist in one dimensional space.” he said, and then he drew a square on the paper below the line.



“This is two dimensional space. While there is width now, there’s absolutely no height. Even a single cell of yours, while it looks flat in a microscope, still has a height of a few dozen micrometers. Imagine any sort of energy source traveling through an organism. Without height, how would that work? It would be fully flat. So we’re quite certain there’s no such thing as two dimensional life. Thus, to your concern, there’s no lower dimensional life that is simulating us to get to experience higher dimensions.” he said.



I felt slightly better. I was slightly troubled at the plight of the simulated four and five and six dimensional inhabitants, but my existential fears were lessened.



“Are you ready to experience the higher dimensions?” he asked.



I contemplated saying no as the confusion from the previous experience still rattled me, but I was too curious now. “Yes” I said and I plunged back into the fourth dimension. 



I was in some sort of lab and again an impossible moving figure was in front of me.



“Are you ready to begin?” it asked in a deep male voice.



I realized that I had been placed in the exact moment the five dimensional experience was to begin and so before I got cold feet I said “Yes” again in a small voice and was pushed into the fifth dimension.



Again, I got the impression I was in some sort of lab. Strangely, I felt less disoriented going to five dimensional space from four dimensional space than from the normal world to four dimensional space. Things here seemed even more abstractly geometric but once everything in your field of vision was already sprouting infinite prisms, those prisms having their own prisms didn’t seem quite so jarring. I felt like I had taken a bad batch of drugs as the shapes started swimming in front of me.



Again, a voice asked me if I was ready to begin and I realized that if I confirmed I would be sent into six dimensional space. I became aware that my stomach was protesting and would not take the insult of seeing another set of impractical polyhedrons. While I was still quite curious what the higher dimensions looked like, I had seen enough for one day. I closed my eyes, reached up, and made the motion towards my head. 



Opening my eyes, I was slightly shocked to realize that I was not yet back in the real world but was rather back in four dimensional space. I suppose it made sense that the motion would be the same for each higher dimension and I would simply have to perform it again to drop back into three dimensional space.



As I was about to do this, I noticed that the room now had a second being in it, and the two four dimensional beings were having a conversation.



“So you’ve realized you can recursively simulate six dimensional space by first simulating five dimensional space and waiting until the five dimensional AI inhabitants create a simulation of six dimensional space?” one said. 



“Yes, precisely!” the other replied.



“Hmm, fascinating. But, then, a thought experiment. Is it not possible we’re in a simulation of four dimensional space by three dimensional beings?” the first being said.



I waited in anticipation. Would these beings realize they were being simulated now? Or would they simply think it was a fun thought experiment? 



To my surprise, the first being laughed. “You definitely have an imagination! But no, you see, life in three dimensional space is impossible. Three dimensional space has width, height, and depth, but no bledth. Every cell, even a plant cell, while it looks like it has no bledth in a microscope, still has a bledth of a few dozen micrometers. There’s no way that life can exist when everything has a bledth of 0.” 



This was the moment I began to panic. I made the motion at my head again, and was suddenly back in three dimensional space. Before I could get my bearings and stop him, the man had already pushed the “TERMINATE SESSION” button on the server rack.



“What… what happens to the simulation when that button is pressed?” I asked.



“It simply resets the simulation. We don’t want to waste computational resources.” he said, “I hope you enjoyed the experience! Feel free to take a minute here to catch your breath, I know it can be a lot. I have to go back to the front and see if I can reel in a few more participants.” 



He walked out the door leaving it slightly ajar, and looking through the gap I could see that there was already a woman waiting at the stall. Thoughts reeled through my mind. What if she was a two dimensional being? And how many minutes did we have left if she experienced the higher dimensional simulations that she came here for, only to return to her dimension where another “TERMINATE SESSION” button waited? 



I couldn’t risk it. At least if I put in a little setback, it might buy us some more time. A few more seconds in two dimensional space, perhaps, but that could mean a lifetime or two for us here. So yes, I, Justin Rayes, am guilty of arson, property damage, and involuntary manslaughter. But it seems a small cost to pay to save us all, at least temporarily.
