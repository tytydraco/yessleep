Unfortunately, I couldn't track down any druids, Vudu queens or even a crystal toting hippy. But when I returned, I didn’t go alone. I brought my older cousin called Mike, who I guess will have to do as back up for now. Cousin Mike was originally first in line to take over the pub. The only reason I got it rather than him was because he “didn’t want the responsibility.”



After hearing the thing from the basement make its debut. with that sickening imitation resounded from behind the door of living quarters, I screamed. Then I ran all the way out to the carpark, got in my car, and drove straight to cousin Mike’s house. Driving down the country lanes with tears in my eyes and a pounding heart. It’s a miracle I wasn't in an accident. I left all my stuff behind at the pub and showed up at Mike’s house with nothing but what I was wearing.



After I pounded his door like a police officer, he opened the door to me very confused. Then after his eyes scanned me and he realised the state I was in, his eyebrows furrowed in concern. 

“What happened to you?” He asked while ushering me inside. I attempted to explain as I stuttered over my words. Then I cried some more while sitting on his sofa, whole body shaking like I was freezing. Eventually, I just showed him the previous post I made. He read over it and I watched him grow increasingly disturbed by what I’d written. When he was done he looked up from my phone and stared at me like he was trying to figure me out. 



“Are you fucking with me?” He finally asked, looking a little angry. 

I shuffled uncomfortably on his leather sofa. “What do you mean?”

“...Do you remember my sleep paralysis?”

“Yeah, from when we were kids, years ago. Why?”

“Because this is eerily similar to what I used to hear when I had sleep paralysis. Y’know when I lived there for a bit as a kid. Then once we moved I stopped having it.”



Mike had night terrors and sleep paralysis all his life. I had seen him bolt upright and scream in the middle of night many times as a child. He used to scare the shit out of me. And he’d talk in his sleep. 

“If you’re trying to be funny I don't like it. I’m not in the right state of mind for it.” I scolded him. 

“No, I promise I’m being serious.” I could tell by the sincerity in his voice and face that he wasn’t messing with me. Not this time anyway. 

I shook my head and wrapped my arms around myself. “All my shit is back there. What am I gonna do?”

“Just stay here tonight, the place can survive one night without you. Do any of your employees have the key?”

I nodded. 

“Well message them saying there's a family emergency and they can run the place for the night while we sort things out. We can go to my dad’s and ask grandad.”

“Oh I don't think asking him about this sort of thing will be good for his dementia.”

Mike bit his lower lip as he thought about it, before nodding in agreement. “Yeah actually…” There was a sad moment of silence between us before Mike finally broke it. “You just sit there and watch some TV and try not to think about it for a minute alright. I’ll make you a tea.” He got up from the sofa and walked into the adjoining kitchen. 

I turned my attention to some talk show on the TV while Mike potted about in the kitchen. Hearing the kettle boil gave me an immense amount of comfort. 



My lovely bar staff were very understanding about the whole situation and ran the place for me for a bit. I felt terrible leaving them to fend for themselves. Laissez faire management isn't my usual style. I discussed with them that I might not be back for a few days and they decided they were happy to run it for me until I came back. Lying to my staff and shirking work made me feel like the world's shittiest pub owner. But Mike comforted me by telling me stories of how when Grandad first bought the pub, back when he was a younger man in the sixties, he sometimes got so hammered he had to be carried to his bed upstairs by his own patrons. That made me feel a lot better. 



Mike and I asked around the family. Gently trying to get them to say if they’d seen or heard anything weird in the basement or the pub itself. They all said no for told us the usual ghost stories we’d heard hundreds of times. 



Aside from my youngest Aunt, called Tara. Auntie Tara is less than a decade older than me and she babysat me a lot when she was a teenager. 

“Well actually, when you were about ten, and I was babysitting all of you, I went down in the basement to steal a bottle of something because my little hoodlum friends and I were gonna go get drunk in the field later that night. Well, I went down there and everything was fine, I didn't feel any dark energy or whatever.” She giggled over the phone. “But as I walking up those steps, the old twisty ones, something wet grabbed my ankle and tried to yank me down.” She said the story in all seriousness without her usual giggly way of speaking. She finished off the story but I wasn’t really listening and I passed the phone to Mike. My mind was elsewhere in that moment as I tried not to cry from the horror of it all. 



Tara’s story lingered in my mind that night as I lay on Mike’s sofa. Until I eventually slept. I say I slept, it was more lying in the dark trying to convince myself nothing was in it. I didn’t manage to convince myself no matter how logical I was. I had to resort to having a YouTube video essay about some weirdo on the internet on the TV, so I didn't have to sleep in the empty dark silence of Mike’s living room. 



Lucky for me Mike also worked evenings so he was able to take me back to the pub when, after three days of hyping myself up and researching demonic mimics, I felt ready. Mike himself isn’t religious or really spiritual in any sense. But I think he has good intuition and has a feeling of safety that follows him. Which some people have described as a “good vibe” or an “aura”. He has a punky and hippyish way of dressing that lends itself well to his personality. He might not describe himself as a spiritualist, but he’s the sort of person you’d take with you on a ghost hunt, if you understand. Odd things are often drawn to him. He’s also quite lucky. Which is maybe why he decided not to take the pub and let it fall to me instead. 



Twat. 



When we arrived at the pub, I spent some time gazing up at the old brickwork and the hanging baskets I’d accidentally let dry out. I put on what my grandad would call “a brave face”, standing tall and putting my shoulders back determinedly. I had convinced myself I was going to re-enact the scene in every horror film where the main character goes back and fights the monster in a symbolic metaphor for overcoming trauma. Although I didn’t really have any unresolved childhood trauma so I didn’t know what this monster was meant to symbolise. 



Before going inside I stared out at the sea at the end of the road. It made me feel more at ease. Although, the novelty of the seaside wears off more quickly than I thought it would. One notable thing about this seaside town is that it doesn’t follow the usual pattern of coastal communities in the North Kent region. Because usually…these towns are shitholes. Most of them are packed with DFL’s (Down from London) for a few months in the summer. Then in the colder months they decline into roaming grounds for marauding chavs on bikes. Until said chavs can find work on the pier again in summer. Usually in this part of the world there’s a lot of drug abuse problems and unemployment. 



But in this town it’s always quiet and peaceful. It is admittedly mostly pensioners. I rarely see a younger person. I remember there rarely being other kids around when I came to visit as a girl, even on the beach. A sandy beach in the summer ought to be packed with children, but here it hardly ever is. 



I looked over at Mike, who gave me a reassuring smile as I put my key into the lock. The click it made as it turned made me come out in goosebumps. As soon as I opened the door my stomach lurched and I was worried I was going to throw up. Definitely wouldn't be the first time someone threw up outside my pub. But it seemed uncouth for the landlady to be doing so at 10am on a Tuesday. 



I followed Mike inside watching him as he wandered around the bar, running his hand over the wood. 

“Feeling out the space?” I joked. He smiled and rolled his eyes. 

“Can I smoke in here?” He asked, already taking his tin out of his pocket. 

“Not if it’s of the herbal variety. Go smoke it in the garden please…” I waved my hand for him to take his illicit substances outside. “Wait Mike, do you think it’s a good idea to do drugs before facing off against a supernatural entity.”

“Yes.” He nodded with a smile, heading toward the beer garden without a second thought. I followed him. 



As he smoked, I sat next to him on the bench and tried not to look up at the windows of the living area. I was frightened I’d see a face. Instead I looked over the plants in the pots lined up along the wall and last night’s unemptied ash trays sitting on the tables. 

“By the way, I’m not here to face off against anything. I’m just investigating and helping you get some of your stuff.” Mike clarified. 

“Oh yeah sure. I didn't mean it like that anyway. Thankyou by the way.” I nudged him. 

“No problem.”

“Are you scared?” I asked, when I secretly wanted to ask, are you as scared as I am. 

He shrugged. “A bit.”

I tutted and rolled my eyes. “Always so bloody calm about everything.” I got up from the bench and looked out toward where the sea was again. I folded my arms over myself feeling a chill in the air. “Y’know I’m gonna do my shift tonight, and ask the locals if they have any clue about what could be haunting us.” 

“Have you got a priest nearby? He might be the person to ask.” 

“There’s always a church somewhere close isn't there.” I said absentmindedly, staring out at the water, watching the waves, which were grey like the sky, sway with the wind. I found myself swaying along with it slightly. 



Suddenly, Mike grabbed my wrist. I snapped out of my staring contest with the sea and looked down at him. His mouth was parted in a shocked O shape and his eyes were wide. I hated seeing his face contorted like that. It reminded me of how he used to look when he had night terrors. That wide eyes terrified stare, seconds away from a bloodcurdling scream. But this time there was no mum, dad or granddad to come running down the hall, turn on all the lights and save us from whatever Mike had seen in our doorway. 

“What?” My voice trembled as I asked. I resisted the instinct to turn around and see what had shocked Mike so much. I kept my eyes on him, his terror radiating off him and getting to me. Suddenly, his expression softened and he finally took his eyes off whatever he’d seen. “What?!” I asked again impatiently. 

He looked up at me. His mouth moved but he seemed to struggle to find the words. 

“I just….I saw a hand. O-on the window. But it was like…wet.” He managed to say. 

I had to laugh. “What do you mean wet?”

“Look, it left a mark.” He pointed forward.  

I finally turned to follow where his finger was pointing. Sure enough, imprinted on the glass, was a wet hand print. 



This should have made my blood curdle. But instead it made me angry. I was tired of this. I didn’t care who this moistened bastard was. I just wanted my pub back. I made a frustrated grumbling sound before marching over to the door and throwing it open. Angrily, I stomped my way through the pub, my steps thudding against the carpeted floor, and into the living quarters. Mike rushed after me trying to drag me back. I shrugged him off and threw the door to the living quarters open. I yanked it so viciously it bashed into the wall, leaving a dent in the plaster. 



“Right!” I yelled, staring down into the dark of the cellar. “Listen!” I demanded of the creature. Then I continued. “I won't bother you if you don’t mess with me, understand?” I left a silent gap, I don’t know what I was expecting, maybe three knocks, a growl, a creepy hello again. I wanted some kind of acknowledgement. Even if the response terrified me, I’d like to know what the monster thought of my proposal. But the darkness stayed still. And it stayed silent. “When I come down there to get something, if you keep making creepy noises I’m going to buy a speaker and have it play high frequencies or some shit, 24/7! Okay?! And I’ll…I’ll hire a priest if you don’t leave me alone.” I could hear my Karen esque tone and poorly planned threats echo through the cellar. 



My face had gone red from shouting. I stood at the top of the stairs shaking with rage and adrenaline. I felt proud of myself for standing up to the cellar creature and turned to Mike for a reassuring nod. Instead, his face looked pale. He didn’t even seem to notice me turn to look at him. His stare was fixed on the steps to the cellar. I followed his gaze. Along the steps one after the other, were several wet footprints. My eyes followed the footsteps down into the darkness. 



The stillness of the dark was disturbed. Something was moving around in it. My eye made out a shape. As they began to adjust to the dark, I began to see it clearly. Waiting there, at the bottom of the steps, shrouded in darkness and barely visible, was something grinning at me. Its mouth was wide and wet. And smiling up at me, were two rows of numerous, tiny sharp teeth set behind pale grey lips. The lips shone with moisture. 



The creature and its smile didn’t move for a while. Just stayed grinning in the dark. Breathing. Waiting. Then I saw movement, as slowly, one slimy blueish hand, which was webbed between the fingers, began to stretch itself out from the dark. It paused in the air for a second and my mind tried its hardest to decode what would happen next. Then the hand rested gently on the step above with a quiet wet thud. The creature froze again. Waiting. Breathing. Ready. So very alive. Not a ghost or apparition at all. 



Both Mike and I seemed to be in agreement that if we moved, we’d trigger some sort of prey drive in the creature and it would chase us. We both knew it was down there in the dark, waiting to pounce. We stayed still. Matching the motionlessness of the monster. There was a tense fresh stillness in the air that felt as if it was going to snap. The air was also full of a damp smell. Perhaps like seaweed on a hot day at the beach. 



Slowly, the hand began to recede. As the monster moved I saw the light catch its wide jet black eyes. We waited to see what it would do next. Personally, I thought I was about to die. That it was pulling back before it pounced. Playing with its food. I expected the creature to suddenly dart up the stairs and then drag me down to wherever it came from. Like it tried to do to Auntie Tara. Instead it did something I never could have anticipated. 



The creature began to whistle. As it receded further down into the darkness a tune I vaguely recognised went with it. It was some kind of slowed eerie version of a sea shanty. It made my arm hairs stand on end. What I suddenly noticed, which made it all the more unnerving, was how it wasn’t moving its mouth to whistle. That stayed grinning. I couldn't figure out how it was doing it. The old stairs creaked as the creatures climbed down them. I watched as it left more wet footsteps in its wake. The wide grin was the last thing to go as the creature slowly disappeared into the darkness. But I could feel it still there, just out of view. Smiling. Waiting. I imagined the creature slinking through one of the doorways. Maybe the one I’d first heard it mimicking me from, and then go further and further down into the cold damp earth. Down to wherever those corridors ended. Or maybe it lingered right at the bottom of the stairs just out of view obscured by the absence of light. Waiting. 



It was Mike that moved first, dragging me out of the pub with such urgency it hurt my arm. Once we were out onto the street I finally got a look at him. I’d never seen him so afraid. I was almost guilty. I didn't feel the same. In truth I felt calm and a little dazed. Although of course I was freaked out, in the end the monster didn’t attack us, so maybe that was its way of saying yeah sure I’ll leave you alone. Then just wanted to show off his whistling skills for some reason.



“I don’t think we should come back here.” Mike shook his head.

“What? What about my stuff?” I heard myself mumble. 

“You stuff?” He turned to me, furious. “You just…there was a fucking monster in the basement and you’re worried about your stuff!” 

“No. You’re right. Sorry.” His fear was starting to rub off on me now. Especially as we started walking further up the road. I was starting to realise that there was something that drew me to the monster. I was reminded of how I almost opened the door as a child. And how I’d almost done it again the other day. I always felt the need to get closer, to know more. I didn’t like that at all. The thought that my instincts could be numbed, affected, contorted. It was more horrific than the monster itself. To know you want to run, to know you should scream, but you can’t. It didn’t bear thinking about. 



Mike stopped in front of a bench and sat down. I watched him take a deep breath and then look up at me. There was pure terror in his eyes. His eyes were dark brown like my grandmothers and that made them look all the more wide and afraid. 

“Do you remember how people used to say there was a ghost of a pirate that sang sea shanties in the pub?” He asked, his entire body trembling. His words trembled too in a way that made him seem so far from the calm and stoic older cousin I knew. In his expression I saw the little boy with night terrors again. 



My jaw dropped as I realised what he had said. “You think it was the creature.” I whispered, almost afraid to say it too loud. 

Mike nodded that he did indeed think the creature that lurked in the basement and mimicked me, had been mimicking a pirate too. 

“Well I’ve been thinking as well.” Mike began, swallowing before he spoke. “About the Victorian lady and the little boy who giggles.”

“Oh my god.” I gasped, putting my hand to my mouth. “But then how do you explain people saying they see them?”

“Maybe it shapeshifts. Or drunk people lie. You often find little spooky things like that have some truth in them and it gets twisted. Maybe people really did hear these things. And it was the sea creature thing mimicking people. And then they just lied about seeing things too because…well it's a good story.”



Whatever has made its home in my pub basement has clearly been there long before me, mimicking people who’ve been dead for centuries now. I keep going back and forth about whether this thing is my enemy. A demonic entity. Malevolent and to be exterminated. Or whether it's a creature like any other, without human morality, incapable of evil and acting as it naturally does. I wish I knew what it wanted. Maybe it was just hungry.



Mike and I are going to have to speak to our grandfather. Dementia or not I’m convinced the old man knows things he’s been keeping from us. We should probably also ask around the town. Maybe speak to the local church. I’m not really sure where to go from here. But I’m glad Mike saw the creature too. I can’t imagine carrying a weight like this alone. 



I no longer live at the pub. For now. I come and I work but I’m never there alone, not even in the bar area. I really should tell my employees about the cellar but I suspect I’m already on thin ice with them over all the absences and poor management. I’ve not even been here a month and already I’ve made a terrible impression. I will say though, no one seems to have heard or seen anything when they go down there. This thing just wants to freak out me and my family for some reason. 



I’ve also started having night terrors. Like Mike used to. I see the creature in my doorway at night. 



It’s that smile that disturbs me most of all. If you’ve ever seen the old animated Alice In Wonderland movie where the cat’s last thing to go is his smile. It was a bit like that. But instead of singing about the mome raths, this creature’s mouth doesn't move at all as it whistles eerie tunes. It makes sounds, but it doesn’t speak.
