I have nothing to report to the police, and if my suspicions prove accurate, then confronting him will only make things worse. The only realistic option at this point seems to be a panic attack, so I want to see if anyone else has gone through something similar before I resort to that approach.

The first signs were (relatively) mild. Darren (boyfriend) always seemed to sniff Jordan (son) every time he got near. It didn’t appear to be sexual; he looked more like he was taking in the aroma of wine before sipping. I don’t know if that’s worse than a gasp and a deep shudder. Confronting Darren seemed like the most uncomfortable suggestion imaginable, so I let it go.

I’ve been far more uncomfortable since.

Two days later, we had soup. Jordan always pours more than he eats, so I thought nothing of it when he pushed back his half-empty bowl. I took it as an act of service when Darren said, “don’t worry, I’ll clean the table.” I didn’t realize how much of a relief it was to share housework until I only had to do half of it.

So I gathered the remnants of the dishes and brought them into the kitchen. Clearly, Darren didn’t expect to see me as he poured Jordan’s portion down the front of his shirt.

I pretended that I didn’t see him, and he pretended not to see me slink away. 

Last week was the first time I caught Darren with the book. He asked if he could read Jordan a story before bed. It felt odd, because *I* hardly read to him anymore, but I wanted to believe it would be a chance for positive bonding time. A chill settled over me when Darren closed the door after going into Jordan’s room. Again, it wasn’t overtly inappropriate, but it made me extremely uncomfortable. Most of us actually just roll through unsettling behavior, because we’re hardwired not to rock the boat. Nine times out of ten, I would have swallowed my discomfort – but that tenth time is when my child’s wellbeing is on the line. I hesitated for a few seconds, then opened the door.

I could tell that Darren was irritated by my disruption. He quickly put a small, black book in his pocket. “Never mind, Champ,” he smiled at Jordan. “It’s getting late. I’ll tell you about it some other time.” He got up and walked past me without making eye contact. When we went to bed an hour later, we chatted as normal and pretended the incident never happened. 

Things got very strange two days ago. I walked into Jordan’s room to say good night, and was surprised to find the door again shut. Jordan likes to sleep with it open. My stomach turned over as I went inside, knowing who I would see there. Darren was standing over Jordan, offering him a cup.

The look on Jordan’s face told me that he didn’t like what was going on. I approached to get between them and hug my son as Darren withdrew the cup. But he wasn’t quick enough to take one other item off the nightstand before I saw it.

It was a syringe half-filled with blood.

I wrapped my arms around Jordan as Darren grabbed the syringe and left the room. When I went back into the hallway, I discovered that he had gone home.

I didn’t see him most of the next day. I didn’t reach out to him.

Then he called me. I hesitated, but picked up on the fourth ring. “I’d like to come over tonight, stay by your side, and talk about it in the morning,” he offered by way of greeting. 

I opened my mouth to say ‘no,’ but a voice in the back of my head told me that it would be worse if I upset him. I convinced myself that Jordan would be better off if I knew where Darren was all night.

He came over, and true to his word, stayed away from Jordan and just curled up next to me in bed. It almost felt normal again. I almost convinced myself that I had been overreacting.

Almost.

I told myself that I could stay up all night, that I would know exactly where Darren was as long as he had his arm wrapped around me. Losing one night’s sleep was an easy price to pay. I felt awake and alert. 

I looked down to see that Darren’s arm was gone. I had no idea how long I’d been asleep. I was out of bed and on my feet before making the conscious decision to move. Darting as quickly as I could to Jordan’s room without making a noise, I paused with my fingertips on the knob, tense about what I might find inside, wanting and not wanting to open it all at once. 

I turned and pushed it open.

I sighed with relief when I saw Jordan by himself on his bed. 

My breath stopped when I noticed Darren asleep on the floor. He was curled up by the nightlight. 

I took three silent steps toward them, pausing as I decided what to do next. 

I didn’t want to wake Jordan, and *really* wanted to keep Darren undisturbed. 

Suddenly, an object on the floor by the light caught my eye. 
	
It was that little black book he’d been hiding from me earlier.

I hadn’t realized just how much my hands were shaking until I lifted it. I read the first page.

It was all gibberish. I took Mandarin and Arabic in college, and I can sound out most Russian words. This language didn’t look like any of that. Flipping through, I could see that the entire thing was written this way – hundreds of pages containing thousands of words. The symbols repeated often enough so that it was clear this was some sort of internally consistent code that made sense to Darren. Fingers trembling in the dim nightlight, I silently prayed that Darren wouldn’t wake up as I turned to the final pages. I had to see if any part of it was readable, but couldn’t risk leaving the room in search of better lighting while Darren stayed behind with Jordan.

The last page was different. It looked like a series of interconnecting lines that seemed vaguely familiar. I flipped it upside down.

And then I understood.

The numbers “1913” were written at the meeting of two lines.

That’s my house number.

I was looking at a crude map. Our home was in the center of it.

I flipped the book around again and looked at the cover. It had no title; instead, it was embossed with a symbol that I don’t know the meaning of, but have seen before. [It looks like this](https://imgur.com/XsGFfsP).

I picked up Jordan (fortunately he sleeps like a log) and hefted him over Darren, who I left sleeping on the floor. I brought Jordan into my room, closed my bedroom door (it doesn’t lock) and put him into bed with me. I’m writing this now. 

If Darren is capable of aggression (I don’t know if he is), then confronting him is the last thing I want to do. I don’t have any family or close friends in town; I know we could stay in a motel, but then what? We’ll eventually have to come back and face Darren.

Is this all in my head? Has anyone faced something like this before, or does someone recognize this behavior? Am I overreacting? Any (immediate) advice would be appreciated.
