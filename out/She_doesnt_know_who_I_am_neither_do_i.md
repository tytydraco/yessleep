There's this beautiful blonde 5, 3, girl. She doesn't know who I am but I know everything about her.
She starts her day (5:30 am) very slow by just laying in bed for a good 30 minutes. Then she showers and goes out the door. I don't know where she goes after she left. I'm not allowed to leave. 

Usually when she's gone I eat her food, smell her clothes, and sleep. She doesn't know about this either. She's called the cops several times. I really don't know why she would call them. Maybe she's lonely? Does she need a freind maybe? 

When she gets home she makes sure her security system is in perfect condition, along with all the cameras in the house. I don't know why she would need these things the neighbors are very nice. Not like I get the chance to talk to them.

Then she usually looks in her basement, attic, all the closets, and stuff. I don't know why she does this thing. Maybe she's wishing she had someone to play hide and seek with. I wanna play. But she won't notice me. I throw stuff around when she makes me mad. One time this sharp object I think she called it a knife? I threw it down and she shrieked and ran out of the house. I don't know why she's so afraid it never harms me.

One day she hired a nice man. This man had these weird devices and kept on asking me to interact with them. But I tried and nothing worked. Silly man. He probably thinks I don't know what he's doing. Trying to get rid of me.

This mean man kept on saying silly words. But to no avail. I was still there. I threw a knife and a entire couch at this man once. I never saw him again. Then the girl started to move her stuff out.  And that included me. She unloaded her stuff to a new building and I was in awe. It's been so long since I've seen another building.

Then something scary appeared behind me. Something like a ghost? Except way more scary. This ghost was really really mean. He always hurt the girl. I tried to stop him. He only hurt me instead.
 
One day I came to him and asked him why he was doing this his only response were quiet murmurs and grunts. There were a few words jumbled in there but not enough to be considered a sentence.

 One day a man called a priest came to the house to "vanquish evil spirits" whatever that means. I was then transported to a new place. A body? I had my own body! I ran jumping and flying and shaking. I couldn't even make a full sentence I was so excited. Then the priest man smashed into my chest with what I think is called a book and I was suddenly thrown out and the other ghost went inside the body. I told him "that's my body".

I went back into the body and we both were in there smashing around until I realized my body was covered in blood. Wait. I was outside of the body. Its- it's the girl. It was the girls body. The priest man stood there horrified. Looking at the mangled corpse. Well atleast my job with Satan is done.
