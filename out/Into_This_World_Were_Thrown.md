The radio is at full volume, The Doors, I need to stay awake. The headlights are the only lights for miles. It’s too late and no one else is on the road. Four hours down, at least four more to go to get back home. The highway, the little I can see of it, blends into gray streaks in my tired eyes. A black trash bag on the shoulder zips by, unremarkable until the fourth one, passes, equally spaced along the road.

The monotony of the night breaks. Before long I pass at least fifteen, my heavy eyes still blurry from my drowsiness. Was someone dumping trash late at night? As bag after bag passes it feels unlikely. I drive, my nose over the steering wheel, for ten miles. The bags don’t stop.

My curiosity is begging me to pull off and see what’s in them. There’s too many to just be trash. No one else is on the road–I can piss while I’m stopped too. I switch on my hazard lights and pull over. The line of bags continues as far my headlights illuminate and at least ten miles back. There must be thousands of them. 

I pop the door and the night’s wet heat hits me, then the smell. Rotten eggs and burnt honey. I heave, and pull the door shut. Too late, the smell is just as strong in the cabin of my Prius. My curiosity wins again, and I need to piss. I step out of the car and make my way down the steep shoulder towards the tree line where the bags were left.

Crickets fill the night with an unending drone. My head pulses and I feel as if my body is two seconds ahead of my thoughts. The smell, sound, and bizarre nature of the bags all came together as I fell to my knee. The bag is so close, the smell forces its way into my nose and mouth, I taste it in my throat. I know I should get back in my car, ignore the bags and try to get home before sunrise but I need to know now. I’m not sure why but I know that whatever is in those bags needs to be seen. 

I reach out and pull the plastic drawstring of the bag toward me. It’s heavy. It is dead weight. My heart flips as I move to open the black bag. I hesitate. The bag shifts. I recoil. The opening of the bag pushes outward. A tiny hand breaks free from the bag, wet and shaking in the headlights. 

“Fuck,” I force myself forward despite my fear, and grab the hand, icy cold. I pull the hand and push on the bag.

“I got you, don’t worry, I got you,” my voice shakes as I try to be a hero. 

The bag opens–the arm, then the head emerges from the plastic. 

I vomit.

Maggots writhe over the now lifeless body.

The radio cuts through the crickets.

“Riders on the storm.”
