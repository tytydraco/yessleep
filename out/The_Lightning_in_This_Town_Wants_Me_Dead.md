The first time I was struck by lightning was in the summer three years back. I was coming home from working on a neighbor’s car when the rain started, a red-black cloud like a slit gut splitting the sky in half.

Well, about damn time, I thought. It had been a dry August, and a little moisture would have done the town good. 

It was as I got out of my car that a feeling up the back of my neck gave me pause. Growing up near bear country you get to know the sense of some big animal watching you, and I had that same sense then, only it came from where that dark cloud bled and threatened a storm. 

I’d never held with Walpurgis town superstition, nor what folks said about the things living in the National Park nearby, or what was walking in the mountain forests beyond; if you listened to the way people get going around here you’d think that there were devils and spirits of all kinds just about everywhere you looked.

It was just talk, that’s all I figured. 

But as I looked up at that dirty cloud and heard the start of thunder I could hardly move with the dread of that storm coming in. I stood where I was like my boots had been nailed down to the driveway, the rainfall soaking my shirt through to the skin.

Still the ‘bear feeling’ ran up and down my neck, and if my legs had worked right I would have ran.

The first visible lightning flash came so close that I could smell the reek of sulphur and ozone. Felt the heat of it blast me like the first step out of an aircraft into a tropical country. I remember thinking that it was a bluff charge, trying to scare me off out of its way, only for all I wanted to I still could not move.

Fear like that gets people killed in the wilderness every day, and right there in the heart of Walpurgis I came close. There was another growl of thunder, and even before the second bolt of lightning struck I knew that it would hit me. That what was up there in the sky was no natural weather phenomenon but something like the mountain god the cult up in Hill Town kneel to, as the rumors go.

“Black bear,” I thought. “Hunter lightning.”

Funny where our minds go at times like that.

I recall a pull like hands all down the back of me yanking me to the ground, then a light in my eyes of such a whiteness I thought it’d burn me blind. Next thing I knew I was on my back in the driveway, my throat full of smoke, and then my wife was running out of the house screaming my name and pulling my clothes off where they’d melted down to the skin.

“Jesus, Ann,” I heard myself say distantly. “I’m alright. Just get me up and inside. Ain’t safe out here.”

The shock had washed my fear into calm, and in a way I wish it hadn’t, being that it made it easier to forget what I’d felt before that bolt knocked me down.

I brushed it off as something I’d imagined in the panic of being caught out in a storm, terror attaching character and purpose to something that had none. It was an accident, I said to myself, that was all.

I spent a couple of days holed up in a hospital ward, counting my blessings that I only had second-degree burns. More visitors came by than I cared to see, being that my ordeal had exhausted me to the point I would have gladly killed a man if it meant that I could sleep some.

Ann got me through it all, sitting by me with her hand in mine no matter the time, day or night. Though she didn’t talk much I had the notion she’d seen something that afternoon that spooked her. Seen, or felt it like eyes on her as she ran out to pick me up off the ground.

A hostility, she’d later call it. Not a thinking sort of hatred, like a human being would have, but like something startled in the woods and mad about it.

Once I was out of the ward and my burns had healed up I went back to work, pushing that day as far out of my head as it would go. I traveled out of town for a time, worked in other places that rained heavy and stormed hard, and though I got myself indoors quicker than I would have done before the incident I felt nothing like I had in Walpurgis.

I’d been mistaken, I thought. Must have been. Only Ann biting at her lip and looking at me strange whenever a hard rain got going made me think any different.

“Listen,” I said, once I’d had just about enough of this. “I’ll be fine. It ain’t gonna happen again.”

“It might,” Ann insisted. “People who’ve been struck by lightning once are more likely to get struck again. I read it online.”

Being that Ann read more or less everything online and from questionable sources I paid this no mind.

It’s as I was putting my coat on that she said, “You ain’t the only one that got hit in that storm, Joe.”

I looked round at her, brows just about up to my ears.

“Well, who else was?”

“Fred Meier. My second cousin. You know him.”

I did. Ann’s family were of the old German settler stock up in the North side of town. Most still had traces of the accent and some even spoke a little German, mainly the older folks. I figured that’s where all the superstition in this town came from: old ghost stories and fairy tales from that far country.

“Fred Meier,” I said. “Sure, I know him. So how’d it happen?” 

“He was out hiking with some folks when they got caught out in the bad weather. Weren’t forecast, so they couldn’t reschedule or anything. Well, they were heading up some high path when Fred started acting strange, said he was sure something was after him.

“Next thing they knew a big old lightning bolt came down and they were all flat on their backs half-stunned, and Fred hit so bad he couldn’t move all down his left side.”

“Well, shit,” I said. “How’s he doing now?”

Ann shrugged.

“Getting his movement back some. He ended up in some hospital out of town because of overcrowding, else we would have seen him, I bet. I ought to visit.”

“You take yourself over there,” I said. “He’ll be glad to see you, I’m sure.”

Ann was clearly hoping I’d stay home after what she’d told me, and in hindsight I should have. 

As it was I went to do some work on a roof that’d had shingles blown off it in the storm; I’d always been an odd jobs man, and I could repair just about anything I set my hand to. I felt a whole lot better once I was up there on the top of that house being of use to someone. Keeping active keeps the mind clean, and I had a lot of dirt to shake.

But it was while I was up there, sweating and cursing under the sun, that I got that feeling of woodland eyes on me again so strong that I couldn’t brush it off or ignore it the way I wanted to. For a while I told myself maybe there was a coyote or a wild cat around, watching me from the street, but no matter which way I turned I couldn’t see a thing.

I sat up on that roof, scared without a cause, starting to blame Ann for putting an idea in my head I couldn’t seem to shake. Then like some disgruntled animal the first thunder boomed over me, and I was on the ladder and scuttling down it so fast that my boot missed a rung and my heart just about dropped out of my ass.

I held onto either side of the ladder, my loose foot scraping desperately for grip. 

Whatever that storm was had been watching me, and now it had me where I couldn’t run. A fork of lightning thrashed the rooftop so close that all the hairs on my face singed off with the heat. The force of that nearby blow punched the ladder clean off the wall, and it’s lucky I didn’t have too far to jump clear of it before it fell on top of me.

I lay on my back, breathing hard, trying to get myself up and failing each time. It was having that pressure over me that did it, the knowing that the lightning was hostile and aware of me. Though it couldn’t eat like a bear it could kill me as surely as one: it’s as I was thinking this that a second strike clapped over my head, and what I felt then was like being hit by a lit firework, a force that stunned me into the black of near death that I’d seen once before.

I felt an uncanny acceptance come over me, and I waited to die, terror burned out of me into cold. When I came round I was surprised that nobody had run over to check on me, but with the storm still going strong most folks were likely safe indoors.

I stayed where I was, eyes closed, hoping to God the lightning wouldn’t notice that it hadn’t killed me.

I probably lay there a good twenty minutes before I dared to get up again, stiff all over with the taste of metal so strong in my mouth that I had to spit. My heart seemed to beat off rhythm, though whether it was the strike that did it or the fear that still had not left me I do not know.

That was the first time in my life I’ve had to leave a job unfinished, though at least I had a solid reason. I thought about lying to Ann about why I’d had to call it off, but she knew as soon as I walked through the front door what had happened. 

I had burns running down my shoulders like the branches of red trees, or the scratches left by claws.

“Oh,” said Ann. “Oh, Joe. What are we going to do?”

There were two more incidents with the lightning after that. The first time I was indoors, cooped up in front of the computer looking into some online courses my wife had been on my neck to take so as I wouldn't have to go outside to work so much. I knew she was onto a decent idea, but I've only ever been good with my hands and I couldn't make head nor tail of anything I was looking at.

I guess that's why I didn't notice the clouds building outside my window till the first roll of thunder went off like the sound of vehicles colliding on a wet road. It occurred to me that the sound had always come first in this sinister weather, that this, too, was wrong.

Then the lightning snapped so close to the house that the whole window lit up white, harsh enough that my eyes watered with it. 

I remember thinking, "Can't get me in here, can you, you old bastard," before it struck again, this time somewhere on the roof.

All the lights in the house blew out with a noise like a shotgun blast, and I felt the shock of it all up my arm from touching the keyboard, knocking me off my chair and against the wall. I sat there cradling the limb, muttering the Lord's prayer and stuttering like hell over it, too. 

All the while that storm went to work out there, and I could swear that it was angry it couldn't do more. Like it could see me, smell me, just couldn't get in; burning out all the electrics was the closest it could get.

"This ain't right, Joe," said Ann, shaking next to me in bed later that night. "How did it get inside? How did it know where you were when—"

“When it couldn't see you”, she meant.

She was starting to think the same way I was.

The last time the lightning got me was a month later, when I'd been cooped up for so long out of work that I'd started going a little stir crazy.  I checked the skies beyond the windows with a paranoid frequency, desperate to go outside but in such a fear of the storm thing killing me that each time I went to my front door I could never bring myself to step foot beyond it. 

It was Ann's birthday coming up that finally pushed me to do it. Sure, I could have ordered her something online, but I couldn't stand gawping at that screen for even one more second. Besides, I'd noticed since the third incident I had sort of a strange effect on electronic devices. Lights flickered, watches stopped working the second they were strapped to my wrist, and speakers started giving off an odd noise like they were picking up interference.

All in all I was jumping at the chance to get myself outdoors and away from everything, only I should have known better. Did know better. The confinement had sent me a little over the edge. I suppose I wasn't thinking straight, and Ann wasn't home to set me right.

I let myself out of the house and set off for the nearest store on foot, telling myself that it was safer than driving, that I could duck for cover if I sensed something coming on.

I hadn't cleared more than a few blocks when I felt a raindrop hit the back of my neck and nearly jumped a mile. Looking up at the sky I saw a black cloud had started pooling like blood in a blue iris, and I recognised at once that it was the same storm that had kept on me since the start.

I felt a sweat starting under my shirt, but all I felt was cold as panic took me in a stranglehold. There was the feeling I was face to face with an animal, each of us waiting to see what the other would do. Out of the corner of my eye I took measure of the nearby buildings, judging how quickly I could get myself inside and wait for the storm to pass.

Before I knew it I was running as fast as my body would let me being that I was forty, and my previous injuries had me feeling a good deal older. I felt a weight over me like something pressed down from within the sky, and it was just as I got myself through the door of a tired looking bar that lightning hit the sidewalk, shattering the windows in a rain of charred glass. 

The bar staff rushed forward to assess the damage, hanging cautiously back as the storm warred in the street beyond.

"Shit," a man said to me. "Are you alright? You nearly got yourself shocked just there."

"I need a drink," is all I could think to say.

I don't recall how I got home. By the time I got in and lay down I was so drunk that I went immediately to sleep. I remember thinking that it was easier that way. That if the lightning came again I wouldn't know.

When Ann found me she sat down on the edge of the bed and started biting at her lips until I thought she'd gnaw right through to the meat.

"I'll go up and see my cousin," she told me. "He's bound to know something, surely. I'll go and see him."

She said it reluctantly, like it was some difficult thing she'd been working towards for a long time, which I suppose she had. 

I didn't see how it would help any. Surely Fred was just as lost in all this as I was. Still I said nothing, let Ann drive on up the next morning. Let her think it would do some good.

When she came back later that night she had a look on her face I didn't recognise, one I still can't put a name to. All I knew was that something had gone wrong while she'd been visiting. That, or she'd got wind of something she didn't much want to hear.

“Well,” I said. “How’s Fred?”

“Alright,” said Ann, setting her handbag down on the floor. “Well as he can be. Hasn’t been outside in weeks. My Great Aunt Lina was there with him, visiting from out of town. We got to talking.”

“Ain’t Lina the one into all that cosmetology shit?” I asked.

“Meteorology, honey. Weather studies. She says even before her boy got struck and holed up in that hospital she was reading all about it, keeping scrap books of old newspaper clippings and articles she printed off from her computer. Real organised. She showed me everything she’d put together, said she’d tried taking it to all sorts of people— the authorities, psychics, experts in weather phenomenon. Nobody paid her any notice.”

“About what?” I asked, though I knew almost since she’d started talking where the conversation was leading up to.

“The lightning,” said Ann. “It was ’65 last time it went after people the way it’s been doing this summer. The autumn of that year there were flash storms just about every week or so. Lightning that just snuck up on you. Caught houses on fire, blew electrics and knocked trees down. All the things you’d expect, at first. Then it started after people.

There was a little girl, Hannah Müller. Lina knew her pretty well, played with her sometimes. She was just twelve years old when the lightning hit her the first time. She was riding her bicycle up and down outside her house when the clouds came in, and next thing anyone knew a bolt of lightning snapped down like an elastic band and struck her clean off the bike.

Her hair and clothes were on fire but she wasn’t screaming— the shock, I guess. Her mother ran out to get to her and four more strikes came down, one after the other in a circle, like the storm was pacing around that girl, trying to get at her again. It only touched her the once that time or it would have killed her.

It’s as the family tried moving Hannah out of state for better medical care that it did. They were loading suitcases into the back of a moving van when the storm came back. Hannah started yelling, tripped over herself trying to get back in the house saying it was chasing her. Right then the lightning hit that little girl three times, stabbing at her till she was dead. Twelve years old and killed on her own doorstep. Can you imagine?”

I didn’t much want to, but I shook my head and let Ann talk.

“Hannah wasn’t the only one that ended up dying that way. There was a lady driving to work that said she felt something strange, like a warning bell going off in her head. She thought maybe she was about to get hit by another car, or somebody was going to run out across the road; it was that kind of feeling. The lightning hit her so fast all she saw was a white light across the windshield before she totalled her car against a fence.

She lost a leg in that crash, and because of the lightning hitting her she couldn’t use her hands much either. Something to do with the nerves, I guess. The second time she was struck coming out of the hospital— happened so fast passers-by don’t reckon she saw it. She died instantly. Her body was charred nearly to dust in how direct it hit.”

“Fucking Christ,” I said.

I got up to make coffee, needing something to do with my hands.

“Aunt Lina was just a kid at that time,” said Ann, “but she got curious how come there had been two cases like that so close together. She started her research then and just kept on going, learning all the time. Every thirty to sixty years or so there are incidents with the lightning in this town, and this town only; it never crosses the border, somehow. Aberrant, Aunt Lina calls it. Aberrant lightning— Lord, that lady has a way with words.”

Ann took the coffee cup as I handed it to her and blew on it gently as she gathered her thoughts.

“Each time it comes there’s reports people sense it before they see anything, though it’s never forecast and it never seems like the right weather for it. Then the lightning just keeps coming back and back till the people it hits die, except sometimes if it’s starved out long enough it'll move off again. It’s like it’s alive, somehow. There’s been plenty of folks that think it is.”

I nodded.

“When it came that first time I thought a lot about wild animals that get aggressive with human beings. Man-eating gators. Bucks that charge at people passing through National Parks because they’ve gotten too comfortable being approached by people, or because we’ve  started moving in on their territory.”

“You ain’t the first one to say that. Lina said the oldest accounts she could find were from the settling families. They were even more superstitious than people are now, and maybe they weren’t wrong to be.”

“What did they say?”

I’d given up my pretence of not believing by now, embraced what I’d known in my soul from the first day I’d encountered that lightning.

“The settlers thought that whatever was causing that lightning wasn’t the weather at all,” said Ann. “More likely some kind of spirit or creature. Hell knows there’s enough talk around here of that kind of thing. Sure, it looked just like lightning, but it behaved like some angry animal that got woken up or disturbed somehow and attacked whoever it saw first.

Usually it’d go for two, three, even five people at one time before it settled. There wasn’t any reasoning with it or chasing it off. You couldn’t bargain with it, kill or hurt it. You just had to stay out of its way until it left. Or slept, I’d guess. The settlers had a name for it. ‘Schwarzbär’.”

“Black bear,” I said.

Ann’s eyes widened.

“How’d you know that? You don’t speak a lick of German.”

“Ain’t hard to figure out. Besides, that's what came into my head that afternoon you found me in the driveway. Black bear. Hunter lightning.”

We sat silent a while, watching our coffee steam, not much wanting to drink.

“What do we do, Joe?” asked Ann at last.

“Well, I guess we’ve got to move,” I said without much confidence.

“How in God’s name are we going to afford it? Besides, like I said, it won’t work. Look what happened to Hannah.”

“Then we wait it out,” I said, exasperated. “What’s the longest the Bear’s been awake for?”

At this Ann worked her teeth into the little scar on her lip.

“From what Lina showed me about a year. There were times people braved stepping out too soon and got hit right away, like the Bear was lying low thinking to catch them.”

I began to knead my eye sockets with the balls of my fingertips.

“So you’re saying I’ve got to hide in here and hope I get the timing right? How are we supposed to live when I can’t go to work?”

Ann laid her hand on mine and squeezed it lightly.

“Joe, it’s either this or you don’t live at all. I don’t see that we have a choice.”

Just then thunder tore over the top of the house, and I knew that Ann was right. This lightning means to kill me, and if it reaches me it will.
