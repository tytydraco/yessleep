I didn't know where else to come with this, I'm a dark web surfer and recently found this leaked government email, I thought it was fake at first but, it all just seemed too good to be fake, too unimaginable. 

Have a look for yourself.

>Hi John, we found this... not sure exactly what it is, seems it be a written first hand encounter of what the cult its-self is capable of, not too sure but this could be vital for us as it can tell us where they are and why the hell that cult are taking so many more people. It can also help us figure out why the town just disappeared off the radar, I only found 3 hand written maps with the town on it, I'm sending them into the office today. But I don't think we can keep pretending all they missing people were killed by those serial killers and mass disasters, and we cant fake anymore missing peoples reports. Just have a look at it and see wat you think.

***The Evidence Attached:***

I was born and raised in the quaint town of Strathen, nestled in the heart of South Carolina. Life had always been peaceful here, with its rolling green hills and friendly faces. But everything changed when the darkness descended upon us, shrouding our once tranquil community in fear and terror.

&#x200B;

It began with whispers. Hushed conversations among the townsfolk, murmurs of a secret cult hidden deep in the mountains. Rumours spread like wildfire, claiming that this cult was responsible for the disappearances plaguing our town. People were vanishing without a trace, leaving behind nothing but heartbroken families and unanswered questions.

&#x200B;

As days turned into weeks, the whispers grew louder. Fear painted the faces of my fellow townspeople, but we couldn't let the unknown swallow us whole. We united, forming a protective barricade around Pleasantville, determined to shield ourselves from the horrors lurking in the mountains.

&#x200B;

The barricade stood tall, a physical symbol of our defiance against the cult. We erected it with sweat-soaked brows and trembling hands, each nail driven into place fuelled by our determination to protect our loved ones. At its centre stood an ancient altar, adorned with symbols we hoped would ward off the evil that sought to consume us.

&#x200B;

For a while, it seemed as though our efforts had paid off. The disappearances ceased, and a glimmer of hope flickered within our hearts. We believed we had banished the darkness from our lives. Little did we know, we had only angered the nameless being we had unwittingly appeased for so long.

&#x200B;

One moonless night, as I patrolled the perimeter of our barricade, I felt a sinister presence tugging at the edges of my sanity. The air grew thick with a palpable malevolence, causing the hair on my arms to stand on end. I heard whispers carried on the wind, taunting me, mocking our feeble attempt to defy the forces beyond our comprehension.

&#x200B;

As dawn broke, a thick fog rolled down from the mountains, enveloping our town in an otherworldly haze. Panic gripped our souls, as we knew that our barrier would be tested. We stood shoulder to shoulder, our eyes darting frantically, searching for the unseen enemy that lurked just beyond our sight.

&#x200B;

And then, with a bone-chilling howl, they came.

&#x200B;

A horde of twisted figures emerged from the fog, their eyes gleaming with an unholy fervor. They wore tattered robes, their faces masked by an expressionless void. They moved with an unnatural grace, their steps synchronized as if guided by a hidden conductor.

&#x200B;

We fought with every ounce of strength we possessed, wielding whatever makeshift weapons we could find. But it was a futile effort against the cultists, whose devotion to their dark deity granted them inhuman strength and resilience. They tore through our defenses like a hurricane, a wave of malevolence crashing against our barricade.

&#x200B;

One by one, my friends and neighbors fell. Their cries echoed through the air, their pleas for mercy drowned out by the cacophony of chaos. I watched helplessly as their lifeless bodies were dragged into the depths of the mountains, destined to become sacrifices to the unknown being they worshipped.

&#x200B;

I refused to be another victim. Desperation ignited a fire within me, fueling my resolve to fight until my last breath. With bloodied fists and a heart filled with righteous fury, I engaged the cultists in a battle of life and death. But it was a battle I could not win alone.

&#x200B;

As the cultists closed in on me, their twisted smiles sending shivers down my spine, I felt a surge of power emanating from the protective altar. It pulsed with an ancient energy, a beacon of hope in the midst

&#x200B;

of despair. With renewed determination, I made a final stand, rallying the remaining townspeople around me.

&#x200B;

Together, we fought with a newfound strength. The protective symbols etched into our minds, we pushed back against the darkness, refusing to succumb to its clutches. The cultists recoiled, their once confident expressions now twisted with fear.

&#x200B;

In a blaze of defiance, we pushed them back, inch by agonizing inch. Their retreat became a rout, and the fog began to dissipate, revealing the morning sun in all its glory. The cultists vanished into the depths of the mountains, leaving behind a town scarred but undefeated.

&#x200B;

Strathen would never be the same. We had witnessed horrors beyond imagination, and the scars etched upon our souls would never fade. But we had survived, and in doing so, we had shattered the grip the cult held over our lives.

&#x200B;

The mountains remained silent, devoid of the cult's presence. The sacrifices had ceased, and the nameless being they worshipped was left hungry and furious. It sent forth its wrath in the form of thunderous storms and eerie tremors, a reminder of the darkness that still lingered on the fringes of our existence.

&#x200B;

But we were no longer afraid. We stood united, our hearts intertwined, forever vigilant against the encroaching shadows. For even as the cult sought to regain its hold over our town, we would never yield. We had faced the abyss and returned stronger, armed with the knowledge that the light of unity could triumph over the darkest of evils.

&#x200B;

And so, Strathen remained a bastion of resilience, a testament to the indomitable human spirit. We vowed to protect our town, to never let the shadows reclaim what was rightfully ours. For as long as the mountains loomed over us, we would be vigilant, ready to face whatever horrors awaited us in the shadowy depths, and I'm afraid, they aren't finished with us just yet.
