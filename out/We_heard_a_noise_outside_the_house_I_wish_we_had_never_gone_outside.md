I don't usually write too much, anyway, I needed a place to write this, I guess I want to get this off my chest... Let me put you in context.

I live in Alberta, Canada, with my wife, we have been living in the country for a couple of years now, we use to live in Toronto, and I must admit that I miss the city a little, but we love the forests, lakes, and animals that are here.

We live in an area where the neighbors are at least 200 meters from each other, in between there are only forests and trails, and as you can imagine, there are wild animals, bears, moose, foxes, deer, raccoons... They don't usually go near the roads, but the neighbors have recommended us to buy a weapon... not pistols, but rifles or shotguns, now I'm grateful to have done it at the time, we have a couple of pets, including a Cat, it's usually outside almost all day...

Kuro to our surprise, he made friends with a little fox, they walk together, eat together and rest together, but at night the little fox always leaves, my wife called him "Feneko" he is cute, but I always have a heart attack when I hear his "Laughter" when I wake up.

The routine is like this, we wake up, and while I put the water for the coffee my wife opens the door for Kuro so that he can go outside, where Feneko is already waiting for him, there they walk during the morning for a few hours, until we put them food, then they continue walking or resting until the evening, And when the sun is about to set, Feneko leaves... Well, a few weeks ago something strange happened...

We were getting everything ready to go to sleep, until we heard something scratching the door very intensely, we thought it would be one of the cats or dogs that had been left outside, my wife quickly went to open the door while I started counting the heads of the pets... They were all there, but before I could tell my wife that no animal was missing, I heard the sound of a small animal running around the house, and that unmistakable sound of claws brushing against the wooden floor, when I could see well... it was Feneko.

It was weird, he never went into the house, never. My wife closed the door and came back, she had been a little scared by how fast he had gotten in, and I told her

"Look... it's Feneko"

She looked at me as if I had told her the most obvious thing in the world and said

"fucking fenneko... took me by surprise but... Look love, he seems... scared"

I hadn't noticed that the poor fox was frightened, tail bristling, trembling, and seeking comfort from his cat friend, and curiously, the pets weren't... Well, you know, chasing the fox that had snuck into the house, they were alert but not for him.

"Maybe a bear... or a moose"

I swear, those wretches have horrible tempers, my wife instinctively went to get one of our guns, a shotgun... We don't consider ourselves trigger-happy, but in this place you have to be alert, we stay a little longer in the living room, waiting, I tried to peek through the peephole in the door... and I saw some bushes move, something had gotten into them, something big, and he thought it might be a bear or a moose... It seemed a little strange to me, but I went back with my wife to be together and calmer, and we waited... We wait and wait.

After a few hours, we heard some scratches, and... The dogs, cats and the fox became very alert, together with my wife we decided to try to look out the door, we couldn't see anything through the peephole, so we decided to open it as slowly and quietly as we could... Knowing what happened, fuck... We should have stayed at home, I looked out first, with a flashlight, my wife behind me with the gun, we looked ahead and nothing, to the left and nothing, to the right and shit...

We still can't forget that thing, we don't know what the fuck it was... It was like a bear... No, a moose? No, to a better definition it was kind of a moose, but with a much more deformed and robust face, with huge antlers sharp and stained with blood, and his mouth, could he swear by god that his mouth was... full of fangs, teeth of a predator... That monster wasn't a moose, it was like a very bad joke of nature...

He was looking at us, with those eyes... eyes like a damn person's... And I don't know if it was a matter of tension, but that "moose" opened his mouth even more, and without taking his eyes off us he began to... speak? I don't know, it was barely perceptible...

I don't consider myself a coward by any means, but when I saw that thing I was paralyzed, my legs were shaking, I don't take pride in it, but it was like having the devil in front of me

My wife, stronger in character than me, pulled me to the side, yelling "Stay Back!" After that she don't hesitate twice to shoot straight at the thing... It hit, almost a direct hit, after all that monster was huge, I could almost hear the cartridges sinking into the skin of that thing, that grotesque sound...

A few seconds later, that beast started screaming and roaring... do you know that cougars  almost scream as if they were slitting a woman's throat? Well, it was the same here... The beast was stunned by the gunfire... And although I could swear it hit him right in the head he kept moving and complaining, I was shocked, after all my wife was only a few inches away from me, I was able to cover my ears and my wife unloaded all the bullets on that thing until they stopped coming out, but that monster... I was still standing, screaming... Yelling at us, I grabbed my wife quickly by the clothes when I heard the "Click" of the shotgun running out of bullets and pulled her into the house as fast as I could, closing the door...
