I had this camera setup to watch bluebirds nesting in a small birdhouse on my property. It was winter, and the bluebirds had long since left for warmer climates, so I decided to move the camera. I took it off the birdhouse and repositioned it towards the woods, hoping to catch some footage of Bobcats or Coyotes passing through. The area is very remote, and access by foot is nearly impossible. My property is bordered by a 1500-acre state park, and it’s an area that’s difficult to navigate, especially during the colder months. There are no houses nearby, and the land between me and the park is swampy and thick with trees, making it nearly impenetrable for anyone trying to wander in.



At first, the videos didn’t reveal much. The footage mostly showed the usual winter wildlife, but then something strange started to happen. Around the hours of 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., I began to see unusual lights in the videos. Initially, I thought they were just hunters with flashlights, but the lights would move too quickly and unpredictably, almost like they were darting from one spot to another. It was far too fast and erratic for any human or vehicle movement. The more I watched, the stranger it became. In some of the footage, there were even what appeared to be strange, fleeting shapes flying across the screen. My first instinct was to dismiss them as insects or some kind of small creature, but there’s a problem with that—it's the middle of winter, and temperatures are regularly below freezing here. Bugs don’t fly in those conditions, not to mention the fact that this is the coldest time of year.



The lights seemed to move in patterns that didn’t make sense. Sometimes they would be concentrated near the tree trunks, other times further out in the clearing, flickering and shifting in ways that could not be explained by natural phenomena. It was as though they were controlled by something invisible, something that didn’t follow the normal laws of nature. There’s an eerie quality to watching the footage—something that you can’t quite put your finger on, but you know it’s not right.



There are marshy areas near the edges of my property, and some people have suggested the lights could be a phenomenon called “Will-o’-the-wisp.” While it’s a logical explanation, I don’t find it particularly comforting. The Will-o’-the-wisp is often linked to folklore, said to be an atmospheric ghost light or spirit that appears in swamps and marshy areas. The idea of spirits wandering around my land doesn’t sit well with me, especially considering how isolated the area is. There’s no one out here—just wilderness, darkness, and the occasional creature passing through.



What makes this even stranger is the fact that the area is so difficult to access. If someone were to try and reach it by foot, they would face rough terrain, thick underbrush, and deep, muddy marshes. No one comes back here. It’s too remote, too inconvenient to travel through. So, the idea that something unusual is happening in such a hidden part of the world is even more unsettling. I’ve watched the footage over and over again, trying to find a rational explanation for what’s happening, but every time I think I have it figured out, something new shows up that throws everything into question.



In the end, it’s just too strange. I’ve captured things on camera that shouldn’t exist in the frozen, isolated wilderness behind my house, and I’m left wondering what exactly is out there, lurking just beyond the reach of the camera.
