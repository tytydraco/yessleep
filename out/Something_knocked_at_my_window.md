5 years ago, I was 10 years old and I was visiting my grandparents. I was going to sleep at their place and I used to ask my grandmother to tell me stories before falling asleep. Then she told me that she would tell me the story of the yellow eyes that visit you at night. 

By the next day I had almost completely forgotten the story, I only had a vague recollection of what it was, spirits of people who are not buried, I had forgotten any other details. When I asked my grandmother to tell me the story again, she simply asked me: 

"Which story?"

I had noticed that she had huge dark circles under her eyes and I knew that she had been quite senile lately. On the same day, she fainted and was taken to the hospital. She died after 3 days. 2 years later, the same thing happened to my grandfather. 

My parents told me they didn't know what it was about when I told them about grandma's story, they hadn't heard of it. 

The house where I spent a good part of my life was on the outskirts of the city, where in the evening you could hear drunkards cursing in the streets. It was a place where you saw many strange things and also many things happened. The house had two floors, the ground floor where my and my parents' room was, and the attic.

 I was used to sleeping through the noise, constantly being all kinds of ambient sounds from the wheels of the trains screeching on their own to the screams of people who no longer knew about themselves from drinking. 

One night while I was sitting in bed on the phone I heard something knocking on the window. I looked but I didn't see anything and I returned to what I was doing. The next two nights the same thing happened, and then I decided to change my position in bed to face the window. 

I heard a knock and suddenly looked up. I saw some bright yellow eyes on a black figure, that figure had no face and no legs, it was levitating.

 It started to open the window, it was a window that could be opened very easily, you just lifted it. It entered my room and I wanted to run and scream but I was paralyzed. 

My grandmother had told me stories about such spirits that belong to people whose bodies were not put in a coffin, but I thought they were just stories, nothing else, so of course I forgot them over time. She told me that they don't hurt you, but once you see them you won't be the same and they will visit you every night, at first once a night, but with time they come more and more often, until you can no longer sleep at all and end up going crazy.

Now it's night, so far I've been visited 6 times and it's 00:30, two months have passed since the first visit and the maximum number of visitors was 7. 

During these 2 months my parents ended up in the hospital, having mental problems. I came to the conclusion that they were also visited, but more often than me, I had noticed that they had dark circles, but I didn't think much of it. 

My grandparents haven't been with us for a few years so I can ask them for advice, but I don't think they're the only ones who know about it, in a neighborhood with so many drunks, surely someone must have seen them, but I have to hurry to find them, I'm getting less and less sleep and I feel like I'm going crazy.

4 days have passed since the last entry in the diary of the latest events. In the meantime, in the evening I would walk the streets, seeing the silhouettes following me, and I would ask any drunkard I saw if he knew a story about spirits of people who were not buried. The first 2 evenings I had no success and I reached a total of 17 visits per night, I only slept during the day when I was not visited.
 
On the 3rd evening I reached the edge of the neighborhood, I had started to lose hope in finding a solution, when I met an old man who was sitting on a bench playing chess, he was face to face with a spirit, I understood then that he could see the ones behind me. 

I went to him without saying anything, I didn't know what to do, I just looked into his eyes. "Take a sit.", he urged me, so I sat next to the spirit face to face with the old man. He understood from my looks what I wanted and started to tell me. 

"These spirits or silhouettes, whatever you want to call them, they don't care what you call them, they belong to people whose bodies have not been buried, but I assume you already know that. They only show themselves to those who meet certain criteria:

1. You were at a funeral
 
2. You can help them. The first part is pretty easy to understand, the second is a bit more complicated. You may have already thought about the fact that you can get rid of them if you find the body and bury it, but it's too much work for a human, especially a child. 

And the rest of your family has been visited, I guess you have bad luck in your blood, but they won't stop until they find someone.

 You can only save your parents if you accept the job of the gravedigger. By this all the spirits will come to you and in turn take you to the body that belonged to them, there can only be 14 gravediggers, currently there are 12, the spirits choose 14 families to haunt until someone takes this job. I had this conversation with the rest of your family, even your great-grandparents, but they refused. Now it's your turn, but before you decide you need to know what it consists of." 

"You will work incessantly without sleep, water or food, you will no longer be able to interact with other people and they will not be able to see you. It will always be night for you, you will never again see the sun and any light source except the moon and the yellow eyes of the figures. Each individual figure will come in front of you, the others will wait their turn behind youÂ  and guide you to their body, each gravedigger has a fairly large search area, but they won't take you on other continents after bodies. 

Once it is found you will carry the body on a sled after you to the nearest cemetery, you will know where it is and you will bury it in the ground. This is what you will do for the rest of your normal life. You would have 64 more years to live, if you accept this you will do it in those 64 years. 

You have 4 days to decide, you will not be visited in them, but if you refuse, more will come than before, a lot more". 

Just as he finished the story to be told, the chess game was over, the old man had lost. It was day. At the moment I have 3 days to think. I know that if I refuse, my parents will die and before long probably so will I and another family will be chosen. 

The time has come for me to decide, I don't know what to choose, it seems like torture to live your life like this, but people rely on survival instinct, they would do whatever it takes, but can this be considered living? I don't know how I make my decision whether the old man will come to me or I just say yes or no, but one thing is clear, the diary ends here, if I say yes I will no longer be able to interact with the living world for anyone to see what I write in diary and if I say no, I won't spend my last days writing, especially since I already feel that I can't stand life anymore.
