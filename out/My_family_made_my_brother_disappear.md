If I had to tell you about my brother I'd apologise first, the last few years have been a blur to me, but before I left Mike was the most educated person I've ever known.

Lost in his books , questioning god at every turn and always arguing about the last sentence you said and the meaning of the words you used. After he graduated as a valedictorian my parents stopped convincing  him to come to church and removed all his pictures in the house. 

Needless to say our last family's Christmas meeting was a sour play in which I was the tree witnessing my mother clutching her pearls and apologizing to our friends and family. 

Mike came in late as usual, he would always blame it on his research but I knew he never liked the opening ceremony, which consisted of kneeling for grandma and letting her bless you. I always did it, with faith at first but as time passed it became more of a formality.

A daily ritual in honor of a grandmother to whom I've never seen the face. 

I remember vividly trying to catch her move from the couch, opening the door just enough so my right eye could see through the slit. Her black embroidered veil hiding every inch of her spread on the deep green couch clashed with the yellow stained wall. The windows were screwed shut and only  the golden chandelier over her head could not pierce through the black mass containing her from the real world.  and somehow I could feel her eyes staring at me. 

A few more friends joined in and kneeled, Mike chuckled and turned to me :

"How long are they staying this time ?"  

My father, in his unfitting suit,  stood up with less ease than the previous years, his red nose from the wine seemed to be leading his drunken dance, his big hands pulsing from a far as he finally grabbed a chair to help himself and with disdain, said :

"You need to leave, I mean it this time." 

Mike gathered his belongings in a mourning silence that spread across the table, my mother forced a smile to her friends.  All these years of supposed happiness within the "truth" couldn't refrain a single tear falling from her eye as her only son left for good.

Somehow I was relieved,  he chuckled the last I saw him when he had no business to, he had not called in months and the only updates were sporadic pictures of him looking rough in front of lakes across the globe. His demineer and look painted the shadow of a once hopeful and sarcastic kid. All I remember was his shaky voice and rumbles as he seemed to have lost his mind.

My parents had ruined his life by paying for online campaigns to make him lose all credibility on his research.  Turns out a  lot of wanna-be intellectuals would gladly take a check to prove if god is real or not.  He blew all his  funds into his lake chase and had no other options than to return to our home town. He began to work as a park ranger, he told that he needed to settle down, that the serenity of the forest would ease some wounds. But I suspected otherwise, the national park and grandiose landscape surrounding our village was known for its abnormal number of lakes. Sometimes forming and disappearing overnight, it became a local attraction. A simple explanation was given, we were located over really sensitive tectonic plates hitting each other  once or twice every two years. I had tried to ask him more about his obsession but he would not say a word. He knew I would report it back to grandma.

Right after Mike was shunned I had left to study films in New York and failed. The loneliness and work took most of my time and my parents learned that I may or may not respect one of my grandma's rules. To be honest I felt like an empty little statue my entire life,  fed to be kept alive. Homeschooled for most of it, I could not recall ever seeing another kid besides Mike or ever going to a playground. All I remember is being promised a “bright future and a joyful ascendance”, but only if I strictly followed my grandma’s teaching. 

Despite the loneliness I was loved and cared for, all of our friends would come by to drop food and toys. As for Mike, he did not receive the same attention nor care as he often ran away, and according to my mother showed signs of ”defaillance”, he was sent to public school and thus would miss a lot of ceremonies. 

At 20 the teaching stopped and I was deemed ready for the outside world, thanks to our friends I received tapes then DVD’s and later on a camera. Films became my only comfort in which I could project myself into the real world. I rarely cried, barely laughed and never enjoyed conversing too long and now I wanted to. 

Pretty soon I became an even emptier shell. The shock , the differences  and the lies of the outside world wrapped around my mind so tight I could feel each of my synapses about to explode and an intense heat everytime I missed a blessing call from Home. The idea of betraying grandma and locking myself out of bliss was an unfathomable option, I had worked so hard and broken so many bones to get there. The guilt came over me when I realised I had disobeyed the golden rule.

 "Own a rat, Feed the rat, Eat the rat." 

A process that must be repeated every two years but as soon as I arrived in the City a new world opened to me, for the first time I had prioritized myself, another strict rule I had violated. I never thought anything of it until the first symptoms showed up.

After another meaningless one night stand with my lonelier neighbour Jeremy I left earlier than usual, an engulfing heat awoke me, I could feel my inside pulsing and  my blood boiling. I ran in the cold with only a t-shirt and unfitting shorts.

The questions multiplied faster than the snow hitting my face. Shame sticking on me colder than the wind itself, I got  distracted to the point of going home head down. Retracing the steps from memory I bumped into  an old limping man along the way. I briefly stopped and apologized, he gave me a gentle look , then a creepy smile slowly opening his mouth to let drool come out. I turned around and left.

The pavement seems to flow under my feet, somehow the blend floor reassured me and cut me from my thoughts. Until I noticed the same crack appearing on the left side corner. At first they all seemed different from each other. The guilt turned into fear. For the first time I had grasped the severity of my negligence. I decided to count my steps and focused on finding a rat.

“1 , 2 , 3.”

The people were long gone and the silence settled again. The cars were in the same exact position as I started running. And now the buildings were the same.  

“A blue doctor’s office, a green pharmacy, and a yellow pet store”

The endless silent loop got broken by a rusty cane hitting the floor, the same man appeared, I stopped as he bumped into me intentionally this time. I apologised again. He did not look at me but kept smiling. An unstoppable smile, offering a disastrous spectacle. His yellow teeth detach embedded in a  foaming red substance as he tilts his head up. His empty eye sockets fixing me, he removed his jacket and hat and gently rested them on the gloomy doctor’s office facade.

“It’s all worth it”

He looked around him and joined the middle of the road. Kissing an invisible crowd, already bending to accept the grace of the audience, as if he had already won their hearts. His eyeless look stared directly at me. He started to mime. A crying man enters a home, slowly removing his shoes, closing the blinds, checking through the door, breaking his phone , grabbing a stool, fixing a cord on the ceiling. 

My stomach turned as he gasped for air, smiling. His melted hands pierced his throat. The non existent cord seemingly tightening under his weight. Flowing graciously and committed to the role he covered his face with a hideous sack of rotten flesh once called hands. Only to surprise me again with fewer teeth than before inches from my face. 

I left as fast I could, the crack was still the same. My feet hurt more each step, the tissue of my socks digging a burning hole on my tendons. 

Tears rolled down my face as home seemed like a distant memory. A pain on my left rib spiked me and I had no choice but to stop and sit. I leaned against a building  trying to understand the source of the pain. The image of the desperate clown imprinted on my eyelids, I knew she was now threatening me, she knew I wanted to leave and could not handle her long lasting dream.

 As I gathered my thoughts I looked around to locate myself, all I could feel was the strangers strong looks. Still I was grateful for their presence and noise.

 A young mother and her child approached.

“Mommy I want that one” said the kid pointing at a fish in the shopping window.

The woman kneels next to me.

“Are you okay ? Are you running away from somebody ? Do you need me to call someone ?”

Somehow I could not answer any of her questions and her multitudes of solutions seemed more like trouble than anything else.

I simply nodded yes and went into the store. All I needed was a rat and if grandma had led me here she might give me a second chance. I decided to buy the first rat I saw, always white with bloodshot eyes,  from a lab preferably. 

 Shaky and confused I threw all the cash I had left on the counter and ran home.

At 6 I owned an immortal one named Ratus, "immortal" as in my mom was probably changing it every two years. I remember the taste of these suspicious meals and the putrid smell of decaying meat oozing from the kitchen. It was a well presented stew with beans and grilled diced meat, my mom called it "The day that never ends". Our friends were well dressed for once and the blinds were screwed shut the night before and no light could come in. Over fifty souls cramped up around the dining table gathered around to watch us eat, some climbed on furniture, some became violent, only to take a look. To mimic any of our movements.

In a deep silence only  the deem light of the candles could reflect the adoration and excitement in their eyes. The room got full so they covered the wall of the hallway until grandma's door. 

As we finished the food my father arrived and ordered anyone who is not touching the wall with their back to leave. They all rushed, ripping each other’s clothes in the process. Just to slow themselves down. The gruntings and animalistic rage was echoed by my mother’s euphoria, smiling, for real.

“Get your ticket Tammy !”

My father  shoved the one deemed not chosen outside and ordered everyone back to the wall to hold  hands. He blew off the candle and the gates of the gathering room opened.

 Grandma would finally come out to eat.

Lewis was his new name, next to the window the little ball of fur was indiscernible from the snow, he became my only friend and I became the girl with a rat. People thinking you live in the sewer doesnt help for social interaction so Lewis took most of my time,  he was hiding in my pockets and I knitted little hats in between a love island episode and a good crying session. 

 I even forgot about Mike and his adventures.

And then came the time, The grey clouds pierced by the dark blue sky painted Lewis’s calm sleep. Laid over my sweater in between my shoulder and my neck, his breathing slowed down and his petite stature could not carry the tumor that grew on his neck. 

2 years had passed since I got him and now  I was watching the void with despair as my drowned eyes could not stop time. I was losing the only witness to my true form, the only eyes who never judged. I placed him in the palm of my left hand and gently expressed a silent gratitude, rubbing his tiny head one last time.

   I put him back in his cage, refilled his water and turned on the creep cast "The Left Right Game" episode that dropped on my birthday. The grief and the coincidence intrigued me and pretty soon the show and  sadness melted into a fog severing me from reality.

I went back to check on Lewis and almost 4 hours had passed and I missed the right time to prepare him the right way according to my mother. I turned around my room debating between calling my mom or eating him, I could not tell her I failed nor eat my best friend. I had learned that nobody in their sane mind would ever do such things to their pets.

I took a shower and some pills to push the pain away. No amount of drugs or loud music could turn off my brain as I retraced my day endlessly. Once again I had failed but this time only grandma could save it.

Suddenly the squeaking of Lewis's  wheel missed me so much I replayed it to sleep as if to celebrate the fact that from now on I would only slowly forget it.

I felt it appearing slowly in my ear, nursing me through my tears. It was constant as if weight was on it. In a second the noise of the city was shut off by the sound of metal ripping itself to shreds, it was real I could hear it awake. And despite it all I felt safe.

 The same exact sound ticking in my ear was now a loud roar in the room , the high frequency bounced through the wall, my ear started ringing and now I could barely stand up. As if lightning passed through my head.  Lewis was turning on the wheel faster and faster, his eyes tracking me around the room, his little palm over his nose as to mock me for not caring enough, I gasped in silence, tears rolling down my eyes. I closed them with all the strength I had left.

What have I done ? 

The walls had turned yellow and stained, the silence had frozen every atom possibly existent. I could feel her over my shoulder, her hot and acid breath radiating on my face. Followed by a  moist and dense atmosphere. The golden chandelier was casting a warm ray reminiscent of a childhood summer only to enhance the shape of the deviant creature I had worshipped my entire life. The flies around her corpse buzzed with excitement. Her long black rusted nails filled with worms and care,  slowly rearranged my hair behind my ear as if to offer me a second of peace before witnessing hell itself.

I slowly raised my head to face her, finally. 

To my dismay it was a monstrosity too grotesque to comprehend, a black greasy mass made with sticks and bones oozing a blood like matter let us see a wide and empty rib cage.

 Her black skeleton looked too thin to carry the outpouring stomach under her large “waist”. seemingly thrown with disregards inside of her.  The little skin over her bones waving to the flow of the larvaes hidden under. The statue laid on a dozen pairs of necrosed legs.

And finally her face.

A beautiful and calm young woman's head, eyes opened, symmetrically cracked open floated. Dotted with few and thin sticky black hair dripping  on her shoulder. On its inside was a beating organ made of a  sack of flesh dotted with eyes,  pushing each other just to stare at my soul. 

Paralyzed, only my eyes could escape and laid on her stomach. From which let appeared a perfectly round and shiny silver plate sat on a red and smooth pulsing flesh. 

I gather all my strength to scream but only a desperate and frail  

“I’m so sorry, It’s the last time, I promise…Please”

I felt the black veil brushing over my legs and with it a black goo imprinting its pattern on the cracked  wooden floor.  The sound of dripping water and broken bones filled my ears,  as if she was thumping on your spine with no regard for your sorrow, crushing parts of herself in the process. She used her nail to open the cage and reached for Lewis. 

She gently placed it in the center of her carcass and let the flesh slowly engulf him. I could feel the eyes judging me, she pointed at the cage and Lewis was there, I looked back at him with a mixture of joy and disgust and as my eyes came back to her she vanished. 

She had given me another chance.

I got expelled from school because of the noise. Lewis was rolling so fast his fur melted with the background, without realizing it I had not left my room in weeks and the squeaking turned into an industrial complex. Some said you could hear it from the 5th floor, I was near the basement. 

I packed the little I own and got ready to leave, until the phone rang.

"Grandma loves you and she needs you, Mike needs you."

I could hear her smile through the phone.

"Mike ?" 

...

"Hello ? Mom ?"

The line cut and Lewis stopped rolling, he was completely fine and back to his youthful form, the tumor was gone. I sat grateful and scared, I had no other choice. I had to go back home. 

I had  not slept in 3 days due to a growing pain in my stomach, somehow the constant vibrations of my seat rocked me to sleep. A simple question kept coming back, why did he need me? He had not called in months and would certainly not turn to my parents for any help. He prided himself in always finding his own way, a passion or skill and  I envied him greatly for it.  I have spent my entire life thinking I’d save the world, now what ? I had a constant  nosebleed and lost some of my teeth ? 

My phone rang, it was Mike. He whispered rapidly.

“Don’t come home, I beg yo-..”

“What do you mean ? I’m on my way, mom called”

“For once stop fucking listening to them”

I could hear somebody else behind him, a much older voice.

“Is that a phone ? Does it work here ? Give it to me ! ”

A fight broke between them  and before I could even say a word, the line cut.

I tried to call home but nobody answered.

I arrived around 5 in the morning, which offered the most transcending view.  Orange mountains dressed in a sparkly white coat reflecting the timid head of the sun. A moment of inner peace blossomed as Lewis climbed on my shoulder.  It would be the last time I enjoyed this place. I stretched my legs and fed Lewis.  The trail from the bus station to Mike’s shed was about an hour long. I could spend some time with him and be home by noon. 

Lost deep in the woods, the tiny cabin seemed to pull away with each step I took. The large and elongated trees blocked all the light I could hope for. The decrepit door crumbled under my hand as I touched the soggy  handle. I slowly opened the door trying to catch a look inside before entering. Somehow it was cooler inside as if the cabin had its own gust of wind.  The wooden floor was drenched. So was the table, the bed, anything but his desk .The gloomy and cold room smelled like a pond on a hot summer day. But most importantly, Mike was nowhere to be found. 

His keys and wallet next to his bed and food on the table meant he had left in a hurry, he must have been terrified. He had endured so much loss and disrespect and always kept a straight face.  I’ve only seen him scared once, he was 10 years old and had just finished a lesson with grandma this time, her true form maybe. After that he rejected every teaching, alone in his room all day. He kicked and screamed during the blessings and pretty soon was running away for days and sometimes weeks. 

On his desk were neatly arranged stacks of papers and a deck of tarot cards. I turned the light on and the walls were covered in dozens of articles and cut out pictures of random people. One mentioned the apparition of Lake Isaac in 1972 and  another Lake Tammy in 2005, particularly frightening as during a winter night it flooded 2 houses and claimed the lives of everyone inside. Another mentioning a strange occurrence at a nearby town in 1989, a mother about to give birth brought with her 37 people. They threw a gigantic tantrum as some were crying, scared of missing the birth. Once the baby was given to the mother the audience came in, as soon as the baby started crying the people joined in and laid on the floor. Loud wailings from adults imitating a baby could be heard across the  hallways . Hands over their chest and rolling around, crying. The baby stopped as it was gasping for air, the mother screamed for help and the guests held their breath. The police soon arrived and some were arrested for misconduct and insult to a government official. The pile of paper was actually a book that Mike printed : “Seaweed: The Symbiose of The Cells” written by a supposed scientist named Bill Pines. 

At first I wanted to remove it all and bring it to my parents, I was angry at him, at me. All I could think about was the baby. I was supposed to be the only one, not copied but mirrored for my greatness and our friends could be her grandchildren through me. I came in for answers and left with more questions and pain than I could imagine.

 The ball of pain inside my stomach was now moving, I folded as sweat rained on my forehead. The metallic taste of blood brushed my teeth and covered my tongue, another tooth fell out. I ran out the woods as fast as I could, holding Lewis on my shoulder.  

Sweaty and out of breath, I was finally there. As I rose my head up the large black house in ruins on the hill looked down on me, fear making its way in my body as I walked the narrow path. The roaring pain in my stomach on the other hand was much quieter now.

I rang the sticky door bell waiting for the worst. 

“Oh sweetheart”

My mother had an endearing look I’ve never seen, as if she missed me.

“Where is Mike ?”

“What’s wrong sweetheart ?”

“Where is he mom ?”

“What did he say sweetheart ?”

“Nothing, I have not talked to him in months, can I come in ?”

Her nice deeminer turned into a sour grin.

“Of course.”

After the fear, nausea took the front seat. The endless yellow walls of the many hallways blurred my vision, the good old rancid smell of decomposition emanated from it and took over my nose. I could hold my cough and the wooden floor seemed to expand as we walked. I can hardly believe these were good conditions for children.

“He was not at the cabin.”

“Good for him”

I stopped with despair. 

“There was another baby ? I mean another me ?”

“Grandma loves you and you have disappointed her, you are the only thing that matters to her ! How dare you question the place she gave you ?”

“She abused me, made me eat my pets and now makes me sick ! What place is this ? ”

Eyes wide open her dry bony finger pointed in my direction. Her look was now stern and deprived of any love.

“What. Did. He. Say. To. You ?”

With tears coming down my eyes I timidly looked at the floor. 

“I should not come home”

“And here you are, move along.”

We kept on going in between the many hallways lit by the same golden chandeliers. Turning left and right whenever she wanted the paths seemed to multiply everytime we took a turn. Until the gathering room door appeared. A gigantic white wooden gate encrusted in symbols, 7 of them to be exact. The 7 layers of the soul represent the different level of commitment to grandma or so I taught.

I stopped as I could not stop crying.

“Why don’t you care ?”

“He is already with her.”

“What ? What did you do ?”

For the first time I rushed in front of her face and screamed.

“Why did you do this to me ? You tortured me and used me for your sick rituals”

“The thing in your stomach ? It’s gone isn’t it ?”

She gently wiped my tears and hugged me. I froze in her arms and in an instant I became that kid again. Getting reassured after each session with a warm hug and compliments.

“You are the successor, they will obey and bow to you. We’ve worked so hard sweetheart”

She let go of the embrace and went back to her usual form, cold and focused. The doors opened for us and grandma was waiting. Crossed-legs on the couch covered by her black veil, only a skeletal necrosed finger slowly pierced through and pointed at a wooden chair under the golden chandelier.

I knew I had to sit and get ready for another lesson. The last one ever since.

As always I would have to close my eyes and repeat the same mantra over and over again. gripping the chair, my voice shaking as I was scared to mess up.

“I will be the fool forever and always longing for your mercy, I will hang from the the tree of your desires, I will seek for you at every turn as you embody my truth, I will be the vessel for your wise words, I will give birth to his offspring and carry them through ascendance, I will accept my fate if the world is not shape for you, I will be for him and only him.

My mother kept repeating the mantra while forcing food in my mouth, I spat it out realizing Lewis was long gone.

“Don’t stop” 

Yelled my mother amused and extatic.

As I repeated myself I wept loudly, I swallowed the little I could trying to forget the texture as much as possible,  my feet were now leaving the floor and I could see it pulling away from me. I never levitated before. I dropped the chair and felt my back sticking to the ceiling, first my fingers contorted forming 5 turned back spirals so my nails could touch the back of my hand. My right arm twisted on itself twice and miserably hung from my shoulder. As for my left arm, my elbow cracked open and got in between the back of my neck. Each bone in my legs broke, from my toes to my hips as if a raging horse was attached to it. Soon each nerve in my body pulsed. My face  was a distorted statue , a monstrous canvas capturing the excruciating pain. Only my eyes could move glancing around the room for safety, only tears and snot meant I was alive.

“Mark ! She is doing it for good !”

My father rushed into the room applauding me.

“We are so proud sweetheart, you have no idea” 

I was used to the contortion as most of the teachings revolved around it, but I could have never imagined where it would lead me to. I stayed in the position for a week or maybe a month, the sunlight being my only notion of time. Somehow she was always here, silent and immobile.

My mother entered the room crying, she kneeled towards the couch head on the floor

“Please High Priestess, I beg for your forgiveness, mercy and love. I will be led to him though you graciously,  Please mother I beg, please let her ascend and meet him.”  Grandma pointed her finger at me and my mother ran out the room. Suddenly the walls got closer to me, I looked down and Grandma was gone. The walls had now turned into a narrow hallway, the room had recited so much that my contorted body was recluding on itself. I was able to breathe and move freely now. For some reason I pushed as hard as I could in hopes to save what was left of myself. I was stuck in about 18 inches of yellow concrete trying to find an escape. I pressed the wall facing me with two feet and felt it move, I gave on last strike and the wall dropped. So did I. 

I landed on a perfectly set dining table, the forks and shards of glass cutting me in the process. I laid there appreciating that my body went back to normal. The walls were covered in wood and the small squared windows were covered with deep green curtains. The light came from a naked white lamp on the ceiling. Old paintings of goats covered the room.

 I sat on the table, ate the food and pulled out my phone and had no signal. I ran out of the room only to find the exact same room, but it was raining inside this time. I ran out and still, the same room but the goats were now cats. In the next the windows were now opened and people were roaming around seemingly lost and disheveled. I kept opening the same doors and now the people were trying to climb through the window. I stopped as in this dining room  the windows were shut. I sat down and accepted my delusions. Mike was right. I should not have come back home, it was a trap for their unnecessary worship. I cried again apologizing to Lewis at the same time when suddenly the handle of the door moved, someone was coming in. A yellow mass presented itself to me, a man in a hazmat suit.
