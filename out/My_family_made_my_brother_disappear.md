If I had to tell you about my brother I'd apologise first, the last few years have been a blur to me, but before I left Mike was the most educated person I've ever known.

Lost in his books , questioning god at every turn and always arguing about the last sentence you said and the meaning of the words you used. After he graduated as a valedictorian my parents stopped convincing  him to come to church and removed all his pictures in the house. 

Needless to say our last family's Christmas meeting was a sour play in which I was the tree witnessing my mother clutching her pearls and apologizing to our friends and family. 

Mike came in late as usual, he would always blame it on his research but I knew he never liked the opening ceremony, which consisted of kneeling for grandma and letting her bless you. I always did it, with faith at first but as time passed it became more of a formality.

A daily ritual in honor of a grandmother to whom I've never seen the face. 

I remember vividly trying to catch her move from the couch, opening the door just enough so my right eye could see through the slit. Her black embroidered veil hiding every inch of her spread on the deep green couch clashed with the yellow stained wall. The windows were screwed shut and only  the golden chandelier over her head could not pierce through the black mass containing her from the real world.  and somehow I could feel her eyes staring at me. 

A few more friends joined in and kneeled, Mike chuckled and turned to me :

"How long are they staying this time ?"  

My father, in his unfitting suit,  stood up with less ease than the previous years, his red nose from the wine seemed to be leading his drunken dance, his big hands pulsing from a far as he finally grabbed a chair to help himself and with disdain, said :

"You need to leave, I mean it this time." 

Mike gathered his belongings in a mourning silence that spread across the table, my mother forced a smile to her friends.  All these years of supposed happiness within the "truth" couldn't refrain a single tear falling from her eye as her only son left for good.

Somehow I was relieved,  he chuckled the last I saw him when he had no business to, he had not called in months and the only updates were sporadic pictures of him looking rough in front of lakes across the globe. His demineer and look painted the shadow of a once hopeful and sarcastic kid. All I remember was his shaky voice and rumbles as he seemed to have lost his mind.

My parents had ruined his life by paying for online campaigns to make him lose all credibility on his research.  Turns out a  lot of wanna-be intellectuals would gladly take a check to prove if god is real or not.  He blew all his  funds into his lake chase and had no other options than to return to our home town. He began to work as a park ranger, he told that he needed to settle down, that the serenity of the forest would ease some wounds. But I suspected otherwise, the national park and grandiose landscape surrounding our village was known for its abnormal number of lakes. Sometimes forming and disappearing overnight, it became a local attraction. A simple explanation was given, we were located over really sensitive tectonic plates hitting each other  once or twice every two years. I had tried to ask him more about his obsession but he would not say a word. He knew I would report it back to grandma.

Right after Mike was shunned I had left to study films in New York and failed. The loneliness and work took most of my time and my parents learned that I may or may not respect one of my grandma's rules. To be honest I felt like an empty little statue my entire life,  fed to be kept alive. Homeschooled for most of it, I could not recall ever seeing another kid besides Mike or ever going to a playground. All I remember is being promised a “bright future and a joyful ascendance”, but only if I strictly followed my grandma’s teaching. 

Despite the loneliness I was loved and cared for, all of our friends would come by to drop food and toys. As for Mike, he did not receive the same attention nor care as he often ran away, and according to my mother showed signs of ”defaillance”, he was sent to public school and thus would miss a lot of ceremonies. 

At 20 the teaching stopped and I was deemed ready for the outside world, thanks to our friends I received tapes then DVD’s and later on a camera. Films became my only comfort in which I could project myself into the real world. I rarely cried, barely laughed and never enjoyed conversing too long and now I wanted to. 

Pretty soon I became an even emptier shell. The shock , the differences  and the lies of the outside world wrapped around my mind so tight I could feel each of my synapses about to explode and an intense heat everytime I missed a blessing call from Home. The idea of betraying grandma and locking myself out of bliss was an unfathomable option, I had worked so hard and broken so many bones to get there. The guilt came over me when I realised I had disobeyed the golden rule.

 "Own a rat, Feed the rat, Eat the rat." 

A process that must be repeated every two years but as soon as I arrived in the City a new world opened to me, for the first time I had prioritized myself, another strict rule I had violated. I never thought anything of it until the first symptoms showed up.

After another meaningless one night stand with my lonelier neighbour Jeremy I left earlier than usual, an engulfing heat awoke me, I could feel my inside pulsing and  my blood boiling. I ran in the cold with only a t-shirt and unfitting shorts.

The questions multiplied faster than the snow hitting my face. Shame sticking on me colder than the wind itself, I got  distracted to the point of going home head down. Retracing the steps from memory I bumped into  an old limping man along the way. I briefly stopped and apologized, he gave me a gentle look , then a creepy smile slowly opening his mouth to let drool come out. I turned around and left.

The pavement seems to flow under my feet, somehow the blend floor reassured me and cut me from my thoughts. Until I noticed the same crack appearing on the left side corner. At first they all seemed different from each other. The guilt turned into fear. For the first time I had grasped the severity of my negligence. I decided to count my steps and focused on finding a rat.

“1 , 2 , 3.”

The people were long gone and the silence settled again. The cars were in the same exact position as I started running. And now the buildings were the same.  

“A blue doctor’s office, a green pharmacy, and a yellow pet store”

The endless silent loop got broken by a rusty cane hitting the floor, the same man appeared, I stopped as he bumped into me intentionally this time. I apologised again. He did not look at me but kept smiling. An unstoppable smile, offering a disastrous spectacle. His yellow teeth detach embedded in a  foaming red substance as he tilts his head up. His empty eye sockets fixing me, he removed his jacket and hat and gently rested them on the gloomy doctor’s office facade.

“It’s all worth it”

He looked around him and joined the middle of the road. Kissing an invisible crowd, already bending to accept the grace of the audience, as if he had already won their hearts. His eyeless look stared directly at me. He started to mime. A crying man enters a home, slowly removing his shoes, closing the blinds, checking through the door, breaking his phone , grabbing a stool, fixing a cord on the ceiling. 

My stomach turned as he gasped for air, smiling. His melted hands pierced his throat. The non existent cord seemingly tightening under his weight. Flowing graciously and committed to the role he covered his face with a hideous sack of rotten flesh once called hands. Only to surprise me again with fewer teeth than before inches from my face. 

I left as fast I could, the crack was still the same. My feet hurt more each step, the tissue of my socks digging a burning hole on my tendons. 

Tears rolled down my face as home seemed like a distant memory. A pain on my left rib spiked me and I had no choice but to stop and sit. I leaned against a building  trying to understand the source of the pain. The image of the desperate clown imprinted on my eyelids, I knew she was now threatening me, she knew I wanted to leave and could not handle her long lasting dream.

 As I gathered my thoughts I looked around to locate myself, all I could feel was the strangers strong looks. Still I was grateful for their presence and noise.

 A young mother and her child approached.

“Mommy I want that one” said the kid pointing at a fish in the shopping window.

The woman kneels next to me.

“Are you okay ? Are you running away from somebody ? Do you need me to call someone ?”

Somehow I could not answer any of her questions and her multitudes of solutions seemed more like trouble than anything else.

I simply nodded yes and went into the store. All I needed was a rat and if grandma had led me here she might give me a second chance. I decided to buy the first rat I saw, always white with bloodshot eyes,  from a lab preferably. 

 Shaky and confused I threw all the cash I had left on the counter and ran home.

At 6 I owned an immortal one named Ratus, "immortal" as in my mom was probably changing it every two years. I remember the taste of these suspicious meals and the putrid smell of decaying meat oozing from the kitchen. It was a well presented stew with beans and grilled diced meat, my mom called it "The day that never ends". Our friends were well dressed for once and the blinds were screwed shut the night before and no light could come in. Over fifty souls cramped up around the dining table gathered around to watch us eat, some climbed on furniture, some became violent, only to take a look. To mimic any of our movements.

In a deep silence only  the deem light of the candles could reflect the adoration and excitement in their eyes. The room got full so they covered the wall of the hallway until grandma's door. 

As we finished the food my father arrived and ordered anyone who is not touching the wall with their back to leave. They all rushed, ripping each other’s clothes in the process. Just to slow themselves down. The gruntings and animalistic rage was echoed by my mother’s euphoria, smiling, for real.

“Get your ticket Tammy !”

My father  shoved the one deemed not chosen outside and ordered everyone back to the wall to hold  hands. He blew off the candle and the gates of the gathering room opened.

 Grandma would finally come out to eat.

Lewis was his new name, next to the window the little ball of fur was indiscernible from the snow, he became my only friend and I became the girl with a rat. People thinking you live in the sewer doesnt help for social interaction so Lewis took most of my time,  he was hiding in my pockets and I knitted little hats in between a love island episode and a good crying session. 

 I even forgot about Mike and his adventures.

And then came the time, The grey clouds pierced by the dark blue sky painted Lewis’s calm sleep. Laid over my sweater in between my shoulder and my neck, his breathing slowed down and his petite stature could not carry the tumor that grew on his neck. 

2 years had passed since I got him and now  I was watching the void with despair as my drowned eyes could not stop time. I was losing the only witness to my true form, the only eyes who never judged. I placed him in the palm of my left hand and gently expressed a silent gratitude, rubbing his tiny head one last time.

   I put him back in his cage, refilled his water and turned on the creep cast "The Left Right Game" episode that dropped on my birthday. The grief and the coincidence intrigued me and pretty soon the show and  sadness melted into a fog severing me from reality.

I went back to check on Lewis and almost 4 hours had passed and I missed the right time to prepare him the right way according to my mother. I turned around my room debating between calling my mom or eating him, I could not tell her I failed nor eat my best friend. I had learned that nobody in their sane mind would ever do such things to their pets.

I took a shower and some pills to push the pain away. No amount of drugs or loud music could turn off my brain as I retraced my day endlessly. Once again I had failed but this time only grandma could save it.

Suddenly the squeaking of Lewis's  wheel missed me so much I replayed it to sleep as if to celebrate the fact that from now on I would only slowly forget it.

I felt it appearing slowly in my ear, nursing me through my tears. It was constant as if weight was on it. In a second the noise of the city was shut off by the sound of metal ripping itself to shreds, it was real I could hear it awake. And despite it all I felt safe.

 The same exact sound ticking in my ear was now a loud roar in the room , the high frequency bounced through the wall, my ear started ringing and now I could barely stand up. As if lightning passed through my head.  Lewis was turning on the wheel faster and faster, his eyes tracking me around the room, his little palm over his nose as to mock me for not caring enough, I gasped in silence, tears rolling down my eyes. I closed them with all the strength I had left.

What have I done ? 

The walls had turned yellow and stained, the silence had frozen every atom possibly existent. I could feel her over my shoulder, her hot and acid breath radiating on my face. Followed by a  moist and dense atmosphere. The golden chandelier was casting a warm ray reminiscent of a childhood summer only to enhance the shape of the deviant creature I had worshipped my entire life. The flies around her corpse buzzed with excitement. Her long black rusted nails filled with worms and care,  slowly rearranged my hair behind my ear as if to offer me a second of peace before witnessing hell itself.

I slowly raised my head to face her, finally. 

To my dismay it was a monstrosity too grotesque to comprehend, a black greasy mass made with sticks and bones oozing a blood like matter let us see a wide and empty rib cage.

 Her black skeleton looked too thin to carry the outpouring stomach under her large “waist”. seemingly thrown with disregards inside of her.  The little skin over her bones waving to the flow of the larvaes hidden under. The statue laid on a dozen pairs of necrosed legs.

And finally her face.

A beautiful and calm young woman's head, eyes opened, symmetrically cracked open floated. Dotted with few and thin sticky black hair dripping  on her shoulder. On its inside was a beating organ made of a  sack of flesh dotted with eyes,  pushing each other just to stare at my soul. 

Paralyzed, only my eyes could escape and laid on her stomach. From which let appeared a perfectly round and shiny silver plate sat on a red and smooth pulsing flesh. 

I gather all my strength to scream but only a desperate and frail  

“I’m so sorry, It’s the last time, I promise…Please”

I felt the black veil brushing over my legs and with it a black goo imprinting its pattern on the cracked  wooden floor.  The sound of dripping water and broken bones filled my ears,  as if she was thumping on your spine with no regard for your sorrow, crushing parts of herself in the process. She used her nail to open the cage and reached for Lewis. 

She gently placed it in the center of her carcass and let the flesh slowly engulf him. I could feel the eyes judging me, she pointed at the cage and Lewis was there, I looked back at him with a mixture of joy and disgust and as my eyes came back to her she vanished. 

She had given me another chance.

I got expelled from school because of the noise. Lewis was rolling so fast his fur melted with the background, without realizing it I had not left my room in weeks and the squeaking turned into an industrial complex. Some said you could hear it from the 5th floor, I was near the basement. 

I packed the little I own and got ready to leave, until the phone rang.

"Grandma loves you and she needs you, Mike needs you."

I could hear her smile through the phone.

"Mike ?" 

...

"Hello ? Mom ?"

The line cut and Lewis stopped rolling, he was completely fine and back to his youthful form, the tumor was gone. I sat grateful and scared, I had no other choice. I had to go back home.
