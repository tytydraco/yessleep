I had a really weird experience yesterday and I have been thinking about it a lot, I want to write it out to help process it. I know this is a forum for creative writing but this really happened to me and I thought this sub would enjoy, believe me if you like. (Pls lmk if there are subs for true scary stories)

I was scrolling Twitter before I got out of bed yesterday morning and I came across a thread from some random poster - this person was talking about the /x/ board on 4chan, a board for discussion of paranormal stuff. The poster was saying that 99% of posts on there were nothing special or even interesting, but they did one time see an image that made them physically recoil, made them feel horrible psychologically, and made them see 'violent images' in their head for days. Supposedly the effects all wore off after a few days.

I was immediately suuuper curious. I wondered if digging for this image was actually a good idea or not, but quickly realized that it didn't matter, I was just too curious. Anyway, based on some clues the original person had inadvertently left on their Twitter page, I was able to find the pic. It was definitely creepy, maybe even a little scary. But I definitely didn't physically recoil, or have any kind of lasting negative effects. I wouldn't exactly set it as my phone wallpaper though lol.

This image is relatively easy to find if you know what to search for, but be warned that some people genuinely complained about having that kind of overwhelming negative experience after seeing it. Funnily enough, it was actually published in a book by a French philosopher once (the last book he published before he died, spooky ðŸ˜±).

The trouble came when I went to 4chan to investigate the /x/ board. After seeing the image that the Twitter poster was talking about, and not feeling much, I was emboldened to keep researching I guess. The original thread on Twitter was getting a lot of traction, and someone had made a thread on 4chan about the thread on Twitter. In this 4chan thread there was a lot of discussion about 'infohazards' or 'cognitohazards': things that can harm you just by seeing / understanding them. This thread on 4chan is where I found an image like that.

--- my advice ---

I would advise not to seek out any infohazards. Obviously saying that will only make some people more curious, but please at least read about my reaction (below) before you go searching. I also totally realise that this post sounds fake as hell, but I promise it really happened yesterday morning.

--- my reaction ---

Basically, I was scrolling through the replies, and expanded one of the images. I glanced at it for only a second (2 seconds at absolute most), and suddenly felt a physical and psychological reaction. I felt a sudden and intense pressure/tightness in my chest, which lasted for as long as I looked at the image. I have never had any cardiological issues before, but I would imagine it felt something like the first moments of a heart attack. I also felt an overwhelming negative psychological effect that could best be characterised as intense fear. I sat up straight away and tossed my laptop across my bed, so I couldn't see the screen. My heart was beating pretty fast. I got up straight away, closed the tab in my browser. I thought to myself "that's enough internet for today!" I started pacing back and forth in my room. The physical effect only lasted as long as I was looking at the image, but the psychological effect remained longer. I was in an intensely negative state of mind. I also felt a rush of adrenaline, considering I had been lying in bed one minute and then having a full blown reaction the next. Maybe because of the adrenaline or maybe to distract myself, I compulsively started doing pushups. I quickly realised I needed to go do something else, and get myself out of that headspace. Read below for the aftermath.


--- the image ---

So the image itself was weird. Someone had turned the 'offensive image' into a four panel meme - very on brand for 4chan lol. The first panel was a guy sitting by a laptop, then a panel of him peering into his laptop screen with a devious look on his face. The third panel was the offensive image, and the fourth was the same guy, blank expression, blood running from one nostril. The offensive image itself was actually not of any thing at all. I can best describe it as a yellow, abstract shape, like a vertical gust of wind, laid over a sky background. Sorry but I'm no good at drawing so I wouldn't be able to represent it well enough. It was obviously digitally created because it wasn't a real photo, but it was in a realistic style (not drawn/cartoonish or something else). Whether the offensive image would be dangerous on its own, outside of this 4 panel meme, I don't really know. But I only started feeling the reaction that I felt when I looked at this offensive image. The other panels did not make me feel anything, but maybe primed me to feel the reaction I did.


--- the aftermath ---

I knew I wanted to distract myself, get myself into a better state of mind. I put on a comfy/funny YouTube video (shoutout kitboga), and went to pat my cat who was laying in the sun. After a couple mins I was wondering if it was all in my head, or if it was a coincidence that I had felt something come over me when I happened to open that image, but then I realised that the fact I was still 'coming down' from the experience meant that it couldn't have been just in my head. I'm sure in retrospect that I was primed for this reaction by reading about all the negative effects that other people had after seeing the first image (the creepy one from twitter). But that didn't make it less real.

I realized that I could picture the image I saw in my head just fine, with no negative consequences (thank god for that). I thought it was really weird that physically viewing it was dangerous but not imagining/remembering it.

After 5 mins or so of patting my cat and watching YouTube, I thought to myself, yeah, it must have been something, since it took me 5 mins for the immediacy to wear off. But when I checked the YouTube video, it had actually been playing for closer to 15-20 mins. I thought that was really odd.

After 20 mins I was 90% good, after 1 hour I was 98% good. Which is freaking crazy considering I only glanced at this image for less than 2 secs. I did feel just a little off at random points throughout the rest of the day, especially when tired before bed, but otherwise mostly unphased.

One weird thing was, I seemed to be forgetting about it quickly. Like if I hadn't have thought it was so weird to come across a real life cognitive hazard, I would have probably forgotten about it by the end of the day, even after having the reaction that I did. Part of that is because I made an effort to not dwell on it and to distract myself immediately afterwards, but I could sense that the experience was fading in my memory just the same way as any other image / thread on social media does over the course of one's day.

Now, the next day, I am 100% good again, but I will absolutely not go searching for that image (or any other) again.

--- my analysis ---

have you ever seen those videos of cats suddenly jumping when they turn around and see a cucumber? I think this is kind of like that in some way. When the cat first sees the cucumber, they immediately jump away out of fright, because they look so similar to a snake. But then immediately afterwards, they realise it's just a vegetable. I think this speaks to how our brains work in some way - our brain can cause some visceral reaction to something, be it positive or negative, before we actually realise what it is that we're looking at, a tenth of a second later.

This is what the experience felt like to me - some visceral reaction to seeing this image before I had even parsed what it was. I think this also explains why I was able to imagine it afterwards without any harm.

I can't help but wonder if the spell would be broken if I looked at the image for more than just a glance, but I'm definitely not going to try!

The implications for this are pretty terrifying though. What if a malicious actor hacked into a tv station and put this image on everyone's tv? I think at least a few old people may die. Imagine if tiktok got hacked, and everyone was exposed to the image when they opened the app? Imagine if apple got hacked, and every iPhone had it set as their lock screen wallpaper overnight? That's some real life supervillain shit.

This whole experience has got me thinking, what if there is an opposite effect? Is it possible to create an image which creates bliss for someone when they see it? Maybe you could argue that adult material does this, but maybe it's possible to do something similar without explicit imagery? Who knows.

For everyone's sake, please don't post any images in the comments of this thread. If you want to go searching, that's your prerogative, but don't make everyone else see something potentially harmful!

Anyway, thanks for reading I guess.
