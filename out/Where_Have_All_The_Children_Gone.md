I was 13 years old, it was 1985 and I was on the school bus. I was a diehard Smiths fan, so I was listening to "Back to the Old House". I lived in a pretty normal neighborhood, downtown manhatten. This may not be the scariest story of all time so if you're looking for something bigger I don't reccoment this, anyways, around 25 minutes after I got onto the bus, there was a crash. I don't know if there was any time for any of the children to get off, but once I opened my eyes there was nobody on the bus. Where had all the children gone? Where had all the children gone? A horrible sentence that sent chills down my spine every time I think about it. I got off the bus, and there were two men outside, like they were waiting for me. They stuffed me into a bag, almost like they knew exactly how tall I was, it was perfectly fit for me. I was 5'7, normally you'd kidnap a smaller child, maybe 5'2.

I don't know how long they walked for. And yes, they WALKED, but fortunately we finally got to a house, where they dumped me out onto a sofa. I had no idea what they would do next, I was just THIRTEEN years old. *What are they going to do to me? Where am I? I just want my mom back man..* Were all thoughts that wouldn't leave my head. I can't imagine what my parents thought at that time. They didn't do anything sexual, which is odd. Whats the point of kidnapping a kid then? They weren't the smartest people alive, and they left me on the sofa without anything to stop me from running away or yelling. I managed to slip out a window and I was shaking so hard. There was a school bus, but this time it was full of adults. These adults looked like they were crazy, but at the time I just needed help. They all looked like messed up repeats of eachother. Bunny teeth, bald, white, and the way they all moved was horrifiying. One of these men smilled at me. I hope nobody EVER has to see a smile like that, but at the time, that smile was just what I needed, I felt welcomed, safe.

If you ever see them, please, please, please, whatever you do, do NOT look them in the eyes. One by one, I looked them in the eyes, and each and every one of them smiled. A bone chilling smile. They widened their eyes, but the bus driver, he was normal. They all stared at me, where ever I went, there they were looking. Honestly, I wanted to kill myself at that time. I was so scared. *Where have all the children gone? Where have all the children gone?* I couldn't help, but think, were these the children? I banged so hard on that door. So. Fucking. Hard.

I got out. I was on the street running, running, I didn't live far from where I was, and my parents let me outside of the house, the place looked, odly futiristic. I got to my apartment building, opened the door, and rushed to my apartment. The key? Didn't work?.. I paused. I knocked. An answer. "Hello? How can I help you?" The woman greeting me said, but she didn't look like my mother. "Hey, I um, sorry whats today?" I asked, foolishly. "Oh! Friday October 13th, 2023." She replied. I ran so fast. *TWENTY-TWENTY THREE?? TWO-THOUSAND TWENTY THREE??* I spent days, outside, feeling suicidal. But of course, I'll just have to get used to the fact that possibly I switched dimentions.

You may start to think to yourself if YOU'RE safe. Honestly? Who knows. All I know is that it's 1985 and this is some sort of lie. Please help me. I don't know what to do, this happened just the other day ago. Friday the 13th. Maybe superstitions are real.  Today, October 26th, 1985, or now, 2023. I've been living all alone for days, terrified. *Where have all the children gone?*
