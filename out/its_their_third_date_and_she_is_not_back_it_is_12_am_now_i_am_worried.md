Stacy  
I was in my room listening to music when I heard my mom calling me downstairs. I walked down, already suspecting what was about to happen. Mrs. Watson would be at the door, asking me to watch Zack for a few hours while she went on a date with some guy whose name I didn’t care to remember—it was still too new to matter. Sure enough, there she was at the door.

“Hi, Callie,” I said.

“Listen, Stacy, I’m going on a date today with that guy I told you about—the one I met at the coffee shop,” she said.

“Okay, so you need me to keep an eye on Zack until you’re back, right?” I asked.

“Please, Stacy. Do this for me today, and I’ll make you those pancakes you love so much if I come home early,” she said, flashing a hopeful smile.

“I do love those pancakes, but come on, it’s your third date. There’s no way you’re coming home early tonight,” I teased.

“Nothing is going to happen tonight,” she said, though her smile betrayed her. It was clear she was hoping otherwise. After all, she’d been single for five years since her husband died in the military. Zack, now fourteen, was finally old enough that she felt comfortable dating again.

I went back to my room and started searching for a horror movie to watch with Zack that evening.

Around 7 o’clock, I headed over to Mrs. Watson’s house. She left for her date, and Zack and I spent two hours watching a movie. By 9 o’clock, I called her.

“You’re not coming home early, are you?” I asked sarcastically.

“It’s not like that,” she replied. “The restaurant didn’t seat us for two hours, even though we had a reservation. We finally got our table, but we’re going to be late. Just order some takeout—I’ll Venmo you the money.”

I ordered food, and when it arrived, I told Zack to join me at the table for dinner. As we ate, Zack asked, “Is Mom going to be late?”

“Yeah,” I replied.

“Do you think they’ll have sex tonight?”

“Don’t ask me that,” I said, trying to sound stern.

“I think they will.”

“I think so too,” I admitted, and we both laughed.

By 10:30, I called Mrs. Watson again.

“When are you coming home? This isn’t funny anymore,” I said, annoyed.

“We’ll be late. Why don’t you just sleep in Zack’s room tonight? Please,” she begged.

“Fine,” I muttered and hung up, furious. I wanted to be back at my house, scrolling on my phone until I fell asleep, but now I had to make sure Zack went to bed. Luckily, he fell asleep almost as soon as he laid down. Finally, I could scroll on my phone for a bit before dozing off myself.

At around midnight, I heard the front door open. I quickly turned off my phone and pretended to be asleep. I heard footsteps—two sets—coming upstairs. Someone was definitely going to get lucky tonight.

The door to Zack’s room creaked open. Mrs. Watson peeked in to check on us. Satisfied that we were asleep, she left, and I imagined her whispering to her date to join her in her room for some... private time. I heard their door lock.

Then, suddenly, a gunshot echoed from Mrs. Watson’s room.

Frozen in terror, I listened as footsteps—heavy and deliberate—approached Zack’s room.
