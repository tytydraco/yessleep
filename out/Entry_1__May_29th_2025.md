Entry 1 - May 29th 2025

My name is August Walker.

I have been on this earth for 39 years, the last four of which I have spent in prison. I’m not quite sure what the point of me writing this down is. Perhaps my subconscious knows it will help me keep my sanity. Maybe my adjusting body is constantly needing something to do. I just think I need somebody to talk to. Unfortunately this is the best that I have.

Currently, I am sitting atop an office building, writing in Vern’s notebook. I’m staring down into the quiet city. The soft wind feels nice up here. I feel so free. I am no longer bound to the lonely cell that has been my abode for the last four years. A couple days ago I was released, but under extremely unusual circumstances. I hope writing this all down helps me. If the internet is still working – and I finally decide to try it – I may post this online. Maybe try to reach some people. Anyway, before I forget the details, let's get started.

——————————————————————————————————————————

I had shared McNally Correctional Facility with six other prisoners. None of which I would call my friends. It’s amazing how you can passively live next to someone for years, five inches of concrete separating you, and still hate them with a growing spite every day. 

We all gave each other space, which wasn’t hard considering the prison was built to hold at least 500 residents. We would only see each other during meal times, entering and exiting our cells, and the off chance that we would pass each other on our way to repeat our same, boring activities every day. Our cell block was on the fourth floor, with railings surrounding the edge of a tall drop that would certainly injure, if not kill, anyone who tried jumping.

If you weren’t able to keep your sanity in this massive asylum, the guards would lock you away in solitary confinement. They had done so to a prisoner before I had arrived, locking him away because “talking to himself was considered psychopathic.” The officers would tease us with it, telling us that if we stepped out of line, we wouldn’t see the light of day again.

Just in case all of it was true, I did my best to keep myself grounded in reality. One thing that helped keep my sanity was the methodical ticking of a clock at the top of the stairs, just out of sight. It put me at ease and helped clear my mind. I don’t think I would have lasted if it hadn’t been for that clock.

Maybe ten words a month were spoken between all of us, mostly swears. Over four years, with bits from the guards’ chatter, we pieced together each other’s stories. Rook had a wife, trying to form a legal case to prove he was innocent of his arson charge. Cale had nothing left to lose and attempted to murder a man on the street to feel something again. Aaron hacked multiple banks, but the cops caught him in the middle of one of his raids. David and Julie ran a human trafficking ring for a couple years before one slip up landed them in McNally. Josh was hit with multiple weapons charges after selling firearms to underage teens. And me, August. I was dropped into my cold cell for manslaughter after a drunk night at a bar. A night I don’t quite remember. A night that I thought would change the course of my life.

Little did I know it would only shape the next four years.

My stomach inexplicably started doing flips one day at the prison. Under my breath I cursed the guard who had thrown up yesterday. I took my meals to my cell, but left them in the corner, focusing on keeping last night’s dinner in my stomach. 

I had no trouble falling asleep. I ignored the harsh bed and let darkness envelop me.

In the morning, light poured into my cold cell. I woke up feeling extremely well rested, which was odd. I noticed the light in my tiny abode. Also odd... I would usually be woken up by Cale’s morning prayers before the sunrise. The sunlight hadn’t yet hit the fourth indent in the concrete, so I had a little time to wake up before our cells opened up.

The sunlight eventually crawled past the fourth pock mark and I stood up and waited for the barred door to slide open. A second or two passed before I started wondering why the door hadn’t opened yet. I patiently waited a couple minutes. What the heck. Why hadn’t the guards unlocked the doors yet? The light on the lock still blinked red. I put my hands on the bars and tried to look around. No movement outside my cell, not even the sound of anybody walking. I bit my lip as I realized I hadn’t heard another sound since I woke up. Rook wasn’t clanging about in his cell, nobody’s feet were scuffling, no toilets being used. Everything about this morning felt off. I sat back down on the metal slab I called a bed. I could do nothing but wait.

Once the sun reached the end of my bed, I knew something was wrong. James, the main patrol officer, wasn’t strolling the walkway. No intercoms instructed us on our daily routine. It was well past breakfast time, and we still hadn’t been released from our cells. Would I be released at all today?

I glanced at my meals from yesterday in the corner. Hunger pulled at me and I devoured two of the three meals.

On the edge of my bed I waited, only the tick of the unseen clock comforting me. No meal bells rang. No voices called out in the grand space of the prison. No radio checks alerted us to someone else’s presence in the vast building. My ears constantly strained, trying to hear a sound that wasn’t my own. But none came. It was the longest day of my life.

I watched the sunlight slowly disappear from my ten by ten square. The cold from the outside set in. I stood at the entrance to my cell, debating whether or not to call out. 

“Good night…” I said in a shaky voice.

I closed my eyes. Please let someone respond. Somebody tell me to shut up. Please let there be some sense of acknowledgement. I don’t know how long I stood there. I glanced at the last meal I left in the corner. Picking it up, I ate the last bit of slop that remained in my cell. Climbing onto my slab, I stared at the ceiling. I did all that I knew how to – I focused on the seconds. *Tick. Tick. Tick.*

I eventually woke up to sun hitting my face. My stomach still felt awful, but I was more rested than I had been in a long time. I watched with concern as the sunlight made its way towards the fourth mark. Once it did, my eyes shifted towards the cell door. I waited. *Tick. Tick. Tick.* Eyes never leaving the cell bars, I listened for any semblance of human noise. *Tick. Tick. Tick.* Nothing. Worry crept along my back. My cell seemed smaller. No sound from my neighbors. Nothing indicated that they were here. Did they escape? Is that why McNally was empty, everybody searching for them? No, that would be crazy. 

Maybe somebody in charge of the guards pulled them all away for something. But surely they would leave at least one person behind. My brain couldn’t find a way to rationalize what was happening.

As my thoughts ran, my breathing quickened. I felt my body kick into fight-or-flight as I realized the door wasn’t going to open. I stood up and tried to force it. Gripping the bars, I strained to slide them open. I pushed and pulled until my muscles gave out. I tried slamming my body into the door, over and over again, until my shoulder couldn’t take any more. I hopelessly tried kicking the door open.

After an hour or so I relented to my tired body. I slumped to the floor, letting myself rest. My stomach felt like a knife was being pushed through it. Whatever sickness I got was still in my system, and I couldn’t get outside help. 

I took a couple deep breaths and tried to think of other ideas to escape… The lock. The lock was keeping me in here. If I couldn’t force my way open, I might be able to break the electronics. I stood up again and looked around for anything I could use to break it. Three paper bowls from the food I ate, my bed chained to the wall, and a metal toilet that was bolted to the ground. Hardly anything useful. I would have to try with my hands. I reached through my bars to the wall separating my and Rook’s cells. The cold concrete in between our doors was enough to hold the keycard scanner and keep us inside. The best angle I could get still bent my wrist at nearly 180 degrees. I could grip the scanner, but just barely. I tried lifting, twisting, bending, and pulling it. None of which worked. I even tried punching it, but because of the angle, only ended up knocking on it lightly. My body and eyes were growing tired.

I noticed the lack of light in the cell. The sun had started going down. A sigh exited my lungs and I hit my head against the bars.

For a second, I sat in the silence that haunted these past two days. *Tick. Tick. Tick.*

I rested in defeat, wondering what else I could have done. I decided it would be best for me to get some sleep and try again with the new day. My tired body climbed into bed and my eyes shut.

I woke the next day. It wasn’t light out. A surge of hope sprang through me, realizing I hadn’t slept in. I listened. *Tick. Tick. Tick*.

“Hey Rook!” I called out. *Tick. Tick. Tick.*

“Rook?” I probed in a quieter tone.

*Tick. Tick. Tick.*

Dammit.

I couldn’t hear Cale’s chants either. They weren’t there. I was still alone.

Tears started welling up in my eyes. I looked at the lock, then back at my bed. I crawled into bed and fell asleep again.

The next day went about the same, and the next, and then the next. I was starving. Worry and boredom occupied my brain for days. I needed water. I was going to starve. I resorted to going to the bathroom out the tiny window when I could. I couldn’t escape through there, it was much too small. Even if I tried, it was a 50 foot drop straight down. I could only watch as the empty world passed me by, not knowing my torment inside this prison.

As the days passed, I made half hearted attempts to open the door and break the lock. I was getting tired. I was getting weak. I only felt demoralized. Thirst set in. I didn’t realize it, but my mouth was suddenly very dry. How long had it been like that? As I moved my mouth, my lips cracked. How much water did I have left in my body?

It had been five days. Or was it six? The hours slipped through my grasp like sand. A vignette surrounded my eyesight. My skin stung from the snow drifting in.

Apparitions of Lindsey, Paul, and Rachael greeted me, walking through my bars. The spirits sat down, telling me about all I had missed. I cupped Paul’s rounded face, realizing he had grown up. My little boy had become the man of the house. Rachael ran up to me, her chestnut hair flowing behind her, and jumped into my arms. Her transparent body carried no weight. My dear Lindsey wore her favorite dress. I remembered the first time I saw her in it, orange flowers that I could never remember the name of, surrounded by a stunning red that complimented her flushed cheeks. They told me they loved me dearly, but that they had to leave.

I tried to cry with them, but only dry sobs came. When they left, my room turned cold again.

My metal slab was too chilling for me to lay on. I sat on the farthest corner from the window, avoiding the cold flakes and the bitter wind. 

I lay curled up in a ball, drifting in and out of sleep constantly. I could feel my body eating itself. My stomach gave me no comfort. My throat was dry. Every time I opened my eyes, the room was smaller than it was before. I felt as if it would consume me. The only thought that was going through my mind was ‘how did this happen?’ My shell of a body struggled to stay alive. *Tick. Tick. Tick.*

I was suddenly woken up from the black nothing that surrounded me. I could see the moon from the window. At first nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The cold of the wall pierced through my orange clothing. I was barely able to focus. Then I heard something. Deep inside the building I heard something. It was inconsistent with the clock ticks. It was slower. It sounded like a train chugging. After a second, a spark of hope shot through me, but should I let it? My brain could just be playing more tricks. Do I give myself false hope again? I almost gave up, deciding to ignore the fantasy that my brain conjured up. Then I looked up at the lock. The light was a solid, steady green.
