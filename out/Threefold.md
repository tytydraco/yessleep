I hadn’t thought about love in a long time. Not until that night.

I was lying in bed, my phone’s dim glow pressed against my chest, scrolling through old pictures. One stopped me cold: me, smiling on a hilltop, the sky behind me burning gold. I didn’t remember taking it. As I stared, the screen flickered. My face split; cleanly, suddenly; into three. Three versions of me, each smiling in a different direction. Then, just as fast, it snapped back to normal.

I sat up, unease crawling through me. The room was quiet except for the faint ticking of the wall clock. I shuffled to the bathroom, splashed cold water on my face. When I looked up, three reflections stared back from the mirror.

One was older, eyes heavy with sadness. Another was younger, somehow lighter, unburdened. The third was me; right now. My heart pounded as I stumbled back, squeezing my eyes shut.

When I opened them, it was just me again. One reflection. Mine.

Maybe it was exhaustion. I hadn’t been sleeping well.

Back in bed, the sky outside glowed with a pale moon. I turned toward the window, letting the cool night air brush my skin. But sleep wouldn’t come. Memories did.

First, **Rhea**. Ten years ago. Her laugh was like chimes, her fingers always cold. I loved her fiercely, too young to know how rare that kind of tenderness was. Then **Sophie**, eight years later. We met at a bookstore. She spoke so rarely, but when she did, her words hung in the air like poetry. And **Rebecca**, only two years ago. She was sunlight; wild, warm, impossible to hold onto.

I loved them all. equally and truly. But none of them lasted.
The ache of what could’ve been clawed at my chest.

**And that’s when the moon split.**

It didn’t crack or shatter; it just divided; into three perfect orbs. I bolted upright, the air felt thick and heavy. Then, without a sound, two versions of myself stepped out from either side of the bed. Not ghosts, not dreams; real. Solid. One looked toward the door, the other toward the window.

Then she walked in...**Rhea**. Her hair tied back, just like I remembered. She smiled.
At the same moment, I felt Sophie’s hand in mine, somewhere else. And Rebecca’s laugh echoed in my ears. It was like I was living those moments; being those other versions; all at once.

**Three of me. Three women. Three worlds.**

My heart pulled in three directions. I knew, without a doubt, I wasn’t imagining this. I had loved them all.

somewhere, I still did...

In other rooms, under other skies, those other versions of me lived on. One sat across from Rhea, our silence comfortable, easy. Another held Sophie’s hand on a bench, her voice soft as she read something I barely heard but completely felt.

We all looked up as the moons began to drift. No flash, no drama. Just movement. Three shapes easing back into one.

In my room, bathed in moonlight, I stood at the window.

I exhaled; not peace, exactly, but something close.

**The love was still there. Whole and Eternal.**
