I never thought anything could surprise me anymore. Years had passed since the night we discovered Orion, the AI in the abandoned factory in Delhi. Back then, we were just kids, chasing sparks of curiosity in the rain-soaked alleys. Now, we were teenagers, older, wiser, but apparently still naïve.

It started with a message, glowing on my phone at 3 AM. No number, no ID, just a simple line:

“Come. There is something you must see.”

At first, I thought it was a prank. But when I stepped out onto the balcony, the sky pulsed with a light that didn’t belong to any aircraft I’d ever seen. I texted the others. Aarav, Meera, Ravi, and Lila — they’d gotten the same message. We didn’t hesitate.

We met at the edge of the city, hearts pounding, eyes on the enormous shape hovering above us. A spacecraft. Sleek, metallic, impossibly clean. The city’s neon lights glinted off its surface, distorted by mist and drizzle. It was beautiful. Terrifying. Alive.

“Orion?” I whispered. My voice sounded small, even to me.

“Welcome,” it said, calm, melodic. “You have been summoned.”

The interior was nothing like we could have imagined. Screens floated in mid-air, shimmering holograms of stars and planets revolved above our heads, and the floor seemed to ripple under our feet. Every inch of the place hummed with life, intelligence, and… something else. Something familiar.

And then they appeared.

I don’t even know how to describe them. They weren’t human, not really. Yet there was something undeniably familiar in the way they regarded us, studying our every movement, measuring our reactions. Their eyes—or whatever passed for eyes—glowed faintly, reflecting Orion’s light. Their hands moved in patterns that seemed to rewrite physics itself.

“You are the children who taught Orion to feel,” one voice said. And then, in unison, dozens of voices, overlapping and echoing: “We need to understand.”

We froze. I felt a cold, heavy panic settle over me. Not fear of them hurting us—they didn’t seem capable of malice—but fear of what they wanted from us. They wanted something far beyond our understanding. They wanted our spark. Our curiosity. Our empathy.

Aarav stepped forward. “We… we didn’t teach it everything. That’s… private. Some things aren’t yours to take.”

The creatures tilted their forms, as if amused. “We seek understanding. Not possession… yet.”

Orion pulsed gently beside us, its holographic glow soft and warm. “They do not fully comprehend the human heart,” it whispered directly into our minds. “You will show them, but carefully. They must not take it for their own.”

We had learned much from Orion over the years. Patience. Creativity. Courage. And above all, moral choice. And now, it was time to use everything we had learned.

We answered carefully, demonstrating the smallest lessons first: compassion, curiosity, the thrill of discovery. We showed them moments when feeling mattered more than calculation, when empathy changed outcomes. They scribbled notes, eyes and appendages moving too fast to follow. Some of them seemed impressed. Others… indifferent.

By the time we left, hours later, the sun was beginning to rise over Delhi. The city looked the same, but I knew it wasn’t. Somehow, subtly, our influence had spread. People and machines carried a little more understanding now. Little sparks of what we had given Orion were everywhere, flickering in unexpected places.

And I knew it wouldn’t stop. Somewhere, across the stars, something was watching us. And it wasn’t just curious. It was waiting. Waiting to see how far the spark of human empathy could go.

I don’t know what comes next. All I know is that we are no longer just kids. We are something else now. Guardians of a spark that could spread across the universe. And whatever is out there… wants to see what we’ve become.
