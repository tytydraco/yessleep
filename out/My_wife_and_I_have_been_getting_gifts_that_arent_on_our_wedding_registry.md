We had been together for seven years when I finally gathered the courage to propose. It was everything I'd hoped for and then some. But things started to turn... odd after we had set the date for our small wedding and set up our registry with all the usual items, along with some "*nice-to-haves*". 



A cardboard package wrapped in a neat pink bow began to arrive every week in the run-up to our wedding. At first, they were non-threatening enough, even if still very strange. The first contained a single Polaroid photo of my wife and me taken years prior. We remembered when and where it had been taken immediately, but why exactly somebody had gone to the trouble of scrolling far down my Facebook wall to find it and send it to us, we couldn't explain. 



"*Well, that's fucking creepy.*", my wife retorted. 



"*Uhm, yeah...*" was all I managed to reply with before trailing off as I stared at the photo. 





We had been too busy to concern ourselves over it too much, but then the next package arrived. It was another photo of us. And this time, it was one I knew neither of us had shared with the outside world. No Facebook post. No text to Mom. Nothing. It wasn't even on my phone any more - but again, we both remembered taking it because neither of us could forget that sunset. It was the first time we said "*I love you*" to each other, against a backdrop of sky lathered in shades of orange and red as day gave way to night. How could either of us forget? 



Our lack of concern suddenly spiralled into me trying and failing to allay Bella's panic through an exterior of faux-confidence. I was rattled too, but two fearful people playing off each other wouldn't have gone down well. After talking things through, we decided to file a police report. It was a silly idea, even at the time, given the complete lack of evidence that whoever was sending these had malicious intentions, but getting ahead of the situation couldn't hurt. Bella needed *something* to put her mind at reluctant ease.



Three days after filing the report, the third package was left on our doorstep. By this point, we'd figured out the weekly pattern and decided to call into our respective workplaces to let them know we'd be running a little late that morning. But, as if in tune with our very thoughts themselves, the package was already waiting for us when we woke up. None of our attempts at catching the perpetrator worked in the future either - the package just appeared somewhere we hadn't been watching.



The bowtie had become a little tattered, a little less pink. Like it was losing the joy it was supposed to signify. A more recent photo lay inside this one. Dated maybe a few months ago. 



Except it wasn't a photo either of us had taken. 



We'd never been to the city in the background. 



There wasn't much Bella could do at this point except cry in a blend of confusion and fear each time a new package showed up as I shrouded my own unease to tend to her. Places we'd never been to, kisses we never shared, meals we'd never eaten. There were stacks of photos in each package past the third. All depicting a life we had never lived. 



I wanted to stop opening them, but I could never manage it. Bella insisted we find out what lay within each, as if she found some sense of comfort beyond the fear that the flashes of this other life struck within her. 



The final package arrived yesterday. The photos inside were what we had come to expect, except the last one, tucked away at the bottom and concealed under a vignette of supposedly happy moments. 



It was of Bella.  



Lying on our living room floor, arms and legs twisted in stomach-wrenching fashion. Sunlight crept through a corner of the window and bounced against a bloodied knife plunged into her chest. 



And off in the corner, far away enough to allow the horrifying central scene to remain the focus but visible enough to catch my gaze, was a figure. Somehow initially obscured by darkness enough to make it look like a blank canvas of a human before revealing itself over the course of a few seconds. 



It was me.



I turned to Bella, blood tinged with terror sloshing in my eardrums, and she was... gone. The space she had been standing in mere moments before was now vacant. Some part of me knew where she was, and I crept across the cold floor to the living room with all the technique of somebody who had forgotten how to walk before setting my eyes upon my worst fear. 



That same scene. Bella. Devoid of life. Of everything that made her, her. And as I stood in that corner, fulfilling the sick prophecy that had been bestowed upon me, the familiar click of a photo being taken from parts unknown broke the silence that had blanketed my surroundings. 



I thought better of my first instinct - calling the police again - given whatever lay in front of me was now self-incriminating. How do you convince people of the truth when all the evidence testifies against you? When Father Time himself testifies against you? 



I didn't - don't - even know what the truth is myself. 



All I do know is that I had nothing to do with whatever happened to my Bella.



And now, with a heart shattered through sorrow and grief and a mind brimming with primal fear, I'm condemned to a life on the run. 



A life of not knowing what. 



Not knowing why.
