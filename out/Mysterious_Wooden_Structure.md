I’ll say it right now, I am a horror fan. My friend and I have planned on making our own little found footage video for a while now, and we’ve recently started to actually work on the idea. What neither of us expected, however, was that we would end up filming something both unsettling and real.

Two weeks ago, my girlfriend Marie and I were hanging out at my apartment. It was a normal Friday night for us; we were eating pizza, watching some horror movies, and maybe smoking a little bit of weed too.

I have a passion for film; I’m not a film student or anything, but I really love the art form. Marie isn’t as interested in dissecting horror movies as I am, but she likes to watch them and she puts up with my yapping.

“I’m telling you, I would love to make something like this,” I rambled in her direction. “The good thing about found footage style movies is that you don’t really need much of a budget to make them.”

“And that’s perfect for you babe!” she said, looking up from her phone with a grin and a wink.

“Damn right,” I muttered. I took a bite of greasy pizza and thought for a few moments. “You know what? I think I’m gonna text Alex, we’ve talked about doing something like this before, I’ll see if I can get something started.” I threw my pizza down on my paper plate and whipped out my phone.

I asked him if he wanted to finally make a found footage video together, for real this time. Not even a minute later, I got a reply.

“Hell yeah dude, got any ideas?”

That’s always the hard part: coming up with an idea. I didn’t have one, but I had a plan of action.

“Not really, but why don’t we go location scouting next week? We can find some cool places to film, and maybe the ideas will come naturally to us.”

“Alright sure, sounds good to me bro. Just let me know when you’re free.”

And with that, our project was off to a humble beginning.

“Did he say anything?” Marie asked me.

“He’s in! I’m excited, this is gonna be great!” I was oozing enthusiasm.

“What’s your idea Mr. Movie guy?”

“I have no clue, but we’ll get there eventually!” I said confidently. She looked skeptical, but I was undeterred.

The next day, I tried to think about places that would be good to film at. I live in a mostly suburban area, and it was a bit harder than I thought it would be. But then I remembered: there was a small wooded area next to my old junior high school where my friends and I used to hang out.

It was a small forest divided into two sides by a small road. One side was populated by oak trees and had a few paths, which people often walked through during the day; the other side was filled mostly with pine trees and overgrown brush, which wasn’t as hospitable.

It was the perfect place. I figured we wouldn’t run into many people since we’d probably film during the night anyway.

Alex was busy that day, but I just couldn’t wait to check it out. For one, I wanted to go as soon as possible so I had more time to brainstorm, but I was also excited about seeing this place that I hadn’t been to in years.

I went during the daylight so I wouldn’t be wandering around in the woods alone at night, and looking back I’m thankful for that.

I parked in the small gravel parking space on the side of the road. The parking area connects to a large field next to the old school, which has now been closed for a few years.

I walked through the field toward the tree line at a leisurely pace. The breeze was cool and refreshing. I could hear birds whistling and grasshoppers chirping in the grass around me. Already my head was swirling with childhood memories; I used to go sledding down the hill on the other end of the field every winter.

Toward the corner of the field was the beginning of a path through the vegetation. When I got into the woods, the trees provided a cool shade that dropped the temperature by a few degrees. I continued to walk while observing my surroundings.

The dirt paths winded around through the forest in random patterns, intersecting at several points. There weren’t many sights to see, to be honest.

At one point I heard some kind of mechanical sound coming from behind me. It quickly grew louder as if something was charging toward me. I jumped and turned around only to see a teen boy on a bicycle zooming by me.

“Sorry!” he exclaimed, keeping his eyes forward as he rounded the corner ahead of me, fading behind the bushes.

I laughed to myself. I could remember being that same careless kid not that long ago.

My brain was working hard to try and make out some kind of inspirational details about my surroundings, but to no avail. All that I could see was dirt, trees, and bushes. At this point, mosquitos had found me and began to bite. I decided to go to the other side.

The path led to the small road that split the forest into two. Ahead of me I could see the tall pine trees that reached high into the sky. To the left of the tree line was a driveway that led to a warehouse of some kind.

I looked both ways before jogging across the street and then walked along the side of the road toward the driveway. I strolled down the driveway a short distance before the path into the woods revealed itself. There was a “No Trespassing” sign wrapped in vines that accompanied the path’s entrance, which I had long ago learned to ignore.

There was a reason this side of the woods was less popular. The path was much smaller, the thorny underbrush creeping and reaching inward from both sides. There were multiple logs and a few fallen trees that interrupted my way, which took minimal effort to climb over.

A short walk through the woods led to a small open clearing with only a few smaller trees in the middle. I took a quick look around and thought about how this location could be used. The mosquitos that followed me from the other side were growing in number. I took in the view around me and then headed back to where I came from.

That week I brainstormed for ideas. The winding paths through the oak side could easily lend themselves to confusion. Getting lost is always stressful to witness.

I knew the clearing on the other side could be a good spot to showcase a monster or something, as they would be easier to see. My only concern was if the stark contrast in appearance between the two sides would break immersion in the footage if I cut between them.

The next weekend, I prepared to return with Alex. I brought with me the shittiest camcorder I’ve ever owned, the reason being that it would add to the aesthetic of the film. I wanted to do some test filming with the infrared mode so I could see how it looked on camera.

We pulled into the gravel parking space as the sun was sitting behind the trees, making its way below the horizon.

“I know you’ve never been here before,” I said as I turned toward him, “so I’ll give you a little tour.”

“I’m excited now, this place looks creepy already!” Alex said with a growing smile. He seemed onboard from the start, but now I could see a light of wonder in his eyes.

We exited the car and made the same journey across the field. The shade the forest provided before was now an ominous dark void. I felt unease and excitement as we exited the open field into the dense woods.

We strolled through the paths with only our phone flashlights and my camera to illuminate the way. The display on the camera showed me the grainy black and white footage that I had hoped for. After some wandering around, we decided to cross over to the other side.

At this point it was completely dark outside. Both of us checked for incoming cars as we quickly crossed the street. Alex followed me as we passed the “No Trespassing” sign.

“You sure this place is okay to film?” Alex asked nervously.

“Don’t worry, I used to hang out over here all the time as a kid and nobody ever had a problem.”

The darkness was all consuming now. Our phone flashlights could only illuminate a short distance ahead of us. The sound of the chirping crickets comforted me, reminding me that we weren’t alone. We climbed over several obstacles in our way deeper into the woods, doing our best to avoid the thorns.

Just before we got to the clearing, I stopped in my tracks. Ahead of me, in the middle of the clearing, I could make out a very large shape. My heart started pounding and a chill ran up my spine. I focused my vision to make out what it was.

“Do you see that?” I said, my eyes still fixed ahead of me.

“That’s a fallen tree, I think?” he said uncertainly. The shape ahead of us was large and looming.

“All of that?” I asked. We sat in silence for a few moments. “Should we go… look at it real quick? Or no?”

Alex mumbled something to himself and trailed off.

“I gotta get closer so I can record it” I answered myself. I was spooked, but I felt a sense of adventure overcome me.

I took a few steps closer and Alex followed me. I could now tell it seemed to be a giant pile of logs and branches. It was about twice my height.

“What the fuck?” I said quietly.

“Holy shit, what is this?” Alex asked out loud. I didn’t have an answer.

We cautiously walked around the structure one slow step at a time.

“It’s not a fallen tree,” I said. “It looks like a giant… like… weird makeshift home? You know what I mean? Like Shrek’s swamp,” I said jokingly, but neither of us laughed. I couldn’t help but feel like we weren’t supposed to be here, like we were seeing something secret. I kept wondering where this came from. My mind was racing.

“Yeah…” Alex said.

“Wow, we actually found something weird,” I said as I continued slowly around the pile. “We’ll just go around this, and… walk a tiny bit more and then we’ll head back.”

When we got to the other side of the structure, I saw that it was not fully round. It now appeared to be a semicircle.

“Woah… dude,” I said, breathless. It was not a pile of logs and branches. It was a wall. The many branches and stripped logs were woven around the few trees in the center of the clearing. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I couldn’t think of what to say.

“Holy shit!” Alex said as he came close enough to see. “Someone made this.”

“How much time did it take to make this?”

“A fucking while, I can tell you that.” We continued to study what we saw before us for a few moments. I looked behind us into the darkness of the woods.

“Think we should head back now?” I said quickly.

“I think so.”

We hurried back around the wall toward the trail.

“By the way, this wasn’t here before if I didn’t make that obvious” I told him. We traveled at a faster pace than before, our clothes snagging on thorns as we went.

We didn’t say much else until we got to the car. As I drove him home, we tried to rationalize what we saw. We just couldn’t imagine what its purpose could be or how it was built so fast. There was a silver lining to this creepy event, however: I had it on video.

That night I reviewed the footage. It was definitely creepy. Something that caught my attention was that as we were leaving, it seemed every sound in the forest stopped. The flies quit their buzzing and the crickets stopped chirping. It’s possible it was just an audio glitch, I still don’t know.

That was yesterday. I still don’t know what to think of this structure. Please tell me if you know what this could be, it would make me feel a lot better. I think we might go check it out during the day again, just to get a better look at it. I’m not deterred from using this place as a filming location! In fact, this thing could be a blessing in disguise. It definitely scared us, so why not use it? I’ll make an update if we find out what it is, so stay tuned.
