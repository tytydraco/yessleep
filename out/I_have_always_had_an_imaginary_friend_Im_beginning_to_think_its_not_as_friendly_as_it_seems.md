My name is Mike, My whole life I have had an imaginary friend. At first my family thought it was cute but the older I got the weirder they thought he was and I was. So at the age of 11 I started to hide him and act like he didn't exist.

&#x200B;

He had always been friendly and fun, I didn't really have any friends growing up because all I needed to keep me happy was him. We would swing on the swing set together, play tag together, play video games together.

&#x200B;

I discovered from an early age that no one could see him, I never really thought why. He had been there all my life so he was just like a brother to me. 

&#x200B;

You're probably wondering what he looks like. The simple answer is nothing, he is just a black humanoid figure. What he sounds like? A low monotone voice even from a young age. His name was Friend, I had always called him that and still do, that is his name. When I wasn't talking to him he would just go into the corner of the room we were in and watch.

&#x200B;

I am 32 now, he is still with me. Everything changed last year. I was going well in life, I had 3 kids, a wife, we were in a comfortable financial situation, and me and Friend still had frequent conversations, when no one was around of course. I had never brought up Friend with my family as I knew they would have the same reaction as everyone else "You're crazy" So I just continued on with life, me being the only one that knows about Friend. Of course my parents knew but they thought he was just a imaginary friend which I forgot about at 11.

&#x200B;

Last year, I was sleeping and awoke in a cold sweat. I looked around to see my Wife wasn't there, I got up and calmy walked to the bathroom, she wasn't there. Now more panicked I searched every single room and couldn't find her. Desperate I asked Friend "Friend did you see where she went?" Friend chuckled and blurted out "Balcony" I immediately ran back upstairs and opened the balcony door and there she was. Standing on the balcony rail.

&#x200B;

 "Honey what are you doing!" She slowly looked back at me and smiled, a unusual grin that looked like it spread to her ears. Then I also noticed that her eyes were bloodshot red. Before I could ask any questions, she jumped. The last thing I heard before releasing a blood curling scream was the sound of her body hitting the ground.

I sit straight up in my bed, not doing anything, and just staring into nothing. "I'm sorry for your loss" Friend interrupted the silence. I smile slightly "Thank you Friend you've always been there for me" Friend crept out of the corner and sat down on the chair opposite my bed. "It was kinda funny how she hit the ground though. Splat!" I stare at Friend shocked before letting my anger take control. 

&#x200B;

"What the fuck did you just say" I got up and grabbed Friend by the throat dragging him off his chair and onto the wall "Fucking say it again! I dare you" Friend smiled, although he can't smile with his blank face, I could still tell he was smiling. "Why the fuck are you smiling!" I punched him square in the head, my hand almost disappearing in his blank black face. My fist almost recoiled off him like a trampoline. Then he laughed, the most sadistic laugh i've ever heard. I stepped back, in fear, anger, and anguish, and fell onto my bed. Almost falling asleep as soon as I hit the bed

I sit at the funeral with my 3 lovely daughters, they are all crying ferociously, I am not. The only thing I can do is stare into nothing and think about why she did this, why were her eyes like that, what was with her grin, how am I going to support this family on my own? My intensive thoughts were interrupted by sick, psychotic laughs. I slowly turn my head into the top left corner of the room to see Friend sadistically laughing again, I hadn't talked to Friend since the last incident. I had to resist the urge to get up and beat the shit out of him. I didn't want to start a scene.

&#x200B;

Things had finally started to be normal again, my Daughters were nearly back to their old self, I was nearly back to my old self, and we were managing better than I thought we would. I had also stopped worrying, and talking to Friend, sure he was still there. But he was completely silent, of course I never tried to start a conversation with him after what happened.

&#x200B;

Later that  night I was peacefully sleeping when I was awoken by a voice, Friend's voice. "Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby" He sat in the corner of the room, I couldn't see him but I could clearly hear him. He was saying my oldest daughters name. Ruby is my bright, well behaved, 12 year old daughter. "What do you mean! Stop saying my Daughter's name!" He stopped and just laughed his usual sadistic laugh.

&#x200B;

I thought about it for a few seconds and shot up from my Bed and ran to Ruby's room. I barged open the door, she wasn't in her bed. I stood there, my mind running wild thinking about all the things that could of happened. I snapped out of it and ran to the Balcony opening the door.

&#x200B;

 She wasn't there, thank god. But my Daughter was still missing. I got back into the house looking down the stairs. Then I could hear it, running water. At first I thought it was just the tap and was relieved. She must of just gone to the bathroom, but then I noticed it was too loud and heavy to be a tap. 

&#x200B;

It could only be the bath, I walked down the stairs curious to why she would be taking a bath in the middle of the night. I arrived to the door and knocked. "You alright in there honey? No answer "Why are you taking a bath in the middle of the night?" No answer. Now I was really worried, it was not like her to ignore me at all "Hey if you don't answer me I'm going to come in!" I raised my tone a bit getting annoyed. 

&#x200B;

"Fine!" I slowly opened the door and saw Ruby. She was in the Bath, underwater, still as can be. "Oh shit!" I immediately thought the worst and pulled her out the water, I looked for a pulse but there was none. I desperately tried to do CPR screaming at my other Daughters to call the Ambulance. The Ambulance arrived 20 minutes later, it was too late by the time they got there. She was dead.

I sat at my Daughter's Funeral, once again, still staring into nothing, as a few tears roll down my cheek. My 2 remaining Daughters hugging me and crying furiously. Sick, Heinous, Sinister laughs erupted from the top left corner of the room. Of course I knew exactly who it was.

&#x200B;

 This time I couldn't handle it. I shot up, everyone stared at me as I walked towards the top left corner of the room. The pastor stopped delivering his speech on Ruby and stared at me aswell. I went up to the corner of the room getting closer and closer to Friend's evil laughter and I punched him square in the face. Then I kicked him in the groin, then I punched him again. I kept going, tears in my eyes and everyone in the room scared for my wellbeing. 

&#x200B;

Of course my punches, kicks, scratches, all just kept getting recoiled back like a trampoline. I don't know how long I went on, but the next thing I remember is waking up in a Hospital room. I immediately looked in the left corner of the room and saw Friend. It felt like he was giving me that usual wide evil grin. I tried to get up so I could continue beating the living daylights out of him but I couldn't. Everything was sour. I paid attention to my body, I was in a hospital gown, and my Hands were wrapped in bandages.

&#x200B;

"You're awake Mike?" I jumped and looked to the right and saw a pretty Nurse smiling at me. "How are you feeling?" "Why am I in here?" She looked down, a bit disappointed I didn't answer her. 

&#x200B;

"Mike, you- you broke multiple holes into the wall at your Daughter's funeral. After a few minutes of you continuously punching and kicking holes into the wall. People tried to stop you but to no avail. The Police were called and had no option but to knock you out for your own safety. Your Knuckles were bleeding intensely and you had a intense concussion. You've been in the hospital for 2 days now." I stared at her, trying to take in this information. "Where are my Daughter's?" The Nurse smiled "Don't worry, they're at your parents house" I let out a breath that I had been holding in for a long time in relief.

1 week later

I was released from the Hospital, pretty much fully healed. I saw my Daughter's for the first time since the funeral. They did many tests on me at the Hospital to make sure I'm not insane. Somehow I passed but I had to go to the Doctor's weekly for a check up.

&#x200B;

We're back at home, but we are all very quiet, and I am very paranoid. Now I am scared of Friends presence. I always feel on edge. He is evil, and I think my wife and Daughters death are all related to him. He is staring at me, grinning as I type this.

&#x200B;

I am scared for my family, even my remaining 2 Daughter's can tell something is wrong. I don't know what to do. What can I do?
