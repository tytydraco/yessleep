I don’t know why I’m writing this. No one’s going to believe me. But something happened last month on my drive through North Carolina, something that’s made sleep impossible and life unbearable.

I was heading to Asheville to see my sister. The drive from Charlotte was long, and my beard had gotten out of control from weeks of couch-surfing and living out of my car. I figured a clean shave would help me feel a little more human.

The GPS rerouted me through backroads thanks to construction. I was tired, low on gas, and running on fumes—mentally and literally—when I rolled into a tiny town that didn’t even seem to exist on my map.

Mayberry.

It looked like a postcard from 1961. White picket fences. A drugstore with soda fountains. A diner with neon signs that buzzed just a little too loud. There were no people. Just stillness. No cars, no voices. Just the heavy silence of a town forgotten by time.

Then I saw it.

Floyd’s Barber Shop.

The sign was chipped but still bright. The window showed a striped pole slowly turning, although there was no wind. I don’t know why I went in. I think some part of me was just craving normal. A quick shave. A little conversation. A chance to pretend I wasn’t falling apart.

The bell on the door clanged.

A man inside looked up from an old magazine. He wore a white smock and had perfect silver hair, combed just so. His eyes locked on mine. Too long. Too still.

“Come on in,” he said, with a warmness that felt acted.

He watched me walk in, eyes scanning my face like he was reading a menu.

“Floyd,” he said, offering a hand. His skin was cold and papery. “You got quite the hairy chin there, son.”

I laughed, trying to ease the tension I suddenly felt. “Yeah, figured I’d get cleaned up a little.”

He gestured to the barber chair. “Sit down. Don’t be afraid.”

The leather stuck to my arms as I sat. The shop smelled like talcum powder and mildew. He pulled a lever and the chair tilted back. Then he draped a hot towel over my shoulders and face. Steam rose. My vision blurred. The heat felt too hot. I tried to sit up—but the chair wouldn’t move.

Then I felt it.

The rope.

It snaked around my wrists and ankles. Tight. Fast. A second figure behind me pulled it into a knot.

“Barney, get the back,” Floyd said, almost cheerfully.

“What the f—” I started, but the towel pressed down harder.

I tried to fight. Scream. But a heavy pressure held me down.

“Shhh,” Floyd whispered. “This part’s important.”

Then I felt it. A sharp edge grazing my neck. Not shaving—scraping. Blood ran down my throat.

“Steamed towel opens the pores. Makes the sacrifice clean,” he murmured.

The towel slipped, and I could see—barely.

There were others in the room now. Their faces blurred. Wrong. Like half-finished wax models melting under heat.

“Opie, Aunt Bee,” Floyd said like he was announcing cast members. “The guest is ready.”

I thrashed. Someone grabbed my chin. I felt breath on my face. Then the sickening sound of a zipper.

Something warm and wet pressed against my lips.

My stomach lurched. I screamed.

“I was shaved,” Floyd sang softly. “I was shaved. I was shaved.”

They repeated it like a mantra. The whole room joined in.

“I was shamed,” Aunt Bee whispered as she brought down a straight razor and opened a line across my chest.

“I was shamed,” said the boy—Opie—as he reached into my mouth with fingers far too long, trying to pull out my tongue.

I passed out.

I woke up in a field miles away. My body was covered in cuts. Symbols. My beard was gone. My lips were bleeding. My wrists bruised.

The police told me I must’ve been mugged or had a breakdown. They found no evidence of any Floyd’s Barber Shop in the area. No town called Mayberry. Nothing on satellite images. My phone was wiped. My GPS history erased.

But every night since, I hear that voice in my dreams.

“Come on in…”

And every morning, no matter how clean-shaven I go to sleep—I wake up with a full beard.

And the words “I WAS SHAVED” are written in the mirror.
