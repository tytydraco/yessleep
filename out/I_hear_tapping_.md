I hear tapping 
Coming up the stairs, as if someone was creeping up slowly, trying to go unnoticed. I look over at my cat, confused. I think he hears it too. It’s hard to tell, with cats. 

It’s not my neighbor, Mary, who wakes up at dawn to feed the stray cats. She’s a lovely woman, but clumsy, and I usually hear her bumbling around in her apartment, clattering dishes together, before her squeaky door swings open, and she calls and coos to the stray kittens that curl around her legs. Mary does not care if she is noticed, and, honestly, I barely notice her anymore. It’s part of the neighborhood morning routine, like the garbage trucks on Tuesday, or the house next door full of smokers and their subtle bonfire of cigarettes. Really, Mary and her cats are quite tame; they all are, once you’re a part of the routine and swing, and I’m an early riser, regardless, and my mornings are as aligned with my neighbors’ as one could be without being a nosy Parker. It’s called being considerate, like waiting for 12B’s kids to toddle off to preschool before running the vacuum. 

The tapping resumes, and I knock into my coffee, started out of my lull. 

It’s not the crows, which Mary feeds as well, even though I beg her not to encourage the greedy bastards. She leaves piles of (roasted, unsalted) peanuts in the road, and the crows and occasional mourning dove carry them to my roof and crack them open. It’s an annoying sound, but easily identifiable, and, again, part of Mary’s routine. It’s not this sound. This sound is off schedule. It’s not-

Wait. 

The stray cats outside started screaming. My cat rushes to the door. I rush to the peephole. What could make them sound like that?

Mary heard it too. Hears it too, they’re still screaming, and I hear her jamming her feet in shoes and squealing open those rusty hinges. I can’t see what’s happening-

Now she’s screaming. 

I can’t see what’s happening from my vantage point but I duck down anyways, sliding down the door, unconsciously pressing it shut with my back, holding my hand over my mouth to muffle my breathing. 

The screaming has all stopped but the tapping is back. 

Chills crawl up my spine as the sound of (fingers?) (spider legs?) whatever is moving outside clicks toward  my door, tentatively tapping, trying the doorknob, testing the lock, tapping and tapping, with only the thin door between us. I’m sure it can hear my heart knocking in my chest. I can’t tell when I’ve last taken a breath. The sound outside doesn’t stop and I start shaking and my hands tap together, my teeth chatter 

What the fuck will I do if the door shatters 

And the tapping outside turns into a rapid clatter that thank God is moving away as something larger than a house cat rummages through my flower pots. 

And then it stops. No footsteps moving away, no door-shattering, no more screaming. I’m crying, but silently, into my hands which are still clutched over my face, and I can hear dripping outside in the same rhythm as my tears fall.
