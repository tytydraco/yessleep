Right, so I just wanna start by saying my friend and I have been urban exploring for years. It's a mutual interest we share that's kept us close since high school.

I mean, it's not the only thing we do–we also go to bars, play video games, stuff like that. In our adventures, we've seen some really incredible things.

Abandoned castles, amusement parks, creepy tunnels, hospitals, ghost towns, etc. It's a lot of fun, and I recommend it to anyone with caution.

Definitely be very careful if you decide to pursue something like this. You may find yourself stumbling into a restricted area, so don't get caught.

There's also an off-chance you could bump into a crazy squatter, which is why I always carry a gun on me. Better to have it and not need it, I say.

Along with that, we always take a sturdy backpack with a flashlight, headlamp, snacks, water, first-aid kit, camera, portable charger, knife, binoculars, compass, and dust mask, just to name a few items. It's also important to dress for the occasion–durable, protective, and comfortable.

We actually stumbled on this location by chance a few days ago. We didn't even set out to do urban exploring that day–just driving around the winding roads deep into the mountains, planning to go camping.

That's when we saw it.

Way off in the distance–behind a heavily wooded slope of the mountain–there was a tall, pointed black structure peaking out from the trees. As you can understand, this piqued our interest immediately, so we turned on the road towards that direction.

It took a while to get over there; we kept having to guess which turn was the right one as we got closer. Eventually, the asphalt roads ended, and we were left with bumpy, uneven dirt roads.

He has a tricked-out Jeep Cherokee designed for off-roading, so this wasn't a huge issue. We grinded along the course dirt, going up and down until eventually, the ground leveled out for a bit.

The dirt roads were now gone, and all that was left was grassy terrain. We noticed something strange soon after; the terrain started going drastically downwards.

This was weird because the structure was really high up when we saw it off in the distance. How was it possible that we were going downhill?

We were sure this was the right direction, but it wasn't so obvious now. Still, we pressed on. After what felt like twenty more minutes of off-roading, I could see through the space between the tree tops for a few seconds.

I saw it again, and looking ahead, we could barely see it hiding behind all the trees. Must've been a quarter mile away at this point.

So we progressed further, winding around all the trees until we finally got to it. When we pulled up, there was a clearing encircling it.

A monumental black monolith stretching high into the sky, and next to it was a church. We pulled up cautiously, as we weren't sure if this area was inhabited.

After scoping out the area for a moment, we came to the conclusion that this area looked long abandoned. So, he turned his keys and we got out to look around.

This spire must've been more than a hundred feet high; it was insane. Surrounding it on all sides were freshly dug plots that looked like graves.

Guess this area hasn't been abandoned for long. I started to regret our decision to come over here–especially since the closer I got to the monolith, the more my head began to throb in pain.

Four sides made up this formation, and I could barely see the top of it. Upon closer inspection, I noticed strange symbols carved all throughout.

I have no idea what they meant, and neither did my buddy. The moment we decided that we should definitely leave, a surge of intense headaches slammed into us like the front of a pickup truck.

We both fell to our knees, clutching our heads in agonizing pain. An ear-piercing blare erupted that wouldn't let up, and continued until I passed out.

When I woke up, I was somehow in my bed again with no idea how I got there. I pulled my phone out to call my friend, but got voicemail every time.

I got out of bed and went to the door. To my shock, it wasn't my same old living room when I passed through.

I was outside that church again, with the tall black monolith towering over me.
