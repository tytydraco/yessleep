I was eighteen the night my parents tried to sell me to the dark. That sounds dramatic, I know. At the time it just looked like a celebration. There were white tablecloths, and little silver stands with place cards, people in clothes that cost more than your car, and waiters drifting in and out with trays of food I could not pronounce. All of it for me. For Jenna, the golden girl.

I had just come from the state track championship, my spikes still in the bag in the front hall. I won that trophy. I had also graduated at the top of my class. There was an acceptance letter from an Ivy League school in a folder upstairs, along with a swimming scholarship. On paper, my life looked perfect, and I believed it was all mine. My hard work, my muscles, my brains.

So, when my dad raised his glass that night and said my name in that booming voice of his, I smiled like I meant it, and tried not to think about how cold the big dining room always felt once the guests had gone.

And they were gone early that night. By nine the dishes were gone, the lights turned down, and it was just the three of us at the long table, napkins crumpled in front of us, the centerpiece flowers leaning like they were tired. My dad tapped his fork against his glass and cleared his throat.

“Jenna, how do you think we’ve risen to this lifestyle?” He gestured grandly, the way he always did when he talked about money. His gesture included the chandeliers, the paintings, the whole big echoey house. I saw our reflection in the window behind him. Three people who looked like a family from a catalog.

"I don’t know, hard work and good connections.”

My mom made a little sound, almost a laugh but not quite. She looked down at her plate, tracing the rim with one finger.

She said, “there certainly has been some of that, but how much actual “hard work” have you seen your father devote to anything?” Her voice had an edge I did not recognize. My father looked up, trying to make eye contact with her, lips pressed flat against his teeth.

She went on, still talking to her plate. “The fact is, he doesn’t have to.”

I waited for the punchline but Mom does not joke.

My fork suddenly seemed too loud against the china. Dad stared straight ahead for a moment, then turned his head toward me like it hurt to do it.

“Jenna", he said, looking at me like he was staring into my soul, "your great grandfather made a bargain with a…dealer, where we would get good luck and fortune for a negligible price for a lifetime. And that includes our children up to the time they are 18 and leave the house. Before they leave, the child, you, must also make a choice. Will you accept the bargain and take the path to great fortune, or decline it, and lose that link to continued wealth for you and the whole family.”

If he had told me he was actually a lizard in a rubber suit it would have felt more believable.

I looked from him to my mom. She still would not meet my eyes. My heart did that thing it does right before the starter gun goes off. It is not fear, not exactly. It is a feeling like the world has narrowed to a single thin line, and if you slip off, you are gone.

“What do we bring to the table to get this bargain?” I asked.

“It will all be explained by the Dealer,” said dad. He checked his watch like he was waiting for a conference call.

My mom finally looked up, but not at me. She stared past my shoulder toward the hall.

“He is waiting for you in the study now” she said. There was awe in her voice, and dread.

I pushed back from the table so fast my chair scraped across the floor. No one scolded me for the noise. That scared me more than anything they had said so far.

I walked down the hallway, the soles of my sandals whispering over the polished wood. Every family photo seemed to watch me. My fifth grade picture where I had new braces and too big glasses. My eighth grade swim team shot, my shoulders already broad, the coach standing behind me with his hand on my back like he had discovered gold.

At the end of the hall were the double doors to the study, dark wood. I put my hand on one of the brass handles and hesitated.

I could have walked out the front door, I guess. Called a friend, called a cab, called anyone. But that was not how this worked. In our house you did what Dad said, and you did it well.

I opened the doors.

I had expected a shadow in the corner, something out of a horror movie. What I saw instead was a mild looking man sitting behind the desk in the full light of the room. He wore a cardigan and jeans, dark hair combed neatly, maybe late twenties. There was a ceramic mug on the coaster beside him, steam curling up from it. He looked like a grad student on break.

He looked up, smiled, and said, “I’m sure your parents told you the little secret to their success, and what’s at stake if you go rogue, so should we get on with it then?”

“Wait, what, who are you, what do I have to do…” I heard my voice shaking and hated it.

The Dealer cut me off. The smile slipped from his face like it had never been there. His voice turned sharp.

“I don’t have the time or inclination to allow this to drag on. If you agree with the deal, things go on as they have been. You will excel as you have up until now. Life will be easy; you will have success in every endeavor. Come here and sign on this line and you live a dream life. If you refuse, you won’t, simple as that. You will have an unlucky life. Everything your parents built will come crashing down. I don’t know how someone in your position could even hesitate. Stop making this take so long and sign.”

The air in the room thickened. It felt like someone had turned off the oxygen. The man on the chair was not mild anymore. He was the same height, the same body, but his posture changed. It signaled that he could be on me faster than I could reach the door. His hair looked a little messier, his eyes a little brighter. Older, somehow. Hungrier.

“I’m waiting” he said.

My legs refused to work, like they knew something I did not. I stood there, breathing like I had just finished the four hundred meter dash.

“What are you doing, get up there and sign” my mother hissed.

But she was not in the room. I realized the study doors were not quite closed and her face was framed between them, one eye and half her mouth, both twisted with fury. She looked like a more terrifying version of herself.

That look finally shoved me forward.

Mom had spent my whole life asking for more. More medals, more points, more A grades. I felt like I never satisfied her. I needed to try.

I walked up to the desk.

The Dealer stood up. He was taller than I thought. He smelled of expensive cologne, the kind some of the men at the country club wore, but there was a hint of something rotten under it. His skin was perfect; eyes a weird gold color that made me think of old coins. Once my eyes met his it was almost impossible to look away.

On the desk was a long legal looking document with the typical yellow “sign here” tab stuck near the bottom. Beside it lay a heavy black and red fountain pen and a small glass dish.

“Give me your hand” the Dealer said.

His voice had gone flat, businesslike.

“Why?” I asked, though I already knew.

The pieces clicked together in my mind, memory of dark old stories my grandmother used to tell when she had too much wine.

“Don’t be a baby, let’s get this done, yes, it has to be signed in blood, big deal,” he said.

I should have run. I should have screamed. I should have done a hundred things besides what I did, which was to freeze again, sweat profusely, with a dry mouth.

The Dealer did not wait. He grabbed my right hand, his hands like iron, and in one smooth practiced motion he stabbed my index finger, hard, with the fountain pen.

The pain was sharp and immediate. Blood welled up and he turned my hand so it flowed into the glass dish. The moment the blood touched the glass it turned black and bubbled slightly. Not dark red, not maroon. Black, like oil boiling in slow motion.

Something roared in my ears. I could barely hear him when he dipped the pen into the dish, then pushed it into my hand.

“Just sign here and you and your parents will be happy for the rest of your life, do it now.”

I knew he was telling the truth. That was the worst part. I could feel the promise in his voice. Easy days, effortless wins, the same invisible hands that had been carrying me all along.

“Hurry up and sign” he shouted.

The roar in my ears was building to the level of a hurricane.

“Just do it.”

My arm rose on its own, like someone was pulling it up by the elbow. The pen felt heavy in my fingers, the nib already wet. Somewhere under the noise a tiny part of me thought about the word “lifetime”. Then I thought about my future kids, faces I could not see yet, and a cold little voice inside said, “What about the price”.

With a scream I did the only thing I could think of. Using every bit of strength I had gained from every sprint, every weight lifted, every lap swum, I used that power to bring the pen down as hard as I could on the back of his hand that was holding the edge of the contract.

The pen sank in like it was going into soft clay.

The Dealer made a sound that was not human. The lights flickered. The air seemed to tear. His blood erupted from the wound and hit my face. It was hot and smelled like something from the bottom of a swamp. His eyes went wide and then wider, the gold burning into something so bright I had to look away.

I heard footsteps behind me, my mother screaming, my father shouting something I did not catch.

The room spun, then stretched, then snapped back.

When I opened my eyes, I was on the floor.

The dealer was gone. The only sign he had been there was a light scorch mark on the carpet behind the desk.

My finger was still bleeding.

From the hall I heard my mother sob, “What have you done, what have you done,” over and over. My father said nothing at all.

People think curses are fireworks. Big, loud, obvious. My curse turned out to be more like a slow leak in a tire.

Things did not explode. There was no lightning bolt, no swarm of insects, no demon leaping out of the ceiling vent. The Dealer vanished, that was all. One second he was there, making that awful sound, and the next there was empty air and the smell of burned matches.

My parents did not comfort me.

“You stupid girl,” my mother whispered. “Do you have any idea what you have done to us?”

I wanted to tell her I had done it for my own future kids, for a life that was mine, for a choice that was not made with a pen full of someone else's blood. But I just held my bleeding finger against my dress and stared at the mark on the carpet where the Dealer had been.

Nothing looked any different.

The next morning my dad’s car would not start. It was a small thing, but the way he looked at me when he came back into the kitchen made me go cold inside.

Dad’s big investment went sideways a month later. Some tech company that had looked like a sure bet evaporated overnight, taking most of his liquid cash with it. I heard him yelling about it from my room.

The future narrowed.

For me, no Olympic trials, no glossy magazine covers. No corporate headhunters courting me at fancy dinners. Just a stack of applications and a quiet little job at a not for profit corporation that helped kids in rough neighborhoods find safe places to be after school.

The pay was not great. The work was hard. I came home tired in a way I had not known before, bone deep, with a head full of other people's trouble. But when I lie down at night, I felt something I had never felt in that big cold house growing up.

I felt like the day had been mine.

My parents did not attend my college graduation. By then Dad was busy with lawyers. The embezzlement charges had taken shape, then solidified, then locked around his ankles. His talent for getting away with things had run out. Turned out when luck leaks out of your life, auditors can see everything you thought you had buried.

Mom had moved to a small townhouse across town after the divorce. She worked part time at a boutique and told anyone who would listen that her husband had ruined her. She did not mention the deal her grandfather had made, or the one I refused.

When I visited, which was not often, she looked at my clothes, my hair, my tired face, and sighed. “You could have had so much more,” she said once, standing in the narrow kitchen making coffee that came from a can instead of using a gleaming machine the size of a microwave.

But the good things came on their own too. They felt different. They felt earned.

One of those good things was my daughter. She was smart, but it did not come as easily. She had to study. She had to practice. She did not coast through races on legs that never seemed to tire. She tried out for track and made the team, but she was always in the middle of the pack, never at the front.

Her eighteenth birthday came and went. We had a cake, a pile of modest presents, some handmade cards from the kids in my program who adored her from the days she volunteered there. No men in cardigans appeared in the living room.

Maybe the world was fair after all.

A month after her birthday, and two weeks before leaving for college, Lily came in from the porch holding a small cardboard box. The mail had already arrived that day. But this box must have been dropped off later, maybe by a courier. There was no return address, just her name written in black ink on the top.

Inside, was a fountain pen. Heavy, black and red. The sight of it made me feel the terrible stab into my finger, the way my blood had turned to thick black ink when it touched the glass.

There was a note folded beside it.

“Mom?” I heard Lily say. “You okay? You look like you just saw a ghost.”

The paper was the same cream color as the contract I had refused to sign. The writing on it was neat and precise. Not my father's. Not my mother's. Not anyone I knew.

The note said only,

“See you soon.”
