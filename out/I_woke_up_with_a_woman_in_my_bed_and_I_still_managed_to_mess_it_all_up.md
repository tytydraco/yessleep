I woke up staring into the face of a woman I did not know resting quietly besides me. Her soft features and softer eyelashes fluttered and she slowly opened her eyes after a moment of my staring to return my gaze, and she smiled sweetly back. I asked her who she is, and she told me her name was Ann.

  
Ann got up and began her day, as I began mine. She was swift and graceful somehow, a dancer off stage who cannot let up the natural refinement of her motions. She dressed before I could process the movements and let herself out of my room and I was left without her; her absence already noticeable and cloying. I followed along to make sure I was not out of her shadow for longer than I could bare.  
She was already making breakfast by the time I brushed my teeth and washed my face. I was hesitant to change my clothes, after all that was not part of my routine, but I figured if I must make a good impression on Ann I need to be more presentable for her. My house was a disaster, but if I could at least make myself acceptable, maybe she could look past that.

  
She placed fried eggs and toast in front of me, a mug of tea, and a kiss on the forehead before I was even able to pull my seat out at the kitchen table. I muttered a quiet “thank you” before digging into the meal presented. She sat across from me, a plate and mug of her own, and quietly scrolled through her phone. From this position, fully awake, I was forced to study her. The delicate curve of her jawline, her long bony fingers, her pink cheeks.

  
Ann pretended not to notice me staring. Instead, she allowed the indulgence and I was grateful for her generosity. I needed to study her more than I realized, and as my heart pounded, I realize that I could not stare at her much longer or I feared I would not be able to breathe. Our meals finished, Ann stood up to collect our plates and I realized I had been a very bad host. This was my house after all, and although I never got around to washing the current mounting pile of dishes, I realized that if Ann is to be here, she could not do them for me. There is an exchange of service and gratitude that must happen if I wanted to keep Ann in my house. I realized this as Ann was reaching for my plate, and in an awkward panic I raised my hands up and pushed my chair back, making an exclamation of “I’ll take care of it!” My chair knocked into the hand of hers which already held her plate, and I watched out of the corner of my eye as it slipped from her hand and began to fall towards the floor. I panicked once more, but then something peculiar happened. Ann caught it, but not with dexterity or hasty movements. Ann stretched. Her arm elongated to meet the falling plate, catching it inches from the ground. The arm recoiled back into her, she smileed down at me. “Don’t worry about it,” she said, “Please, take it easy right now. It’s my day to treat you, remember?” I did not remember, but I nodded.

  
There was a dread in my stomach as I looked upon Ann, standing over the sink, washing not only our dishes but the molding pile of dishes already inhabiting the sink and counters. I weighed my options. I already knew Ann was not real. She could not be real, as I have no memory of her before waking up that morning, not even addressing her strange ability. She was not overtly dangerous, but I know that’s never meant much in previous situations. She could have more in store that she was not showing me, I reasoned. But looking at the slope of her neck and the curve of her legs, I decided that perhaps I’ll keep my guard down. I wouldn’t want to mess this one up, and if she’s was going to ruin me, I’d let her.  


&#x200B;

  
Ann was able to modify herself at will; that is the conclusion I came to. She never needed to ask me for a single favor as she undertook the duty of cleaning, and in the short time we spent apart together I am fully aware there is no way she could have dusted the corners of the rooms and the grate near the ceiling unless she stretched herself again. She didn’t seem bothered by any of the cleaning products and despite my protests I watched her saturate a rag in bleach, holding it with her bare hand, and rub it across the kitchen’s surfaces. She seemed unbothered by any of this and did it selflessly, having to tell me multiple times to stop trying to get in her way of completing the task at hand. I stopped trying to defend the pile of unread mail she was attempting to throw out and finally let her be.

  
Regardless, I will say it was more than just that: her apparent aptitude at cleaning and resistance to harsh chemicals. I begin to realize that every time I looked at her, she was a different, somehow more radiant version of her previous incarnation. It started subtly. I thought maybe her hair looked a little shorter, perhaps a bit shinier, but I chalked it up to just not being very observant. It was at the dinner table in front of the meal she’d prepared for us that I notice she had freckles, and suddenly dimples appeared when she smiled widely at an unfunny quip I’ve made. I reached down to grab the dish of green beans and when I looked up her eyes were suddenly a soft amber. At night in bed together I wrapped my arms around her and pressed my face into the wavy chestnut hair she did not have that morning, and I fell asleep.

  
I suppose I should have been more alarmed by this, this phantasmagoric girlfriend that was given to me suddenly. Please don’t misunderstand me: I was unnerved. Every time I looked up into eyes I didn’t remember, or a stranger walked into the room every hair stood up in a natural response of fear and recognition of wrongness. But as soon as I allowed myself a few moments to gaze upon her radiance I felt myself calm down. I understood that this was still my Ann, and despite the changes she underwent, she was still lovely, and she was still mine.

&#x200B;

  
There was something more though. As I watched her over the next few days, I realized that behind the disquiet, behind the desire for her, there is something unexpected. It came to me suddenly when I walked into the kitchen and saw her standing at the counter in front of me, and I realized she was several inches taller than she previously was. I was struck with the sudden awareness that there was an additional emotion that I could not place when I first looked upon Ann. Behind the former two emotions, the prey-like terror and intense longing she instilled, I realized that I was jealous. I envied that she can change at will. That whenever she wanted to or needed to, she could grow or shrink as much as she wanted and make herself the desired size. I was jealous that she could shorten her hair as much as she wanted only to turn around and have it brush against her back. I was angry that she could have such beautiful wrists and slender hands only to change everything about them in order to fit the situation. I was furious that she could change, and that I could not. I could not change and morph myself like she could. I am static, and she was ever evolving. We are not the same, and yet when she looked at me, I couldn’t even tell how she felt about that fact. I think she looked at me with adoration and kindness, but what if she could change that at will too? She’s not real. Were her supposed affections for me genuine, or just another thing she’d changed about her appearance?  
My adoration was replaced with hunger.

  
I watched Ann more intently now. There was no reason to hide my blatancy, not now that I thought I knew what I need. When she left the room, I followed. When she began to occupy herself in a task, I joined in. I tried to eat in time with her, lifting the spoon of hot soup to my lips in an attempt at synchronicity. Ann would be in the bathroom, pretending to be a real human being, and I stood in front of it, knocking when I thought it was taking a bit longer than an unreal person should be taking. I couldn’t bear to be apart from her. I needed to be synced up with her as closely as possible. If I acted close enough to how she acted, maybe I can gain this ability. Maybe I could become what she was.  
This was starting to weigh on her, although I can’t imagine why. She was given to me, and she’s not real, so why would this start to affect her? She started slipping up with her expressions around me, the way she acted and moved and glanced. The mask of adoration and kindness seemed to be crumbling, although she was trying to keep it up. I caught her clenching her jaw when I’d force myself into her space at the kitchen counter to help cut vegetables, or a creasing of her brow when she’d try to sit and read on the couch when I’d crawl upon her, as if I was hoping to be absorbed into her. I knew that this is what I must do, though. There was an unsubtle slight recoil when I reach for her hand in bed and pulled it towards me. I was patient, however. I know that once we become one together it will be what I’ve always wanted for myself, and I know she is the one that can give this to me. The change that she possessed would be as natural to me as it was to her.  

&#x200B;

  
“I can’t continue with this,” Ann told me, sitting at the dining room table over dinner. I looked at her puzzled, pasta hanging off the fork.

  
“What do you mean?” I asked, putting my utensil down.

  
“You… need to let me breathe. The way things are right now, I can’t. I’m starting to feel like I can’t have space to myself. Like, I’m not my own person. I know we’re living together, but that doesn’t mean I can’t still feel entitled to some free time and space to myself,” she started to ramble, her hair becoming curlier to hide her eyes from my gaze. There was a knot in my throat.

  
“I don’t understand, I love being with you,” I lied, “Don’t you want to be with me?”

  
There was a pregnant silence between us, her fork scraping against her plate as she pushed her noodles around.

  
“I… do, but the way you’ve been acting lately, it’s exhausting honestly. I just want you to please, just let me have time to myself throughout the day. I want to go to the bathroom without opening the door to find you sitting across from it, staring at me intently. It’s weird.”

  
I didn’t know what to say to this of course, as she’s right. My behavior had been extremely weird, very off-putting. But why did it matter? This was my house she was living in. She wasn’t real. She was made for me.

  
“I’m sorry,” I told her, lowering my gaze and dropping my voice, “I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable. I’m just, well, really grateful to have you here. I love you, and I love being around you. I feel so nervous when you’re not there. I’ll stop that though, it’s not your burden to bear. I’m not your burden.”

  
Her face softened, thankfully. A fish drawn to my lure, moth to a bulb. She pushed her chair back to stand up, beginning to cross over to my side of the table. I gripped the butter knife resting next to my plate. She was next to me then, reaching her long, long arms around my shoulders, burying her face in my neck.

  
She ran her fingers through my hair, beginning to lavish me with what she was supposed to. That this is all worthwhile, I’m wonderful and she didn’t realize how I had felt and why I was acting the way I was. I don’t think I was hearing her properly anymore, though. I was ruminating, realizing what had to be done now. She wouldn’t accept the methods I’ve been using to combine us into one entity. She did not want to be a single entity, formed together. She was selfish, and wanted her abilities for herself. She made it clear that my actions were unacceptable, and I did not think I’d be able to get away with them from now on that the line has been made clear.

  
I was going to have to try an alternative method, reverse what I had been attempting. I was going to have to subsume her into me.

  
The knife in my hand plunged into her throat, close to where it rested near my own. She screamed, unsurprisingly, as I yanked it out to plunge it in again. She threw herself away from me, elongating her limbs to gain distance. Throwing myself upon her, I knocked her to the ground, stabbing the knife into the front of her neck. And again, and again, repeatedly. I registered that there was a pain upon my thighs, scratches where she was between my legs, keeping her pinned beneath me. She reached up and attempted to grab the knife, ending up with it stuck in the middle of her palm. This made her scream louder, especially when it was yanked out and brought back down forcefully into her chest. I attempted to pull the knife out but could not; my hands were slippery. I didn’t realize how red they were until then. I slammed my fist into the top of the knife lodged into her chest, and leapt up to the counter, attempting to grab a new weapon.

  
A large chief’s knife was my tool of choice to continue, and she crawled into the corner of the kitchen, begging me to stop, asking my why, but I was upon her again. She fought back better this time than when I initially took her by surprise, and it was a bigger struggle than previously to shove this knife into her throat as well. I didn’t want her to be dead, but I needed her to lose more blood. I needed her to stop fighting and struggling. I needed what I had to do to her to be easier.

  
We were sitting in the puddle that spread beneath us. She was rapidly changing before my eyes, changing everything about her, her last defense mechanism. Her last-ditch attempt to connect to me. Her last attempt to appeal to me visually, to get me to stop. I reached for her arm, and began. I cut a small slice of the top of her forearm, flat and thin. I didn’t know how hard this would be for either of us. I popped it quickly in my mouth, not bothering to chew before swallowing. My stomach churned, and I resisted the urge and kept everything down. Her eyes were wide, and when I looked at her directly again, no matter what color they were, I recognized the revulsion.

  
She struggled sluggishly as I began to cut bigger and bigger pieces off of her, slowly consuming each chunk of flesh. Her fingers and toes were difficult to get the knife all the way through, but I managed. They were easier going down than expected, despite being remarkably crunchy. At that point thankfully she stopped fighting, her breaths were shallow and rapid and she changed slower before my eyes. By the time I was beginning to remove pieces of her face I couldn’t feel her breaths upon my hands anymore, the knife slicing across her lips and nose. Her eyes settled on a soft hazel green by the time they were removed and placed hastily in my mouth, as I was in a rush to devour her as quickly as I possibly could. I wonder still if those were her real eyes, or simply the last cycle before she left me.  
It was a struggle once I got the easier pieces off of her, that being most of the soft tissues. I needed to break her down, and I couldn’t stand to lose a single piece of her. I wouldn’t be getting it right unless I fully consume her. I took the largest cleaver I could find in my kitchen and commenced chopping her into more manageable pieces. The limbs weren’t the most difficult once I began to aim for the joints where she was loose and bendable. From there I gnawed on her skin and flesh and sinew. I couldn’t describe the taste. That wasn’t the purpose of this; it wasn’t for hunger or my enjoyment. This was for us. It was for me.

  
Exposing the thorax and breaking open her ribcage brought me the closest I think I have ever been to a person. My hands caressed her viscera, before I dug in to complete my task. I did take the most pleasure in consuming her heart, the large symbolic muscle in my hands. I wonder if it had beat at all, and if that was part of the illusion of her reality. I wonder if it had only beat for me.  
I spent hours chewing her up until I was left with nothing but bones that I could not consume no matter how hard I chewed. In cracking them I was able to scrap out and chew on the marrow inside, but the bones themselves refused to break up small enough to be comfortably swallowed. I tried my best, finding a mallet in the kitchen drawer to break them down into more manageable pieces. I could feel them tear at my esophagus as they went down, but I knew it’d be worth it in the end, and so I continued.

  
At last, I was left with a pile of discarded clothes and congealed piles of blood. I took a mop and bucket out the closet and filled the bucket half full with hot water before beginning to sop up the mess on the floor. I wiped the mop head over the puddles of blood, scrubbing at the cracked, dried stains to get them up. I returned the mop head back to the warm water, squeezed out her blood, and returned it to the mess on the floor. Once all the blood was up off the floor, I knelt down and took the bucket in my hands. I raised it to my mouth and tilted, slowly beginning to swallow the diluted red liquid I’d managed to save. Once it was all gone, I refilled the bucket in the sink, and tried and to consume the last traces of her blood. I threw the bucket down, and took my place upon the floor where she once laid. I chewed and sucked on the mop head, hoping to salvage the last remainder of her. I was desperate to consume all of her.

  
I do not know what I was expecting, I suppose, when I reached this stage, but the first plan of action after completion that came to me was to test out my new powers. I got up again, abandoning the mop head sopping with my saliva on the floor. I raced to the bathroom, staring into the mirror. It was time to see how my work had paid off.

  
I was standing in front of the mirror, staring deeply at my reflection. Did I just… think of changing? She seemed to be able to do it on command without speaking, I’m sure she was thinking about those changes. Something simple, I say. I’m decide that I’m going to remove a pimple that was staring back at me. I focused on it, thinking neutral thoughts of unblemished skin in that specific area. Neutral wasn’t working, and the red bump still remained. Negative or positive thoughts, maybe? I thought undesirably about my zit, and when that doesn’t work, I began to think optimistic thoughts of how much nicer my skin would look without it there.

  
Still, nothing changed.

  
I began to become frantic; I’d always wanted curly hair, please let me have curly hair, a smaller nose, maybe a light dusting of freckles, just to see how it would look and if it’s unfortunate I can remove them as easily as she did. Longer eyelashes, perhaps? There was no change, beyond my increasingly distressed and wide eyes. I moaned into the sink and began to heave with despair and disgust. There was no possibility of me gaining her ability, was there? Why didn’t I just ask her about it? I was so determined to keep the upper hand I didn’t even consider asking her, instead I coveted her for her gift and tried to steal it from her. I didn’t just steal it from her, I devoured her for it. My hand was upon my bloated stomach as I began to hyperventilate, my mind dizzy and my throat burning with bile. 

  
What have I done? Ann… I’ve ruined what we had. I ruined what was given to me, I couldn’t just have something nice, could I? When will I learn?
