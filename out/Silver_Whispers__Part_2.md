Hello again. This is Sophie, I have updates for those who read my previous  [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17hj757/silver_whispes_part_1/).

&#x200B;

I avoided leaving the house in the previous days, especially at night. The experience in the park made me aware of certain things, things I started to feel. Small things, like waking up in the middle of the night and feeling something lurking outside my window. It happened several times. Of course, my daughter, as an infant, can wake up in the middle of the night, but I am used to that. Once, I woke up to the sound of a knocking at the window, my baby started crying. I looked outside, but nothing was visible.

&#x200B;

Fortunately, I have some friends who know a thing or two. One of them is Ruxandra (not her real name). She is an independent journalist who has a Youtube channel on political, social and economical issues, but who is also interested in the paranormal and is on the watch on some things and shared some local Facebook posts. Some things have happened those days that have not reached mainstream media. Ruxandra fears a cover up, although she can not see why for now. There are two cases I want to bring up.

&#x200B;

The first one was told by the teen daughter of a Norwegian diplomat. It happened a few hours after what me and Michael experienced that evening. I managed to translate something using Google Translate into English, I hope it is ok.

Last night I suffered the most frightful thing ever. Or one the most frightful, at least. My father wanted to go to a fundraiser at a restaurant on Herăstrău river. I was not feeling very well, I would have skipped it altogether, but there were diplomats from several countries, with their families and, besides, I would have met some of my friends and this October season being especially warm, an evening on the banks of the Herăstrău lake could have been relaxing. The lake sits in the middle of a huge park, almost like an urban forest, there are several restaurants.

&#x200B;

(Sophie note: the Herăstrău lake is one of the lakes created through damming the Colentina River, like the Tei lake and it has a park around it. It is upstream of Tei, and Herăstrău lake and Herastrău park are much larger than their Tei counterparts. All those parks could be considered, in a way, like one very big park, although fragmented, around those lakes.)

&#x200B;

The first part of the night was quite uneventful, it was very much how I expected to be. After a few hours, I felt like getting some fresh air on the lake bank. I went to an area with poor illumination, in order to feel less distracted. It felt like a Norwegian August night, warm, but much drier. I missed the ocean a lot, but this lake can do, for a time. There were still many people in the park, not being troubled by the wind that swirled a bit, from time to time. Ripples formed in the lake. I waited for a few minutes, looking at the reflection of the lamp post light in the water. Small white lights seemed to dance on the water. It took me a few minutes to notice something bizarre on them, looking behind to see the lampposts being turned off, yet the lights were still visible. Also, they flickered even when the wind was not present, and that intrigued me.

&#x200B;

I went closer to the water, looking at them. I took some brushwood and tried to touch the water with it, in order to avoid getting dirty. Doing so, the lights got even stronger and started to move closer to me. There were definitely no reflections, they were pretty big, the biggest ones being about one inch tall. Some started to move away from the water and I began to freak out a bit and got up. They moved alongside me, and some got really close and I could see now small white candles, with a grey flame, floating in the air, coming towards me. As they got closer, I started feeling a chill and a weird noise coming from them. It sounded somewhat like voices, but I could not understand any clear words.

&#x200B;

They attempted to surround me, this made me even more scared. I wanted to get towards the restaurant, but they charged at me. Their touch was cold and painful, this made me scream, as they attacked me. I started running, but they would not let me go. One tried to get into my eye, one managed to touch my scalp and that was very nasty. But I knew I could run fast, so I tried, although my high heels made running on the grass harder. I did not have time to drop my shoes, to run faster, so I had to run like this. They followed me and, eventually, I tripped and fell to the ground.

&#x200B;

The fall was not too painful, but those things were above me. I screamed. Then someone or something grabbed me from the back and a dark, gloved hand covered my mouth and a punch brought me down. It started to struggle on the ground, as both the assailant and those things charged at me. Each touch of them caused me to have some sort of seizures, each leaving a small wound. A strong feeling of death was around me, like being in a place of death, worse than a morgue or a graveyard. I struggled enough to uncover the mouth and shouted in English: ”Help! Help me, please!”, then the attacker covered it again. At this point, it felt very much like death had come to claim my soul from the land of the living. I got a blow to the back of my head, knocking me unconscious.

&#x200B;

This would have been the end, most likely, if two men were not close by and ran to me. They saw me on the ground, and the attacker, covered all in black, including the face, nothing visible, and the Candles around me. They said it felt very cold and a dread came over them but they managed to keep calm and charge the attacker, who fled on a different alley and the Candles towards the lake, disappearing in the dark. I am now in a hospital and, frankly, I am thankful for being alive.

There were other testimonies from other people who got glimpses of weird lights near lakes or rivers that night, but nothing too serious. Indeed, a weird mood of death came on me even in broad daylight, and the small wounds gave me a strange pain. There is a voice in the back of my head telling me to be indoors before sunset and never leave my home before sunrise. Mom came out late yesterday night, and that made me feel afraid for her, during the evening. Of course, you may say this is just trauma, but…

&#x200B;

Yesterday night, there were other small incidents and a big one, this being the second I want to bring up. From the small ones, near the Străulești lake, two primary school kids, besides seeing the lights in the water, heard a bone chilling wolf-like howl, but much stronger, nearby.

&#x200B;

And for the most serious one: two university students came near the bank of the Dâmbovița river, the main river that flows across the city, near the Grozăvești student dorm. One of them got drunk in a local student club and his friend brought him out for a chill on the river bank. Just upstream of the river, a huge dam was built to create a big lake, almost an entire neighborhood was brought down for it. In recent years, a huge bridge was built over the river and the lake, the result of it being that the section of the river, after the dam of the river bank, became a thicket, some remains of civilization there, some abandoned lamp posts being the most obvious. Here it is:

Me (Șerban) and Bogdan reached the river, I think it was after 1 am already. Bogdan went out in the bushes, it was very much his style of crap, I knew it too well. I called for him to come back, but he refused to. Being really drunk, I was worried about something happening to him, so I followed him there. As I called him out in the dark, he went fast into a group of pine trees. I heard a small thud sound and tried to get there, although it was really dark.

&#x200B;

Something pinched me in the back of my neck, it felt like a hornet, but cold. I looked back and it was a bloody candle, floating in the air, surrounded by some sort of halo. I was not drunk or high, those who know me personally know I do not do drugs at all and I have witnesses I was not drunk at all last night. As I looked back, there were more things like that behind me, blocking the way out of the thicket. Then, another thud from the dark and, as I remembered Bogdan, I ran towards there. I managed to see him, on the ground, with some of those things around him. Also there was a person, dressed in all black, including gloves and a beanie, dragging him deeper.

&#x200B;

”Hey, you, leave him alone!” I shouted and charged towards that person. They were quite thin, I have had much more muscle, I know I could easily overpower them. Bogdan was not just drunk, but had a pretty frail constitution, no much muscle mass, unlike me, it made sense that the attacker managed to bring him down fast. I pushed them to the ground pretty fast, gave them a few punches, but those things came on me like a swarm of angry wasps, stinging me (I can not find a better term.).

&#x200B;

Each ”sting” was more painful than a hornet sting, it felt both like burning and freezing, if this makes any sense. I started pushing them away, trying to avoid new ”stings”. They brought some sort of weird white halo of coldness and fear and they were producing some mumbled sounds that seemed to express anger. Something inside me felt a weird, unexplainable fear of them, as I am surely not that type of guy to be afraid of petty things.

&#x200B;

I knew I had to avoid touching them as much as possible yet, they were quite small, perhaps I could finish them up. I think I looked like some sort of angry chimp, like you see on National Geographic, moving my arms against them, trying to keep them away. In the end, being close to the branches of a pine tree, I used one loose wood to hit them. As I noticed one was close to the trunk of a pine tree, I pushed it to the wood using my elbow. Wearing a parka, I thought that perhaps it would not ”sting” me. I indeed crushed it to the tree trunk, but it hurt like a blow torch was burning my arm. The fiber of the parka entered my flesh, the pain being beyond what I can describe.

&#x200B;

This made them even angrier and went all towards me even more so. It was like they were mumbling now curses in a language I could not understand. I could have tried to take them down, I might have succeeded, but the price felt too high at this point, I could be dead or crippled beyond healing. So I started running away from the thicket as fast as I could. I got several ”stings”, two of them close to my eyes, but I was able to escape downstream Dâmbovița. The pain in my arm was so great, each step I took, it felt like it was all over  my body, like the venom from a snake or spider making its way to all the extremities. At the same time, it seems I was not able to move my arm anymore. I ran until I was beyond the fence of the amusement park, and it felt huge, like a mile away, although there was much less.

&#x200B;

When I finally decided to stop and look back, feeling no more recent ”stings”, I noticed I was not followed. A coldness was felt in my entire body, irradiating from my elbow.

&#x200B;

As I finally reached people, I asked for help, not just for me, but also for Bogdan. When the area was finally checked out, Bogdan was nowhere to be found, neither the assailant. Those things were not seen, although there were signs of struggle and the bark of one pine tree was crushed on one side, with traces of an unknown, paraffin-like substance.

&#x200B;

I am now in the hospital, the wound can not be explained, it looks like some sort of weird burning. I am scheduled to have surgery later today. Already doctors spoke of bringing a psychiatrist, they did tests on me. My arm is numb and painful, I hope I shall not lose it.

Ruxandra hopes she will be able to get to this guy, to talk to him. It seems me and Michael escaped pretty easily, if we compare our experience with this one. I hope to be able to keep you updated, if anything happens. I am curious, has anybody experienced anything like this?
