 

My great-grandfather was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the ripe old age of one hundred five. At one hundred six, it was safe to say that his story was about to come to a close. I was grief-stricken, even before his passing. I had always had a special relationship with the man. He was like a third parent to me at times. I wasn’t ready to lose him, but nothing could prepare me for the stories he’d recount before I did. 

“Pops, is there anything I can get for you before I go? Just say the word and it’s yours.”

Pappy smirked slyly.

“Anything? I’ll take a pack of Marlboro reds, if you’ll be so kind.”

We all chuckled.

“Very funny. That’s what landed you here in the first place. Sondra and I are running home for a quick shower and a bite to eat. We’ll be back before you know it,” my grandfather said as he patted me on the back.

Pappy shot them a thumbs up, and they shuffled out the door. I scooted closer to the hospital bed. He flashed me an adoring grin. 

“So, Pappy. I have a project for one of my college courses, and I remember you mentioning that you fought in World War Two. I was hoping that you might be able to fill me in on what the war was *actually* like instead of what I see on TV. Feel free to say no.”

I watched as the perpetual shimmer in his eyes was snuffed out. His face sank, and he averted his gaze to his bed sheets. A pang of guilt bludgeoned my chest like a sledgehammer. I hadn’t expected that reaction. My great-grandfather glanced up at me, tears threatening to spill down his cheeks. 

“Pappy, I’m sorry I didn’t mean to-”

“No. It’s high time I admit to someone what really happened all those years ago. I’ve been a coward, bottling this up for so long. I’ll tell you, Cam. But only to get this off my chest. Be forewarned, the stories I’m going to share with you will completely change your perspective of me. If you don’t want that, now is the time to say so.”

I remained silent, weighing his words. What did he mean by that? I idolized that man. Whatever he had to say wouldn’t sway my standpoint on that. Right?

“I understand.”

“Okay. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

I nodded. 

“Do you remember when I told you that I immigrated to the United States from Poland once the fighting was over?”

I shook my head in acknowledgement.

“That was a lie. I served the German army as an SS officer in the Third Reich. Do you understand what that means?”

“So, you were a… Nazi?”

“Yes. I have many regrets in my life, but this is the greatest.”

My jaw fell to the floor. His thoughts must have been jumbled. Surely he wasn’t thinking straight. My head spun as I struggled to comprehend his words. 

“B-but you can’t be. You’re one of the most genuine, caring people I’ve ever met.”

“Lift up the blanket over my left foot. Tell me what you see.”

I reluctantly obeyed his command, peeking under the covers. A faded symbol was tattooed on the top of his foot. 

“A swastika.”

“That’s right. A swastika. The infamous emblem of Hitler’s tyranny. Do you believe me now?”

“Yes,” I squeaked, timidly returning to my seat.

He erupted into a coughing fit, his chest rattling violently, before he laboriously regained his composure. 

“Cameron, I don’t have much time left. Are you *sure* you want me to continue?”

I mulled it over briefly. My curiosity won out. I had to know.

“Yes. I’m sure.”

Pappy sighed.

“Alright. When I was twenty-one, I joined the German militia. I graduated from college a couple years into the war. Due to that and my unrelenting ambition, I quickly rose through the ranks. Toward the end of the war, I was stationed at Auschwitz. You have heard of Auschwitz, yes?”

I gulped, a dry lump trundling down my throat. 

“I have.”

“Then you know of the atrocities committed there. I am no innocent man, Cameron. I wish I could tell you that I tried to put a stop to it. Or at least that I did not participate. But alas, I cannot.”

A single tear trickled down his cheek. 

“Pappy, you don’t have to go on. I know this is hard to-”

“No. After all these years, all these horrible silent years, I need to confess. I want a clear conscience before I pass to the other side.”

I solemnly nodded.

“Once I arrived at the camp, I was assigned to the gas chambers. When those that the government deemed impure were shipped in, I was in charge of sending them to their fate. I would order them to strip down to nothing and force them into those cramped deathtraps. We told them they were going to take a shower. That they’d be just fine once they were rinsed off. Lies. All of it. I am personally responsible for the deaths of thousands of men, women, and children. So many children.”

He broke down and wept, fat sloppy tears staining his light blue hospital gown. I waited patiently for him to resume. 

“They didn’t deserve to die. Just as I don’t deserve to live. Worse were those who survived the death chambers. The ones considered eligible to work. We shaved their heads, beat them, tortured them. We broke their spirits. And for what? Because of their religious beliefs? Who were we to play god? But at that moment, we were brainwashed. Sheep led to believe that what we were doing was right. Our actions were justified in the eyes of Germany, so it couldn’t be wrong. At least, that’s how we viewed it.”

He was rocked by another intense coughing fit. I was glad for it. I needed a break. I began to dread every word that slipped from his mouth. He locked eyes with me, years of shameful remorse surfacing behind his pupils.

“The things I did are unforgivable. I brutally maimed guiltless men for the pleasure of it. If a man spoke out of line, I would cut out his tongue. If he shot me a dirty glance, I would gouge his eyes out. God forbid, if he tried to fight. If he clawed at me, I would tear his fingernails off one by one and shove them down his throat. If he bit me, I would pluck out each of his teeth and force him to swallow every last one. And if he punched me, I would break his fingers before amputating his entire arm. I remember one resilient old man who wouldn't give up. He hit me until I took his arms. Then he kicked me until I took his legs. He bit me and scowled at me and shouted obscenities. Once there was nothing left to take, he spat on me. So what did I do? I threw him to the dogs. I watched as those vile beasts ripped him to shreds, stripping every last morsel of flesh from his body. And do you know what the worst part was?

I hesitantly shook my head.

“I enjoyed it. I took pleasure in the suffering of others. I relished showing up to work every day, armed with the knowledge that I was going to inflict agonizing irreparable disfigurement upon some poor undeserving man. All the pain, the torment, the anguish. I reveled in it. For that, I will pay with my soul. I can’t change the past. I’ve worked every day attempting in vain to clean my slate. But it’s marked in blood. No matter how much I scrub, it’ll never wash away. I’m sorry for laying all this on you. You shouldn’t have to bear this burden, but after all this time, I needed to tell someone. And there’s no one I feel more comfortable confiding in than you.”

I sat there, shell-shocked. My heart thumped in my ears and my head buzzed like a thousand invisible hornets swarmed within. My role model was a monster. I couldn’t look him in the eyes anymore. Not after discovering what he’d done. I shakily stood.

“I-I need a minute.”

My great-grandfather gazed up at me, defeated and overcome with sorrow. 

“I understand. Cameron, I love you.”

I stared past him into the curtain-shrouded window. I could only bring myself to nod as I walked out the door. 

My great-grandfather passed away nine hours later. After revealing his sins, there was nothing holding him back from leaving this world. As the rest of my family grieves, I just feel… numb. I’m still having trouble processing it all. I’m conflicted. I want so badly to tell someone, anyone. But I can’t do that to my family. I don’t want to tarnish their memories with him. So, I’m relaying this here in a fruitless attempt to gain a little mental clarity. In the end, I just hope I can put this behind me, and that I’ll never be on the receiving end of such a gruesome confession ever again.
