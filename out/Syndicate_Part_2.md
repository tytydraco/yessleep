Part 1: [Syndicate \[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1edphhz/syndicate_part_1/)

The next morning felt like a bad hangover. I was sore all over, and the hot pins and needles of anxiety flooded my entire body. When I looked around, the scene was unfamiliar and nauseating.

Pulling myself upright, I tried to look around to peer out of any window. Begrudgingly, I remembered they had been blacked out by paint. There was no telling what time it was or how long I had been here. My mind was still far from understanding the situation I was in. 

I looked around the room, but the single bulb that swung slowly above me barely illuminated half of it. The warm light lit up enough to cast shadows of vague objects scattered around me. The room looked like a garage-turned-storage room attached to someone’s house. The door to the right of me must have been the door I came in through because the door to the left gave the appearance of an interior door that led into a home. I wondered if the people who lived here had done this and for what reason.

I managed to get myself to my hands and knees then make my way to my feet. I was still shaky, and I felt a wave of confusion, but I had to stand upright and try to walk. While I shuffled along the concrete, I noticed that not only was I *not* chained, but I still had the clothes I had been wearing at the time of my kidnapping. Oddly enough, everything I had in my pockets hadn’t been touched either. Instinctively I reached for my phone in the pocket of my shorts. I breathed a sigh of relief when I felt that it was still there and intact.

“It won’t work.” I heard a male voice say. I looked up and saw a figure sit up from a pile of blankets. 

I didn’t respond. I simply looked down at my phone that showed no signal. I looked back up at the shadowy figure and back down at my phone a few times until I finally remembered how to speak. 

“Why?” I asked meekly.

The man stood up. I half expected a giant figure of a man to arise from the sheets, but what I saw was a figure not much taller than myself, stretching and trying to get his bearings as he walked cautiously over to me.

“Well, they take all that later, but until then they jam our phones with some sort of device. I’m not sure. Do you have kids? It’s the same thing they use at schools to keep kids from playing on their phones at school.” He spoke with the tone of someone who had been over this time and time again. He wasn’t cold or rude, just very matter of fact. Part of me thought that the calmness was more frightening than anything. I hadn’t yet begun to wonder how long he had been here. Thinking back, I never asked him either.

When he found his way to the light, I noticed that he was a bit younger than me: maybe early to mid-twenties. He was a good-looking man, African American, slight build, and kind eyes that carried a look of defeat.

“I’m Noah.” He spoke. It wasn’t so much of a greeting as much as it was a statement.

“Crystal.” I replied. 

Noah slowly put out his hand, and I gave him my phone. I watched as he placed it on a table nearest to the door with the blacked-out windows. 

“Why?” I said, again, as if that was the only word I knew. 

“They’ll take it and won’t need to look through your pockets. They don’t really care about more than phones, I guess. I don’t know. I figured you wouldn’t want to be touched again.”

I didn’t move. He didn’t seem to be scared, but I could sense his hopelessness. I wanted to ask what was happening but the words were stuck in my throat, choking me. Noah didn’t wait for me to ask him questions. He walked back to his nest of blankets and sat down, his back pressed against the wall. He looked forward aimlessly like he was returning to a dream while awake. 

I stared at him for a moment then looked around. I saw the woman who had cared for me earlier. She was still sleeping in her own bundle of blankets; I felt a pain of sadness for her. I still wonder what happened to her after she left. I try not to think about them anymore now... even though I know that their kindness kept me holding on to my humanity as long as it did. 

I felt the urge to walk around, and I caught myself roaming aimlessly in a daze. A sharp stab in the middle of my forehead snapped me back to my harsh reality. 

“Fuck...” I trailed off holding my head. Noah stepped slightly closer but kept his distance. 

“Are you ok?”

I thought for a moment and realized what I was feeling was withdrawal pains. 

“I don’t have my medication.” I said, my voice shaking, holding in my anxiety. “I am trying not to panic.” 

Noah didn’t say anything initially. He knew that there was nothing anyone could do for me. He continued speaking, possibly to ease my mind. 

“What are you on?” 

I started panicking and admitted, “A lot. I have bipolar disorder… along with other things.” I had never plainly admitted something so personal. “I take an antidepressant, a mood stabilizer, adhd medication, and antianxiety medication when I need it.” 

“That’s a lot.” Noah said plainly. “Well, maybe you can sleep off the withdrawals.” He tossed me a bottle of water. I watched it roll to me, and I stared at the label cautiously looking for any clues to nearby civilization. 

“It’s just water. Don’t read too much into it. No one here is in any shape to help you if you start spiraling.” 

I tried not to be hurt by his words, but the situation, the fear, and the lack of medication keeping my mood swings and anxiety at bay started making my body feel hot. I could feel anxiety rearing its ugly head and boiling me alive. I started to panic, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I started thinking about the times I had panic attacks in front of my family; my children would grab my ice pack from the freezer, bring me a soft blanket, and one of them would sit with me while the others would put on a happy movie to bring me back to reality. However, this time I didn’t want to be in reality. The more it set in the worse my anxiety became. 

I felt the breathless panic wash over me and my body alternated from boiling hot to freezing cold so quickly my head began to spin. I fell back onto the pile of blankets and clawed at the floor, grasping anything I could around me. I found empty water bottles strewn around, and I grabbed them, throwing them through darkness aimlessly.  Terror swelled inside of me, and I continued to claw and writhe on the floor unable to stop it.

I was on my hands and knees on the ground screaming, arching my back like a scared cat. I could feel my back spasm and my stomach turn as I hollered unintelligible screams into the darkness. I couldn’t find the calm in the storm of dread I was in. I had never fallen this deep to my panic and now there was nothing peaceful to hold onto. After what felt like eternity, I muttered the words, “Help me” and fell to my side. My eyelids were heavy from tears, and the pain in my chest shot through to my back.

I used to fall into delusions thinking I had died and wondered if death is living in a permanent standstill of time. Watching everyone be still around you while you try to get their attention to no avail. At that moment, I began to feel that I had died and made it to the waiting room of Hell, painfully waiting for my turn. 

They say at the moment of death, your life flashes before your eyes. Even though I was alive, I began to watch my life play out like a movie: meeting my husband, the birth of our children. The day-to-day life that I had bitched and moaned about now appeared to me like a distant fairytale dream. I let myself slip into disassociation. I thought about the real world around me and in that moment, I chose to live out the rest of my time in a beautiful delusion.

I had fallen into psychosis before, but this time I knew that whatever delusions my mind would concoct would be better than the truth: I would never see my family again, and worse, they would never know what happened to me. My breathing became shallow, lulling me to sleep, and I could hear muffled voices near me. 

“Our Father…” she began, “who art in Heaven…” The woman who had helped me when I arrived was by my side, and she was praying. I looked up at her, my hair stuck to my face, now drenched in tears and saliva. Her eyes were closed as she held my face in her hands. I felt the brief sense of comfort that comes with final confessions before dying. 

“I’m okay with dying…” I thought. 

“Don’t be.” I heard her say. I realized I had said my thoughts out loud. 

“What do I do now?” I asked. I looked away from her to stare at the darkness in front of me. 

I heard a sigh– not one of frustration, but of uncertainty. 

“Live.” she finally said.
