*MONDAY*

This was supposed to be my one day off. But, when you have a skeleton crew and someone doesn't show up, you get called to come in. Not by the manager or a coworker, you sort of just... *know*. I can't explain it- like a lot of things around here. But somehow, you find yourself driving to work and clocking in. So, here I am. Beginning what will be a seven-day stretch. 

I work at a small grocery store called The Emporium, located smack dab in the middle of town. Being centrally located, we see it all; the good, the bad, and everything in between. If you work retail in any capacity yourself, you'll understand when I say- you experience the full spectrum of humanity here. 

The word 'emporium' itself, belongs to a dead language. And, they *do* say that Latin is often used in things like magic and witchcraft. But, I don't know if that means anything. It'd make sense, though... I just honestly try not to question things around here too much. Doesn't do a lot of good. Most of the time, anyway. 

I mainly stock shelves. But I can, and often do, pretty much *everything* around here. A lot of us have to be cross-trained, just because of the high turnover rate. As soon as we hire a new cashier, they quit. Sometimes, they don't even show up for the first shift after the interview. Lucky them, I guess. 

Tonight, I'm closing with Paul. He's a pretty chill guy, most of the time. Long-timer, like me. He does have a few *quirks*, but... I'm used to it. Everyone here does. Shit, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit weird, too. You have to be to work here.

One of Paul's little quirks was his regularly scheduled 'freak-outs'. Usually, right before it was time for him to have a smoke, a customer would ask Paul a question, and he'd lose it. Could be as simple as 'Which aisle is the bread on?'. Didn't matter. Sure as shit, Paul came slamming through the warehouse doors, dragging a body behind him. 

"God dammit, Paul! I just clocked in!" I yelled at him. 

"Hey man, don't fucking worry about it, alright? I got it." He said. 

"Whatever." I replied. "Just make sure you shrink-wrap it good enough this time. The bailer still fucking stinks."

I grabbed a mop and bucket and went out onto the sales floor to see if there were any 'spills' needing taken care of. Space Goth was shopping. We don't know her real name, so that's what we call her. Don't ask. She was wearing fuzzy, leopard print earmuffs this time, and singing 'Jingle Bells' off-key at the top of her lungs. *It's the middle of June.* But, I only had to ask her to pull her pants back up just once tonight. So, that's progress. 

Thankfully, Paul had been careful to not make a mess this time, so I rolled the mop bucket back to the janitor closet and started loading my cart with backstock to fill. I'd counted out five cases of water that I needed for the shelf and loaded them up, but when I looked back at my cart, they'd turned into cases of toilet paper. I could already tell it was going to be a long night.

At about 6:30 PM, The Hum started. It usually comes through on the intercom system around that time, but no one can hear it, except me. Drives me fucking nuts, so I take it as my cue to go on break. That's what I'm doing right now, as I write this on my phone. I forgot to bring dinner, and you can't exactly eat anything from here, so I honestly don't have anything better to do.

At least when you work the night shift, one thing you don't have to deal with is The Earlybirds. You know the type. They show up about an hour before the store even opens. A whole fucking crowd of 'em, desperately clawing at the doors, faces smashed up against the glass, just begging to be the first ones let in. That's why you *cannot* go outside before we open. But, once 8:00 rolls around, you're safe. Fuckers just up and disappear as soon as the damn door unlocks.

The only cashier on duty tonight is Tilly. Which means, I *know* I'm gonna be called up there to help out at some point. Tilly is slow as shit, but she can't really help it. She's super old, and it takes her forever to get through a sale because she's too worried about picking up all the rotting pieces of flesh that keep falling off of her. I keep telling her to just pick them all up at the end of the night, but she insists on keeping her register tidy, she says.

Lenny just walked into the break room, humming some obscure hymn and holding his can of sardines. I don't even know why I bother coming in here, can't get a moments worth of peace. Lenny is supposed to be in charge of cleaning and maintenance, but he does more of making a mess  around here than anything else. The man is always dripping. It's like this thick, black, fish-smelling goop that the fucker seems to sweat out constantly. 

"Tom, you're needed to the registers." I hear blaring from the intercom speakers. 

Here we go. At least it gives me an excuse to get up and leave without seeming rude. Not that Lenny even has the capacity for that level of social awareness. 

Tilly is swamped. Eight customers in her line, and she's literally falling apart. I hop on register 2 and clear them all out within 15 minutes. When I look over, Tilly's gone outside for a smoke. I swear, sometimes I think she's tearing extra pieces of her flesh off on purpose, just to get out of working. 

I finished all the stocking I needed to do by the time 9:00 PM arrived. Took me three tries, but the water had been filled. I walked over to the time clock and punched my number in, only to be faced with the harsh words of,

*Employee #0164 is not currently clocked in. Would you like to clock in now?*

See what happens [tomorrow.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/zYA1khekqu)
