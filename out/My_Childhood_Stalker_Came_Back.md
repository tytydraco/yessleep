I don’t really know where to begin with this, most of the nitty gritty details happened long enough ago that time kind of fogged them over. I’ll just start at the beginning.

  
All of this started when I was about six years old.

  
I didn’t have any friends when I was in school. I don’t really know why, I guess I just had that ‘weirdo vibe’ that made the other kids steer clear, if not outright want to torment me. But that meant I never had anyone to play with during recess, so I often just sat there alone until it was time to go back inside.

  
The day I first met my stalker was like any other day. It was recess and I was alone, when I felt a soft thud on the back of my head.

  
I was used to the other kids doing stuff like that, so I looked around to see who threw something at me. See, normally, there would be some type of give away. I would see a group huddled together giggling while sneaking glances my way, or I would see some other kid high fiving his best friend or something like that. But I didn’t see anything like that this time. Every other kid was engaged in their own activity, not one of them looked my way for even a second.

  
I looked down to see what was thrown at my head. It was a piece of paper crumpled up into a ball. I picked it up to inspect it further. The paper looked like it was torn out of a notebook and smelled sweet like perfume. I uncrumpled the paper and there was something written on it.

  
“You look like a lonely kid. Do you want a Friend?”

  
That was the first time I had ever felt a sense of inherent wrongness. There was just something fundamentally incorrect about the situation that I could feel even as a little kid. It made no sense, no one ever wanted to be my friend, and even at that age, I was sure that this wasn’t how you were supposed to make them. I looked around again, trying even harder to see who threw the paper because I was certain at that point that it was some sort of prank. But still, nothing.

  
That’s when I felt another thud on the back of my head.

  
I looked down again. Another paper ball. Same look, same perfume smell, another note.

  
“I’m behind the corner of the back fence if you want to play!!!”

  
The back fence was the limits of the playground, the place where the teachers wouldn’t let the kids play. It was a fairly normal area, except for the corner where the fence met the brick wall of the school building itself. That part of the fence was old, broken and rusted. I remember that not even the braver kids in my class wanted to go over there.

  
Me? I was a little wuss, so I always stayed as far away from the back fence as I could. I never wanted to get in trouble, and the fence gave me massive heebie jeebies. However, I knew I needed to be brave, confront my bullies, and make them stop messing with me. My parents taught me that when I first started school, and what better time to actually do it than with someone who was too afraid to torment me face to face. I tried to ignore the fact that my hands were shaking even just thinking about confrontation and marched over to the corner of the back fence, ready to confront what I thought was a new, or maybe old, bully.

  
It didn’t take long to get to that corner, but I was already regretting my decision. I was shaking with nerves. Not only was it against the rules to be there, but I was also there to stand up to a bully, something I had never done before. Normally, the corner smelled like rust and dirty rainwater. But, when I went over there, it smelled sweet, like roses and candy.

  
I will never forget the voice I heard, never forget those words it spoke to me.

  
“So, you decided you want to be my friend?”

  
You see, I never saw my stalker’s face back then. For the most part, he was just a raspy voice with a silly accent that I later realized was British. His voice was weirdly calming, if that makes sense. Every time he spoke, it was like I would get the feeling of being wrapped in a warm blanket on a cold night. Maybe that’s why I didn’t just run away, why my ‘Stranger Danger’ alarm never went off. Even with my parents, we were a paycheck-to-paycheck household, so I had never felt that level of security before.

  
I really did want to be his friend.



\----------------------------------------



He called himself “Smiling Nigel Pickering,” or just “Smiling Nigel,” and he was my only friend for two years when I was a child.

  
I used to think his name was fun and silly, so I never bothered to question how bizarre it was he called himself that.

  
Like I had said before, I never saw Smiling Nigel. He would speak to me from the back corner of the fence on the playground, from behind curtains, from sewer grates, and even the walls of my bedroom when he got bold. He used to always say that he was playing a game of hide and seek with every person on the planet, so he had to keep hidden. The most I would ever see of him was the occasional ruffle of whatever he hid behind, so I would know he was really there.  


That used to get me in trouble a lot. Since he would never want to be seen, I would have to go out of my way to talk to him. I can’t even begin to recount how many times I got yelled at by teachers or scolded by my parents, just because I wanted to talk to my friend.

  
We used to play all sorts of games together. One game I remember us playing way too often was one he called ‘The Whistling Game.’ Nigel used to make me hop around while whistling and chanting.  


For some reason, I remember that chant clear as day.

  
“Oh, who’s the greatest whistler?  
Smiling Nigel!  
Oh, He’s the greatest whistler  
But Kenny’s up there too!”

  
I started to not mind having no other friends. It used to bother me like crazy, but after I met Nigel, I barely noticed that the other kids in school would avoid me, didn’t notice that they clearly loathed when they were forced to interact with me. Smiling Nigel Pickering was all I needed.

  
Nigel helped me out a bunch. I used to get him to help me with my homework all the time. But I remember him helping me the most with my bullies. I would tell Nigel about whatever kid was picking on me that day, and he would get really quiet and really mad. It was kind of scary how he could switch from friendly and comforting to icy and angry on a dime. He would leave and I wouldn’t be able to talk to him no matter how much I tried. He would come back, and after that, whoever was picking on me would never bother me again. They would seem terrified to even be near me.

  
Then, there was Billy Kaufman.

  
Despite being three years older than me, Billy was probably my biggest bully back then. Where most other kids would pick on me indirectly, Billy was out here giving me wedgies, shoving me into walls, punching me, all that jazz. If you’ve ever seen one of those old Disney show bullies, you’ve seen Billy Kaufman. He used to always call me “Betty” because I “Wasn’t man enough for a boy’s name.” Billy would tell me that if I told a teacher or either of our parents, he would only start beating me up worse, so I just took his torment almost every single day, not wanting it to get worse.

  
One day, I just got fed up. I can’t even remember what he did, not that it matters now, but I do remember that I finally told Smiling Nigel all about him. I had only wanted to tell Nigel about that one day, but I just kept going, venting about everything Billy had done to me. I remember Nigel getting quiet. Not the usual angry quiet, this one was almost gleeful. He told me that I would never have to see Billy Kaufman ever again before I heard him shuffling off.

  
Billy didn’t show up to school the next day.

  
Or the day after that.  


People got concerned, a missing persons report was filed and the search for Billy was started.  


Billy Kaufman was found dead in his bedroom three days after I had told Nigel about him.

  
The cause of death had been ruled as a strangulation, and an investigation began. Billy’s father David was arrested for the crime soon after, the amount of DNA evidence connecting him to the murder was staggering. David Kaufman was a gentle man, a friendly face in town that pretty much everyone liked, not someone who seemed capable of such a horrific act. David Kaufman was adamant that he didn’t do it, that his dad used to hit him, so he would never put hands on his own kids. David also claimed that he didn’t have any memory of committing the crime, but that didn’t matter. Billy was dead and David’s fingerprints were all over the scene. He did it, and there was no reason to believe otherwise.

  
I remember feeling so hollow when I heard the news. Sure, Billy was my bully, he sucked, but I never wanted anything bad to happen to him, I just wanted him to leave me alone. Not even the cute doggy that was brought into the classroom helped me feel better. I asked Nigel if he had anything to do with it, if he had gone and said something to Billy’s dad to make him angry enough to hurt Billy, but Nigel said nothing. He just dodged the question and tried to get me to play the Whistling Game again. But I wasn’t in the mood to play.



\----------------------------------------



After that day, I stopped seeing Nigel as my friend.

  
How could I not? Every time I talked to Nigel, I was reminded of Billy, which made me never want to talk to him. I think on some level, I had gotten it into my head that Billy’s death was my fault. Maybe if I hadn’t told Nigel, he would still be alive. I stopped playing with him as much. I think that’s what made him mad.

  
I remember being home alone one weekend, sitting on the living room floor doing a puzzle. This wasn’t uncommon as my parents had to work a lot. Before, it would be when Smiling Nigel and I would play the most, but it just felt eerie that day, as lonely as my life was before Nigel.

  
I heard his voice for the first time in more than a week.

  
“Now will you play with me?”

  
What used to be the most comforting voice on Earth, just brought me back to being tortured by Billy Kaufman, and how I’d actually prefer that to him being dead. I didn’t respond to Nigel.

  
“Come on, Kenny. Let’s have some fun!”

  
Still nothing out of me. That must have made him snap because his next words panicked me to my bones.

  
“PLAY WITH ME, YOU INGRATE!”

  
I had never heard Nigel raise his voice before, even when he was mad at my bullies, he would get quiet. He also never used to insult me; it was always nothing but compliments and encouragements. It was scary when Nigel would get mad at other kids, but to have him direct his anger at me filled me with a terror that went beyond existential.

  
I scrambled off the floor and booked it out the front door, not caring about putting my shoes on or grabbing a jacket. I just ran and ran and ran, desperate to get away from my house, from Nigel.

  
I was found hours later. I was huddled up in the woods, shivering and crying as the sun went down. My next-door neighbor, Mr. Brunson, was the one that found me. What I was told happened was that my mom had come home, saw the front door wide open with me nowhere to be found, and immediately called the cops and my dad. A search party was formed and they found me.

  
When the police asked me what happened, I told them everything. From Smiling Nigel, all the way to how I was convinced that Billy’s death was my fault.  


The police searched my house, and that’s when they found him.

  
Smiling Nigel Pickering turned out to be an old man, like, he looked decrepit from the small glimpse I got of him. They found him in the attic, equipped with sleeping gear that had seemingly been there for years. He had an ID on him. “Kenneth Whitehead” was his name, apparently. He was ninety-four years old.

  
Kenneth claimed to have no idea what he was even doing there. He straight up tried to act like he didn’t even know he was in the US. Nobody bought that. He was arrested and charged with stalking a minor. My parents also had to come to terms with the fact that he was in and out of our house for at least two years.



\----------------------------------------



My folks had gathered what little money we had and moved far away.

  
We couldn’t really stay in that house; it was compromised and carried too many bad vibes. Not to mention, my story became the talk of the town, and my parents weren’t comfortable with me being the center of attention in that manner.

  
After some time and a whole lot of “math tutoring” that turned out to be covert therapy sessions, I was able to put Smiling Nigel behind me.

  
At my new school, I was actually able to fit in for once. I made real friends. I was able to live a normal life, graduate, and age into adulthood as a relatively normal person.

  
I would occasionally think of Smiling Nigel, but I always had the luxury of that being in the past.

  
Until recently.

  
A few days ago, I was on a jog in the park, when I felt a soft thud on the back of my head.

  
I froze. My body started to feel cold, and it felt like there were billions of familiar eyes staring right at me. I prayed that it wasn’t what I thought it was and looked down to see a crumpled up paper ball. I picked it up and, sure enough, it smelled like perfume. I looked around, hoping that this was some misunderstanding, or something. There was no one around.

  
This could not be happening. That motherfucking creep was either in jail or dead. I was sure of it. Still, despite my terror, I had to know if there was a note, so I uncrumpled the paper.

  
“Hello Kenny! It's been so long!! I’d like to play again!!!”

  
I didn’t bother staying for even a second longer.

  
I dropped the paper and ran, ran like a was a little kid again. It didn’t matter how stupid I must’ve looked; I just wanted to get away.

  
I have spent the last few days cooped up at my place. I’ve been trying to hype myself up, to get myself to at least step out the front door, but I can’t do that just yet. I feel just like I did when I was hiding in those woods. I feel small, afraid, and stupid for thinking I’d ever be safe.  


I’ve at least convinced myself that maybe, just maybe, if I write my story down, it’ll help in some way. Maybe someone will have answers or advice, or something that can help me if the worst-case scenario is true.

  
I’m praying that it’s not.
