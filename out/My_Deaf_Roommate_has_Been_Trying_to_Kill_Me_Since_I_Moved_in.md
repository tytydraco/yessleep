I just recently moved into an apartment with a deaf man, and ever since I moved in, he’s been acting strange. I needed a new apartment to stay in after my ex cheated on me with another man. He and I were together for six months and decided to get our own place. We were great, never got into any arguments, did chores together, and watched all kinds of shows and movies as a couple. It was only a couple of weeks in when we started arguing, always about little things, such as chores or if I mentioned a friend, especially if it was a guy. Every fight we had drifted us further apart. Until one day I came home from work and saw him and another man on the couch, completely naked. God, how I wish I had never found out. I yelled at him and ran out of the apartment crying. I went back a couple of hours later to get my stuff and leave. He didn't even try to confront me; he just sat on that filthy couch in silence.

I had to wait a few weeks for the lease to end so I could move on, sometimes sleeping in my car or at work. Then I came across an ad on Craigslist. (NEED NEW ROOMMATE: RENT $150/MONTH). I was excited and replied as fast as I could. I didn’t bother reading most of the post, just that his last roommate had moved away, and that he was deaf.

I didn’t find anything wrong with the post; the only thing I was wary about was that he was deaf. Only after I replied was I curious about how we would communicate, since I didn’t know any sign language. He was quick to respond, saying I could move in whenever I liked. I asked about the communication between us if I moved in. He assured me that I wasn’t a problem since he had notepads all around the apartment, as well as reading lips. I told him I’d be there tomorrow, and he sent me the address with a thumbs-up emoji.

The next morning, I made my way over to the man’s apartment. It was in a rough neighborhood, but I needed a place to stay, and $150 is a great deal. I went up the shaky stairs to the man’s door and knocked, only to realize that he wouldn’t hear it. I texted him I was there, and he opened up the door, like he was waiting for me. I was a bit startled when he flung the door open, but I put on a quick smile and reached to shake his hand.

“Hi! It’s nice to meet you. I’m Morgan.”

He grabbed my hand firmer than I expected and outstretched his arm to welcome me in. The inside of the apartment was very clean and tidy; a lot nicer than I expected from the outside of the building. The apartment had four rooms: one bathroom, two bedrooms, and the living room/kitchen. He follows behind me close into the apartment, so close actually that I could feel his breath on my neck. I played it off, thinking that maybe his social skills weren’t that great. 

He sits down at the dining table behind the couch in the living room and offers for me to sit down. I sat down across from him as he started to write on his notepad. 

“You’re alone?” I was a bit puzzled by his question.

“Yes, I am. Are you sure 150 is enough? This place is really nice.”

He scribbles down on his notepad.

“Yes. Rent is $150. The landlord and I have an agreement.”

“Ah, okay. I only plan on staying for a couple of months until I can get my own place.”

“It’s no problem. As long as you pay, you can stay for as long as you like.”

“Thank you, I really appreciate it!”

He smiles and nods his head and asks if I’d like anything to eat, I declined but thanked him again for the offer. 

After our exchange, he showed me to my room, and I went in to unpack. The room was bare, with only a bed set up with a TV on the dresser. He stayed by the door and watched me unpack everything for 15 minutes before going into the living room. I stayed in my room most of the day to set up my room and unwind. I only heard him get up from the living room a handful of times to go into the kitchen and slam the cabinets around. Apparently, he doesn't know how loud those cabinets are; it sounded like thunder the way they echoed into my room. I went out and tapped him on the shoulder to let him know I was done and heading to bed soon. He grabbed the notepad off the couch next to him and started writing.

“I ordered pizza online if you wanted any. Should be here soon.”

I told him, 'Sure,' and joined him on the couch, turning on the TV. The TV  flickered on with the biggest subtitles I’ve ever seen; they took up a good half of the TV. I started flipping through channels for a while until he snatched the remote from my hand and put on reruns of ‘The Twilight Zone’. I didn’t complain since it was his TV and I love the show anyway. 

Only 10 minutes go by before I hear a knock at the door. I tap him on the shoulder and tell him the pizza is here. He nods, and I get up to answer the door. I get the pizza and place it on the dining table. I tell him I have to use the bathroom first, and he gives me a thumbs-up for going to the table. I come back into the living room, and he has a slice for me ready on a plate. He waves his hand towards it to have me join him. I sit and look at the slice, and it looks like he has put Parmesan on it for me already. I took a bite, and it was chalky with a slightly sour taste; I thought maybe it had expired.

We finished the meal, and I thanked him again, letting him know I was heading to bed. He grabbed his notepad and said it was his pleasure, then told me to get some sleep. I go to bed and wake up a couple of times with stomach pains. I had to keep going to the bathroom all night. Luckily, the bathroom was right across from my room. I didn’t get any sleep.

I got up in the morning and saw him at the dining table, looking out the window until he noticed me. He had a coffee waiting for me. I sit down and sip on the coffee. Then I saw him writing.

“How’d you sleep?”

“Not great, I think that pizza made me sick.”

“Sorry, I’m not feeling well either.”

“I’m taking a sick day, I need some sleep.”

“Hope you feel better.”

I said ‘You too’ before going back to bed. It was almost noon by the time I woke up again. I open my eyes to see him standing at the foot of my bed with a kitchen knife. I was terrified, but he panicked and shook his head and arms around. He grabbed his notepad from his pocket.

“I thought I saw a mouse.”

“Can you not do that in my room?! You gave me a heart attack!”

He apologized and left my room. 

After that, we didn’t interact too much, just in passing. Whenever I left for work or to get groceries, he was always home, reading. I don’t think he worked or ever left the apartment. He was always there when I was. 

My friend texted me asking to see my new apartment. I agreed since I hadn’t seen her in forever. She knocked, and I answered the door and greeted her. I introduced her to my new roommate, and he seemed displeased. He went to write on his notepad.

“Nice to meet you. I didn’t know we were having company.”

“Sorry, I should have asked.” He put on a fake smile.

“It’s okay, I’m heading to my room.”

My friend and I sat on the couch and talked about everything going on. She asked what it was like living with a deaf man. I said it wasn’t too bad and joked, saying he didn’t talk much. She stayed for a while and left when night came around. I texted my roommate saying she was gone, but he never responded by the time I went to bed.

In the middle of the night, I woke up in my dark room, with a heavy weight on me, unable to move. The man was on top of me with his hands around my neck. I was barely able to breathe. I struggled with him, trying to get him off. I was able to reach the alarm clock on my nightstand and hit him with it. He finally let go. I grabbed my phone and ran into the bathroom, locked the door, and called the police.

“Police have been dispatched to your location. They’ll be there soon. Please stay on the line.

My whole body was pressed against the door. He pounded harder and harder on the door to get in. I was crying and sobbing, wishing it would end. He stepped away from the door, and I had some sense of relief for a second. I heard him run into his room, only to run back to the door. This time, he pounded the door with something heavy. My heart sank.

“Please hurry! He has something! He’s trying to kill me!” 

“We’ll be there in a minute, ma’am.”

Each pound of the door was thunderous. Each time he would hit the door, I would hear a crack—only a few swings in, he had made an opening into the door. He tried reaching in to unlock the door, and I hit his hand as hard as I could. He let out an awful scream of pain before swinging at the door again. 

He finally broke in with the hammer he had used. I ripped off the shower rod and hit him with it, but it didn’t do much. He swung the hammer into my side, feeling my ribs crack. I winced in pain before he hit me in my shoulder, only missing my head by a few inches. I was on the ground, barely lucid, before the police finally showed up and grabbed him. They took him in the police cruiser and called an EMT for me.

They got statements from both of us. Apparently, he claimed I attacked him first, and he wants to sue me for the whole thing. We have court in the morning, but I wanted to make this public. DO NOT LIVE WITH A DEAF MAN BY THE NAME QUINCY SMITH. If something seems too good to be true, don’t take the bait.
