This happened about 20 years ago, my mum and grandma told me this story.

My mum was pregnant with one of my elder sisters or maybe just got birth to one of them, doesn’t really matter but she was very weak at that time and could barely do stuff on her own.
Basically she called her mum, so my grandma, to help her clean their flat. Dad was typically working all day.
So my grandma got to work and started cleaning the flat of my parents, even tho she was very mentally very stressed herself.
Recently her two other kids in teenage years (so my uncle and aunt) had been fighting like never before, raising hands on each other and all that, but it was really really bad, one even bruised the other really bad till they threw up. So at that time, home was really chaos for my grandma. Obviously my grandpa was also working all day, every day.

My grandma is a extrem perfectionist when it comes to cleaning so she really cleans every bit of the home.
She comes to an end when she wanted to brush off dust from the wall clock in the living room.
As she removes the clock from the wall a tiny tiny sphere of aluminum foil falls from the backside of the clock.
She was surprised by it and thought it’s strange but just threw it away.
She returned to cleaning, but couldn’t stop thinking about what that was and why was it up there.
She got curious and took it out the bin. And she threw it back again.
It went like this for a few times, but she eventually picked it out again and decided to open the aluminumfoil-sphere.
She found all kind of stuff there, all fitting into this tiny sphere. Nails (human nails), hair, some writings on some type of skin/leather (in Arabic i think), and even quicksilver. As she opened it the quicksilver shattered and spread all over the table. She says there was nearly no way to collect it all again but she still somehow managed to collect it.
She was shocked and knew in what direction that was going, but who put that up there, and why, and what should she do with it?
She called her mum to ask what to do with it, she had told her to flush it down the toilet (apparently it's better to burn it tho).

Time goes by and my grandma notices that my uncle and aunt aren’t having these outrageous fights anymore. Yeah siblings fighting is normal but she thinks that this event is somehow linked to the little sphere she found.

But who did it. So time went by and one day a relative from my dads side somehow (don’t know how it came to that) confesses that they did that. They put that piece of black magic up there, apparently it should have kept the family of the person who did this together, but in turn sacrificed the peace of another household.

I think the quicksilver packed into this little sphere symbolized the forced family bond of the person that put that behind the clock.

Blackmagic/sihir is really a scary topic especially cuz it can most likely only come from people close to you.
And if any lf you plans to do something like this please don’t! Even if u use it for something good for yourself, your sacrifice another happiness for yours. Stay away from it. Stay safe.
