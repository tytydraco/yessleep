I had almost missed my bus that day. Part of me wishes I had, but it wouldn't have stopped what happened. Sandy still would have shown up to Grandma Kelly's apartment, she still would have had to go through all her things, and she still would have gotten that damned necklace. I didn't miss the bus. I somehow managed to reach the door just before the bus driver actually took off, and apparently he was in a good mood because he reopened the doors to let me in without so much as an eye roll.

The whole ride into the city was choking. I had put on a podcast to try to drown out my thoughts and stop myself from crying quite so publicly, but it didn't work.

My parents died in a car crash when I was just a baby, so my twin sister, Sandy, and I grew up with our paternal grandparents. Life with them was generally lovely, but we got bullied pretty bad in elementary school. Kids are cruel, and having dead parents fuels their fire enough without adding being raised by lesbian grandparents to the mix.

Grandma Lauran passed away a few years back, just old age as far as any professionals could tell, but given she was only in her late fifties… I’m sorry but I just don't buy it. Either way, the event left me with only Sandy and Grandma Kelly for family. That is, until two weeks ago when Grandma Kelly was found dead by her landlord. The coroners say she wasn't in pain, she had an aneurysm and was dead before she even hit the ground. Not a bad way to go if you ask me. Still, I had just become freshly nineteen years old and the only family I could call my own was Sandy... She was all I had left to live for.

Sandy was already there when I showed up at the lobby of Grandma Kelly’s building. We were both shaky, and I saw Sandy twitch as she was about to open up for a hug, but she resisted, a silent agreement to remain as stoic as possible for the time being. The landlord handed Sandy the key, and motioned us along. He knew that we already knew the way, and let us go up on our own, I guess for privacy. When we reached the door, we both stopped abruptly. Neither one of us daring to move, but we had to eventually, so before I could change my mind, I forced my limp hand to pick at the key which fell from Sandy's grasp with no resistance, and opened the door.

I stepped into the apartment, and everything went numb. I could see the living room that was almost empty except for the sparse furniture scattered throughout. Aside from that? I'd completely lost my senses, I couldn't smell the lavender candle she always burned, or hear any noise coming from in or out of the apartment, everything outside the window was a blur. I have no idea how long I'd been standing there, trying and failing to process everything. I did eventually break from my trance, though, and heard a small snuffling sound from behind me.

I turned around, and saw Sandy piled into a heap on the floor. The sound had been coming from her, she'd been crying. When she looked up it was clear to me that she'd been crying for some time, and from the looks of the burst blood vessels in her eyes, she'd been crying hard and was just beginning to calm down.

I felt something wet streak down my face and realized I'd been crying too. My legs gave way and I collapsed onto the floor beside her where we sat and cried until we were both reduced to hiccups, gasps and gags.

I felt a hand on my shoulder, shaking me violently until I opened my eyes and found myself laying on the floor. The sun outside the window was beginning to set. Sandy informed me that I had fallen asleep so instead of disturbing me she took the liberty of hauling all of Grandma Kelly's boxes out of the storage closet. It was at this point that I remembered why we were there in the first place. We had to sort her belongings. We were the only family she had left too, so whatever we didn't want to keep of hers, it was our job to sell or donate it.

I got up as she shoved a box towards me, and opened one for herself to sort too. One by one we went through each item. Books, clothes, jewelry, and such. We made decisions on who would keep what, and tried to get rid of as little things as possible. When I came across a clamshell box, I immediately knew it would be something for Sandy. 

I turned it over and saw "Lauren" scratched into the fabric. When I opened it, I found a clock necklace, one of those really old ones that you had to wind up every week. It was about the size of a looney, had a gold colour to it and on a long, gold chain that would have the clock hang around your chest when you put it on.

I handed it to Sandy, and she appeared to have recognized it. She just stared at it for a moment before gingerly picking it up between her index finger and her thumb. She squeezed it in the palm of her fist and cradled it against her chest as she closed her eyes and made a sound that was somewhere between a sigh and a hum. It took us all night to finish going through the stuff after that. She seemed... unfocused, I never mentioned it, but I repeatedly caught her stopping to just stare at the necklace. Sometimes for a single minute, sometimes for up to ten. It was almost three in the morning by the time we'd started heading home, and I had to call a taxi because the night bus doesn't go near my building.

The next morning, we had a Sunday brunch to go to at the diner near my place. I'm not one for brunches, myself. I always thought it was a girlish activity, but it was more time with my sister so I never complained. I was barely conscious by the time I staggered in and fell into a seat at the table. I was shocked to see Sandy not only seemed alive, but completely rejuvenated. There wasn't even one indication that she had only slept a few hours, or that she was grieving.

Needless to say, this brunch was not the most social one on my part. For as hard as I tried, I just couldn't seem to focus on anything and any time I did manage to absorb a word or two, it was always Sandy rattling on about that necklace, I still can't fathom how she possibly could have had that much to say about it. What did not escape unnoticed was the excessive use of hand sanitizer. Every time one of our friends so much as breathed in her direction she would compulsively wipe down not only herself, but also the clock with a liquid that might as well have just been straight ethanol.

The week only got weirder from there. By Tuesday she had completely shut herself into her apartment. She allowed visitors at first, but only if they wore gloves and put plastic over their shoes. She's never been a germaphobe in any sense of the word, but I somewhat understood once I saw the glass display case that contained the necklace safely behind at least a dozen locks. That whole visit she barely heard a word I said, constantly cleaning around the box, and double, triple and quadruple checking that the locks were secure. Exactly once she left me and the box out of her sight so she could grab a new rag, and she spent that whole time calling across the apartment lecturing me about how the clock was hers, as if she thought I was about to steal it. Upon her return, she promptly ushered me out the door with the promise that she would call me the next day at six in the evening.

On Wednesday I rolled out of bed, shortly before noon. I grabbed my phone, as I always do first thing in the morning and saw that I had forty missed calls from Sandy. I checked most of the voicemails and most were just incoherent rambling, but a few were her saying that she was calling just as she promised she would and was wondering where I was. She said it was nearly eight and I should be home from whatever I was doing by now. I checked the time and sure enough it was 11:54am on Wednesday, the morning after my visit with her and hours yet before she was supposed to call me. By that point I was already fearing for her well-being, but the last voicemail made my blood run frozen. It was mere minutes after the rest of them, but she sounded panicked as she asked why everyone was ignoring her. She said she hadn't spoken to anyone in weeks and she was lonely.

At that, I shot out of the bed and raced to her apartment on foot, in nothing but my boxers and a hoodie. I felt a mixture of confusion and terror. I was confused, because she had never had any history with psychosis or anything that resembled this in any way, nor did we have a family history of anything that could have preceded this. I was also terrified of what I might find, but I pushed through. She was my sister and nothing was going to stop me from getting her the help she certainly needed. I was too late though, when I'd finally managed to open a window and wedge myself through, what waited for me was the sight of an old woman dead in my sister's bed.

The coroner's results came back yesterday, and I've been trying to process it. There are only two parts that are important, though. The DNA tests confirm that the old woman was in fact my nineteen year old sister, and she died peacefully of old age.

Our friend says I should get a dog. You know, to help me be less lonely moving forward, but I have a feeling that is the most irresponsible thing I could do right now.
