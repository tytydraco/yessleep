It was around 10 pm. I was going to brush my teeth in the bathroom right outside my bedroom. Everything felt kinda off that day but I just ignored it. Earlier I heard something moving under my bed and I was hearing my mom calling my name from downstairs but she said she never called for me. I know what was underneath my bed wasn’t my dog, Oswald, because he isn’t allowed in my room and my door was closed. So anyway when I went to the bathroom, looked in the mirror above the sink, and felt something under my foot. You know that feeling of when you step on someone’s hand and they pull away? Yeah, so that’s what I felt. I looked down and nothing was there but my foot was wet all of a sudden. I nearly jumped out of my skin when something started shaking the glass shower doors. Me and my siblings always have paranormal experiences and we make jokes but this experience genuinely made me scared of going to that bathroom and every time I go in I always look at my feet when I stand by that sink.

Later that night I kept getting the feeling that I was being watched. The house was making noises but I thought it was just because it’s old, then around 2 AM my door nob started rattling for about 30 seconds and I was shaking, I almost screamed when I felt a hand on the back of my neck, it was cold and it felt like the fingers were long and frail. Me and my sister shared a room at this time and I was always having sleep paralysis but I know for a fact that wasn’t what it was. When I did fall asleep I actually had sleep paralysis and all that happened was I saw an old woman and a child at the end of my bed staring at me. The scariest part is the I had the top bunk and I found out the next morning that my grandma had passed away in the middle of the night. The woman I saw resembled her but she looked odd, not like ugly odd but like inhuman odd. She had a smile going from ear to ear and her eyes looked like they were about to fall out of her head. I don’t know who the child was but they had hair to their shoulders and had a hospital gown on with the same smile but they looked like they were in pain and it was hurting them to smile.

My friends say that it was my grandmother saying goodbye but I don’t think that was her. It was almost like someone or something was wearing her skin. I had problems with sleeping for awhile but I have gotten better. I have had more experiences but none have compared to that one.

Also sorry if that was confusing I’m not very good at telling stories.
