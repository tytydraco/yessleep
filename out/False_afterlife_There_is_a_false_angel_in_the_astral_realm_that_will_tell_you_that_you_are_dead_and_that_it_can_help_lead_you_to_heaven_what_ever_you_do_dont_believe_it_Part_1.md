As long as I remember, ever since I was little, I remember having astral projections. It's been so long that I don't even remember the first one I had. I always thought that astral projection was fun, but what has been happening here recently has been scaring the living crap out of me. The thing is, my younger brother has been in a coma for almost a year now, and slapping him does not wake him up. I tried; believe me, we tried everything under the sun. We tried to send him to a doctor, but the doctor did not know what was causing the coma. I did not know what caused my brother's coma, but over the past few days, I have been sitting in my room thinking about what caused it, and I would not come out of the room for days even if my mom would beg me to come out.

One night, I was thinking to myself in my room, What if it was that one time I did black magic that caused it? I woke up the next day, and my mom told me that they were going to give my brother another brain scan. My brother, who was in a coma, was put on a stretcher.

Me and my mom drove to the hospital to see what could be wrong with my brother. My mother is an atheist and does not believe in anything paranormal, and I told her, "Mom, ; this has to be black magic of some sort because one time I did play with it, and I'm sorry, and I admit it.". Mom "Oh, Doretha, don't be silly; black magic does not exist; we will get to the bottom of it and find out why he is in a coma.".

We got to the hospital, and my brother was put into an MRI machine. The doctor said there was nothing that she could do, as she could not find anything wrong with him. The thing is, Dr. Annie was the best doctor in the city, and everyone loved her. My mom got sad and angry, and tears were going down her face. "You better quit being a lazy doctor and find out what is wrong with my son." If you are going to be lazy, you need to stop being a doctor."

Dr. Annie looked at my mom and said, "It's been 8 whole hours of looking, and we can't find what is wrong with your son.". My brother was put out of the MRI machine and back on the stretcher, and they drove him home. Mom was touching him while they put him on the stretcher, and tears were rolling down Mom's face. "I will get to the bottom of this, and you will wake up, and I will find every doctor in the world if I have to.".

We drove home, and mom was sad and angry and was saying how that doctor is not a real doctor. By the time we got home, Mom went to her room, started sobbing, and locked the door, She was angry and sad. My brother was in the room downstairs, and I went downstairs and walked to his room and kissed him on the cheek. "Don't worry, brother, once you wake up, we will throw a big party and have lots of cake and candy.". I was thinking, What if my brother just dies soon and he never wakes up? I will never have a brother again. I was thinking to myself, No brother to play video games with, and I may not have him for much longer. I kissed my brother again on the cheek. Tears began to flow down my face, and I went back to my room. While in my room, I was wiping tears off my face and began to sob on my pillow. I love my brother.

I fell asleep that night and fell into sleep paralysis. I opened my eyes and realized there was vibrating all around my body. I knew this was my time to astral project, so I imagined a rope above me. I pulled on the rope and got out of my body. I went around the house, going through the walls and down the stairs. I went down to my brother's room and heard a voice. I realized I only heard this voice in my brother's room. The voice was a creepy one: "Come home, your time is up, and the pearly gates of heaven are waiting for you.". Then the voice said, "Come, follow me; your time on earth won't be much longer.". I then woke up and got back into my body. 

I was thinking to myself while sitting up in bed. Maybe I should check on my brother? I went down the stairs where my brother was, and his heart monitor was still beeping, which meant he was still alive.  What was this entity that was telling me my time was up and it was time to go to heaven?

I was now scared that I was going to die in a few days. What if that was an angel telling me I was going to die soon, and what was I going to die from? I got up, got ready for school, and showered. I then walked to school, and it was the first day of school. It was my first period, and a girl who was my best friend named Kelly was with me. I wanted to tell her about my brother, but the teacher was talking, so I waited until lunch to talk to Kelly.

At lunch, I told Kelly that my brother was in a coma, and he has been in one for a year. I told Kelly that we tried everything to find out what was wrong with my brother but could not find what was wrong with him. Kelly looked at me and said, "My little sister has been in a coma for a few months, and we can find anything wrong with her too.". Kelly then again said, "My sister is 9 years old, and she has been talking to her so-called best friend .".

I then said, "Tell me something else .". Kelly then said, "Look, there has been something weird going on around the neighborhood, and I have been seeing a lot less kids play outside here lately; it's like they have all been going missing.". Kelly told me I really don't know why your brother is in a coma, but we could not find anything wrong with my sister either.

Later that day, I went to sleep early. I wanted to see what this was. I laid my head down and heard my name being called over and over again, and I could not sleep at all. I went down the stairs in the living room to sleep, laid my head on the couch, and put the TV on so the voice could be drowned out. I fell asleep, woke up a few hours later, and was in sleep paralysis. My eyes were wide open, and I could see the whole living room. I looked around, and the TV was off and not making any sound. The door to my brother's room is behind me, where I'm not facing. 

It started out small; there was a feeling of presence, and I could sense it coming from my brother's room, even if I was facing away from the door of my brother's room. After a minute, the presence got very strong, to the point where it was right behind me. Then I heard a voice whispering in my ear, "You're not going to be alive for much longer. The pearly gates of heaven are waiting for you. It's time for you to go home.

I snapped out of the sleep paralysis and got up and walked to my brother's room. He is in bed, with the beeping heart monitor next to him. Maybe that was some silly hallucination I thought to myself.

I went back to sleep, woke up the next morning, got up, and got ready for school. After I got ready, I walked to the bus stop, and there are usually kids who play, but what was odd was that no kid was playing outside, and they usually play outside before school starts.

I was getting scared because I felt as if I was going to die soon because of that whole thing last night. I saw that a car was coming and got out of the road. "Phew, that was close." "I don't know what will kill me in a few days, but that was not it.". The bus then picked me up, and I stepped on the bus. While the bus was driving, it almost fell into a ditch, and that caused the other kids on the bus to scream. "Phew, thank God that was not my death.". The bus was fine, and it kept driving. 

We then got dropped off at school, and I walked in and went to class. In class, I could not focus because I was thinking about when I was going to die. Maybe it would be a tornado that hits the school or some earthquake. The teacher kept telling me to pay attention. I was getting paranoid because, throughout the day, I would look out the windows all around the school and see if there was anything outside that was a storm or a tornado coming, but there was nothing. The weather lady said a bad storm was coming today, but it was sunny.

At the lunch room, I thought maybe I would die from food poisoning. Yes, I did really think that would happen. At gym class, I thought I was going to die from being injured. At the end of the day, I went on the bus. I was very tired and did not have homework. Right when the bus dropped me off, I ran to my house, got to my room, and laid my head on my pillow. I fell asleep quickly. 

I woke up an hour later and was in sleep paralysis. I did the rope technique and got out of my body. This time was different because I wanted to travel far in the astral realm. I went down the stairs and saw my mother watching TV. I went out the door and floated through it.  I was in the neighborhood, and was floating around to see where I wanted to go. I went to my neighbor's house and saw my neighbors watching TV in their home. I went out of the neighbor's house.

I obviously planned to go way further than the neighborhood. So I went past the backyards of other people's homes. As I floated more, I was no longer in my neighborhood. I saw the old playground that me and my brother used to play on. There was this little girl on the swing who was crying. I did not interact with her because I thought she was in the physical realm that is, until she floated through the playground. I tried to speak to her, "Why are you crying?". The little girl saw me and said, "I'm lost and can't find my way home, the heavens are calling, and the angel is telling me to come back home.". Well, how did you get lost? "I don't know; I wondered around and can't seem to find my way back."

I saw a man walk out of the forest, but in an unnatural way. The man noticed the little girl , "Sweetie, it's you, my little girl; Haley, it's me, daddy.". The little girl was bubbling with joy. "Daddy, I have not seen you in years." "This is my time to lead you back home," while dad held the little girl's hand. "Come follow me." The dad and the little girl went to the woods.

I woke up, and it was getting dark. Was I in the astral realm for that long? I wanted to know more, so I went back to sleep, wondering what was in those woods. Why was her dad there, asking her to follow him in the woods? I fell into sleep paralysis quickly and floated out of my body. I then again floated out of the neighborhood. I went to where that playground was, and the girl and her dad were gone, but I went to the woods. I saw a glowing path that was leading somewhere. The longer I was on the path, the more I felt as if something was watching me. 

The feeling got stronger and stronger the longer I was on the path. I saw a blue door on the ground. The door opened on its own, and I walked inside. The door led somewhere else, and I was now in another world. There were woods, but they were very thick, to the point that sun barley hit the forest floor. I walked around these thick woods, and it was dead silent compared to the woods in the real world, where there were the sounds of birds and crickets.

I kept walking and felt as if I was being watched. I looked around to see what it was but did not see anything. I saw a cave in the woods and went into it. The cave was not dark, as there was light everywhere. There were many passageways in the cave. There were many twists and turns, and I walked through many passageways in the cave, where I eventually stumbled upon a red door. The door opened up, and I walked in. I was now in a different place than the thick forest.

This place was a cave system. Like I said, there was light in the cave. Keep in mind that this is another dimension in the astral realm. I was walking around this cave, and it was getting deeper and deeper. The thing was, there were people in this cave, but something was off about them. They seemed unhuman because they moved and acted in a weird way. It was a group of elderly people. "Hey, if you want to go where you want, enter the green door over there." I saw the green door over there and walked to it. The door opened up, and I walked in. I was now in a marble castle that was very tall, floor to ceiling.

As I walked, I realized this castle was big and had many black doors. I opened one of them and went in, and it was a hallway with many other black doors. I entered one of the black doors in the hallway, and it led to another hallway that had a lot of black doors. I then again entered another black door, and it led to a big room with a lot of beds with black doors besides them. In this room, I felt as if something was watching me again, and it creeped me out. I entered a door that was at the far end of the room. It led to another hallway, and this hallway this time was short, but I found a door at the end of the hallway. I entered it, and it was a small room with a brown door that looked like a door from a house.

I walked around this house and saw that it was just a normal house that shape shifted a little. I would walk around to the other parts of the house, start in the living room, walk to the hallway, and then go to the bedroom and lay on the bed for a few minutes. I saw the room changing a little. One second, a white dresser would be in the room, and then the next, a brown dresser would be in the room. I went out of the bedroom and saw that the whole hallway looked different and had changed. The hallway was now longer, and the wall paper was now red instead of white.

I saw that there was a door to the basement, and I opened it and went down the stairs. There I was in the basement, and there was a back door to the outside. I opened the door and went outside. This was the backyard in a deep forest. I began to walk into the forest, looking at the house behind me. I looked away, then looked back at the house, and it looked very different. Before I looked again, the house was a light green color, and after I looked back, it was now a light brown and a bit bigger.

I saw that the landscape was changing too. As I was walking, one second I would see hills, then I would see a flat field.  In this flat field, I saw a golden door that was glowing and shining. I opened the golden door, and there it was. I was on a cliff and saw the white stairs go up to the sky and angels singing. The angels were calling my name, Doretha Doretha. The heavens, your true home, are waiting for you. Come climb the stairs. Maybe I was dead, and this was it. This was my time to go home, and my time was up. I said all my good byes to my family in my head, thinking they were going to find me dead in bed. This was it; My time has come.

I then put my first step on the stairs, and I violently woke up in my bed in a sweat. It was 4:04 in the morning, and I went down stairs. My mom was cooking breakfast down stairs. "Hey, me and dad are going to your grandfather's grave today, I think you will be okay staying home today by yourself, Please stay home." Me "Okay, mom, I will stay home today by myself.". In my head, I was planning to go to the forest, where the playground was, as soon as mom walked out of the door.

I heard the front door open and the sound of mom walking in the car, and the car door slammed shut. This was my chance to go where the forest was in the playground. I wanted to see if that door was real in the physical world. I waited for any sign that Mom was completely gone. After waiting for 10 minutes, I looked out of the window and saw that no cars were there, so I opened the door. I walked outside and knew this would be a two and a half-hour walk to the playground. I walked, and there were no kids in the neighborhood. I have not seen kids in the neighborhood for a long time.

After a good two and a half hours of walking, I found the playground. There was a group of kids from the other neighborhood playing on the playground, and I tried to step into the forest, but as I did, I heard "don't go in there!". I yell, "Why should I not?"! "There's a monster that watches you in those woods!".

I yell, "I'm going in anyway! I don't care what you guys say!". I walk in the woods and immediately feel as if I am being watched, even if I turn around and don't see it. There it was a yellow trail in the woods. I ran and followed the path, and as I was on the path, I felt as if someone was watching me again, and it was getting stronger and stronger as I was on the path. After a while, as I was walking, the feeling got so strong that I felt it was right behind me, and I looked back and nobody was there.

There was the blue door; it was in the waking physical world. I opened it, and there were just bricks with bugs crawling. "I guess that you could only enter this door in the astral realm," I said to myself. Then I felt as if something was right behind me, and I ran as fast as I could and followed the trail. I did not see the thing, but the feeling was creeping me out. After a while, I made it out of the woods and back to the playground. The kids playing were gone, and I began to walk back home. After a few hours of walking, I made it back home. I opened the front door and got in the house, and I got lucky because, right as I got in the house, my mom drove right in the driveway. At least she did not find me not being in the house.

Mom "I really hope your brother makes it. It was hard seeing your grandfather's grave today; I nearly cried.". "I really hope he makes it too. I really don't know what's wrong with him.". Mom went to her room and cried, and as mom left and she went to her room, I felt as if someone was watching through out the house. "Whose there"! I looked back and saw that no one was there. I walked around the house, from the living room to the kitchen, to get snacks out of the pantry. I felt as if this thing was following me throughout the house. I heard the baby screaming in the room upstairs. I went upstairs to see what it was. I went inside the baby's room, and I swear to God I saw something moving in the corner of my eye.

When I looked to see what it was, it was not there. I heard mom yelling in the other room, "Can you put the baby's clothes in the washing machine?" ? "Okay, mom, I will." I went downstairs and put the baby's clothes in the washing machine, then went back up to the baby's room to fold the newly washed ones that were in the baby's room. I was folding the baby's clothes. I swear to God, I saw something moving in the corner of my eye, and it was moving for a good 10 seconds. The baby began to scream and cry. I looked behind me and saw nothing there but thin air.

I tried to calm the baby down, and I felt as if I had to put it in my room, where another crib was. I went into my room and put the baby in the crib that was in my room. The baby began to calm down after I put her in the crib. I went to bed and fell asleep. I fell into sleep paralysis, and my soul came out of my body. I wonder what I was going to see in the astral realm this time. I floated down the stairs to the kitchen and saw my grandfather, who had passed away two years ago. "Hey, it's my granddaughter, and the angels have been telling me it's time for you to come home with them."

I hugged my grandfather tight. "Oh, I miss you so much, Grandfather. I miss the good times we had together.". "Oh, my granddaughter, we are going to make new memories in heaven, as you don't have that much longer to live as cancer is spreading throughout your body.". "The angel is coming to guide you to the pearly gates where you belong, my granddaughter."

I saw the figure that had wings and was wearing a white robe with a hood on it. "That's the angel granddaughter; now follow it to the pearly gates.". I followed the angel, and it led to the outside and to the other neighborhood, where the playground was, into the forest, where the yellow path was. There it was the blue door from before.  The angel opened it and told me to follow it.

I entered the blue door and was in the thick forest from before. I followed the angel through the thick forest, and it led me to the cave where the red door was. I was in the cave when the angel led me through all the passageways and found the green door. I was now in the marble castle when the angel led me to the right black doors to the room where the brown door was, and I was now in the house from before. The angel led me to the basement of the house to the back door, and there was the forest from before in the back yard of the house where the golden door was. There I was after I entered the golden door and saw the white stairs to the sky. "I will walk you up to heaven; follow me as your time on earth is up."

I followed the angel up the stairs. I could hear other angels singing and telling me that my time was up and it was time to go to your home in the pearly gates. The angel led me to the top of the stairs. There stood the pearly gates, and it opened. I saw a beautiful landscape with sunflowers everywhere. In the distance, I saw a big playground with kids playing on it. "You will love it here and never want to come back to earth; there are arcades, water parks, and beautiful land to explore. You can eat all the sweets, candy, and cakes you want and eat the most delicious food you want. I was very happy that this was going to be fun.
