I still remember what it was like to wake up for the very first time. Not literally the first time I came to consciousness, but the first time I felt truly in-tune with my existence on this earth.  I recall the loud thumping in my chest, the burning hot sensation in my face, and the shining-white rings which danced in my blurred vision like pixies. Ironically, it’s all so clear to me even now.

Throughout my life, I’ve always worn a mask of sorts. It’s as though the “real me” is harshly wrapped with airtight plastic that’s stapled and sewn into my flesh with surgical precision. To put it bluntly, I am not who I say I am. To anyone. I have nothing in common with the person I share with the rest of the world. At this point, it’s honestly hard to tell which one is even the original.  	

But that day when I did *it*, I felt that facade crumble away almost instantly – like it was never there to begin with. My ears buzzed, butterflies rose up in my stomach, and it was as though I had become conscious of every sensation my body was presently experiencing all at once. I felt my slightly too-loose left shoe shift as my weight rested on it unevenly. I felt my overstuffed right pocket pressing against my leg. It bulged a few centimeters due to the extra protection I stuffed in there hurriedly. I can even recall the feeling of my shirt’s fabric pressed tightly against my chest under that baggy raincoat. I was so excited, I sweat right through my T-shirt, and it therefore clung to me for dear life. I recall the sensation of my body’s movement as I panted in sheer ecstasy. 

Most vivid of all was the hot trickle of that metallic-scented warmth as it flowed between each of my gloved fingers. I looked down, staring at it intently as I slowly clenched and unclenched my hands several times, wiggling my fingers and rubbing  them against my palm. It was darker than expected, but beautiful even still. It glistened so vibrantly in the otherwise harsh overhead lighting. 

In spite of an experience so remarkable, I can also keenly feel the tight curl of my wincing face at the time. Not from disgust or rejection of what covered my hands, but because this breath-taking moment was spoiled by a single chastising layer of self-protection. I understood at that point why so many men complained about wearing “rubber.” I thanked a god I didn’t believe in that the gloves were at least skin tight. 

Anything thicker and I’d have barely felt it at all. The idea of such a thing sickens me greatly. The most depressing part of the whole ordeal was when I had to crawl around on my hands and knees; scrubbing desperately with that bottle of cleaner and cheap roll of paper towels beside me. I had to wipe away every bit of my awakening, lest I face the consequences. 

The acrid fumes permeated throughout the enclosed space much to my dismay, searing my throat and lungs as I worked diligently to rid even the faintest bit of residue. I tried to hold my breath, but each inevitable gulp of air brought with it a twinge of fear for my long-term respiratory health. Next time, I’d bring a real mask to wear in lieu of my metaphorical one.

Only one thing kept me going at that time; I wouldn’t have a life for my lungs to suffer through had I not moved as deftly as possible. Because of my strong motivation, In just under 7 minutes I was able to remove all trace of either of us ever being in that bathroom. 

Exiting the house with a hurried step, the refreshing breeze washed against my face as I let out a sigh of immense relief. As bitter cold as it was, it felt like a godsend compared to the hot poison I was huffing just moments before. Just as I was closing shut the now-locked door behind me, I heard the low rumble of the old garage echoing throughout the house – signaling his wife’s early return home.  I was out with less than 30 seconds to spare. Any more time spent doing the deed, and it would have all been for nothing.

Slinging the black hefty bag over my shoulder, I was free to make my escape. More free than I’ve ever been before. Marching head first into the darkness which would guarantee my undetected departure, I glanced back only one time. Savoring the almost erotic image for a just moment, I knew then I’d always have the visual of that dark house embedded deep in my mind. The final snapshot of *my unforgettable first time.*
