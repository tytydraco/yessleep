Our Family, Has had Many... Supernatural Experiences, I personally haven't had many that can't be explained, but my sister has... 

It all started around 2012 to 2013, When we moved into our New House, I wasn't old enough to Remember. About 4 Years Old, But me and my Older siblings shared a Room for a While, We were in a 1 story House, Next to a Forest.

My Brother was first to move out of the Bedroom, She moved to the Otherside of the House

This is when things got weird, My sister always was scared of our house, Even now years later she still can't be without one of her pets in the house.

The Window Slides open, A long lengthy man, Shadows covered his face and body, So he was completely black, He held his briefcase and stood at the Bottom of the Bed, Almost hitting the roof and our roof is 7 Foot

It repeated & repeated for about a Year, My mother was seriously considering getting a Exorcist, To Banish them

The Man entered through the Window, And Crawled up towards my Sister, His briefcase in hand.

This time, He ignored my sister, And walked to my bed watching over me, My sister had a Complete Urge to Rush over and Stop him from going near me but Instead, she was so scared she pulled the sheets over her head.

Radio Silence, She slowly pulls them off, The man is Less then Three Inches from her, He knows she's looking at him, And he wanted to make his Presence Known.

Leaning over even closer, He whispers to her... she couldn't hear it, but she knew it wasn't good.

She Believed it walked to me, To show if she ever talks about him to her parents, He'll hurt me

Overtime, They all forgot besides my sister, The Man didn't come back as Much and eventually stopped coming back.

She had to sleep with the door open after that.

Weeks go by. Every Day, Our door creaks ever so slightly more closed, Eventually She goes to sleep and wakes up to the Creak of the Door closing, This time something Is sitting in the Corner, Small but emitting light, Almost like a flashlight

It's Hunch retracts realising she saw them, It slowly just fades away...

The Next Night The Bedroom's Wardrobe, A Weird Noise this one, Wasn't like the others, It had an Pungent Smell, This one gave my sister the need to run. An Exorcist comes by after we talked about it and after she told our mum about it she got a friend of our uncle to get the Exorcist.

The Exorcist entered.

" Oh, My... " He said, The Exorcists skin clearly had goosebumps

He almost walks straight out but stops, He does his thing and the Next day My Sister goes to sleep and has a perfect night of sleep, No More was the Man from the Window, Or the Light Emitting Man, Or The Wardrobe Creature.

So years go by, My sister moves out of my Room, Our brother moves out of the House, and Me and my friend are playing Hide & Seek Tag, With Walkie Talkies 

(My Dad had to work Long Range from others so he used Walkie talkies)

This was our outside round so we were playing outside

I had been hiding in our Garden. 

" Can I have a Hint? " He asked

I speak into my Walkie talkie and make random noises, Little did I know is he was less than a Two Meters away from me, And had already heard the noise of his voice

" Tag. " He said (lets call him Damien)

" Crap. " I said. 

We decided that was our last round because the sun was falling, and dusk was approaching.

We walk to the Patio.

My Sister and My brother (This was a Party thats why he's here) Welcomed us to eat.

" It's Sausages and Curry. " My brother stated

I groaned in response

About Fourteen Minutes later. I had "finished" my food, so we walked off and my mum asked my sister to watch over us.

She did, And So we walked slightly away and started playing Tag, My sister puts her makeshift Ring Costume on and We have to Run away from her.

But then She gets called in and we get to play with my Dads Phone.

We take a couple photos, Nothin' weird just selfies 

My Sister comes back and we show her them and ask her to take one of us.

She Immediately drops the Phone, Onto the grass so It didn't break but she said to us to go inside, and play in there

She told us that the photo didn't look wrong, but she could tell that the Wardrobe Spirit or Thing, Was there she went to sleep and thats when the Minor things began again. To the Point she ends up taking her dog in every night she has to sleep in there.

Rapid Knocks coming from her Wardrobe, Night Terrors, Etc

I get sick really badly, So I have to sleep with somebody watching me, But my parents were out at a Party, So I sleep in my sisters room, Half way through the Night I get horrible Night Terrors and then... 

I wake up, The Wardrobe is open, And two eyes peaking up staring blankly at me, I Lean closer thinking its a Pillow, and Then, The Pupils move, I immediately went under the sheets and closed my eyes for the first time in years

She moved Rooms but I ended up staying in our old room, But I started sleeping In another Room, Everytime I was in that room Rocks That only a human could throw got thrown up at my Room's Window... She only recently told me about the Man from the Window.

  
I'm worried that I've done something because now whenever shes in her bedroom, The Wardrobe knocks,
