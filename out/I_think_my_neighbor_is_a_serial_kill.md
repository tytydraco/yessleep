I’ve lived in the same quiet neighborhood for almost eight years now, and nothing much ever happens here. The loudest it gets is when kids are selling lemonade in the summer or when a car alarm goes off by accident. But lately, it feels like there’s something much darker creeping in through the cracks. My neighbor, Mr. Hanlon, an old man in his early sixties, has started to make me think he might not just be the lonely drunk he pretends to be.

From the outside, his house looks normal enough. Paint peeling from the shutters, a sagging roof, a lawn that hasn’t been trimmed since before COVID. But every night, without fail, I see the glow of his basement light flick on around midnight. Sometimes, I hear what sounds like power tools, or even muffled voices. The thing is, Mr. Hanlon lives alone. He never has visitors. No kids. No family. Nobody.

The man himself is strange too. He reeks of whiskey every time I see him, his hands trembling as he waves from across the street. He slurs his words, stares a little too long, and laughs at things that aren’t funny. A few times, I’ve caught him standing in his driveway at 3 a.m., just… staring up at my window. Not moving. Not blinking. Like he’s trying to memorize my face in the dark.

Two weeks ago, I noticed something that really set me on edge. Trash bags. Thick, black ones—stacked at the curb outside his house. They looked heavy, stuffed, and tied in a way that felt wrong. When the garbage truck came, Mr. Hanlon rushed outside, red-faced, yelling at the men to “be careful” with his bags. I don’t know about you, but who screams at garbage men over trash unless there’s something in there worth hiding?

That same night, I swear I heard screaming. It was faint, but it carried through the quiet streets like a thread pulled too tight. I called the cops. They showed up, knocked on his door, and fifteen minutes later, they left. One of the officers laughed with him on the porch before they drove off. I asked what happened. They told me he was just “watching old horror movies” a little too loud.

I would’ve let it go—except last Friday I caught him dragging something into his garage. Something large, wrapped in a stained sheet. His eyes flicked up and met mine when he realized I was watching. He didn’t look angry, though. He smiled. Slowly. Like he was daring me to say something. My stomach turned, and I shut the blinds.

Yesterday, curiosity got the better of me. While he was passed out drunk on his porch, I crept into his backyard. The stench hit me first—rotting meat mixed with bleach. I found a locked freezer humming in his shed, chains bolted around it. Nearby, a shovel leaned against the wall, caked in dirt. And buried in the garden, sticking just slightly out of the soil, was what looked like a human hand. Pale. Fingernails bitten down.

I nearly screamed but forced myself silent. I stumbled back toward my yard, heart hammering, when I noticed something carved into the wood of his shed. Letters. Names. My last name was there—scratched deep into the wood, over and over again.

The worst part? When I got home, shaking, I found an envelope taped to my front door. No address, no stamp, just my name. Inside, one single photo: me. Asleep. In my own bed.

And here’s the twist I can’t shake: the photo wasn’t taken from outside my window. It was taken from inside my house.
