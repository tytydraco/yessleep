Furbys are a quintessential late 90’s children’s toy. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE had one. They were beloved furry, pocket-sized little gremlins, and as a child I spent many hours “teaching” it English. Some time in my formative years I grew disinterested with my squat little furball and it ended up like most toys that I outgrew: stuffed away in a box under the basement stairs. Flash forward 20 or so years, and I am helping my parents clean out their house. They wanted to downsize and said that anything I found downstairs, I could keep. Most of it was junk accumulated over 40 years of home ownership, but there were a few keepsakes hidden away. I found a few neat Baltimore Orioles memorabilia pieces, some vintage board games, and some missing photo albums. Nestled in a box, near the back of the space under the stairs, was my old Furby. It was a tad dusty, but all things considered it looked good for its age. After dusting it off I could see its powder blue fur, bright yellow beak, and closed plastic eyes. I had no use for it and I doubted it worked after all these years, but something compelled me to take it. Nostalgia, I guess. I finished up decluttering, ferried the old junk to the donation center, packed my finds into my car, and headed home. I sorely regret bringing that little plastic demon into my home. 



It started off innocuous enough. I had placed the Furby on the top shelf of a book case in my basement. I came down the other day to find it sitting on the floor. I figured it had fallen over in the night and had landed right-side up. I put it back on the shelf and went on with my day. The next day I came down into the basement, only to find Furby sitting on the ground again. This time, it was further away from the book case. I rearranged the shelf so that Furby couldn’t fall. I found it on the floor again two days later. We engaged in this back-and-forth for about a week before I relented and let Furby stay on the floor. 



It wasn’t long after that I heard it speak. I just about jumped out of my skin when I heard “Who-bye” coming from my pitch-black basement. Furby was sitting on the carpet in its normal spot, eyes open. I could see its beak slowly moving as a distorted “Ay-tay” emanated from the speakers within. I checked its battery compartment and sure enough there were two corroded AA batteries. I trashed the batteries and did my best to clean the corrosion out. A few days later, it spoke again. Inside the battery compartment were two fresh batteries. I must have replaced the batteries and forgot. I removed the batteries again since Furbys are known to never shut up until they’re out of juice. Imagine my surprise when it speaks again. “Play”, “Play”, “Yumm-wah”. Man, even without batteries it wouldn’t stop talking. I eventually got annoyed enough to just throw Furby out. It was sad to see a childhood friend be relegated to the trash bin, but God damn was it getting on my nerves. 



That blue-furred fucker was back the next day. I found it in the kitchen, next to the oven. It was a little ragged-looking on account of it being in a trashcan. I threw it back in a bag and took the trash to the curb. It was back the next day, repeatedly saying “Ah-tah”. No clue what that meant, but I was getting tired of this little bastard showing back up in my house. I took it to the dump and yeeted it as far as I could into the refuse. 



It was back again the next day. I took a sledgehammer to it. The next day, it was back, all in one piece. “Ah-tah, Ah-tah”. It wouldn’t stop talking. Thrown in a box and buried? Attached to a firework and sent to the heavens? Set on fire? Next day you’d hear “Ah-tah, Ah-tah” coming from some random closet or room. I tried everything, and I couldn’t get rid of it. After many, many months of this, I gave up. I started letting it stay in the guest bedroom. That seemed to please the plastic imp, at least for about a month. Last week, I started finding eviscerated critters around my house. It started with a bisected mouse, then a vivisected chipmunk, and finally a decapitated rabbit. I knew Furby was the one behind this, but what was I supposed to do? I couldn’t get rid of it, and I had little desire to surrender my home to a toy.



I reached my breaking point today. I woke up to a searing pain in my foot. I looked down to see Furby sitting by my feet, chewing on a pinkish-red mass. That’s when I noticed the source of my agony. Furby, a plastic children’s toy, had chewed off two of my toes. “FEED, FEED, FEED” kept repeating from its beak. The once-cute eyes had been heavily damaged by my removal attempts, and now radiated a kind of malice. If I didn’t leave right then, I was going to become Furby food. The ER docs inquired into the source of my injuries, but I couldn’t say that a possessed toy ate them. I lied and said a lawnmower accident. After getting discharged, I grabbed a quick change of clothes and my laptop and checked into a hotel. I guess I need to sell my house. Any takers? It comes with a free Furby.
