I awoke to the dull thrumming sound of medical equipment, a stark contrast to the dreamless void that had consumed my last memory. My vision blurred and then focused on the stark whiteness of the hospital room. Flashes of pain tore through me as I tried to move. It was as if my body had been stitched together, but with the thread too tight, stretching the fabric of my skin to its limit.  
  
I caught a glimpse of myself in the small circular mirror mounted to the wall opposite my bed. What I saw almost made me wish for the comforting embrace of unconsciousness again. My face, or what was left of it, was a collage of scars, stitches, and contusions.  
  
A soft chime brought a nurse into my room. Her face masked with professional concern, she approached, clipboard in hand.  
  
"Mr. Mitchell?" she inquired softly, ensuring my consciousness wasn't a fleeting moment.  
  
"Yes?" I croaked, though I was uncertain. Was that my name? Mr. Mitchell?  
  
The nurse nodded. "You're awake. That's a good sign. You were in a car accident, a pretty severe one. Do you remember anything about it?"  
  
I struggled to pull memories from the haze, but there was nothing there. It was as if someone had taken an eraser to the chalkboard of my past.  
  
She seemed to read the confusion in my eyes. "Amnesia isn't uncommon with trauma like yours. It might come back in bits and pieces, or it might not come back at all."  
  
I tried to sit up, only to be overwhelmed by the pain radiating from every corner of my body. The nurse gently helped me recline.  
  
"Take it easy. You have multiple fractures, and your body's been through a lot. But your scars... they're not all from the accident," she said, hesitatingly, her eyes scanning the myriad of scars that latticed my chest and arms.  
  
"What do you mean?"  
  
She took a deep breath, visibly steeling herself. "It's as if... it's as if you've been... tortured, over and over."  
  
I stared at her, trying to process the weight of her words. My mind raced, trying to comprehend the implications. Why couldn't I remember?  
  
The days that followed were a blur of medical examinations and police interviews. They were eager to get a statement, to understand what had happened. But every time they tried, I came up empty.  
  
There was a detective, a grizzled man with a pockmarked face named Harris, who took particular interest in my case.  
  
"It's not just the accident," he'd whisper, sitting close enough that I could smell the tobacco on his breath. "It's what happened before that's puzzling. Who did this to you? And why?"  
  
But I had no answers.  
  
Late one night, as the hospital's corridors were bathed in the soft glow of emergency lighting, I was awoken by a strange sensation, as if someone was watching me. My heart raced, and the hair on my arms stood on end.  
  
In the shadowed corner of my room stood a figure, barely visible but unmistakably there. Their silhouette was obscured by darkness, but two glinting eyes stared back at me, filled with a malevolence that chilled me to the bone.  
  
Before I could react, the figure stepped closer, the dim light revealing a gaunt face, twisted with rage.  
  
"Do you remember me now?" the figure whispered, voice dripping with venom.  
  
I tried to scream, to call for help, but no sound emerged from my throat. I was paralyzed by fear.  
  
The figure leaned in, face inches from mine. "You might have forgotten, but I haven't. And now that you're awake, it's time to finish what we started."  
  
Just as suddenly as they had appeared, they retreated into the shadows and vanished. I was left gasping, drenched in cold sweat.  
  
Had it been a dream? A hallucination brought on by medication?  
  
But deep down, I knew the truth. Someone from my past, from the memories I couldn't access, was out there. And they were coming for me.  
  
The next morning, Detective Harris found me agitated and demanded to know what had happened. As I recounted the night's events, I saw his face turn an ashen shade of gray.  
  
"We need to get you out of here," he said urgently.  
  
But as the pieces began to fit together, I was left with an overwhelming dread. If I couldn’t remember my past, how could I face the nightmare that awaited me?  
  
The scars on my body were only the beginning. The real wounds were hidden within, and someone, somewhere, wanted to ensure they'd never heal.  


Detective Harris's urgency wasn't without reason. A hastily formed protective detail was organized around me. Every door, window, and entrance to my room was guarded. Yet, deep inside, I felt a nagging fear that it wouldn’t be enough.  
  
As dusk settled, bringing along the weight of the unknown, I found myself clutching the thin hospital blanket. Every creak of the floor, every rustle outside, felt like the footsteps of my unknown adversary.  
  
Then, sometime around midnight, the lights went out. The hum of the machines around me died, replaced by an eerie silence. A power outage, or something more sinister?  
  
Suddenly, the emergency backup lights bathed the hallway in a cold, blue hue, casting long, stretched shadows. It was in that very moment that I heard it — a slow, dragging sound, as if something heavy was being pulled across the floor.  
  
An ice-cold dread settled in my stomach. The sound was coming closer.  
  
Through the fogged glass of my room's door, I saw a darkened silhouette. It paused briefly, and then, with surprising force, began pounding on the door. The glass shook with every hit. I tried to scream, but once again, terror had stolen my voice.  
  
As the pounding continued, a revelation broke through the haze of my amnesia. A fragmented memory — a dilapidated warehouse, chains, and that same gaunt, rage-filled face — his name was Ethan.  
  
Ethan and I... we were partners, researchers working on cutting-edge neural technology. But our experiment had gone horribly wrong. Instead of enhancing human cognition, it brought out the darkest depths of the psyche. Ethan had become unstable, consumed by his own inner demons. I had tried to help him, but in the process, had become his prisoner.  
  
Back in the present, the door finally gave way. Ethan stepped in, dragging a heavy tool bag. His eyes, once full of intelligence and warmth, now shimmered with insanity.  
  
"You left me," he rasped, voice filled with pain and anger. "You tried to escape, leaving me to the darkness. But you can't run from your own mind."  
  
As he advanced, the memories flooded back, the torturous days in that warehouse, the experiments Ethan conducted to "free" us both from our past mistakes. He believed pain was the only way to salvation.  
  
I braced myself, ready for the inevitable. But then, a shot rang out. Ethan's expression shifted from rage to surprise. He staggered back, clutching his chest, and crumpled to the ground. Behind him stood Detective Harris, gun drawn and face pale.  
  
"Looks like I got here just in time," he muttered, breathing heavily.  
  
I nodded, too shaken to speak, as the weight of my memories pressed down on me. The ordeal was over, but the road to healing had only just begun.  
  
The following weeks were a blur of therapy sessions and police debriefings. I learned that after the failed experiment, Ethan had become obsessed with the idea of "fixing" us. He had staged the car accident, hoping it would wipe away my memories and give him a clean slate to start his torment anew.  
  
But as the days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, I found strength in facing my past head-on. The scars on my body would always be a reminder of the darkness I'd faced, but they also stood testament to my will to survive and move forward.  
  
Ethan's fate was a tragic one. A brilliant mind consumed by its own creation. But as I stood by the window of my new apartment, looking out at the bustling city, I felt a surge of hope. The past would always be a part of me, but it didn't define me. It was time to build a future, one day at a time.
