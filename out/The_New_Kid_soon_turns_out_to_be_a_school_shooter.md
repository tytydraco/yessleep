They always tell you to trust your instincts, that sinking feeling that warns you when something is wrong. But no one really expects it to be real. No one expects danger to look like a friendly, smiling face, like someone with a quiet charm and an easy laugh. No one expects it to look like Eric.

Eric transferred in around Thanksgiving. There was something strange about him right away, but it was subtle—almost too subtle. He had this calmness, like he already knew every single person at the school inside and out. It was like he’d been watching us long before he actually arrived.

At first, I didn’t really talk to him. But one day he sat next to me in history class, turning his full attention on me, a quiet smile on his lips. “Hey, do you need any help with the notes?” he asked. His voice was smooth, almost soothing, and something in his gaze told me he already knew my answer. I nodded, trying to ignore the way his stare made me feel like he could see right through me.

The next day, he handed me an entire semester’s worth of notes. Not just scribbles, either—perfectly organized, color-coded, diagrams, and all. My friends were amazed, and Haley even asked if he could do the same for her. By lunchtime, he’d handed her another notebook just like mine, filled with a year’s worth of detailed notes, like he’d been keeping them for months.

Haley thought it was nice. I thought it was terrifying.

A few days later, I started finding things in my locker. At first, it was small things—little trinkets like pens or bracelets, things you’d think someone found on the floor and thought you might like. But then they started getting… disturbing.

One day, I found a small, blood-stained feather carefully tucked into a piece of paper that said, “They can’t fly anymore.” I nearly dropped it on the spot, my hands shaking as I quickly shoved it to the bottom of my bag, not wanting anyone else to see. But I couldn’t ignore it.

Eric was always close by. In every class, I’d catch him watching me from the corner of his eye, a slight smirk on his lips, as if he knew exactly what I was thinking. And he did the same with Haley. Whenever we’d walk to the cafeteria, he’d fall into step right behind us, just close enough that we could hear his breathing. But every time we’d turn around, he’d just flash us that charming smile, like he was innocent.

That’s when Haley got the dead bird.

She opened her locker one morning, screamed, and jumped back, nearly falling to the floor. Inside, on a small, folded napkin, was a dead sparrow, its neck twisted, blood dripping down from its beak. There was another note, this time scrawled in barely legible handwriting, “They’ll never know who did it, just like last time.”

She threw it away, but I saw her hands were still shaking all day. I asked her if she thought it was Eric, and she hesitated, but then shrugged. “I mean… it’s creepy, but it doesn’t have to be him. There are weird kids here, you know?” But I could see the fear in her eyes.

After that, I started seeing him everywhere. Not just at school but around my neighborhood too. I’d walk home, and out of the corner of my eye, I’d see him a block behind me, just standing there, hands in his pockets, staring. Once, I even found him outside my house, leaning against the tree in our front yard. When I opened the door to confront him, he just waved and walked away.

My mom didn’t believe me when I told her about it. “You’re probably just seeing someone who looks like him,” she said, not even glancing up from her phone. I stopped bringing it up after that, realizing I was on my own.

Then, two weeks before Christmas break, I found another note in my locker. This one was different—stained with what looked like blood, the words scrawled so hard they’d torn through the paper. “Did you like the bird?” it read. “I think I’ll find you a bigger one next time.”

I didn’t go to school for a week after that. I didn’t want to see him, to feel his eyes boring into me, that smile that made my skin crawl. But when I came back, he acted like nothing had happened. He even asked me if I’d been sick, flashing me that too-perfect grin. “I hope you’re feeling better,” he’d said, leaning a little too close, his breath cold against my skin.

When the lockdown drills started happening, I thought it was just a coincidence. But Eric’s expression during those drills? He looked like he was thrilled. Every time the teacher would dim the lights and tell us to huddle in the corner, he’d sit with a weird, hungry look on his face, staring at the door as if he were imagining something far worse than just a drill.

One day, in the middle of a drill, he reached into his backpack and pulled out a small, torn piece of paper. He folded it into a little square and slid it across the floor to me, his eyes locked on mine. I opened it with trembling hands, reading the words scrawled inside:

“I’ve done this before.”

That night, I was desperate. I’d heard rumors, whispers from other students that he’d left his old school because of something bad, something people didn’t like to talk about. So I searched his name online, scouring every article and forum I could find. That’s when I found the news report.

“School Shooting Leaves Six Dead.”

I clicked on it, my heart in my throat. The article was from two years ago, from a school near Eric’s hometown. No names were mentioned, but the description fit him to a T—a quiet, seemingly “charming” student who’d transferred to the school just months before the tragedy. The case had gone cold, no leads, no suspects. But I knew. I knew it was him.

I tried to tell Haley, but she waved it off. “You’re just letting him get to you. He’s creepy, yeah, but he wouldn’t actually do anything.” But I could tell she was scared, too.

A week later, it happened.

It was just after lunch, and we were filing into the hallways when the intercom crackled on. “This is a lockdown. This is not a drill. Students, please remain in your classrooms and lock your doors.”

We all froze. My heart was pounding so loud I thought everyone could hear it. As I glanced around, I realized that Eric wasn’t in class. He’d disappeared during lunch, and no one had seen him come back.

That’s when we heard the first shot.

It echoed down the hallway, followed by screams. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t move. Everyone scrambled toward the corner, trying to hide, clutching each other in terrified silence. And then… I heard footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing closer.

Another shot rang out, closer this time. And I knew, somehow, that he was coming for us. Just as the door rattled and we held our breaths, he laughed. It was a quiet, unnerving sound that sent chills down my spine.

“We’ll finish later,” he said, almost to himself. Then his footsteps retreated, and the door was still.

It felt like hours before the police came, before they pulled us out, one by one, telling us the worst was over. But it wasn’t, not really. Because even as I walked away from that school, I knew he was still out there. And he’d made a promise that day, with every glance, every note, every dead creature left in my locker.

The police searched for him, but they never found him.
