Marty was my father. He was a big Frank Zappa fan and when he found out that Zappa's kids called their father, "Frank," instead of, "Dad," well, old Marty thought it sounded to be a pretty good idea. A real epiphany, like how Marty grew his hair long and picked up all that groovy hippie hand-jive just as it was becoming a thing. That, and an ounce a week weed habit.

I really wouldn't of cared about what kind of derelict Marty was if my Mom hadn't disappeared when I was six. She was Romanian and had escaped from behind the iron curtain with an Aunt in the late 1940s. I remembered she was always laughing and smelled like lilacs and sunshine.

And then one day she told me she had to go away. That she did not know when she would be able to see me again. Then she gave me a little jade stone and told me that if I hold it real tight and think of her she'd know.

Six year old me had no idea what she was on about, only that I was about to be stranded with Phineas Freak in a splintery bachelor pad that smelled like weed and takeout cartons and body odor. I started to cry. I thought I was going to get a hug but then the hand came. Fast. Furious. A stinging rebuke.

"You will understand when you're grown up. But until then the first thing to do is never cry."

I cried harder.

Slap.

More tears.

Slap happy me.

Then I began to convulse with the crybabies and Mom's face grew furious before a curious thing happened. At first it tilted as if to get a better look. Then it softened.

"Okay, my little Tigran. Perhaps you are right to cry like a little wimp. I wish you luck with that. Your father cried when he discovered that little bald spot on the top of his head."

And then she was gone.

I wanna say Marty stepped up to the plate, but just, no. Marty hooked up with another hippie chick, Marlene. Marlene had a harelip and only ate frozen Hostess dessert products. Didn't matter what. So long as it was frozen. Yodels. Ring Dings. Ho-Hos. Funny Bones. Twinkies. Chocodiles.

That was the solid food. Beverage was always the same. Vanilla egg creams. For those of you that don't know the egg cream. It's an old New York City, twentieth century artifact, this egg cream thing.

*A vanilla egg cream is a cold beverage made with milk, seltzer water, and vanilla syrup, creating a frothy drink with a vanilla flavor; despite the name, it contains neither eggs nor cream, and is essentially a variation of the classic "egg cream" where the chocolate syrup is replaced with vanilla syrup.* 

Oh, and LSD. Marlene loved tripping. Tripping and playing with Marty's bald spot.

And while Marty was self-conscious about his bald spot and didn't like it played with he did like tripping. And I actually didn't mind when he was on acid. Anything could happen.

In fact, one night Marty decided we needed to go to the comic book store to see if the comic books looked 3-D. I remember it cause Marty's bald spot was extra shiny due to the egg white and urine concoction Marlene kept rubbing into the spot.

8 year old me didn't really know what tripping was, but 3-D sounded bad ass, and comic books; fuhgeddaboutit.

Anyway, we left old Marlene sprawled out on the bear skin rug, tripping to The Beatles' Revolution No. 9.

"Bring me back a Cosmo and Vogue, Marty! And don't let Tigran get more than one comic book."

I wanted to say something but I hated that fucking song. And I could always persuade Marty to get a whole fucking stack of comics. Especially when he was stoned. Which was like always. So imagine our surprise to arrive back at the bachelor pad with a half-gallon of Breyer's Chocolate Chip Mint ice cream and the latest Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Plop, House of Secrets, Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man and X-Men issues and find something missing.

What was missing was the red brick four story building where Marty and now Marty, Marlene and I lived. Only now where the building stood was but a carcass. The burnt out remains of a poorly maintained roach infested Midwood $120 a month 2 bedroom. Only all you could see was what was left of the basement and rubble. So much rubble, if you looked down at your Chuck Connors, it coulda been 1945 Berlin.

But it was 1973 Brooklyn. Turned out old Marlene was cold and had turned on the stove. Only Marty had been too high to remember to tell Marlene the pilot was out. So old Marlene let that stove go to, "Broil," like she always did in the winter. And then, she flicked her Bic to have a smoke and a pancake and the next thing you know the roof is on fire and before anybody could let the motherfucker burn it blew sky high.

I thought Marty would be all busted up once the Fire Department explained how Marlene exploded the apartment building. He seemed oddly serene. Almost beatific.

Back in his bug Marty ruffled my head. It was odd cause Marty didn't do displays of affection. Later that year we moved into another building. Time passed. Marty's bald spot got bigger and he took to the artful combover.

And, once again, Marty hooked up with another hippie chick, Siobhan, he picked up hitchhiking in Brooklyn. I knew it would suck barf chunks because nobody hitchhiked inside New York City but the mentally defective.

And whaddya know? Siobhan smoked, tripped and couldn't work a stove right on a cold winter's day. And whaddya know? We just happened to be out when the building went ***kaboomski***. And then we moved to an even nicer crib. This time on the upper east side of Manhattan near Central Park.

Marty met one of those fancy society women. And soon there was talk about some genetic breakthrough at her brother's company that was going public. A cure for baldness. Genetic engineering. Truly groundbreaking stuff. They were going to clone Marty's follicles like Dolly the sheep.

Couple of months went by and Marty checked his bald spot every night in the big vanity. This was usually followed by a tirade of expletives and Siobhan would attempt to calm Marty. That only made Marty angrier. As the weeks bled into months Marty became almost impossible to live with; even in a four bedroom apartment.

I was about ready to join the Moonies and run away when I heard a scream and a crash. I ran down the long hall and looked in the bathroom mirror. Marty was jumping for joy.

**"HAIR! HAIR! THE SUNSHINE! HAIRRRRRR! THE SUNSHINE!!!! THE SUN SHINE IN!!!!!"**

Before my very eyes, in a very snakes and ladders shimmer, were new fine baby hairs sprouting. Like play-do.

Marty screamed for Siobhan. Her brother came over. Marty was the first candidate to show positive results and we are talking hair today and more hair tomorrow.

So much more so that within a week old Marty took to carrying a battery powered electric razor with him wherever he went.

I got so used to the constant drone of the razor. One day, exasperated Siobhan snapped, "Can you stop shaving your head for a fucking minute, Mart?"

He tried. And then for another. But, like popcorn, you could actually hear those follicles popping.

"You better call your brother. My skin feels weird."

And then the popping lost top billing to the snapping and crackling.

Marty was a fucking hair growing machine. And not just his head anymore. Eyebrows, ear hair, nose hair, chest hair, arms, back, pubes, belly, thighs and even his fingers got gnarly with a coarse wiry hair that could pop a balloon.

In the end, Marty had to have whole body electrolysis and skin grafts from the third world before the hirsute horror that had become his life ceased.

And then, hairless as a baby Marty met the love of his life. A very large woman from East Germany named Gwen Stacy.

We left the city for the country and for the first time I found myself living on acres and acres of land. Far as the eye could see. And there were horses. And goats. And unwashed hippies. And, about a year later it burned down with my new step-mother, Gwen-Stacy, in it. And then, *baldy* and I were back in the city.

I remember that winter asking Marty if I could go on a ski trip with the whole class at my new school when the doorbell rang. Marty did a final toot from the mirror and walked down the long parquet floored hall to the front door. I  continue watching MTV.

I heard a commotion but the hallway was so long.

"Son?"

I whipped my head around. Marty always called me Tigran.

My jaw dropped. I felt a sinking in the pit of my stomach but it was nothing compared to the hole the wooden stake in Marty's chest was going to leave.

"Son?"

Marty looked down at the stake protruding from his chest. There was a lot of blood already.

Marty opened his hand. And there, in the palm, was a small and oblong jade stone.

It fell from his palm to the white and red with blood spattered bone white shag rug. Marty followed suit falling like ash from a neglected cigarette.

And then I felt a chill, and from nowhere and everywhere I heard a voice whisper, "Don't cry! Ever!"

I don't really think about this stuff anymore as it's over forty years in the rearview mirror. Except an envelope came today. Inside was a small jade stone and a book of matches advertising some ambulance chasing law firm. Inside the matchbook cover someone wrote, "Sonny boy!"
