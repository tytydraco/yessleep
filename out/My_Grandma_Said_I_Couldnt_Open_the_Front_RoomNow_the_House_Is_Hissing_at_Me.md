I knew something was off the moment I got to my grandma’s house and the front porch smelled like old wood, vinegar, and something trying to be lavender. She hugged me tight, said “Baby, I’m so glad you’re here,” then immediately followed it with:

“Don’t open the front room. Don’t touch the bells. And if the house starts hissing, just go outside and let it finish.”

I laughed. She didn’t.

So now I’m here. In Alabama. In a house older than sin with no central AC, a fridge that moans like it’s haunted by lunch meat, and slave quarters hiding behind the tree line like they owe back taxes.

It’s giving: haunted Southern gothic with a dash of generational trauma.

Night one, I’m laying in bed sweating through my *Target sheets brought from the city*, and I hear it. A low, *sssshhhhhhhhhh*, like steam from a pot that ain’t on. I sit up. The sound stops.

I swear the damn house is waiting.

The next morning I ask about the hissing. My grandma, mid-sip of sweet tea like she’s auditioning for a community theater production of *Steel Magnolias*, goes:

“Did you open the front room?”

“No?”

She just hums and mutters something about “the line holding strong.” Ma’am. *What line.*

Now here’s where it gets weird.

I opened the front room.

I *know*, I know. But I’m curious and slightly disrespectful, okay? The door creaked open like it was mad at me, and inside… it was cold. Like, *unnaturally* cold. One room in the whole house with working ghosts-for-vents.

There’s a painting on the wall of a stern white man in a plantation coat with a Bible in one hand and a cane in the other. Next to him, a little girl. Maybe five. Black. Light-skinned. Eyes like glacier water. Something about her looked familiar.

It hit me later when I saw the photo on the mantle in the living room. My great-grandmother Ruth.

Same eyes.

That night, the hissing came back louder. And I swear, I heard chains. Not like dragging-on-the-ground chains. *Shaking*. Like something *angry* and rattling the past.

Grandma came into my room at 3:00 a.m., looking calm as ever, in her satin bonnet and slippers.

“You let air in. Now it knows you're here.”

“I’m sorry—*what* knows I’m here?”

She sat on the edge of my bed like this was a casual Tuesday and said, “Your great-grandmother was the daughter of the man who built this house. She wasn’t supposed to exist. So when she did… he tried to lock the spirit away. In that room. But Ruth was the only one who could hold it back.”

“And now?”

“You’re the only one left with her eyes.”

I swear on my Wi-Fi bill, I have *never* wanted to not be special more in my life.

So now, I’m apparently the family seal, the chosen trauma sponge. I’m not allowed to leave the house for more than three days without something “leaking.” I have to say a blessing every Thursday at sundown and keep *cornbread* in the kitchen window “to keep it fed.”

Not even joking. Ghosts out here snacking.

And if you're wondering why we don't just sell the land? Ha. Zillow won't touch it. People come to view it and end up crying blood or seeing their ancestors whispering “turn back.” One guy vomited feathers. I don’t even ask anymore.

Anyway, I just heard the hissing again. Grandma’s already on the porch. I guess it’s my turn.

If I don’t update, the house finally got me. If I do update... someone send cornbread. Please.
