I saw the end of the world. Well, not exactly, you see, this all happened on a normal school day. I was a highschool student sitting in my first period class chatting with one of my close friends.

 Then, it happened, everyone was gone, at first I thought I was just dreaming so I pinched myself. But no, I was awake, I rushed to the bathroom and looked in the mirror to see if something was off.

 No, everything was… normal? I flew down the school stairs and rushed outside to hear nothing. I screamed to try to alert anyone or anything around me and I got no response.

 I finally got the idea to check my phone, I scrolled through my notifications and had no recent messages. I tried calling my mom and dad but no one picked up, I tried every single contact and even tried the police but the line went dead immediately.

 After a while of my panic I began to explore, looking around for any sign of life and for a while I started to enjoy things. I went to big mansions and ate all the food I wanted too, I drove fast cars nearly killing myself sometimes since I didn't really know how to drive. But strange things occurred while I explored, first was animals and bugs were still here, factories ran without any humans maintaining them, airplanes seemingly floated in the air without moving and it was always cloudy, no rain or snow.

 But I pushed these doubts and worries away as I just enjoyed having everything, but after a while I got bored, another weird thing was Wi-Fi worked but there were only old videos which gave me some entertainment but it ran out pretty quickly.

 Since there was Wi-Fi games did also work but most games nowadays are most enjoyable with a friend or just someone else to play with so that ended pretty quickly. Years passed as I walked the earth trying to find anyone, someone, I celebrated birthdays by myself and had my own parties, with nobody to share it with.

 Eventually suicide thoughts came rolling in, I could go anywhere, eat anything, do anything, but I had no one to do it with.

 After 5 years of being alone I was ready to end it all, I went back to where it began, my school, I climbed those treacherous stairs and found a way to the rooftop which I never knew we had. I got to the very edge and reminisced on everything I did, everything I saw, and then, I jumped, but as I jumped the world sort of stopped, and all of a sudden I felt sick to my stomach as I began to sort of “rewind”, to better understand this think of pressing rewind on a movie and you things go back. 

That was how it was for me, everything that I did was played back as I fell backwards in time, I couldn't stop this process until I ended up back in school. Here we go again.
