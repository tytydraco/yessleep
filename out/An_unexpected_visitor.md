It's happening so slow, I don't know what to do, my heart is pounding I'm being watched. 
Throwback to around 6 months earlier, me and my friend, we were walking to my house when we saw a man looking at the sky, it was around 8pm and it was dark. We didn't think much of him we just went past him, but he never moved just like he was hypnotised. He stood there for a good while but he never moved at least i remeber it like that.
Now im sitting on my bed and he's watching my window. He is tall and skinny, i live near a big graveyard and I've experienced a lot of "dark masses"? Like these normal in church every sunday but these sounded... weird... 
Now back to that guy, i thought that he was baiting and his friend is looting my home but nothing downstairs. As i came back to my room, HE IS GONE.

On the videos I don't see anything but after some filters... Well i do seem to see something. Please let there be a chance for me to update this...

Somebody just took off with a great speed, it could be our local roadman type hooligans, it's Poland... For example in Cracow they run with machetes, here you can get stabbed in a assassin's Creed style.
He dissapearded and i can't see the road near my house, my father is out of the country driving trucks. My mother is asleep and i have my arm in a denture. I have a dog that is higher than 1.8m when standing on his hind legs but ffs i can't do anything.

I live near cementery, might that be somebody who got possessed? He was standing perfectly in line to me. Near my neighbors fence perfectly staring into my room.
He couldn't be sleep walking right? I couldn't see his face, in fact i never did. The hell, i never saw his face now I know, i never did. I didn't saw his face 6 months ago neither did I today. Maybe IT didn't have a face? How come it took me as it's target? Why, why me?

It didn't have a face, video and pictures of poor quality. Never got a good look of him. What could it be? Maybe a skinwalker? No, no it couldn't be, i could be dead by now. Where did he go, where?!

As of 2:21 am, he is not there. Heard a lot of weird stuff, i don't have a cross in my room or any other crucifix.
All that stress, everything makes me tired and dizzy, i can't think straight nor i can go to sleep... Heh sleep I think it's the last thing I need for now. Maybe I'll be alive in the morning, maybe possessed like that thing, who knows there will be an update or will not be. I could send these videos on dms, but please help me identify what that could be, it couldn't be a skinwalker, could be?

Wait, why is my dog so quiet?
