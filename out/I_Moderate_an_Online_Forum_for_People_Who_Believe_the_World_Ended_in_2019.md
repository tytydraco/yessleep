For the last two years, I’ve been the sole moderator for an online forum called "Echo Chamber 2019." The pay is decent, the hours are flexible, and the work is, for the most part, mind-numbingly simple. The forum’s premise is that the world—our world—didn’t make it past 2019. According to the community, we’re living in a copy, an echo, or a simulation that’s slowly degrading. My job was to keep the peace among the believers, filter out the obvious trolls, and generally maintain a digital asylum for what I considered a group of harmless eccentrics coping with a shared, elaborate delusion.

The content was usually what you’d expect. Users would log what they called "artifacts" or "rendering errors"—small inconsistencies in the world that they believed were proof of the simulation's decay. It was all very creative, and for a long time, I treated the place like a collaborative fiction project.

Here are a few typical examples from the early days:

Subject: Color Palette Update?

Has anyone else noticed the sky? For the last three months, the daytime blue has been... off. It's less saturated. I checked my old vacation photos from 2018 and it's a completely different hue. It’s like they pushed a system-wide graphics update and hoped no one would notice.

Subject: The Lost Episode

I need a sanity check. I have a vivid memory of watching the series finale of Parallax in the summer of 2019. I remember the main character, Elias, sacrificing himself. I talked about it with my coworkers for a week. Now, I look it up, and the show was cancelled after one season in 2017. The finale I remember doesn't exist. It never existed.

The community had a peculiar set of rules, which I enforced with a kind of detached amusement. I saw them as role-playing mechanics, designed to deepen the immersion of their grand narrative.

* Rule 3: Do not attempt to contact members outside the forum. All communication must remain on-platform.
* Rule 5: All ‘glitches’ must be logged with date, time, and precise geographical location. Vague entries will be removed.
* Rule 7: Do not attempt to photograph, record, or otherwise capture direct evidence of anomalous entities. Describe them from memory only.
* Rule 9: Never speak their names aloud. Use designated codenames only.

I took the job for the easy money and a bit of sociological curiosity. I was a neutral observer, a janitor sweeping up the digital dust of their fantasies. I lived in my world, the real world, and they lived in theirs. The line was clear and absolute. At least, it was, until I read Post ID 7g4-b9k.

The First Glitch: Post ID 7g4-b9k

It was a Tuesday afternoon, and I was wading through the usual queue of pending posts with a cup of coffee. Most were easily dismissed—reports of deja vu, dreams that felt too real, the usual. But one post, from a user named 'Witness_Zero', was different. It wasn't hysterical or vague. It was cold, precise, and utterly terrifying in its coherence.

Subject: VERIFICATION NEEDED: The Old Town Clocktower

Date: 10/14/2021 Time: 14:30 PST Location: Oakhaven, Oregon

I need someone else to see this. The clocktower in my town's square has four faces. It has always had four faces. I have lived here my entire life. I looked at it on my way to lunch today. It now has three. There is just smooth, uninterrupted brickwork where the west-facing clock face should be. There is no sign of construction. No dust, no scaffolding, no news reports. I asked three people walking by what they thought of the change, and they looked at me like I was insane. They all said, "It's always been like that." I am losing my mind. Please, if anyone is near Oakhaven, go to the town square. Tell me I am not the only one who remembers.

My first reaction was a sigh. A classic case of false memory. I opened a new tab to find a quick photo of the Oakhaven clocktower to post in the comments and lock the thread. I searched for images. Every single photo, from professional shots on the town’s tourism page to recent tourist photos on Instagram, showed a three-faced clocktower. The west-facing side was just seamless, old brick.

Then, my professional cynicism gave way to a prickle of unease. I dug deeper. I used a satellite map service with a historical imagery feature. I dragged the timeline back. 2020… three faces. 2019… three faces. Then I hit July 2018. The satellite image was lower resolution, but it was undeniable. Four faces. I clicked forward one month to August 2018. Three faces. The change was there, in the data, but with no corresponding real-world event. No demolition permits, no news articles about a renovation, no blog posts. It had simply… changed.

On the forum, the post exploded. A few other users claimed to remember the four-faced tower from old family trips. Then, 'Witness_Zero' posted one last, frantic comment: "It knows I saw. Something is outside my house. It's just standing there. It doesn't have a f—" The post cut off. A few minutes later, their account was deleted. User Not Found. I realized later he'd broken Rule 7. He wasn't describing from memory; he was looking right at it. That was his mistake.

I told myself they probably just panicked and deleted their profile. But for the first time, I felt a genuine chill. That online anomaly was the first crack in the wall separating their world from mine. Soon, I’d start seeing the cracks in my own.

The Cracks in My Reality: When the Rules Came Offline

The forum was no longer a game. After the 'Witness_Zero' incident, I started reading the posts not as a moderator, but as a student. The detached amusement was gone, replaced by a low, humming paranoia. I found myself looking for inconsistencies everywhere—the pattern of the tiles on my bathroom floor, the number of steps to my apartment, the exact phrasing of a commercial jingle. The world had become a puzzle, and I was terrified of what I might find.

My first, undeniable glitch happened a week later. I was on the phone with my sister, talking about our childhood dog, Buster. "I'll never forget the day we got him," she said, laughing. "You cried because you were so happy, and Dad tripped over the redacted on the way in."

The word she used wasn't just strange; it was impossible. It sounded like a burst of radio static, a garbled piece of data that had no place in human speech. My blood ran cold.

"The what?" I asked, my voice tight.

"The leash," she said, sounding confused. "He tripped over the leash. Are you okay?"

I frantically searched the Echo Chamber archives. I typed "garbled speech," "static words," "corrupted audio." I found it. Dozens of posts. They had a codename for it: "The Misplaced." A rare audio glitch where a piece of the world's source code momentarily bleeds through. Users described it happening during conversations with loved ones, on TV broadcasts, in overheard conversations on the street. It was a known phenomenon. My personal, private moment of terror was just a data point in their horrifying catalog.

The second anomaly was worse. I was walking home from the grocery store, late in the evening. A man walked past me under a flickering streetlight. For a single, horrifying instant—as the light strobed—his face wasn't a face. It was a blur, a pixelated smear of flesh-toned colors, like a low-resolution texture that hadn't loaded properly. I froze, my grocery bag slipping from my hand. The light flickered again, and he was just a normal man. But as he passed, his expression wasn’t one of confusion. It was a look of profound, cold disappointment, as if he was annoyed I had noticed him at all.

My sanity, once a solid foundation, was now a web of fractures. I went home and read the forum rules again. "Rule 7: Do not attempt to photograph, record, or otherwise capture direct evidence of anomalous entities." "Rule 9: Never speak their names aloud." These weren't for a game. They were survival instructions. And I was beginning to realize I was no longer a moderator in a game; I was a player who didn’t know how to win.

The Unspoken Truth: I Am No Longer a Moderator

I don't moderate the forum anymore. I participate. My duties are no longer about enforcing guidelines; they are about cross-referencing logs, searching for patterns, and trying to understand the new mechanics of a world that is fundamentally broken. I am a survivor, just like them.

From the fragmented, terrified accounts of the forum's most trusted members, I've pieced together what seems to be the unspoken truth. The world didn't end in fire and brimstone. It just… stopped. And something else started. This reality we're in is a bad copy, running on failing hardware. The glitches aren't supernatural; they're system errors. The strange things people see aren't invaders from another dimension. They're native to this one. They are the bugs in the code, the system daemons, the things that exist in the rounding errors of reality.

And the rules are not for our protection. They are to keep us from being noticed by the system's automated cleanup crew.

* Rule 3: Do not attempt to contact members outside the forum.
  * What we think it means is: Contacting another person who is "awake" creates a node. It establishes a connection that the system can trace. Small, isolated instances of awareness are tolerated as random error. A network of aware individuals is a threat that must be purged.
* Rule 7: Do not acknowledge the 'Flicker Men'.
  * The terrifying consensus is that: I think I know what I saw under that streetlight. The others call them 'Flicker Men' or 'Un-rendered'. They are background processes, NPCs that haven't loaded correctly. They are not meant to be seen. Acknowledging them—staring, showing fear, speaking to them—flags your own code for review. They are the sentinels, and they feed on observation. They will slowly un-write you from reality.
* Rule 9: Never speak their names aloud.
  * What we’ve pieced together is: Certain concepts, certain truths about the nature of this broken world, function like root commands. Speaking them aloud is like typing 'delete' into the command prompt of reality. It draws immediate, catastrophic attention.

I saw it happen. A user named 'Logician' started a private chat with me. He believed he had found a way to exploit the glitches. He broke Rule 3, trying to organize a few of us. He broke Rule 7, attempting to study an anomaly too closely. Then he broke Rule 9, telling me in a voice message the "true name" of the system itself. His posts became incoherent strings of text and numbers. Then they stopped. The next day, I looked for his user profile. It was gone. Not just deleted, but as if it had never been there. Out of a terrifying hunch, I searched his name on social media. His profiles were gone. Public records returned no results. He had been scrubbed. He wasn't just dead. He was deleted.

I am writing this because last night, I made a mistake. I broke a rule. And I know what is coming for me.

They're Here: My Final Log Entry

I broke Rule 7. I saw one again, on my street, standing across from my apartment building. A Flicker Man. This time I didn't just glance. I stared. I was tired, I was angry, and I wanted to understand. For about ten seconds, I held its non-gaze, trying to resolve the blur where its face should be. It turned its head towards me. And I felt a click deep in my mind. The feeling of being seen. The feeling of a file being marked for deletion.

The signs started an hour ago. There's a high-frequency hum in my apartment that my neighbor can't hear. The corner of my vision has a persistent blur, like a smudge on a camera lens that moves when I try to look at it. The faces of the people in the photos on my wall are wrong. The smiles are too wide, the eyes are too dark. My own reflection looks like a stranger.

I'm writing this now because the forum was the only guide I had, and this is the only way I know how to pass on the warning. As I type, the words on my screen keep auto-formatting against my will, snapping into the rigid structure of a forum log entry. The static isn't just a sound, it's a feeling. Deleting temp files. I can feel the memories going first. My mother's face. The taste of coffee. This post is all that's left of me. User ID M_Blackwood is being scrubbed. Remember Oakhaven. Remember the clock. Remem—
