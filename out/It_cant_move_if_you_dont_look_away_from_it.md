'After being resuscitated, a woman, is now stalked by a terrifying creature that appears to be getting closer, and can only move if you look away from it'. 


It began twelve weeks ago.  The night Scott, my childhood sweetheart and husband of five-years confessed that he’d had a drunken one-night stand on his bachelor party in Europe.  The apparent guilt had consumed him for the past five-years, and his sudden urge to be truthful was due to the fact we were due to get married this same year. 

His words hit me like a freight train, and the urge to vomit washed over me like a tsunami.  I stormed out of the house, our house that we’d bought together twelve-years prior.  I felt like the world had swallowed me whole, and in a way, it had. 

I was struck with a throbbing chest pain that rapidly spread down my entire right side.  The pain intensified, taking my breath away, and I stumbled into a tree to steady myself as I felt my body about to faint.

Then darkness.

The next thing I remember, was waking up in a dark and dismal forest, devoid of colour.  The air was dry and had a distinctive, malodorous smell, like rotten meat or that of a decaying carcass.  But worst of all, was a terrifying feeling that I’d never experienced before, and one that I pray I’ll never feel again.

The feeling of absolute hopelessness. 

The sky was dull and cloudless, and was ripped apart by soundless, ferocious lightning that illuminated the bleak landscape I found myself in.  I felt like I’d been wandering for hours, maybe even days when I came across a decaying cave.  Animal bones crushed beneath my feet as I made my way towards it. 

As I approached the cave, the putrid smell grew with intensity causing me to retch, and I was violently sick, bringing up my own stomach bile.  The entrance was made of crumbling stone and was completely opaque.  I threw a small stone into it and heard it ricocheting down the stone steps and off the walls.  The silenced lighting strobed the area, and I was able to glimpse into the cave and see a few descending steps.  

Then, two yellow reptilian-like eyes flashed in the darkness. 

I stumbled backwards, and just as the lightning struck, I was forcefully thrown by an unseen force.  The lighting flashed continuously, accompanied by a gale-force wind, tossing me around like a rag doll. My eyes remained fixed on the cave, and I crippled in terror, as a pale, gangly hand reached around the crumbling stone.  Another flash hurled me hard against a tree, and suddenly -

I woke up in the back of an ambulance with paramedics hovering over me with a defibrillator, and two words that sent a cold and grotesque shiver through my spine. 

“Welcome back”. 

Welcome back?  Back from where?  What was that place?  That thing in the cave?  How long was I gone?  

Hundreds of questions raced through my mind, but none of which I had the answer for.  Not yet anyway. 

“You died in the back of that ambulance” the doctor said as I lay in a bed in the ICU. 

The room tilted as I tried to digest what the doctor was telling me.  I felt like I was in a nightmare that I couldn’t wake up from.  I’m thirty-years old, I eat healthily, and I run four times a week, how could this be happening to me?

My scans revealed I’d inherited a faulty gene and developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and suffered a cardiac arrest.  I spent the next seven-weeks in the ICU and told nobody of the dark forest and the creature with the yellow eyes.  Just the thought of that place was enough to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. 

My mother practically moved into the hospital.  Fussing over me like mothers do.  She blamed herself for my condition, even though her scans were clear, meaning that I inherited the faulty gene from my absent father.  

My husband Scott came on the first day, but I asked him for space.  I needed some time to heal and process everything that had happened, about both my condition, and his infidelity.  Although he kept that promise, he would call my mom every day to check on me, to make sure I was okay.

I wasn’t.
      
Not because of my condition, but for something else. 

I’d started to see something. 

I wasn’t sure what it was at first.  It started as a tiny dot in my peripheral, nothing more than a spec on my retina.  Of course, I had my eyes checked, but all results came back clear, as did the results for my visual cortex.  

Days later, what started as a dot in my peripheral began to grow.

The first time I saw it, I was at my doctor’s office.  He had left me alone for a moment whilst he consulted with my surgeon.  It was dark outside and the sound of heavy rain pit-a-patting against the glass was hypnotic. I stared out of the window, watching as a small handful of people came in and out of the hospital.  

Then, my eyes were drawn to an ominous silhouette at the far end of the parking lot.  I couldn’t make out any distinguishing features due to the minimal light, but there was something there, standing deadly still in the shadows.  

A car horn broke my reverie, a man was getting into his truck in the lot and must have pressed the horn by accident.  I turned back to the silhouette, and it was in a completely different position.  

It had moved.

It was standing eerily still again, but like it had frozen mid-walk.  I could just about make out its elongated limbs, like it’s arms and legs had been stretched out.  

The doctor returned momentarily, startling me.  He’d gotten my scans, and everything was how it should be.

“Good news, you should be okay to be discharged in a few days” he said.  

That was great news, I was so ready to get out of the hospital.  I turned back to the window in curiosity, but whatever I saw had gone.  

I didn’t think about it again until the night before I was going home.  It was late and most of the patients were sleeping.  My room is situated at the end of the hall, so I get a clear view of it through my observation window.  I wasn’t quite ready to go to sleep and was watching something on my iPad.

Suddenly, there was a putrid odour wafting in through my open door.  The same unmistakable smell that I’d experienced in that ‘other place’.  Two nurses walked past my room, neither showing any signs that they too could smell it.  I covered my nose and mouth to try and stop me from heaving. 

Then, my eyes drifted to the observation window, and to the corridor. 

It was here again.  The silhouette.

At the far end of the hall.  Completely still, with its back pressed up against the wall.  But I could see it.  It was tall and skinny, and had either feelers or tentacles stretched up against the wall like an ink spill.  Its daunting yellow eyes stared straight at me. 

I saw another nurse walk up the hall and straight past it, like it wasn’t there.  Maybe it wasn’t.  Maybe visual hallucinations were a symptom of what I’d been through, or maybe it was a side effect of the many meds I was taking.  I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.

“There’s nothing there, there’s nothing there, it isn’t real” I whispered to myself. 

I opened my eyes and, it hadn’t gone.

It had moved closer.  

Halfway down the hall.  It had dropped onto all fours like a large dog.  Starring straight at me.  Its long tentacles spread across the floor and up the wall. 

I was absolutely petrified.  

I moved over to the window, tentatively.  The smell that resonated from this creature was overpowering.  I watched it for a few moments, until a nurse walked past the window, startling me.  And, like before, when I looked back, it wasn’t there.  It was as though I’d imagined it.  I climbed back into bed, but I didn’t sleep a wink that night. 

The next morning, my mom came to pick me up.  I left with a suitcase of medication and instructions on how and when to take them.  I didn’t tell my mom or anyone at the hospital about my hallucinations.  I was worried If I did say something, the doctors wouldn’t let me leave.  

I had decided to stay at my mom’s until I was ready to talk with Scott.  He brought a box over with some essentials, like my comfy clothes, pyjamas, and my own toothbrush as I’d been using a cheap store bought one up to now.  He was sorry, and it was clear he hadn’t been sleeping.  He said he’d wait for me until I was ready to talk.  I missed both him and our home so much, but I just wasn’t ready to talk about it.  Not yet. 

My mom suggested that I go into town, see the locals, get some fresh air into my lungs.  She offered to drive me, and then we would meet back up at the car after an hour.

Whilst in town, I noticed a poster for the yearly travelling fairground in a storefront window.  I have fond memories growing up of this fair.  It’s where Scott and I shared our first kiss.  We were halfway round the Ferris wheel, when it started to rain.  He covered us with his jacket, and then he kissed me.  This was the moment I knew I’d fallen in love with him.  I was flooded with happy emotions, and it felt right that I text Scott.

“I’m ready to talk, I’ll be at the place where we shared our first kiss at 8 tonight, Chloe x”. 

He replied almost instantly.

“I’ll be there, thank you x”.

After a quick smile to myself, I went for a walk through the local market.  It was bustling with energy.  Vendors selling local, fresh produce, handmade furniture, bakeries, and plenty more. 

After browsing the stalls, I was hit with that smell.  That horrific, nauseating smell.  And I felt the hairs on my arms prickle up.  

I knew it was here.  Somewhere.  Observing me.

My eyes narrowed as I scanned the area.  I weaved in and out of the locals looking for it.  Paranoia struck me like lightning.  I was bumping into people as I went.  All eyes had now turned to me.  I burst into tears, sprinted back to the lot and leaped into my mother’s car.  

I was sitting in the passenger seat crying my eyes out.  I looked out of the window and saw my mother rushing back to the car shouting my name.  Someone must have told her about my freak out. 

I looked out of the opposite window and, IT WAS THERE, standing on top of a vehicle several cars over! 

“GET AWAY FROM ME” I screamed. 

My mother whipped open the door.

“What is it?  What happened?” she replied.

She couldn’t see it.  Nobody could.  I told her that I’d had a panic attack.  I hadn’t been around people outside of the hospital for a few months and I felt overwhelmed.  She knew I wasn’t being truthful, but it’s the only answer I could give.

That night I decided to go ahead and meet Scott at the fair.  When I saw him waiting for me by the Ferris wheel, my heart felt hole again, if only for a moment.  We got our tokens and went on the wheel.  We talked as we went round, about how sorry he was and how much of an idiot he’d been, which I agreed with.

Everything was going well until I saw the creature again.  Standing on top of the ghost house attraction.  Watching me.

I kept my eyes on the figure whilst grabbing Scott’s arm.

“Do you see it?” I asked with a shaky voice. 

“See what?” he replied. 

“It’s standing right there, on top of the ghost house”.

I could see him squinting to look, but I knew deep down that he wouldn’t be able to see it, because only I could. 

“Sweetheart, there’s nobody there, look at me” he replied, calmly. 

“I can’t” I said solemnly.  “If I look away, it’ll move”. 

“Chloe, look at me, there’s nothing there” he said, as he grabbed my chin and turned my face towards his.

“No!  it’ll move” I screamed.

I quickly spun round, my eyes darting back to the ghost house, but it wasn’t there.  I looked around, anxiously, Scott looking on with worry.

“Shit, where is it?”  My anxiety palpable.

I looked down, and it was at the bottom of the Ferris wheel.  It had moved inhumanly fast.  I screamed and almost fell out of the carriage, but Scott held onto me. 

“Hey, hey, I got you, what is it?”  he said, desperately trying to keep hold of me. 

I stood up in a panic, rocking the carriage, Scott tried to hang onto me, but it was too late, and I plummeted twenty feet to the ground.  

The last thing I remember, was Scott screaming for an ambulance. 

I was fortunate enough to only suffer a sprained wrist and a slight concussion.  My doctor wanted to keep me in overnight for observations, which I reluctantly agreed to. 

I decided to confide in Scott.  I told him everything.  From the cave in the forest to this creature that’s stalking me.  This monstrous entity that must have crawled out of the pits of hell.  And worst of all, it’s getting closer to me. 

He could see that I was terrified, and instead of trying to explain away what I was experiencing, he just held me.  And, for the first time in a long time, I felt safe.  We spent hours just holding each other.  He offered to stay the night, to stay awake in the chair whilst I got some sleep, but I couldn’t have him doing that. 

After Scott left, I managed to get a few hours rest.  I woke up just after two AM and grabbed my bottle of water from the nightstand.  That’s when I noticed the door was closed, even though I specifically requested it to stay open. 

And then, there was that horrendous smell.  I knew it was close. 

It was in the fucking room.

It was crouched down in the corner on all fours, blending into the darkness, watching me.  I desperately tried to scream but no sound would come out.

Keeping my eyes on it, I slowly climbed out of the bed with my back pressed firmly against the wall.  I knew it couldn’t move if I didn’t look away.  I side-stepped along the wall towards the door.  

I started to manoeuvre around a set of drawers, knocking something off that caught my eye for a millisecond.  But that’s all it took.  It was now standing on its two legs.

It must have been eight-feet tall with outstretched limbs.  A streak of moonlight illuminated part of it’s pale-blue face.  Its yellow eyes glistened in the light.  Its slimy tentacles spread up the wall and onto the roof.  

I kept my back to the wall and kept moving.  I made it to the door, grabbed the door handle, but it was fucking locked.  I kicked the door, but nobody could hear me.

I could see the key for the door on the table in my peripheral.  I fumbled around on the table without looking.  I grabbed everything but the key.  I knew I had to look to find the key. 

I quickly glanced to my left – Saw the key – Looked back, and the creature was point-blank in front of me.  Reaching out for my throat, its black, curved talon had pierced my neck and blood trickled down.  

Somehow, I managed to scream and within seconds two orderlies had barged through the door.  All they found was me, alone with blood trickling down my neck.  I barged straight past them and ran as fast as I could out of the hospital.

I ended up running all the way home.  I banged as loud as I could on the door, forgetting that it was almost three-thirty in the morning.  Scott answered the door in his pyjamas with a worried look plastered across his face.

I told him what had happened at the hospital whilst he bandaged my neck.

“See, this is proof that what I’m seeing is real, this is physical proof, you believe me, right, you have to?” I barked. 

After a momentary pause, he replied:

“Yes, I believe you.  I believe...  I believe you’re seeing something”. 

I registered the pause, and the hesitation in his voice.  He didn’t believe me, and I didn’t blame him.

After talking for a few hours, I had calmed down enough that I told Scott to get some sleep.  He was reluctant to leave me, so he took a nap in the chair.  I grabbed my laptop and searched the web for anything related to what was happening to me.  

There’re thousands of incidents across the world relating to haunted houses, demons, cults, and possessions, but none that was specific to the entity that was stalking me. 

Every time I heard a sound, a car outside or a floorboard creek I jumped.  I was a nervous wreck.  I went into the kitchen to grab a glass of water.  I looked out of the window into the darkness, expecting to see it watching me.  But it wasn’t. 

I went back into the room, and –

IT WAS THERE!

I dropped the glass, and it shattered on the floor.  Scott leaped from the chair. 

“What, what is it?”

I couldn’t speak.  My lips were glued shut.  I slowly raised my hand and pointed at it.  It was standing at the far end of the room.  I kept my eyes on it the entire time.  Scott rushed over to me. 

“Hey, Chloe, there’s nothing there sweetheart, whatever you’re seeing isn’t real”.

He headed towards it. 

“NO, SCOTT, PLEASE DON’T!” I pleaded, as I grabbed his arm.

He shrugged it off and marched over to it. 

“There’s nothing here, I’m going to prove it to you” he said. 

He cocked his arm back and swung his fist, only his arm stopped mid-swing.

HE HIT THE FUCKING CREATURE!

I moved to grab Scott and stood bare foot on the broken shards of glass, cutting my feet, I screamed out, and for a split second, I looked down.

And that’s all it took.

When I looked up, the creature had already grabbed Scott and folded him in half like a piece of paper.  The sound of his spine breaking echoed through the room.  Scott laid dead on the floor, his eyes widen open and looking at me. 

I screamed and backed away into the kitchen.  I slammed the door shut and ran to the rear door.  It was locked and I’d left my keys in my bag in the front room.  I noticed Scott’s cell on the countertop, so I grabbed it and ran down into the basement. 

I shut the door and pushed the spare fridge in front of it.  And then I hid in the corner.  Crouched down beside the washing machine.

Which is where I am now.  Hiding.  Crying.  I can’t call anyone because Scott’s cell doesn’t have a signal down here, which is why I’m recording this message on his cell in the hopes that someone will hear my story. 

I can hear it now, moving around upstairs.  It knows my eyes will be watching the door, so it’s looking for another way in.  I’m so scared.

I’m the reason Scott’s dead.  My true love.  And I’ll never forgive myself for that.  The thought of that is far worse than anything that monster can do to me.

Oh God, it’s here!  

The old fucking laundry chute!  Goddammit!  

WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU?!?! 

It’s watching me with those horrifying yellow eyes.

I can’t keep running because it’ll find me.

And I won’t put anyone else in danger.

It’s me that it wants. 

Scott I’m so sorry, I love you so much.  

And Mom, I love you so much.

I’m going to close my eyes now. 

Three.

Two.

One.
