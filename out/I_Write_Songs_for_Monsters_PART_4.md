“You know who you’re speaking with, do ya?”  

 
I didn’t. But I also didn’t trust the sound of his voice; it was too mechanical, too inhuman.   

 

“Um, well...” My phone felt heavy in my hand.   

 

“This is Lester, you idiot!”  

 

He said his last name, but I couldn’t comprehend it – the name doesn’t exist in our reality – so I smartly kept my mouth shut. I was exhausted, and needing my morning coffee. I groaned. Why did I call that number before coffee?  

 

“I run the music biz!”  

 

That caught my attention. I regarded the business card Ivan gave me the previous night; it had no name on it, only a phone number and email address, plus a creepy symbol of an eyeball floating over a treble clef.   

 

“So,” I said slowly, while lumbering toward the coffee maker, “what does this mean for me?”  

 

An uncomfortable silence ensued, long enough for me to fill the coffee maker. Finally, as I was about to repeat the question, Lester – presumably a lizard person – spoke up.  

 

“I want to record you, you idiot! Why else would I have you contact me?”  

 

More silence. After the horrific week I’d had, my tolerance for nonsense had greatly diminished. I filled my mug to the brim and had a sip. The caffeine came quickly to my aid.  

 

“Say that again,” I said, buying time. “This time, nicer.”  

 

Lester chuckled; it was a heartless laugh. Already, I was suspicious. Monsters, I’d learned the hard way, are not to be trusted.  

 

“I run the music biz,” he repeated himself. “Most of it, anyhow. But with the emergence of IA, I could lose everything. I need another hit song. Fast.”   

 

He paused.   

 

I gulped the coffee and refilled my mug.  

 

“I’m not gonna name drop,” he continued, “but let’s just say I’ve helped many pop artists over the past twenty-five years.”  

 

I didn’t believe him. But as a freelance musician, I didn’t dismiss him either. This could be my big break.  

 

“Soooo,” he slithered, “Frank...”  

 

“Hank,” I interrupted.  

 

“Right, Hank.” He hissed. “I’ll cut to the chase. The monster community feels grossly unrepresented in the music community. Unfortunately, they can’t carry a tune to save their lives. Not even autotune can help. Believe me, we’ve tried.”  

 

I ran to the washroom, and urinated. Why was I having this conversation before noon?   

 

Lester kept talking, “We like your rendition of Last Train to Deathsville...”  

 

Ugh, that song again.  

 

“I want to record you playing it live. Then I’ll have my guys fix it up. We’ll do a remix, slap on a pretty face, and voila! Hit song.”  

 

Remix? Really? I couldn't believe it. Then again, was I really shocked that the music biz was run by lizards? And what did he mean by ‘slapping on a pretty face?’  

 

“Which means...” I tried to think of something clever to say, and failed, “the song won’t be under my name?”  

 

“Don’t play dumb!” he snapped. “You’re ugly. And stupid. But you have a nice voice. And you play a mean piano. You’ll be properly compensated for your efforts, of course. But you’ll need to sign a contract, and keep your mouth shut. Except, of course, when you’re singing.”  

 

This was his attempt at humor. I wanted to stick a fork in my ears. “How much money are we talking?”  

 

He made me an offer; one I couldn’t refuse. The piano – which was destroyed by a pack of dogmen – would be replaced, he promised. (And taken off my pay, of course).   

 

He emailed me a contract, and I signed it.   

 

And that’s how I started writing songs for monsters. A decision I deeply regret.    

 

When I showed up for the gig that night, there was a keyboard waiting for me. It looked really expensive. Top of the line. I ignored the prying eyes penetrating me, and meandered towards the minuscule stage.   

 

As I passed the bar, Ivan shouted, “Hank!”   

 

I stopped. Hearing monsters speak my name is something I’ll never get used to.  

 

“The man of the hour.” Ivan was surrounded by a lounge of lizard people dressed like old fashioned pimps: purple suits, polyester, high-heeled boots and bowties. The way they licked their faces was sickening.  “Everything is all set up for you.”   

 

His eyes were gleaming, his hair extra greasy. I spotted a splattering of blood on his cheek.  

 

As I pulled away, he said, “Here. The boss wanted you to have this.”   

 

He handed me a list of songs; none of which were real, of course.   

 

I took the list, and found my way to the keyboard. At least the keys weren’t bones. I fiddled with the settings and tested the microphone. Everything, it seemed, was good to go.  

 

A throbbing spotlight found me. Already, I was sweating. I tried not to notice the headless zombies sitting in the front row. Not only did they stink, they were shoving plates of food and drink down their necks. I nearly vomited. Why were they even here? They couldn’t see me, nor could they hear the music. None of this made any sense.   

 

The lizards sitting around the bar stared at me with beady little eyes. I wondered which one was Lester. Probably the one sitting in the middle, with the checkered suit and dark sunglasses. On cue, he waved and licked his face. I gagged.  

 

There were thirteen songs on the list. Ten of which I knew from the previous night. The others I’d have to make up on the fly and hope for the best.   

 

I opened with Deathsville – the song Lester planned on recording – and nailed it. The monsters went crazy, packing the dance floor. Food and drinks were spilled. Before I started the next song, the pixie flew over and blew me a kiss on the cheek, much to the dismay of Bronzie the Brute. He came over and punched me square in the nose.   

 

My face exploded.   

 

Pain was instantaneous. I needed medical assistance. Fast. Blood was pouring out of me like spilled wine. Bronzie was standing over me, fists like anvils, ready to rumble. I closed my eyes and prepared for the worst.  

 

To my surprise, Ivan came rushing to my aid. “Get him out of here” he shouted, pointing to Bronzie.    

 

A team of security rushed over and dragged Bronzie away. The headless zombies were standing over me, poking me with their pudgy fingers. Ivan shoved them aside and threatened to have them ejected.  

 

I must’ve fainted, because I awoke in a stuffy office next to the kitchen. Ivan was patching me up. I was leaking blood by the barrelful, and in great distress. I didn’t trust the way his eyes sparkled at the site of my blood. Pain meds were offered, and I gobbled them.   

 

Tony came charging into the office. “Did you get what you needed?” he asked Lester.  

 

Lester nodded.   

 

“Excellent.” 

 

They shuffled out of the office and started bickering back and forth.  

 

I sat slumped on an uncomfortable chair. The office stank. Even with my broken nose, I could smell the rot and decay. An aging laptop sat atop a rickety wooden desk, with pencils and pens scattered across it. Next to it was a picture of Tony with his hideous children – all boys as far as I could tell – plus his picturesque wife, who looked like a robot. Brown boxes were stacked to the ceiling. Weapons were scattered haphazardly around the room: machine guns, pistols, knives, handcuffs. You name it. Plus, weapons I couldn’t comprehend, nor wanted to.    

 

Tony and Ivan were still bickering; I heard Tony ask, “What are we gonna do with him?” 

 

“We can’t kill him,” Ivan said. “We need more songs.”  

 

My heart turned to ice. I needed to escape. But how? If I could get my hands on some serious cash, I could split. Move up to Canada, perhaps. They’d never find me there; it’s too cold.   

 

By now, the pain meds were making me queasy; I tried not to faint again. Tony reentered the office. He came over, grabbed my face, and snapped my nose back into place.  I screamed; the pain was extraordinary. He slapped me across the face, and told me to shut up, then he knelt down on one knee and put his fatty face close to mine. His breath was unforgivable.  

  

“Listen here, you little shit.” His face was twisted and bent, his eyes cold and calculated. “You’re lucky we need you. Otherwise...” he cracked his knuckles.   

 

Ivan spoke next. “We have what we need,” he assured Tony. “The song is already in preproduction. It should be out next week. Two weeks, tops.” He regarded me pitifully. “First take, too.” He laughed horribly as he patted me on the back.  

 

I wanted to die. Death would be better than this. A strange aroma was coming from the kitchen. I looked over and gagged. The cooks – squid-like creatures wearing bloodstained aprons – were serving up human brains.   

 

“Get him home,” Tony ordered. He snapped his fingers. A pair of giants entered the office and dragged me towards the back door. They threw me out, then kicked me in the ribs for good measure.  

 

My face was numb, my ribs hurt like hell, and my legs were wobbly. With tremendous effort, I lifted myself to my feet and regarded the long flight of stairs leading to the deserted parking lot. There were bloodstains on the stairs. And graffiti. 

  

“I’ve got to leave town,” I muttered. “Pronto.”  As I was halfway up the stairs, the back door opened.  

 

Ivan poked out. “You forgot something,” he said. His pasty lips stretched as he spoke. He was holding an envelope stuffed with enough cash to replace my crappy Honda.  

 

I loped downstairs and snatched it.  

 

“See ya Tuesday,” he said, before slamming the door in my face.  

 

Once home, I plopped onto my bed, trembling. Everywhere, I hurt. How did I get myself in the mess? But I knew the answer. The Readhead. She was to blame. Whoever she was. I closed my eyes and succumbed to nightmares.   

 

The weekend went by in a drunken blur. I drank enough whiskey and beer to forget my problems, something I hadn’t done since college. But I was lonely. And scared. Every time I looked out my window, a black SUV drove past. Sometimes it was parked across the street. Waiting.    

 

They were watching me.    

 

Why was I surprised?   

 

By Tuesday I was sick of booze and sick of my one one-bedroom unit, and sick of being alone. Mostly, I was sick of monsters. Yes, I had more songs to sing. But this time, I was prepared. This time, I’d have my [revenge.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)
