I just woke up but something feels… off. It’s dark and I don't remember going to sleep. I know this is my room but the date on my phone says it’s March of 2024. The last thing I remember is laying in this room last month apparently. My clock says it’s 3:00 p.m., though I can still see the stars. Wait… I think I heard something. It sounds like my mom, but she sounds happy somehow. My mom is a very dull and sad person. I love her but i dont think ive ever seen her smile or even heard her laugh. I'm going to see what's wrong. I slowly crack open my door to see a light on in the kitchen. “Come on down and have dinner with us sweetie!” says my mom. Us? It's just me and my mom. My dad left before I was born and I never had siblings. Who could be here? And who has dinner at 3:00 in the afternoon? While it's dark? Out of curiosity, I swipe my pocket knife off my dresser, and headed down. What else was I supposed to do? I couldn't hide in my bedroom forever, I couldn't go back to sleep, my heart was beating too fast. My pocket knife in hand, just in case. I get downstairs and see her, my mom, but she isn't. I notice things most people won't. Her eyes are a slightly darker green, and her  eyebrows slightly too far apart. I don't know who else she could be though. But… 

I just woke up. Again. What was that? Some weird dream? That must be it. It's still dark. But now it says that it's 3:17 in the afternoon. Am I still dreaming? I pinch myself. “Ow!” Well, I'm awake. “Come down and have dinner with us sweetie!” Again? What? Who is she? Maybe someone broke in? I would have heard a bang or glass breaking though. I go down again. Who knows, maybe it's just a coincidence, and somehow she's pranking me now? I go downstairs once again and she's still there. Her eyes are right this time. I ask her why we're eating dinner at 3:00, and why it's dark. “I didn't say anything about dinner.” She simply states. She's using contractions. My mom is an english teacher and believes contractions are just short cuts so she refuses to use them. “What? Well then… who did?” my mom’s eyes turn a dark red and her smile creaks further than i've ever seen anyone smile. She lets out an inhuman scream.

I just woke up. The clock now reads 3:34 p.m. I can see the stars shining brighter than ever. I don't remember writing what was previously stated. I don't know if it was just a story I thought of or a warning, but I now know, don't go downstairs when it's dark. “Come down and have dinner with us sweetie!” nope. Not this time. Even if I can't sleep, laying here in the dark must be better than what awaits me. “Sweetie?” Was that closer? “I know you're awake sweetie!” ignore her. Ignore it. Ignore her voice. Ignore the footsteps gaining on my room. Ignore the bangs on my door. Ignore the drill unscrewing my doorknob. Ignore it. Just go to sleep. It will all go away if you go to sleep. Ignore the door breaking open and ignore the screams. 

I just woke up. What's happening? I don't remember this. Again apparently. I’d say it was a story but evidently i've already thought this. How can I get out of this- loop? I can't go back to sleep, and I can't go downstairs. The clock now reads 3:51. It's always the same amount of time. 17 minutes. That means I have 17 minutes to figure out what to do. I don't know how much longer I can do this for. Or what happens when it actually gets to be night. Will it be light out? I'm not sure if I want to find out. There is a window, but what happens if I fall and die? Do I start over again? Maybe I could just go downstairs and make a run for it. She always acts normal at first apparently so i could try just acting normal. Then I could sneak out. I guess I could try that first. “Come down and have dinner with us sweetie!” I guess that's my queue. One last try. Hopefully. I head down. Step by step, closer and closer. I'm not even sure what I'll find. All I know is all you know. I see her. That's my mom. The first time I said some things about her were off but this was her. I wonder if it actually is. “How'd you sleep sweetie?” She turns to the stove. Nope that's not her. Still using contractions. “Good.” I say. This is my chance. I ran quietly to the door. She doesn't see me. The door is unlocked. Right before I get out, I see her turn around. I dash. What else can I do? I feel my bare foot touch the gravel. I’m… free. 

I just woke up. Where's my journal?
