I need help figuring out what the boundary is between a healthy hobby and an unhealthy obsession. Whether how crazy I’ve been going is just a sign that maybe I need to get some extra sleep, just start getting used to compromising now that we’re living together, or if it’s justified.

My girlfriend and I moved in together about half a year ago. We’d always lived with our parents or by ourselves, so I was excited to just not be alone all evening without the stress of living with someone you’ve never met (I’ve always bounced place to place, never where I know anybody, and small talk with strangers makes me grit my teeth, let alone living with one) and she was excited for things to get a little calmer (her parents are great people, but drama seems to find them like a magnet in that too-close-knit neighborhood they refuse to move out of). On the second day of moving in, before we’d even had a chance to unpack our stuff all the way, she got the first plant. A variegated pothos to one day drape over the shelf overhanging where the TV would one day be.

A housewarming gift for ourselves, she called it. At the time, slumped in a heap together against the bottom step of our living room stairs, worn out from a day of hauling boxes without a couch or even a kitchen chair to sit on yet, I was just happy she was so happy, that she was so happy *with me*. Besides, it did look good there. I could see the vision, what she was going for, back then. And it wasn’t too expensive either, bought on sale for less than a dollar from an old lady selling plants out of her pickup truck in the parking lot of the supermarket down the street.

They trickled in slowly the first month, while we were busy balancing unpacking boxes, arranging furniture deliveries, and subletting our old place with the 9-5 grind. A spider plant for the nightstand (and fast-growing propagations, I found out later). A peace lily for an occasional pop of white in our beige-painted living room. A few hanging baskets of petunias and begonias for the back deck, coupled with an orchid for the window by the desk. Scraps of potato and green onion and the aforementioned propagations, little experiments collected in repurposed wine crystals and shotglasses perched on windowsills. Bit by bit, the collection started growing.

Things were starting to get crowded, but at the same time they were starting to get *fantastic*. We found each other to be as easy company as we’d thought, maybe even more. I actually found myself looking forward to getting home at night to our home, *our* home, like I’d look forward to meeting up for a date. We sang as loudly as we wanted, slow danced in the living room, cooked better-than-restaurant meals without ever having to worry about running out of counterspace or setting off a poorly-placed and worse-ventilated smoke detector.

It got worse after we found the mice.

We were down to our last bit of unpacking, a handful of boxes that contained the contents of our closets that we had, well, just left in our new closets largely unpacked, procrastinated on until we’d finally gotten sick of looking at them. I was dealing with one of those “scrap boxes” – you know, the box that’s got all the stuff that populates the upper shelf of your closet, stuff that’s accumulated through your life because maybe one day it’ll come in handy or at one point you were attached to it. Shoeboxes, interesting rocks, a horseshoe dug up from a garden, Christmas cards from people you love, VHS tapes of your favorite childhood movies, that kind of stuff interspersed with, oh, birth certificates, family heirlooms, important tax records, the deed to the house, little things like that. Lots of little things to pick through, ponder pitching, and then give up and sort somewhere out of the way where you won’t see it again until the next time you move, or pick up and say *oh, hell, why would I put that there?* before putting it somewhere equally stupid in the frenzy of unpacking.

This particular one contained a lot of her trophies from childhood – spelling bee, math Olympian, swim team. The usual haul, or at least that’s what she would say. I, for one, was never quite good enough at much of anything to get a trophy.

Anyway, I’d nearly emptied everything out of it, taking my time plopping trophies on random shelves (I’d have asked her where she wanted them to go, but she was outside happily dangling morning glories on a trellis and I didn’t want to ask), when I started to notice a smell. *The* smell, the one that you never want to smell when you open the hood of a malfunctioning car or a trapped basement or, well, a moving box. The smell of something dead. I lifted it and looked at the corners and didn’t see any signs of corners being chewed or tape being torn, so I figured maybe it was coming from somewhere else (still ominous, but a kind of ominous best dealt with once I’d gotten rid of all the clutter) and moved on with emptying the box.

Holy shit. I was expecting, at most, one shriveled little mouse at the bottom that had somehow snuck in and been entombed. Instead, what I saw sent me running straight for the toilet, and not just because of the stench. In addition to a month’s rot, they had clearly been smashed to hell in the process of moving. One of them had somehow had its guts squeezed out through its mouth like a toothpaste tube, and several of them somehow had little clovers starting to grow out of the gaps where their crushed little bones had torn their flesh under the weight of rattling pedestals and medals. There was a deep puddle of curdled blood beneath them that had started to scum over like a pond and jiggled like gelatin when I kicked the box backing away in shock.

She must have heard me retching (so much for trying not to interrupt her, huh?) and came running in to check on me.

“I’m okay,” I said, still gasping (yeah, I’ve got a weak stomach, so sue me). “Don’t go in the closet.”

“What’s in the closet?” she asked, ignoring me and marching straight into the room.

I winced, grabbed a wad of toilet paper to wipe my mouth, and moved away for her. Instead, she came into the bathroom wide-eyed, pale, shivering.

“I told you I’d put that box away,” she said quietly, distantly. She was in shock, I think. She’d always had a soft spot for animals – she’d always had pet rabbits and hamsters before we moved in together (I’m allergic) and what was sickening for me must have been *horrifying* for her.

Cleaned up enough to be at least somewhat comforting, I hugged her.

“It’s okay,” I said.

“I’m sorry you had to see that. It was in my stuff,” she said.

“It’s still okay. I didn’t want you to have to see that, either” I said.

She buried my face in her chest and we just stood there like that. Neither one of us cried, although I certainly felt like it and I’m sure she did too. We both wanted to be tough for each other. One of the things I like about us.

Once we’d gotten enough revulsion out of us, we grabbed some newspapers from the garage and covered the box in them. Neither of us wanted to look at that again, and she didn’t care enough about the few remaining medals to want to salvage them from that mess. We took it out to the firepit in our backyard, stacked some logs up beside it, and cremated those poor, unloved creatures.

Unpleasant as it was, I thought that would be the end of it. Instead, she stayed quiet, pensive. Unlike me, she’d never even been fishing as a kid, never watched horror movies, never played violent video games. I think it must have messed with her more than it messed with me.

And that messiness manifested itself outwardly in more houseplants. Monsteras cropped up in corners of rooms, succulents pooled across shelves now laced with philodendron curtains, ferns and figs loomed over me in every room. It started to feel like a jungle, and let me tell you, the rainforest is fun to visit but a terrible place to live.

It’s bad enough now it’s starting to mess with my head a bit. I can’t find anything – books, tape measures, pencils, all buried beneath intertangled plants. I find myself tripping over pots at night, spilling dirt all over the place that I can’t even be bothered to clean up anymore. One of them even scared the shit out of me at one point. It was late at night and I could’ve sworn the fronds were turning to flesh, splotches of pale pink mixed in with the green. Turns out, it was just a Pink Princess Philodendron, which I didn’t know was a thing and still don’t know how I feel about it.

Dead plants are becoming a problem, too. There’s so many she can’t keep up with them. Hell, *we* can’t keep up with them – I try to keep up with watering and tending to them too, if there’s one thing I hate more than living in a house cluttered with living plants it’s a house cluttered with dead plants, but they keep dying on us anyway. The house is starting to feel haunted with all the withered, twisted dead plants around, lurking in the shadows of the still-living. Sometimes I see them swaying in a draft, or catch them shriveling in really weird ways – ferns cutting their own leaves as they wither, succulents with red blisters and sores on them, sun-bleached pothos forming little holes like cigarette burns.

I’ve pointed out the increasing frequency of plant death to her, asked her nicely to not leave pots in walkways, even sat down with her once and told her that we should focus on taking care of the plants we have before getting any more. She always apologizes, swears she’ll do better, and then a few days later I come home from work and there’s more houseplants.

She just smiles, that cute little guilty-not-guilty smile, and apologizes. “They just looked so cute, and that lady’s prices are so good, and besides what’s one more going to hurt?”

At this point I want to scream that, when you already have four times more than you should have, one more doesn’t become absorbable – it becomes exponentially worse.

Maybe I’m being dramatic, but it’s gotten to the point that all I can think about is the damn houseplants. It distracts me at work, I get no sleep, even my girlfriend has noticed that I seem distant lately. I want to tell her it’s the plants, but maybe it is just me, you know? After all, my parents never had any plants, maybe I’m just not even used to a normal number and so having slightly more than usual is driving me nuts.

So I’m asking you all for help. Am I being unreasonable? If not, how do I nicely confront her about this hoarding habit she’s acquired? Has anyone been through something like this before?
