Last week I met up with an old friend of mine; we had fallen out of contact sometime around 2011, and since the Internet, or at least what’s left of it is up again it didn’t take us long to get in contact again.

When he reached out to me, he said he was out in one of the towns left over near the western Lake Superior floodplains, and that he had something I needed to see, and now I can confidently say he was right.

Standing in his muddy driveway was a gunked-up washed-out brick of an RV, some stray stickers still hanging onto the algae-stained panels. That car had been my home for what felt like years, and sure enough after a short search we pulled out a few leftover relics of our road tripping days, the old banged up CB, Jules old box of cassettes now cracked and stained from spending a decade in floodwater.

But the thing that caught me off guard was an old leather-bound book, small and through the magic that is Tupperware containers shielded from the stains of time. It was my old journal, the one I had tried to maintain through months on the road, doing my best to diligently record our day to day.

I can’t guarantee this is going to be any kind of grand odyssey, or even that it will be a comprehensive record, but I will do my best to transcribe my memory of events, starting all the way from our departure from Duluth to the reason we eventually abandoned the RV.

It's been a while and my memory can be a bit hazy, but I will try to add context where I can, fill some of the gaps. It'll take some time, as I plan to get in contact with some more of my fellow travelers, so I will need to split this into installments, the first of which I will transcribe below.

**Rapture Roatrip Diary, First Entry 04.05.2010 -Leaving Duluth**

*Before anyone asks about the choice of title, I know it's odd.*

*When it first began some people compared the flooding to the rapture, but in the months after it's starting to feel like more of a purgatory, nonetheless I'm sticking with this title because I'm lazy and also because it sounds good.*

*Duluth is behind us now, not that there is much left of it, most of the smaller houses had been swept away by the lake, and the ones that remained stand waterlogged, basements flooded. The time after had been quiet, after the initial panic we began our slow decay.*

*People have been speculating about the apocalypse since we understood what time was, but living through it, it just felt so real, so mundane.*

*The people that didn't drown of freeze to death, those that had escaped the floodwaters started coming down with a fever, the fever that halved the population of Minnesota.*

*And after that we simply existed, people kept working their jobs even while the news from out of state became sparse, even after the internet was gone, and even now that we haven't heard from anywhere but the nearest few towns for months.*

*My mother survived the fever, but deep down I know a part of her didn't, my brother and father treat her as if she were dead, but they won't let her die. This is in part why I am leaving town, I can't stand to live in ruins anymore, not the ruins of Duluth not the ruins of my family.*

*It's bearable by day, but when the lights dim, and we huddle around flickering lightbulbs, it's like they're all still here, the people who died. It started small, people seeing shadows that didn't have the right shape, lights turning off. Then came the footsteps and knocking, until hardly anyone could chalk it up to stress or grief, sooner or later we all collectively understood, if not out loud, that something wasn't right with the water. Those that drank it fell ill with fever, those that waded through it dreamt strange dreams, and wherever it went the voices followed.*

*I look forward to being away from this graveyard if a city, far from flooded basements and dodgy footbridges.*

*The RV is bouncing over the warped asphalt, but we are making good progress. Soon we will be gliding over the highway off to anywhere but here.*

*Over the radio I can hear an argument break out between Josh, who is sat in the passenger seat of the beat up Volvo station wagon carrying most of our food and blankets, smoking excessively, and Vera, Who I can barely make out sitting in the Porsche leading the way ahead of us.*

*Vera is complaining on the CB about the most recent addition to our caravan, who riding on a 4 cylinder Kawasaki wouldn't be able to hear us even if he had a radio with him.*

*"He just seems off, he just shows up a couple of days ago saying he needs to skip town? That seems awfully sketchy if you ask me"*

*Vera rants before being cut off when Mara, who just got up from her bunk in the RV grabs the handset.*

*"I don't care what you think of him, he says he knows the roads around here, and he helped pay for gas. Far as I care he could be a convicted felon."*

*"Say what you will but he ain't sleeping in the bed"*

*Droned the CB, Mark had installed the receiver in the pickup himself, a choice we all regretted after having to listen to him for more than two minutes.*

*Jules cuts in from the front seat telling us to all zip it so he can turn up his music, and we pull out onto the open road to the tune of ACDC's back in black.*

*It had all started as me and Jules, but Mara bought her spot by finding us an RV, and since we wanted Leo to come along we had to invite his girlfriend, so he and Vera joined us in his fathers 912.*

*Mark and Kate joined us about the same way, until they broke up,*

*neither of them backed down so having lost his spot in Kate's Volvo to her brother Josh he bought the pickup, a decision we all appreciated now that we have space to sleep comfortably in the RV.*

*That leaves only Ira as the odd one out, he had showed up in town months prior on one of the few freight trains that still pass through, we all knew he was trouble, but he had a duffle bag full of cash he could spend on gas and supplies so we were in no position to decline.*

*Our plan is as vague and convoluted as our reasons for leaving the city, most of us just wanted to go on an adventure, see something new. And a year after the great flood things had settled down enough to allow for our little road trip.*

*Of course, I won't pretend I'm not nervous, some of the others try but there's no point in it.*

*We've all heard the stories, about towns where something stalks the streets at night, creeping from the vast floodplains in search of an open window, or of strangers that show up in the rain and just seem subtly wrong.*

*Of course these are just stories, we have always had stories, and even now that the whispering coming from the basement or the knocking in the walls is a reality we face, this doesn't make them all real, there is still no Easter bunny.*

The entry cuts off here, I recall being cut off by a large debate regarding what direction to head at a crossroads. I didn't remember rambling so much back then, but I guess I didn't have much to do on the road, and I wanted to make sure whoever read this understood what it was like back then. I had always intended to publish my journals, that's why I put in the effort to transcribe conversations and even had some of my friends write a page or two.

Not much happened on the first day on the road, we slept at a motel, and as much as some of us had been curious we were all relieved when nothing of note happened that night, I wish I could say it stayed that way for long.

I will continue with the second entry once I get the time to transcribe it all, it's been a long day, and it has been weird reading my own words again.

After the way things ended I was preoccupied, I never really got around to grieving, I was happy I got out alive.

Now I miss my friends, and I hope this is a chance to get to see some of them again.
