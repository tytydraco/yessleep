How could it still walk when we had blown its brains out just days ago? The impossible thing that we came across in the forest, my cousin and me. He had just come back home from the military, and I was home from college for summer break; we had gone hunting. Then the thing appeared from an abandoned house—that was never there before—as if it had been waiting there for someone. For us. Dressed in a tattered flannel shirt and jeans, the thing materialized from that dark place so unnaturally, like a mime on his fourth glass of wine, like a snake going through an aggressive seizure; the constant and relentless writhing of its arms that did not make sense in my head, the jerking of its joints, the neck twisting as if it were a crazed owl, the arms oscillating like stout pendulums.

Its face was an indecisive mess; it was a forever changing film reel of different people. I could only make out four of the many faces it presented itself to be: A woman, a little girl, an old man, and a dog. There was a strange bright cloud around its head as the face shifted and changed. It looked like a dream. But as it got closer to us, as it creeped its way through through the bush and the sticks—without making a single noise—the weird thing’s face began to focus. The golden mist about its head would slowly clear up, and the many faces would finally cease. In that moment, I was staring right back at myself. I don’t know how long I stood there, watching me wearing a confused and curious look.

“Pretty please, won’t you let me in?” said the strange thing. I could feel my body tense up, I wanted to run, to scream, to vomit. But all I could do was stand there. Then it happened, a loud crackle broke the silence of the forest. The strange thing stopped wriggling and writhing, it fell to the ground ever so softly. I turned to find my cousin holding his rifle upright, he had put a bullet between the thing’s eyes.

He looked at me, “We never talk about this. Ever.” 

Two days later, when I had gotten back home from a night out with college friends, I opened the front door to find muddy prints near the entrance. They did not look human. At first. They continued from the entrance and upstairs to the second floor. They went from looking like a strange animal’s paw prints, to small human feet. They stopped at my mother’s door, and I opened that too. Nothing, no more prints, no lights shone in the room. There were noises coming from the kitchen, noises that only now began to ring out in the house. I ran frantically downstairs and there she was, my mother in the kitchen cooking something in a pot. She turned her head and smiled; her auburn hair fell from her face. Her face was a little too excited.

“Hey sweetie, how was your night out? Are your friends doing, okay?” She asked me.
I did not answer at first, only because I was shocked from seeing her, the woman who would never be cooking at this time of night, the woman who had been away from some work trip for a couple of days now.

I stared at her stunned and perplexed, “Yeah they’re doing okay.”

Her smile grew wider, “That’s great honey. I will be done with this in few. You hungry?”

“No, not really. I ate something at the bar. Thanks though.”

“That’s okay. If you start to feel hungry again later, it’ll be here waiting for you.”

“Thanks, mom.” I walked away without looking back and went upstairs to my room. I didn’t think about the smell of the food until later. How sweet and decaying it smelt, as if she threw together a soup of pungent, dead things. I went to bed with the light on and stared at the door until I finally drifted off to sleep. I did not eat dinner that night.

The day after that, I visited my off and on-again boyfriend. He was honestly no good for me, but his touch, his intimacy was all worth it. The way he kissed me as if I were the last boy on Earth, the way he wrapped his arms around me. The way I traced my fingers along his skin soaked in sweat from the summer humidity; I was a cartographer, his body, my map. We had made love for a long time, in the silence, the noise that was our passion. His kisses became more desperate, more aggressive. He kissed my neck and for split second, his mouth came up to my ear and he whispered into it.

“Why won’t you let me in?” He asked. I didn’t register what he said at first, my eyes were still closed, and his skin began to feel different, off. It became leathery and taut. He had opened his mouth over my neck and kept still. I could feel tiny hands grasping at my neck, my ear; tiny hands that might have come from his mouth. His breath was freezing cold, and I started to shiver. I could feel his own hands trying to claw into my skin, and without effort, they did. I could feel his own fingers converging into my arms, and then my muscles, then my bones. There was a soft groan coming from that gaping mouth, and yet, I kept my eyes closed. I didn’t want to open them, to see what creature had taken hold of me. But if I wanted it to end, I had no choice. 

I opened my eyes, my boyfriend’s face had altered into something maniacal and mad, something so inhuman I could have lost my mind right then and there. I saw that wide gaping mouth, that black hole of a mouth in which those tiny hands had sprung from. He wouldn’t take his eyes off me. I yelled as loudly as I could. I pushed him off me and fell to the ground.

“What the fuck? What’s wrong with you?” He asked me.

I looked up to find a normal person in that bed. I was bewildered, completely fucking astonished. I didn’t say anything more to him. I got up, got dressed and left.

I never stopped asking myself how that thing could still walk. how such a thing could blink in and out of existence. If it did at all. I had questioned my own sanity, if I had experienced these things and that moment in the forest messed me up forever. It wasn’t until I was in the supermarket, and I looked at the missing people’s board. It wasn’t until I recognized some of the faces among the missing, their names were Sarah, Melanie, Samson and his companion, Scout. A woman, a little girl, an old man, and a dog. It hit me like a freight train, the realization of the people I was staring at.

Then the dreams started, the dreams in which I was lost in the forest and before me, was that strange, nonexistent house. Every night was like that now, perpetually lost in that thick world and that house trying to draw me in with its power, its source that many-faced creature. One day, I called my cousin because I was done. I was tired of no longer feeling under control of my own reality, of losing trust in those close to me. I called my cousin, but he did not answer the phone. His father, my uncle, did and I asked him where my cousin was. Uncle said that that my cousin had gone off the deep end and something snapped in him. He kept yelling about some monster he killed in the forest, but it continued to haunt him, to steal the bodies of everyone around him. He told me that my cousin left without saying anything. He’d taken his rifle with him too.

So, I had gone back to that forest, to that place that unraveled my life. I went back hoping to find my cousin normal and unscathed, but I knew that was highly unlikely. As I trekked along the path, sharp, high-pitched screams bounced off the trees. I ran further up the path past a winding road, and down the familiar hill we recently discovered. I expected to find the house down that hill. It was no longer there, all that was left of it was the door as it continued to stand upright and unbothered by the elements. My cousin was also there lying on the ground beside the door, his rifle beside him. I knelt down, he was panting like a sick dog, his eyes bulging out of his skull.

“Hey, are you okay? What happened?” I asked him.

It took a while for him to answer, “That…thing. It wouldn’t leave me alone. I came back here to find it again. To finish the job. I shot the fucker again, but it didn’t fall like last time. It kept creeping towards me. I didn’t know what else to do. It asked me to let it in…and I said okay.”

I didn’t know what to say. I stared at him and saw his face had become transparent, less solid, as if I were staring into a pool of water. His eyes were a different color than I had remembered, his voice was distant, like he had spoken to me on the other side of a vast, open tunnel.

I didn’t hesitate. I looked over and grabbed the rifle. I turned back ready to fire, but my cousin was no longer on the ground, in the corner of my eye, the door opened with a creak and slammed shut. I stood up and ran for the door and banged on it.

“No! Give him back!” I yelled repeatedly. “Please just…let me in.”

But the door never opened again that night, or any other night.
