I wasn’t always going to hell

Lucky for you guys, finding a phone able to get from where I am to the real world was easy enough. 

I had a very specific thing in mind when we went through the portal. Maybe not fire, brimstone and pitchforks, but adjacent. 

We aren’t going to hell though. We’re stalking a psychotic bastard through the side streets of the afterlife. If we’re lucky we won’t even be taking the onramp to the highway to hell. 

The best way I can describe the look of where we found ourselves is, alien. 

We’ve been through liminal space, non-Euclidian space, possessed homes and any other kind of variant of shitty environment. They all felt almost dreamlike. Things you’ve already seen, chewed up, tainted and spat out. 

But this place, every inch of it seems unique. 

It’s bright out, but there’s no sun in the too-low sky. Above us is  overcast, the clouds radiate a purple tinted light. 

At first glance, the area around us seems almost desert-like. Deep green sand, large enough to arguably be gravel crunches below our feet as we take our first steps. 

Not that far off sprout patches of flora, almost like islands in the vast, flat plains. 

Enthralled by the landscape, we see groups in the distance. Who they are, or why they’re here is a mystery. 

If you remember, last week Will said how this place is going to change us. How we aren’t just our bodies here. We’re the essence of who we are. 

At the moment, myself, Sveta, Alex and Leo, look and feel pretty much the same. Mike though…

Seeing as events have been dark lately, I want to play a game. Think about all you know of Mike ( Bonus points for everyone that scoured the internet and found his other adventures.). By now I’m sure you all have a good handle on the guy. 

He was hit by this place hard and completely. 

Now, what are you picturing? Some kind of Jeff the Killer lookalike? Maybe a clown-based demon? Or are you thinking more Jason Voorhees with a coating of clown paint?

 The answer is, none of the above. 

He came with us in full costume. Looking like five miles of bad road that was recently institutionalized. Kitted out in all manner of pointy things and firearms. You know, Mike. 

Not now though. 

His makeup is subtle, well done, and friendly. 

His hair is long, wavy and a just shy of natural shade of red. Puffing out below a jaunty tophat.

The tuxedo he wears is equal parts old-timey magician and hobo stereotype. Immaculately clean, and decorated with enough patches and bobbles to take away any stuffy vibe it may have. 

The man himself is free from scars, he stands straighter, might even be a little younger. 

“Um, Mike?” I type, aghast. 

“Are you okay?” Leo asks, concerned. 

Mike pats himself, his face brightening as he rotates a shoulder. 

“You need to explain.” Sveta says, amused. 

Mike seems like he’s in his own little world. 

“Oh my god.” Mike begins, more to himself than us, “Before things went to shit for me…the first time, I was looking at filming a kid’s show. 

Never got past the pilot, producer had a heart attack, went into development hell, started a whole downward spiral. 

It was the last time things felt, normal. This my old costume, I remember how much of a pain in the ass it was to dye my hair this color.” Mike explains. 

Mike is actually grinning, teeth even and white. 

This might make me sound like an asshole, but I’m a full disclosure kind of guy.  I can’t help but be a little pissed off at his reaction. 

“My head is so clear.” The clown says with a chuckle, patting some of the pockets of his jacket, “Would have been nice if I still had my equipment. But, I prefer not having a dozen or so permanent injuries.”

As if to underline this statement Mike does a backflip. He completes the action with a casual grace that speaks to years of experience. 

Alex claps excitedly, in reply Mike flicks a white tipped walking stick, the end sprouting a small bouquet of fake flowers. She takes them reverently, as if she thinks the mail-order magic gimmick was real.  

“Glad you’re having a good time.” Leo says, his tone tells me he’s feeling the same way I am. 

“Honestly, yeah, pretty great.” Mike says. 

Sveta chuckles. 

“Which way do we go?” I ask, trying to move past Mike’s good luck. 

Sveta and Leo look to each other. 

“One direction seems as good as the next. No one who isn’t insane and corrupt from the journey knows much about this place. 

That being said, there is no ‘here’ all of this, is more of a test than a true location.” Sveta says. 

“I don’t disagree. 

We’re in uncharted waters. But if mad prophets and mushroom shaman can get to the city, why not us?” Leo’s tone has a bit of hope to it. 

And so, this last leg of our journey begins. 

Till now, I’ve been able to give you guys the gist of a lot of what we’ve been seeing. You all have read plenty of encounters from untold numbers of people, pretty much going over the same things. 

But here, I feel the need to get specific. If for no other reason than to get the word out there, maybe make things a bit safer for any of you who find yourselves accidentally in this place. 

Distances are tricky, those patches of flora we saw earlier, weren’t small patches of plant life on the horizon. They were massive masses, a half day’s travel away. 

A couple hours in I notice a small squeak coming from my left leg. At first I don’t think much of it, I’ve been banged around for over a half year now. 

But then again, while I’m no Kaz, this second-hand body of mine has repaired most minor injuries over time. 

Thankfully Leo and his equipment ( or the concept of his equipment…god this stuff hurts my brain.) made it through. We take turns using a pair of reflection-free binoculars to observe the area. 

Things don’t get any less strange, let’s just say that. 

There is wildlife, we see brief flashes of movement from the edges of the patches of plant filled land. But nothing seems to want to make itself known just yet. 

The other groups, those pilgrims to this dark mecca consist mostly of the types of people you’d think would be screwing around with the void. Lunatics dressed in erratic cult-like garb, screaming to the gods they think are listening. 

But the rest…

We see groups of confused people, teenagers mostly. Obviously wearing the scars of violence and hardship. Going into this with foreknowledge and the backing of a crew of folks who are immersed in the paranormal, is scary enough. I couldn’t imagine what it would be like being here by accident. 

The clouds overhead begin to fade, bringing about what I will call ‘night’ . 

“So choices look like scabby forest, or wiggling swamp. Either way I want to make camp before it gets much darker.” Leo says.

“Nothing good has ever happened in a swamp.” I offer. 

The ground is covered in a thick layer of loam. The trees around us sweat a crimson liquid that slowly hardens as it reaches their onyx colored trunks. 

“I’ve brought enough MREs to last us a couple of weeks, but I think it’d be a good idea to figure out what we can eat and drink around here. 

It’s probably a bit insensitive, but….” Leo starts to sound uncomfortable. 

Thankfully Sveta saves him. 

“None of the wildlife smell toxic to me. There’s a stream a few hours ahead, not sure about it though. There are a lot of strange wafts here.” She says, calming the flush rising on Leo’s face. 

We walk by bushes made of a fleshy, grey substance. Leo has to cut his way through yellow vines that try to constrict around his black steel machete.  Eventually we find a small clearing, the short grass feels like it’s vibrating slightly. 

The bone-like wood on the ground takes ages to catch a flame, despite being dry enough to nearly crumble. When it does, it burns with a nasty hissing noise. 

Mike, Leo, Sveta and Alex cook military grade food over the dull fire. 

“Anyone else notice the total lack of wildlife?” Mike asks, preparing the dried, dehydrated food. 

“They’re here, just giving us a wide berth.” Sveta says, confidently.

“That worry you as much as it does me?” Leo asks. 

“If they were scattering, no. But things are keeping their distance.” Sveta replies. 

“Watching us?” I ask. 

“Maybe.” Sveta answers. 

The later it gets the more I notice the noises. Just out of sight. 

Not needing to sleep I offer to take watch. Everyone else, exhausted as they are, gladly oblige. 

Once my companions begin to snore, the things around us get brave. Maybe they see me as nothing more than an old doll. Or they just don’t think I’m a threat. 

Something sticks it’s head out from behind a tree.  It’s head is deer-like, but the nose is too round, it’s eyes moving too quickly. Two feet of neck stretch, then twist at a nearly 90 degree angle to look directly at me. 

If I had a heart, it’d be beating out of my chest. The thing opens it’s mouth, a toothless, deep stoma. 

I debate waking Leo up. I have no idea what this thing is, or can do. 

But I don’t have to. 

Mike retches loud enough to send the Deersnake back into the forest. I look over, he’s on his hands and knees, eyes bloodshot, look of panic on his face. 

“Mike, what’s wrong?” I type. 

He retches again, nearly hitting the ground in pain. Leo, Sveta and Alex start to groggily rise. 

A third noise is cut off, almost muffled. Mike’s breathing becomes panicked and strained. 

He tries to scream, he can’t make a sound, but we all see it. Something in his mouth, cloth-like and glowing green. 

Mike’s body convulses as a half foot of the substance wrenches its way free. 

“No way that’s what I think it is.” Leo says, trying to blink away the remnants of sleep. 

“No, that’s ectoplasm. It’s got that cheese-cloth look to it.” Sveta says, confused and worried.  

In the embers of the fire I see blood vessels start to bulge in Mike’s eyes. The clown violently constricts into the fetal position, as the glowing mass drags itself out further. 

“Help him!” Alex screams, surprisingly lucidly. 

“I wouldn’t know where to start. Ectoplasm, it’s a very old way of doing things. Hasn’t been used in a century or so , hasn’t been popular for a century before that.” Leo says, panicked. 

One corner of the substance forms into a vaguely hand-like shape, pulling an impossible mass of itself from Mike. 

A blood vessel bursts tinting one eye a pale red. The clown starts to thrash, suffocating. 

I freak out, running to Mike, and trying to drag whatever the hell this is out of him. My hand passes through as if it was fog. 

The glowing mass extending from Mike’s mouth is about the volume of a comforter at this point. Vague shapes of bones and organs flash briefly in it’s amorphous form. 

Mike’s skin is turning blue in the light of the fire and the glow of the ectoplasm. He can’t go on much longer. 

Blood and vomit come from Mike’s mouth as the mass moves forward, I hear him take a quick, stifled breath. 

“Ride it out!” Leo screams. 

The mass makes a terrible wailing, Sveta covers her ears in pain. 

With one final grasping motion the ectoplasm rips itself free, the last trailing remnants looking like a combination of a torn sheet and a tadpole’s tail. 

The form begins to rise, never quite leaving the ground, but seeming to glide. A film of ectoplasm, with something trying to take shape beneath. 

Sveta and Leo rush over to Mike and Myself, Alex seems enthralled with the ghostly form that’s moving to disappear into the forest. 

 Mike is exhausted, dazed and hurt. Saliva, and other bodily fluids pour from his mouth as he tries to get to his hands and knees. 

He’s trying to say something, but his damaged throat strangles the sound. 

Wood in the fire pops, Leo and Sveta move closer. 

Barely audible, we hear Mike, “…Kill him.”.

Leo doesn’t ask questions and draws a large revolver. The Ectoplasmic mass is too far into the thick forest though. The rounds blow dripping chunks out of alien trees. 

Mike makes it through the night, he’s hurt, but being the walking wounded is par for the course for us. 

Daylight comes like a light switch. One moment we are in darkness, the next the forest around us is as illuminated as it is going to get. 

“Was that what I think it was?” Leo asks, half way through a breakfast ration that looks like a pop tart that actively hated the consumer. 

“It’s got to be. First time in forever I don’t hear him.” Mike says, almost ashamed. Each word causes him pain. 

“That’s great, a pissed off Jack the Ripper on our ass.” Leo replies. 

“We’ve been down this road. Let’s not start going at each other. None of us know what’s going to happen here.” Sveta says, smothering the spark of conflict. 

It makes me think of something. 

Things have lead here. I know, it’s a generic statement, but let me explain. 

None of this is an accident, if we all just met up yesterday and were tossed into this, we’d be dead by now. Our journey to this point, has given us what we need to get through this. 

I hope. 

When we get to the stream, the water has a thick consistency that no one is willing to chance. But between what Leo brought and a large bottle of seltzer Mike finds himself with, that won’t be a problem for a few more days. 

Miles of slightly rolling plains, nothing to do by try and get a handle on what this place is all about. 

Leo stops dead, pointing something out in the distance. 

With the naked eye, it looks like a police vehicle. Black and white patterning, a small cloud of disturbed dust pluming behind it. But as Leo passes around the binoculars, things get strange. 

The vehicle is low, and wide, moving not much faster than a brisk jog. It’s cobbled together from scraps of wood, tin and wire, roughly painted to give the police car impression. 

We can see others in the distance, they seem to be drawn to the groups of wanderers. 

   “Can’t say I like the looks of that.” Sveta says, handing the binoculars back to Leo. 

“Problem for another day I guess, but keep your head on a swivel. Anyone lunatic enough to try and live here, isn’t someone we want to encounter.” Leo says as we continue our trip through this cousin of purgatory. 

We’ve picked out another island of plant life to make camp. Long grasses, scrub, and what looks to be a pond making a more inviting spot than the forest. 

Not far from us a group of about 6 people make their own path through this desolate realm. Too far to pick out details, or worry about, we simply observe our fellow travelers as we walk. 

They are our first examples of how harsh this place can be. 

There’s a slight tremor, the tiny rocks under our feet starting to shift and vibrate. 

Being used to the universe coming at us from every angle our group reacts like a well oiled machine, searching for the threat. 

We weren’t the ones that needed to worry.

Beside the other group, the ground starts to sink. A trench suddenly starting to appear, about a half kilometer long. 

The group tries to run, but the sinking gravel around them slows their pace, makes some fall. 

Slowly, tentatively, the tip of a massive, finger-like protrusion prods it’s way from the sand, followed by five more. It’s met by a second set of six, clawing, prodding, many-jointed digits. It looks almost like two massive hands. 

  The trench widens, all of this is happening miles off, but a stench of wet leaves and rust hits us. 

The panicked group scatters, luck is on the side of 4 of them. 

One massive digit pins a young man. He squirms like an insect as he’s dragged into the trench. 

The trench itself is too much for his companion. A similarly aged woman in a torn overcoat. She staggers, stumbles, and within seconds disappears in the widening hole. 

We dub this event a “Grasping”, and before we hit the next island of plants we observe two more off in the distance. 

My leg has taken to seizing every few minutes. I’m able to hide it from everyone, but I’m also noticing the plates of my skull aren’t connecting quite flush. Arid air enters from the gaps. 

Not having to worry about something creepy behind every tree sounded like a great idea. But as we sit around a small, struggling fire made from twigs and grass we all feel exposed. 

“How in the hell did you get those?” Leo asks as Sveta rejoins us. 

She holds eight small, furred lumps by long , thin, black tails. I can’t see any eyes, or ears,  but judging by the blood dripping from them, they were alive at one point. 

“Girl’s got to have some secrets.” Sveta replies, dodging the question. 

Leo begins to prepare the creatures, looking confused and often asking Sveta what parts can be eaten. 

“Alex, how are you holding up?” Mike asks. 

Overhead I see no stars, but every so often a lattice of red light pulses. 

“Still confused, but so is everyone else.” She says with a morbid grin. 

Mike laughs. 

“Who are you hearing?” The clown says, surprisingly bluntly. 

“No one.” Alex says, clearly lying. 

“I call mine Psycho and the Boyscout.” Mike offers. 

Alex looks suspicious. 

“Emily.” Alex admits, “It’s not like she talks to me, more like…”

“You’re hearing her thoughts? But they’re thoughts about the things you are going through, right?” Mike finishes for her. 

She looks curious and nods. 

“We’ll talk more later.” Mike says reassuringly, “I think we have some things in common.”

Mike’s comment catches my attention. I’ve been noticing his interest in some of the things Alex has been rambling about lately. 

As we collect our things the next morning we get a close up view of one of those strange vehicles as well as it’s driver. 

Leo and Mike are on edge as the cobbled together conveyance slowly pulls up. No engine growl, or electric whine, but as it makes it’s way to us I swear I hear muffled screaming and pleading. 

The man who exits is massive, dressed in a cobbled together mess that has the barest hints of a police uniform. A beaten brass star hangs tenuously from a disintegrating leather jacket. 

“Who might you be?” Leo asks, walking toward the man. 

“Sargent Martin. I represent the lost. We keep order in the wastes. As such, we collect a tax from those who enter.” The massive man says. 

Before Leo talks, Mike looks to him and says, “Easy, we don’t need any trouble.”

Leo visibly softens his expression. 

“What kind of a tax are you looking for, Sargent?” Leo asks. 

“Your pistol, and your clown friend’s coat.” Sargent Martin replies. 

Mike takes his coat off with a flourish, before he can offer it though Leo blocks him with one arm. 

“We’re passing through and not looking for any trouble. 

But that being said, if you want to try and extort us? I’d bring a lot more mall-cops.” Leo remains calm, but there’s no room for debate in his tone. 

There’s a long silence. Eventually Sergeant Martin shrugs. 

“Fair enough. This time we are asking for our due. Next time we will be telling you what we are taking.” The sergeant says, entering the vehicle.  

More miles, more sights of things that never were. We notice shimmering tiny birds flitting through the low-hung clouds, and what looks like rising smoke far in the distance. 

 Personally I’m noticing the fact my leg is basically dragging. I can’t hide it anymore, but no one mentions it. 

It feels, itchy, hollow. 

Sveta notices it a second before the rest of us. Her body freezes for a moment, “Run!”, she screams. 

We all know to trust each other, everyone obeys without question. 

But I’m distracted, tiny, and losing mobility. Leo realizes this, and starts to turn. 

“Keep going, I’ve got this!” I yell. Not willing to drag the hunter into my fate. 

It’s obvious what’s happening, a ‘Grasping’. Green sand starts to drag me backward. 

I can climb a pane of glass, but there’s nothing to climb as the sand around me turns into a waterfall to god knows where. 

Beside me, blindly prodding, one of those massive digits begins to dig into the sand. 

I don’t dare look back. I can practically feel the power and evil of whatever lives beneath the sand. 

Something starts to fall, a large rock. I push myself to my limit more swimming than climbing the pit forming around me. 

I manage to grab a hold of it, trying to use it to get to solid ground before it’s completely washed away. 

I hear the snap before I feel it. Like a rotten twig my leg severs. Disintegrating cloth and rusted gears spin into the void below. 

I couldn’t help but watch. 

The sight of the thing below makes me freeze, desperately clinging to the rock. 

The scale gets me, it’s a massive thing, lost in the dark cavern around it. A massive, body, blocks wide and god knows how deep. 

But the face. 

It was twisted, hateful. Eyes, disturbingly human glare at me. Nothing but rage at something that dared exist, when it was stranded in this universal storage closet. 

It makes no noise, but all the same seems to be speaking. Features like an aged fetus seem to squirm, desperate for it’s next meal. It’s next act of revenge.  

The rock below me gives way, a deeper fear than I’ve felt takes hold. This has to be the end. 

“On your three!” I hear Mike scream. 

My brain is working in overdrive, I look up, seeing Leo laying on the ground, extended as far as he can be on the retreating sand. 

I have no idea what Mike has in mind, but I have to act, in another quarter second I’ll be in free fall. And who knows what happens if we die here. 

What I do can’t be described as a jump, more of a desperate, one legged slide fueled by fading magic and fear. 

But it gives me a couple of feet of lateral distance. Enough time to see Mike running across Leo’s back. 

I see what he’s going to try, and with his body no longer half made of scar tissue, I hope he can pull it off. 

But I see a problem. My hands are ceramic, and tiny. Maybe Mike is able to grab me, if not, I’m not going to have a chance to help. 

Fear makes people act in selfish ways. At least that’s how I want to frame what I do next. 

I replace one hand with a blade as I feel my momentum start to stall. 

Mike swan dives from Leo’s shoulders extending one arm toward me. Leo grabs him by the ankle, I hear a pop, and see a wince of pain in Mike’s face. 

I see it now, the angle is wrong. By the time I start falling, I’ll be plenty close, but Mike won’t have a grip. 

“Sorry!” I scream. I know Mike won’t understand, but I feel like shit. 

I manage to slow myself on one sleeve, the bunching fabric letting me leave Mike with a garish tear wound rather than a permanent injury. 

Mike screams, Leo pulls us all up. Mike Keeps holding me until the sinkpit behind us is out of sight. 

The situation leaves us all shaking and dazed. Up close, that thing in the pit, was soul crushing. 

Mike snaps off a quarter of his walking stick, making me a makeshift cane. We continue our journey, but here is where I think I’m going to leave you guys. 

I thought I’d seen it all, that we’d seen it all. But this place, it’s bigger, stranger and more unique than anything we’ve dealt with before. 

I thank everyone who has kept on this journey with me so far. We are steps away from stopping the bishop, if anyone has any help, any knowledge of where I am or what I can do. It’d be much appreciated, let me know in the comments. 

Till next time. For all of you that don’t like me. 

I guess I’m finally taking your advice and going to hell. 

Punch.
