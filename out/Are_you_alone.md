This happened a few years ago now, but I still remember it a little too vividly. 

Some backstory... 

I used to work as a front desk agent at a hotel while i was in college. Since a few people had quit, I was occasionally asked to do the night audit shift (11 pm - 7 am). At first, it was a pretty easy job where I did work for like an hour and then had to find creative ways to stay awake. There were occasionally creepy sounds and whatnot, but even though no one else worked with me, nothing really bothered me (with the exception of a freaking fax that came from the hot tub between 4 and 5 am to tell me the chlorine level was too high, that scared the hell out of me the first time).

Main story..

After doing this a few months, I had grown pretty comfortable with it until one night. At around 1 a.m., I got a phone call, which was very unusual. Since it was so late, I didn't bother to check if it was coming from a room or if it was an external number since I assumed that it was a guest that needed something. This was the conversation:

Me: "Hello, this is OP. How can I help you?"
Caller: "Are you working alone?"
Me: "Yes sir,  I do the night audit. How can I help you?"
Caller (with a lower almost sensual voice): "Mmm, good. I'm lonely too, can you keep me company?"
Me: "Sorry sir, but I am still working."

Caller hangs up.

I was pretty creeped out after I saw that the call came from OUTSIDE the hotel. I was on the second floor dropping off bills to guests when the call happened. I then couldn't remember if I had locked the front door and started psyching myself out. I immediately bolted down the hallway to get downstairs to try and check when the phone rang again. I picked it up, and this was the entire conversation:

Me: "Front desk, how can I help you?"
Caller: "I'm still here if you're lonely."
Me (getting anxious): "Sorry, but I need to work -"
Caller: "Mmmm. How about you do some work for me?"

I hung up and double-checked all the doors to ensure they were locked. After ensuring that I was at least locked in, I paced around for a while, trying to figure out what to do. I didn't know who to call or what to do since the exchnages between the caller and I would spund ridiculous or made up to someone else. After sitting and shaking for a while, I finally called the police. The responder was super helpful and said that these calls are actually somewhat common (which sounds more terrifying to me).

Later on, the police came through the premises twice that night and luckily found nothing. I had no trouble staying up that night. When my manager saw me the next day when I got off shift, I couldn't even tell him what happened since it was so terrifying. I did, however, stop doing night audit.
