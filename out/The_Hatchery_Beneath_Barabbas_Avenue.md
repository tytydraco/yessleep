Barabbas Avenue was more of a scar than a street. Drowned in flickering neon and half-choked by the stench of moldy newspapers, its buildings hulked like diseased teeth in a sagging gum. At midnight—though it was hard to trust your senses in that perennial twilight—Andrew “Dusty” Zadrozny found himself kneeling behind a vandalized mailbox, fighting an urge to retch as he watched the old Post Office’s door sway in the wind. Something behind it seemed to breathe, exhaling the same rank odor that soaked into the city’s neglected core.

He didn’t want to be here. Not really. He’d spent a lifetime stuffing his brain with conspiratorial babble—lurid broadcast signals about secret genetics labs and unholy alliances formed under defunct Cold War treaties. But tonight, a scab-scratching stranger, whose lips peeled back in a donkey-like grin, had hissed, “They’re tunneling under your skin, brother. It’s all rotting under your skin.” Then he’d scratched so hard that the wound bled, and a dark, unidentifiable fluid oozed onto his fingernails. A sight that unmoored Dusty from the false comfort of rationality.

Stepping to the battered Post Office doorway, he braced himself for the smell—a putrid cocktail that was half old adhesives, half rancid meat. The door squealed open. This place had been abandoned for years, supposedly due to asbestos hazards. Now, amid the scabbed tile floor and splintered mail counters, Dusty caught a whiff of something else—cloying chemicals, iodine perhaps, underscored by the copper tang of blood.

He passed ranks of obsolete mail sorters. They reminded him of a once-robust bureaucracy, now gutted and left to rot. But conspiracies feed on rot. He was an unwilling disciple of that truth. Toward the back, a pale fluorescent light spilled through a chipped metal door marked “Authorized Personnel Only.” He considered turning around—he could still bolt, fade into the sleepless city, pretend none of this existed. Yet a malignant pull dragged him forward, the stranger’s words echoing: rotting under your skin.

The door opened onto a cramped stairwell leading down. Every step resounded like a funeral knell. The temperature dropped. Strange liquids pooled in the corners, congealed black masses that might have been old tar or something more biologically unsettling. His stomach churned. By the time he reached the sub-basement corridor, a wave of claustrophobia assaulted him. Above, the overhead bulbs flickered in syncopated pulses, the hallway going from half-light to darkness like a failing heartbeat.

At the far end, behind a wide window, silhouettes danced under a surgical glow. Dusty flattened himself against the wall, inching closer. The glass was filthy, but he could see into what must once have been a mail-sorting annex, now converted into a makeshift operating theater. Flickering overhead lamps illuminated an old metal table. On that table, strapped down in black belts, was something shaped vaguely like a human—except lumps bulged beneath the skin, writhing as if alive. Two figures wearing tattered lab coats hovered at the edges, manipulating tubes and syringes bristling with unidentifiable fluids. One substance was a deep, iridescent black, coiling in the IV line like a living creature.

A rancid wave of fear crested in Dusty’s throat. Body horror had always seemed like an abstract idea from B-grade movies, but here it was, intimately real. The lumps under the strapped figure’s flesh squirmed in unison, as if responding to the doctors’ manipulations. He pressed his ear against a crack in the wall.

“…heart rate up again,” whispered the tall, skeletal doctor. “It rejects sedation.”

The shorter doctor, broad-shouldered, rummaged for something glinting under the bright lights—a savage-looking clamp or hook. “We have no choice but to proceed. We open, we excise… or it hatches.”

Dusty nearly choked. Hatches? The lumps moved like they were about to force themselves out. He clenched his fists until his nails cut into his palms. Every fiber of his being screamed to leave, but a viler curiosity urged him to discover more. If he turned away now, nightmares would devour him for the rest of his life—and these experiments would continue in the dark. He exhaled shakily and slid farther down the corridor, noticing a metal door with a red hazard sign. Behind it, maybe answers.

He stepped inside a small, claustrophobic room. Filing cabinets teetered, their drawers disgorging papers stamped with “Department of Defense” or “Paraclete S – Confidential.” Flickers of a conspiracy older than he could fathom. On a battered steel desk lay a single folder, recently disturbed. Its label read: “Project Paraclete – Specimen 16C – Tissue Escalation Protocol.” He flipped it open with trembling hands.

The first page was a memo:

Dusty’s vision swam. He skimmed polaroid photographs attached by a paperclip. They depicted a progression: a man with a terrified expression, next with lumps swelling his arms, and finally an image that made Dusty’s insides curdle—dozens of insectile eyes pressed beneath the man’s shoulder skin, the surface transparent enough to reveal them blinking in tandem.

A moan from the adjoining room cut the silence, making Dusty jump. He stuffed the folder under his jacket. Another door at the back of the file room led into darkness. Before he could investigate, the lights sputtered, plunging the corridor into near-blackness. He braced himself against a cabinet, heart pounding.

A scraping footstep behind him. The overhead light flared, revealing a figure with a scalpel. It was the short doctor, mask askew, revealing cheeks riddled with shallow punctures—some filled with scabby black fluid. He came at Dusty with manic force. Dusty ducked, letting the blade shriek across the filing cabinet. Sparks flew, singeing the stale air with an ozone tang.

“We can help you,” the doctor muttered, voice wet with desperate mania. “What’s under your skin… we can fix it.”

Dusty slammed a shoulder into the man’s chest. The folder threatened to spill from his jacket. The doctor staggered, but his speed was inhuman, fueled by an unholy obsession. He slashed again. Dusty managed to wedge a rusted stool between them and lunge for the corridor.

He tore up the stairs, chest burning. The old Post Office came into view—yellowed walls, broken counters, the main door an unsteady rectangle of sickly moonlight. Behind him, footsteps hammered on the metal steps. He crashed through the front door into the damp city air. The short doctor appeared at the threshold but stopped as if tethered by unseen wires, or perhaps reluctant to leave the safe womb of his subterranean horrors. His eyes glowed with furious hunger.

Dusty sprinted, breath ragged, not daring to glance back.

In a cramped, second-floor walk-up, lit only by the hiss of neon filtering through heavy curtains, Dusty unloaded his story to his friend Catalina. She was an artist with a mania for collage and an equally fervid taste for illicit knowledge. Her apartment was a swirl of half-finished paintings, greasy pizza boxes, and the mild chemical tang of old paint thinner. The overhead light flickered, revealing stacks of occult pamphlets, half-dissected shortwave radios, and homemade stencils that read “SUBLIMINAL WARFARE.”

He showed her the Paraclete documents. She paced in a circle, muttering curses in multiple languages, hair fraying out of her bun. “Dusty, do you see these lumps? They’re—God, they look like cocoons. Or eggs.” Her voice wavered on that last word. “They’re growing inside people. Alive.”

Dusty felt a creeping itch behind his own ear. The memory of the lab’s stench clung to him like a second skin. “Some gene-splicing experiment. They… fuse arthropod DNA, but it’s not from any known insect. The sedation just speeds it up.”

She nodded grimly. “We can’t exactly go to the cops with this, can we?” The city was rife with hush-hush briberies, elected officials turning a blind eye in exchange for hush money from black-budget labs.

“Then we blow it wide open on our own,” he said, surprising even himself with the resolve in his voice. “We get real proof—photos, video. If we can record them in the act, the story goes viral. They can’t silence the entire internet.”

Catalina rummaged through a battered trunk in the corner, retrieving a camera with a telephoto lens and a pair of night-vision goggles, relics from a guerilla art piece she’d staged on an abandoned water tower. Dusty swallowed hard, a sick excitement tangling with dread.

They arrived in a borrowed van at two in the morning. The back streets around the Post Office were a labyrinth of dripping alleys and flickering street lamps. The building squatted like a tumor. Dusty killed the engine, hearing the faint hum of distant machinery. For half an hour, nothing stirred. Then a black SUV pulled up, headlights extinguished. Four men dragged out a tarp-wrapped bundle, suspiciously body-shaped, into the building.

“That’s our cue,” Catalina murmured, adjusting the night-vision goggles.

They slipped through a side entrance, the emergency door’s latch broken. If Dusty expected the interior to remain silent, he was disabused by a rhythmic clank from deep below. Like monstrous hearts beating, or industrial machinery devouring flesh. With each step, the air grew more claustrophobic.

Eventually, they reached a grated metal walkway overlooking the sub-basement. The annex was fully lit now. Six people in lab coats circled a new gurney. The tarp was peeled away to expose a woman’s body. Much of her abdomen looked bruised, flesh stretched taut. Blood seeped from an incision that ran from sternum to pelvis, crudely sutured, as if the doctors had tried to keep something from erupting too soon.

Catalina lifted her camera. Dusty forced himself to watch through the grate. The woman’s eyes fluttered with vague awareness. When one of the doctors prodded her belly, she let out a soft keening moan that echoed painfully off the walls.

“Extract the cluster,” snapped a tall, gaunt man, presumably the lead scientist. Two assistants, gloved to the elbow, moved in with surgical tools that looked more like butcher’s hooks. They cut away the sutures. Her flesh peeled open, exposing black lumps within her cavity—gleaming in the overhead light like wet charcoal. A vile stench rose in a visible haze.

Catalina’s camera clicked. Dusty fought the urge to vomit as the lumps—egg-like spheres—shimmered with a liquid sheen. Vein-like filaments spidered across their surfaces. Then the lumps began to move.

A tearing sound, wet and jagged. The woman screamed, high-pitched and raw. Something inside her chest cavity was forcing itself free. Folds of muscle and organ parted, revealing a chitinous limb, spindly and jointed, hooking at the air. A second limb followed, the exoskeleton glistening with the woman’s blood. The doctors backed away in a mixture of horror and fascination.

Then the torso burst. Viscera and half-formed tissue spattered across the gurney, spraying the lab coats with gore. A creature, roughly the size of a newborn, squirmed out. It resembled an obscene cross between a crustacean and an insect larva, with multiple segmented legs and a cluster of black, lidless eyes that darted in every direction. A shriek filled the room as it snapped open a concentric ring of needle-like teeth.

Dusty clapped a hand over his mouth. The air reeked of copper and excrement. At the gurney’s edge, the woman gurgled. Her entire rib cage had been wrenched apart. She was impossibly still alive, her eyes rolling white with agony. One of the doctors barked orders to secure the “specimen,” but the creature launched itself off the gurney, limbs scrabbling. An assistant collapsed, screaming, as it latched onto his face. A sickening crunch followed, bone giving way to gnashing mandibles.

Catalina’s breath hitched. She continued snapping pictures, the camera’s shutter a frantic staccato. Dusty tugged on her sleeve, terrified they’d be seen. But it was already too late. The creature’s array of eyes seemed to pivot, focusing upward through the grate. At the same time, one of the doctors pointed, roaring, “Intruders! Shoot them!”

Bullets hissed past. Dusty and Catalina ducked, adrenaline exploding in their veins. He tore down the walkway, dragging her along. Sparks ricocheted from the metal railings. Behind them, the sub-basement erupted in pandemonium—doctors screeching, the monstrous spawn hissing, more gunshots clanging.

“Go, go!” Dusty shouted, lungs on fire. They found the corridor that led back to the main floor. One bullet whizzed so close he felt the heat on his ear. When they burst into the ground-level hall, they staggered to the side exit. Catalina pounded the crash bar, and the door gave way with a shriek of twisted metal. They spilled onto the asphalt behind the building, hearts in their throats.

Dusty rammed a piece of broken rebar through the door handle. Inside, a cacophony of shrieks crescendoed. It sounded like the doctors were losing control of their own abomination. Good, he thought, though the victory felt as hollow and rancid as the air.

They fled to the van, oblivious to everything but escape. The ride home was a blur, each streetlight a grim interrogation lamp, each passing alley a potential ambush. At Catalina’s apartment, they barricaded the door with a bookshelf and sank onto the floor.

They examined the camera. The images left no room for doubt: the transformation, the monstrous birth. There was enough evidence to sink an empire. Catalina emailed encrypted copies to a half-dozen underground journalists she knew, each one a sworn enemy of corporate and governmental cover-ups. By dawn, the story would be unstoppable.

Yet Dusty couldn’t summon relief. Exhausted, he drifted to the bathroom sink. His hands trembled as he splashed water on his face. When he lifted his head, he glanced at himself in the mirror. His reflection was chalk-pale, eyes bloodshot, but something else drew his attention: a faint lump beneath the skin on the right side of his neck. Like a small marble, tender to the touch.

He prodded it gently, biting back a gasp. Something inside shifted, wriggled—a subtle, loathsome movement beneath his flesh. His mind replayed the memory of the scab-scratching stranger’s words: “It’s rotting under your skin… we can fix it.” Perhaps that stranger was more than just a harbinger; maybe he’d been infected already, a walking testament to this plague.

Dusty felt an impulse to grab a knife and cut the lump out before it could blossom into the horror he’d witnessed in the lab. His heart pounded in his skull, and the reflection in the mirror wavered, as though another pair of eyes—mottled, insectile—glared back at him from within his own face.

“Cat…” he croaked, voice trembling. He heard her stirring in the next room, but she didn’t come. The hush in the apartment seemed saturated with dread. Outside, sirens wailed as early morning gloom settled over the city. Shadows danced on the walls, flickering like ephemeral wings.

Dusty pressed his fingers deeper into the lump, feeling a small pop of pressure. A slick warmth trickled along his neck—blood. His stomach lurched. If there was an egg, or a larval chamber, or something even more abominable, had it already merged with his tissue?

Behind him, the faucet dripped, each drop echoing the unstoppable countdown of something monstrous. He closed his eyes, remembering the woman on the gurney, her chest cavity a ruptured cradle for a vile new life. The memory of that chittering creature, black eyes spinning to meet his own.

He clung to the faint hope that the photos would be enough, that shining a searing light on these horrors would prompt the entire world to rise up against them. But in that moment, with the slow trickle of blood creeping under his collar, it felt like no matter how wide they threw open the gates of truth, some nightmares had already seeded themselves too deeply.

Dusty wrenched off the tap. The final drops beat out a rhythm of dread: drip… drip… drip. He pressed his palm against the lump on his neck, forcing it down, but feeling it pulse back against his hand.

He closed his eyes tight. No going back now. The only question remaining was how much time he had left…before the horror hatching beneath his own skin demanded to be born.
