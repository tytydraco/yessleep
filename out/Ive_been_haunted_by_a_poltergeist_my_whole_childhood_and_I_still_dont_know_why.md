Hello all. This is kind of a long story, but in honor of spooky season coming up, I figured I’d finally tell it. The only person I’ve told this to was family that witnessed it and a therapist. 

This started when I was 2 years old, back before my parents got divorced. We had a small, old house in a mediocre neighborhood in NC. We had been living there for about a year at this time. I obviously was not old enough to remember details, so this is my parents and older brothers (who was 6-7 at the time) rendition of the story. 

My mom was making dinner in the kitchen, which directly faced the hallway where I was playing with toys and entertaining myself- or so she thought. All of a sudden I start screaming crying and ran up to her and wrapped my body around her leg. She said I was looking at the hallway with so much fear that she STILL hasn’t seen me as scared as I was in that moment. When she looked in the hallway and saw nothing, she asked me what was wrong. I replied “there’s a man in the hallway mommy.” Thinking it was my older brother scaring me, she rolled her eyes and started walking to his room in the hallway, already scolding him. She stopped in front of his room when she noticed he wasn’t there. She looked out the living room window and saw him and my dad riding bikes. 

“Honey, what does the man look like?” She asks me. I replied “He’s all black” which she then clarified that I was trying to say, in my 2 year old speech, that he was wearing all black. She asks, “what’s his name?”. I paused and then looked back up and said “pawpaw”. The only grandfather or even great grandfather that had died at the time was my mom’s dad, who died when she was 13. We’d never met him. She looks confused, and I think she wondered herself if it was her dad coming to see me, so she asks “what does his face look like.” I responded  “he has no face.” Freaked out, she scooped me up and took me to play with my dad and brother. 

After that day, I’d randomly start talking to “nothing” in my room or in the hallway. I’d look up at this thing, giggle and laugh, and chase it around. When I was 3, I chased it into the kitchen one day, and my mom asked me who I was talking to. “Pawpaw!” I replied. My mom asked, “can I talk to pawpaw?” She said my eyes followed something out of the window, in the way that they only do when something is actually moving (like when you’re looking out at the trees in a moving car). I replied “no, he flew out of the window!” With a smile on my face and not a care in the world. 

It was around that time that weird stuff started happening to my older brother. He was in the shower on day and my parents were in the living room, just feet away. They heard the noise of the shower curtain ripping back rapidly mixed with my brother screaming bloody murder. They ran in there, terrified something had happened, only for my brother to tell them that he saw the shadow of a very large hand sway across the curtain before it got ripped back. When they were consoling him, they heard me giggling in the doorway. They asked me what was so funny, and I responded “my pawpaws playing with you!” And ran off. This experience scared my brother so bad, he wouldn’t take a shower by himself for a whole year and had my dad sit on the toilet when he was in there. Even as a grown up and now 23, he still talks about how terrifying it was. 

Around this time, my mom also started experiencing things. We had an unfinished basement where the laundry was. There was an old wooden rocking horse down there, and our little Boston terrier would hangout there if he got tired of running around. One day, he started barking and wouldn’t stop for 10 minutes, which mom said was unusual. When she went down there to see what he was barking at, he was barking in the direction of the rocking horse… which was ROCKING VIGOROUSLY. On its own. 

The last straw before they decided to move was when I was playing with “Pawpaw” outside of my door, with my body facing in the door. I was throwing things in my room and laughing. My mom, again was in the kitchen cooking. I threw a bouncy ball in there. My mom heard it bounce from my throw and then come to a stop, and I giggled. Then a few minutes later, she heard the ball bounce again… back towards me from the doorway, as if someone had thrown it. She turned around, shocked, and saw my face slowly turn from a smile to a terrified scream and sob. She ran and scooped me up, and took me and my brother to her mom’s house. On the way she called my dad who was at work at the EMS base. When she told him what happened, his buddy and co-worker said he wasn’t surprised, since the first call he had ever run was at our house. When asked what call it was, he explained that it had been an older man that had shot himself in the basement years back. 

We moved a few months after that and I never once mentioned any pawpaw or anything like that ever again. It still freaks me out that I can remember some details and moments in that house so clearly, but I have no memory of this “thing” that was attached to me.
