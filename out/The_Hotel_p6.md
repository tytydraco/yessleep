August 1st:
So sorry for not updating in so long but not much has happened, things have been somewhat calm.

A girl named Elise started working here, not to sure what she does though just seems to hover, maybe she’s night shift and just hangs out here? Who knows.

I realized I had a few spelling errors in my last entry, I’ll work on it sorry to whoever may be reading this.

Oh! Victor just stormed in the other day with his goons of psychos, how they got here who knows but he demanded that we started supplying him with 10lbs of ramen? Like what the fuck, who wants,has,or needs 10lbs of ramen.
Oh and the best part if we did give it to him the “reckoning” would come a pawn us, we just through him out and now I gotta new shiny accessory in case a “reckoning” appears orders from boss man himself.
My new toy is a 357. Snub nose for those wondering, kicks like a bitch tho. Again sorry for the short update and I will again soon.

August 3rd: Had to use my 357. Today, boss man had me clean room 107 on the 10th floor, didn’t know we had a 10th floor but duty calls.

The 10th floor is normal enough besides the puke green carpet, complimented by a piss stain yellow wall, walking down the hall gave me a funny feeling though, not like I was being watched just almost seemed like a dream, like reality is crashing at every moment.

I approached the door near the end of the hall reading the number 107, opening the door I see two octopus like tentacles just laying there surrounded by green blood, stepping further into the room and putting on a pair of gloves, sighing at my misfortune I pick up the arm? Leg? I don’t know the tentacle when it springs to life wrapping around my neck.

As I struggled to un suction the tentacles wrapped around my throat it slings and fights eventually throwing me on the floor 
But what I land on isn’t hard it’s quite slimy it took all of two second before realizing shits getting worse, grabbing my gun i put the barrel just under the arm in a way it wouldn’t hit me if it went through and pulled the trigger when the once puke color carpet turns into a color of green and red as the giant octopus un camouflages and let’s out a deafening screech.

Slowly stepping back I take aim and fire another shot hitting it in what I would call it’s stomach, when it grabs me by the feet faster then my mind could comprehend and throws me into the bathroom sending me crashing into the mirror slicing my back.

Groaning I pick myself up wincing at the pain and shoot the octopus 3 times in the upper area hoping to hit wherever it’s brain is when it finally flops, limping over I check my cylinder and see one unspent bullet, putting it to its eye I pulled the trigger.

I started picking up where I left off but this time it’s way more then just 2 arms, grabbing a saw I cut the giant beast into tinier bits and gave it to big boss, he just had me give it to the chef saying something about not letting food go to waste but honestly I lose Interest when he said sushi, just ew besides the fact of raw fish, I just put six lead holes into him it’s bound to get someone sick, or maybe the alien octo beast thing is poisoned so many factors, will update when something worth updating happens although I realize now that, that’s subjective since apparently my life is strange.
