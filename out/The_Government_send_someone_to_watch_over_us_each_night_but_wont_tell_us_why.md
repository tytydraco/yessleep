The government sent someone to watch over us each night, but didn’t tell us why

It started one night with a knock at the door. My parents, sister and I were getting ready to turn in for the night. “Who could that be at this hour?”, my dad asked with a puzzled look on his face. As the door opened, three large men dressed in all black were in our doorway. What was more sinister was the black hazmat masks tightly secured to their faces. “Who the hell are you?” My dad inquired. Not a word was said from our visitors. They pushed past him and each went into our bedrooms, one man for my parents room, one for my sister’s and one for mine.

“There are three men in my house. They refused to speak or leave! Send someone right away!” My dad screamed down the phone to the police, who seemed to not have an answer for him. “They are here to help”, they kept repeating to him. 

I couldn’t help but wonder who were these men in our house and why are they in our rooms. As my father was shouting at the police, I switched on the TV.

“Government sends all households overnight security” was on the headline. 
“This is free of charge” it added. “Do not attempt to engage with them.”

“But I don’t want them in my house, I have a family”, my dad pleaded with no avail. I suppose we’ll be hosting some new visitors for the next few nights

As I settled into bed, it was difficult to ignore the tall figure standing against the wall opposite my bed. The round black eyes of his mask were really unsettling. He didn’t speak or move. All I could hear were deep breathing sounds coming from the mask. At least he’s alive I suppose?

I turn on my side with my back away from him trying to fall asleep. How does one sleep with someone watching them in the darkness? Usually people fear what they cannot seen in the dark, however I know my visitor is there. I had so many questions. Why is he wearing the mask? What is he trying to protect himself from? I couldn’t fall asleep that night, with questions looming over my mind.

As the sun came up the next morning, I planted my feet on the floor as I rose from bed. The figure was still there, watching. When he had confirmation I was awake, he made his first movement all night- towards and out of the front door. I felt some ease as he left and wondered if he colleagues too had left with him.

At breakfast, my parents and I had the same unease. We still had one visitor in our home, watching over my sister. She was never one to rise early, and hopefully her watcher would get bored and leave. As 11am approached, her visitor opened the front door and left.

“Well that was weird”, she said as she emerged from her room. “What?” I asked her. “He just wouldn’t stop whispering to himself.”

My parents and I stopped what we were doing for a moment. Eyes fixed on my sister. “What did he say?” we asked collectively.

“She’s just a girl. She’s just a girl. She’s just a girl.” Over and over and over.
