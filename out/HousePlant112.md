I grabbed a bottle of cold water from my fridge, slightly struggling to twist the cap off as I walk back to my bedroom. The silence from midnight was loud. I entered my room to the sight of my dog and setup. Normally, I wouldn’t keep my dog in my room, I’d let her run free through as she pleases at night. I’ve never had any problems with it, and neither have my parents. I have a mom and a dad, an 11 year old brother and a 6 year old mute autistic sister. I sat down at my desk as I took a drink from the water bottle and set it down lightly on the coaster.
“Thanks everyone for tuning into the stream! Check in tomorrow for some more Fall Guys with me!” said my favorite streamer, HousePlant112, waving the camera off as he normally does every night. I went to sleep. I woke up in the middle of the night to a sound playing from my laptop. I slowly and carefully got up and walked towards my laptop, my heart pulsing in my ears. I opened my laptop, realizing I forgot to exit the Twitch tab after he ended it. My eyes adjusted to the screen. What the hell? Is he in my house? I jumped back as I watched my favorite streamer walk towards my sisters room. He was breathing heavily, but he didn’t show his face, which was even weirder, because he always shows his face. He slowly creaked open my sisters door, her blonde hair visibly peeking from the sheets. I watched HousePlant112 start drawing back the covers of my sisters bed, the camera panning over to the back of her upper foot. He shined his meat cleaver at the flash of the camera. He started petting my sisters foot with the cleaver. I sat there, my jaw on the floor. I could not move. HousePlant112 started slicing back and forth at my sisters tendons, she woke up and tried to scream. But she was mute. She couldn’t speak… HousePlant112 then started sawing at my sisters wrists, restraining her from getting up. Tears were streaming down her face, and I could do nothing but watch in pure horror as i watched my sister get cut alive, like a pig in a slaughterhouse. Her face was full of pain and agony, clearly yearning for death as he mercilessly painted her bedsheets with cold red blood. He started tapping her throat with the blade as he giggled and shushed her crying. He started cutting at her throat. Red liquid mixed with saliva was spewing from her neck as she gurgled, drowning in her own blood. He sat there, her severed and threaded on hands trying to close the wound in her throat. She could not grip her throat because the muscles in her hand wouldn’t work. He left her there, bleeding out. I started crying, but I still couldn’t move, I was stuck. Like I wasn’t even in control of my own body. HousePlant112 then moved to my brothers room, killing him disturbingly quicker, like he wanted to watch my sister nonverbally suffer. But he wanted to kill my brother fast? What the hell? I saw him move across the house, bloody cleaver in hand. He moved to my parents room and silently creeped up, slicing their wrists as they woke up, crying in agony. I watched, tears assaulting my face as i watched my entire family recieve agonizing deaths. My entire family, murdered in front of me. By my favorite streamer, Houseplant112. I snapped back to reality as I heard my mom’s final scream. As my door got kicked down by HousePlant112, I woke up. I immediately jumped up from the covers, running to my sisters room. The bedsheets were soiled with red, but there was no sign of Anna. I went to my brothers room, where a pool of blood lay, avoiding his bedsheets, but there was no sign of Braeden. I went to my parents room, and there they lay from under the bed, two ankles, sliced open. 5 arms sliced open. The limbs of my parents. And then I saw my fathers severed head, pierced on the bucks antler they found on their hike. He was foaming from the mouth, blue eyes, moldy skin. I heard loud footsteps, as I turn around, HousePlant112 is standing in front of me. With a disturbing smile on his face, he speaks words.
“Tune in next time!” He raises the cleaver up, then splits my face open. In my finals moments, I watch my body get lay under the bed with the rest of my family.
