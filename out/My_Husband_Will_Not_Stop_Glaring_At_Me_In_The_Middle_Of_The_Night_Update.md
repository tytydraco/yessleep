Prison. It's different than jail. I know first hand now. Dirty and cold, same could be said for the food and even for most of the others locked away here. 

But I kept my word. I turned myself in thinking it would end this. 

How foolish of me.

I need to backup to fully explain. 

As I said previously, I called and turned myself in days ago... or is weeks ago? Time doesn't seem to exist here. 

The cops walking me out of the hotel was so surreal. I was first booked into the local jail then moved to the state prison some days later to await trial.

I actually tried calling Jake after being moved here. I don't why I expected him to take the call or why I felt so much pain when he didn't. Surely, the cops had paid him a visit. Told him of my horrible confession. I've seen it myself that it was plastered all over the news.

The horrid girl who killed a local dementia-ridden elderly man in drunken hit and run. Driven mad by images of the man possessing her husband. 

Some speculated Jake knew and helped keep my awful crime hush hush. He has every right to never want to speak or see me again. 

Still, when the time came a few days ago that one of the guards told me I had a visitor, my heart jumped with joy at the thought it was Jake.

They cuffed me and walked me to hall lined with chairs and thick plexiglass. 

My heart jumped for a different reason when they sat me down infront of a woman. 

I immediately recognized her. I had seen her on the news when the accident first happened. She was crying and pleading for the person who did this to come forward. 

She was the granddaughter that stayed with my victim the night he was killed... the night I killed him. 

I stared into a her harsh blue eyes before reaching for the phone with shaky fingers. 

Words eluded me at first as I pressed the phone to my ear. 

"Hello-..."

"Don't." She cut me off. 

"I don't want you to talk. I want you to listen."

I snapped my mouth shut and slowly nodded, still locked in her bitter gaze.

"I want you to know who you killed. My grandfather, his name was Emory. He loved fishing and camping. He lit up when his dog, Rex, wanted to play fetch. He had two children, five grandchildren, and two great grandchildren. Twins boys he never got to meet because of YOU!"

She spat the last word out like it was poison. Tears streamed down my face.

"Do you know what the doctors said?" She continued. "They could've saved him had you just called for help and not left him. Left him to DIE like a rodent!"

I was starting to tremble as I sobbed. 

She leaned in as close as she could to the glass without touching it. Her gaze somehow became even more laced with hate. 

"He's coming for you, little girl. I asked for vengeance and he is coming." She whispered the words. 

She slammed the phone on the receiver, stood up and stormed away. 

I cried as the guards led me back to my cell. Her last words echoing in my brain. 

Later that night, I was curled up on the top bunk. Shaking from either crying or the cold, maybe both. At some point, I must have drifted off to sleep.

I woke up with jolt. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the darken cell. When my eyes did focus I froze . 

My cellmate was standing up facing me. Eyes wide open and unblinking. Face flat with a blank expression. 

I watched as her head tilted to the right, slowly touching her shoulder. Then came the sickening sound of bone and muscle snapping as she continued to move head passed her shoulder. 

Her head suddenly stopped once completely upside down. Chin pointed towards the ceiling and gray straggley hair hanging towards the floor. Eyes still wide open glaring up at me. 

I finally broke from my horrified trance and screamed. I covered my face with my hands. 

After a moment of silence, I pulled my hands from my face and slowly opened my eyes. 

Nothing. No cellmate standing with her head hanging from her broken neck.

I slowly leaned down and looked to the lower bunk. My cellmate was fast asleep, I could hear her steady breathing.

I flopped back down on my bunk. "Just a dream, it's not real" I whispered to myself. The night guards hadn't come. Surely they would've heard me scream.

Yes, it was just my messed up head again. I turned to face the cement wall.

"He's coming for you" whispered in the back of my mind as I drifted off to sleep again. 

The next couple of days passed as normal as they could in this place, especially as a loaner. I even avoided my cellmate more than usual. 

Then I was in my cell alone a few evenings ago. I stared down in to the water that had formed in the sink. Stupid thing hardly drained. I looked at what could see of my reflection. Wondering if I looked as lifeless as I felt when I noticed something.

There was a shape behind me. Like a figure looking over my shoulder. I leaned down slightly to get a better look when I heard it.

"I see you." Whispered in a rough male voice right into my ear. 

I jumped and turned around. Eyes darting around the empty cell. Chills covered my body.

"It's not real" I closed my eyes and repeated over and over to myself.

The granddaughter's warning still bouncing around my brain.

Then tonight happened.

I had once again fallen asleep crying. Thoughts of Jake haunting my dreams when I woke up. 

There was heavy pressure on top of me pushing and holding me down on my bunk. 

As my eyes opened and focused, a scream caught in my throat.

One of the night guards I was familiar with was on top of me. Eyes glaring down at me, expression blank at first.

I then watched in terror as his eyes widened, bulging out of his head. Face morphing into that of an old man I  recognized all too well. 

Blood poured from his inhuman and large eyes, nose and mouth. His horrible face twisted into a look of absolute rage. 

"I! SEE! YOU!" He screamed so loud that my ears began to ring.

I felt the blood splattering over my face as he yelled again "I SEE YOU! I SEE YOU!"

I began to scream and fight, trying hard to move, kick, punch, anything!

"YOU'RE NOT REAL! YOU'RE NOT REAL! YOU'RE NOT REAL!" I cried out as I fought to get the thing off me!
Next thing I knew, I was being dragging off my bunk and hand cuffed. I continued to scream as I was drug out of my cell and down the hall.

I came to later to see a different environment around me. 

I was in a hospital bed. I could hear the voice of a woman. 

"She has gone completely insane! They found her screaming and beating herself up! Shes covered in self inflicted bruised and scratches! She even pulled clumps of her own hair out!" 

I couldn't move much but I could see the woman off to the side talking to a guard. I noticed she was wearing scrubs. 
I looked down at myself to see cuts and bruises covering my arms. I tried to lift my arms and felt pain immediately.

I realized she was talking about me. I must be in the infirmary. I had hurt myself. 

The two walked off without noticing I was awake. I noticed a cellphone on a near by table. Can she even have that in here? I don't know nor do I care. 

I fought through the stiffness and pain to grab it. To type this out. To tell the grand finale to my sad story. 

I finally understand why he keeps saying "I see you". He doesn't want to see me anymore. Not alive at least. 

I won't make it to trial. I'll die in this prison. Maybe in this very bed tonight. 
Turning myself in wasn't enough. Accountability wasn't enough. 

I can only hope to find peace in death. Maybe in another time in another life. I can only hope it includes Jake somehow. 

The nurse is here now. She's glaring at me. Those awful wide eyes but now a wicked grin with them.

Congratulations, dear granddaughter. Your vengeance is served.
