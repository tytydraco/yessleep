The Christmas party was in full swing, Julia just left the kitchen carrying a plate with a little bit of everything that looked appealing from the buffet and walked past the largest conference room where the music was blaring the usual suspects of seasonal tunes because all you could ever want for Christmas was a little Wham and the rock of Jingle bells. Food for thought, she mused smirking.

She passed a few colleagues who were chatting the Marketing area while munching away, this was the goofy group and indeed Thomas made a show of eating one of the appetizers like an overly flamboyant Maître de Cuisine seeking to destroy his competitor with opinionated feedback.

Passing the small meeting room, she saw the vicious foursome everyone steered clear of, because they had that toxic cheerleader energy and they were speaking in low voices, which undoubtedly meant that they were bitching about some poor soul.

She peeked into the room where some of the software engineers worked, hoping to see Mats, but she saw Jorge and Andrew talking and staring at one of the screens, Andrew beer in hand, Jorge pointing at something on the screen, explaining something in his gentle Mexican accent, their plates were still half full.

She looked around the large open-space area where most other people sat and worked. Small groups had spread in different corners and she looked out for Mats, who was sitting with Benji, one of the SysOps guys, chatting, eating and drinking. She sat down with them.

A young man, Julia estimated him to be in his late teens early twenties, walked into the open-plan and from his gait, she could see that he was a little tipsy already. She had never seen him before and the question must have shown on her face. Benji, who’d been with the company for five years whispered:

“That’s Raphael, Theo’s son.”

Theo was the facility manager, he always looked a little gruff, but he was a man with a heart of gold.

Raphael sat down two desks away from Mats, Benji and herself muttering something about ‘delicious’. She could not tell whether he was trying to get into their conversation by making himself heard or just mumbling.

Julia observed him out of the corner of her eyes for a few minutes as he made a show of tucking into his heaped plate. Something in her wanted to ask him over so he could join their conversation, because he seemed lonely in an I-am-pretending-to-enjoy-myself kind of way and she knew that feeling only too well. Yet, she could not bring herself to do it. There was something about the young man, … like he was surrounded by a brown-black haze, which -she chided herself- was most certainly not there. And yet it was. It made her feel uncomfortable and she did not want him to sit close to her.

It was shortly after one in the morning when she left the Christmas party with Mats, the cold air hit them hard but it also felt good after the food and the alcohol-fuelled karaoke. Julia breathed in deeply once they left the building. They waited for the taxi, which took a little longer to arrive in the car, Julia put her head on Mats shoulder, he took her hand and brushed a light kiss on her temple.

“You ok?” ”Tired, possibly a little drunk,” she admitted. ”Same,” he smiled.

On Monday she was back at work and during lunch in the kitchen, people were doing a post-mortem of the Christmas party. Well, it was more like an exchange of gossip really and it always worked exquisitely, compared to project related post-mortems where truths were swept under the carpet. This way, Julia learnt that Thomas had finally managed to hook up with Lisa after pining over her since May. Good for them, she thought. They were sweet together.

Evelyn, the front desk assistant, always knew everything. She was the info node and volunteered that at five in the morning on Saturday, Theo and Raphael had had a nasty row. Raphael had drunk way too much, knocked over a table, thrown up twice, once on the terrace, once into a bin. Theo wanted Raphael to go home with him, whereas Raphael insisted to sleep on the sofa in meeting room 3. When Theo tried to pull Raphael with him to the car, confronting him about his drinking habits, Raphael had pushed his father back and had stormed out of the building. The people who had listened to that account went very quiet, Andrew shook his head. “Boys, eh?!” Some nodded quietly in agreement. Julia finished her lunch, on the way back to her desk, she nearly bumped into Theo, who was rushing through the hallway, looking even more gruff than usual. When she apologised but he waved it off, distractedly and went on his way.

In the late afternoon, it was already dark, Julia went to the toilet and then to the kitchen where Evelyn, Benji and Andrew sat quietly. It was not like them at all to be quiet, all three of them were chatty, but when she entered the silence was so heavy and solid that she stopped dead in the doorframe.

“Everything alright,” she asked although she could clearly tell that everything was wrong.

Benji fidgeted. Evelyn rubbed her hands as though she was cold. Andrew swallowed visibly.

Now Julia wasn’t quite sure whether she wanted to have an answer to her question at all, but Evelyn spoke after clearly struggling on how to phrase things.

“After Theo’s and Raphael’s row, Raphael stormed off without jacket.” Julia nodded. She knew that and suddenly she knew that whatever came next would be unsettling.

Evelyn continued. “He didn’t come home on Saturday. Didn’t come home on Sunday. Theo was worried, called around.”

Andrew got up, grabbed his cup of tea and squeezed past Julia to leave the kitchen.

Evelyn breathed. “Police was here half an hour go to talk to Theo. They found Raphael at the side of the four lane country road just off the industrial estate. He got run over by a truck presumably.”

Julia felt bile rising like lava in her stomach.

“He’s… dead,” she asked carefully, moving to lean against the wall, face pale now.

Evelyn nodded, picked up her half-full glass and refilled it at the water cooler before leaving the kitchen as well.

Benji looked at Julia, concern showing on his face.

“You ok?”

Julia did not reply, it was a rhetorical question for her. She saw the fairy lights in the windows of the building opposite theirs, glowing warm.

Her hands were ice-cold and suddenly she shivered. It’s not like she had known Raphael at all, but she knew Theo a little. He and his son had parted in anger, a few days before Christmas without a chance of reconciliation.

Then she remembered that dark haze around Raphael when he was eating a few desks away from her little group and that made her wonder whether she had seen death hovering.
