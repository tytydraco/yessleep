What is the secret word for all the goodness in the world?

If you know where to look, you can find it in a churchyard near the Potomac River on a humid July night. 

Bottled into three sounds inside a glass jar wrapped by a label with eight letters, like a twirling waltz in 3:8 time, is one name.

Each letter holds a clue to the warm glow of summer lightning bugs housed inside.

But to experience the warmth of gentle summer nights, you need first to know the chill of spring and autumn. Because as Tolkien, who loved riddles, said, “What lies beyond stars and under hills, comes first and follows after” is darkness.

I write these words in the darkness of a cold hospital room, with two books left here by others who didn’t know me, my company on Christmas Eve: The Hobbit and The Bible. Their stories meander with mine.

This secret word, my buried treasure, knew darkness too, but not in the dramatic way of martyrs like Job or Jesus. Hers was in the understated Bilbo Baggins way of appreciating little things. My vanquisher of sadness, my breaker of night, was not a grey wizard bearing the staff of Moses. She was an unassuming little dirty-blond girl, reluctant and unexpected, as true heroes always are, who became the glowing ember through my journey there and back again, to Mirkwood, over the Misty Mountains, down into the fiery cauldron of Mordor, and on to the Shire. 

Nobody loved a cozy Hobbit hole more than this creature of green pastures, she and her elf dog, Sparkly Wigglebutt.

But like a gentle Shire brook trickling over rocks that form ripples rising out of the water, this bubbly river otter knew her share of sadness. There is salt even in the most crystal clear Caribbean waters and steam rising from the deepest Pacific trenches where it is said life began, so there was already a drop of black yin in the sea of white yang that came into my life one New York winter night on the Upper West Side, in the form of goodness that had sadness in her, too.

She was the first person I knew to have taken antidepressants, and I called her the crazy one for it. No words were ever more misplaced. When a dark cloud of yin consumed all the yang that had accumulated in my luck-stricken life for 42 years, that little drop of sadness became the source of unending understanding. She accepted me when I lost my ring of sleep in Gollum’s cave, and storm clouds rained down a relentless hail of depression as I searched desperately in vain for rest like Sméagol frantically looking for his lost precious.

So, what is this secret word? 

This Ark of the Covenant housing summer’s embers rests, not on four golden legs like the one Moses built, but on two living ones, a real-life da Vinci code that needs an Indiana Jones to crack, letter by letter. She met him once and always kept him in her passwords. So here’s my best effort to raid the Lost Ark, HarrisonJacksonFord style.

What starts with caring, curious, cute, cuddly, compassionate, mainly composed, but sometimes not?

When a person lives in your memory and you in theirs, is there one face in time that stays? Was it as kids on the school bus to Indian Lane? Was it in my 20s when a chance encounter led to a ruined Barbour jacket? Was it in my 30s when a hand tapped my shoulder at my little brother’s Lincoln Center wedding as Wynton Marsalis played the first dance on trumpet? Was it in my 40s as she slept in a chair beside my bed in the hospital? Was it eating fish fingers in bed in Anguilla or nibbling ramen in bed on Kalorama? Was it lying sideways on the sofa at P Street, M Street, or Pecks Point? Or was it a revolving door, a little warm nook, the repeating sound of a suitcase dropping on the floor at midnight, soft paws running out, a sleepy voice in the background mumbling, “Hey,” before rolling over again, my side of the bed already turned down to crawl right in.

The answer to these questions is the second letter —

All of them.

April. April first. April fools. One little joker appeared in a mixed litter of mutts on an island in the Chespeake that was the first place in Maryland to be settled, born of a stray dog, Naomi, who a mailman kept finding on his route in the remote hills of West Virginia, begging each day for food, a trait she’d soon pass on to the most talented beggar of all time, whose adorable eyes coaxed the mailman into finally bringing her home, and later giving her over to foster care, our little clown already growing fast inside mama Naomi as the surprises of a lifetime, one advertised as a Shepherd mix who was anything but, and had it in his blood to win over the hearts of every mailman, delivery person, and grounds worker he ever met all of whom ended up working for him, a perennial prankster who got the last laugh, tricking us into falling in love with him on first site as a two week old in a photo captioned “Peter Rabbit,” but who despite his bunny legs and Beatrixe Potter personality, was always for her, from the moment she first saw him, a different name, never once imagining he’d be part of our family, having told me long before her finger swiped over the adoption listing on City Dogs Rescue, that the only way I could bring home a pup was to put a ring on it.

No words were ever taken more literally. I’ve always been fast at problem solving, like Saint Mark writing the shortest account of Jesus’ life, so it only took me six weeks to go through the secret adoption process, and show up, one Friday evening as the sun was setting on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial, with a tiny puppy in my arms, who, before she spotted him, caught the eye of a group of visiting school kids, swarming me first in the dozens, then hundreds, to pet the little fur ball as I proceeded towards her, like a Pied Piper arriving with his flock, my flute, a little beige mut wearing a royal blue neck band bearing a small pendant with the freshly printed words “Hello, my name is Peanut Butter,” whose eyes she saw first, two giant marbles that would become the source of all that connected us, our love of life's simple things, so that it didn’t matter that she only saw second the platinum diamond ring attached to that same collar, because the most unbreakable ring was the living one in my hands, my eternal companion who took me to every forest path and river trail within two hours of all the places we’ve ever lived, not to mention every neighbor’s house including Mr. McGregor to collect and bring my mischievous litte runaway home, and her nighttime companion during all my long trips abroad, and more recently through my never-ending hospital stays, a cozy surrogate to keep a cold bed warm.

Speaking of river trails, a river runs through the third letter in the Garden of Eden, flanked on either side by the Tree of Life. It is said that this river brings the End of Night and an End to Curses, which I need, the gateway to an eternal spring whose magic grows from a hidden trickle to an Enchanted River, from a quiet melody to the roaring Moldau symphony of Middle Earth. This is the playful realm of river otters and river chipmunks.

At my childhood home on Georgetown Pike, a creek ran through life. I built dams in it every year, which, as I grew, got stronger and lasted longer before eventually washing away in Spring floods, repetitive work that allowed me to develop as an artist and an engineer hand-in-hand in a way few pursuits offer a young mind, perhaps alongside writing music, which I also did. At that place called Cloisters, filled by little fingers on a Steinway and pencil ledgers on a bedroom door marking heights from each birthday, in the height of summer, my younger brother Ben and I would head to the churchyard in back of our house at dusk carrying two glass jars to fill with as many fireflies as we could find. Lightning bugs are hard to catch because, like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, you can't simultaneously know their location and direction. By the time you run to the site of a flash, they've already flown somewhere else in the night sky.

Ben loved bugs like no one else. I searched the markets of New Delhi one year for Glow Worm toys to surprise him on Christmas. In our churchyard in Mclean, the one where Christmas Day football games happened with me as the quarterback, where I learned to pitch curveballs by throwing at a strike zone I painted by hand onto a white shed with black ink from a mulberry tree, the same tree on whose low-hanging branches Lindsey Wheeler and I would later spend so many nights as high school sweethearts, there Ben and I would bottle flashing fireflies, bringing them back to our rooms as lanterns, like flickering candles whose embers disappeared as we dreamed. Futile as our efforts were to keep the glow burning overnight, Ben eventually connected me to one whose light never ran out, no matter how many nights passed.

This is the letter of The Remembrance of Things Past because her voice is my Madeleine, conjuring memories from a churchyard that foretold millions of sweet moments that followed.

But this is also the letter of regret, the kind of hair-pulling loss and bewilderment that leads to frantically moving giant rocks at midnight, blasting Nirvana on a car stereo, singing Idioteque at full volume, shouting in the early morning darkness, begging to be freed from the curse, running from myself and the world, Searching for Lost Time to escape everything that became broken from one night in a club, dreaming of feeling whole again, chasing any hint of who I was before an eternal winter fog enveloped me with no light on the horizon and no sign of lifting. This is the letter of 43, a number I can't stomach to see and a year I want to erase. 

The fourth letter is what was always right in front of me because, of course, good things come in small packages. But it’s also the letter of sadness, knowing, of course, that I discovered that truth too late. Of course means 20/20 hindsight with no foresight in a world of tears running, drying, and still to come — so many that I am now a river, the only river I never loved. “Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you if you can find my beloved; I am faint of heart.” But I don’t go to church, so I never read those words until tonight in this hospital room.

Of course was my intuition, my saving grace. It's what Arturo said allowed me to build networks of so many constituents with opposing interests, coaxing them to get the job I wanted done, despite and because of their differences. Arturo was my greatest teacher, and Hilda helped me discover how to bring dreams, teams, and companies to life. I owe so much of who I became to them — not the paralyzed incapable me of today, but the ever-growing capable me of yesterday who always tried to give back more than I received. They showed me how to be strong but not greedy or shrewd like the ego-driven, close-fisted leaders no one likes. Instead, by learning from them, I tried to always be guided by love and curiosity, giving others the benefit of the doubt and letting honest intuition guide me in the drawing room, the board room, the salesroom, and at the negotiating table.

My firefly does that, too, in her own way with everyone. That’s part of what connected us and why she is adored by all who know her. Because we all want to live in a world that sees the glass as half full. She still sees me that way even after everything. My intuition about her was right. Never has it been more rewarded, even if undeservingly so.

Intuition is what caught my eyes in my first year at Potomac when I saw her so many grades below me, and again the night before my first work trip abroad in my early 20s, just as it did in my 30s one Saturday afternoon in a stone Oxfordshire Orangerie bathed in ancient music and soft October light. Never has generosity been more pure than hers in a way words can't capture because life is lived, not written. 

I lived 42 charmed years, either lucky or unlucky. Lucky to experience so much, so many adventures, such good around me; unlucky to learn so little about what it means to suffer, about that hidden half of the human condition that every prophet’s teaching is an attempt to make sense of, from the moment the apple was first picked in Eden to the last cry on the Cross. But you can't know suffering from parables, you only know it when the darkness comes to rip your life apart, like a curse sent by God to Egypt. That black plague is how my hands and feet are nailed to a cross by hospital needles on Christmas night, crying out in my head for a redeemer to take me away.

A redeemer did come, not to bring me salvation but to show me grace. She appeared in the form of a crack-head named Kyvonna with a lazy eye, a sworn Crypt and suppoed cousin of Snoop Dogg, who returned to the hospital on Christmas Eve, three hours after being discharged, the same day I met her, to bring me my one and only present. She came back for me, my secret Santa, bearing pretzels and Gatorade, like frankincense and myrrh. That is the kind of grace you can’t know until you're strung up on a post, thorns prodding your veins, your mouth parched dry from propofol, surrounded on either side by nameless castoffs bearing their own crosses… a mute with two teeth who could checkmate me in a dozen moves, a head-on car-crash survivor who graduated from a top private school at 15 but now can’t string together a sentence, a card shark with 12 inches of stitching holding his head together after trying to end it all following a botched surgery that took away his vision without warning, a catatonic Mexican boy who mumbles incoherent phrases, a Native American woman who sits in silence with her ancestors, and my roommate, a dreadlocked homeless man with COPD who coughs all night — all of us watched by two guards of Pontus Pilot, a Dutch-speaking nurse from Guyana, and a Francophone RN from Cameroon. Even the Christmas Truce of 1914 brought a more likely crew together for yuletide than our lot tonight.

Kyvonna coming back is why intuition only takes you so far, because life’s strangest truths come from the places and times you could never imagine in your wildest dreams or scariest nightmares, as has been the case through this torturous, earth-shattering, eye-opening, all-encompassing year, one that as it draws to a close, still has me breathing, sort of.

The fifth letter is the letter of limitless. Of keeping the heavy light, as she always did, and making the light whole, the full following, the flowing grounded. 

It’s the letter of everything in its right place, which she managed even when my world was spinning on its head. You create this equilibrium by bringing two poles together like opposing magnets. That is how her force balanced mine, and hopefully, mine hers in my best moments.

If only doctors understood. When you’re a hammer, everything’s a nail, and when you’re a psychiatrist, every problem’s a pill. Just as mice share 85% of our DNA, in the medieval world of psych drugs, we’re all mice being ed chemicals no one understands.  The Columbine shooters were on SSRIs. Most people who attempt suicide do so on pills as prescribed, as was my case all three times.

Correlation doesn’t equal causation, but Clay Christiansen, who mentored my best friend, Wrede, famously said that people don’t buy hammers to put nails in walls; they buy them to get a job done. Psychiatrists don’t understand it means to get a job done. Instead, they hammer nails blindly into trees, never seeing the forest.

In the northern forests of Canada, at college, there was a pale-skinned, dark-eyed student who roamed the fringes of so many experiences there. He was older than the rest of us because he never graduated despite getting perfect marks. Instead, he just added new majors each year. So by the time I met Paul Michaud of Quebec City, he spoke eight languages fluently, all learned in classes he kept retaking until he had them memorized, like the birthdate of everyone he ever met, including me. You could find Paul waiting outside on the pub on any given night as last call sounded, silently accompanying some group back to dorms over the Massawippi Arches, aurora borealis dancing in the northern sky, only to be seen a few hours later at dawn, walking the first school group to morning classes, the same solemn, drained, expressionless, look in his eyes. 

What made Paul the omnipresent lurker of campus nights, mornings, and all times in between? 

Insomnia. 

“Dark shadows ring my eyes, yet my prayer is pure.” 

Paul’s eyes were ringed from never sleeping, but his heart was pure. I knew this because I spoke with him in a way few others did and came to understand the silent torture he suffered in a prison that never released him during the four years I was there. He was sleepless on the day I graduated, just like the day I arrived, and is probably still wandering campus in that state, if he’s not dead yet, as insomnia has a tendency to do. If he is alive, he will still remember and be able to tell you my birthday in any language.

During the time I knew Paul, I never imagined his quiet desperation foretold my future, that the same black circles I first saw wrapping his eyes would so many years later frame those of the only other true insomniac I ever met: me in my 43rd year.

But this is not the letter of watching life go by, as Paul did, and as I did this year, missing out on heartbreaking chances, the kind you wait a lifetime for, hoping, like a Field of Dreams, that if you build it, they will come. I watched Babe Ruth step up to the plate under autumn stars last year. But as our game got underway, I was sidelined for the first time in my life, sick, unable to throw my signature curveball from the mound. I delayed play as long as I could but eventually had to forfeit the greatest matchup of all time.

Instead of watching from the sidelines as Paul did, and I have done this year, the fifth letter is the letter of living, childhood living, easy living, lucky love, young love, the kind I had at my fingertips for 42 years before drug-induced insomnia reduced everything to a picture of a picture in a blurry, pixilated, lackluster game of telephone.

What makes a drop become an ocean, expand a ray of light into a sunny sky, and grow a blade of grass into a field of barley? Life. Plain and simple.

That’s what soul mates show you, not just when it feels good but also when it hurts. She taught me that even if I'm no longer able to hold up to my end of the bargain as anguish and regret beat me down in a way I can’t shake, no matter how hard I try. This year brought gravity on a superhuman level that smothered me as I watched everything I wanted burn away, little by little, before my eyes. That is the kind of torture sociopaths orchestrate, plucking the arms of ants one by one without killing them, so they see their world fall apart as they languish in pain.

Was it a random sequence of drugs that combined to turn me into a legless ant? Or was it a curse written in the stars, like Abraham tasked to kill his beloved son? Was it the cruelty of nature or a divine punishment that, just when I finally had all I wanted in life, I lost it all?

Either way, the song remains the same.

The sixth letter is for I. 

I belong. 

“I belong to my beloved, and my beloved to me.” 

This is also the letter of the worst I. The narcissistic I who got caught staring at his reflection, who put himself first more than I want to remember. The I that Paul warned of in Philippians, “Do nothing out of selfish ambition.” The I of moments I hid, when I did what I wanted. The I of long trips alone, plane rides through the night to Alaska, Patagonia, Belize, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Ukraine, and the scenes of so many other adventurous cheating nights spent with faces and names I can’t even remember. 

But I is not just the letter of confession. 

It is also the letter of redemption, of cozy Interstate drives with a little hot water bottle on my lap as a copilot. Of so many trips together, of Italian wine in the Tuscan sun over a river, of lying in Capri over a bay, imagining a dreamy future that was always waiting, but in the end, through this year’s u-turn, never came. 

This is the letter of all I did and didn’t do. The times she said, "I’m proud of you," and I didn’t say it back, but I feel it now. I’m proud of you — way more than of myself.

I always knew I didn’t know best. No one does. Maybe it was being a middle child or a musical kid. Whatever the reason, I have an innate affinity for the polyphony of navigating tough questions in teams.

But then, in July and again this December, when I was suffering beyond belief, grappling with the hardest question of my life, I had to decide all by myself. The paradox of suicidality is that you can’t talk through your suffering and the logic behind your escape plan because every social norm and legal protocol is designed to shut the thought down on arrival or take away your freedom for voicing it.

This catch-22 left a guy who never liked making decision on his own, who always feared the blind spots he could not see, to make the most irreversible choice of my life three times without input despite being surrounded by the most caring people in the world. That is the Achilles heel of my downward spiral since July, one that I hope society someday finds an answer to.

This is the letter of forgiveness and humility.

It's being in the ICU when the dumbest sitter of all was the wisest. There I was in restraints, a tube stretching my lungs, beating me down in a way no one should ever experience. For all my advanced degrees, it was a sitter with none who taught me the most. Who is Falstaff now? Who is the one being laughed at? Being mean is no way to be. I’m sorry. I can’t say I learned my lesson; more like the lesson learned me.

My lightning bug refused to see the ugly in me, only the good. She saw it in how I treated colleagues, partners, animals, trees, and the thousands of people I helped along the way, with kindness. That is her approach to the world, too.

But I am the good, the bad, and the ugly. 

Ugliness fills this hospital room tonight, mirroring me, track lines running down my arms, hands, and legs like a secret map of subcutaneous highways, a photo on the wall of a misty river I can’t bear to look at for the nostalgia rivers bring, an orange crayon in my hand as I scribble this note, feeling things no words could ever capture, no man should ever feel. 

You enter life with a light heart and an open mind. You leave it with a heavy heart and a mind filled with memories of past lives and what-ifs from another earth. In between, if you're lucky or unlucky, you learn to forgive and be forgiven. Asking for forgiveness is the hardest thing because no one wants to believe they hurt another. We’re always kind in our eyes. Only now can I see all I did that needs forgiving. And by writing this, I know she will. That is her forgiving heart. Where little things say big things. I could say more by writing less.

The seventh letter is next. It's why you can’t keep lightning bugs bottled up. Because the beauty and tragedy of life is that the good is here one day and gone the next. That is what every parable since the dawn of time has also tried to make sense of, from God punishing Job for no reason to spoiled Salome ordering John The Baptist’s head on a plate for her amusement.

This letter is about moving forward, knowing that life's warm glow won't last forever, as it did so many years of my life, and trying to tell myself that the arctic wasteland surrounding me now is a season that may someday pass, even if I don’t believe it. This is the letter of not giving in, not letting go, not losing hope. 

When the plague of the firstborn became the plague of the middle-born, and unending sleeplessness brought death’s doorstep, as I became the crazy one and her little Wellbutrin was a baby Asprin compared to the Halloween stash I had to take each night, when I finally I gave up, she didn't. 

I wish I still had her belief in me.

She was by my side on the stroke floor after my hanging, as arrogant doctors said I was in shock when I was experiencing something far more dangerous: anoxic delirium. 

She was by my side at the trauma unit after I jumped in that delirious state headfirst down a six-flight stairwell, as arrogant doctors said my cognitive impairments — losing my mind’s eye and splintering my vision — were delusions.

She was by my side when I woke up last week in the Revive & Resuscitate ICU from a three-day coma, intubated, a breathing machine shoved down my throat, having swallowed a bottle of pills that arrogant doctors told me would make me feel better, but did the opposite.

This heavy-handed approach masks the insecurity of doctors who know they don’t understand the human mind. So they become secret Soviet police fitting evidence to a pre-fab theory without knowing what actually happened: “Show me the man, and I’ll show you the crime.” That is the science of psychiatrists.

But each of these scenes also tells of her limitless grace. How she nursed me back to life so long as she had breath, despite all I did to take mine away. The reason I am alive tonight is because, after swallowing a bottle of pills in the woods, I returned to look at her and the little guy lying on the bed one more time, my heart pulling me back to my favorite scene. That’s how she found me when I went unconscious.

If you want to know the human mind, just ask 15 people to look out a window and tell you what they see. What you’ll hear is what in music we call, Theme and Variations. Because there is more neurodivergence than convergence between us. 

This is why prescribing psych meds is like asking a window washer on an airplane tarmac to course-correct a flight falling from 40,000 feet. Window washers work on planes, but they don’t repair engines. When it comes to the mind’s engine, no one on earth is qualified to tinker. The motto of doctors is “Do no harm.” They would do less by not hiding behind jargon and pills. Better to be humble about what you do not know. 

When I look out the window, I see 10,000 words that trace my life growing up, from the first sounds my mom taught me to vocab I internalized at school to words like "intubated,” learned after a giant hose was wrenched from my lungs this week. This arsenal is how, through a single view, an infinitely deep well of language fills my pallet.

When I look out the window, I see a mind that can pick out 20 people I’ve met from a sea of 1000 faces at any one of the thousands of concerts I’ve been part of in my career. 

When I look out the window, I see my endless love of learning, the deposits I steadfastly made to grow, protect, and nourish my mind as a resource that I loved. That is why the changes of this year are so hard to accept because I was the last person I ever imagined would have my brain wrenched away. It was one the thing I could always count on. Now I've become the driving instructor crippled in a car crash. 

When I look out the window, I remember the mind that gave me every opportunity for 42 years and the one that closed every door in my 43rd, as it went from regular to irregular, from my most renewable resource to my most costly liability, from my saving grace to my mortal danger, from my rock to my kryptonite, overnight. A mind can be the most beautiful and liberating force in the universe or the most ugly and oppressive one. Bright in the sun, dark in its shadow.

When I look out the window, I remember the clear lens that allowed me to learn all I did about the world. And I see the bent lens that now obscures the world from me. “Know thyself,” said the Oracle at Delphi. I can't anymore, say I. As my brain changed, my soul vanished, and the fuel of my dreams disappeared — leaving me to burn fumes and run on empty as my engine inching towards shutdown. That is how one night robbed the present and future, leaving Christmas Eve for scribbling notes about the past.

Take it from someone who learned the hard way, never hand the mind’s universe to doctors who speak a coded language no one understands. Jargon is the canary of ineptitude. Because more dangerous than a lost mind is one imprisoned by insecure guards who each add chemical fingerprints to a hubristic concoction like artists applying brushstrokes to a canvas passed from one hand to the next before the paint has dried — palimpsests that never get clearer with time, only muddier. No brushwork ever helped me because my blank slate was the only canvas I needed. My factory setting was the right one.

But then my operating system went haywire from a virus brought by one pill that changed my code. And as doctors applied thick oil paint that bled into me, everything was obscured from view. Eventually, through the caked-on layers of a clouded mind, just one light remained. 

It was this Lonestar I saw when fireworks rained down outside my lonely window at the Retreat on the Fourth of July. It was this Lonestar I looked up to as I sat on a log, pleading with God to release me from the curse before cursing him. And it was this Lonestar I heard over the phone tonight as carols echoed through hallways outside a beeping hospital room.

That undying ember is why I am here. I haven’t yet known total darkness because she never let me, much as I tried to make it all go black.

And so, the last letter is everything.

Everything said and unsaid. Said but undone. Dreamed and believed. All we saw in each other — every moment of laughter and tears. The ones shed, and the ones still to come, which will someday run dry before eternity sets in. 

This letter is for the memories that return after all the screams, sirens, beeps, calls, condolences, and inquests fade from view. It’s the familiar purr of good things returning in little memories. Of seeds planted that will grow forever. The hundreds, even thousands, of trees I put in the earth to outlive me, the endless privet hedges I laid beside the ocean, ancient white oaks I uncovered and nurtured in Royal Oak, red oaks framing the most soothing entrance on earth at Knights Bend, curving along the river of life, like the Return to Eden in Ecclesiastes, reborn in rural Quebec.

This is the letter for every branch I painstakingly limbed by hand to create light for plants below or to open a view like Capability Brown, or the acres of grasses I cleared and manicured, the geometric apple orchard I sowed, wrapped by bluestone borders, that now bear fruit, of handmade river rapids brought to life across so many summers to glisten and sing in the afternoon sun and reflect the Harvest moon rising in the northeast at the head of a private sleepy hollow. 

This is the letter of coy-wolf pups playing on a snowy Canadian driveway as we return from a fireside dinner at Hovey Manor or The Ripplecove, of drystone walls laid, piece by piece, to a secret rhythm, granite blocks moved trip by trip from a quarry, combining in a giant earthen puzzle like stone fugues celebrating in nature the divine counterpoint Bach saw in God, fieldstone fences patinated through the oxidation of time, which Proust taught me would happen as years passed, becoming a worn grey tapestry of secret passageways for garter snakes, boulders covered by the gentle swirl of Virginia creeper, cloaked in the rustling sound of wind whispering down the gentle Tomifobia, boathouse doors swinging opening on Lac Memphrémagog to let the light in and a laughter-filled afternoon of waterskiing out.

This is the letter of December gusts sweeping across a white-capped Choptank, salt spray from a 20-mile fetch, the biggest sunset anywhere on the East Coast, delivering relentless waves crashing over rip-rap, a wine dark Chesapeake swallowing the red setting winter sun disappearing on the solstice into its most southerly corner at the mouth of an open ocean.

This is the letter of golden rays vanishing into the horizon at a place I now call Last Light, the splash of little paws wading into brackish water from a pebble beach to fetch a stick, a cold swim he’d rather not take, but does to show me, in his own way, in his own language, what love means. In all the Jack London books I read as a kid dreaming of mighty wolves and strong huskies, I never imagined a little hound would hold the most unbreakable key to my heart. But that is the nature of heroes: they come unexpectedly in unlikely form. Never was man’s best friend loved more.

This is the letter for each of these scenes and an infinite kaleidoscope of others across two countries, two rivers, three homes, three lives, four seasons, four paws, and millions of forgotten moments in between coming back without warning in dreams. “There’s a sudden joy that’s like a fish, a moving light, I thought I saw it, rowing on the Lakes of Canada.” That’s how I see them. 

And I see her in so many of them. In the distant ones where I am standing tall and strong, making speeches, laughing, winning over crowds in a cocktail as I did so many times in my sleep. And in the near ones where I am crawling on broken knees without sleep, lost to the world, the desperation of Paul Michaud’s black-ringed eyes slowly, relentlessly, morphing into my own.

This is the letter for every time I should have said I love you, for each memory I took for granted while it was made, for all we imagined walking on the pink sands of Harbour Island, rum punches in hand, gazing out on the endless white Bahamian bonefish flats, dreaming the dreams we dreamed before Mexican dice rolled a different fate one Friday night at a club, breaking me to the point that on Christmas Eve, one year later, I can’t remember what any of those dreams felt like. The hardest part is not losing the memories, it’s losing their feelings.

This is the letter of those feelings returning someday, somehow, in an eternal summer, where the little guy is in the nook, somewhere between her legs and mine, on a night before January when I could still drift easily and soundly to sleep, passing out in the first minute of Rainday Antiques, as she watches Cobra Kai beside me, three peas in the pod, grey and green tree frogs singing outside, perennial summer friends peering in with giant eyes through glass windows as fireflies dart back and forth in the sky beyond.

“When the darkness enveloped, wrapped, and cloaked me,” as it did Bilbo’s companions in their journey through the soot of Mordor into the flames of Smaug, her ember kept me seeing up from down, forwards from backward. When no oxygen was left in my atmosphere, she held the candle that never went out. It brought me back from death three times already and kept me from falling over the edge more than anyone will ever know. But it’s not like her to take credit. She did it silently, lovingly, with a light touch, a smile, and a laugh, because that's who she is at heart, and that's what this last letter is about — not just what everything means to me, but also what everything means to her: for better and for worse, in sickness and in health, till death do us part.

This is the letter of good times, bad times, and most of all, every time I held that warm bottle in my hand.

Can you spell the secret word to unlock its treasure?

If you’re Indiana Jones, you can. 

If you’re Bilbo Baggins, you can. 

If you’re Moses, you can.

And if you're me, you can. 

Because no matter how far gone my mind may be, I will always be able to write her name. It’s imprinted in me. 

Forever. 

But deciphering this burn-after-reading hieroglyph is like Indiana finding the lost ark, only to have the temple walls collapse around him. Uncovering the name of this eight-letter secret opens the firefly lid and sets all the lightning bugs free. Because you hold true goodness just long enough to feel it’s glow and know what the best moments of life mean before turning their living embers back to the oxygen of a summer night so that white sheets can be turned down, bedside lights can be turned out, the air conditioning can be turned up, and a sleepy elf-hound can curl up at the foot of the bed, resting his little head on an ankle, stars shining down in a world where all is still well. 

I've dreamed of being back in that old world every waking hour since January, just to feel once more the man I was before a chemical mind-virus turned me into a ghost I don't recognize. Maybe I will feel its glow again when I am made whole in the next, as scripture promises. Though it's also written, depending on how I leave, that I may be condemned to go on suffering for eternity.

In the small hours of the morning, I sometimes wonder if I already died on one of those July days when the odds were stacked against my survival. It feels like I'm wandering through a fiery brimstone, forced to see everything I love get ripped from my arms, one piece at a time, like the legs of an ant writhing in pain. It’s a morose thought that this could be hell, but each time I try to say goodbye, I keep being brought back in a worse state than before, stuck in a repeating zugzwang. Is this divine intervention, or is the devil laughing? Is this heavenly or a hellish Groundhog Day? The answer is in my lifeless eyes, languishing days, and lacerating nights.

Here’s the thing: didn’t Jesus ascend when the pain became unbearable? Wasn’t he the one to plead, "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" And when he cried out on the cross, didn’t the earth shake at Golgotha and lift his soul?

On the outskirts of Jerusalem one February afternoon two years ago — on a trip filled with the kindness of my friend, Nathan, and his family  — I wandered alone through the Mount of Olives, exploring its shady groves and ancient monasteries. At the end of my walk, I sat in silence in the Garden of Gethsemane at the foot of the hill, where it is said Jesus sat in agony, foreseeing his betrayal and crucifixion. I couldn't see he betrayal waiting around the corner in my own life and the endless suffering coming down the road. So, unlike Jesus, fate caught me by surprise.

But when it comes to the prospect of banishment, here’s what I believe: I was condemned in Cabo one year ago with a crippling curse I’ll never understand. As I tried to rid the affliction through every treatment on earth, each step only made the suffocating pain worse, ripping, arm by arm, all I loved from me, including who I am, until my world was empty.

I don't know God, but I know his Son because I walked in his footsteps on that mountain and have suffered in agony since January. No matter when or how it goes down, if there is a land of milk and honey out there, I know a seat is waiting for me at its table because I love this beautiful world as He does, despite the tragic hand it dealt us both. He understands that I can’t live in the unbearable pain of shadows forever.

In this world of shadow, one lone flame remains as my broken year draws to a close.

Her Olympic torch withstood the whipping winds as others burned out — forgetting, betraying, giving up, fading away, retreating from a life made invisible by my never-ending search for Sméagol’s lost ring of sleep, worn down by the attrition of the hardest 12 months I could ever imagine — in spite of which, or perhaps because of which, Bilbo's riddle shines truer than ever in my heart: that above her, below her, before her, after her, all returns to darkness.

Hers is the goodness of fireflies in summer, filled with the laughter of two brothers chasing flashes across the night sky. 

You can still find lightning bugs in that churchyard on Georgetown Pike, glowing embers in the darkness of July, dancing to the faint echos of little voices long gone but not forgotten, so long as we both shall live.
