I open the marketplace tab on the library laptop for the 12th time this week. 

"Morgan, honey you only have another hour with the computer as we have other library guests who need to use them!"
 "Okay, Fran. Thanks for being patient I'm really trying to find a place!" 

Fran the librarian has been really nice to me considering how much time I have been spending sitting around the computers, and half falling asleep on the library tables since I pretty much have no where else to go.
I have been couch surfing in a new city and I'm close to being out on the streets if I can't find some living arrangement for myself by the end of the week. 
As a 23 year old woman who tried and ultimately failed at cooperate america, I had a bit of a breakdown and made the split second decision to move as far away as possible from the city I grew up in.  I spent the majority of my meager savings moving, and aside from my beat up car, and a small storage unit inconveniently located 15 miles out of town, I have very little to my name. 

Finally, A post pops up on marketplace with a few pictures of an older, Victorian style house with a room for rent. There are very few pictures of the rooms in the house, and the first paragraph goes right into describing-
"ABOUT YOUR POTENTIAL ROOMIES:
-Annabelle is a white leaning, trans masc female, who loves to mix potions in the communal kitchen, and get my friends to try them! I am a strong headed socialist and pro abortion. 
-Lisa is a fun loving hippie free spirit who owns 5 cats (no more pets allowed) and practices just a few rituals for her spirituality every week. Would need a roomie willing to participate with us! NON negotiable. Nudity will be necessary at some points to participate (ifykyk)

We are looking for a roommate that both passes our vibe check, and merges with our spirits on a divine level. Chores are split evenly, we are very clean people but we do love to have a fun time on Thursday and Saturday nights! No music is allowed, except for our selection of records. We can provide sheet music that is appropriate if you are musically inclined, any music post 18th century will disturb the cats!! Due to the size of the house, no overnight guests would be allowed. Our sleep schedule will require you to be home by 10pm at the latest, and quiet times are from 10pm to 3am. 
Rent would be negotiable if you are willing to put in some work with the cooking, cleaning, help out with our potion making and spiritual rituals! Looking for someone who really vibes with our energies and would love to bring the right person in for the best year of your life! Please text xxx-xxx-xxxx to set up a time for us to meet!"

Considering I have been looking for so many hours, and everything has either been wildly out of my price range or seeming extremely dangerous, it was safe to say I was pretty desperate for something to work out. The rent being negotiable really caught my eye. As I already mentioned, I am extremely strapped for cash and I am pretty handy when it comes to fixing things around the house, and I don't mind cleaning. Since I don't know anyone in this new city, the 10pm curfew may be weird for a bunch of adult roommates, but it wouldn't be a problem as I'm usually asleep by 9:30 anyways. 
Yeah, so there were a lot of red flags and just generally confusing points made in the post, but hell I need a place and I'm willing to learn whatever I need to learn about these people in order to get them to let me stay.
I called the number the next day and it immediately shot to voice-mail. Damn. I forgot the post said to only text. 

"Hey, so sorry about that call. I was wanting to inquire about the room you have listed for rent on fb marketplace? I am very interested in meeting up with you both to learn more! I'm pretty much available all day so just let me know what times would work for you to meet!"
