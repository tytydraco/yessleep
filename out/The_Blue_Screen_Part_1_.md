Back in 2007, I was a broke 25-year-old student pursuing my PhD in astrophysics. I had an apartment with a little furnishings as I had pennies to my name. 

Even 18 years ago, school was expensive, and my job at the local science center didn’t pay me well enough to afford all of the comforts of home I would have preferred. I eventually resorted to stealing cable from a neighbor in a nearby apartment. An elderly widow named Sylvia. She was a very sweet lady who mostly kept to herself, except whenever she needed help bringing her groceries inside or would occasionally ask me for assistance with her computer or tv. I never minded helping her, and she would occasionally return my favors by either giving me a few snacks to take out with me, or would slip a $20 bill into my hand for playing tech support for five minutes. 

I thought at the time that she may have just been lonely and wanted some company now and then. I never saw anyone visit her except for her nurse which would check on her once a week and do some light housecleaning. When it came to her requests for electronics assistance, it was almost always the same thing. She would knock on my door and complain that her tv was stuck on a blue screen. 

I remember asking her if she called her cable provider to see if they could send a technician out to fix the cable box. “You know I can’t trust those bastards,” Sylvia spat while pointed a stiff and bony finger towards the outside world. “They’re just trying to charge me for more of their bullshit. I bet the repairman will snoop around for anything he can steal from me while he’s at it.” After Sylvia finished her mini tirade, I breathed a sigh and agreed to help her once again. 

We entered her apartment, littered with hideous old decorations themed around cats, while her actual cat hissed at me and scurried into one of the back rooms. Sylvia pointed me towards her living room, despite me being in her apartment plenty of times before, and sure enough, her tv showed nothing but the same default blue screen you’d see when you put it in the AV setting. 

“Did you hit the AV button on your remote by accident again?” I asked her in an attempt to troubleshoot the issue. “No, I don’t think so,” Sylvia said as if she were trying to recall a friend’s name from 50 years ago. “I was just watching my program and suddenly the screen just went blue again.” 

Nodding my head, I proceeded towards the massive entertainment center that housed her tv and cable box. Everything seemed perfectly fine. Not a single thing was out of place. Feeling frustrated about being called to fix a nonexistent problem, and desperate to have some free home entertainment, I quickly tampered with the box so that I could use her cable connection in my own apartment. 

There was a loud pop from the tv that bolted me upward and slammed the top of my head onto the roof of the little compartment containing the cable box. Sylvia’s episode of Days of our Lives began to play on the nearly deafening volume her tv was constantly on so she could hear it. Ignoring me rubbing the top of my skull, Sylvia gasped with excitement. “Thank you so much for your help, dearie.” She said smiling from ear to ear. “I would give you some money for the trouble, but I haven’t been to the bank yet. Would you take a check?” “That’s really not necessary, Sylvia,” I said shaking off the last of my headache. “I’m just happy I could help.” With that, we said our goodbyes and I made my way to my apartment, determined to take a brief nap before continuing my dissertation. 

I sat in front of my computer monitor trying to find a way to combat the case of writer’s block I had come down with after hours of typing my dissertation. I had chosen the ambitious subject of the theoretical physics of black holes. I thought my topic was a clever choice, since most of my colleagues were writing theirs on the decision to remove Pluto’s status as a planet. My paper was sure to stand out and hopefully impress my professors. What I didn’t realize, however, is that this subject was extremely difficult to write about without seeming like some kind of conspiracy theorist or follower of pseudoscience. 

After another hour of staring at my Word document in hopes that inspiration will breathe new life into my work, I finally gave up, hit save, backed my progress onto my flash drive, and resigned to the kitchen. I put a bag of popcorn into the microwave and grabbed a beer from the fridge. I twisted the top off the bottle and took a small swig while the popcorn finished cooking. In a few minutes, I had my snack in a bowl and sat myself on the dingy futon couch, a living relic from my college days, and decided it was time to test out my efforts at stealing Sylvia’s cable. 

To my surprise, my mini heist worked like a charm. After a moment of black screen, my tv was alive with the sounds and pictures of a football game. Not really being a sports guy, I decided to start flipping through the channels to find the TV Guide channel. I saw glimpses of old black and white movies, game shows, local news, and even an episode of the Simpsons before finally finding TV Guide. It looked like there was a documentary on NASA’s Swift Satellite playing on National Geographic.

For those who don’t know, the Swift Satellite captured data on a cosmic explosion known as a hybrid gamma-ray burst. This explosion was theorized to be a signal of a black hole being born. Thinking this would be a perfect source of information for my research, I entered the channel number on my remote, and ran to my desk to grab a pen and notepad. It looks like I made it just in time to hear an expert in the field of astrophysics give an explanation on the data gathered, when suddenly the tv changed from the documentary to a solid blue screen. The exact same one that was on Sylvia’s tv earlier that day. 

I was a mix of shocked and annoyed at the sudden change. Leaning more towards annoyed, I let out a groan and got up to check the tv. I thought if I gave it a good smack, it would go right back to the documentary. The only problem was that I couldn’t move. Despite all my efforts to lift myself off of the couch, I couldn’t. It was as if some unknown force had me pinned down by the shoulders. All I could do was stare into the blue screen. As I fell into this trance, I could hear a faint whisper coming from the speakers. It sounded welcoming, almost matronly, similar to a mother encouraging a child to try riding a bike for the first time. I felt my senses start to leave me as I became lulled into the voice’s charm. 

I could make out what sounded like words, but they weren’t of any language I could understand. It sounded like a language not of this plane of existence, yet also sounded so familiar. While my mind couldn’t comprehend what these whispers were, I understood what they were saying as if it were my true native tongue. The whisper began to drop its matronly tone, and now sounded distorted. As if a chaotic choir of voices were all chanting various incantations simultaneously. The voices began to crescendo until I wasn’t sure what would blow out first, my tv speakers, or my eardrums. The last thing I saw before losing consciousness was my reflection in the blank tv screen as it abruptly powered off of its own accord. 

I woke up a few hours later with a splitting headache. It felt like the worst hangover of my life amplified by a thousand. I looked around my living room to regain my bearings. My popcorn bowl spilled all over the floor and my beer was spilled on the coffee table. I muttered a curse to myself, and made my way into the kitchen to grab some paper towels and my vacuum cleaner. I took a glance at the microwave to check the time while I was there. It was 3:15am. After muttering another curse about the late hour, and vowing to go straight to bed, I set out to clean the mess in the living room. 

I wiped up the beer first to prevent any smells or sticky spots on the coffee table. Vacuuming the popcorn proved to be a much more annoying task. After getting the bulk of it off the floor, I moved on to getting the stray kernels on the couch. That’s when I came across my pen and notepad. 

The notepad looked like something was written on it. The only problem being that I didn’t remember making any notes before the blue screen. But sure enough, it was my handwriting on the previously blank page. How could I have written if I couldn’t move my body? I picked the pad up to examine the writing closer. 

Almost none of it was legible. I could only see strange symbols and markings that looked like an unorganized series of sketches and scribbles scattered on all parts of the paper. Almost no blank space remained. There were only two things on the page that my brain could properly process: The first was a drawing of some strange vertical prism drawn with a precision beyond my typically mediocre drawing skills. The second was two words in the center of the paper, circled and underlined almost to the point of ripping through to the page underneath: “It Awakens”.
