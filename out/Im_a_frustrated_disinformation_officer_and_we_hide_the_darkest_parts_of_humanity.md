CW TAGS: mentions of gorey crime scenes, brutality, and i guess, morbid reality?

So, I'm just about to enter work today and I guess, I want to know if what I am going through is creepy or not.

I am a disinformation officer. For any of you who aren't familiar, it's someone who provides information out there that can be interpreted wrongly by a certain population. I will try to keep the nature of my work that brief because I cannot risk getting fired, I still have bills to pay. Industry hmmmm, let's just say security and journalism. I termed it business media but focused on security consulting. (If it sounds confusing, yes it is)

Anyway, the information we gather on the internet lets us define through statistics and data analytics what certain individuals will know about the reality of a situation and potential foresight on what will happen. We predict creepy stuff but, that's a story for another time...

I want to talk about the times when we find information that is so unreasonable it makes you question if such a thing is even possible to occur. So, irrational. That you feel like just knowing about this ritual happening or that execution happening in that place sends a chill up your spine because you know, there's more to it than just a death. So immoral. That you question if goodness exists, gives you a good pitfall down to the absurdity and meaninglessness of life - I mean why will I even try to change the world if yesterday there were three children sacrificed for -----again I'm getting ahead of myself. I will list down specific incidents that we just placed in the folder named: DO NOT REPORT - REDACT IF SEEN ONLINE. There are plenty of things I will retract to cover any leads about them. Rest assured, some...."allies" of the corporation I am working on have seized web operations already for any source links reported. Again. \*whispers\* We Are Everywhere. Lol just kidding, I'm just their corporate slave that's why I'm fucking writing this. Fuck them.

On \[ REDACTED \] local sources reported a pyramid of human heads in the town square of \[ REDACTED \]. Local investigators mentioned that the park was closed for the past week due to a land mine clearance by the military. The human heads were pointed towards the direction of the local elder \[ REDACTED \]. The location of the local elder remains unknown.

On \[ REDACTED - different date continuing incident update \] security forces attempted to arrest three individuals charged with drug possession, weapons cache possession, public intoxication, and human trafficking in \[ REDACTED - close to the previous location by 1 km \]. Upon initial arrest, a member of the group assaulted the arresting soldier. (we don't describe gruesome details for incident reporting but let me tell you, that soldier was cut into three pieces this brute of a criminal, this was actually a video online that we caught early on and deleted fuuuuuuuuuuq that was close, tied this soldier with his hands and legs, imagine tying a knot with one of your legs and one of your arms and whatever cracks, cracks...it wasn't the cracking that sent me over the edge there, it was the screams - that soldier...cried like a prey, like it felt poached by some human that will use him somewhere or just leave him dead after they are done playing) The assault led to further altercations resulting in the death of 4 soldiers with 1 leaving the scene. Additional reinforcements were called on. No one was found at the scene of the crime.

On \[ REDACTED - 1 day after \] local commander of \[ REDACTED - the district in question \] announced that rumors regarding the massacre of soldiers last \[ REDACTED - previous date \] should cease in preparation for the bestowing ceremony of new local elder \[ REDACTED \].

On \[ REDACTED - a week before the ceremony \] 13 children went missing in the town of \[ REDACTED - yes same town \]. Local authorities are conducting search-and-rescue operations pending potential terrorist/militia movement in the area.

In a meeting with the council of elders of the town of \[ REDACTED \], the local elder \[ REDACTED - different from the first elder \] announced that residents are restricted from entering the town square of \[ REDACTED \] on the day of the bestowing ceremony.

On \[ REDACTED - the night before the ceremony \] gunshots and explosions were heard in the outskirts of \[ REDACTED - same town \]. Local authorities investigated the area and found 4 insurgents decapitated. The camp was littered with \[ REDACTED - a militant group \] paraphernalia, weapons, and \[ REDACTED - a mining resource, idk why they brought these \]. (another thing we don't describe is the gruesome configurations of crime scenes,,,the pyramid one was a bit strange but only because there's really no sugarcoating what happened there, there was a fucking pyramid of heads but here, the four decapitated heads were formed into a square or diamond or whatever, in the middle of the square, was the said mining resource,,, I don't wanna say it since, I know there are professionals out there that can track where this place is and quite frankly we don't want you looking into them through some GPS) Local authorities asked \[ REDACTED - a prominent political leader in the area \] to provide additional security in the area prompting increasing terrorist activity.

.....and basically, that leads us to today, the ceremony is today and you guys never get to know. We delete it, simple as that. There are close calls here and there. Some we just make up for fun lol. But really, I'm just here for the good pay.

I have plenty more stories to get to. You can ask for updates or topics that may relate to this. Or any AMA really. Yes, I am being vague because I want to remain anonymous. No, I'm not stupid for spilling all these coz, the disinformation cycle creates more disinformation. I may be telling you lies or they may be truths. The fact of the matter is, they don't care - you can't do anything to stop them. I technically am working for them if I do this. Maybe I should get a raise...
