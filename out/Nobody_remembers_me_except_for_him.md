My name is Philip, chances are you don’t know me… actually you definitely don’t know me. Let me explain….

I’m a 26 year old man, but when I was four I mean fi- I can’t remember. My mom told me when I was a little kid I used to have this imaginary friend who I would call “the man with no nose” and I had a well established rule that if he didn’t get to play with toys nor did I, if he didn’t get food then I wouldn’t eat mine, I think you get the idea. Anyway flash to today September 27th 2023, and I don’t remember anything about him, I only know about him because my mom recently told me, and she wanted to know if I remembered him too.

Yesterday I came into work, my coworker Becky stood behind the counter, “welcome to summerstone cafe, can I start you off with anything?” I looked behind me to see if someone was in line, there wasn’t. “Nope, just gotta clock in real quick.” I replied, “oh! Did you just start working here? I’ve never seen you before” said becky, I chuckled “very funny” I said sarcastically, she looked a little offended but didn’t say anything I walked past her to the back of the cafe, I punched my name into the computer “error, try again” I did it again, same thing “error, try again” I definitely know how to spell my own name, so I found the manager and told him my situation, “did you make sure you spelt it correctly” he said cockily, “of course I can spell my own name” I responded, “are you sure you pressed enter?” He said, “I’m not stupid” I replied “mkay, let me take a look” he punched his name into the computer, (Robert Quill) “seeeee, works like a charm. Stop making excuses to work or else I’ll have to fire you… whoever you are” I never really comprehended the last three words until now.

 Anyway after that whole fiasco, I decided to head back home, whilst driving back home I decided to call my mom *buzzzz… buzzzz…  buz-* “hello, this is Claire” says mom over the phone “hey mom! I’ve had a rough week and figured-“ “sorry hun this ain’t your mom” she hung up, “damn it…” I mumbled to myself. A couple minutes later I was getting a call back, or that’s what I thought, until I noticed it was from an ‘unknown number’,I let it ring but ended up picking up cause why not. I heard a monotone man probably around my age quietly whispering “you did this to me… you did this to me, Philip. I’m gonna find you…” he hung up. 

Flash forward to right now, I’m hiding in my closet as things are being thrown around my house the police are saying my house isn’t showing up on the map but to stay calm. They asked me to describe the man and I said “he’s tall, very tall, pale I couldn’t see his pupils, and most notably…. His nose is missing”
