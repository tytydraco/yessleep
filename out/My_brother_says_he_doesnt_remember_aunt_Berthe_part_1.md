My brother pretends he has no memory of our great great aunt Berthe. 

 I can't even put words on it.Imagine you suddenly discover that your most vivid childhood memories weren't real... I'm terrified.

 I'm not new to being in a dark place. I've had it pretty rough growing up... So rough actually that working a graveyard job and writing or chatting with you all has been more than enough for me until now.I've never expected much from life so ... I was pretty content about renting my own place, watching movies and the occasional tinder date. 
I'd cut ties with most of my past acquaintainces. I'd kind of vanished from existence. Untill the call. 
My brother's call.... Dad was dead. 

HonnestlY... It's not like I really cared. I was surprised, I admit,because I had never thought about my family's mortality. Not until my great great aunt's death when I was a kid at least, but she was so old... it was different. 
My brother... On the other end ... He didn't take it as well. 
I'm the youngest you see... So... I don't remember much about dad. He is kind of an anecdote for me. A faded polaroid picture on a wall. I can't really blame him, he never wanted me in the first place and I was the first nail in his marriage's coffin. 

My mom was very young when they met.She was almost immediatly pregnant with my brother. He was not happy about it but he really tried to make it work despite his family's deep concern. You see.. My father's from a rural place. I'd say a community but ... Is it the word when 99% of the people have gone to the city or died? 

My father's french. He came here to study but he was born and raised in a small mining town in the moontains. It used to thrive in the 50's but since the coal mine closed... It's changed a lot. Don't think my ancestors were minors. I mean... They were. But they were there before the mines.

 They hid in those mountains for centuries so they could practice their religion in peace away from the protestants' and heretics' massacres. When my grandfather decided to build the house on the stepped plot of land he'd inherited from his father, there were no roads , no telephone , no water, nothing. 

Our ancestral house stands on top of a hill, surrounded by thorns , chestnut trees and some miserable rotting vineyards. The old stones so crumbled he never thought about living in it himself. He was happy to let the whole place to aunt Berthe. Although she only used her own side of the property. His great aunt. She was already old when he started building a new house in the 70's but you know... People used to be very old pretty young back then. When grey hair ran wild on old crone's head, teeth fell unreplaced and eyes went white from old age. Time had no grip on my ancestor's land. Tv, radio and its commercials weren't there to change my great aunt's old ways. 

My parents divorced when I was 7 and my brother 10 ... of course... my mother got the house and my father moved back in with is parents. For two years, until She went back to the US with us, we visited my father every holiday. I met aunt Berthe during the first Christmas at my grandfather's house. 

I don't remember much about the first days there except my brother wouldn't play with me and grandpa was mean. Today I understand that my brother was deeply upset about not being with both our parents on christmas day and really hurt that my mother would go back to Boston without us. I know that today, but my seven year old self? He was devastated. 

I started to explore my grandparents property. It seemed unending back then. My grandfather had worked hard to make a proper garden around his house.It was fun to climb the trees and roll in the grass with the dogs, but I couldn't help glancinhg at the ancient stone building at the top of the hill. It lurked over my grandfather's modernhouse half hiden behind a century old chestnut tree. a narrow path on the side of the hill's top lead to it but it was abandonned and overgrown with weeds and thisles. 

I felt like an explorator among the tall grasses, climbing toward that the sombre house. When I reached it, I was both marvelled and intimidated. It almost looked like a castle.  A weird castle. It had towers. an arch lead to a courtyard where the stairs lead to the different appartements. . I'd never seen a place like that before. 

 I was leaning against the big stones of the arch when a soft voice reached me. At first I didn't understand it. I recognized the accent. It was my grandfather's native tongue, occitan. 

" Hi little man, I was wondering when I'd meet you at last.". I entered the courtyard and  looked up. At the top of the stairs stood an old woman. She wore a grey thick skirt and a beige wool cardigan. She seemed to wear a light blue apron under the cardigan too. " I'm aunt Berthe" she said revieling a teethless mouth. " Do you want to come with me? It's time to feed the animals". 

Of course I wanted to. She showed me the goats, the chickens and the rabbits. I had not had fun like that in a very long time and I was really disappointed when I heard my father's voice calling me from the bottom of the hill. " run little guy run, otherwhise he won't be happy.". " He is never happy anyway" I pouted. " Yes, little man, but if he gets really angry he'll let the carac take you!". She sprang on me menacingly and tickled me. “ You can come back tomorrow”. 

I ran home very excited to tell to everybody all the cool things I’d done with Aunt Berthe but I didn’t get the time. As I arrived , breathless at the feet of my father down the narrow path, he slapt me so hard that I fell. “  You’ve been making us all wait! When I call you , you come right away!”. I held back my tears. Crying was the worse thing to do when he was in this kind of mood. I hid for most of the day in the pages of my book. At night, I wanted to tell my brother but he already was asleep when I remembered about the goats, the rabbits and the chickens. 

The next morning I almost jumped from my bed. I wanted to tell Mike really badly about Aunt Berthe; but his bed was empty and my grandmother told me that everybody had just lef the house. They went to the farm to get new chickens, maybe a pig. I almost cried. They never waited for me nor asked me if I wanted to go. Right then and there I decided that Mike shouldn't know about the animals and aunt Berthe. He didn't deserve to. I was about to ask my grandma if I could go back to Berthe's place but she was already gone. I was old enough to make my own breakfast now she had said to my father. 


Aunt Berthes was hanging white sheets on a clothing line behind the house when I came by again. " Right on time" she said smiling. I don't why but I ran to hug her. " Careful! The worms". I stopped. " The worms?" "Yes , yes the silk worms", " come inside, I'll show you". I followed her in the courtyard and above the stairs. Aprehension built in the pit of my stomach when I reached the first level of the building. It didn't seem... Right... Stones rolled under my feet and weeds grew between the deep cracks between the stones. I was about to ask her when she suddenly knelt and shushed me. " Look , here, by the window". In front of us, a broken window gave inside the small tower. There was a small tabby cat. Instinctly I walked towards it and it hissed before slipping in the darkness. 
" it's a wild cat! He is sacred. He knows the old ways.". She shuckled "we all do here". Come , let me show you your room!". There was an other set of stairs, more narrow and unstable than the big stares.The cracks seemed filed with bugs of all sorts and dandelions sprouted between each steps. At the top there was a door. Its rotten wood smelled and the red paint had scaled. She opened the door. It wasn't really a house. A lot of things dried on strings nailed between walls. The furniture were splintered and the chair's straw molded. " Don't be shy! Come in! It's been so long I haven't seen anyone". 

I entered and sat on of the chairs, as asked. Finally, it wasn't that bad here, there was a good fire in the chimney and Aunt Berthe warmed fresh goat milk on the stove for me. It smelled but I was polite and didn't say it did. She showed me the silworms she held in her aprons at all time. She showed me the cocoons too. " You seem to enjoy yourself " she remarked gladly " Oh yes! Can we go see the animals ? ". She smiled. Of course we can, She took a long knife.  " We have to honnor the white lady today you know". " The white lady?" , " Of course don't you know what day it is today?" I didn't.... "It's the shortest day of the year".

 She made me walk in front of her on the way below. I heard the cat growl behind the thick wall when we passed under the broken window. I was uneasy once again... The big knife felt too close to my head. She hobbled behind me humming in occitan. The whole structure creaked and howled with the wind. Something was wrong but I couldn't really tell what. 
Outside , the goats park didn't seem as big and full as I remembered. An old black billy goat stared at me , immobile. I didn't like this one. His eyes seemed fake. Empty. As if they were hiding something. When he didn't move , and he didn't much, it was like ... Like he wasn't alive but just a thing. A thing watching me. I focused my attention on my favourite goat.

 It was still a kid, all white with soft eyes and a pink nose. 
Aunt Berthe gave me a golden collar. It was in metal but obviously painted. She showed me how to lock it around the creature's neck and gave me the golden chain. I felt proud that she trusted me with the goat. I let it graze. It was so happy, its little tail was waving madly. Aunt Berthe disappeared a while but I didn't mind as I observed and petted the goat. 

She called me from the courtyard and I came. She had drawn something on the stones under her feet. Like a mandala . But ... it was red and... And the I saw the beheaded rooster in her left hand. Her apron was stained. She made a sign. I looked at the young animal at the end of the golden chain. I walked toward her. Once I was in the circle she started laughing and clapping, baring her toothless gums. Twirling under the white winter sky. She held the black rooster's neck up to her lips and suddenly spat on my face the warm blood. Petrified I looked up as she lifted the knife upon my head. I closed my eyes tight before it could lower. Instead of the blade , I felt a warm hand on my forehead and a kiss upon my head " You"re a good boy" She said. 

A highpitched scream made me open my eyes. I didn't have the time to understand what was happening that I was flung violently on the other side of the arch. Blood and tears made me unable to see much but I knew it was Mike. He took my hand and we ran, as fast as we could down the twisted little path. Screaming. When my father saw us, saw me, covered in blood, he went in to grab the shot gun. I cried so hard I don't remember what happened next. Just crying, being scrubbed violently with boiling water. I suppose I fell asleep shorly after... I remember staying in and watching tv all day with grandma the next days, trying no to think about aunt Berthe and the animals. I was worried for the goat... Was she going to kill it? I though about it ... Christmas came and I was worried. So I went to my grandma.

"Grandma... Will aunt Berthe be here too today?" She looked at me , puzzled. " Who?", " Aunt Berthe! " I repeated gesturing toward the old house on the hill. " Didn't your father tell you? She is not there anymore Darling." " When did she leave ? " My grandma put a hand on my forehead, sighed and gave me a half smile. " She was too old, she just ... went to heaven. ". My mouth opened but I stayed silent. Why did nobody ever tell me things? Things always happened and I was never ever told When they happened nor why. I might only be told just after, once I couldn't do anything anymore. Maybe I wanted to go to the funeral ! 

I didn't want my family to see how hurt I was. They always teased me if they knew I was disappointed or sad.  " What about the worms? The animals ? Who'll take care of them? " "The silkworms??" she sounded really surprised. " Silkworms need a special tree to eat and it's rare to see one now... But grandpa takes care of the animals upthere don't wory , they're not left alone.". 

I went back to my room where Mike was playing on his gameboy color. " I'm going to the cemetary to see aunt Berthe. Do you want to come?" I was not expecting it but he came. 

I've told you earlier that we were part of a community who'd come to the mountains to live their religion safe from the catholics. For this reason, we had our own private cemetary in the woods. Grandma came pretty often clean the forgotten tumbstones. I knew I would find her grave there. 

On my way I'd collected the best looking pinecones and disposed them on the ground, under the rusted cross. " Where you there ?" I asked my brother. He was a few feet away, looking at a spider near the gate. " There where?" " at her funeral ? ". He came nearer. " See this date ? " " yes" " It's her birthdate. I read, aloud, "September the 9th 1889" . " And this one?" " yes" "It's her death, december the 22nd 1973". "Oh..." ... I hesitated. " I think it's another Berthe..." I breathed. " What do you mean?" " The old woman... In the old house. Maybe it's her daughter and they just have the same name... " What old woman? " he snarked. " You saw her last week !!" He became pale. ".  Dad told me we should never talk about that day ever again. YOU UNDERSTAND !?" he shouted so loud , so suddenly, that I started crying immediatly. " You're such a baby" he growled, leaving. 

So... Here's everything I remember about that last christmas with my paternal grandparents. When Mike called me, I immediatly asked him if he'd be burried in the old cemetary in the woods. " What do you think? " He answered coldly. It was hard to understand his hurt. Despite the distance and the awful way he treated us , he'd stayed close to dad. I'd stopped talking to him in my teenage years and never thought twice about it... So... I'm heading back there tomorrow. That's why I can't sleep tonight ... I have to go back to the house. I'm sure I'll be able to find a death certificate or something. Maybe my brother will finally accept to talk about that cold december morning in the crumbling in the courtyard. Maybe grandma will be able to tell me more about Aunt Berthe...
