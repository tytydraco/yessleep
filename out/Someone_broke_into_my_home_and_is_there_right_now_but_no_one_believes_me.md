“Hungry again?”

“Huh?” I muted my cell phone, because I’m that guy who holds up the line at Chipotle while talking on my cell phone. 

The squeaky-voiced teen smiled awkwardly and scratched his arm. “Um. Well, how – how can I help you?”

“Hang on,” I spoke into my phone before remembering that it was muted, unmuted it, and then hung up. “I’ll have a bowl with steak and queso.”

“And double guac?”

I froze, an unsettling chill running down my spine. “How the hell did you know that?”

He eyed me wearily. “That will be $19.13. Um, our card reader doesn’t work, but the ATM does.”

I withdrew my hand from my pocket, no longer caring how many other pissed off people were in line behind me. “How did you know everything I was about to say?” I demanded.

His eyes bulged. “I’m sorry, sir. It’s time for my break.”

“If I knew how my car had been *stolen*, why would I need to involve the *police*?” I demanded, hoping the officer realized that I was losing my patience. 

“Sir,” he shot back, giving me attitude, “I’m just asking where you left your keys. It’s a pretty standard question in this situation.”

I jammed my hands into my pocket. “The same place I *always* leave them, Officer Dum…” my voice trailed off as I realized that my keys were gone. 

He closed his notebook and folded his arms. “Maybe one of your friends borrowed the car. Is there any chance that someone knows more than they’re telling you?”

“Yes, the day just got better, Myrtle!” My hand was shaking as I held the phone close to my mouth. “You always give me shit about playing the lottery, and BOOM – five thousand bucks! I’m heading into the Chevron station to cash it in right now!”

Hanging up before my girlfriend could respond, I stared at the irritated cashier who had been waiting for me to finish my phone call. 

“Can I help you?”

“You can help me five thousand times over!” I announced, reaching for my wallet.

Then my stomach dropped. “Um – I put the ticket in my wallet… I got four out of six numbers, it was pretty fucking… did I leave it in the car?”

“Sir,” he responded, annoyed, “trying to cash out a *second* time, for this dollar amount, is a felony. Please leave the premises or I’ll involve the police.”

Anxiety had turned to raw fear by the time I walked back to the apartment I share with Myrtle. Had I lost my mind? The entire world seemed to know what I was thinking, and was determined to use that to fuck me over. 

I stopped at the front entrance to the Monterey Lanai apartments and stared at the blue-green Corolla parked in front. 

*My* blue-green Corolla.

I ran upstairs without breathing. “MYRTLE!” I screamed as I burst in the unlocked door. Head spinning, I ran into the bedroom, terrified that I would find her dead body on our bed.

She was smiling at me from beneath sheets pulled up to her neck, her auburn hair frizzy and disheveled. “Someone’s excited,” she grinned. “Where’s all this energy coming from? It’s been months since we’ve had afternoon sex, and you look ready for round two!”

*

I ran outside to cry. I can be an asshole sometimes, and Myrtle defines the notion of “better half.” But how could she comfort me now? Either the rest of the world had collectively lost their minds, or I had. Either way, she was on the other side of ‘crazy’ from where I stood. 

“Sorry about your car.”

I looked up to see my black sweater covering a man in my frayed jeans over my running shoes as he smoked my Camels. He had my haircut. He had my face.

I didn’t understand the notion of *fear* until that moment. Before then, I had only ever been ‘scared.’

“A few people noticed the difference,” he continued without looking at me as he blew out a long stream of smoke. “Subtle shit, like the way I stood, or the fact that you’re a bigger dick than I thought.” He finally turned my way. Locking his ice-blue eyes with mine was like staring into a fucked-up mirror. “Your doctor assumed we were twins. Minh, your boss, thought the same thing.” He folded his arms and flashed a smile that dripped with malice. “Myrtle, though – she didn’t notice a thing.” He laughed. “And believe me, I gave her *multiple* opportunities to notice.”

I was on my feet before realizing my own intent to attack. To be honest, I had no specific plan, but would probably have cracked his skull if it weren’t for the gun. 

“Ah-ah-ah!” he warned, stepping back and pulling a Glock from his waistband.

*My* Glock. The one I keep tucked behind the headboard of the bed I share with Myrtle. 

“Science really has come a long way. Hasn’t it, Gary?” He stepped closer, the barrel still aimed at my chest. “Tell me – given how far A. I. has come, do you really think that the world’s governments *haven’t* experimented with our DNA?” He flashed my own smile back to me. “Technically, that would make us twins. But… I don’t know, I just don’t feel that fraternal connection. Do you, Gary? No, you don’t – and I would know. ‘Twins’ is the wrong word. I much prefer ‘doppelganger.’” He licked his lips. 

I fought back tears and vomit. “So… you have my DNA? All of it?”

He shrugged and smiled. 

“Including my congenital patella dislocation?”

I’d maintained enough eye contact so that he didn’t see my fast, low kick, but he sure as shit felt it. I opted run without reaching for the gun; I knew the pain in his knee would distract him for hours, and I didn’t want to get close to an erratic trigger finger. 

I didn’t get in the Corolla, because I don’t have the keys. I didn’t buy a bus ticket, because I don’t have my wallet. And I didn’t call the cops. Think about it: he would claim that we were twins, he has my keys and wallet, and the officer on duty in our small town would be able to distinguish between the two of us by my clothes.

I, of course, would be the one who’d pissed him off earlier in the day. 

My doppelganger has been ten steps ahead of me the whole time. I’ve run into the forest behind my apartment and am trying to figure out what the hell to do next. With no wallet or keys, my phone should have been enough.

Except that all of my contacts have blocked my number. 

I have no friends other than strangers on the internet. I'm in hiding, but don't know how long I'll be safe.

See, I thought I was well hidden.

But I just checked behind a nearby tree.

Someone left freshly smoked Camel cigarettes within eyesight of where I’m hiding.
