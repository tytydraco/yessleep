Growing up everyone is told about the Boogeyman. Saying the Boogeyman will catch you and how he’s in the dark. We’ve all heard the famous song about the Boogeyman. “Hush. Hush. Hush. Here comes the Boogeyman. Don’t let him come to close to you he’ll catch you if he can”. And how so many tales and movies and stories were made about the Boogeyman. But no one ever believes it. It’s just to scare children to go to sleep or scare them in general. I mean like what kind of name is “Boogeyman”? Right? But I learned something terrifying one night. Something about the Boogeyman. 

10 years ago

It was a Thursday evening. My mom works at the hospital so sometimes she comes home late. So home alone late a lot. My parents recently got a divorce so like I said i’m home alone. One day it was storming all day and we’ve been getting all sorts of severe thunderstorms warning possible tornado watch. Nothing big like a tornado happens around here. In fact nothing happens around here. It’s a nice normal town. Little strange how normal it is. I’m watching tv then I get call. It’s from my mom, I answer it. “Hello?” I say “Hey Alex, it’s Mom. I’m not going to be home tonight. The hospital needs me plus the roads are very dangerous. If something is wrong call me. There is dinner leftovers from last night or you can make something. I’ll be home first thing in the morning.” “Ok mom love you” “love you to bye” then I hang up. I go to fridge and heat up some left over pizza we got last night. The night is normal still storming as I head to bed. It’s around 10:30 when I go upstairs to sleep. 

During the night I wake up, I don’t know why then I hear a faint singing or song playing. I open my door and I hear my Dad’s old record player he left here for me since I love playing songs on it. But this song wasn’t one of my songs. Or a song I’ve heard my Dad play. As I go down the hallway I hear the song it sings “Children have you ever met the Boogeyman before? No of course you haven’t for your much to good i’m sure. Don’t you be afraid of him if he should visit you. He’s a great big coward so i’ll tell you what to do: Hush hush hush. Here’s comes the Boogeyman. Don’t let him come to close to you he’ll catch you if he can.” Then the music trails off for a bit. I stand at the top of the stairs but see nothing. Then the song plays, “Hush Hush. Here comes the Boogeyman” then it stops again. I get chills and a bit freaked out. 

I quietly go downstairs looking around for anything. I swear from the stairs I see through the garage door window, something tall and slim standing there. I quietly go down the last few steps and peak through the window and see nothing. Maybe I was just getting paranoid and my imagination saw something not really there. Then the song plays “He’s a great big coward” then stops again. I slowly and quietly make my way over to the kitchen while the words “Hush Hush Hush” keeps playing in my head. I see nothing then hear a door creak open I turn around and see the basement door opened. I gulp. I tip toe over to the basement door and see that same tall slim figure with a hat. I gasp and jump back and then look back at the basement and see he’s gone. Then the song plays again “Don’t you be afraid of him” then it stops. I try to convince myself it’s just a dream so I try going back to my room. I go up the stairs and peak through the railing and see it looking at me from my moms bedroom. I try to quietly go up the stairs back to my room then I hear the bedroom door slam shut so I make a run for my bedroom and I shut my door.

Then I hear the song playing and my door flies open and I see the Boogeyman on its hands and knees with his head tilted looking at me and the song starts playing “He’ll catch you if he can” then it keeps replaying “Catch you if he” as he slowly moves closer to me. I try to move but i’m paralyzed in fear. Then right as he’s about to me the front door opens and I hear my mom walk in. In one swift movement he’s at the top of the stairs and he puts his hat on the shelf at the top of the stairs. “Mom” I call out as i’m finally able to move. “How was your night?” she says to me while walking up the stairs “and who’s hat is that?” she ask.
