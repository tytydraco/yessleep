They say when you retire, your past catches up with you.

For most guys I worked with, that just meant divorce papers or old back injuries. But me?
I keep thinking about a stretch of highway around Front Royal, Virginia.

Two-lane blacktop, maybe twelve miles total. Covered in trees and brush on both sides like most rural highways in Warren County. Nothing special. But I cleaned that road for twelve years.

Picked up raccoons, deer, the occasional unlucky dog. I knew every curve, every mile marker, every dip where the fog clung low in the mornings.

And I swear to heaven above, something out there wasn’t right. I’d seen a lot over those years, but there was one time—one thing—I can’t explain.

I’m not one to talk about this sort of thing. Hell, I’m not even the kind of guy that thinks about this sort of thing. But now that I’m retired, out here in Arizona with nothing but time, dry air, and no trees—I figure maybe it’s time to get it off my chest. You don’t have to believe me. I wouldn’t blame you if you didn’t.

All I know is, something was taking those bodies before I could get to them. And it wasn’t any predator I’d seen before.

Back then, my mornings all started the same. Coffee in a thermos. Local country station on low. Clipboard with the day’s calls tucked between the seats. I had a route, and I stuck to it. I truly was always a creature of habit. County sent in roadkill reports through dispatch—citizens would call, or a deputy would log it, and I’d swing by to clean it up before it started to stink or attract scavengers.

Most days it was just me, the road, and the buzz of cicadas. Peaceful work, really. Gross sometimes, yeah—but it gave me time to think. Or not think, which some days was just as good.

Only thing you never really get used to is the smell. Hot, rotting meat on asphalt.

But around the spring of that year, something changed.

It started with a buck that got clipped out by mile marker 112. I remember it clear because it was supposed to be a “messy one,” according to the report. When I pulled up, there was nothing. No fur, no bone fragments, no chunks. Just a cracked bit of plastic in the ditch—part of a busted headlight maybe. The only thing left of that deer was a wet spot on the road—but no deer.

I figured maybe a local had come and dragged it off for meat. Wouldn’t be the first time. Folks out that way didn’t waste much. So I checked it off and kept going.

Next day? Same thing. Possum outside of Riverton called in around 6 a.m. I was there by 6:30—nothing. Not even a bloodstain.

Three days in a row. Then five. Then more.

It got to the point where every time I showed up, there was nothing left to clean.

At first, I thought maybe someone else was doing my job. New hire, maybe? County loves not telling you when they make a change. I called my supervisor, Tracy, to ask.

“You get beat to it again?” she laughed. “Nope. Far as I know, you’re still the only one with a strong enough stomach to do it. Maybe the vultures got ambitious.”

Except vultures don’t carry away full-grown deer without leaving so much as a stain.

Still, I didn’t push it. Less cleanup meant more coffee breaks. I got to sit longer in the shade, maybe sneak a little nap here and there. I wasn’t about to complain.

But then the calls stopped altogether.

A week went by with no assignments. Then two. Tracy called me in and said the county was “re-evaluating the budget.”

That’s when I started to worry.

I still remember her words:
“If there ain’t nothin’ to clean, we might not need someone on salary to not clean it.”

Funny how fast peace turns to panic.

About a week after that talk with Tracy, I started getting nervous. Not just about the job—about the silence.

See, the woods never go completely quiet out here. Even when there’s no cars, no birds—there’s always something. Wind in the trees, bugs in the grass. But lately, there’d been mornings where the whole world felt… paused. Like the trees were holding their breath.

One morning, around 5:30, I took a different route out of habit. Just me, low beams, and a fog so thick it felt like I was pushing through it. No call had come through that day—nothing on the sheet—but I figured I’d check an old stretch out near the Shenandoah River turnoff anyway. Sometimes folks didn’t bother calling if it was small.

And sure enough, there it was.

A fox, I think. Hard to tell—it was half-twisted, bloody, fur slick with dew and road grime. I slowed to a crawl. Rolled the window down. Something about it made me feel… watched.

I was about to flip on the hazards when I saw movement in the fog.

Just ahead, barely ten yards from my bumper, something hunched low darted across the road and stopped—right over the body.

I froze.

Couldn’t see much—just a silhouette. Not a coyote. Not a man, either. Its limbs moved wrong. Too fast. Too twitchy.

I reached for the work light in the passenger seat, but by the time I clicked it on and swept it forward, the thing was gone. So was the fox.

Nothing but skid marks and a faint smear left behind.

I stepped out, slow. The air smelled like wet iron and something else… like rotting leaves. I don’t remember hearing a single sound—not even a cicada in a Virginia summer.

I stood there for a minute, listening.

Nothing.

When I got back in the truck, my hands were shaking just enough to make the keys rattle when I turned the ignition.

Didn’t say a word to Tracy. What would I even say?

But that was the first time I started to feel it deep in my bones—that something was out there, doing my job. And doing it too fast.

After that, I started carrying a flashlight bigger than my forearm and a tire iron under the seat. Felt silly. But not as silly as getting mauled by some backwoods freak of nature on a lonely stretch of road.

The next couple weeks were quiet. No calls. No sightings. No weirdness. I started thinking maybe I’d imagined it. Maybe it had been a coyote with mange. Brains play tricks—especially in fog.

Then came the night out by Morgan’s Ford.

I was driving home late—earlier than usual but still after dark—when I caught the glint of something off the shoulder. Not glass. Not reflection. Eyeshine.

It was hunched over a small body in the gravel. Looked like a raccoon. The thing raised its head and stared right at me. Eyes wide, unblinking. Its ribs showed through its sides, heaving like a bellows.

This time I didn’t fumble. I hit the brights and stepped out with the flashlight.

It didn’t run.

Didn’t growl either.

It stood up—not all the way—and backed off slow, watching me the whole time.

I crept forward, light steady in my hand, and that’s when I saw what it really was.

A mountain lion. Skinny, sick-looking. Ribs like piano keys. Eyes glassy, foam at the corners of its mouth.

It must’ve been dying. Starved half to death. That’s why it moved the way it did—low and twitchy, like its muscles didn’t know what to do.

I took a step back. It didn’t follow.

Just slunk off into the trees, dragging the raccoon like it couldn’t afford to leave a single scrap.

I watched the woods for a long time after that.

Eventually I got back in the truck, heart still racing, but something like relief settled in my gut.

Made sense, didn’t it? Big cat. Starving. Scavenging roadkill.

For a couple days, I even believed it.

But deep down, something still didn’t sit right. That cat didn’t move that fast. And it didn’t explain the fox that disappeared in front of me. Or why there was never a trace left behind.

Predators tear things up. That’s nature. Messy. Loud. Visceral.

Whatever took that fox hadn’t just been quiet.

It was silent.

There’s a little place just outside Front Royal called Darby’s. Cheap drinks, country songs on the jukebox, and a bartender who doesn’t ask too many questions. I wasn’t much of a drinker back then, but that night, I needed something to take the edge off.

Tracy had called earlier. Budget hearing next week. “No decisions made yet,” she said—which is how you know the decisions have already been made.

I sat at the far end of the bar nursing a bourbon. Not my usual, but beer felt too light for the mood I was in.

That’s when I noticed the kid.

Maybe twenty-three. Laughing too hard. Throwing back shots like he had something to prove. When he stumbled out with keys already in his hand, I waited a few minutes. Paid my tab. Made sure I wasn’t tailing him—just… keeping distance.

One second, everything was normal.

Next second, the light of an oncoming tractor trailer disappeared.

Then came the sound.

Metal. Screaming tires. Shattering glass.

I hit the brakes.

The kid had drifted lanes. Hit the truck head-on. His car was a cage of twisted steel and smoke. The truck cab was sideways across the road, one headlight dangling like a popped eye.

I grabbed the flashlight, called 911, and ran.

I was halfway there when I saw it—movement near the wreck.

A figure, tall and thin, crouched low, pulling something from the broken glass like it weighed nothing.

“Hey!” I shouted. “Do you need help?”

The figure turned. Slowly. Its face was wrong. Angled strange, like it had too many joints and not enough muscle.

Its voice was wet and hollow.

“No. Go back to your car.”

I stood frozen.

Then something moved behind it. Then another.

I never saw the hit. Just a flash of light and pain like lightning in my skull.

When I woke up, I was in the back of an ambulance.

The police asked what I saw. I told them half the truth. Enough to be believed. Enough to sleep that night.

Two weeks later, I requested reassignment.

A year after that, I retired.

Last week, I saw a news article from back home:

“Young Man Missing After Late-Night Crash on Route 340.”

Same road. Same vanishing act.

I hovered over the keyboard. Thought about reaching out. Thought about telling them what I saw that night.

But what would I say?

That there’s something out there collecting bodies—cleaning the roads like I used to?

I closed the laptop.

Made some coffee.

Stepped outside.

Started the car and started driving. I don’t plan on stopping until I find what’s been doing this.
