Hello there, just wanted to share my experience. So I was working until really late at night, until around 3am, and finally got off work. I was walking home, which was around a 30 minute walk from where I work, and was in a fairly empty area, with no one around, especially around this time in the night. I was around 15 minutes into the walk, when I saw a pair of headlights in the distance, but didn't think much of it, and was just listening to some music to keep myself entertained during my walk. Eventually I see the headlights coming closer, but I was on the side of the road, so I didn't really think too much of it at all. All of a sudden though, the driver swerved right off the road, and actually ended up hitting me really bad, at around 40 mph. After they hit me, I was hoping they'd stop and come to help me out, but considering that there was no one around that saw this happen, they saw the opportunity to just drive off, and that's exactly what they did. They left me to die alone late at night, in terrible pain. I was there for around 20 minutes, until I finally lost conciousness and ended up dying. 


Now normally you'd think that's it, but not for me. Somehow, after I died, I suddenly became a spirit, and was just looking at my corpse on the ground. I was so confused, and scared, because I didn't know what happened. But, after some time I figured it out, and was able to roam freely around bodyless. Now this is the really boring part now. For the next 6 years, I was literally just aimlessly wandering around without a body alone, unable to interact with anything or anyone. It felt so horrible, just endlessly wandering, just watching the world go by as I was a spirit. But then, I finally had an idea. I thought that maybe I'd be able to try to take over someone's body. However, I failed so many times, over and over and over. I failed probably over around a thousand times, until I found Anna. She was at the gym late at night alone, just working out. I thought it was the perfect opportunity! Well I found her at the gym alone late at night just working out. I saw there was no one around, so I immediately shot straight into her body entering it, and she bolted to the ground and began shaking and convulsing profusely. 


I quickly started to take over her body, however she felt me inside of her actively taking over, and of course she started resisting like crazy. Honestly, I thought I was just going to fail again, because she resisted so strongly. However, I mustered up all the effort and determination I had, and I fought like crazy, and after 10 grueling minutes, I was able to get her to back down for just a second, and I quickly took my opportunity and took complete control of her body, and I passed out! A couple minutes later, I woke up on the gym floor in my new body, in totally shock! I was just happy I was alive again! Anyways, if you want to talk more about what I went through, or have more questions, message me!
