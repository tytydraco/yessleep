The story begins on an ordinary evening. Suddenly, the doorbell rings. I open the door and see a stranger standing there. He looks friendly, with a faint smile on his lips, holding a bouquet of what appears to be carefully selected flowers.

"Hello, I'm your new neighbor," he says politely, his tone light and relaxed. The words sound strangely familiar, but I can't place why, so I brush it off.

"Hello," I reply curtly, a slight hint of caution creeping into my voice. He doesn't offer much detail, only mentioning that he recently moved nearby and wanted to get to know his neighbors. I nod, stepping aside slightly, indicating that he could come in for a chat.

As he walks into the living room, his eyes sweep over every corner of the room, eventually pausing on a framed photo resting on the coffee table. It's a picture of my daughter and me. He smiles thoughtfully, "Is this your daughter?"

"Yes," I reply, adjusting the frame slightly so it faces me. "She's currently attending Morning Light Elementary."

"What a coincidence, I teach there," he says, his smile seemingly natural, as if this were just an innocent stroke of fate. I keep my suspicions to myself but don't let my guard down.

He begins chatting about moving and adjusting to the new neighborhood, his tone calm and reassuring. As we sit down, he seems particularly interested in the house. "This place looks like it has some history. It must have many stories."

I hesitate slightly, but manage a polite smile before offering a brief explanation of the house's background. He listens intently, nodding at each detail, an odd focus in his gaze as though committing every word I say to memory.

Halfway through our tea, his questions begin to grow more specific. "This lamp is quite interesting. Did you pick it out yourself?"

"No, my daughter did. She likes the warm light," I answer. Before I realize it, he’s guided the conversation into many details about the house and our lives here.

He has a knack for listening, always finding the right questions to keep me talking. By the time he finally leaves, I realize that I've shared far too much with this stranger I barely know. Once the door closes behind him, the living room feels strangely empty, and a vague sense of unease settles in—but I can't quite put my finger on why.

A few days later, I receive an urgent message from work—a situation that demands my immediate attention, making it impossible for me to take my daughter to school. Despite my prior uneasy feeling about the neighbor, the urgency leaves me with no choice. I recall that he mentioned he works at Morning Light Elementary and might be able to help. So I decide to go to the address he had given me.

It’s a bright morning as I drive to the corner and find the blue house he had described. The door is half open, which strikes me as odd. Feeling increasingly uneasy, I step up and knock on the door.

A complete stranger answers, his face filled with confusion. "Who are you looking for?"

I hastily describe the neighbor, but the man shakes his head, telling me that he has lived there for years and has never heard of anyone moving in.

A chill runs down my spine. I quickly take out my phone and dial the number he had given me, but no one picks up. Each ring seems to heighten my anxiety.

The police arrive shortly after and verify everything with the homeowner. They inform me that the house has had the same owner for many years, and there has never been any record of anyone like the man I described.

As the sound of sirens fades away, I stand in front of the blue house, filled with an indescribable fear. My mind keeps replaying the scene—him standing in my living room, looking at my house, my family, with that strange familiarity mixed with unease and something sinister.

I pull out my phone again, my hand trembling as I dial his number one last time. The familiar, empty ringing fills my ear, and eventually stops abruptly.
