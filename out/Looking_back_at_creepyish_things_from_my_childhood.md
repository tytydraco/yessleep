I think I may have been haunted as a kid. Either haunted, possessed, or something else spooky like that. I’m not sure how much of this all is paranormal or freaky in that way, but I figured you here on r/nosleep would appreciate the stories and maybe even help me figure out what was going on. I’ll let you guys decide what you want to think of these stories.

Story 1 - Hide and Seek


There were tons of great places to play hide and seek in the house I grew up in. The neighborhood on Lincoln street was kind of old, so there were lots of old sheds and ditches, plenty of tarps to hide under, and the layouts of the houses worked really well with the game. Also, my older brother (let’s say his name is Jerry) and I had tons of opportunities to practice getting better at hide and seek. And I was the absolute best (recently discovered on r/autism that that may not have been a good thing but that’s not the point). But besides great hiding spots and lots of practice, there were a few particular things that made me so good. 

1) I could get myself to fit anywhere. Tight squeezes, cramped crawlspaces, under ottomans and in boxes – you name it, I could probably do it.
2) I could control my breath and heartbeat. Getting my heart to calm down from the thrill of my favorite game made it so that I could be calm enough to stay quiet no matter what. I was also (very proud of this) never given away with visible breath under blankets or anything like that. I learned a technique from my old babysitter that made it look like I wasn’t breathing at all. 
3) I could move between hiding places without being spotted. The best way to evade capture if the seeker was thorough was to hide in a place they had previously looked. I could move between spaces silently, hide in broad daylight, and even move between hallways without being spotted by anyone – playing or not.

For you horror freaks (/affectionate), this is how my obsession with hide and seek could have killed a kid.

It was just another game. Another Tuesday. The preschool kids my mom taught on the weekdays were on a break, so we had to include them in our game. In total, it was me, Jerry, two neighbor boys around our age, and three other kids that were a few years younger than us. We tried to protest, saying that our games took way longer than the amount of break time the kids had, but the decision was final. We didn’t love that, especially since it happened so often, and all but one of them were too easy to find. The one that was on our level, let’s call him Ace, lived in the house behind ours. It was an old neighborhood and the fences between houses were kind of lame and easy to climb, so Ace was pretty much one of us. I had previously taken him under my wing so that he could also become a professional like me. It seems like I’m rambling, sorry. All I’m trying to say is this kid had potential. 

The game started out normal. The older neighbor kid, Mark, stood in the corner of mine and Jerry’s room (where we usually played) and covered his eyes. We wanted to make one of the preschool kids be the seeker, but we didn’t know if they could count to 50 yet. 

I decided to mess with Mark and hide in the same room he was in. I figured Ace probably had a good plan to mess with him, too, so I gave him a thumbs up when Mark started counting. Timing my footsteps with each number, I quickly and soundlessly crept up into the closet behind him. All the other kids left the room at that time. With practiced hands, I silently crawled up behind a box of sentimental awards of mine and Jerry’s, up on the top right corner of the closet. Even if he turned on the light, he would have to move the box to see me. 

I’m guessing that the other two preschoolers just stood huddled together, giggling excitedly in the hallway, happy to be included. I had played this game enough to predict where everyone else might have hidden. The other neighbor brother, Luke, probably went behind the curtains in the spare bedroom. Jerry was likely harder to find, somewhere in the garage pantry. I was looking forward to see where they’d eventually find Ace, though. 

I was long-since settled in my hiding spot when Mark finally reached 50. The closet was the first place he checked. And man, it took everything in me not to laugh and give away my position right then and there. He was so close. I could see him squinting in my general direction. Almost feel the draft of air from the shirts he pushed aside, thinking he could catch someone behind them. But as usual, he left without suspecting that anyone was there. 

The rest of the game played out as it always did for a bit longer. The younger kids were immediately found, and I heard their squeals of joy when they realized they had been gotten. A few more minutes went by. Luke was discovered someplace on the other end of the house, I think. 

The game had only gone on for a little while (probably 30 minutes or so but I wasn’t counting) when I heard Mark and the others calling for Ace. I don’t think they got Jerry that time, but I heard Jerry’s voice too. Actually, even my mom was calling for him. If the adults were seeking too, that made me nervous. There was a sense of something bigger than a game that, even as a kid, I could pick up on. So I forfeited my perfect hiding spot to look with them. 

I looked in places that I taught him were better to hide in. The linen closet, the pantry in the garage, behind the curtains in my dad’s office – I looked everywhere. We couldn’t find him.

Luke suggested that we turn on the TV to lure him out. At the mentioning of TV, I remembered a chilling line from a kids’ show I saw one time when they would air clips of characters telling audiences safety tips.

No one thinks to look in the places you *don’t* want to find a child. 

With a heavy feeling in my gut, I rushed to check one last place. I yanked the door open and saw him laying on his side, looking up at me with only his eyes. He was completely still and his lips were blue, eyes red from crying that went unheard. 

Ace got himself stuck in the pull-out freezer. 

***TO BE CLEAR!!! I DID NOT TELL HIM TO GO THERE!!!***

Staring at the sight before me, the blood drained from my face at the realization. I didn’t understand hypothermia all that well (except for what I saw on an antarctic documentary one time), but I knew that no shivering meant something was very wrong. We couldn’t afford to waste time, so I got right to it. 

I worked quickly, but a nagging thought ate at me from the inside. The real world has consequences. People can get really hurt in ways you don’t expect. And sometimes it’s kind of your fault. If only I wouldn’t have been so insistent on playing the game. If only hide and seek wasn’t such an obsession of mine. If only I would have told him.

When I pulled Ace’s tiny body out of the freezer, he winced in pain. I thought his joints must have been stiff from being in such a cold place in that awkward position, so I offered for him to lean on me. To my surprise, there was an unwrapped popsicle stuck to his neck (he thought about eating a popsicle… while hiding in a freezer. Bro was trying to speedrun hypothermia). Pieces of ice that had come loose from ice trays were fused to his cheek and temple. I felt another pang of guilt. It must have been his tears that froze the things to him. Without thinking, I tried to swat the ice away from his face and it tore about a square centimeter of skin off his cheek, right next to his eye. Stupid mistake. I can’t remember if I screamed first or if he did. 

Whoever it was, it alerted the adults and everyone in the vicinity. Once he started shivering again, his tears returned and he sobbed for what felt like hours. Luke was the closest to his age so the two sat together while my mom and I tried to calm Ace. 

When things calmed down, he told my mom that someone told him about a cool (pun not intended) place to hide, helped him in there, and shut the door on him. That was odd. Because I know for a fact that 1) I wasn’t the one who helped Ace into the freezer, 2) none of the adults would have helped him in there, and 3) he couldn’t have closed it in on himself.

But naturally, being The Professional Hider in the neighborhood, it was automatically assumed that I was the one who did it. Despite my pleading to be heard out, I was heavily scolded and grounded for a month. Ace wasn’t allowed to play at our house anymore. Thank goodness preschool isn’t mandatory schooling – I don’t think he continued that either. 

I promise it wasn’t me that put him in there. It still makes me sick to think of what could have happened if I didn’t think to check the freezer sooner.

While that’s not explicitly paranormal, it still kind of haunts me. Someone else helped him into that freezer and closed him in. I don’t know how much I believe in ghosts or anything, but I don’t have any reason to think Ace lied that day. 

What do you guys think? Any theories?
