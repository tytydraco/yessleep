I need to talk about my sister’s roommates before I go completely insane.

A few days ago, my older sister (28) stopped returning my texts and calls. 

As the youngest sibling at twenty five, I felt weirdly responsible, so I decided to check on her. 

Rosie has always been stubborn, so ghosting me instead of explaining what was going on was pretty in character for her.

Still, nearly a week had gone by without a word from her—not even a mediocre TikTok, which *screamed* millennial. 

I hadn’t had a chance to visit her new place yet. 

Life got in the way, and I was struggling with some pretty intense depressive episodes when she had her housewarming party.

Mom spent three hours freaking out over her gift to Rosie—an exotic plant she’d bought online. She wanted it to be the perfect gift, but apparently, the other attendees showered my sister in expensive silverware and paperweights. 

Still, Rosie is obsessed with plants, so it was the perfect housewarming gift. 

I didn't realize the severity of my sister’s infatuation until I was standing on her doorstep, face-to-face with an overgrown lily, its leaves spiking me in the forehead.

There was no flower garden—the house was too small. Instead, someone had planted flowers between the cracks in the concrete path leading to the door. I almost felt bad for stepping on them. 

But when I reached the door, I noticed vines creeping through the frame and snaking up the walls. I knocked, swallowing my nerves. 

Rosie had three roommates, all of whom were college friends I had never met. 

I had, however, heard enough about them to feel like I knew them better than they knew themselves. 

Ever since we were kids, Rosie had attached herself to various obsessions, becoming hyper-fixated with TV shows, actors, singers, plants, and now, her friends. 

Every time she came for dinner, it was never about how she was or her life. 

Rosie talked about her friends with a sparkle in her eye, her smile broadening every time she mentioned them—which made me wonder if the four of them were, in fact, *more* than just friends.

When the door swung open, I was hit in the face with an overpowering scent—too strong, too intoxicating. 

It bled into my nostrils, clinging to the back of my throat, almost choking me. 

Somehow, though, it pulled me in, teasing me to take a deep inhale, allowing each aroma to fill my lungs, suffocating me further. The guy who peeked through the narrow gap looked closer to my age—mid-twenties.

His sandy-colored hair was a shoddy mess, as if he'd run his fingers through it too many times, with noticeably greasy, wayward strands entangled with—*daisies*?

I found myself entranced by each individual flower sitting comfortably on the crown of his head. His smile was crooked and knowing, one eyebrow raised, almost like he was expecting me. 

I thought my sister was exaggerating when she described him as having "plant boy energy," but I had to agree—though not for the reasons you might think. 

Yes, he was wearing a flower crown, and I was starting to think this was where my sister’s infatuation had stemmed from, but this guy was filthy. 

His short-sleeved tee was no longer white, no longer any color at all—just a smear of dirt ingrained in the fabric, clinging to his visibly clammy skin.

I don’t think he had showered in weeks—maybe even months. When he swatted a fly buzzing around his head, I found myself staring at his feet. 

He was barefoot, dirt caked between his toenails. He looked almost high, his pupils visibly dilated as he swayed back and forth, swinging on the door. 

High on that *smell*, maybe?

High enough to forget basic hygiene? 

I found my voice, my own hands growing slick with sweat.

“Hi,” I said, trying not to stare at his feet. “I'm—”

“Posie.”

The guy's smile widened, his voice smooth, almost melodic, which only strengthened my theory that my sister and her roommates were unknowingly getting high off that smell. 

I didn’t think he’d know me by my childhood nickname, yet he cocked his head slowly, as if I were a puzzle he was struggling to solve. I can't fully explain it, but this man did not like me. 

His smile was friendly enough, but it felt patronizing, as though he were being forced to talk to me. 

He was giving off high school mean-girl vibes, his lips pricking into a smile, his eyes raking me up and down like he wasn't covered in dirt. 

He was laughing at me, squeezing his lips together to try and hide it, and painfully failing. “You're Rosie’s older sister.”

“Poppy,” I corrected him.

His smile didn't waver. “Interesting choice of name.”

“I didn't choose it,” I quipped back. “Can I talk to my sister?”

He shrugged. “She's not available right now.”

I nodded patiently, though this guy was slowly getting on my nerves. His gaze never faltered, like he was drinking all of me in with just a single glance. “Can I come in?”

“It's Noah.”

“I didn't ask.”

His lips curved into a smirk. “It's common courtesy.”

“Can I just see my sister?” I swallowed a yell. “Please?”

He rolled his eyes, exaggerating a sigh. “Urgh, but then I'd have to climb up the stairs.”

I could sense my smile thinning. “You're in your mid-twenties.”

He shrugged. “Exactly. Halfway to thirty.”

“Can I see my sister?”

“She's tied up with something.”

“Okay, then, can I come in and see her myself?”

His smile didn't waver. “We have a lot of  plants.” 

“I know.”

“You miiiiiight get overwhelmed.”

“I'm fine.” I said. “I can deal with a few flowers.”

Something in his expression twitched suddenly, the quirk of a genuine smile. Whatever face he was wearing on top of his *face* began to splinter, making way to the boy underneath, who's expression  brightened at the mere mention of flowers. 

“Do you… like flowers?”

When I didn't respond, he straightened up, mockingly bowing and gesturing me through. 

“Come on in! But don't say I didn't warn ya.” He winked, settling me with that *infuriating* smile. 

When I hesitated, he danced back inside, and down the hallway. I followed, transfixed by the amount of plants. 

When the door slammed shut behind me, I jumped, but Noah just laughed, commenting about a faulty hinge. 

I could sense his gaze following me, immediately triumphant. 

He was *right*. I was immediately overwhelmed by the sheer amount of *green* in my face, leaves tangling with my hair and prickling my bare arms. 

When I had to push through overgrown leaves to follow Noah, tripping over flowering buds growing through cracks in flooring, I knew my sister and her equally insane roommate were at the point of no return. 

This house was more suited to plants than humans. 

I took slow steps, drinking in every flower, every mini tree, mushroom—everything that she could grow, she had.

My sister had turned their hallway into a mini rainforest. I caught a spider scuttling across my arm and brushed it off. 

The further I delved into the house, the more obvious it became that my sister’s plant obsession was going a little too far. 

Noah, unfazed by the dirt caked into the carpet and spider webs clinging to every wall, coaxed me into what I guessed was a kitchen. But there was far too much green—entangled vines and leaves hanging from the ceiling and sticking from the walls—to prepare food. 

There was a refrigerator and an oven, but like everything else, they were caked in dirt. 

I was half aware that I was standing under a giant sunflower growing from the ceiling. Under my feet, what was left of kitchen tiles had been removed to fill with fresh soil. Noah gave me a small tour, and somehow it got worse. 

The upstairs was out of bounds, apparently, but I did see the stairs, and that was enough. Whatever was growing on the floor was spreading, tangled through every piece of furniture, every splash of paintwork, and eventually, had found the ceiling, spider webbing into the kitchen and beyond. 

Noah was a fairly decent tour guide, though he did stop at every single fucking plant, perfectly naming it and telling me of its origins. 

He led me into a lounge area that was again suffocated by plants. 

I was pretty sure these kids had planted grass inside their living room to accommodate a variety of strangely colored flowers blooming from every corner. There was a semblance of a living space, with a shabby couch in front of a television screen gathering dust. 

I glimpsed a girl in yellow knelt in front of the window, bathing in the rich afternoon sunlight, her head tipped back, eyes closed, dark brown curls tangled with roses flowing down the curve of her spine.

The bright yellow was her dress, a discolored curtain sculpted to an almost skeletal figure. 

She was beautiful, and yet her beauty didn't slide into the usual standards. 

When she slightly turned her head, presumably to drink in the sunlight, letting it caress every inch of her face, I noticed her angular nose and crooked teeth. Somehow, though, she fit perfectly inside this room as one of the flowers. 

Looking closer, something twisted in my gut. 

She was in the same state as Noah. Her hair was in a matted, entangled disarray.

I could tell she hadn't showered in a while, stewing in the exact same dress, which almost framed her, bleeding into her, binding itself to her skin. 

“Noah.” Her voice was a sigh, and I detected the soft cadence of a British accent. The girl’s eyes flickered, her lips pricking into a smile. She shook her head, enjoying streaks of sunlight pricking her cheeks. This girl was drinking it in greedily, giggling to herself. 

“Darling, didn't I tell you to stop picking up strays?” I noticed several flies buzzing around her, creeping across her face and slipping through her lips, but she wasn't fazed, her smile only growing wider.

Noah, who was leaning against the wall, his arms folded, rolled his eyes. “That's Violet. Commonly here, getting her daily fix,” he shot me a smile, that again, was real. I think being around flowers made this guy happy. He looked like he was glowing, bleeding in the late afternoon rays carving a shadow across his face. 

“It's a house tradition that we gather here every morning and soak up the early sunrise.”

I didn't know what to say, except, “Cool.”

I think the two were expecting me to join them– especially when Noah stepped toward, closer to the window, and into direct sunlight.

I watched the way his head tipped back, slowly, eyes closing, like he was revelling in it, letting it drown him, bleeding into his bones. 

I could see every inhale, and each one looked and sounded peaceful, like every breath was being gently pulled from his lungs. 

I don't know why, but part of me wanted to join in with whatever this was. 

It made them happy. It calmed them, dragging them from the mundanity of their lives, and into the light. 

I found myself smiling, my gaze enraptured by the two roommates just vibing, before I caught myself. 

These two were *filthy*. 

Their house was a health hazard, and I was pretty sure they were high on a combination of dizzying sunlight, and a constant stream of smells choking both logical thought, and burning enough brain cells to stop them acting like actual people.

I think I was falling for it too, already intoxicated by the stink. 

But my body, however, knew something was wrong, a slither of panic entwining its way through me, hitting every nerve ending. 

“Noah.” I found my voice when he led me outside. 

“Mm?” He proudly showed me his favorite, a purplish rose he cupped in his hands. 

I didn't have the heart to say, “This is fucking weird.” 

Rosie’s roommates had a greenhouse in their tiny backyard. 

It wasn't surprising, but their whole *house* was a greenhouse. 

Suddenly, my sister was an afterthought, when Noah led me through copious amounts of the exact same plant. 

He was comfortable in the dirt, his feet squishing through soil, as he danced from plant to plant, watering each one with the perfect precision like they were his own children. 

When Noah was finished tending to each stem, he picked up the hose and sprayed himself, gulping directly from the nozzle. 

Noah tossed me the hose still sputtering water. 

“Want some?” he swiped his mouth, “It's fresh!”

This kid was in love with flowers, in love with his lifestyle, and doing so, he had somehow forgotten that *he* was human. 

Rosie was fucking insane for living in these conditions, and I was getting her out. 

“Where's your bathroom?” I asked, feigning a smile. I was already backing away. 

Noah didn't seem to notice, knelt in front of a patch of dirt. He was using his hands to dig a fresh hole for what I guessed was a new plant. I watched his fingers rake through the dirt, something slimy slithering its way up my throat. 

“Bathroom is upstairs on your left,” he responded in a low hum. I didn't wait for him to confirm which door or room, I was already stumbling back into the house. 

Violet was still sunbathing when I peeked inside the lounge. But this time, she had taken off her shirt, and I swore something was *growing* from her left breast. 

I could see it tangled around her, creeping down towards her stomach. 

I was already running up the stairs, my sister’s name choked in the back of my throat. “Rosie?”

I clawed for my phone, and it slipped through my trembling hands. 

“Rosie!”

Taking slow strides down the hallway, I found myself pushing through tangled vines and flowers physically blocking the bathroom door. 

There were six rooms on the second floor, two of which were completely blocked, suffocated by greenery. 

When I managed to shove the bathroom door open, I stepped straight into branches whipping my face and tearing at my hair. The bathroom, surprisingly, was the most normal room in the house. 

Apart from the large flowering buds—almost the size of me—crawling up and down the tiles, I could still see a bathtub and toilet, both of which were filled with dirt. I had no doubt they were being used as makeshift plant pots.

Something moved on the wall—one of the pink flower buds twitched.

I started forward, tripping over tangled vines poking from the bathroom floor.

No.

*Not* vines. 

Something inside me snapped, coming apart, and I felt myself straighten up, my hand slowly creeping toward my mouth. 

I knew what it was before it fully registered, my body well ahead of my brain. I was half-aware of a scream clawing in my throat, my palm suffocating my mouth. 

The body at my feet was wrapped in a silk-like lining, almost like a cocoon. 

But I could just make out thick, sandy hair sprouting from a decomposing skull, his legs curled into him, almost resembling a fetus. 

I dropped to my knees beside him, his name muffled against my palm. *Noah.*

I wanted to believe he was alive, wanted to believe he was okay, but when I made the mistake of rolling him onto his back, I immediately threw up, choking on vomit trying to squeeze its way up my throat. 

Noah was a psychopath’s depiction of beauty. His eyes had been plucked out, twin dandelions in their place, skeletal teeth tangled in vines, as if someone had spent hours—days, even—transforming his corpse into their masterpiece. 

His organs had been carved out perfectly, as if by a surgeon’s hand, and each one was replaced by blooming flowers. 

Noah’s heart—or what was left of it—was a beautiful, blooming rose, while its stem entwined through his rib cage, flowering all the way down to the gouge where his intestines should have been.

The worst part was, even without eyes or a soul, somehow, this boy was still smiling.

When I tried to kick him onto his front as a mark of respect, I realized his body—his whole being—was cruelly bound to the tiles.

My only thought then was to get out of there.

Because if my sister’s roommate was dead in front of me, who the fuck let me inside their house?

I was pulling the door open, my body running on adrenaline, when the twitching and expanding bud on the wall moved again. This time I stumbled forward, glimpsing a human face sprouting through writhing petals. 

Two human faces. 

The first was a guy, who I guessed was the third unnamed roommate. 

The flowering bud tried to spit him out, but he was undigested flesh, cocooned in a sticky white substance. 

This guy was my age, dark brown hair, and traces of laugh lines, stabling him as the joker of the group. I thought he was mostly intact, just unconscious, until my gaze traveled down, finding his hollowed-out stomach, which, just like Noah’s, was filled with blooming flowers.

The second human face came through quickly, slick with that same white substance. 

The thing that was holding her, holding the unnamed boy, was alive, twitching and swaying side to side, almost like it was fucking teasing me, challenging me to pull my sister’s mutilated corpse free. 

I already knew her dark blonde curls tied into that stupid ponytail, the butterfly tattoo on her cheek she got only last year.

Rosie.

My sister’s eyes were closed, tiny pink flowers wrapped around her pupils. I didn’t want to look, but I couldn’t stop. 

I already knew she was fucking dead—her cheeks were grey and drained of color, a vicious, merciless green tinge creeping across her face and tangled in her blood. I could see where it had spread, like a virus, stretching up her neck and sprouting across her face.

But somehow, my eyes defied me, dropping down.

To her bulging, pregnant stomach, which, unlike her, was still alive.

Something drove me forward, and when it sensed movement, entwined green vines wrapped around my sister’s stomach, as if protecting whatever was inside.

But my sister couldn’t get pregnant. When she was younger, Rosie had severe period pain to the point of ending up in the emergency room. 

She had her womb removed, so she could never have children. 

I found myself transfixed by the writhing thing stretching my sister’s stomach. 

So, how was Rosie *pregnant*?

My gaze flicked to the unnamed roommate, and then Noah.

Both of them had been hollowed out and filled with flowers.

Which meant my sister wasn’t *its* only attempt.

This thing just needed a *body*, and Rosie was its success. 

I had to guess the the bodies were “impregnated” by the spores. 

In one swift movement, I was at the door, my hands clamped around the handle.

“Posie?”

Noah’s voice sent me twisting around, my heart in my throat.

Whatever this thing was, it was perfectly mimicking the dead boy—a dead boy I had never really known. When he cocked his head, a single pink flower bloomed from his right eye, taking it over. 

His skin moved, writhing, like something was there, tangled in every mimicked bone. I could see this thing coming alive, not just inside Noah, but all around us, in rustling leaves, in the buds holding my sister and the unnamed roommate. 

It sounded like they were laughing. When Noah opened his mouth, blood-stained petals slipped through his lips, and I broke apart, both in body and mind. 

I threw myself past him, and when he grabbed for me, his slimy, inhuman fingers wrapping around me, I slammed his fucking head into the floor.

Once.

He screeched like an animal.

Twice, and blood-stained slime erupted from his mouth and nose.

An inhuman cry rattled from not just his mouth but all around us.

Violet’s scream fell in symphony downstairs.

The thing holding my sister echoed its cry, and Rosie dropped onto the floor. 

A sudden, harmonious wail slammed into me, so powerful I had to bury my head in my knees. Noah dropped to his knees, conscious, but in visible pain. There was a brief moment when his hands came up, clawing at the greenery sprouting from his skull, before they fell limp.

I hate that I didn’t drag Rosie out with me.

But she was dead—and I couldn’t do that to myself. I didn’t stop, didn’t falter, forcing myself to keep running until I was halfway down the street, screaming into my hands.

I went home, and for the next few days, I stayed silent.

I showered, scrubbing myself until my skin was raw, until my thoughts were hazy.

Two days ago, I stood in front of my bedroom mirror, pulling half of a tangled rose from my spine, where the thorns pricked through my skin. I went to the bathroom at work and found myself staring at tiny buds growing on my breast.

I broke and told Mom. I told her everything, showing her what was growing on me.

I plucked each tangled root from my fingernail, dropping them in front of her.

“Rosie is dead,” I shrieked, my voice trembling.

Mom didn’t speak for a moment, her fingers nursing her coffee.

Then she reached across the table and pulled out a petal clinging to my hair.

“That young man was… a bad influence,” she finally said. “When I first visited them, these children were adults, and yet they made stupid decisions.” 

Mom sighed, sipping her coffee. “Noah and your sister argued a lot, while the other two?” She scoffed. “Violet, a former pregnant teenager, and Nate, who went to Juvie.”

Mom’s smile grew whimsical, playing with my hair.

“There are good things growing in that house,” Mom said. “Good *people*, Posie.”

I left before she could finish her sentence, grabbing my bag and getting out of there. I can still hear her words in my head, and even here, where I know she won’t find me, I can feel her eyes boring into me. I’m so fucking scared she’s coming to get me.

I can still see her.

Staring, almost longingly, at the flowers growing from my skin.

Waiting.

“Besides,” my mother’s voice was a chuckle, and I swore I could see tiny pricks of green tangled under her fingernails. 

“I’m going to be a grandma.”

… 

Edit: my Mom is hunting me down. She wants me to be part of that house, with my sister and whatever the fuck her roommates are. I'm so fucking scared. 

I have roots growing from my scalp. 

I have buds stuck under my skin, and they're driving me fucking crazy. 

I think it was in the air. 

Inside that house, whatever *this* is was in the air. 

I was infected before stepping into their kitchen.

Its in my sister. 

In his roommates. Noah, Violet, and Nate. 

And my mother. 

Am I turning into one of *them*?  

Please *help* me.
