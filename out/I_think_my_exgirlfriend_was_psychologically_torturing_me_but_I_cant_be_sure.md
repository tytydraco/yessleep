I’m pretty sure I’ve just broken up with my girlfriend of eight years and need some advice on whether or not I did the right thing. I’ve tried talking to my friends and family about what’s been happening over the last month but every time I open my mouth I struggle to work out what to say or how to begin. They all know Sam and if I told them how she’s been behaving I’m not sure they’d believe me. They’d probably just tell me that “it’s all in my head” and maybe it is, but right now that feels irrelevant. I’m just glad it’s over.

Before I get into the story proper I want to talk about my relationship with Sam a little bit. Most couples, especially young ones, don’t make it to their eighth anniversary and if they do they’re often drifting apart. This wasn’t the case with me and Sam. At least not from my perspective. I still loved her and it seemed as if she still loved me. We spent all of our time together, we made each other laugh, we had sex on a regular basis, we were even talking about having kids. That’s what made her behaviour so shocking. I didn’t see it coming at all. 

The first time it happened we were in bed. We’d both had a long day and were pretty tired so after a quick dinner we dragged ourselves upstairs. She went through her usual nighttime routine – washing her face, moisturising, applying various creams and lotions that I can never remember the name of, and then she read for a bit. She only managed about five pages before her head started to nod. I remember taking the book from her hands, kissing her on the forehead and reaching for the light. 

And it was then, as I turned, that I heard it – a raspy whisper. At first I thought Sam had said the name ‘Elizabeth’ so I asked, “What was that?” but she just replied, “Hmm” or something similar. She was on her side, facing away from me and sounded almost drunk with tiredness. “Don’t worry,” I said, turning off the light.

To be honest, I didn’t think that much of it that first time. I wasn’t even sure she’d made the sound. I told myself it was a noise from outside, or maybe something to do with the plumbing. That’s what I was thinking as I closed my eyes and it was only when I was nodding off, that it occurred to me that the noise sounded less like the name ‘Elizabeth’ and more like two words - ‘Little bitch’. But at that point, I was past caring and seconds later I was asleep. 

I didn’t think about it the next morning. We both got up and showered, made breakfast together and then headed to our separate offices. I had back-to-back calls all morning so I didn’t have time to think about anything but marketing budgets until lunch. When I came downstairs, Sam had prepared a caprese salad. It was a nice day so we ate outside in our tiny garden. She bitched about her clients and we talked about maybe visiting her mother at the weekend, as she was ill. Everything was normal and when I got back to my desk I whiled away the afternoon, halfheartedly reviewing ads for our next campaign. At four, I clocked off early and went down to the living room. Sam usually worked until 5:30 or 6 so I thought I’d watch Netflix while I waited. Her office is next to the living room so I tend to turn the volume down while she's working. Anyway, I chose a show – Chef’s Table I think it was – and zoned out watching some American guy make pizza dough. I was just about to start the second episode when I heard a noise. Right away, I was transported to the previous evening. It was the same raspy whispering, maybe a little louder this time, and instead of one word, it sounded like a whole conversation. It was coming from her office. 

I turned the TV off and the whispering seemed to grow louder. I couldn’t hear any actual words, just a crackly hum. 

I called her name but she didn’t reply. So I got up and walked towards her office. She didn’t look around when I entered. The room was silent.

I don’t remember exactly what we said but it was something like:

Me: Hey

Sam: “Whatsup?” 

She didn’t turn around, I remember that. Just kept looking at her screen.

Me: “Did you say something?”

Sam: “Nope.”

Me: “Weird, I thought I heard something, like whispering.”

Sam: “Whispering?”



Me: “Yes, were you watching something?”



Sam: “Nope. Maybe it came from downstairs?”



Me: “Maybe.”



She turned around then and smiled. 



“I’ll only be another 20,” she said.



“Ok.”



Moments later I was back on the couch and when Sam joined me, the rest of the evening was normal. We had dinner, watched TV, went to bed and when I reached for the light, there was no weird noise. Even so, I lay awake for at least an hour. I was certain that the whispering had come from Sam’s office, which made me think she’d definitely said something when we were in bed the night before. My first thought (and don’t judge me for this) was that there was something wrong with her. She’d been under a lot of pressure at work and maybe this was some reaction to stress? I decided that if it happened a third time I would bring it up with her.



I didn’t have to wait long.



The following day she went into the office and then went for drinks after work. My day was uneventful although the house felt oddly creepy given what had happened over the previous two days. Sam came home around 12. I feigned sleep when she came in and she didn’t wake me. I could tell from the way she was moving and taking off her clothes that she was pretty drunk and I expected her to do what she usually did: fall asleep in sub zero seconds and then maybe snore for a bit. But she didn’t. When she got into bed she went silent. Minutes passed. Normally, this would have put me at ease – no snoring tonight! – but that night it seemed ominous. Even so, after about half an hour, I started to drift off. 



I was on the brink of unconsciousness when I heard it. Two words, whispered directly in my ear, so close I could feel her breath on my cheek. Little Bitch. I scrambled for the lamp and almost fell out of bed. Eventually, I hooked the switch and the light flickered on. I turned to look at Sam. She was facing away from me and appeared to be asleep.



“Sam?” I said.



No reply.



I repeated her name, louder this time. Then a third time. I shook her shoulder, hard.



“What?” she said. She sounded groggy but I could tell she was angry.



“What was that?” I said.



She rolled over.



“What was what?”



“You just whispered in my ear.”



“No I didn't.”



“You did.”



“Mark, I was asleep.”



I think that was the first time I considered there may be something wrong with me.



“I heard something,” I said.



“Sure you weren’t dreaming?”



“No,” I said. “I mean, yes. Yes I’m sure I wasn’t dreaming.”



“Well I didn’t say anything.”



She rolled over again.



I weighed my options. 



“Ok, sorry,” I said eventually. She didn’t reply.



I rolled onto my back and looked at the ceiling. There were two possibilities. Either, one of us was losing our mind or she was lying. And if she was lying she was either messing with me or tormenting me. The former seemed unlikely. Sam didn’t go in for practical jokes. 



So she was tormenting me. The question was why?



There was only one reason that I could think of.



Almost a year before all of this started, I had cheated on Sam. It was a stupid, cliché of a situation. I’d gone for after-work drinks with some colleagues and after countless pints I had ended up kissing someone. I won’t say who as I don’t want to get them into trouble but it meant nothing and I wasn’t even the one who instigated it, if that makes any difference. You probably think I’m a horrible person but I meant everything I wrote earlier: I loved Sam, still do, and see the kiss as nothing more than a stupid, drunken, one-time thing. I wasn’t about to embark on some kind of affair.



Even so, I didn’t tell Sam about it. She has always had a zero-tolerance policy on infidelity and I was certain that if she found out she’d leave me. 



But what if she had found out and this odd behaviour was her way of punishing me? I barely remembered the kiss but I knew that it happened outside a pub in Covent Garden, not exactly discreet. One of my colleagues could have seen us or one of our friends maybe? Perhaps word had gotten back to her and instead of lashing out she decided to torture me instead.



It didn’t seem like something Sam would do but I knew how she felt about cheating. And to be honest, the alternative – impending madness – seemed more frightening.



The next morning we had breakfast together in the living room. This wasn’t unusual, we liked to carve out moments together away from our desks. She didn’t mention what had happened the night before and I didn’t bring it up. I’d decided I was going to tell her about the kiss but in the moment I bottled it. Instead, I said something like: 



“Hey, are we ok?”



She turned to me, still chewing her toast, and frowned slightly.



“What do you mean?” She said.



“Are you happy with me, with us?”



She took my hand.



“Where’s this come from?”



“I don’t know, I just feel a bit disconnected from you I guess.”



“I don’t think there’s anything wrong," she said. Her voice was gentle. “Do you?”



“No,” I said. “No, look I’m sorry. I love you.”



“I love you too,” she said, squeezing my hand.



I let out a heavy sigh. I hadn’t realised how much I needed to hear those words.



“I’m sorry, I think I’m just getting in my head. Probably spent too much time in the house this week.”



She smiled.



“Let’s go for a walk at lunch.”



And then she went back to her toast. 



At first I felt good, as if we’d cleared the air, but I quickly realised that nothing had changed. She didn’t know about the kiss. Or if she did she wasn’t willing to bring it up. Complete mental breakdown was still a possibility.



The following week passed without incident. There was no whispering between rooms, no late-night verbal abuse. I was still thinking about discussing the whispering with Sam but it seemed a bit silly now. And to be honest, I didn’t want to frighten her. I would tell her about the kiss but not right away, when the time was right.



I remember we got takeaway on that Friday night and watched Sharknado while getting drunk on homemade margaritas.



Two days later I left our flat and I haven’t been back since.



As with the other incidents, there was no build up to what happened on Saturday night. We’d spent the day in London, visiting a gallery and having some drinks with friends. We came home, had sex and then went to bed.



I was woken up around 2AM.



I heard the whispering again but it was different this time, more like a rhythmic chant: littlebitchlittlebitchlittlebitchlittlebitchlittlebitchlittlebitchlittlebitch. I immediately groped for the lamp and snapped it on. The voice fell silent. I turned to question Sam but to my surprise, she was gone. Her side of the bed was neatly folded down, which was odd as I’d seen her get under the covers. I called out her name but she didn’t reply. My first thought was that she was in the bathroom but the door to our ensuite was open and the room was dark.



“Sam,” I called again.



And then I saw her. Or rather I saw her eyes. 



Our bedroom opens out onto a small landing that leads to a staircase. That night, the bedroom door was open and from the glow of the lamp I could just about make out the bannisters and the shadowy stairwell. 



And there she was. She was peering between the bannisters. I don’t know how else to describe it. I could only see the top half of her head, from the nose up, but the light was catching her hair and reflecting off her eyes. She was staring at me between the wooden bars. No, not just staring, glaring. 



“Sam,” I said again, whispering this time. She didn’t reply.



I sat in bed for a while, I’m not sure how long. She didn’t move or look away. Just continued to stare. She didn’t blink. Her eyelids seemed to have disappeared completely.



I got up and stood beside the bed. Her eyes followed me but her head was perfectly still. I won’t lie, I was afraid. I took one step and then another, her eyes moving ever so slightly to cover my movements. I wanted to look away but I was mesmerised. It was like staring at a stranger. And although her eyes were wide and intense they were also dull and empty, like those of a drunk. 



“Sam”, I said again. 



I was standing in the doorframe now, about to step into the hall. I reached for the lightswitch but didn’t press it. I was truly terrified. Too scared to breathe. The switch felt like a trigger. When I pressed it she would start screaming, run at me, pull me down the stairs and smash my head against the steps.



But those eyes. She was still staring at me, unblinking, unmoving, turning the dial on my fear until I could barely move, hardly think.



I flicked the switch.



The naked bulb pinged into life and I squinted against the glare. I looked down at Sam and saw that she was blinking and holding a hand up to block the light. Then she looked down at her feet and through the bannisters towards our bed.



Her face was scrunched up, her eyes slits and her face puffy.



“What happened?” She said eventually.



“I don’t know,” I said.



“Was I sleepwalking?”



“I don’t know.”



Something about my voice must have betrayed my fear or my suspicion.



“Are you ok?” she said.



“Yeah, fine.”



She moved to touch me but I flinched away.



“What’s up?” she said. I could tell she was hurt and annoyed.



“You were whispering again.”



“What?”



Her face fell. And I saw something in her eyes – disbelief maybe, and something else – defensiveness.



“What was I saying?”



“It doesn’t matter,” I said.



“Mark, come on.” 



She was fully awake now and her eyes were bright.



“Look we’re tired, let’s go to sleep.”



She nodded but I could tell she was still upset.



“I’m going to sleep on the sofa.”



“Really?” she said.



I nodded and headed to the spare room for bedding. When I moved back to the landing she’d closed the door and the bedroom light was off.



I didn’t sleep the rest of that night and in the morning I told her everything. About the kiss and the two words she’d been saying over and over again. Naturally, she focused on the kiss and when I (stupidly) told her that it didn’t matter and that the whispering was more important she just became more angry. Eventually I offered to leave and she agreed that I should.



A week passed with no word. I wrote out a few messages – apologies and longer, more argumentative messages about the whispering – but I didn’t send any of them in the end. I kept thinking about the glaring, the whispering. Was that how she really felt about me? And if she hadn’t known about the kiss then why did she feel that way? What had I done wrong? It could have been a subconscious thing, or maybe it was senseless and random. But I realised it had affected me. I wasn’t ready to go back to her. I couldn’t face the idea of sharing a bed with her.



I eventually messaged her saying I needed to take some time. She thought that was a good idea. That was three weeks ago. She hasn’t been in touch since. I’m not sure if we’ve broken up or we’re on a break but I don’t see myself shaking this feeling anytime soon.



There are moments when I think I overreacted and maybe I should have been more sensitive. Maybe she is suffering some sort of episode and needs my support. But then I remember what it was like in that room when she was glaring at me, the tone of her voice when she whispered those two words in my ear.



Knowing that someone else has experienced something like this would be a great help. I’ve had a look online and can’t find anything. It wasn’t sleepwalking, not really, and I don’t think I’m losing my mind. Like I said, I do love Sam and still want to be with her but I need answers before I can move forward.
