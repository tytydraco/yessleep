I recently moved in with my boyfriend, Baz, of eleven months into an apartment. We live sort of off the outskirts of town, because we like how there’s more trees and open fields for us to walk in. Most importantly though, we moved in because he recently inherited this apartment complex from his late aunt.

Something’s been off though.

It started about a week after we moved in. We were making love when all of a sudden he starts calling me, my name is Rachel, by saying Cheryl. Knee deep in me he would start saying “Cheryl I’ve been so bad.”

The first time this happened. I got up from him and put my clothes on and stomped into the living room. He’s always confused when it happens, we follows me into the next room and asks me why I stopped. Every time. As if I didn’t hear him 1. Call me by a different woman’s name and 2. Act like I was some sort of mommy figure with the way he was calling himself a “bad boy”. I’ve never heard of Cheryl before and we’ve always have had a pretty tame sex life.

He grabbed my arm that night when I walked out of our bedroom into the kitchen, asking me to slow down. I spun on my heel and shouted, “Why the fuck did you call me Cheryl? Do you have some weird kinkish hang up on an old ex?” 

His temple furrowed, a deep line I had only seen him make when he was working on a puzzle or reading an IKEA instruction manual. “Baby what? I didn’t say that. I don’t even have an ex named Cheryl?”

“Then why the hell did I hear you call me Cheryl? Is this some weird dominatrix or online girlfriend you’re mixing me up with? Because you better have a fucking explanation for this or I swear to God I’m packing up and leaving right now. And if this is some weird invite to your weird kinks, just know I’m never going to call you a bad boy or try to spank you.”

He shook his head, and got down on his knees as he took my hands in his. His eyes looked up at me pleadingly. “Rach, I promise you, I never said that. I don’t have a Cheryl in my life nor have I ever wanted you to do ANY of that stuff to me.”

I sighed. I must have misheard him. I’ve been stressed with work, my promotion has made me work more hours to prove to my boss that I was deserving of it and I’ve taken it out on Baz. “I’m sorry baby. I think I’m just exhausted by all the hours at my job and the stress of moving into a new apartment. Can we just have normal sex now?”

He smiled, and we resumed. But after that, I felt like I kept hearing scraping. I jumped out of bed to make sure our bed frame wasn’t hurting the wall, but that wasn’t it. So I got back on top until we were done, trying my best not to listen to the horrible scraping noise.

That routine has happened every time we’ve had sex since. And we’ve had sex eleven times now after only being moved in for about two months. It’s driving me insane.

Baz and I both have demanding jobs with differing hours. Sometimes he’ll be home for hours before I come back, but rarely is that the case for me. One day, when I got back earlier from work, I started messing around in the apartment instead of starting dinner. I started going through my boxes and making sure I had organized everything the best I could do, when I opened the desk of drawers that Baz had brought and stared at the image looking up at me.

A letter, with nothing on its white face except a purple cursive C that branched out across the entire canvas.

I didn’t even want to open it. But I knew I had to. I had been avoiding sex with Baz because it kept leading to the same conversation and the same scraping noise. It was all beginning to become eerier to me, like I was living the same routine. But inside, I was going crazy, worry and delusions were eating my own mind I couldn’t help but wonder if I would ever get an answer.

With shaking hands, I picked it up. I slid my finger across the opening of the envelope, letting the letter slip out onto the floor.

As I stopped to pick it up, it was as if all of the air had left the room. Silence blanketed me, and the lamp that sat innocently on the chest of drawers began to flicker.

Heart pounding in my chest, I read the letter.

“You will be punished, naughty boy.”

As soon as my eyes had even scanned it, I heard a door click and turn. I screamed out, “Baz?” 

But there was no answer. It was not the front door, but another door inside of the house. The only one I hadn’t gone into, our storage room, as I knew all of the few doors in our apartment were open because I was home and didn’t care. 

I immediately packed a small getaway bag, and I’m not even going to text my boyfriend my whereabouts. This whole thing is freaking me the fuck out. I’m going to sleep at a friend’s house tonight. Do you think I should call the relationship off or should I go investigate? At worst, I’m scared that this “Cheryl” might be living in that closet for my boyfriend’s weird sexual activities, but I don’t even want to dare and step foot in it. At best though, maybe this is all a dream?
