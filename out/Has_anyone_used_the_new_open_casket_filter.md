Throwaway because my boyfriend's on reddit and I don't want to freak him out more than I already have but has anyone else used the open casket filter?

Like everyone during Hurricane Hilary, I was messing around on tiktok playing with the new filters until I stumbled upon this new one called open casket. It's right after bold, and basically the filter shows you laying in a casket as it gives you the exact date of when you will die. I made my boyfriend try it first and he looked fine, pretty much just like the aged filter with a date for 03/12/2067. But when I tried it, I literally threw my phone across the room.

Why? Because the filter gave me my date for this weekend. And it didn't show me as some peaceful old lady laid gracefully to rest -- it showed me as I am now, except there was a deep ridge that swallowed the middle of my face. And my jaw hung impossibly low, as if stretched by something unnatural. I don't remember everything because I don't want to remember everything.

I have a weird relationship with death. I lost some important people very young, so I tend to get sensitive about afterlife-y stuff, movies or tv shows about someone grieving is too much for me. I don't know why I tried it. Some part of me wishes it was fake and it probably is, but what if it isn't? What if it's someone's way of telling me I didn't grieve hard enough so I deserve this?

My boyfriend told me that some apps use predictive data, like the aged filter (which has proven to be accurate by multiple derms, depressingly), but he doesn't think anyone or anything can ultimately predict how we die. It's easy for him to say. He looked handsome dead.

I know it's stupid to freak out over a stupid filter but I really don't know what to do. We were supposed to drive up to Temecula this weekend for his parent's vow renewal but now I'm not so sure. Am I crazy to believe that this might actually be accurate? I haven't really seen anyone post about it, it's nowhere in my fyp like the bold filter was at its peak. No articles either. Is it only for iOS? But shouldn't everyone have the same filters? My boyfriend told me everyone should have it.

For those of you who want to try it for themselves, it's the solid black bubble in between bold and natural glow. You can't miss it, even though you should.

Edit: just used the filter on a photo of my grandma (she passed from covid in 2021). It gave me the exact date of when she died, including what she wore in her open casket. The lighting of the church was just as I remembered. It's hard to type now.

Edit: boyfriend found this post, talked me out of it. We decided to go up to his parents after all. I'll update if anything happens
