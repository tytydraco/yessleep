What an ignorant fuck I was, thinking the dead were just a nuisance, trying to distract me. All along they were trying to warn me about Kurt. And what did I do? Give them the middle finger. I was blinded by love; I mean who wouldn’t? I thought I had finally met the love of my life. I’ve been single for so long that I had lost trust in men, and when Kurt came along, I saw him as this knight in shining armor riding on a white horse to save me from a life of loneliness. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. Kurt wasn’t just any man—he was a monster, a cannibal, who had eaten over a dozen women over the years. And now, with this horrifying truth clawing at my mind, the only thought pounding in my head was to run as far away from him as possible. But first, I needed to get to the nearest police station to make a statement. I packed my belongings, along with shotguns and rifles, with my parents’ help. We planned to go into hiding for a few days, fearful of what Kurt might do once he found out I knew his secret. On the way to the station, my father, Todd, kept reminding me “*I told you so about Kurt”,* while my mom, Gina, stayed silent, eager to leave this entire mess behind us as quickly as possible.



I darted into the police station, while my parents remained in the car. Down the hall, I spotted two sergeants in conversation. I rushed up to them, desperate, and told them that I had information about a case involving middle-aged women being eaten. Their expressions shifted immediately, and without a word, they ushered me into a small, windowless room and shut the door behind us. The questions came hard and fast, probing into my connections into the case and revealing that over a dozen women had vanished under similar circumstances in the past year. I told them everything I knew about Kurt, including our plan to marry in three days. But then one of their questions made me stop cold.



“Did Kurt Monarch ever talk to you about any women he’d ever dated in the past, Martie?” I pulled back and raised my eyebrows. I never shared Kurt’s last name with the sergeants at any time, so how could they have known what his last name sounded like? 



“No, ma’am. I was in love with him and clearly couldn’t give a damn about his past conquests. I now know that was a mistake.” As the sergeants kept questioning me, three dead women appeared behind them, their vacant eyes locked onto mine. They seemed desperate to convey something, yet no sound passed their lips. I struggled to decipher their silent message, but finally, as I tried to read their lips, the meaning became clear. RUN. RUN. RUN. RUN. RUN.



And I did just that. 



I burst out of the room, weaving through the crowded hallway filled with deputies and racing down the steps of the police station. Outside, my mother had the car running, ready to go. We sped off just as officers poured out of the building. My parents fired questions at me, trying to understand why I was so terrified inside a police station.



“The dead told me to run. Kurt must have allies.”



“In the force itself?” My father asked.



“Male ghosts doing his bidding in the force. Probably to tip him off.”



“But why would male ghosts help him at all?” My mother asked.



“Think about it. He’s a murderer. Freak. Psychopath. Surely there are male spirits who are fans of his work.” My father declared.  



“I’m heading for the farm. There, we should be safe with weapons and necessities that’ll last us for weeks,” My mother said.



“Not the camp, Mom. Kurt knows about it. Head to “Lover Lane Street”. There are houses still under construction where we can set up for now. It’ll be empty at night. It’s a long drive from here, we’re going to need more fuel.”



We stopped at a gas station and while my mother filled up the car, I hurried inside to grab some snacks and water. As I handed a couple bucks to the cashier for a pack of water and some snacks, he gave me a strange look and whispered as he handed me my change.



“Why would a woman run away from a wedding? It’s sacred,” the cashier said, glaring at me. I touched his hand on the counter, and it felt cold like ice, like a dead man. At that moment, I realized he was a ghost, and I bolted out of the gas station. Outside, I found my parents screaming inside the running car, a bare-chested man pounding on the windshield, howling like a wild animal. My father, Todd, knocked him off the windshield with a single shot from his rifle.



“Martie! Hurry!” my mother shouted. I threw the pack of water and snacks in the backseat and slammed the door shut as my father sped off down the road.



“Oh, God. Call the cops, Todd. Do something.”



“I’ve called everyone. They think I’m crazy.”



As my parents argued over the mess, we’ve gotten ourselves into, the car lurched to a stop in traffic. I knew Kurt, he was persistent and had this rebellious edge about him. He wouldn’t just give up on me this easily. My gaze shifted out the window, catching something strange. My parents fell silent, following my look toward the road, where dozens of men, dressed in disheveled clothing, stepped out of car trunks. No doubt they were looking for me, who will camp in a trunk just for fun, these were male spirits working for Kurt.



“Get out of the car. Run!” I shouted to my parents.



We leapt out of the car as the ghosts surged toward us. My parents fired round after round, each shot knocking them down, only for them to rise again after a moment. We turned and bolted, leaving everything we owned in the car. Around us, other motorists abandoned their cars and joined the scramble as even more male ghosts emerged from trunks. Some motorists were brave enough to confront them, sparking a chaotic fight that bought us precious moments to escape. For now, my parents and I were safe, but who knew for how long?  

  
  


Lover Lane St was a half-finished neighborhood, with plenty of places to hide and prepare for whatever Kurt and his allies had planned for me tonight. My phone buzzed repeatedly with Kurt’s calls, but I ignored every one of them. By now, he must have realized that I’d uncovered his secret. Any love I once felt for him was gone. I was prepared to do whatever it took to protect myself and my family, even if it meant sticking a knife down his throat. That evening, my best friend Nash, the one who had introduced me to Kurt, called. My parents had warned me not to take any calls for the time being, but I trusted Nash; she was like a sister to me, and I knew that I could trust her with anything. Ignoring my parents' warnings, I answered and quickly confided to Nash everything about Kurt, including my location, though I made her promise not to tell anyone. She apologized profusely for ever setting me up with Kurt before hanging up. By midnight my parents were asleep, as always. I was the only one on guard, clutching a shotgun, as I hid in one of the unfinished houses. Through an exposed window, I spotted a car slowly circling the area. I cocked my shotgun, my heart pounding, and to my horror, saw Kurt behind the wheel, with Nash sitting beside him. I was stunned. Why had she brought him here? Did she not believe me or had she been part of this all along? I quickly woke my parents as Kurt and Nash got out of the car. Kurt was holding a chainsaw, and Nash wielded a baseball bat. In that chilling moment, I realized the truth: Nash had been working with him all along. It all made sense now—she must have been the one who set up his victims, luring women into his deadly trap.



“We warned you about telling anyone where you were at?” My father whispered.



“Save your energy, Todd. It’s going to be a long night,” My mother said.



Kurt stopped in the middle of the street, checking out the countless unfinished houses. He started his chainsaw and began speaking to me.



“I’m the boogeyman, Martie. When you are this beautiful, like me, you tend to veer toward a certain kind of weirdness that few can understand. Dates are boring. Marriage is overrated. I wanted something that could make me feel fresh, unique, and rivetingly dangerous. So, I began cutting people up and eating them. Those poor women, at the beginning, their faces would shine like the sun hovering over us, but as soon as they found out that I was more interested in their skin, than bedding them, their lovely faces began to fade into oblivion. Sadly, they would not leave me alone, and now they are helping the woman I’m truly in love with this time. Come on, Martie, wedding is in three days, I promise not to do you harm.” 



My father fired shots, missing Kurt and Nash, as they covered behind the car. Suddenly, a large number of dead women and men appeared from opposite sides of the neighborhood, holding knives, walking towards each other, ready to square. What happened next was so shocking to even comprehend. But it was live, right in front of our eyes, ghosts knifing each other, screaming, and getting back up, ready for more fighting.



“Martie, Run.” My mother shouted.



“Go, girl. We’ve had a great ride. You get out of here now!!!”



I teared up and took off down the street, making my way into a two-story unfinished house, hiding inside the kitchen. My shotgun was empty, so I snatched onto a knife on the counter, ready to defend myself. All I heard were ghosts brawling in the street, smashing into wood, like a never-ending fight.



From the sound of approaching footsteps, someone was outside.



I got to my feet slowly and slipped out of the kitchen, quickly climbing up the stairs to the second floor. The rooms had no doors. I hid beneath a bedroom, clutching my knife, ready for Kurt to come looking for me. I heard more footsteps ascending the stairs and entering the hall. After a moment, the footsteps stopped—right inside the room I was hiding. I recognized Kurt’s blue shiny shoes, the ones he loved to wear at night, and my heart began to race.



The chainsaw fired up.



Kurt started slicing through the mattress fabric. He didn’t even glance under the bed, but I knew he sensed I was there. Next, the chainsaw tore into the foam and springs, each layer disappearing as he drew closer. Soon, it would reach the wood frame, and then my head. I held my ground, wanting to see just how far he’d go. When the chainsaw finally bit into the wooden frame, I screamed and heard Kurt’s whisper.



“Houston, we have a problem.”



Kurt tossed aside pieces of the shredded mattress only until the frame was left. He looked down at me, his gaze twisted with a sickening blend of perversion and hunger. In that instant, I knew how deeply I’d messed up getting involved with him, but it was too late.



“Do as you please,” I said. “And be quick about it.”



He smiled. “No, No, Martie. Wedding first. Food later.”



I slowly got out from under the wooden frame and hid my knife in my back pocket. I got up and glared at him, but I was defenseless; he was a big man with a chainsaw, there was no way I could take him.



Kurt shut off the chainsaw and let it clatter to the wooden floor. Male ghosts began to flow into the room, armed with all sorts of weapons. The fight raged outside, but these spirits weren’t here to kill me—they were here to officiate the wedding. One of them was dressed like a pastor.



Kurt straightened his suit and stepped closer to me. We locked eyes as the ghost pastor positioned himself between us, ready to begin the ceremony.



“Dear beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the union of Martie… and Kurt Monarch in holy matrimony. Martie, do you take Kurt Monarch to be your lawful wedded husband, to love, honor, and cherish him for all the days of your life.”



I flipped Kurt. “No. I don’t. Who’d marry such a freakish monster.”



Kurt didn’t seem bothered much. The pastor (ghost) continued. “And Kurt Monarch, do you take Martie to be your lawful wedded wife, to love, honor, and cherish her for all the days of your life.”



Kurt blew a kiss at me. “I do.”



“Kurt Monarch, please place the ring on Martie’s finger.”



Kurt grabbed the ring from his pocket and stepped closer to me.



I stepped back in disgust, angering him and the others.



Kurt picked up the chainsaw on the wooden floor and revved it to life.

Moving closer to me, Kurt raised the roaring chainsaw inches from my face. Sweat trickled down my temples, fear gripped me—but that’s exactly where I wanted him. Close enough for me to pull the knife from my back pocket and stab him, which is what I DID in one swift motion.



A guy like Kurt wasn’t going to let himself be taken out by a knife. He disarmed me and slipped my knife into his pocket. He forced the ring onto my finger and motioned at the pastor to continue.



“And now, Martie, please place the ring on Kurt Monarch’s finger.”



First off, I had no ring on me, and even if I did, I wasn’t going to place it on Kurt’s finger. But he had already arranged everything, so he took another ring from his pocket and handed it to me. I grabbed the ring with disgust and placed it on his finger.



“By the power vested in me, I now—-”



“Hold on.” I shouted, stepping away from Kurt and addressing the spirits in the room, who were multiplying by the minutes.



“I can’t speak to your twisted loyalty to this man. But I wonder? Some of you must have sisters. What if I were your sister, how would you feel?” I was trying to appeal to their emotions, hoping they might turn against Kurt and save me from marrying a monster, and from a brutal, agonizing death. Instead, they just laughed at my face.



“Good try, Martie. Keep going, we don’t have all night,” Kurt said.



The pastor (ghost) spoke up. “By the power vested in me, I now—”



“I’m pregnant!” I screamed, grabbing their stunned attention. It was a lie of course, but I knew they wouldn’t go as far as to gut a pregnant woman.



Kurt interjected. “She’s lying. I never impregnated her. Finish the line.”



The pastor seemed hesitant and paused. “Are you certain, Kurt. I mean we’re talking about a baby here.”



Kurt started getting strange looks from his male counterparts, who seemed to doubt him. That was all the opportunity I needed to make a break for it. The house was two stories tall, jumping out the window would hurt, but I had no choice.



With a scream, I leapt out the window, landing hard on the street below, and straining my ankle. I could hear footsteps pounding down the stairs as squad cars arrived at the scene. I lay on the pavement as officers surrounded me, guns drawn, bombarding me with questions.



My parents ran toward my location and embraced me. I asked about Nash, the best-friend who’d betrayed me, and my father responded harshly. “That snake’s gone.” We made it through the night, but we were the only ones left. No sign of any ghosts remained, men or women, they had vanished as soon as the sirens sounded. But one person was still out there, Kurt. I knew that if I could get rid of Kurt, his ghostly followers would stop harassing me. So, my parents and I came up with a story for the cops to hear.



“Thugs. Not from the area. They took our money, but we fought them just as hard, officer,” I said, as my parents corroborated my story. I knew Kurt was hiding somewhere in the house, waiting for everyone to leave the scene, but I wasn’t going to let him slip by. He had to pay for his crimes. 



My father slipped a shank into my pocket. “Go get him, girl.” While my parents distracted the officers and medics, I slipped into the house to confront Kurt. I found him standing in the kitchen, gripping his chainsaw.



“You’ve outsmarted me, Martie.”



Kurt was bigger and stronger, but I had rage on my side, and the silent support of women he’d murdered and eaten over the years. Fighting him wasn’t my plan, I wanted him to confess his crimes on video. I’d placed my phone strategically in my pocket, meaning our interaction was being recorded. All I needed now was to make him talk.



“I’m sickened for falling for a murderer,” I said.



“Women are like chameleons. Today they love you. And tomorrow, well…”



“Why me, I don’t get it?” I asked.



“Just like the others. You craved for your white knight.”



“You know what they call men like you? Pathetic tiny losers, with a SIM card between their legs.” That line hit hard, he became reddish and livid.



I pressed him up. “Oh, poor Kurt couldn’t get it up. How many times have I had to stroke that SIM card, just to get it to barely work.”



“Stop, you bitch.”



“Do your followers know that you cannot perform? Such a big muscular body, yet nothing to show for it.”



“Enough, Martie.”



I aimed the shank at Kurt. “I’m sure the girls were stunned. And they giggled. And even today, in death, they’re still laughing at your cock.”



Kurt became even more unhinged. “And that’s why I killed and ate the first one. And I killed even more. Women shouldn’t laugh at me. It’s not my fault!” There, that’s the line I was waiting for. Just as I pulled my phone out of my pocket, my phone’s battery died. I started to panic, but it was no use, the phone was dead.



A refreshing smirk appeared on Kurt’s lips. “Too bad. You were so close.”



Kurt’s hand pounced on my neck and brought me to the floor. He covered my screams with his knee pressed on my mouth. 



“Since you have a shank. It’ll be self-defense. Good-bye, Martie.”



He lowered the chainsaw toward my stomach, ready to cut me open. Then I noticed the knife I’d tried to stab him with earlier, tucked into his pocket. I seized it and drove it into his chest several times, shouting at the top of my lungs as I pushed his knee off my mouth.



Kurt rolled over me, his hands still gripping the chainsaw.



My parents and the officers rushed into the room just as Kurt took his last breaths. The officers surrounded his body, checking for any sign of life. I looked over my shoulder and saw the spirits of the women he’d killed, their faces softened with gratitude. I gave them a small smile and raised a thumbs-up in return, a silent acknowledgment of justice served.
