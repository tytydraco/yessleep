I loved to be around the wires. They were always reliable and never had to be recharged. The only issue with them was the wire’s life. If there was any problem, you had to buy another. But wired stuff was cheaper.

But for the first time, I tried Bluetooth earbuds — noise-cancelling ones. I was very excited to use them.

I put the earbud in my ear and waited for the silence to cover me.

It was fabulous. I couldn’t hear a thing — the fan, the washing machine — nothing at all. It was just perfect for me. I started doing my office work while using the earbuds in my ears and maybe some songs in the background.

The office colleagues were tired of me and my new habit of listening to music while working because they literally had to walk to me to say something.

One morning, I woke up late and decided to work from home. Work from home is perfect, but the only issue is that there’s no login time and logoff time, no tea break or lunch break. You end up working the whole day and might get overwhelmed.

I was sitting on the chair, and my laptop was on the table in front of me. My room light bulb was just above me, giving me no shadows to get distracted.

I put the earbuds in my ears and started listening to music while working on the code.

There were many things on my desk — my laptop, AC remote, my Iron Man figures, and some books. So basically, the whole desk was full. I loved playing with the Iron Man figures in between my work. They were kind of my stress busters.

While working, I felt a cold spot near my neck. I ignored it and continued working. But again, the same kind of cold spot hit my neck. I took the AC remote and turned it off.

After some time, the room began to feel warmer.  
The cold spots were gone.  
I glanced at the clock on my laptop screen — it was a little past 10 PM.  
Time for dinner.

I made chapatis and some chickpeas for myself.  
When I walked into the kitchen, a strange, foul smell hit me.  
I covered my nose and looked around to find where it was coming from.  
Nothing.  
I sprayed some air freshener and took a deep breath.  
The smell was gone — at least in the kitchen.

I looked at my plate. It was covered with another plate. I walked to it, the smell was in the air, and a smile on my face. I uncovered the plate.

It was empty.

“I… I remember that I served my food.”

I looked around. I checked the fridge, I checked my oven, and everywhere else. But the food was nowhere.

“Did I not cook today?” I asked myself. “Maybe I was too busy and just thought that I cooked?”

I shrugged off the thoughts and ordered food online.

The foul smell still covered the house. I had to spray the room freshener multiple times.

The sun rose again. It lit up my room. I slowly opened my eyes and grabbed my phone. The screen flashed the time. I was late again. So I decided to work from home once again.

The day went by with me listening to music and doing work. But because of a sudden lot of work pressure, I had to work till late night.

That day, again, I was working late. I had a cup of coffee to keep myself awake and avoid sleeping.

After some time, I walked to my chair. After a deep sigh, I descended into the seat. To my surprise, the armrest was already warm.

“I left the chair a while ago… It should be cold.” I looked at my AC; it was on. I unlocked the screen, letting the colors reflect in my eyes.

I put my earbuds back in my ears and played the loud music.

While my fingers were clicking on the keyboard, I again felt the cold spots. As before, I turned off the AC and waited for the warmth. But for some reason, my body turned warmer, yet my neck was still cold. A cold breeze kept touching my neck.

Without turning, I placed my hand on my neck. A chill ran down my spine. I felt breathing on my hand. It was like someone was standing there and breathing.

I took a deep breath and turned.

There was no one.

The whole room was empty.

I turned my head around to check for anyone hiding. But there was no one. I was all alone in my room — I was alone at that moment only. Because there were muddy footprints on the floor. I followed them.

The footprints came into the house from the main door, which was locked from the inside. I always lock it. But the footprints came in and walked to my room. It seemed someone was standing behind me, and there were no footprints showing them leaving.

“Someone is in the house…” I said in a shaky voice.

I grabbed my phone, locked my bedroom from outside, and called the police.

“We are coming in 15 minutes. Please stay hidden,” they said.

I was standing in the hall. Without any protection. I didn’t know where to hide. I wasn’t even sure where that intruder was. He could be anywhere — he could be in my bedroom, which I locked; he could be in the kitchen, bathroom — anywhere.

I slowly kept walking towards the main door.

“If he is in the house, standing out in the public might be a good idea,” I thought.

I unlocked the door and stepped out. My hand was still holding the door knob, ready to close the door. I was facing outside, and my back was toward the house.

I heard someone rushing towards me — someone was running.

Without looking, I closed the door and locked it from outside. Whoever was inside started knocking.

“Open the door and let me out\~” the voice came.

He wasn’t begging. He was not scared. He was humming while knocking on the door.

My teary eyes were fixed on the door. With my shaky breath, I walked back. I tried to be near the road as much as possible without getting knocked by the cars. I was ready to run if something happened.

The knocking continued.

I stood near the road, shaking. Suddenly, the knocking stopped. A shadow emerged near the window. Someone was walking towards the window. I prepared myself. Suddenly, the shadow stopped. It didn’t appear in front of the window but stayed there.

The police arrived.

I pointed toward the window and gave them the keys to my house. With guns in their hands, all five officers walked in.

I saw them separating into three groups — one leading to the kitchen, another towards the bedroom, and the last one entering the living room. The shadow was still there, at the window. But the officers didn’t notice.

I walked into the house slowly. I turned toward the window.

There was a night lamp standing 5 feet 8 inches tall and casting a shadow on the wall behind it.

“The house is clear,” the officers said. After writing the report, they left.

I was standing alone in the house. Scared.

I went into the bedroom. The laptop was still on the desk with all my other stuff. I slowly sat on the chair, which again was warm. I was a bit confident because the officer confirmed that there was no one in the house.

I locked the doors and locked my bedroom door as well. I left the lights on while I decided to sleep. For a few hours, my eyes were wide open. I was unable to sleep.

After some time, my eyes decided to rest.

I closed my eyes, falling asleep. The fan kept blowing air. The blow was faster for some reason. I slept peacefully. I avoided thinking about anything and just let the airflow on my face.

The sunlight hit my eyes. I woke up. I grabbed my phone and checked the time. I was on time. But I decided to work from home once again. I left the bed and went to the washroom to get fresh.

After getting fresh, I returned to my bed and noticed some stains on my bed sheet. I looked closely — they weren’t fresh. But they weren’t there the night before when I decided to sleep.

I pulled the bed sheet and put it in the washing machine.

I had to start work. I turned on my laptop and started working. After some time, when the whole house was echoing with the washing machine’s sound and the noise of vehicles from outside, I decided to put the earbuds in my ears again.

In the infinite silence, I kept on working. The sun was still in the sky. I was staring at the laptop screen, going through the report.

The cold spot hit my neck once again. With my eyes still on the laptop, I picked up the AC remote and clicked the “turn on/off” button. The AC gave out a small jingle. My eyes shifted toward it. The sound was of the AC turning on.

My jaw dropped. I was still feeling cold blows on my neck. With a shivering body, I slowly turned back. The cold blow faded. There was nothing behind me.

I returned to my laptop. My eyes were on the screen, but my brain was still trying to process it. My hands were still trembling. I started scrolling through the report while still thinking about the cold spots.

I felt them again — this time on my neck and shoulder. I looked up toward the AC — it was on. I tried to ignore the cold air and continued my work.

After some time, because of continuous earbud use, my ears started aching. I decided to take them out for a while. My hands moved toward my ears, passing through the cold air blowing on my neck, and I slowly took out the earbuds.

My body froze in shock. I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t. I wanted to run, but my body didn’t move. Without the earbuds, I could hear the breathing behind me. Someone was near my right ear, breathing hard.

My heart started racing.

Two cold hands touched my hands from behind and guided them to put the earbuds back into my ears.

I jumped from my seat and turned back.

The cold blow stopped. There were many footprints on the floor. This time, they were leaving my room. I gathered my courage and slowly followed them.

The footprints were all over the house, followed by a severe foul smell. I closed my nose with one hand and clenched a fist with the other, prepared for anything.

The footprints ended at the main door again.  
That day someone entered the house.  
And now, someone left the house.

I stood there, staring at the footprints.  
Cold air brushed the back of my neck.  
I could hear someone breathing behind me.  
The earbuds were still in my ears — noise cancellation was off.  
And then, without me touching them…  
It turned on.  
Silence.  
Total silence.  
But the breath…  
it was still there.

Do you ever feel… the breath? When you put on those noise-cancelling earbuds… like something else is listening too?
