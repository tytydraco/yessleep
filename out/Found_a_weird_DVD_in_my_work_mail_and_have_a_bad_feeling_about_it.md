Hey guys. Longtime lurker but only made my account recently. Don’t post often but something weird happened a few days ago and I thought it’d be worth sharing.

&#x200B;

I teach at a local college, and we have a staff common area where we can pick up mail that gets redirected to the college. Students also turn in papers there depending on what the professor asks for. I don’t really use mine but occasionally I get some ads, promotions for grad programs, etc. so I let things stack for a bit.

&#x200B;

Anyway, last week someone tells me the room is starting to smell really bad, and they think it’s coming from my mail slot. When I went in, sure enough, there was a really bad smell. I can’t really describe it as anything other than stale, rotten meat. (If you’ve ever been in a butcher’s shop, it’s almost exactly like that. My dad used to take me to the local meat shop, and I’d always get whiffs of it from behind the counter.)

&#x200B;

I look through the slot, and there’s not really anything weird at first (I thought maybe an animal was in there or rotten food, crazy but what else could be giving off that smell?) and that’s when I found this dusty CD sleeve stuck between some papers.

&#x200B;

I took the sleeve out and immediately felt grossed out. It was sticky, like someone spilled soda on it. But there weren’t any stains. I thought the smell was coming from the sleeve, but when I opened it up it was coming from the CD actually. I don’t know how or why, but the CD just smelt like rotten meat. I can’t explain it.

&#x200B;

I probably should have thrown it out, but curiosity got the better of me and I took it home. When I looked at it more closely, I saw it’s not a CD but actually a DVD, an old Memorex DVD (not sure if anyone remembers the brand). I distinctly remember them because my parents used to save old home videos on them. In fact, I almost thought it WAS one of the old videos they saved since there’s a date on it in black ink: 11-25-92. On the top there’s a title that’s blacked out.

&#x200B;

I started getting freaked out honestly but chalked it up to coincidence. Obviously someone put it there by accident. Why would they send me a weird DVD? But maybe it was for me and I had missed it for maybe weeks or months. But the smell was so weird. You couldn’t miss that.

&#x200B;

I have a detachable drive lying around that I use to play some old movies, so I hooked it up and put the DVD in. I half-expected it to be dead but it worked. And there was a video on it. It was just called HALL which I thought was weird, not even an event or holiday.

&#x200B;

Of course I played it. It was a short clip, just 11 seconds, half of it basically too dark to see anything. There’s this semi-loud hum in the background, kind of like an overactive AC unit. Then near the end, the camera pans over this door that’s slightly open. There’s this hard red light coming from behind the door (really red, like blood). This is when the video starts artifacting, bugging out. Then it just ends. You can’t see anything past the door.

&#x200B;

Needless to say I have no clue what it means or why it was in my slot. I shot out a couple of mass emails to my students and coworkers about if anyone lost an old DVD, but nothing’s come back yet. I know I should probably throw it out, especially given the smell, but something about it keeps pulling me back. I think about the door a lot. About what’s behind it.

&#x200B;

Anyway, curious if anyone’s seen something like this before? I exported the video and put it on Youtube if anyone’s curious. I also took some footage of the DVD. I’ll make another post if something comes up.

**EDIT:** 

Thanks for all the comments. Some of you are wondering about the date and quality. Honestly I don’t know either. I’m thinking the original footage was maybe recorded in 92 and then transferred over to the disc? Maybe it was cleaned up? But why use a DVD now if it’s recent?

&#x200B;

I also didn’t know that there might be more data on the DVD so I took time to clean it and played it more. Eventually there WAS something else that came up. It’s two short clips of what looks like water, but it’s red. I don’t want to think it’s blood, but especially with that smell, I get this sick feeling looking at it. Like it’s not water but meat. Wriggling meat.

&#x200B;

(One of you said the smell might be the ink on the disc, but I don’t know. I almost feel like the smell’s on me now.)

&#x200B;

Anyway. There’s a sound in the background of the red water video. Breathing. Breathing and then crying. Some woman crying. I grabbed that footage, too, but I’m honestly shaking just typing this. These videos are getting stuck in my head.

&#x200B;

Some of you said to take it to the police, but maybe it’s too late??
