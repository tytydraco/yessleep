I’ve (19F) always been like a weird person. I’ve never really had friends and I’ve been chronically online for as long as I can remember. I started my first tumblr account when I was literally 8 years old. I used to be into reading (though I preferred long tumblr text posts to books but like still) but when I got into high school I just couldn’t read any more. I tried to focus but my mind wandered and it felt like one word took ten minutes to read and I’d rather just be on tumblr. But I had to read books for assignments. So I started to watch the movie versions instead.

I really liked movies throughout the first part of high school. I liked multi-hour YouTube videos or twitch streams more but I still really liked movies. I stopped going to the movie theatre eventually because I can’t stand waiting in line and then waiting through trailers and then waiting through the whole movie but I could just stream movies on Amazon and fast forward through anything boring.
Anyway then I found more fun in watching shorter YouTube videos where it was like ten minutes and then I go to the next one and it’s a whole new topic. A whole movie is so goddamn boring it’s like an hour and a half of the same shit but a ten minute YouTube video is perfect.

But then towards the end of high school I got into TikTok. I always was like I’d rather DIE than use TikTok because it’s such fucking brain rot but I’m nothing if not chronically online and TikTok is a lot more interesting than ten minute YouTube videos. That’s ten whole minutes I’m wasting on whatever stupid bullshit. TikTok is like thirty seconds a video and I can just switch to the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one and the next the ne thr next the n
It’s awesome. I don’t make my own TikToks though because that would be cringe lmao. I shouldn’t have gotten my iPhone in white though because it blends in with my skin. For some reason my phone doesn’t fit into any phone case. Not that I could choose one anyway because I’m always changing what aesthetic I’m into.

Anyway point is, lately I’ve had trouble even watching thirty second TikToks. They have like fifteen second ones so I started watching those and scrolling off anything that’s longer than that but even those are getting boring. They feel…so long. Every video feels like it takes ten years off my life just from waiting for it to be over. The other night I was watching the longest fucking Shein try on haul and I was about to scroll but I looked at my thumb and it was bony and thin. It didn’t use to be like that. It looked withered or something. This is what I mean like these stupid videos take decades off my lifespan!

My mom used to be on me all the fucking time to get off my phone and go outside but it’s so boring outside. She says my attention span is absolute shit and I told her to shut up. It’s been a while now since she’s come into my room I don’t think I’ve seen her for like…a few days or something. But point is I’m thinking she might’ve been right? Like my attention span is REALLY bad. I keep scrolling through TikTok but it just feels empty. Every video is so long and boring.

Today I accidentally unplugged my phone and it died. In the black screen all I could see was my own face, withered and bare with pale, sagging skin and greying hair. For a brief moment I looked at my room, plates of rotting food and bony carcasses covering the floor, the stained, yellow wallpaper peeling off. When was the last time my mom brought me food? I can’t remember her face anymore. When was the last time I ate? I turned my phone back on quickly. I don’t want to see that again.

I can’t do anything anymore. The internet was my sanctuary but now everything is just…boring. I know it doesn’t sound that bad but trust me it is. I can’t take in any amount of information anymore. I tried to reverse it I really did. I started watching longer TikToks. It felt like physical pain having to sit through something that fucking boring. It felt like a rock crushing my skull. I read longer Reddit posts, even though they’re all fucking boring too. But I forced myself to read the words. It takes hours. I don’t know how long it’s been since I’ve seen my parents. My only human interaction now is posting to Reddit. 

This used to be fun but now I’m bored again.
