My coworker told me that at the right angle of light you can see her skull. Her photo hung in an old and under visited corner of the theater, where dust mites congregated and cobwebs clung to the hardwood walls.


“Eww, that’s gross,” I said to her.


“Oh sorry”, she said, smiling, “I thought that you might find it interesting.”


In theory I did find it interesting. In practice,  sweat dripped down my brow, even if it was the dead of winter. The old theater wasn’t insulated, phantoms of ghastly wind haunted the wide rows and hallways. Sometimes when I was in the theater, I could swear someone rushed by on the side of the mezzanine while I was seating patrons, a swirl of black, a figure of nothing but shadows, an eidolon of white noise.


“Jeez,” I said,”You’re scaring me.”


“It’s true”, she said, “go by the Lydia Morris education wing sometime.”


“Listen, Dana, I just want to get through this shift and get home.”


“Okay okay,” she said, “It’s just.. board members like to leave things behind. Some may say, their ghos—”


“Let’s get this meeting started, shall we?” The Head Usher joined the circle. He was wearing a spiffy tie and black coat, which only served to make me jealous about how much more money he was making than us.


I never cared for classical music. This might make me sound inhuman, or to some particularly stuffy people, anti-human, but hear me out. I don’t understand why these people, who don’t clap between movements, who don’t cheer or dance, need to be escorted around like overgrown babies. Every night from 7:30 to 8:00 pm, my heart races and my head swims, trying to play human tetris with hundreds of aging aristocrats. They can’t even pay to keep this place in working condition.


Once everyone was settled, the Head Usher came by.


“You can take your break now.”


“Okay, thank you. Fifteen minutes?”


“As always.”


Moonlight seeped its way into the house, bone-white against the velveteen floors. As I was walking to the locker room, I  passed the Lydia Morris education wing. A shock of fear ran up my spine. The education wing beckoned, as if it had an outstretched index finger, pulling me closer. I pried open the door to the education wing. The operations team didn’t bother to turn on the lights, or what little semblance of heating they had. My skin broke out in gooseflesh, my teeth chattered. In a pallid sliver of moonlight, Lydia Morris’s portrait hung, her hair dipped down her shoulders, and she smiled the only kind of smile billionaire donors know how to. Toothy, with no soul. 


And behind the painting,..


I screamed, muffled by the roaring wind from beyond the window.


Her skull gleamed, every inch of bone, yellowed with age, staring at me with those hollow eyes.
The Head Usher came behind me. His face was obscured by the pure darkness of the Education wing, as if his skin was a cowl for a creature that lurked beneath.


“Sorry,” he said, “Aren’t you supposed to be on break? This is no place for you.”
