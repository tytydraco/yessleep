I work the most boring 9 to 5 you can imagine, in Fort Worth. I spend my day moving numbers from one spreadsheet to another for a stupid megacorp that pays me enough. One day, on my walk to work, I met this homeless man on the side of St. Patrick's Cathedral. And I (unintentionally) gave him a dirty look because he smelled like shit and mold and had big burn scars on his arms. Then he yelled at me, “Don’t FUCKING stare at me!” I jolted back, and he threw some trash at me. I ran away until I couldn’t see him anymore.

“Crazy ass hobo,” I mumbled to myself, and then I made my way to work, eventually settling down and getting some “work” done.

When I went home, I didn’t see the homeless freak, but I did see his trash heap and blanket, and being the good city goer I am, I threw it away in a trash can across the street.

I made my way back home, watered my plants, and started making dinner for myself.

The next day, after I brushed my teeth and made my way to the kitchen, I saw my rose plant. It wasn’t its usual rose red but a pale pink. I didn’t think much of it; it probably just didn’t get enough water. And when I started walking to work, I had completely forgotten it. On my way to work, I came to the church again. The homeless man was there again. “What now?” I thought. I came closer to him, giving him a stank eye. Suddenly lunging at me, throwing me to the ground, screaming, “I’M NOT GOING TO BURN TO DEATH, YOU BASTARD!” I tried getting him off of me, but he pinned me to the ground, and his mouth came closer to my head, and his mangy mouth snapped at my ear, where he tore it off. I felt my blood fall to my shoulder. I screamed so unbelievably hard it clearly scared the hell out of him. And then finally, my adrenaline helped me shove his dirty ass off of me, and I ran blocks away and called 911. I told them that there was a homeless man that just bit my ear off and that I needed medical attention. An ambulance and a police car came. I had the medics patch my ear up and told the police what happened to me. They told me that they would arrest him and that he would likely go to a mental health facility.

I went to the hospital, and they stitched up my head. They told me that they couldn’t recover my ear and that I would have to live without my right ear. I asked if they had any surgery or bionic options; they showed me a couple, but they were REALLY expensive.

I also asked for rabies shots, as I was SURE that the mangy vagabond was a carrier. They “assured” me that was unnecessary, and they wrote me a prescription for half a dozen different pills. I got a taxi to Walgreens, grabbed my prescription, and had my driver get me back home. I took 4-5 pills, and then I saw it.

My rose plant. It wasn’t its pale pink anymore, but a wilting, sickly, and depressing white. I love my plants; they’re the only part of my life that doesn’t suck. I take care of them, research them, water them according to every plant, and try my best to give them the perfect amount of sunlight in my shoddy apartment. My roses were my favorite plant, and now they were wilting and dying. I watered them (though they were 100% dead at this point) and went to bed.

The next morning I called work and told them why I didn’t come in and that I wasn’t coming in today. I went to my kitchen to check my living room and saw my rose plant, now with little red ants crawling on it. Ants?! Ants?! I checked all around my apartment to find out where those wretched red freaks came from, but I couldn’t find it. I went back to my poor plant to brush off the conniving ants, but they started to crawl on me. First a couple, and I tried to flick them off, but more and more came; I fell back on my ass, trying to get them off!!

I tried and tried to get them off! But more and more kept marching on to me! Then they started to burrow into me! “WTF?! WTF?! Wtf?!” My thoughts were frantic, and I felt my skin begin to itch and itch and itch!!

It hurt. I hurt like the devil himself commanded these ants. I glanced back at my rose plant and saw that the homeless man was staring at me; his bloodlusting eyes wanted me dead. He put those fucking ants on my plant, he killed my rose plant, and he’s going to FUCKING EAT ME!

“I have to get out.” I rushed to my stove and put my arm on it and lit it. I knew that it would hurt, but compared to the itch, the fire felt relaxing. It felt soothing. I need more; I need to get them out, or I will die. I knew this instinctually: HE'S GOING TO EAT ME! I'M GOING TO DIE! I'M GOING TO DIE! I'M GOING TO DIE!

I woke up in a white, medical-smelling room.

My arms hurt bad, but they didn’t itch.

I was covered head to toe in bandages.

In my bed there was a bouquet of roses, with a get-well-soon card from my boss.

A nurse came down and explained what happened to me. I had a “mental health episode” and called my boss, yelling about a homeless man that tried to burn your arms off with ants. So he called 911, and when the paramedics got there, I was passed out, and my arms were burned really badly.

My doctor talked on and on about insurance and something about medication… I don’t remember what else she said; my brain went fuzzy, and I kept thinking about that homeless man. I can see his eyes burned into my brain. I know that he was there—I know that I’m NOT crazy. I’ve lived my whole life never having an “episode,” as she called it.

The following days I had a therapist come in; he was nice and all, but he kept trying to get me to believe that I was insane. I am not insane. I am NOT insane. They released me two or so weeks after and gave me schizoid medication. I've been taking sense they prescribed, but I still don't believe I need it.

I went to bed last night and saw him again.
