They came when the clocks stopped—not with ships or fire, but as a *presence*, thick as cancer in the air. You don’t understand. They were *always* here. Waiting. Hungry.  

Ten years ago, I left my research team to die in the Yukon permafrost. Their voices still haunt my whiskey-laced nights—*“Don’t close the hatch, Elias!”*—as the avalanche buried them. But guilt is a compass. It led Them to me.  

It began with the walls. They *sweated*. A viscous, iridescent film that smelled of burnt hair and spoiled honey. Then the nightmares: visions of Henrik and Mara, my colleagues, their frostbitten faces pressed against my bedroom window, whispering, *“We’re so cold, Elias. Let us in.”* But when I woke, the glass was smeared with that same oily residue, frozen in clawed streaks.  

They manifested on the solstice. The temperature plummeted until my breath crystallized into tiny shards that cut my lips. Shadows in the hallway *breathed*. Then, a sound—wet sinew stretched over bone—and I saw *it*: a thing shaped like Mara, if Mara had been flayed and stitched back together with veins of glowing cobalt. Her jaw unhinged, revealing a nest of translucent tendrils that sang in Henrik’s voice. *“You left us in the ice. Now we’ll freeze the hell out of you.”*  

The house warped. Doorways yawned into corridors of pulsating meat, ribbed with cartilage. The floorboards split, oozing black fluid that writhed with half-formed faces. I tried to flee, but the front door fused into a wall of teeth. Behind me, the thing that wore Mara’s skin advanced, tendrils whipping like serpents, each tip splitting into a screaming mouth.  

*“They want communion,”* it hissed. *“Not with you. With your regret.”*  

It seized me, its touch searing like dry ice. My vision fractured. Suddenly, I was back in the Yukon, reliving it—the roar of snow, Mara’s hand slapping the hatch as I sealed it. But this time, They showed me the *after*. How the ice didn’t kill them. How It *dug them up*. How Their tendrils slithered into my friends’ corpses, puppeteering frozen flesh, feasting on the echoes of their terror.  

I vomited bile. The creature laughed, a sound like glaciers collapsing. *“Rot is a language. Decay, a prayer. You* gifted *us a feast.”*  

They dragged me to the basement. The walls were alive now, carpeted in undulating tumors that pulsed with stolen memories. In the center hung a grotesque altar—a fusion of Henrik’s ribcage and Mara’s spinal column, fused with jagged ice and throbbing alien tissue. The thing forced my hand into the structure.  

Agony. A million winters coursed through me. I felt Their hunger, ancient and insatiable—a craving for the rot festering in human souls. Guilt, They showed me, is *delicious*. It ripens in the dark.  

When I woke, dawn was a gray wound on the horizon. The house stood normal, save for the frost etching my skin in fractal patterns. And the whispers. Always the whispers.  

They’re coming again tonight. I’ve laid out Mara’s parka, Henrik’s spectacles. An offering. Maybe this time, They’ll take me instead of the memories.  

But some hungers can’t be sated.
