If you lived in the Northwest in the mid-to-late eighties, you might remember hearing of a girl named Chastity Cane. In fact, I think it's probably stranger if you *hadn't* heard of her.

But, for the uninitiated, Chastity Cane was a 9-year-old girl who went missing from a quaint, middle class suburb of Seattle in the summer of 1987. She was from one of those idyllic neighborhoods where everyone knows everyone. Your textbook great place to settle down with your mortgage and your two and a half kids, I'm sure you all know the type.

It's safe to say that that atmosphere, that allure of safety and community, was utterly wrecked when, on a cloudless night in June, little Chastity went missing from her bedroom without so much as a trace of evidence. Her yearbook picture, showing her smiling wide with a mouth full of braces, hair tied with bows in twin pigtails, was plastered on milk cartons, missing posters, and the like. She was a cute kid, but more importantly, she was a good little white Catholic girl; something bad happening to her was seemingly unfathomable.

I had been freshly promoted to Detective, absolutely exuding confidence that I would fast learn was entirely unwarranted. The disappearance of Chastity Cane was the first high-profile case I worked on, under the supervision of one Det. Marcus Mullahy, may he rest in peace. Mullahy was a good man and an even better detective, so it was bad news that he was absolutely stumped.

I still remember going into her bedroom like it was yesterday. The air in there was different, colder than the rest of the house even though the windows were shut. According to Chastity's parents, they had put her to bed at around 9PM, gone to bed themselves roughly an hour and a half later, and then when they went in to get her up for church, she was just gone. Windows closed, still bolted shut from the inside. Bed unmade, but no signs of a struggle otherwise— her books were put away, desk pristine, even her plushies were still in a neat pile.

Detective work now is a lot different than it used to be; it had changed a shitload even before I retired. Nowadays police have the luxury of DNA databases, but the first conviction based on DNA wouldn't even happen until August of that year. Even still, I think that all the new technology we have now wouldn't have made much of a difference— we didn't find *anything* in that room. No hair, no fingerprints, no fluids, nothing. Not even from Chastity, even though when we picked through the rest of the house we found a few strands of her long, tawny hair. It was like her entire room had been cleaned, top to bottom, all while her parents slept peacefully in the room over. Nobody, not even Mullahy, had ever seen anything like it.

With no leads of any kind, we turned to the parents, but they seemed genuinely distraught about their daughter. Her mother, Lorna, didn't stop crying the entire time we searched her room, and her father, William, who had served in Vietnam, looked like he was back in a warzone. It was heart-wrenching, honestly. I'll never forget her mother's wails, or that faraway look in her father's eyes. But that's not the thing that's stuck with me about this case, not even close.

A search party was organized for the woods near the house within a couple of days, which I joined, figuring that since we weren't getting anywhere with forensics, I might as well try to help in another way. SPD ran the thing, providing officers and civilian volunteers alike flashlights and flares. We originally set off in pairs or groups, but the woods were so massive that eventually the group I was in, which was all fellow officers, split off, assured of our safety by our handguns.

I must've been out there for at least a few hours, yelling myself hoarse, when I heard it.

"Hello?"

The voice of a young girl, sounding like she was just a few meters away.

My heart leapt, and I quickly shined my flashlight in the direction of the voice. "Chastity? Hello?"

My light illuminated her, standing barefoot in her nightdress at the base of a tree. She didn't flinch away from the light, just stared at me with a blank expression. I fumbled with my flare gun, then decided making sure she was okay should take priority. I looked her over, trying to discern if she had any injuries, but she looked remarkably intact. *Too* intact.

No cuts or bruises that would come from getting what had to be at least a few miles into the woods, not even a scraped knee. Her hair was neatly braided, her nightdress unsullied by dirt or grime. It had been three days since she disappeared, and yet she looked like she had just woken up.

In hindsight, I should have been more perturbed by this. But I wasn't thinking like a detective, I was thinking like a man who had been hoping and praying that this young girl would be alright, and here she was, seemingly unharmed. It was like a miracle.

"I'm a police officer, I'm here to help. Are you alright, Chastity?" I crouched down, like I was approaching a scared animal. I hadn't been trained on this, it's not like SPD offered seminars on victim interaction and whatnot at the time, so I was just going with my gut.

"Yes, I'm fine," she said, still staring unblinkingly at the beam of my flashlight. I could see little flecks of brown in her green eyes. They looked glassy, almost glazed over, a little like her dad's had looked but... more artificial, somehow.

"Okay, well, let's get you home. Your mommy and daddy are very worried about you, I'm sure you want to see them, right?"

"Right," Chastity echoed. She still had that blank look on her face.

I inched closer to her. "Come here, sweetheart. I can carry you back, I don't want you to step on anything."

"Can I show you something?"

That caught me off guard. "Listen, Chastity, I need to get you to your parents, okay? You've been gone a while, they're very-"

"Won't take long," she cut me off, finally looking away from the flashlight to stare me in the eyes, "Please?"

I hesitated, suddenly wishing I had set off the flare as soon as I'd found her. This all felt *off*, the same feeling I had gotten when I went inside her room. It was like leaning a tad too far over a balcony railing, every instinct in your body screaming *DANGER, DANGER* in flashing red letters. I felt the urge, bizarrely, to turn around and flee.

"Not right now, Chastity," I said instead, "Why don't we go back to your mom and dad, okay? It's cold outside, aren't you cold?"

"No."

I huffed, shifting my weight. My back was starting to hurt from being in that crouch for so long. "Please? You can show me later, does that sound okay?"

"I said it won't take long," she whined, "Won't you please let me show you something, mister police officer?"

I straightened up. This was starting to get absurd. "I have to get you back to your parents, Chastity. I don't want you to hurt yourself out here."

Chastity's expression seemed to flicker, though I brushed it off as a trick of the light.

I stepped forward, and that's when I saw it. On her neck, only visible now that one of her braids had fallen to the side. It looked like a *seam*. It was neat, going right up the middle of her throat and disappearing into the neck of her dress. My breath caught in my throat and I instinctively moved my flashlight down to look closer at it.

"Mister police officer, can't I show you something?"

"No, I don't-" I stepped back, now. That feeling of panic had increased tenfold. Chastity mirrored me, taking a step closer. She had been still before, but once she shifted from that position I saw how unnatural and jerky her movements were; it reminded me of one of those old wind-up dolls.

"Please? It won't take long, promise." she insisted again, taking another step. Her voice sounded different, more desperate, but her expression still hadn't changed. Same blank, emotionless eyes, staring into my soul.

I didn't respond. My left hand hovered over the flare gun, then over my actual gun. There was no rational thought behind my actions, just pure, unadulterated *fear*.

Have you ever realized something, as it was staring you in the face, plain as day? And you think to yourself, *how could I have missed that*? They warn you, in law enforcement training, to never let your guard down. Personally, I think it's human of us— that tendency to overlook the most obvious things. Even if it's so often the thing that gets you killed.

But in that moment, something clicked. That yearbook photo flashed in my mind, an image I'd seen a thousand times over, yet never *really* looked at. Tawny braids, smile full of braces... and a pair of kind, sky-blue eyes.

I was too shocked to conceal my surprise; I'm sure it was painted all over my face. Because suddenly, that girl— that *thing*— lunged towards me, and my fight-or-flight instinct took over. I turned and ran, hoping it was in the direction I came from but not really caring where I was going, as long as it was *away*.

I know it's absurd. I had a gun, for fuck's sake, and this was a 65 pound, 4'5" little girl, nevermind one that *I* was supposed to be rescuing. But it was like no fear I've ever felt before or since. I was certain those moments were going to be my last.

I kept running for as long as I could, and I could hear her behind me. The rapid crunch of leaves and twigs under her feet spurred me on as I sprinted, distantly thankful for all the cardio I had done. Yet, she was somehow keeping up with me— I didn't turn around to visually confirm, but it sounded like she was right on my tail.

I was beginning to lose stamina when I saw my saving grace: the end of the woods, marked by a neat row of houses, one of which I knew belonged to the Cane family. I used my last bit of strength to speed up and make it out, nearly barreling into the back of one of the houses.

When I finally got outside the woods, my heart was pounding so fast I thought I must be dying. I finally looked behind me, but nothing emerged from the dense woodland. The sounds of snapping branches had stopped; the only thing I could hear was the blood rushing in my ears and my own ragged breathing. I found my way back to my car, drove home, and went to bed, fully operating on autopilot. I didn't know what to do, what to think.

The search continued for a couple of weeks until it tapered off. I didn't go back, endured the taunts from my fellow officers about chickening out of going into the woods. The case went cold, the news cycle shifted. On the anniversaries of her disappearance, her parents would send letters to the police department, make public appeals, hold press conferences on whatever local news station would host them. I think they kept doing it up until William died, but I transferred to New York in '92 and only heard about it when Mullahy and I caught up every few years. They never found a body. To this day, the case is still open.

You might be wondering why I'm telling this story after all these years of silence. Well, my daughter sent me a news article yesterday about a strange sighting in Seattle. She sends me these things from time to time; she's very into true crime, always wanting to hear stories from my days as a detective. I never told her this one, though. I've never told *anyone* this one. In truth, I was planning to take it to my grave— but I feel like I have a duty to spread the word.

Because that article was about a couple of college kids, camping out in the forest. One of them ran across a young girl who kept asking to show him something. When he alerted his friends and instead offered to call her parents, she ran away. They gave chase, but eventually lost her.

The kid managed to snap a picture of her while they were talking, in hopes that someone would recognize her. And as it turned out, I was that someone. Because the girl in the photo had neatly braided tawny hair, a mouth full of metal braces, a clean, pale yellow nightgown, and sparkling green eyes.

It was unmistakably the same girl I had seen in those woods, looking like she had stepped right out of 1987. But it wasn't Chastity Cane. She's gone, but someone— some*thing*— is still there. Watching. Waiting.

So if you decide to go camping in the Seattle woods and you run into her, especially if you're alone, don't follow her. Run.
