The mountain was never supposed to lock Mark inside.



The weather was worse than we thought.



It wasn’t supposed to snow that day, but a blizzard hit us.



We were halfway up the mountain, and the cabin was not far enough from the ridge.



“Mark, I don't think we can get over King’s Ridge. The blizzard is too strong.” 



“We can’t just wait and sit around in this weather. It’s alright, John, I’ll go first. Hold onto the straps.”



“Mark, I really don’t think so…”



“Just hold on!”



He screamed in my face.



I tried to yell at him to stop; we could barely see a few feet in front of us.



But Mark wouldn’t listen anymore; his mind was made up.



I rested my body against the mountain and grabbed the harness of my rope.



My heart was beating hard in my chest.



Mark started walking on the ridge, holding onto the rocks, his bag bumping behind his body.



Less than a minute passed, and I couldn’t see him anymore.



Then a scream. The rope started pulling so hard that I was scared the hook would come out of the rock.



Somehow, I managed to stay on my feet.



“Are you okay, Mark?!” I screamed down to him.



“Yeah, I’m good,” he said in a calm voice.



“Can you climb up?”



Soon, he emerged from beneath the ridge, laughing.



“It’s getting bad. Let's turn around.”



“We’re so close. Let’s just wait for like 20 minutes, maybe it will pass.”



“What if it gets worse, then we won’t even be able to get back!”



“Twenty minutes.” Mark didn’t even wait for my answer and passed by me to hide in a cave nearby.



I tried to bargain with him, but he wouldn’t budge. 



I sat in the cave next to him, anxiously staring out of the entrance, praying the blizzard wouldn’t get worse.



There was a strange drawing on the wall of the cave, a square with two lines extending from it, crossing each other.



But like magic, the snow slowly subsided. The sky opened up, and a warm sun came from behind the clouds.



“See? What did I tell you?” Mark said and walked out.



I was still a little wary, but this was our best chance to make it up to the cabin.



We strapped the carabiners, and Mark walked over, this time without an issue. I slowly followed.



The rest of the climb was moderate. The cabin was just around the corner.



Then the blizzard came back.



Hail was hitting my face.



I screamed at Mark to speed up and get to the cabin as soon as possible.



Everything slowly turned white.



Then Mark’s voice screamed through the wind, “John, the cabin’s here!”



Prayer flags were hung all around it.



I was surprised that these were the first flags we saw.



There were many of them on the other mountains, and this one was supposed to be the holiest.



“Hey John!” Mark screamed again.



I snapped out of it. He was pointing at the door. 



There was a lock on it.



How was that possible? This should have been opened for everyone.



But there was no time to think.



Mark pulled a knife from his backpack and started pounding on the lock.



One, two, three hits.



The lock broke.



He quickly opened the door, and we both stumbled in.



Candles were lit around the cabin.



Prayer flags hung around the ceiling.



“Hi, is anyone in here?” Mark shouted.



No answer.



Mark looked back and shrugged.



A chill ran down my spine.



Mark pulled out his flashlight and climbed up the ladder to the sleeping area.



“There’s some weird symbol on the wall.”



I walked back to take a closer look.



It was a square with two lines extending from it, crossing each other.



It was the one from the cave.



“Yo, the candles are in the same shape as the thing on the wall.”



Then, strange singing started coming up from the floor beneath us.



It was in a language I couldn’t understand.



The singing was loud and throaty with a strange raspiness.



We looked at each other in bewilderment.



Then the symbol on the wall began glowing in a bright white light.



It shone right into Mark’s face.



His eyes then slowly widened and rolled up back into his head.



He fell to the floor.



“Mark!” I screamed out and ran to him.



His body started shivering and foaming at the mouth.



A seizure?



Mark didn’t have epilepsy.



I got on my knees, rolled his body to the side, and put a bag under his head.



He started seizing more.



I frantically got our backpacks and started searching for the first-aid kit, knowing there wasn’t anything to help him.



The trapdoor opened.



People with long dark hair, beards, and clothing with strange necklaces began crawling out of it.



They looked around the room and down at Mark.



One of them pointed at his hand.



He had an open wound on it.



They started arguing among themselves.



Another one of them, a man with a larger set of necklaces and tattoos on his face, pointed at the symbol.



I tried to tell them again that I needed to help my friend, but they wouldn’t listen. I could see genuine anger in their faces.



They began screaming, pulled out knives, and began coming closer to us.



Shock ran down my spine.



Then Mark’s body sat upright. His eyes were still rolled back.



He began roaring at the people, his voice deep and rusty.



They stopped, got on their knees, and started bowing down to him.



The roaring began getting louder until my ears started ringing.



Mark then stood up, looking among the men.



He pointed at one of them and outstretched his hand, motioning it upwards.



As he did so, the man’s body began levitating, floating in the air.



The man wore a smile of contempt and happiness.



Then Mark clenched his fist, and the man’s head slowly caved in on itself and exploded, his brain splattered all over the room.



My legs started shaking, and I let out a gasp.



The other men were still bowed on the ground, with no reaction to what had happened to their companion.



I started slowly backing away, trying to reach the door, but as my hand touched the handle, Mark quickly turned away.



He now pointed in my direction, started roaring, and outstretched his hand.



My body then began levitating in the air.



It was getting harder to breathe.



“Mark…Mark…st…op.”



He then started slowly clenching his fist, and immense painful pressure formed in my head; my ears started popping.



My world started turning black. I tried to call his name again.



Then his eyes rolled back.



My body fell to the ground.



“Wha…What’s going on?”



“Mark, Mark!”



“John…?”



The men started singing again.



Mark’s body began shivering.



He fell to his knees and let out an agonizing scream, his eyes rolled right back into his head.



I didn’t wait around this time and opened the door and stumbled outside of the cabin into the blizzard.



My heart was beating out of my chest.



I ran as fast as I could, not looking back.



The roars echoed through the wind.



The hail was hitting my face.



The wind felt so cold on my skin.



I reached King’s Ridge. The roar was getting closer.



I crossed swiftly, not caring if I fell.



Halfway across, I saw an outline of a human next to me.



My body froze with fear.



Then the silhouette slipped, and a scream echoed through the mountain.



First sounding like the roar, but then slowly turning to Mark.



I managed to cross the ridge and hid in the cave next to it, shivering.



Two other explorers found me after the blizzard subsided and called the mountain service.



I was becoming hypothermic, but managed to survive.



The mountain service explored the mountains. There were the bodies of the three men in the cabin with their heads exploded.



They never found Mark’s body.



I’m sitting in a hotel room now, awaiting the interrogation tomorrow.

The walls are thin here.

I can hear someone singing next door.

*I think it’s Mark.*
