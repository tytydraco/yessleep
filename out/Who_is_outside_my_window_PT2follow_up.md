For starters, I just want to thank you all for the advice you’ve given. I’ve never believed in the paranormal or anything like that, so all of this is completely new to me. Of course, I’ve seen horror movies and stuff, but never thought it was real. Even now, I just can’t wrap my mind around it. Anyway, I’ve had a few major updates.

One, me and my dad did talk. He just lectured me about how I shouldn’t be saying this stuff, how my mom was gone and wasn't coming back. My family isn’t religious, and my dad doesn’t believe in the supernatural. He thinks I’m lying and is considering getting me a therapist. Something about coping? Idk The conversation went something like this:

“Emma, listen. I understand that it’s hard for you, with everything that’s happened. But you can’t say things like this, making up stories,” he was stern with his tone.

“I’m not lying to you. I swear, something is going on- “

“That’s enough! Emma, nothing is going on. Your mother disappeared years ago, she is gone," he was choking up on his words, "Maybe Lindsey was right…”

“Right about what?” At this point, I felt like crying.

“Therapy. She’s started talking to someone, it’s been helpful for her,” he explained a little more, but I won’t share all those details.

“I don’t need therapy! Dad, please, I swear something is going on,” I don’t remember when, but I started crying.

“Listen, sweetheart,” he sighed, “let’s just get you someone to talk to alright? That might help,” he rubbed his hands over his face.

“I don’t need anyone; I don’t need help. I need you to listen to me.”

“That’s it. I don’t want to hear about it anymore,” and just like that, the conversation was over. I didn’t miss how he took more steps outside to smoke. I also didn’t miss the heavier eye bags the next morning, but I chose not to comment on it.

Secondly, things have only gotten worse. For a while, it was just whispering and humming outside my window. I was able to ignore it for the most part, but then it started screaming. I'm not talking about an annoying, childlike scream. No, I’m talking about painful, gut-wrenching screaming. Do you know what a bobcat or mountain lion sounds like? It’s scary as shit. For those that don’t, think of those scary screams people use for those trashy clickbait “look what we heard in the woods at 3 AM” videos. But this is on an entirely new level. It sounds like someone being murdered, tortured, the whole works. I don’t know how else to describe it, or how terrifying it was. 

It woke up me at about 2:30? I remember falling asleep, I could hear my dad in the living room. When I woke up, I could just feel something was wrong. I don't believe in a 6th sense or anything (or I didn't, not sure what I believe now), but the idea of your mind knowing when you're not alone seems to be very real now. I just knew something was wrong. I didn't hear the humming or tapping, but I could feel it was outside. Then it screamed. My eyes snapped open, and my body froze. The noise shook me to my core, I didn't dare breathe. It only happened once, just one long gut-wrenching scream. And then it was silent. There was no humming, no tapping, no screaming, nothing. I was awake and frozen for the rest of the night. 

That happened four nights ago? It happened again the next two nights as well, but it wasn't just one scream. For the next nights, it was on and off screaming for hours. I tried to sleep, but when it sounds like someone is screaming in your ear, it's hard.  The scariest thing is, nobody but me hears it. Henry seems to be sleeping fine, and I haven’t told my dad. Not after his lecture. 

I think my health is going downhill. I haven't slept much in the past week; I'm kept up and plagued by this horrid noise. I also haven't been eating much. I started skipping breakfast, would maybe eat lunch, and I'd just pick at my dinner. I'm exhausted and hungry, but I can't bring myself to take care of myself. I feel like I'm going crazy, my mental health has also gone downhill. Maybe a therapist wasn't a bad idea? I've thought about it, but what would I even tell them? "Oh yeah, my mom who disappeared years ago is tormenting me in the middle of the night but it's just me nobody else knows." I would no doubt be put in some kind of psych ward. 

Thirdly, and what I’m here to post about, is the break-in.

Yesterday, someone broke into our house. I was at school when I was called up to the principal's office. My dad was on the phone, saying that when we got home from school, we would need to be careful. Cops were around the house and didn’t want me or Henry getting in the way. 

"Cops? Why are cops around?"

"Someone broke in, the house is a wreck," I could hear the strain in his voice. 

"Oh shit," the Principe shot me a glare as I swore. I didn't care; she was a bitch anyways. 

The break-in was weird. My bedroom window was shattered, and cops determined the point of entry (I know, big shock).  The house was a mess, everything was torn to shreds. Bookshelves were knocked over, the TV was lying down flat, kitchen cabinets were open, the whole works. My room was practically destroyed. There was glass everywhere, my sheets were torn, my closet doors were ripped off its hinges, etc. The rest of the house was wrecked, but nothing compared to the state of my room. 

But nothing of value was taken. No money, no personal identification stuff (like passports and birth certificates). I still had all my more expensive stuff, Henry’s Xbox and PlayStation weren’t touched; my dad still had his nice watches. The police noted this, making some statements that it was odd. But what was taken was old memory stuff. The family scrapbooks under my bed, Lindsey’s old diary from middle school, and family photos that hung on walls and sat on bookshelves. All sorts of older memories from our past. It was mostly stuff from the old house, things before my mom disappeared. But there were a few newer pictures that we noted were missing. I'm not sure how much any of that matters, but it's just so strange. 

We had a large picture that hung in our hallway. It was an older picture, I think I was 8 when it was taken? It had me, my dad and mom, Lindsey, and a baby Henry. The picture used to hang above the mantle in our old house, my mother loved the picture. She always talked about how it was her favorite family photo, we all looked happy. The picture was lying face down, pretty sure it was ripped off the wall (the nail that held it up was found lying on the ground as well). The glass was shattered, and the picture itself was ripped up. It was the only whole family photo that wasn't taken. 

Last night we stayed in a hotel. My dad didn’t feel safe staying in the house and just got us the cheapest and closest thing. Not to mention, my window was broken. He had already called someone about getting it fixed, but a part of me didn't want to go back. I was able to sleep last night, which is nice. I feel a little better, now that I’ve slept a decent bit. It’s amazing what some good sleep will do for you. We are still trying to figure out exactly what happened, the cops are a little confused on why nothing of value was taken. They've asked if we knew anyone who would want to do this and if anyone had a stalker. 

Honestly, I'm not sure where to go now. We should be able to get back into the house late tonight or early tomorrow. Still unsure of when the window in my room will be fixed. A part of me doesn't want to go back, I want at least one more night of good sleep. I haven't spoken to my dad at all, he's been so busy dealing with everything going on. Henry seems to be unnerved, but I suppose that's to be expected. We called Lindsey, she's going to come home this upcoming weekend for a small visit.

 I'm not sure where or how to end this post. I'm just updating everyone on what's going on, it's been so weird. Although I'm getting more sleep, my paranoia is still through the roof. I can't help but feel scared and I have this feeling of impending doom (or at least I think that's what it is). If anyone has any suggestions or theories, please help me.
