I don’t know where else to put this. I’ve tried to talk about it professionally, but every time I bring it up, the conversation dies fast. People either change the subject or give me that look, the one that says you’re crazy or lying. So I’m posting this anonymously. I’ve removed identifying details. Names, locations, and will not show any pictures. What matters is that the case itself is real, the evidence exists, and I have seen it with my own eyes.

Part 1

I’ve been in law enforcement for a little over six years. I started as a patrol officer in a small town. Night shifts. Domestic disturbances. Drug calls out in the woods. The usual slow grind that wears you down piece by piece. My last night on patrol, I nearly got stuck by a used needle while restraining tweaker. Missed it by inches. That was enough for me. I still believed in the work, but I needed distance from the chaos. I went back to school. Studied forensics. Took every course I could afford. Eventually, I was hired as a detective by the same county, just assigned to a different town. It was small enough that they only needed one detective. Anything major got kicked up to a neighboring jurisdiction. My first month was slow. Mostly administrative cleanup. The previous detective was retiring after decades on the job, and my supervisor wanted the office reorganized, files purged, cabinets cleared. I came across a folder that caught my eye a faded manila folder tucked behind tax records from the 1970s.

CLOSED UNEXPLAINED MURDER SUICIDE 1976

I asked the retiring detective if it was trash. He stared at the folder longer than necessary before saying, “Probably best to throw it out. That case was closed before I got here.”

He muttered, “It didn’t make sense to me. Didn’t make sense to the guy before me either.”

He said I could read it if I wanted but Ignorance was bliss. Pretty shitty thing for a detective to say but the old timer was right this case should’ve stayed closed.

Part 2

Inside the file were crime scene photographs, coroner reports, and photocopies of handwritten journal pages. Some were out of order. The original journal was no longer in the evidence room.

November 19, 1975 “Marsha delivered our baby girl two days ago. I’m not sleeping much, but I’ve never been more grateful for it. I’ve been home helping with diapers and cooking. Josh approved the time off, he’s a good friend. The lack of sleep is getting to me. I keep drifting, but Marsha needs me. She looks angelic when she sleeps, even as exhausted as the pregnancy left her. The baby just closed her eyes. I need to take advantage of this and rest.”

The next entry feels like it was written by a different person. Same handwriting. Same pencil. But the pressure is almost gone, like the writer couldn’t bring himself to press down. No date. Based on context, investigators believed it was written November 23rd.

“I didn’t mean to. I didn’t. I didn’t do this. I can’t be the one to blame. I need to call the police but I don’t know what they’ll do to me. I can’t face her parents. Her brother. Her…”

The writing trails off. Blood is smeared across the page, dragged from left to right. The stain pattern indicates the writer’s hand was bleeding and resting near the paper as they wrote.

“She did this. I didn’t want it to happen. She shouldn’t have changed. We were doing so good an hour ago. She’s still here. Alive. I know she’ll wake up. She’s just tired. I can tell the police she tripped. But the bruise on her arm. This isn’t fair. This isn’t real. I’ll wait. She’ll wake up. Admit it was an accident. Breastfeed the baby so it stops crying.”

Part 3

The next entries are steadier. Not calmer, just functional. I’ve paraphrased some scratched out words for clarity.

November 26, 1975 “Everyone who knocked eventually left. The mail piled up. It’s been three days since she died. Last night I moved her body outside. I waited until the neighbors’ lights went out and dug her a grave. I don’t want to hide her. But it’s not right for her to decay on the floor. I cleaned the blood too. I’m not hiding evidence. She wanted the mess cleaned. I’m taking care of the baby. She’s getting weak but I waited too long to call it in. It took me hours to get pull my weeping face from her cold chest. The baby screaming snapped me out of it and gave me some strength to go on. My stomach feels like it’s full of ice. I need to function for the baby. She’s all I have left.”

Final Entry

November 27, 1975 “She’s still in the backyard and my hope is gone. The baby passed away from malnutrition. I did everything I could. She passed in her sleep. She didn’t cry. She didn’t tell me I was doing something wrong. She’s with her mother now. I can’t face anyone after this.

God may forgive me. So I can be with them. Mom. Dad. Sharon. Bill. Josh, please forgive me. I’m done feeling this pain I love you all.”

Part 4

According to the file, the subject’s employer contacted police on December 20th after he failed to return from approved leave and stopped responding to calls. Officers conducted a welfare check.

The wife was located seated upright on the living room couch. No visible signs of decomposition. No insect activity. No odor consistent with a body deceased for weeks. Her limbs were fixed in rigor mortis. Blood pooled beneath her feet. Jaw slack. Eyes closed. The abdomen was severely distended, medically abnormal. The coroner estimated her time of death as early December. During examination, her clothing was cut away. Her abdomen had been crudely stitched closed. When the sutures were opened, the infant fell free. Advanced decomposition. The coroner documented that the infant had died in late November, consistent with the date recorded in the journal. The husband was found in the bedroom closet. He was hanging. Coroner estimates placed his time of death on or around November 27th.

During follow up interviews, detectives spoke with coworkers, friends, and family members. Every single one confirmed the same thing. The husband was right handed. Not ambidextrous. No history of left handed writing. No injuries that would have forced him to switch hands. The blood smear patterns on the journal pages indicate the writer was left handed. The handwriting analysis confirmed consistency across all entries.

Addendum Document from Case File

Document Type: Property and Utilities Review Prepared By: County Investigations Division Date Logged: January 4, 1976 Status: Filed Without Action

During post closure review, investigators requested supplemental records to verify residence activity following the estimated dates of death. The following items were obtained and added to evidence. Utility Records Summary Electric and water usage at the residence remained consistent with normal occupancy levels from November 28th through December 18th.

Water usage showed daily spikes between 0200 and 0400 hours, consistent with bathing or laundering.

Electric usage indicated repeated activation of kitchen appliances during the same period. No forced entry was observed at any point. No neighbors reported seeing anyone enter or leave the residence after November 27th.

Supplemental Physical Evidence During secondary processing of the kitchen area, investigators recovered the following: One feeding bottle located in the sink Bottle interior tested positive for human milk residue

Residue freshness was inconsistent with the documented date of infant death. The bottle showed no visible mold, cracking, or odor consistent with prolonged stagnation.

Fingerprint recovery from the bottle produced one partial print. The print did not match the husband. The print did not match the wife. The print did not match any responding officer, coroner, or known associate. Due to database limitations at the time, no further comparison was possible.

Closing Note No additional evidence was located. No evidence recovered in trash. No suspects were identified. No explanation was recorded for continued utility usage, food preparation indicators, or postmortem infant feeding residue. The case remained classified as a closed unexplained murder suicide.

That document was the last thing in the file.
