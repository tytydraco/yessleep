I’ve always had awful vision. My parents were both so kind to bless me with a combination of their health issues. Chief among them is the glaucoma that has affected me since- just about forever. My right eye lost all vision as a result of a failed surgery I underwent when I was young, leaving me severely affected.

Eye drops and coke-bottle glasses were my closest friends for a majority of my informative years. We all know middle and high school children are notoriously kind to peers with thick glasses. Though I suppose that’s neither here nor there.

Honestly, since it’s affected me since birth, I’ve never really noticed it. It’s just how things are, and your brain can get used to some crazy stuff. Did you know you can always see your nose? Your brain just filters it out? Well now, you do.

I don’t know what normal vision looks like, so to me, my vision is normal. I’m older now though, dancing around my thirties and the decline in visual acuity is getting to the point where I notice it, when thinking about it. These things happen with age, though, and you just must accept them. Stressing out won’t fix the problem. On the contrary, many issues are exacerbated by stress.

Everything was fine, honestly. I can wear contacts and function fine outdoors; my quality of life is well enough. Until my visit to the optometrist last month, that is. It was just a routine checkup, nothing out of the ordinary. The pressures in my eyes were stable. At the end, he asked me if I was seeing any “Floaters”. To which I replied, I wasn’t.

I’m unfortunately the type to hyper-fixate on things. So, upon getting home, his question bounced around in my head. I would get floaters now and then, but they would typically vanish over time. Or I had assumed they went away. Like I said, your brain can get used to some crazy stuff. So, I got to wondering if I actually did have floaters. I guess I should explain what floaters are, huh? Not everyone has to deal with them. They are more common to experience as you get older.

In the back of your eye is a gel-like substance. I know, yummy, right? In this substance, there are strands of protein. These strands can come loose and clump together. When the light hits these strands, you’ll notice a disturbance in your vision. I’m not an optometrist, obviously, but that’s about the gist of it.

These “Floaters” can appear as black, gray, or translucent obstructions in your vision, and while they aren’t inherently harmful. They are obnoxious, to be sure. Though if you’re reading this and have had a sudden onslaught of floaters and flashes of light, make an appointment with your eye doctor, it could be a sign of a detaching retina. Just an FYI.

So, I got to thinking about these little specks. And I wondered if maybe I had some, but I had just gotten used to them. It was a fairly bright day out, and I had some outside… assistance in mellowing my brain out. And with my thoughts racing about the concept of floaters, I noticed it. Right in the center of my vision, a small floating strand. It looked like I had stared at a light for too long, that multi-colored after-image you get.

At the moment, upon first noticing this ocular intruder, I spiraled. Possibly spurred on by the cannabis in my lungs. I thought, “Well, this is it. Here goes what little vision I have left.” For the rest of the day, anxiety plagued me, and ended up scrolling through blog after blog. Learning everything I can.

Eventually, I found solace in the forums I read. Groups of people conversing with each other, griping about floaters and giving hope to each other. The main takeaway about floaters is that you can just… ignore them. Despite their intrusiveness, there is no real threat posed, and you can start to filter them out subconsciously.

This relief carried me for a while, and I’ve got to say it did work. The annoying little friend in the middle of my vision became less and less of a problem and I’d hardly notice it at all some days. It was always there though and if I went looking for it, I could find it, and the cycle would repeat.

During one of these cycles, I had realized that it had gotten bigger. I thought maybe my mind was playing tricks on me, but no, it was definitely taking up more of my FOV than it had previously done. Looking at my phone, the intrusive colors obscured greater sections of the screen.

I made another appointment, and the doctor informed me that I would simply have to live with it, as treatments are still fairly new and they only use them for severe cases in people older than me. So, I did my best to just deal with it. Tried to keep my mind from wandering into thoughts of my little translucent friend. But with it having grown, it was harder to do.

My job required me to read a lot of projects, notes and plan-o-grams, so I’d often be starting at small black text on white pieces of paper. It became almost impossible to ignore, and I fell down a depressive hole. Hardly leaving the house, keeping all the lights off inside. My hobbies, my job, and my life started to crumble. And I’m not alone in this experience. If you think I’m overreacting, many people have dealt with this same cycle.

It’s lonely and destructive and unfortunately, your brain can get used to anything, even if it’s killing you. I remember sitting in my room, staring at the white walls. My light was on, which it rarely was. Just sitting there, I watched the shape of my floater dancing in my vision, staring at it, as if my hatred for it might burn the obstruction away.

Never have I ever been so intimately aware of the shape it took. What was at first nothing more than a thin thread of blotchy colors had transformed into what looked like a mess of see-through yarn. Somewhere in the back of my mind danced intrusive thoughts. That I could just pluck my eye out. Get ahead of the disaster and deal with the consequences.

This thought became fairly present when I noticed that in the middle of this barely perceptible clump was a speck of black. This was something I was fearing from the start. The translucent floaters are one thing. The darker ones, though, almost demand your attention. My teeth gritted and I could feel the anxiety setting in. The racing heart and pounding mind. I cursed my DNA and all its faults.

I watched that speck for so long, focused so hard on it I don’t remember falling asleep, only that it was dark out when I woke up. I stirred in bed, ruffling my blankets, feeling about as groggy as you’d expect. The light was still on, so of course when my eyes pried open, the floater was there, shifting shapes in my sight.

I’m not sure how floaters look to everyone, but the way it moved, how some threads would reach out and retract. It looked alive. The dark spot in the middle had either gotten bigger or I just remembered it being smaller. There was another one too, hanging right next to it, two small black dots hovering in the center of my vision. It was enough to make me go insane.

If it wasn’t for the heavy workload I had received that week, I might’ve just stayed indoors every day. Even with such deteriorated vision, though, I couldn’t afford to just not work, so I threw on some sunglasses and did the best I could. It wasn’t easy, but the workload did at least distract me for brief periods of time.

My mind tried its hardest to filter out the floater, but whenever a word passed by just right, or light crept around the rims of my glasses, I would see it. My heart would sink every time I’d over analyze it, trying to see what might have changed. If it had grown or shrunk, if it drifted to the sides. Then I’d go home and stare at the wall again. I could feel myself, body in mind decaying, but I couldn’t stop.

After about a week of this routine, I was at my wits’ end. With the project complete, I had earned a day off from work. I did not spend this day stress-free. After my shower, I looked in the mirror. Trying so hard to see past the floater that had grown and shifted. A mangled mess of yarn jumbled around those two dark orbs that refused to yield.

I couldn’t see myself. My eyes were replaced with the small dots, the surrounding cobwebs obscuring all my features. The floaters, the translucent ones, were so avoidable. They hard-darkened in hue, making sure their presence was known. It was taking shape in front of me the whole time, and I couldn’t do anything about it.

I saw a web expand and tighten, stretching all the way to the edges of what I could see. I… felt it. I could feel it when the floater stiffened up like it had tugged at one of my nerves. There was a sudden underlying pain in my arm as if it was cramping up. I let out a few gasps as I tried to will my fingers, trying to release my arm from what felt like an intense cramp.

Eventually, the floater’s tendrils drifted back into the fold and the pain in my arm dissipated. I looked into the mirror in awe, stared at the “face” of the floater, and wondered if it had caused the pain. The thought was absurd, but I was about ready to blame the intruder for anything negative in my life.

The thought of that alone was enough to make me back down from the trance the mirror held on me. I resolved to call the optometrist in the more and grabbed a bottle of sleeping pills. Stepping through the house, I turned one light on after the other as I fiddled with the pills in my head. Reaching my bedroom, I counted the medication and turned the bedside lamp on.

With the lamp springing to life, it suddenly occurred to me what I had just done. Turning around to face the rest of my bedroom, I could see how bright everything was. Why in the world had I turned everything on? The floater was so incredibly visible on the white wall that it felt like it was in the room with me. Like a mouse that caught the ire of a house cat, I could feel myself shrinking. Nothing more than prey.

I felt myself backing away from it like I was expecting it to lung out at me. The shape shifted against the wall. God, it was taking up so much of my visual real estate. Due to the brightness of the room, I could discern details of the individual threads that constituted the mass. I could see how they dropped lower than I thought and seemed to fan out.

Look, I know how this sounds, but they were like shoulders. It started to look more and more like the shadow of a man. A shadow made of threads; short pieces of see-through yarn wriggling around, intangible worms. The more I looked, the sharper the image got, the less I could see what was behind it.

The room was so damn bright that when I closed my eyes, there was enough light resting on my eyelids that I could still see it! It was even worse in the dark that shut eyes afforded. Just this spectral being looming off in the darkness staring back at me. As it shifted, I could see its “head” bobbing from side to side like it was curiously observing me. Like I was some zoo animal!

I couldn’t keep my eyes open; I couldn’t shut them. My body refused to budge when I commanded it, as if it was a stranger’s body. My mind was just floating there, drifting through the experience. Those threads in my eyes, would reach to the side of my vision, over and over. Each time they reached, they got stiff, no longer appearing to be floating freely like they had latched on to something. There would be a brief and sharp pain somewhere on my body, and the tendrils would retreat into the mass.

Eventually, I found I was moving around the house. What little I could see of it, anyway. There would only be brief snippets of what was beyond the floater. I don’t know if the bits of protein were getting darker or if there were just more, and they layered over each other, but the strands started to become a dark gray.

The eyes- god see, I’m calling them eyes, the little black dots I mean. They never changed, stayed just as small, hanging side by side in the middle of the mass. There was no reason behind where I was in the house. I’d just be in the bathroom, then in the kitchen. Like an aimless child, my body waddled around.

I’d pick up various objects and just look at them, turning them over and soaking in every detail. There was a point where I could see that I was just looking at my hands. Like I was in awe of how they articulated, and I wanted to study the movements of my digits. The mass of floaters in my eyes may have looked like some far-off observer, but I felt like one.

It wasn’t my body anymore; I wasn’t deciding. I started to ask myself just how close my optic nerves were to my brain. I asked myself just where those floaters were reaching to and what they were grabbing. My mind started to drift away. I felt as though I was in stasis. I’ve never been in a sensory deprivation tank, but I have to assume it feels similar.

No agency. Whether my eyes were open or closed, all I could see was the tangled mess blocking my vision, staring back at me. No rhyme or reason behind it. I’m not sure even if it knows what it’s doing. All I knew was that if I was going to do something, I was rapidly losing the time to do it. Before I couldn’t move a muscle, I decided it was still my body.

I’m truly sorry, but I’m sure you already know what I had to do.

I didn’t want to, obviously.

But I felt so far away, so lost in fog, it was all I could think of.

With one desperate surge of strength brought on by desperation and adrenaline, I quickly lifted my hand. The floater flailed around wildly; it was in my head and knew what I was doing. Tendrils quickly reached to the side of my vision, but I was faster. My middle and pointer fingers pressed on the top. My thumb was on the bottom, and I pushed.

There was no time to think or hesitate. All I had was momentum, and I couldn’t afford to lose it. I thought it would be harder; I had heard that our bodies subconsciously try to stop us from doing harm to ourselves. My fingers met no such subconscious resistance. No resistance of any kind.

As the floater wriggled away, I pressed on. I could see it the whole time, an angry gray shadow trying to fight back. Its tendrils reached, grabbed, and pulled. I felt it; the pain ringing out all over, like razors dragging underneath my skin, trying to cut a way out. It was all nauseating. I only kept going, as I had no other choice.

The white orb in my socket squished under the weight of my fingers. The tension underneath the film reminded me of grapes and bubbles. I wasn’t sure exactly how to do it. Whether I should try to pull it out or crush it completely. Though in my frantic state, heart racing so hard it was any wonder it didn’t explode, that I did a touch of both.

Reaching back as far as I could, I felt a

 

\*pop\*

 

And could feel a new surge of warm liquid coating my fingertips. My throat retched and my chest heaved with the knowledge of what I had just done. My fingers twisted like a blender in the socket that was quickly becoming vacant. I tugged and pulled at whatever bits of connecting tissue I could get them to clasp. It was like a volcano had erupted in my skull.

The pain was hottest in the eye socket, of course, but it radiated like rolling magma, enough to nearly make a pass out. And suddenly, half of my vision was gone. I stood for a moment, feeling the warmth rush down the left side of my cheek. It carried some sort of frothy clump with it. What that was, though, I could not tell you.

With my arm dropping to the side, I stood. Feeling like I was nowhere at all. I was able to turn my head again. Wriggle my fingers and even swallowed some of the vomit that was trying to escape my throat. I had always wondered what it was like to be completely blind.

I think the first thing people think is that it’s complete darkness. That's wrong though, it's not darkness because they’re no darkness to take in. You just see nothing. I can’t… I don’t have the words. It’s like… think about your vision now. Try to think about your peripherals. Think about the edge of your vision. What do you see beyond that? No darkness, you don’t see anything. That’s what it’s like.

 

“A stress-induced hysteric episode.” That is how it was described to my friends and family. That’s how they explained why I was brought to the ER with my only remaining good eye, mangled like a chew toy. I was under observation for quite some time. Not really sure how many days. It’s easy for me to lose track.

Things were normal. Well, despite the events that brought me there, I was almost at peace in the facility. I was learning how to navigate the world without sight. Normally, I’d have been terrified of going completely blind. But I felt almost relieved. Knowing I’d never have to see those floaters again.

And I was right. I’ll never see them again. I can see them. But that doesn’t mean they’re not there. That doesn’t mean I can’t feel them tickling the inside of my skull. A scratch that I could never reach, all day, every goddamn day. Thank God for Speech-to-text software, right? Thank God, I can tell you all about this misery.  
Do you know what it’s like to feel watched? To always feel watched. To not be able to see your observer. The way my skin never stops crawling. The way parts of my body will flare up with white-hot pain like it was punishing me for fighting back. It just keeps getting worse. I’m starting to just show up in random rooms again, holding random objects. Looking down at them.

Like the floater is mocking me. Like it can see still, but I can’t and it wants me to know that I lost. The worst part. The absolute final dagger in this rotting corpse of me. Is that somehow. Some inexplicable way. Even in all the nothing that I can see. In the complete void of sensory information, I have. I can still see those two little black dots. I can still see them staring at me.

And that’s all I can see.

All I’ll ever see.

Two little pinpricks of unrelenting darkness
