This happened to my buddies and I way back in the twelfth grade. We'd all scrounged for a year to make a trip out of our final spring break. Our group was the type to favor woods over beaches, so we convinced our parents to let us drive down to Kentucky for a week.

The rental didn't have logs or a chimney, but we spent the ride down planning our great wilderness adventure and we refused to call it anything except a cabin. We arrive in three cars and settle like dust. The sun sets while we take turns jumping off the dock, enjoying the moderately sized lake to ourselves.

When dusk withers, I hurry up the beach to start a fire. The eight of us huddle around it. Wrapped in towels, we roast hotdogs and share scary stories. We're probably too old to really frighten each other anymore but it was a tradition of ours.

Two of the girls leave to go down by the dock. They weren’t in the mood for ghost stories, but five minutes later they’re hauling ass up the hill, babbling about something in the lake. We all go down as a group, while the girls organize their words.

Something big was moving in the water, Lexi said. We illuminate the lake with our flashlights but the water is smooth. One of the girls points out a dim orange hue in the woods beyond the opposite shore. We can tell from where we're standing that it’s a fire. It wouldn’t be a problem if not for two reasons: firstly being, there are no other cabins on the lake, and second, camping is illegal in the area.

We all know this and agree that we'd stop by the police station in town tomorrow. Some people start saying they want to go back to the cabin. They turn their backs to the insisting glow of the distant fire. Most of the group follows while a couple less bothered members stay to watch the stars.

My brother, Alex, and I point out constellations. We're trying to remember the stories our grandmother taught us when the sounds of sloshing reaches us from across the lake.

Alex swings his light over. It barely reaches this spot in the middle where the water is disturbed. No one speaks, each of us aware that breaking the silence would hurt our chances of being the first to figure out what the fuck it was.

It was probably thirty seconds. Eyes squinted, heads tilted, before Alex whispers to look closely just past the fringes of his beam. There's a dark shape, bobbing up and down like an ice cube that'd been dropped into a glass of water. When the shape starts getting larger and the splashing louder, I tell Alex to turn the flashlight off. We force ourselves to walk toward the cabin. Within a few steps we’re all sprinting, full speed.

We scare the shit out of the others when we crash through the door. We begin to laugh, calling each other cowards. Our eyes wander occasionally to the window with a view of the lake as we accused each other of being the first to run. After we explain what we saw, Lexi mentions that maybe it'd be a good idea to turn the house lights off. Andrew's moaning about how we scared the girls again and we tell him to fuck off. He says that the owner mentioned there's a shotgun somewhere in the cabin for bears and if we're so worried to go and find it.

Convincing ourselves that it would make the girls feel better, we give the rusted gun to Alex; he'd gone hunting last summer with friends. Then we're goofing around, drinking and playing card games. One-by-one people start getting tired and retire to their rooms. At the time, my sleep schedule was fucked so Alex gives me the gun before leaving me in the living room alone. I read and play solitaire by lamplight for a couple hours until sometime in the early morning.

There’s a knock on the door. A minute passes where I believe I'd imagined it but then it's there again. Three tight raps against wood. I creep toward the peephole, my knuckles white against the shotgun.

The front door is enclosed by a screen porch. It was a nice place to hang out with the weather and free from bugs. There's a figure just outside the screen door. As soon as my eyes reach the peephole, it speaks. Like it knew I was there.

“Yo, let me in.”

I sigh, recognizing the voice, and grab the doorknob. I'm ready to scold him for scaring the shit out of me. But a stray thought invites goosebumps to my skin.

“What are you doing out there, Andrew?”

He pauses. “The outhouse. Someone was in the bathroom.”

The cabin only had one bathroom and an outhouse for emergencies. But I should’ve heard him leave. Even if it was through the back door.

“With no flashlight?”

He pauses again. “The moon.”

He sounded like Andrew. From what I could garner in the dark, he looked like Andrew. The height, the build, the edges of his outline. It all matched. If I could just get a glimpse of a cheekbone or the angle of his nose and be sure.

He knocks again. “Can you let me in?”

I jam the butt of the shotgun against my shoulder.

“No. I have a gun and I need you to leave now.”

“Can you let me in?”

“You have five seconds.” I curl my finger around the trigger. “Five…”

A shuffling from behind pulls my nerves taught like strings on a corset. I jerk around to aim at the shadow hovering in the middle of the living room.

“What the hell are you doing,” Andrew says. He switches on the lamp he's holding. He’s dressed in pajamas. A vicious cowlick mars his hair.

My trigger finger loosens. I turn back to the peephole. The figure is gone.

Soon, the whole cabin is awake with Andrew's yammering about how I almost killed him. I told them about the figure, but at that point everyone was getting tired of the spooky business. They used the fact that I barely sleep anyway to explain it away. Being young and stupid, believing I'd played a trick on myself was better than the alternative.

Still, with everything that'd happened that day, we scattered, locking doors and windows and making sure the blinds were pulled tight. It was probably four in the morning when I closed my eyes.

The next day we load into the cars. It takes half hour to get into town. Those of us with fake IDs drink at a pub while the others shop for groceries. A few beers deep the conversation shifts to the fire we saw yesterday.

“Where did you say you all were staying?” an elderly patron interjects. We tell him and he chuckles.

“Sure, tell the police but it won’t do no good.”

He said people in that area see fires at night and deserted camps when they go to check in the morning. No matter how many times the police go out there, they always return without much to work with.

Then he starts to ramble.

He sighed about how his home was becoming a ghost town. Trappers and hunters in the area, the majority population, were long gone. The forest had soured. Nowadays most people with property down that way just rent their places out.

On and on he went until our friends pick us up. We make a quick stop by the police station to file a report anyway.

There’s still a little bit of day left when we get back. We split off to do various things around the property. Andrew, Lexi, and I grab a machete and pick a random direction. Andrew hacks a path for our hike through the dry woods, hurtling splinters in every direction. It was slow progress for about ten minutes when he hesitates mid-stroke.

Nestled in a small clearing is an abandoned camp. There's a bed of leaves and a little blackened pit with rocks lining the edges. Andrew and I step inside and begin to look through the site. There's a strange symbol carved in the ash of the firepit. Andrew runs his fingers through the bed of leaves and recoils. He scoops a handful of them and uncovers a mutilated bird.

“Let's go,” Lexi says. "This is way too close." She’s still at the edge of the clearing, trailing her eyes about the dense forest. The trees press in on us, like we're in the center of a football huddle. I look at Andrew but he shakes his head. We weren’t going to let this ruin our vacation, he said. The guy at the pub said this was common, so we were going to act like it.

He smashes the bed of leaves with a swift kick. He motions us to back up. The machete flashes, chopping at nearby branches and Andrew tosses them across the site. “Now he knows we know he’s here. And he can fuck off.” He pushes on.

Lexi falls in behind us, lagging but close enough. We’re making good pace now. Andrew attacks the brush out of spite. Soon the forest thins out where the machete is useless. The trees here are well-fed and tower over our heads.

We take some time, resting and enjoying the scenery. A few weeks into spring the leaves are returning from winter as bright green buds speckling the branches. After a bit we decide to take some photos. We snap a few good ones, and some goofy ones where Andrew dons a scowl and raises the machete menacingly in our direction.

As Lexi poses for a solo flick, an object in the background catches my eye. I point it out to the others. In the distance, something like forty meters off, is a large oak. Pinned about ten meters up the tree, the head of a deer.

 “How did someone even get up there?” It’s in perfect condition. It’s antlers are thick and protrude far from its head in looping branches. The head is faced perpendicular to us. It's beady eyes frozen in a distant stare. We stand there with our necks craned looking at it for some time.

“Hold on,” Andrew says. He strolls towards the tree. Whistling as he goes, he swings the machete in a wide swooshing circle next to him. “Get a photo with me next it.”

Lexi sighs, muttering something about boys. I laugh. Andrew looks like some old-timey Broadway man, his rhythm accompanied with a blade in place of a cane. I bring the camera to my face. I point it at Andrew, and then the oak.

My throat closes up. Through the lens I see the deer-head with its neck twisted. Pointed in our direction now, its beady onyx eyes rest on us. Its nose twitches. It cocks its head. I can’t find my voice so I sort of groan at Andrew. He looks back at us, smiles, and then looks up. There’s a period, I can’t say for how long, where we stare and it stares back. And we realize our mistake. The waning light had confused us. The deer-head isn’t attached to the tree.

Wood snaps. Something behind the tree, something massive, moves and suddenly, we’re barreling through the woods. Branches claw at our face, roots grab at our ankles. At this point a brick wall wouldn't have stopped us. There’s a shrill screaming behind us. Impossibly loud and, to our horror, of human quality. I’m pushing Lexi from behind urging her to go faster. The best she can do is choke sobs between her gasps for breath.

Soon, we’re jumping through the abandoned campsite. The cabin is close. I hear a thud and a sharp gasp of pain. Andrew is behind me in a heap. The blade of the machete shimmers with a dark substance. I stop. “Get up.” The wailing of that thing is still following us, getting closer. He takes a step and collapses. A jet of liquid spurts from his groin.

“I think I cut myself,” he mumbles.

 I step closer to see, grabbing at his leg.

“Andrew,” I say in disbelief. “Andrew, you fucking idiot!”

The arterial spray shows no signs of weakening. Sticky redness paints his hands and pants. The trees shiver and another human scream forces me to act. I see Andrew’s lids droop. And then I’m running again.

“Wait…” But I don't stop running. I don't stop running until I'm past the porch and inside the cabin. Lexi had gotten there a few seconds before me. When I burst through the door, the room explodes in panic.

I'm screaming about how we needed to pack the cars and go, now. They want to know whose blood is on me and where Andrew is and what the fuck is going on, but I'm tearing through the rooms trying to find the shotgun.

Alex grabs my shoulders. “Breathe,” he says. “Gun’s in the living room but you gotta tell us what happened. Where’s Andrew? Was it a bear?”

“Andrew…” I start.

“Andrew’s here!” A voice calls from the living room. Alex and I turn the corner. Lexi's holding the front door wide open, beckoning to someone outside.

“Of course you can come in. Thank God, I thought that you were…”

Andrew’s head peeks from around the edge of the doorway. I wanted to laugh. To wrap him in a hug right there. But there’s something wrong with his face. Like someone had tried to draw him from memory. His hair is parted in the opposite direction. His eyes are wide. Paper thin lips curl into an odd smile.

“Lexi, get away from him.”

A gray blur flickers out from the door and the blade of the machete buries itself halfway through Lexi’s neck. She starts making this horrible gurgling sound, like she’s choking on water, and she hits the floor. Her head smacks the ground with a cartoonish splat.

Everyone's shrieking, jumping over the couch and bolting for the back door. Andrew enters the cabin, rising to full height, six inches taller than he should have been. He pries the machete from Lexi’s bubbling throat.

Alex takes a step forward, raises the shotgun. Thunder erupts inside the cabin. Andrew's right forearm, the one holding the blade, evaporates into a red mist that coats the wall behind him.

Our ears are ringing. I watch what follows in slow motion. Andrew raises his destroyed arm to inspect it, like a child trying to read a difficult book. Alex cocks the shotgun and fires again. This one misses, punching a watermelon-sized hole into the front door.

Andrew's face contorts. He unhinges his jaw like a python and screams; the same melody that had chases us through the woods. With disturbing speed he crouches, grabs Lexi’s ankle, and springs through the front door, dragging her limp body along like a suitcase.

My brother and I stand there before pushing each other forward.

A gleaming red carpet shimmered from the front door, down the porch, and towards the dock. Ripples lapped at the shore.

Our friends had taken the cars and fled, so Alex and I hiked up the long forest road. We made sure the shotgun was loaded and watched opposite sides of the forest for any movement or noises that teased us from the dark. After an hour of walking, we saw lights up ahead. Our friends had returned with the Sheriff.

No bodies were found. There was a small section in the local newspaper. No one could explain why Andrew had gone mad and hacked up Lexi. Most theories pegged him an undiagnosed psychotic, or his mind had fractured suddenly. But I have this horrible certainty that that wasn’t Andrew. You slice your femoral artery like he did, a five minute timer starts; sometimes quicker.

Years have passed. I’ve come to terms with being okay that I left Andrew behind when I did. Perhaps, if I hadn’t, it would have been me knocking on the cabin door. With a face that had eyes a little too wide, and a smile a little too thin.
