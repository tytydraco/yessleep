I’ve been working the night shift at my office for about six months now. It’s nothing glamorous—just data entry for a small marketing firm. The building itself is an old office complex, the kind with flickering fluorescent lights and water-stained ceilings. It’s empty after 6 PM, which is when I start my shift, so it’s usually just me and the hum of computers for company.

But lately, I’ve been noticing some weird stuff happening. At first, it was little things. Chairs being moved, papers shuffled around. I figured it was the cleaning crew messing with things after I left for the night. But then I realized—they only come in on weekends. I work during the week. So who’s been moving stuff around?

One night, I was sitting at my desk, headphones in, trying to zone out while I worked through another mindless data sheet. I was alone, like always, and everything was quiet except for the soft clicks of my keyboard. That’s when I saw it—movement, out of the corner of my eye.

I looked up, but there was nothing there. The office was empty, just the rows of cubicles stretching into the dim light. I shook it off, figuring it was just my tired brain playing tricks on me. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t really alone.

The next few nights, things got weirder. I started hearing noises—footsteps, the faint sound of papers rustling, doors creaking open and closed. I’d get up to check, walking through the maze of cubicles with my phone’s flashlight, but I never found anyone. The air would always feel colder, though, like the temperature dropped just a bit when I stepped away from my desk.

One night, I got fed up. I decided to stay late, well past my shift, just to see if I could catch whatever or whoever was messing with me. I figured maybe there was some maintenance guy or night guard I hadn’t met yet, just passing through and not realizing I was there.

Around 3 AM, when the office was dead quiet, I heard it again. Footsteps, slow and deliberate, coming from the hallway near the conference rooms. I grabbed my phone and stood up, creeping toward the noise. The sound was getting louder, like whoever it was had no intention of being quiet anymore.

I peeked around the corner into the hallway, expecting to see someone there. But it was empty.
Except for one door. The conference room door. It was wide open.

Now, I knew for a fact that I had closed that door earlier. I always do when I walk by. It bothers me to leave it open, like I’m trying to keep the place neat even though it’s just me in there. But now, it was open. And there was a light on inside.

I felt my stomach drop. I knew I hadn’t turned that light on. But maybe someone had come in without me noticing?

I stepped into the conference room, heart pounding. The light flickered slightly as I entered, casting shadows across the long table and chairs. I scanned the room, but it was empty. No signs of anyone. Just the faint hum of the overhead lights and the gentle sway of the curtains by the windows.

Then I noticed it. There was a notebook on the table—one I hadn’t seen before. It wasn’t my notebook. No one had been using the conference room for days. But there it was, sitting open like someone had been writing in it.
I walked over, cautiously, and looked down at the page. My blood ran cold.

The page was filled with my name. Over and over again, in tight, cramped handwriting, as if whoever had written it was in some kind of frenzy. The letters were dark, almost carved into the paper with how hard they pressed down.

I stood frozen for a second, trying to make sense of it, when I heard something behind me. A soft rustling, like the sound of someone shifting in their seat. Slowly, I turned around.

One of the chairs at the far end of the table—the one I had just checked—was now pulled out, as if someone had been sitting there. The air around it felt heavy, thick with something I can’t explain. And then, clear as day, I heard it:
A whisper. Right next to my ear.

I bolted out of that room so fast I nearly tripped over my own feet. I didn’t stop running until I was outside, standing in the cold night air, gasping for breath. I didn’t even bother going back for my stuff.

The next morning, I called my boss and quit. I told them I wasn’t feeling well, that I needed some time off. I didn’t mention the notebook or the chair or the whisper. Honestly, I don’t think they would have believed me.

I don’t know what’s going on in that office, but I’m not sticking around to find out. Whatever’s there? It’s watching. And it knows my name.
