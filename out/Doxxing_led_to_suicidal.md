I've been on many Discord servers by the passage of time. I always loved talking with people, trolling and just having fun online.

One time, a friend of mine from Discord invited me to some random 'gaming' server with about 400 members. A few days ago, that server got nuked by the old owner of the community. The nuke contained leaked data about the current owner of the server who was an average 14y old, so much data such as where he lived, his full name, his phone number, a photo of him, home address. People in that server were making fun of him and saying stuff such as "lol", "bro he's so ugly", etc. He was sometimes making racist jokes, and sexist jokes and was even blamed for doxxing even though no eligible evidence was found based on that. Still, after the server got raided, he tried begging for mercy and tried making the old owner delete all the data but it was already too late. When I thought things couldn't get any worse, the show just began as the old owner sent us a screenshot from a telegram channel with all his data leaked.

The next day, after waking up and preparing to start a new day full of assignments I haven't completed during the week, the owner of the server that just got nuked and whose personal data got leaked, locked the only remaining channel and sent there a video with the message "I hate you all". When I saw the text and a video with someone who seemed to be the one whose personal data got leaked because of the way the descriptions matched his way of looking, I was shocked. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't believe what was happening. I didn't want to watch the video but I was sceptical so before leaving the server, I decided to watch the video (after running it through a site to make sure there were no viruses). It was true. The person described by the leaks cut his hand veins. He was crying and telling the spectators about how the guy who leaked his data was destroyed.

I didn't finish the video because it had good graphics and I never liked watching content related to gore. I immediately reported the server on the Discord forum and got an E-Mail from them later on where I was told that actions took place on the server.

I couldn't believe what happened, I feel like It happened because of me, even though I did nothing at all, if I could know all the pain the guy who took his own life went through, I would have at least tried getting close to him and try stopping him before it was too late. After all, he was just some 14y old somewhat mentally unstable if asking me. But still, we're all humans and no one should take his own life.

It's hard for me to forget this but I still can't believe how heartless can some people be and what they would do just to revenge or troll.
