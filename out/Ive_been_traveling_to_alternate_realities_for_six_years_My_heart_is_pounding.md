As a teen, I dreamed of traveling to alternate realities. Realities where the stuff my heart desired was present. I wanted to go to realities where certain historical events had never happened or had gone in a different direction to see what the world would be like in the present day. I wanted to go to realities like ones where the Moon was twice its size, to see if anything would be different. Realities where some of my favourite TV shows had kept going, to see how they did with an extra season or two. It was a dream. One I thought was far out of reach until everything changed.


One evening during the 2016-2017 winter break, I was sitting on the chair in the living room, surfing the web as usual. My bedroom door creaked. It was followed by footsteps. So, I was alone in the house. My parents were at the store. I didn't hear anybody come into the house at all since they left. No matter who or what it was, I went cold. A person walked into my view. She looked similar to me. Similar in a way that struck me as odd. It was as if she was too familiar. Her walking speed, her short black hair, her general presence. She locked eyes with me for a second, then she rushed down the stairs and out the front door. I took a peek out the front window to get a look at her. She sprinted down the driveway, took a right onto the sidewalk and ran past the house.


Who was it? Maybe someone confused my house for theirs? But again, I knew I hadn't seen or heard anybody come in. I decided I hadn't paid enough attention to notice them walking in. I was frozen in thought. I stood up and checked my room just in case nothing was stolen. Everything was in its place. I shut the doors, then I called the police. When they arrived, I told them what I saw. They told me they'd keep a look out and to call if I saw her again. I agreed to do so, then they left.


On the first day back at high school, on my way to my first period class, I noticed something off. A dozen people were staring in my direction. Two people who were walking in my direction had anxious looks on their faces. They turned around to walk the other way. What was that about?


In class, right before the national anthem, my teacher spoke to me.


"I never thought you had it in you to do any of that kind of stuff," she said. "You always seemed so gentle."


"What stuff?" I asked. "What do you mean?"


"You know what you did," she stuttered. It didn't look like she wanted to talk about it, so I went on with my business. I was a quiet kid with only a few friends from childhood, so it's not like I was expected to talk anyway.


I never cared about what others would say if I didn't feel I had anything to understand about what they said. But going by the worried looks from earlier, I wasn't going to ignore her comment.


Throughout the day, there were more instances of people giving me weird looks, then turning around to walk away from me. Even my friends were giving me those looks. One of them told me they couldn't talk to me anymore.


After school, I messaged each of them. They didn't respond. An hour later, I checked back. One of them had blocked me. I wanted to know what happened, but no one was talking to me.


That night, I was laying on my bed, staring up at the ceiling. Why was everyone avoiding me?


A bright white light appeared in the corner of my eye. It was a bright white circle, detached from everything around it, hovering in the middle of the room. As I looked in confusion, a woman stepped out. She looked just like me. Oval head shape, same skin tone, same brown coloured eyes… it struck me as odd. Then I noticed she was holding a small white device in her right hand.


"How was school today?" She asked. The white light vanished behind him.


"Who…? what…?" I tried to string a sentence together.


"Of course you're confused. You wouldn't believe anything I'd say for a second. What I will tell you is that I'm the one who destroyed the school board headquarters. I framed you and now you look creepy and dangerous. Familiar?" She said.


"What are you talking about?" I asked.


"At school today, everyone probably looked at you funny," she said.


I gave him a confused look. Who was he? Did SHE really do something?


"You oblivious little shit," she said. "I'll just say this… I'm in a much better environment than you are, and that's how it's always going to be."


"Check your contacts," she said.


I went into my Gmail. When I saw the first message, my heart sank. It was from the York Region Police Department. This was the title:


"Evidence of terrorism traced to you - Nicole Winston"


It was my full name. I raised my eyebrow further in deeper confusion.


"Go to CP24 and read the top headline," she said.


I scrolled back up to the top. I took a better look at the big image. It was of a one-story building fire. Flames engulfed an entire building. Flames and black smoke poured out of the windows, with more black smoke rising from the roof. Papers were strewn all over the ground, laying in the grass and on the sidewalk. Firefighters were spraying water into one of the burning windows. A woman was running by. She looked to be about my age. In fact, she looked just like me. Right down to her eyes. It was odd to look at. She was looking at the camera. However, she didn't look shocked or panicked. Instead, she was smiling.


"Explosion rips (XXXXX) District School Board office building apart"


I skimmed through the article, then I looked up at her. She smirked. The sounds of police sirens echoed in the distance. They got louder with each passing second.


"They'll be here in a few seconds," she said.


I was frozen. Flashing blue and red lights began to shine on the window. I got up and looked outside. Three police cars drove up to the front of the house. The mysterious woman walked up beside me.


"What's… going on here?" I asked.


"That would take too long to explain," she said.


"Who are you?" I asked.


She pulled out an ID. It had my full name and my exact date of birth on it. There was an image of me that looked a couple years older. Just like the woman who was holding the ID in front of me. She put it back into her pocket while locking eyes with me, giving me an even bigger smirk.


She was me from an alternate reality. She was framing me. As for why she did what she did, I wanted to ask her, but nothing came out. Instead, I pushed her. As she staggered back, the device fell out of his hand, hitting the ground with a light thud. I tackled him to the ground in an attempt to defend myself in some way, though it was fruitless. I had never done such a thing before. I barely knew any self defense techniques. My alternate self had a look of shock on her face. Of course, she was my alternate self. I had never pushed or tackled anyone before, so she wouldn't have seen it coming. I got up and kicked her device against the wall. The white light returned as the device bounced off the wall. There was no way I was getting out of this. My alternate self came here for a reason. If she has high tech gear, she's well equipped to successfully do what she wanted to do. Everyone sees me as a threat. There's no way I'll ever have friends or good acquaintances again. Her device was sitting on the ground, not a meter away from me. I scooped it up, then I jumped into the light.


A sense of disorientation hit me, then I was pushed back by an invisible force. It felt like a strong wall of wind. Seconds later, the light vanished. I noticed I was still in my room. I looked to my left. My alternate self was gone. I peeked out the window. The driveway was empty. The night was calm.


I looked around. "Did I really just… walk into another reality?"


I stared at the spot on the ground my alternate self was just standing on.


"He's not there. The police aren't outside…"


"What the hell? What even was all of that? At least I'm not in his reach. Hopefully, he didn't have a backup plan."


I waited a couple of hours to see if anything would happen to me. If my alternate self had backup, they'd have to arrive in minutes. Reality hopping can not be taken lightly if devices were made to help one do it. Those two hours passed without a single thing happening. I sat and waited, but nothing. Soon enough, my curiosity levels were up. I went onto my phone to see if my friends were still open to my messages. I was able to see their posts. I messaged them a quick hello. They both responded with a casual hello.


At school the next day, no one gave me a weird look. My friends spoke to me about their favourite movies just as they did before the winter break. The teachers didn't look concerned any time I walked up to them. I checked my school work to make sure it was at least about as finished as the work in my home reality was. It was about half of that, but I took it. I was in a better place.


On the walk back home, I thought about my situation a bit more. What should I do if my alternate self returned? Who do I even go to who would believe me? How did my alternate self get his device? How different was this reality from my own. I knew I could have that question answered with some Google searches. I didn't usually see a need to bring my phone to school, so I didn't have it with me. Nonetheless, my curiosity was going up again. I picked up my pace.


After I got back home, I got onto the internet to research some history. The Soviet Union still collapsed in 1991. Obama still won the 2008 US Election. Fidel Castro still passed away in 2016. I only found two big differences in the timeline, which stand out against the rest only due to it having been my first time traveling to another reality.


1. A technological revolution took place in the 1920s-50s which meant computer technology was 20 years ahead of what it was in my home reality.


2. WW2 involved a different German nationalist dictator. He committed the same atrocities and had also fought the Soviet Union.


While that reality was nice, I wanted to find out the extent of what the device could do. Could it only let me travel to realities similar to my own? Or could I travel to… any reality? I took the device out of my pocket. There were six buttons on it. A big white button labeled "Rift," two buttons with arrows on them, two buttons labeled "Alt," and one button labeled "Random." At the top was an led screen displaying a six-digit number.


How was I going to learn how to use this?


I played around with the numbers until I landed on a five digit number. I looked the buttons over and assumed the Rift button must be the one that opens the portal. I pressed the button, then a bright ripple of white light reappeared a meter away from me. Without thinking, I stepped into the light.


After the light disappeared, I glanced around my room. My posters were gone. Everything was gone, aside from the bed. I stepped out of the room. I creeped down the hallway, glancing in every direction, looking for even the tiniest difference. The portraits were gone too. I stepped into the living room. The portraits in there were gone as well, although the tables and couches were still present.


As I looked around in confusion, a wild growl echoed outside. It sounded more like the scream of a human in intense pain. It got louder. Closer. What was making it? As I stared around, a man jumped up against the window. His skin was pale white, his jaw hung low as if it were about to detach from his face, and blood was dripping out of his eyes, nose, and mouth. He let out another bone-chilling screech and punched the window. I nearly screamed. The thing smashed itself against the window again and again and again.


I grabbed the device. As I eyed the buttons, the sound of shattering glass rang out from the direction of the window. I looked up to see the feral man had crashed through the window. He was on the ground, glancing around until resting his eyes on me. He lunged at me. I sprinted. When I got into my room, I slammed the door shut. Then there was a thud. The door shook. I set the numbers higher and hit . The pounding on the door got louder and louder. The portal opened. With another bang, I heard the crack of wood breaking. Small splinters of the door landed to my left. I started into the portal.


All my stuff was back. There was no longer a banging on the door. I glanced behind me to find the door wasn't damaged at all. 


If I had stayed there for another 10 seconds, I wouldn't have lived for very long.


I gently opened the door. I creeped down the hallway, observing my surroundings for any differences. I kept my head down a bit, hoping the third reality I traveled to was a safe one.


I stepped into the living room. The family portraits and furniture were there, but they were all of different people. The TV was larger, multiple grey boxes were attached to the ceiling, and handheld scanners sat on each of the tables. I walked up to the scanner on the coffee table and picked it up to look at it. A series of weird symbols were marked on the side, with writing in English below them.


"Subconscious Brain Wave Scanning"


As I looked at the device, a low hum came from outside. The items in the room began to shake. I peeked out the window. The house directly across the street was a pile of rubble. Tall grass covered the lawn and patches of grass shrouded up through the cracked driveway. The neighbouring houses had similar looking lawns, with some plants all over every wall and window. Abandoned? But why? As I looked on, I noticed one or two people walking into the view of the window. A few people followed behind. But it turned out to be a dozen. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they had pale shocked looks on their faces.


What was going on?


A thin black tentacle swung by the window. I looked upwards. A second tentacle began to hover above the driveway of the house neighbouring the leveled house. It pierced through one of the front windows of the house. Seconds later, it pulled out a man. He struggled as he was carried up into the air. A pit formed in my stomach. I stepped back into the hallway. I wasn't going to let anybody see me. Especially not whoever was controlling those tentacles.


I wasn't going to leave yet, though. I wanted some context. I took out my phone. I looked up "crowds with their hands tied behind their backs." A few results came up.


"Asanan military forces tighten grip on dying farmland"


There were a few articles about a military front called the Asanau. I looked them up.


"The Asanau Occupation is an ongoing military conflict that began in 2006 when the Asanau-led invasion front launched a series of EMPs on 12 metropolitan areas across the world. Hours after their attack, the force launched a full scale invasion. Most of the world's military bases were destroyed, most nuclear weapons were stolen, and millions of people were used as fuel for Asanau Military vehicles. The Asanau occupied 98% of the world in the space of two weeks. Since June 2007, They have subjected billions to re-education, misinformation, inhumane experimentation, lifelong prison sentences without fair trial, and have barred human culture by banning humans from creating media. All human media released after October 28, 2006 was destroyed."


It read like something out of a sci-fi movie. To have witnessed some of it was heart racing enough. My stomach dropped as I read more.


I didn't want to believe it was real, but I had just gotten a taste of it. It was gut wrenchingly terrifying.


Before leaving, I decided to take one of the scanners as proof I was there. When I stepped into the living room, a dark grey machine with a round tinted window was peeking in through the front window. I got cold. I lunged back into the hallway and stopped once I got out of the view of the machine. The sound of shattering glass came from the living room. A tentacle reached into the hallway and lunged at me. I sprinted into my room and slammed the door shut.


Staring the device, I set the numbers down by a few thousand. The sound of shattering glass hit my left ear. A wave of dread washed over me. I jolted my eyes towards the window out of pure instinct. Without thinking at all. Before I knew it, a tentacle wrapped itself around my torso and lifted me up off the ground. I was frozen at this point. I was pulled straight out of my house. The dread I had choked me as I was carried towards the machine. It had a dozen long sharp appendages sticking out of its head. I pointed the device towards it and pushed Rift. The portal opened in between the machine and I. I heard an electric clap, then I began to fall. I wasn't too far off the ground, but I pulled a fast one. I aimed the device towards the ground, then I double pressed Rift. A portal opened up on the ground. I fell into it and a wall of disorientation hit me.


When the portal closed, all I could taste was grass. I picked myself up. I was sitting beside the driveway. I spat all the grass out of my mouth, then I glanced around. The machine was gone. The house across the street was back to normal. I glanced up at my window… It was in one piece.


I looked at the device. While it was cool, I had gotten myself into two dangerous scenarios in a row with it. I knew right then reality jumping wouldn't be so smooth, at least not for as long as I didn't know how the numbers worked. Once I learned how to travel smoothly, I wouldn't end up in a dangerous reality without wanting to. I did not want to go through any of that stuff again, but I realized I may have to in order to learn how it works. My stomach tightened, but I countered anxiety with hope of a unique life path.


I didn't notice anything hovering in the sky, to my relief. I checked the internet to see if anything big was going on anywhere. After some research, I found the reality I landed in wasn't different from my home reality, so I went right inside. My family's portraits were back. I sighed in relief. I walked to my room, ready to figure out how I should set the numbers for a smoother trip.


When I opened my door, someone was laying in my bed. They had the same hair, facial structure, and clothes as I did at that moment. Oh god, I found another alternate me. He asked me who I was. Based on his laid back demeanor, I could guess he wasn't the same version of me who probably wanted to kill me for taking this device. The alternate me I was looking at adopted a look of confusion on his face. I didn't know what to say. It didn't have to be complicated anyway. I told him I had gotten the wrong house, then I shut the door.


I set Alt to two, then I pressed Rift. When the portal closed, I saw my face from the corner of my eye. Another alternate me was standing to my right. He looked just as confused as I was. I didn't have time to talk, and in all honesty, it felt weird to see myself in person. Especially a different alternate self. I set Alt to three and pressed Rift. I jumped into the portal. He was gone. I opened the door a crack. No one was laying on the bed. I had no way of knowing whether it was my home reality, so I hung out and did my usual hobbies. Nobody who looked similar to me walked into the room. My parents didn't look surprised or shocked when they saw me, so my presence was normal. It wasn't at all my home reality, but it was going to work. As for where my alternate self from that reality was, I never ended up figuring that out… maybe they were kidnapped and taken to another reality just minutes before I arrived. Hopefully whatever happened didn't matter too much.


Throughout 2017, I had the time of my life traveling to different realities. I went to realities that were historically interesting to me, such as one where the Korean War turned into a wider war. The war took place across Southeast Asia and led to much deeper wounds in geopolitical relations. I also treated myself to personally interesting realities, such as one where Community went on for an extra season. Not every reality had to be about history, death, or destruction.


There were other downsides too. At one point, I began to feel an absence of my surroundings. It was as if nothing outside of what I could see existed, even though I knew it was all there. Jumping to many different realities made everything feel too simple. The feeling persisted, giving me a numbing depression throughout the fall and winter of 2017, which weakened a little bit in early 2018. I didn't understand what I was feeling. I took a break from traveling until the depression subsided in April 2018. I knew it was some sort of burnout and the break I took was enough for me to recharge my energy. I decided to travel only when I felt excited about or the most interested in something. That's what I've been doing since.


I had a much better time going to different realities throughout 2018 through early 2020. A personal example of this was when I traveled to a reality where the most mysterious song on the internet was a big hit in 1984. It rivaled the success of Tears For Fears, had somewhat of an influence on 80s samples, and was sampled by artists like The Weeknd (I still have my copy "I Feel You Cry" which was the lead single for that reality's After Hours.) From there, I found the name and artist. Traveling to alternate realities where lost things are very popular is such a no-brainer for finding them. If you have the technology, you can do it. I did it with many pieces of lost media. It was rewarding, especially as I had gotten used to my new home reality.


While my new home reality was great, it wasn't long until I had to leave it. In early 2020 in that reality, a virus named AIVD-20 began spreading like wildfire. The common symptoms included dry skin, sore throat, vomiting, intense fever, and lightheadedness. The main effect of the virus was the near-total destruction of the immune system. By the end of April 2020, every world leader had it. I didn't think it would get any worse until every world leader began to drop. Celebrities and billionaires weren't spared either. A few celebrities were caught partying in public and were scrutinized for it, but they died before they could acknowledge it and admit it was dangerous to treat the virus as if it didn't exist. Although, they didn't do those things in your reality according to what I've looked up, so I guess they wouldn't have done so anyway.


By the end of June 2020, there were more than 600,000 newly reported worldwide cases of AIVD-20 each day. By mid-July 2020, a quarter of the town I lived in had come down with it. Nobody had been outside for weeks. No cars drove by for weeks. Things were eerily silent.


I was afraid of experiencing the symptoms, so I searched for a reality where the virus never spread. In every reality I checked, the virus spread to some world altering degree. Sometimes it began spreading a couple years earlier. Other times it was delayed to the near future, which I checked by traveling to a version of those realities that took place ten years into the future.


At one point, I got exhausted. There was no way a pandemic wasn't inevitable, although that didn't mean AIVD was spreading in every single reality. I looked for a reality where a less intense virus was spreading instead. That reality is your reality. The reality I'm in right now.


At one point, I got morbidly curious about what ended up happening to me in each of the realities where that virus spread. I traveled to a bunch of them. Some where the virus began spreading earlier and some where the virus began spreading later. In each of them, I'd see my alternate self's eyes widen after I appeared in their room. I'd ask them if they had any issues during or after the pandemic. Each one told me they didn't understand what was happening and began to shake.


I noticed that in half of those realities, my alternate selves had multiple bruises on their faces. They ran at the sight of me. The more I encountered this, the creepier it got. A pit formed in my stomach. Does that mean I'm going to be in that condition at one point? I asked the first couple of them what had happened. They told me to leave them alone. I wasn't going to assume anything drastic, considering the amount of possibilities there are. Instead, I assumed it was something that only happened in that string of realities, in order to assure myself things were most likely fine. I dreaded the idea of my alternate self finding me.


So far, I have traveled to 485 different realities. Many of them were fun, many of them were terrifying, and many of them were just interesting. I've decided I'm comfortable sharing my journey with you all. I've even listed each of the realities I've been to and their numbers from the sixth one onward, but it includes very personal realities, so I might not share it unless I redact the most personal stuff.


I'm typing this out in a restaurant right now. Currently, I'm in your reality. Just a minute ago, three people stormed into the bathroom behind someone. I heard some thuds followed by muffled shouting. It's happening again to somebody else right now. No one seems to be doing anything about it. Although, there is only one other customer here. What are the ambushers doing? Why are they taking multiple people in? My adrenaline is rising. Hopefully it's not what I'm thinking it is. I'm going to take a pause from writing this until I get back home. A waiter is eyeing both me and the other customer, as I can see out of the corner of my eye. None of this is making any sense, which is making whatever is going on creepier. I'll update later with more info about my journey.
