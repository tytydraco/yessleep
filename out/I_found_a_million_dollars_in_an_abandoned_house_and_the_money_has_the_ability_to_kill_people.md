  

I swung the sledgehammer like I was turning on a fastball. It smashed into the bricks in the fireplace, the spot where you might hang a family photo. The bricks exploded, little bits blasting into my skin and ticking off my safety goggles. 

I swung again, and the sledge didn't go clear through to the inside of the flue that led up to the old, crumbling chimney. I'd hit something. Usually the only thing you find in a chimney is a dead animal. But it wasn’t a raccoon carcass, a mummified corpse doesn’t stop a sledge with a dull thud.

Then, things started to fall to the bottom of the fireplace. Whatever it was had been wedged up there, held in place by the brick. When the dust settled, I could see cellophane. It looked like cinder blocks wrapped in plastic.

I ducked down and pulled one of them out, and it didn't carry the weight of a cement. I pushed the goggles up onto my forehead and squinted. The cellophane was wrapped around fuck knows how many times, so whatever was inside wasn't visible. 

I used my jackknife to cut into it, peeled back the layers, and saw President Jackson staring at me. I frantically pulled at the wrapping and came out with a wad of twenties. There was a two thousand dollar bank band around the stack, and I took its word for it. 

There were fifty stacks in the package. There were three more wrapped blocks on the bottom of the fireplace. I took them out and arranged them on the hearth. I reached my hand into the hole I’d bludgeoned and felt around. *There.* 

After a nudge, six more fell into the fireplace. I didn't bother counting it all, but I did the math. Two thousand bucks a stack. Fifty stacks per block. Ten blocks. One million dollars. Approximately nine-hundred ninety-nine thousand dollars more than I currently had to my name. 

Your humble servant Mitch Flynn was dirty, rotten, filthy, stinking rich.

\*\*\*

I’d gotten out of high school seven years before this happened. College wasn’t in the cards for financial reasons. 1.8 GPAs don't get you a full ride at most institutions of higher learning, if you can believe it. I kicked around doing minimum-wage jobs that I couldn't hold down, mostly because I didn’t like being told what to do. 

My buddy Jesse Chambers went into the house-flipping business and offered me work cleaning out foreclosed properties he bought. The ungodly things I’ve seen…I’ll spare you most of the details in case you plan on eating at some point this week. 

I started doing it for a couple of other guys regularly, and this expanded into the demo work to prepare a place for renovations. The work wasn't steady, given the real estate market here in Western Maine wasn't booming at the time. I could make a thousand bucks every couple weeks, and that was enough to keep beer in the fridge. 

This particular gig wasn’t that bad. The house way up on Pine Ridge wasn't squalid and had only been empty for the past year or so. The only disturbing thing was the splatter of red on the bedroom wall and the buckshot peppered into the plaster. 

The home's former occupant, Richard Burgess, had met a rather untimely demise. I could only remember three or four other murders in Buckton in my lifetime. This one remained unsolved, but the local police assured everyone that there was no danger to the public. That's always code, for we know who did it, we don't have enough evidence to charge him, and Richard Burgress had it coming. 

So in the grand scheme of how surprising it is to find a million dollars, I'd rate this one on the low end of shock. It made sense. Richard was involved in unseemly shit, someone was pissed at him, money was involved, and poor old Richie got turned into Swiss cheese by a twelve gauge in his master bedroom.

Richard wasn't the best and brightest, so I was confident that the money was ill-gotten. That doesn't mean I should keep it, but that knowledge would make me sleep better at night if that's the way I decided to go. 

It was a victimless crime. Not even a crime at all. A victimless *find*. So I cruised back into town and went to Walmart. I bought two big duffel bags that could hold fifty pounds in them. A million bucks weigh a hundred and ten pounds, all told, I later learned. 

So I stuffed the wrapped bricks into the two bags and tossed them in the trunk of my Kia. I dumped the unwrapped brick into my backpack and placed it on the passenger seat. As I drove, I unzipped it and occasionally stuck my hand into the bag to convince myself that it was real. 

I was going to go right home because having the money in the car made me nervous. But that felt final to me, as if crossing the threshold of my third-floor walk-up with the cash made it permanent. 

Instead of heading home, I parked outside Hack's, where I could see my car from the barstool through the plate glass window. 

Laura Childs was tending bar. She had been a couple of years ahead of me in school and had a Coors Banquet poured before my ass hit the stool. I thanked her and sipped it, staring blankly at SportsCenter playing silently on a TV over the bar. 

Only a couple of other guys were in the place, and they were shooting pool. Laura caught me stealing furtive glances out the window at my car between texts to her boyfriend. She told me not to worry - my ride wouldn't get towed. I tried to laugh it off, but she could see something was wrong with me. I polished off four beers in less than an hour and felt pretty buzzed. 

But the beer gave me the courage to do what I needed: go home and stash the money in a closet. I thanked Laura then reached into my pocket. I had peeled off two twenties from my backpack before coming inside. 

The beers came to twelve bucks. The bills felt crisp and perfect as I pulled them out and tossed them on the bar. Laura looked at me curiously, and I told her to keep it. She shrugged and thanked me. I headed for the door just as she picked up the money and turned for the cash register.

I heard the drawer slide open, and then there was a crash. Stacked glasses behind the bar shattered as they hit the floor. I whipped around to see Laura on the ground, her legs twitching, her eyes rolling back in her head. She was gasping the last breaths she'd ever take.

\*\*\*

I waited for the paramedics to arrive after one of the pool guys called 9-1-1, but it was too late. When the ambulance pulled up, and the two EMTs ran in, they took one look at Laura and knew it was over. One of them said something about a “massive cerebral hemorrhage” to a couple of the cops and firefighters that showed up as they zipped her into a body bag.  

I wasn't exactly sure what happened next. I stood on the sidewalk, watched as Laura's body was loaded into the back of the meat wagon, and headed for…the hospital? I guess that's right. They didn't need to run the lights and siren, that’s for sure. She was taking her last ride, now a dead single mother who left a two-year-old behind. 

When I got in the car, I took the backpack from the floor of the passenger side, where I'd stashed it before going into the bar. I unzipped it just to make sure the money was still there. It was. 

I drove home in a daze. I had never seen anyone die before, not even one of my grandparents. Not my father. No one I was close to had ever *gone to be with their Lord and Savior while surrounded by their loving family,* as the obits always note.  

Maybe the beer or Laura's death caused me to run one of the two stoplights in town. This time the sirens were used as Sgt Jim Daley hit the blues. He was a prick's prick, still ass sore at the world because he was cut from the JV football team in high school.

He walked over to the Kia, and I could see the spit-shined boots approaching in my side view mirror. I secretly popped a piece of gum in my mouth just as Daley rapped a knuckle on the window. That's when I realized the backpack was wide open, and the money was visible. 

I thought of zipping it up but didn't want to draw attention to it, so I tried to play it cool. I rolled down the window and told Daley I needed to pay better attention. He sniffed and said yeah, that would be a good idea. 

He asked me where I was coming from, and I told him Hack's. He said he heard on the radio about Laura and I said that she was dead. He grunted, and I couldn't tell if it was out of a sense of pity. Probably not. 

He asked how much I had to drink, and I gave him the stock answer he was probably expecting – just a couple of beers. Daley grunted, and with that noise, there was no ambiguity. He didn't believe me, could smell the bullshit as easily as my peppermint booze breath. 

I thought about all the shithouse, barstool lawyers I'd known on shitty job sites. *Never blow. You never fucking blow.* I knew if I did refuse, my license would automatically be revoked, and I needed to drive. It wouldn't be an OUI, but it would effectively be the same. 

I tried to decide if I should roll the dice with the breathalyzer. Twenty-two years ago, you couldn't pull up a BAC calculator on your iPhone. 

It was going to be close. I weighed a buck seventy soaking wet. Four 5% beers in forty-five minutes. That had been over an hour ago, though. 08? .07? .1? Whatever it was, Jim Daley wasn’t exactly a smack you on the ass and tell you to head right home type of fella. 

I looked up at him and saw myself in the reflection of his dickhead issue aviator sunglasses. He asked for my license and registration. I leaned over to the glovebox to grab the latter. As I did that, I used my left hand to try and covertly close the backpack. 

I made a big production of trying to find the registration. When I heard Jim sigh, I pulled it out and handed it to him. Instead of looking at it, he nodded toward the bag. 

I told him I had just finished a big job up on Pine Ridge. He said that was an awful lot of cash, and I agreed. He asked if it was the Burgess place. I thought of lying but realized he'd know if I was, so I told the truth. 

He asked me to step out of the vehicle. I walked the line like a fucking ballerina. I followed his finger like a red-tail hawk on Adderall. I said the alphabet forward like a genius three-year-old. But for fuck's sake, if I didn't stumble on reciting the alphabet backward. That's some rigged shit right there. Try it right now. Fast. Not so easy, is it?

So when I tripped over K-J-I-H and said K-J-H-I instead, Daley smiled and told me to get back in my vehicle. I figured he was going back to his cruiser to get the breathalyzer., I watched him in my rearview, and he just ducked his head inside the vehicle's window. He came back empty-handed.

I don't know for sure, but I guess he was turning off his dashboard cam. There were no body cameras in those days, just the shit you saw on COPS back in the day. *Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do?* 

When he got back, he leaned casually with his forearms on the rolled-down window of my car, now smiling at me like we were old friends. 

He let the sunglasses slide down his nose so I could see that his eyes were fixated on the bag of cash. I could tell he wouldn't bring it up first; he was waiting for me to make the opening move. I asked how much, and he said how much for what. I said how much to let me go home and forget this happened.

He said all of it. A hundred thousand dollars, minus the forty I'd laid on the bar for Laura, the last transaction of her earthly existence. One hundred thousand bucks to get off of an OUI. I might as well take the penalty. Hell, I even had enough cash to hire a fancy lawyer. Maybe even Seth Robinson.

I knew his actual price had to be lower, so I said five thousand. He countered with ten, and I said fuck it. I was feeling magnanimous. It's not often someone from a shit-bum family like mine has the leverage over a big swinging dick like Tim Daley. I told him I'd throw in an extra two grand just because he was such a swell guy.

I reached into the backpack and fished out six bands. I started to hand Daley the cash. Cars passed, slowing to gawk to see who had been a naughty boy. Daley put up a hand, telling me to stop. 

We couldn't do this here in broad daylight. He asked if I knew where he lived, and I said over on Somerset, right? He said to stop by after dark, maybe around 8:00.

I exhaled as he drove off in his cruiser, figuring that my problems were over. 

\*\*\*

After lugging the duffel bags up to my palatial third-floor estate and sticking them in the back of my bedroom closet, I popped a frozen pizza in the oven. I didn't turn on the TV or the radio while waiting. I just thought about what I was going to do with the money. 

Maybe I'd go to Florida. Drop a couple hundred grand on a nice two-bedroom on the Gulf somewhere and spend my days drinking beer and fishing. It would beat the fuck out of the Maine winters. 

When it was a quarter to eight, I took the money for Daley and placed it in a plastic shopping bag. I hopped in the car and cruised over to his ranch on Somerset. The motion light in the driveway flipped on, and I saw him sitting in a lawn chair in the garage. *The Italian Lanai,* as my grandmother called it.

He got up and waved me in, flicking on the light over a workbench. I handed him the bag and he pulled out a stack and took a pen from the bench. He drew a line on a twenty with it and held it up to the light, ensuring it wasn't counterfeit. 

He said it looked good. I nodded and turned to leave, and he told me he wanted another five grand next month. I stared at him and considered the situation, calculating if I still had the advantage. Who had more to lose? I had a million minus twelve thousand and forty dollars to lose. But him? He had a lot more to lose. So I told him to fuck off.

I realized this was a mistake when he reached into the drawer of his bench and took out his service weapon. He raised it. I took a step back into the shadows. He pointed it at his head…

And pulled the trigger. The sound amplified in the enclosed space. He fell to the ground, the gun clattering on the cement floor. 

Blood trickled toward a drain. I started for my car to get the fuck out of there, but then, I bolted for the plastic bag. I grabbed it off the bench and got back in the Kia. 

As I peeled out of the driveway, I saw neighbors’ porch lights going on and heard dogs barking. I made it home in one piece. I clicked on my father’s old police scanner and listened to the situation unfold.

I didn't do anything, but no one else knew that. I didn't need to be spotted at the scene of a cop's death. I mean, it was a suicide, right? 

Then I waited. Waited until I heard the words – *killed himself.*  Then I clicked the scanner off and went to bed.

\*\*\*

My eyes snapped open just as I was about to doze off. I know it seems obvious to you now. I'm sure it clicked for you when Daley pulled the trigger and blew his brains out all over the garage, but not for me. Maybe the trauma of what I'd witnessed that day had clouded my thinking, caused me to not see everything clearly.

Like I said before, I had never seen anyone shuffle off their mortal coil in my presence before Laura in the bar that afternoon. And now? I’d seen two in the space of five hours. Coincidence? Bloody unlikely, given the circumstances. 

The last thing that either of them ever did was accept a little bit of the money I’d pulled from the chimney at Richard Burgess’ house. At first, I thought that maybe the money was laced with something. Or that it had been exposed to something in that chimney – lead or mercury. 

Maybe. But both deaths happened quickly, in almost an instant. Would lead or mercury act that quickly? And why the hell didn't it impact me? Maybe I had some kind of natural immunity to what it was, built up over my years of low-level exposure to Christ knows what in these abandoned houses. 

Perhaps Laura’s death was just the finger of fate reaching out and whispering *now.* And maybe, just maybe, Daley had been on the take for years, and this was the one that finally did it, pushing him over the edge. The guilt had become unbearable. 

These were not rational thoughts. But the conclusion I kept coming back to was even *less* logical. Despite that, it still seemed more likely.  

There was something about the money. Something…cursed. And whatever that was, I was spared from it. Why? I couldn’t begin to guess and wasn’t about to give it another moment of consideration.

I shot up out of bed and ripped open the closet door. I lugged one of the duffel bags out onto the private back porch.

It was dark back there; the rear of the apartment building butted up against the woods. I could hear peepers chirping their late summer night songs. A cigarette-induced cough hacked out from someone in the darkness.

I took the cover off of my charcoal grill and cut into the cellophane of one of the bundles with a knife. Once I unwrapped the stacks, I placed them on the grill surface. Then, I grabbed the bottle of lighter fluid.

I held it over the money and hesitated. I half expected that when the fluid hit the paper, it would start to sizzle without the aid of a struck match. 

But that didn’t happen because I didn’t put the fluid on the money. I scraped the stacks off the grate, dumping them back into the duffel bag with one swoop of my arm.

\*\*\* 

I know what you're thinking, and I don't blame you. I suspected I had a million *murder dollars* in my possession, and I didn't immediately destroy them. It's ok for you to judge my decision to not torch them on the grill as soon as I suspected I had played a role – albeit unintentional – in the deaths of Laura and Tim Daley. 

That would have been the utterly rational, reasonable, and morally correct thing to do. There were two reasons why I didn't do this. First, I still wasn't sure. I was leaving the door open for the infinitely small possibility of coincidence. 

I needed to prove it, and what if there was a way I could?. Maybe I could look at the local online sex offender registry. I could check to see what each of them did – the records were readily available – and then pay them a visit. The logic of why I would be giving them money still needed to be worked out, but I was spitballing. 

I could find the most heinous one, give him some of the loot, and see what happened. But even though I’d be doing society at large a solid, it didn’t sit right with me. There was something a bit too…murder-y about it. 

Whatever our collective disgust for their crimes might be, according to our laws, these people – men, mostly – paid for what they’d done. Even if that doesn't mean they *atoned* for it, I wasn't keen on going around as some pedo Punisher. 

The second reason I didn't burn it all was that I couldn't. I don't know if it was this money in particular or if it would have been *any* money that amounted to just under a million dollars. But it held me. It enraptured me. I thought about it constantly. I would open the duffel bags, peel back some cellophane, and caress the money. *Myyyy preciousssss.* 

That's a weakness on my part. It would have been different if I'd grown up with money and not dirt poor. But that doesn't make much sense now that I see it in writing. The rich, long noted for their lack of greed and avarice, right?

But back to the first reason – I needed to be sure. What if it was just dumb luck? I couldn't let all this money go to waste, not when I didn't have a pot to piss in. 

I thought of other angles. Maybe I could deposit it at the bank, which would be like laundering it, getting it clean of whatever cursed it. I wouldn't deposit it at the window because I didn't want to inadvertently kill some poor teller just because I was sick of driving my shitbox car and living paycheck to paycheck. 

Maybe I could deposit it in the ATM a bit at a time, drawing on it as needed. Of course, I wasn't sure how that would play out. Would it kill the bank manager or the Wells Fargo armored truck guy when he came to empty the machine? So that was out.

Every idea met a dead end except for one. Remember what I said about people who have done their time and paid their debt to society? What about people who haven't? What if there were someone who was so unassailably bad that he deserved to die? Someone that I knew was bad because he had killed my sister and escaped justice.

\*\*\*

Cora was two years younger than me and dating Rowan Gorman. This was when I was nineteen. His father was a doctor at the hospital, and the kid was entitled. My daughter calls them lax bros and fuck boys these days. I’m sorry if my class warfare is showing. 

Rowan and Cora would date on and off until she would break up with him. But she would always take him back, even when she showed up with bruises at Thanksgiving dinner the year before my father died.

After graduation, Rowan was headed off to Duke, and Cora to nursing school in Portland. She got the brains in the family. I overheard them fighting in the living room the night before the prom. 

It wasn't overhearing, though, as that suggests I was eavesdropping. This was a knockdown drag-out donnybrook. It didn't get physical, probably because Rowan knew I was there and I had thirty pounds on him. 

But Cora was trying to break up with him, and Rowan wasn't having it. Certainly not on the night before prom. There was lots of crying, teenage angst, and threats. Rowan finally said he was going to kill himself. Don’t do us any favors, I remember thinking. I heard the door slam and heard Cora crying in the kitchen. Good. At least he was gone.

I was going to give her a minute before I went out and consoled her. But then the crying stopped, and I heard the door slam again. Now she was gone.

I came out of my bedroom and went out the door of the apartment onto the front porch. Three stories below, I saw Rowan's BMW screeching across the dirt parking area with Cora standing in its path. I screamed for Cora to get out of the way, but she didn't hear me over the skid of tires kicking up rocks and gravel.

The car stopped inches from her shins, and I breathed a tiny sigh of relief. Cora started yelling at him, asking him what the fuck he was doing, was he trying to kill her? She went to the passenger side door and got in; that was the last time I saw her. 

She called me on her cell phone five minutes later. She was in the car and sobbing. I couldn't hear her over Rowan's shouts and her tears. She screamed that he said he was going to kill them both. She said he was doing a hundred and ten. I heard a loud slap, which was Rowan backhanding Cora in the face. 

Her phone spilled from her hands, and stayed connected. That's when they hit the old railroad trestle bridge underpass doing seventy. That was according to the engine diagnostics. Thank the maker for German engineering. The readout also provided clear evidence that the brakes were not so much as tapped.

Rowan was wearing his seatbelt. Cora was not. 

\*\*\*

Rowan's father hired Seth Robinson, the best lawyer in town. I testified, and he did his best to push my buttons and get me to contradict my story on the stand. He was good, and as I told you, Cora got the brains in the family. She never would have walked into the traps he set for me. 

So instead of vehicular manslaughter, of which he was found not guilty, Rowan got off with driving to endanger - three hundred bucks and community service. 

I cold-cocked him when I saw him coming out of Hannaford supermarket a month later. Still, he declined to press charges even though his father wanted to sue me. For what, I don't know. There was no blood in this rock. 

But it could have been punishable by up to ten years in prison. Thankfully, Rowan slunk off to Durham, North Carolina, and I returned to cleaning cat shit out of abandoned houses. 

\*\*\*

Rowan was going to be my test case. I asked around town – remember, this was before social media and smartphones – and heard he'd graduated from Duke this past spring. He lived in Portland and was taking a gap year before law school. Must be nice.

There were some significant obstacles to pulling this off. I couldn’t just run up to him at Dunkin’ and jam a wad of cash in his hand.  

If I met him on the street and managed to get him to accept some of the money (and again, I’m not sure how I was going to pull that off exactly) and then he jumped in front of a bus, it was possible it would look like I pushed him. I certainly had motive. I wasn’t sure how any of this worked – would it be a heart attack, an aneurysm? Would he pull a Daley? 

The first thing I needed was deniability, and that started with a paper trail. I called the high school guidance office and said I was organizing a five-year reunion for the class of 1997. I found the name of Rowan and Cora’s class president in her yearbook and used that as cover. 

When I gave Chad Walker’s name, the guidance counselor asked me how Vassar had been, and I said great even though I had no idea who or what a Vassar was. I said I was missing a couple of contacts and was wondering if she could provide me with the e-mail addresses of a couple of alums. I mixed in a couple of other names from the class before getting to Rowan. She gladly gave me his AOL address. You've got mail, fucker. 

I wrote an e-mail to Rowan, and this is what it said:

*Dear Rowan:*

*I'm sure you don't want to hear from me, given how our last interaction went. But I'm trying to get some shit in order, and part of that includes apologizing to people I have hurt in some way. I was also cleaning out Cora’s room finally and have some letters to you that she wrote and some of her things I would like you to have. So I’d love to have lunch and connect so I can properly apologize to you in person. I heard you were living in Portland and would be happy to come that way.*

*Sincerely,* 

*Mitch* 

\*\*\*

He responded two days later. Back then, we weren’t checking our messages every five seconds. Most people had to dial-up, and it was a pain in the ass. His response was succinct:

*Fuck off*

I figured it was back to the drawing board for a test case, but a week later, he replied, unprompted:

*Is there something in those letters that I should be concerned about? I’d like to take care of this.*

I had him by the balls. He thought I was shaking him down over something in the letters that could make him look bad. I wasn't, but I played it coy and wrote back:

*I just want to talk.*

I hoped he'd interpret this as me being evasive. Five minutes later, he replied again:

*Where and when?*

\*\*\*

On Monday the tenth, I cruised down the Maine Turnpike toward South Portland. The leaves had not yet begun to change, but the sun was setting earlier, the warmth of each day slipping away as the shadows grew longer. My destination was a Pizza Hut by the Maine Mall. I had a hundred dollars in death cash in my pocket. 

I got there early, sat in a booth, and flipped through the jukebox at the table. I sipped a Coke from those red cups that looked like smoked glass but were industrial-grade plastic. This sounds like it was the fifties and not the early-2000’s now that I read it. Shit was just different before smartphones. 

Rowan came through the door, and I no longer had thirty pounds on him. His haircut looked like it cost more than the Kia. I stood up and extended my hand, but he didn't reciprocate. He sized me up with a scowl, then sat down across from me.

The waitress came over, and Rowan ordered water. I asked him if pepperoni was good, and he said it was. When the waitress left with our order, Rowan and I stared at each other. I wasn’t going to talk first. He eventually asked me how much. 

I told him I didn't want money. He asked what the fuck we were doing here then, and I told him that my e-mail was sincere. He said he thought this was a shakedown, and I wanted cash. 

I reached for the bench beside me and placed Cora's silver jewelry box on the table. I slid it over to him, and he hesitated, looking at it like it might be booby-trapped with a bomb. Eventually, he lifted the cover.

I sat silently as I watched him shuffle through the box's contents. Cora's class ring. Pictures of her and Rowan that they'd taken in the photo booth at the Fryeburg Fair. Then there were the letters, which Rowan had assumed contained something incriminating; perhaps they detailed his abuse or threats. 

He took one out and unfolded it, and as I watched him read, my pulse quickened, and I felt myself begin to sweat. I watched Rowan and saw his face twitch, his lips knitting themselves into a knot. He fought it, but soon his shoulders began heaving, and a tear trickled off the end of his nose and plopped on the lined paper.

I reached my hand into my pocket and felt the crisp bills. This was the part where I planned to pull out two twenties for the check and cram them in Rowan's hand. Tossing them on the table left the possibility that the waitress would snatch them up before Rowan laid a hand on them. I didn't need any more collateral damage than Laura and Daley. 

But as I stood up and looked at Rowan, wiping away the tears in each eye with a forefinger, I lost my nerve. I still hated him for what he did. I still do, to this day. But what I saw in him was genuine remorse. That probably sounds to you like I fancied myself the moral arbiter of the universe, but I didn't see someone who deserved to die. Not by my hand, anyway.

He had done all of those things, and he was sorry. That didn't make any of it ok, and it sure as shit didn't bring Cora back. He was a person – maybe even a bad one who had done horrible things. Someday he would have to answer for them, but it wouldn't be today. 

I slid out of the booth and reached into my other pocket. I pulled out a twenty and a ten from that pocket. The two bills were crumpled, not like the crisp death dollars. I tossed them down on the tabletop, and Rowan didn't look up. I mumbled *see ya around* to him, but I had no plans of that.

I started to turn away when I heard our waitress at the booth behind us. She was involved in an animated conversation with the two men seated there. She was speaking in that way 

Americans do when they encounter non-native speakers - loudly and with the cadence of a period after every word. *NO. THAT’S. NOT. ENOUGH.*

There were lots of *Sir, SIR*s thrown in. I turned slowly, drawn to their conversation. The two men seated at the table were arguing with the waitress over the bill. *No, you need another twenty* she said. 

The man with his back to me asked *ATM? ATM?* and the waitress told him there was one across the street at the Exxon station. I was about to turn to leave, unsure why I was invested in this inconsequential back and forth.

But then the man who was seated facing me looked up. He was light-skinned, and if I'd had to guess at that moment about his country of origin, I'd probably have been split between him being of Sicilian extraction, maybe from somewhere on the Iberian peninsula or the Middle East. 

But none of those thoughts crossed my mind because I was focused on his eyes. As he lifted his head, they seemed to bore into me. It's not an experience I ever had before that moment.

This wasn't some retroactive thing, either. I'm convinced of that. I didn't decide this later after seeing his face with all the others. The eyes that met mine were not human. They were dead, black, and evil.

I heard a crisp twenty crinkle in my fist as I squeezed it into a ball. I would hand it to the man with the evil eyes, a kind stranger helping him settle his bill. *Just give me that ten there,* I’d say. *There's no need to pay me back. Enjoy the Pine Tree State.*

You might think that after my reservations about killing pederasts and having just now taken a pass on Rowan Gorman, I wouldn't just pick out a stranger because his eyes made my balls crawl back up into my body. 

But that’s just what I did. Without thinking, I cut in front of the waitress and gave the man the twenty. He leaned back like he was trying to get away from me, the forwardness of this Ugly American off-putting. But he took the money in his hand, looked down at it curiously, then back up to me.

I pointed at the ten and took it from the table. I looked at the waitress and told her it was on me. She exhaled her thanks for defusing the situation. The man with the evil eyes understood, but his face remained blank. His partner smiled at me and said *thank you, my friend.* 

I stepped back and looked at the man with the twenty in his hand. I stood there, waiting. Expecting something to happen and waiting for what didn't come. Rowan was looking at me now, and so were the waitress, the two men, and the other patrons. 

I stared at the money in his hand and tried to will him dead. Work, dammit. Work. I waited for the massive stroke, the heart attack, or for him to pick up a knife and bury it in his neck. When those things didn't happen, I turned and ran out of the restaurant.

\*\*\*

I waited in my car with the engine running, watching the front doors of Pizza Hut. Two minutes later, the two men exited and walked toward a Nissan Altima with Massachusetts plates. As they moved across the parking lot, a thought struck me. 

The thought wasn't that it didn't work, that Laura and Daley had been a mere coincidence. Quite the contrary. What my mind landed on was that the thing was still very fucking real. 

These were the eyes of a man who had already accepted death. He had already embraced it, and his fate was decided. He was marked, and I could not untwist the knot of fate. 

But even with that knowledge – that soon he would be dead,  I felt my foot step on the gas pedal. Felt my four cylinders of fury groan as my balding tires spun forward. 

I gunned across the lot as the man closed on the Nissan, parked by itself. I pushed harder, the engine whining. He heard the noise, and maybe he saw the fury in my eyes as I bore down on him. 

I was going to run this fucker down, right here in the parking lot. He’d be dead, just as the universe had intended. 

But that's not what happened. The man dove out of the way at the last second, taking cover behind the bumper. I slammed on the brakes and skidded to a stop. I saw him get to his feet, cursing at me, gesticulating wildly, his friend pulling him back.

I saw those eyes in my rearview, and they were the eyes of the devil. 

\*\*\*

When I walked out of the apartment the next day, it was the kind of morning when you smell the air and realize it's getting colder. Sure, the sun would be high enough by late morning for you to work up a pretty good sweat. But the promise of winter is there. 

What I remember most is the azure color of the sky, how it was impossibly blue. The man with the eyes felt far away on a day as bright as this. 

Maybe you know by now how dark that day got. It was a day of fire and death. A day of evil. Two thousand nine hundred and sixty-six innocent people lost their lives. Nineteen others, these not-so-innocent, also died. 

Maybe you had the same thought I did a couple of days later when the FBI released their photos. Your gaze probably went to his face first. He was the ringleader, of course. You had the same thought, didn’t you? *Evil. Look at the evil.*

If he had died the night before, run down in the parking lot of a Pizza Hut, there is no question in my mind they would have aborted their mission. The leader was dead. Call it off.

How many more lives would have been spared if I could have finished the job? Not just that day, but in subsequent days, years, and decades?  

I think about that every day. I think about all the innocent people on those planes and in those buildings. And when I wake up in a sweat on a cold, dead night in January, I see those eyes and hear the screams of the people he burned alive.

\*\*\*

I made it out of that third-floor apartment. I went into the scrap metal business, which I suppose is a demo adjacent industry. I’ve been in the junk business y whole life. Now, I run one of the biggest scrap operations on the east coast, “Alloy, Matey!” You can Google it.

I've been fortunate to have a beautiful family - a loving wife and two little girls who make me laugh. I have a home on the coast of Maine and a place we go to in Florida. 

When I managed to make a little bit of money, I got some to Laura's grandmother, who raised her granddaughter. Enough for a good college and a down payment on a house, anyway. I did it anonymously because I didn't want anyone to know.

I'm not telling you this because I want the Rotary Club Citizen Of The Year award, but I want you to know I never forgot what I did. I've tried to live a good life, but I'm sure I failed a few times along the way.

I also have never forgotten what I failed to stop, and I vowed if I ever saw evil again, I would not fail. I've kept the money in a safe in my home office and never considered using it again. 

Remember how I told you it held sway over me and enraptured me? It still does. Not every day, but many of them. 

At night, when the rest of the house is asleep, I'll go into my office and take some of it out of the safe, rubbing my hands over it, feeling how crisp and new the bills feel. 

And I've never been tempted until today. I saw someone. Saw his eyes and got that same feeling down in my balls. I won't tell you who he is, but maybe you'll see it on the news. 

Now, I'm headed home, and I'm going to open that safe, rub my hands over the money, and figure out how I'll get it to him.
