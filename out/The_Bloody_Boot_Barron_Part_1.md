When I was young, around nine or ten, there was an old urban legend that passed around the playgrounds in my small town. It was basically about the ‘Bloody Boot Barron’ who would come in the night and bloody his boots on anyone he could find. I remember snickering about it every time I told a kid who had never heard it before. 

“He does….what?” 

Was all this new transfer student, Mikey, could muster upon hearing me reach the last parts of a story I completely made up about the Barron.

“Yeah. And then he stomps ya until his boots are all red with your bloooood.”

His face contorted in the middle of my sentence, the end to a story I had completely made up about this ghost. His eyes were wide like he was staring at a dead body as his mouth tightened into the deepest frown I had ever seen. I would never forget it because most kids our age had either already heard every scary campfire story about the Barron, or didn’t believe it when it first reached their ears. Mikey seemed to hang on my every word. 

“H-Have you ever seen him?”

He asked with baited breath, his chest heaving as he struggled to provide his brain with enough oxygen to not pass out right there.

“Ohhhhh yea, and when I did, I told him to screw off. Haven't seen him since.”

“Yeah right! Stop messing with me Allan!”

He had snapped out of his hyperventilation as I spoke. I remember hoping he would buy that part like he bought the rest of my stupid tale. I hoped that if he believed a story about a man visiting your house in the middle of the night to stomp you and your family to death that he would be gullible enough to believe I had encountered it before. Hope in one hand and crap in the other, I guess.

“No! I literallyy fought him off with my skills.”

I began making karate chop motions as we stood outside our school, where most kids waited for their parents to pick them up. At this point he was completely bought out of the entire story. 

“Whatever. Hey, do you walk too?”

He asked as he tightened a hand around one of his backpack straps that had previously been slipping off the slope of his shoulder as he stood straight, no longer enthralled by my tale. I stopped my Kill Bill impersonations and did the same to secure my bag on my back. 

“Yeah, actually. Which way do you go?”

He pointed behind me towards my street, and I grew excited because I didn’t really have a lot of friends at the time to be honest. I loved messing with people too much and most didn’t find it funny. I guess Mikey didn’t mind one bit.

“Same! Let’s walk together so the bloody boot-”

"You can’t get me with that again. I already know you made it all up.”

He said as his face showed how sick he was of my antics. I didn’t want to test my luck, so I let my smile temporarily disappear as I tried my best not to bring the barron up again on our entire walk. I just couldn’t get over his initial reaction, but I suppose I would never be able to capture that kind of lightning in a bottle ever again. 

It turned out we lived on the same street, his house was the one I had seen moving vans outside of a few houses down and across the street last week, before school started. On the short walk we talked about what kind of video games we were into, his mom had just gotten him Crash Bandicoot, and my dad was renting me one of the original Ghost Recon games at the time. We talked about bringing our PlayStations over to each other's houses to play together and then parted ways at my house as it came up. I waved him goodbye.

My dad worked late most days, so since school started up I had been letting myself in with a spare key he left for me under a rock near our front door. I probably would’ve been doing it sooner if I stepped outside at all during the summer, but I enjoyed spending my time with video games and TV. My mom was never present in my life, and my dad never really liked to talk about it. Anytime I brought her up he would wave me off and reach for the fridge to grab one of his “special drinks”. 

I would usually have started up the TV after finishing my homework and grabbing a snack, but on the same day I made my first friend, I found an interesting-looking book waiting for me on the coffee table. Figured my dad had gotten it for me so I wouldn’t spend so much time in front of the TV anymore. Looking back though, it was such a short book so that theory didn’t make much sense. It was two pages enclosed between a hard cover that was a dark brown leather, front and back. The thing that really caught my attention at the time though, was the symbol on the front. It was a red symbol that looked like six triangles stacked in a pyramid formation. The book itself wasn’t thick, but still large. Shaped like a kids' book in a large square, as though it was making room for pictures to paint the pages that it contained. 

Upon opening the book, I was greeted with the first page, mostly blank with only a few lines of words. I will never forget what they said because they became my mantra to torment Mikey for the coming years. 

>*The Barron comes, just wait and see.*

>*He comes for all who know of he.*

>*He paints the walls, he paints the floors.*

>*He paints his boots with blood and more.*

>*Pay the price when he comes at night.*

>*Or you’ll pay with more than just your life.*

Upon turning the page, I was greeted with a rough-looking sketch of a man's smiling face. He was bearded and donned an old fancy-looking hat that covered his eyes. It kinda creeped me out upon seeing it for the first time, so I slammed the book shut and placed it back on the table where I found it before walking towards the TV where I plopped down in front of it and turned it on. I pretty much sat there watching cartoons until my dad came home. 

“Hey buddy, how was school?”

He entered the house and spoke as he shut the door and locked it behind him. He placed his keys in the bowl on a stand near the door, then stood waiting for my response. My neck craned backwards so I would face him and I smiled as I barked my response. 

“It was great! I made friends with the kid who just moved in down the street, and I got to trick him with the Barron story!”

My dad's smile disappeared as his eyes sank and left my contact. He sauntered towards the kitchen as he removed his coat and draped it over his Lay-Z-Boy recliner next to the couch. He didn’t utter another word as he left the room and I heard the fridge open and close. I decided to stand up and yell to him from the living room, hoping I hadn’t completely ruined his mood in some way.

“Oh… and what's with this book you got me?”

I semi-shouted as I stood there. I heard the sort of crack a soda can makes when opened and had to wait a few seconds before he responded.

“What book?”

My eyes darted to the coffee table I had found and left it on but it was nowhere to be seen. My confusion compiled as I struggled to think of when I had moved it. I had gotten up to go pee maybe twice since I got home and one of those times was before I read the book and sat myself in front of the TV. I don’t remember ever moving it or touching it after my initial finding.

“Uhh. It was on the table, it had the poem about the Barron? And the pictur-”

I was cut off by the sound of loud stomping as he re-entered the living room swiftly and sternly. His eyes immediately locked on the table for moments before matching mine. 

“So you read it?”

His eyes began to swell and gloss over with incoming tears. His bottom lip seemed to quiver as well but I figured at the time I had been imagining things.

“Y-yea, it looked cool. And short.”

My hands began to fiddle with each other, fingers weaving in between each other as I sensed I had done something wrong. My words broke the dam holding back his surfacing emotions and silent tears began to swell down his face as he rushed towards me and crouched down to wrap his arms around my torso in a tight grip. He began sobbing into my shoulder as I returned the firm hug. 

“I’m so sorry Allan. So, so, sorry.” 

Those were the only words I could make out between his sad moans and sobbing. My confusion left me dumbfounded as I hugged my father back and I said the only words that echoed in my mind.

“What’s wrong? Am I in trouble?”

He loosened his grip and pulled himself back, still kneeling. Wiping his tears from his eyes and cheeks as he sniffled. 

“We can talk about it later, okay? You can go back to your show while I make dinner. You haven’t eaten yet have you?”

I shook my head and he stood up, still wiping tears.

“I’ll fix somethin’ to eat then we’ve gotta get you to bed. Sorry about this bud.”

My body was frozen, I watched my dad try to find his composure as he hobbled back into the kitchen. I had seen my dad cry many times before, he often sat at the foot of his bed crying with his door cracked in the middle of the night as I got up to go to the bathroom or get some water. I always figured it had something to do with mom, but he never wanted to talk about it, and I had no memories of her, so I didn’t really share in his grief. Now, he cried the most I had ever seen over the mere mention of some book that I couldn’t find. Mikey was never gonna believe this.

I awoke the next morning to the sound of my alarm clock blaring, 7 am on the dot. I wandered down my hallway and noticed my dad still passed out in his bed, fully clothed and on top of all his blankets and covers. This was common. I made myself some cereal and got myself dressed for school before I heard a knock on the door as I grabbed my backpack. Opening the door revealed Mikey, clutching his lunch box in one hand and the left strap of his bag in the other.  

“Hey, wanna walk together again?”

“Yea! I’ve gotta tell you about something I found last night too.”

I shouted a goodbye to my passed-out father and slammed the door shut after locking the bottom handle lock. During our walk I told Mikey all about the book I found, my dad’s reaction to it, and finally the poem that resided in its pages. Word for word. 

“You can’t scare me with that Barron story anymore.”

He seemed bored, not the reaction I was hoping for.

“No, I’m being one hundred percent for real. My dad literally said sorry after I told him about it. I think he might know about the Barron!"

Mikey continued to look like I was giving him a calculus lecture, bored to the bone. 

“Whatever you say, I’m not letting you get me with that again.”

We made it to school, changing the topic to video games, and parted ways at the front to make our way to our respective classes. The rest of that school day was entirely uneventful, just a regular day. Until my walk home with Mikey. 

“You SUCK at tag!” 

Mikey mocked me for my poor performance during our shared recess. He wasn’t wrong, I spent most of my time being it. 

“Whatever, I could stommmp you in four-square.”

I did, in fact, take pride in my four-square skills, them being much more real than my supposed karate skills. 

“Oh yea? How about we see who can get through Medal of Honor on the hardest difficulty first and then the-”

His reply was cut off by a loud bell ringing. It was the type of bell that should be hanging high in a church tower, but its ear-piercing ring resonated in my head as though the bell was sitting right behind me. I recoiled and halted my steady pace as my hands reflexively reached for my head to comfort it. The bell didn’t cease its ringing until it had let off three loud and deep chimes. It's sound filled my entire head. I couldn't hear my own thoughts. 

“Hey…Allan?...Allan?...Are you okay?!”

Mikey's words finally managed to reach me as the last ring of the bell slowly faded out of my skull. 

“You didn’t hear that?”

I was catching my breath that I hadn’t realized I was holding the entire time those sounds echoed through my mind. My face must’ve stank of genuine concern and confusion. 

“...just the weird sounds you were making.”

“What sounds? You didn't hear that bell!?” 

“No bell, just your weird noises, they were like UGHHH and OHHHH.”

A smile shot across his face as he began to mimic the groans and grunts I must’ve been making as my head filled with the sounds of the bell.

“Shut upp, I did not sound like that.”

I was slightly annoyed that I was the only one affected by the loudest sound I had ever heard. I began to feel like one of those crazy people in all the scary movies that came on late at night. 

“You literally did, I thought you were gonna drop dead right there.”

He continued to mock my previous fit as we walked our way home. When we got to our street, I noticed my dad’s car in the driveway. I guess he got home early today. I’d finally be able to get some help on my homework, I thought. I parted ways with Mikey as he continued to mock my noises and poses I took during the ringing that now permeated my thoughts. I gave him a fake finger, the thing where you flip your ring finger up at someone for a split second so it looks like a middle finger, and I ran up to my steps and tried to run inside as quickly as possible. The door was locked to my surprise, so I used the usual key under the rock and made my way inside after placing the spare back under the door. 

“Daaaaaad, I’m homee.”

I shouted the greeting as I tossed my backpack onto the couch. There was no response, so I figured he was in the bathroom. The bathroom was straight at the end of the hallway, with a perfect view of its door when you reach the entryway of the hallway. It was empty, the light off and the door open. 

“Dad? I saw your car outside, so you can’t try and scare me. I know you’re here…”

I said as I was already scared and growing more so, he was usually pretty quick to greet me and ask me about my day. But the silence that currently filled our house was deafening, his car insinuated his presence, but it was nowhere to be found. Unless this was some game. Maybe he was hiding with a surprise gift? Maybe he was gonna pop out of a closet and surprise me with a trip to eat out at a restaurant tonight? Something we hadn’t done in years. 

I reached his bedroom door, which was completely closed for once, and opened it. I found nothing inside, an empty room with a perfectly made bed. I wandered to my room, then double checked the bathroom, then checked the kitchen and living room once again all in search of him to no avail. I ended up in the kitchen once again, flabbergasted. I sat at the table and first noticed a chair missing from our table, there were usually four. Then something in our backyard, like an additional branch to the tree that had sat there for as long as I could remember. I made my way towards the back door and opened it only to be greeted by yet another scene I would never forget for as long as I lived. My father, dangling by his neck only a few feet from the ground from a rope that was tied around the thickest branch on the tree. 

I immediately dialed 9-1-1 on our landline and told the operator what I found while unsuccessfully fighting back tears. It took the police and ambulance long enough to arrive for me to wander back to the scene, still spewing tears and snot, and to find a note he had stuck under a rock near his feet and the chair he had undoubtedly used to prop himself up. Him and putting things under rocks. I still have the note to this day and it reads as follows;

>*I am so sorry Allan, I still don’t know if I made the right choice. A choice you will have to make one day. Unless you don’t have kids, DON’T HAVE ANY CHILDREN. Don’t make the same mistake I did. Or else you will have to choose. There are no right answers. No right choices. Either way the guilt will kill you. You will end up like me. I love you.* 

I am glad I didn’t throw his mad scribbles away at the time, I wanted to so badly. When the emergency responders arrived I was whisked away to my front yard all the way to the sidewalk as they proceeded to clean up my dad’s mess and try to comfort me. It wasn’t long before the sirens shone outside my house before Mikey ran out towards me with his mom following behind. 

“Allan! What happened?”

My tear-stained face and quivering lip seemed to be all he needed. He sat down beside me and offered a hug as I began to sob loudly. His mom followed suit in pajamas and a bathrobe and sat down on my other side with one arm reaching around us both in a comforting embrace. 

“He’s gone, I don't have anyone else.” 

I said through broken gasps and steady tears. I was scared for my future, scared of what would happen to me now that my only remaining parent had decided to leave me all on my own.

“Alla-”

Mikey was interrupted by his mom as she wrapped her other arm around us both, embracing us completely now. Her next words offered me more comfort than I would ever feel for the rest of my life so far. 

“Shhhh, it's gonna be okay honey. Don’t worry yourself one bit. It’s all gonna be okay.”
