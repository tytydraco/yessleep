So far, nothing has been really out of the ordinary for me. As a youngster from the United States, my family and I traveled to a Southeast Asian country to see some relatives of my mother's. Although I had intended to go back to the United States for college, I couldn't bear to abandon my younger siblings so I stayed here with my parents when they retire. This strange land has increased their demand for me.

I'm a third-year student at a Catholic institution, and I'm in the Honors Program for Economics. A regular get-together of Econ students took place last week when we held a consortium with a nearby school. One man, however, stuck out among the typical small talk and networking. Some of his classmates were making fun of him, and they were laughing all around him. But it seems he was unconcerned. A stunning woman was the object of his heated conversation. There was something odd about her, despite her beautiful face and long dark hair. Every time I cast an eye their way, a shiver went down my spine, like if something sinister were hiding beneath her grin.

I went to sit down with my classmates for lunch as he sat alone with that female. I wanted to ease the tension by waving for them to join us, as we were the hosts. Astoundingly, they consented, and the man stomped over while the girl glided almost ethereally at his side.

"Oh my God, that guy is such a weirdo," murmured a girl from my class after lunch. The man can't stop babbling to himself. With uncomfortable laughs, everyone nodded in accord. In the pit of my stomach, a knot formed. Rather than seeming strange, he gave off the impression that he was desperately clinging to something. I also realized, nobody else but he and I can see her.

I noticed the girl he was talking to, and when I motioned for them to come over to join us, she seemed stunned, as if nobody had noticed them. She hesitated before casting a glance at him as she indicated to herself. In an effort to push aside the growing sense of discomfort, I merely nodded.

I noticed the girl's hungry eyes dart around the room as they took their seats. A chill went down my spine despite its subtlety. He continued talking, his voice fluctuating in lively bursts, and she listened with an unnerving intensity.

As soon as lunch was over, I did my best to dismiss the uneasy sense that something was amiss. But I kept thinking about them that night. In an effort to decipher the man's peculiar conduct, I combed the web for any and all details regarding him. On the contrary, I happened into a forum that was specifically for weird occurrences. Strange encounters with enigmatic beings that appeared to exist on the cusp of reality were the stuff of fantastical tales.

A story about a stunning woman who had been attracting male suitors from even before or at the time the Spaniards came to these lands, Mariang Makiling. Captivated by her charm, her victims would vanish.

The events of that day continue to haunt me with an eerie sense of unease. I don't know the girl's true identity or her goals, but I feel the need to maintain my distance from her now, lest I be just another name in a story or another lost soul in this unfamiliar world.
