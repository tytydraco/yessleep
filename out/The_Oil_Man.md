In the town of Clearview, one must always be mindful of the rules. Mind you, the rules aren't written anywhere. We just all know to tip the water delivery guy in odd dollar increments, or to never run the sprinklers on days that start with "t". It's just the *way things are.* Life in Clearview runs smoothly when everyone follows the rules. And even when they don't, it usually works out in the end.

Take the *Oil* Man, for instance. Every adult in Clearview knows what to do when the Oil Man knocks on their door.

When I was eight years old, my father called me into the living room after a knock on the door.

"Eliot," he said, beckoning me to sit down on the couch. "The Oil Man is here. I want you to watch how I talk to him."

Dad opened the door and there stood a tall man in a gray suit jacket. He wore a pork-pie hat and had a gold chain hanging from his jacket pocket.

"Good afternoon, sir," the Oil Man said, his voice soft yet firm. "Checking to see if your fuel oil tank needs refilling."

"Let me take a look," said my dad, turning and heading into the basement.

As my dad was downstairs, the Oil Man stood in the doorway motionless. His eyes were fixed forward, and his body unflinching. Within moments, Dad was back in the doorway.

"Not this time," he said. "We're still at three-quarters."

"Alright," replied the Oil Man, "I'll come back in a little while."

"Appreciated," said my dad, giving the Oil Man's hand a firm shake.

The Oil Man turned to leave, and my dad shut the door.

"It's as easy as that," Dad said to me. "Always answer the door, check the oil level downstairs, tell him it's at three-quarters, shake his hand. That's all you have to do when the Oil Man comes around."

"Where do you go to check the oil tank?" I asked. "And what if it's not at three-quarters?"

"Eliot," my dad said sternly, "we heat with natural gas. We don't have an oil tank."

But from that day, the Oil Man would visit every few months, and each time my dad would have me watch their discussion. It's how we kids in Clearview learned the rules, after all.

It wasn't until I was much older, maybe fifteen, that I had to interact with the Oil Man alone for the first time. It was winter break from school, and my parents were both working when I heard a knock on the door. I saw the Oil Man's pork-pie hat through the door's upper window and ran the steps through my mind.

*Check the oil level downstairs. Tell him it's at three-quarters. Shake his hand.*

I opened the door and there he was, wearing the same clothes he had worn the first time I saw him and every time since., not looking a day older.

"Good afternoon, sir. Checking to see if your fuel oil tank needs refilling."

"I'll go check," I replied, and I walked down into the basement. It felt silly to be checking on something that didn't exist, but after a suitable amount of time, I returned to the front door.

"We're still at three-quarters," I said.

"Alright, I'll come back in a little while."

"Appreciated," I said, closing the door.

The sound of the door closing jolted my mistake to mind.

*You forgot to shake his hand!*

I flung the door open, but the Oil Man was gone. Sprinting out onto the front porch, I looked around to see if I could find him. But he was nowhere to be seen.

I panicked.

*Oh no. Oh no. What do I do now?*

Dad never told me what happened if you got the interaction wrong. Or how to fix it. Everything appeared perfectly normal as I made my way back into the living room. Having lived in Clearview for my whole life, though, I knew this misstep wouldn't go without a consequence. But I was fifteen. I would do what I could to figure it out on my own.

I walked around the house, checking each room for anything out of the ordinary.

Living room, fine. My bedroom, fine. Mom and Dad's bedroom, bathroom, closets- everything just as it should have been.

But as I searched, an unsettling thought crept into my mind. If something were to be *wrong,* it would be in the basement.

With a trembling hand, I reached out and turned the knob, opening the basement door. The dim incandescent light revealed only the gray concrete floor at the terminus of the wooden stairs below. Step by rickety step, I descended into the basement, holding my breath as the dingy space came into view.

Letting my breath out with a sigh, I was relieved to find everything as it should be. There was only one more spot to check.

Around a small concrete outcropping sat the furnace. A big part of me wanted to turn around and head upstairs, sure that I had checked *thoroughly enough.* But my fear of the unknown won out over my fear of whatever I may have caused by my mistake.

Silently, I tip-toed farther into the basement, the single lightbulb flickering overhead. I took a wide path, keeping as much distance as I could between me and the furnace nook. But no distance could have prepared me for the Oil Man.

First, an arm came into view. Sleeved in that gray jacket and stiff at his side.

I wanted to turn around then, but found myself compelled to see his face.

When the Oil Man came into full view, enveloped in shadow, all I could think of was the first time I ever saw him standing at our front door- when my dad left the room for that brief moment. The Oil Man stood there, tall and stiff, staring straight ahead, unmoving.

His face was blank, his mouth slightly agape.

And as I beheld him, a ticking noise sounded from his direction, growing louder by the second. The gold chain from his breast pocket held up a golden pocket-watch which hung motionless down to his belt.

As the ticking grew louder, I risked a word.

"Excuse—"

He moved.

At the sound of my voice, the Oil Man snapped his head in my direction, his face still blank.

Our eyes met, and instantly I was somewhere else. Plunged in darkness, a screeching noise in my ears.

Hunched over, I couldn't stand. I threw my hands out to either side, where they clanged against rusty metal with a hollow thud. The smell of fuel oil permeated my nose, filling my lungs. A lukewarm liquid rose to just below my shoulders. I could hardly breathe enough to scream, but managed a muffled moan as my thrashing agitated the liquid in which I stood.

Just as quickly as I was there, I was back, standing in the basement— the Oil Man no longer looking in my direction.

I ran, fast as my legs would carry me up the stairs. Away from the Oil Man, away from the deafening ticking.

Out of the basement, all was quiet again.

In the light, I surveyed my clothing, expecting to be drenched in fuel oil. But nothing.

Catching my breath, I thought of what to do next—coming up with nothing. But I couldn't stay in that house.

Grabbing my coat, I headed for the front door.

I didn't register the ticking, growing louder as I turned the knob.

He was there.

Stiff, still, staring at me.

In a flash, the screeching filled my ears once more. I was back in the oil tank. But this time, the oil level was even higher. I had to bend my neck to keep my face above the viscous oil. I couldn't keep from panicking. But my movements only filled my gasping mouth with the bitter liquid.

Just as I thought I'd die, trapped in that metallic hell, I found myself back in the living room—the front door now closed.

I dashed to the phone and called my dad.

"I forgot to shake the Oil Man's hand!" I blurted, before he could even say *hello.*

"It will be okay," my dad said, worry in his voice. "Don't move. Keep your eyes closed; I'll be right home."

I sat down on the kitchen floor in front of the phone, still trembling from my experience. My eyes were clenched shut, though every few minutes, I heard the ticking noise start up again from down in the basement.

Before long, I heard my dad pull into the driveway and get out of the car. The front door opened.

"I'm here, Eliot," he said. "You can open your eyes."

"Dad… he's in here." I replied, peeking through my wincing eyelids.

"I know, son. We'll take care of it."

Dad stepped into the kitchen, pulled me up from the floor and reached on top of the fridge for the phone book. Finding the page he was looking for, he muttered, "Budget's kind of tight for this…"

He picked up the phone and dialed. All I could hear was my dad's side of the call.

"Hello, Henry?… It's William Parker… I'm doing alright, thanks… Well, my son forgot to shake the Oil Man's hand… Yup… You can come today?… Great. See you soon."

He hung up the phone and sat down.

"What was that?" I asked.

"Henry Lawson runs the HVAC place in town. He's going to come by and install a fuel oil tank. It's the only way to make him leave."

Mr. Lawson was at our home within an hour, and our house was equipped with its very own fuel oil tank. And though we still heated with natural gas, from that day on I could honestly tell the Oil Man our oil tank was three-quarters full.

I escaped that day mostly unscathed. But for years to come, I could never quite wash off the subtle smell of fuel oil that followed me wherever [I went](https://www.reddit.com/r/MattBenjamin/).
