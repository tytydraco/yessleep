I always knew there was something rotten in Hollywood. The whispers of corruption, the sinister shadows cast by its brightest stars. But nothing could have prepared me for what lay beneath the glamorous façade. Fame, fortune, and critical acclaim were my companions, but with success came an invitation to a world so twisted, so horrifying, that it threatened to consume my very soul.

Let me back up a bit. For safety purpose I will briefly introduce myself without any names. I'm the director behind some of the most celebrated films of the past decade. I've had the privilege of working with the finest actors in the world, creating cinematic masterpieces that have captivated audiences globally. I’ve won an Oscar, basked in the glory of standing ovations at film festivals, and watched my name climb the heights of the Hollywood Hills, etched in gold. My movies have grossed millions, and my vision has shaped the modern landscape of film. To the outside world, I was living the dream, the very embodiment of success.

Yet, even with all that acclaim, there was always a nagging feeling that there was more, something lurking beneath the surface of Hollywood’s glitzy veneer. It started innocuously enough—a lavish party at a mansion in the Hollywood Hills. The kind of event where deals were made over champagne and caviar, where the elite mingled and smiled with practiced ease. But beneath the surface, there was a palpable tension, a current of something dark and primal. It was there that I first heard about Bohemian Grove.

At first, it sounded like an exclusive retreat for the rich and powerful—a place where they could unwind, away from prying eyes. But the more I listened, the more I realized this was no ordinary gathering. There were hushed whispers about rituals, sacrifices, and pacts with dark forces. Intrigued and a little frightened, I accepted the invitation, not knowing that I was about to step into a nightmare.

Bohemian Grove was nestled deep in the redwoods, far from civilization. As I arrived, I was struck by the sheer opulence of the place. But there was an undercurrent of dread, a sense that this place was steeped in ancient, malevolent power. The first night, I witnessed a spectacle that would be burned into my mind forever.

Celebrities, politicians, and business magnates gathered around a massive bonfire. The air was thick with the smell of burning wood and something else—something metallic and sharp. The rituals began with chanting, a language that sent chills down my spine. And then, the debasement started.

Famous actors, the idols of millions, were stripped of their dignity. Public humiliation was the order of the night. I watched in horror as they debased themselves for the promise of more fame, more power. Some engaged in group sex on stage, their faces contorted in grotesque masks of pleasure and pain. Others ate feces, their eyes hollow and desperate.

The worst were the sacrifices. I saw people kill their own family members in front of a cheering crowd. The bloodlust was palpable, a frenzy that fed on itself. I saw men and women allow themselves to be mutilated, their bodies violated with knives, broken bottles, and cigarettes. All for the promise of eternal fame. The boundaries between pleasure and pain, ecstasy and agony, blurred into a nightmarish tableau.

But it was the supernatural occurrences that truly terrified me. Shadows moved on their own, whispers echoed in the dark, and figures flickered at the edges of my vision. At one point, I saw a woman levitate, her body writhing in the air as if possessed by a demonic force. I saw fires that burned with an unnatural intensity, casting flickering, eldritch light on the proceedings. The air itself seemed to pulse with malevolence, a living thing that fed on the suffering and depravity.

Each time I attended the Grove, it got worse. The rituals grew more grotesque, the supernatural phenomena more pronounced. I began to fear for my sanity, for my soul. The things I saw, the things I heard—no amount of fame or fortune was worth this descent into madness.

One night, as I watched a particularly gruesome ritual, I felt a hand on my shoulder. It was one of the high priests, his eyes glinting with a predatory intelligence. "You could have all of this. You could be more than just a director. You could be a god."

I recoiled, my stomach turning. "No," I said, my voice trembling. "I don't want any part of this."

His smile was cold and knowing. "Everyone has a price," he said. "You just haven't found yours yet."

I fled that night, vowing never to return. But i did…

There's a particular night that stands out among the horrors I witnessed at Bohemian Grove. The air was thick with tension, an almost palpable electricity that set my nerves on edge. The usual debasements were already in full swing, but there was an added element of fear in the eyes of the participants. Something big was about to happen.

The high priest stepped forward, raising his hands to silence the crowd. "Tonight," he announced, his voice echoing through the dark forest, "we honor the Old Ones with a ritual of ascension."

A hush fell over the crowd as a group of young children was led to the center of the clearing. Their eyes were wide with terror, their small bodies trembling. The sight of them made my blood run cold. I had heard whispers of child sacrifices, but I had never believed them to be true. This was a line even the most depraved among us had never crossed.

The children were placed in a circle around the bonfire, their hands bound with thick ropes. The chanting began, low and guttural, resonating deep within my chest. The high priest held a ceremonial dagger, its blade glinting in the firelight. As he approached the first child, a boy no older than seven, I felt a surge of nausea.

"No," I whispered, my voice lost in the growing chant. "This can't be happening."

The dagger descended, and the boy's scream pierced the night. Blood flowed freely, soaking into the ground, and the crowd erupted in a frenzy of cheers and jeers. One by one, the children were sacrificed, their innocent lives snuffed out for the sake of power and fame. The air grew thick with the stench of blood and burning flesh, and the ground seemed to tremble beneath my feet.

As you can imagine, there were even worse things happening with the kids—things that Hollywood is known for, but for obvious reasons, I won’t describe them in this Reddit post.

But it wasn't over. As the last child's lifeless body was thrown into the fire, the chanting reached a fever pitch. The flames roared higher, their color shifting to an unnatural, sickly green. Shadows twisted and writhed within the fire, taking on monstrous forms. I saw faces in the flames, contorted with rage and hunger.

The high priest turned to the crowd, his eyes glowing with an unholy light. "Behold," he cried, "the ascension is upon us!"

The ground split open with a deafening crack, and a darkness unlike anything I had ever seen poured forth. It was as if the very essence of evil had been unleashed. Figures emerged from the chasm, their forms shifting and melting like shadows given life. They were the Old Ones, the ancient gods of chaos and destruction.

The crowd fell to their knees, their eyes wide with awe and terror. The Old Ones moved among them, touching their heads, their chests. Those they deemed worthy were consumed by the darkness, their screams echoing through the night. Those who were not simply vanished, their existence erased in an instant.

I stood frozen, unable to move or look away. One of the Old Ones approached me, its eyes burning with an otherworldly fire. It reached out a hand, and I felt a coldness seep into my bones. For a moment, I saw my entire life laid out before me, every choice, every mistake. And then it spoke, its voice a whisper in my mind.

"Run."

The word snapped me out of my trance. I turned and fled, the sounds of the ritual fading behind me. I ran through the forest, branches tearing at my clothes and skin. I didn't stop until I reached my car, throwing myself inside and speeding away from that cursed place.

I never spoke of what I saw that night. But the memories haunt me, a constant reminder of the darkness that lurks beneath Hollywood's glamorous surface. The price of fame is not measured in dollars or awards, but in souls. And some prices are too high to pay.

Months after my last visit to Bohemian Grove, I tried to put it all behind me. I buried myself in work, hoping to drown out the memories with the mundane routines of directing. But the nightmares persisted, growing more vivid and more terrifying with each passing night. I was haunted by the faces of the children, their eyes pleading for mercy, and the unholy glow of the Old Ones.

One night, I received a package. It was unmarked, left on my doorstep. Inside was a DVD, labeled with a single word: "Proof." My hands trembled as I inserted it into my player. The screen flickered to life, showing grainy footage of the rituals I had witnessed. Every horrific detail was captured, from the debasement of the actors to the final sacrifice of the children.

And then, the camera turned. It showed the faces of those in the crowd, their expressions twisted with ecstasy and terror. I recognized many of them—celebrities, politicians, business magnates. But the camera lingered on one face in particular: mine. I watched in horror as I saw myself, eyes wide with fear, standing among the depraved throng.

A note fell from the DVD case. It read, "You can run, but you cannot hide. The Grove will always find you."

Panic gripped me as I hastily packed a bag and fled my home. Now, I am dedicating myself to writing books, keeping as far away from Hollywood and the United States as possible. These events have driven me back to religion, which has been my anchor, helping me maintain my sanity.



\[Edit: Money and fame don’t matter. I’ve had it all—Ferraris, Lamborghinis, huge villas, beautiful girls, and more money than I could ever spend. But why do you think all these celebrities turn to drugs, soulless sex, wild parties, and alcohol? It’s because that’s how they try to work out their trauma of what they had to do to get there. Behind the glamour and the flashing lights, there’s a darkness that consumes. The price of fame is paid in nightmares and broken souls, and no amount of wealth or luxury can ever fill the void left by the horrors endured to achieve it.\]
