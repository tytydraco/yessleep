I’m using my ghost-hunter friend’s computer while he’s sleeping, so hopefully he can’t figure out what I’m doing. If you are reading this, though **(Dennis’ Note: I am)**, make sure your cat doesn’t mess with the salt lines around your computer. You’re slipping **(Dennis’ Note: Just because you put tuna near the salt lines so he’d walk through it doesn’t mean I’m slipping).**

I’ll introduce myself first, then explain why I’m here.

My name is Chase Knight. I was born in no-where, Kentucky, and have frequented this subreddit for a few years, though I haven’t posted anything before now. I was never the creative one in my friend group. Growing up my dad was a baseball fanatic, so the first thing I learned once I could walk was how to swing a small foam bat. My mom has never let him forget that, though I think she feels they’re even after all of the bruises I gave my dad when I learned how to hit real balls. I never approached writing projects in school with disdain, but I never felt the spark that my creative friends did; that irresistible urge to start drawing, writing, *doing*, your thoughts transforming into the mind of someone else or into strings of shapes and colors begging to be woven together (**Dennis’ Note: One of your creative friends write them big fancy words for you?)**. Given the circumstances though, I think anyone would want to get their thoughts down. I don’t have any time to waste. Writing is one of the only ways I can reassure myself that I exist now, and I want my last words to be read by more than this codger.

I would like to think that someone smarter than me would have seen the signs about our tenth grade field trip to Washington D.C. and refused to go. However, I didn’t realize anything was wrong until our bus sputtered to a halt in the middle of nowhere. My head rapped against the already uncomfortable window, and I groaned as I woke. The world was still pitch black outside, though my eyes had adjusted to the darkness since I’d slept. Phones glowed like tiny stars from some of the other seats, illuminating the faces of my classmates so they looked like holograms. Next to me Travis, my friend since I’d given him a pushing start on the swings in first grade, glanced over at me stirring. He had never been able to sleep in the car, and had huge bags under his brown eyes. I’m not sure if he was too sleep deprived to speak clearly or if I was still in a haze from waking, but I found myself mutely returning his dull stare as he tried to explain what was going on until I winced at the sting of cold air against my cheek. Looking around, I saw my classmates standing at their seats and reluctantly being ushered into the chilly air and was compelled to do the same. I found myself pleasantly surprised to see a girl with a brunette pixie-cut standing at the seat diagonal from mine.

“Oh, hey Gabbie.”

The brunette glanced over her shoulder before turning with a smile. “Hey, Chase. I knew it was you snoring behind me, even if I couldn’t see you.” She chuckled. “You still sound like that ancient tuba from Mrs. Farris’ band class.”

I rolled my eyes good-humoredly. “You only remember that because it was the only year you were in the band. I bet you still have that rented saxophone.”

“Like my parents would want that thing anyway near me!” Gabbie squealed, only to be shushed by one of the chaperones. I lowered my voice. “So what happened? Rest stop?”

Gabbie shook her head as she stepped into the bus aisle. “No. I think we got a flat tire.”

“I could drive better than this idiot,” Travis grumbled as he followed her, a throw-blanket wrapped tightly around his shoulders. I made a noncommittal grunt of agreement, then followed my friends outside.

The cold air was no less oppressive out in the open, a sharp breeze rustling the corn stalks surrounding us on either side of the road. Mist settled around my feet, and large tendrils rose to the sky from patches in the field where corn had already died, looking like a dozen smoldering fires.

“I wish those were all real fires,” I muttered as I joined Travis at the edge of the group of students, shuffling from foot to foot to stay warm. “I’m freezing.”

“No shit,” Travis replied with feeling. “You think they got a spare tire?”

I shrugged my shoulders doubtfully, searching for one of the chaperones to ask, when I heard a low snarling from the cornfield beside me.

In an instant, the roadside erupted in chaos. Five dogs three times the size of any canine I’d ever seen pounded out of the field near the front of the bus. As one they turned towards the group of students and advanced, none of them losing stride as their slathering jowls drew back. They fell onto the bus driver first, and out of the corner of my eyes I saw Travis’ face twist in regret at his previous words. “Come on-'' he rapsed in horror, grabbing my wrist and yanking me around the back of the bus. The motion was enough for my mind to register the faces of my classmates who were still stricken with fear. “Alex! Derrick! Move your asses!” I bellowed, and was relieved to see the two join the crowd of students stampeding for the bus door.

The pack made quick work of the bus driver. I could hear a frenzy of wild barking as they fought over the pieces, then their paws scrabbling intently against the asphalt. My classmates were still slowly funneling onto the bus in a manic whirlwind of pushing and shoving, so I turned and started beating against the nearest window with a baseball I had forgotten to take out of my hoodie. My ears rang as I watched the beasts make their way along the windows on the other side of the bus, then disappear. The flow of my classmates abruptly stopped, and I didn’t have to look to know that one of the students had closed the bus door and was refusing to let anyone else inside to save themselves.

The remaining students scattered into the cornfields as the dogs fell on us. Travis had let go of me as we wrestled through the crowd, and I prayed he’d made it on the bus. I saw a glimpse of Gabbie as she trampled through the cornstalks and bolted after her, tuning out the screams of my dying classmates.

I don’t remember what happened after that.

Since then I’ve been wandering as a spirit, at first trying to find my classmates, then desperately searching for anyone who could sense my presence. Unfortunately for me, that person is unquestionably the oldest, most spiteful asshole I’ve ever met **(Dennis’ Note: Hilarious. I’m a peach)**.

The first time my voice came across Dennis Thompson’s three dollar ghost listening device, he turned it off. When I flicked the switch back to the on position and tried again, he pressed a wrinkled finger into the switch to keep it in the off position. My laughter nearly burst the speakers after I blew air at his nose and managed to get the listening device back on as he sneezed. By the fifth round of our battle of wills, he went to start digging through a drawer filled with tools. I impulsively grabbed the device and did my best impression of Darth Vader while bobbing the flimsy plastic up and down. “This is your father speaking. Do as I say and-” I was cut off as the old man sprayed me with a squirt bottle. The spray was the first sensation I’d felt since I’d died, and I was too shocked to retaliate. I remained stupefied as my figure began to glow a soft blue color, and I distinguished the faded band shirt I’d had on when I died, though enormous gashes were torn across both it and my jeans “What was that?” I sputtered, my voice still warbling out of the listening device’s speaker. “Why can I see myself now? And how can this dumb thing hear me?”

The old man frowned. “I made that device myself, you ungrateful rootworm. You’re lucky I’ve been wantin’ to find spirits around here. Now, who the hell are you?”

I quickly told the man my name, and he ungraciously introduced himself as Dennis. Looking at him again, he didn’t seem as frail as I’d thought earlier; he had the broad shoulders of someone who’d been professionally trained, though he wheezed somewhat when he inhaled. A naive flicker of hope pushed me to speak again. “Dennis, I need your help. There’s a pack of dogs- or not dogs but hellhounds, not far from here. They… they killed me and my friends, and they’re going to hurt others. You hunt monsters, right?”

The old man hadn’t seemed to be listening, but at that question he choked out a laugh. “No boy I don’t. I’ve seen a great deal of spirits but haven’t found a one that’ll stay long enough to even share hellos. I a’int able to stop no hellhounds.” He turned and gestured for me to follow him through a dingy yellow kitchen, then into what I at first thought was a coat closet but was actually a basement. Down the stairs were wooden shelves filled with gadgets that looked the same as the communicator: toys originally meant for children that he had somehow transformed into ghost hunting equipment.

“I think maybe you and I can come to an arrangement, kid.” Dennis said in between explanations of what each contraption did. “Since no spirit ever stayed long enough to test out my equipment, I don’t know if half of it works. You try them out for me and find a way to get around it, I’ll help ya with your dog problem. I’m a retired sheriff’s deputy for this county, and I reckon I get the entire police force here within an hour if I ask.”

I was dumbfounded by this change in attitude, though I realized I shouldn’t have been. He still wasn’t the rugged monster hunter I’d envisioned, but he didn’t seem the type to turn down a fight.

“You’re on, old man. How hard can it be to get around this garbage?”

Very hard.

So far I’ve been warded off by ancient glyphs made from crushed up dandelion flowers kept inside a tin can, trapped possessing a toaster for three days after I fed Dennis’ freshly caught fish dinner to his cat, and stopped from smashing any of his creations with a viscous mixture I’m fairly certain he concocted with mouthwash. He’s even made himself glasses so he could always see me with chicken wire and glass yogurt jars. I haven’t been taking any of it seriously until last week.

I was pouring vegetable oil on a tarp I’d found in Dennis’ barn to send him sliding into his old outhouse when the bottle fell through my hand. Annoyed, I tried to pick it back up, only for my hand to phase right through the bottle. Panic began worming its way through my brain. Despite being invisible as a spirit, I’d always been able to pick things up and move them around. I immediately thrust my hand towards the bottle again, then tried once more before frantically waving my hand around inside the container to no avail.

I wasn’t able to touch anything for three days.

Dennis wasn’t able to hear or see me either, though he only berated me for screwing with him once my voice hissed across his speaker. I was too scared to explain. I had felt untouchable since I’d died, the answer to life’s biggest mystery solved. But the longer and more frequently I disappeared, the more certain I became that something was reaching for me, determined to pull me into the unknown abyss for a second time.

That’s why I need your help.

If I don’t act soon, I won’t be able to get justice for my friends. So I need all of your best ideas on how to outwit Dennis. The more I can humiliate him in the process, the better.

Thanks in advance.

**(Dennis’ Note: I never knew the boy wasn’t just disappearing to make himself a nuisance. I wanna help‘im, but I don’t think he’d even want my pity if I gave in without a fight. I won’t be looking at the comments. I hope y’all are as sharp as he says, for his sake.)**
