I was apprehensive about meeting Dr. Harrison for this coffee date. The only thing that made me want to take it, was finally learning what the hell was happening. And a part of me was excited to be on a date with Dr. Harrison. Even after everything that I had seen at the clinic, including him ripping his own face off, a part of me was squealing like a teenager finally landing a date with her crush. And, even if I did quit afterward like I wanted to, I would at least finally know what was going on at the clinic. With Wilson, the patients, Dr. Harrison, everything. Maybe even the lost and found thief. 



Normally, I don’t take very long to get ready, but a part of me wanted to put more effort into this meeting. In my head, it was going to be the last time I ever saw Dr. Harrison. So I put on my nice pair of jeans and button-up, surprised that it still fit me since the last time I wore it was during my cousin’s wedding. A quick spritz of perfume and I was ready. And in my head, I felt stupid, it wasn’t like this was an actual date. But I figured I might as well take advantage of it. 



I was happy that I was allowed to choose the coffee shop and picked one close to the city and further away from the office. I wanted to be around as many people as possible and was happy to see that the shop was pretty busy. I took a seat at a table near the window to look out to see Dr. Harrison when he finally showed up, and so others could see us in case something happened during our ‘date’. I sat there and began to shake my legs anxiously as I waited for him to show up.



I didn’t have much longer to wait when I saw him approaching the coffee shop. It was so offputting to see him in clothes that weren’t his scrubs and lab coat. A turtleneck wasn’t something I ever knew he would wear, but seeing him wearing that was enough for me to immediately know that I had made the right choice in accepting this date. 



“Good morning, doctor,” I told him as I stood up from my chair when he entered the shop and walked over to me. He looked at me and gave me a soft smile, as he rubbed his hand through his brown hair. 



“You can just call me James, Maggie. We aren’t at work at the moment,” he said with a little chuckle. It was a force of habit. It’s like trying not to call your old teacher Mr. or Mrs. “Have you ordered yet? I know I have…a lot of explaining to do to you.” I shook my head and he led us over to the barista. He ordered a simple black coffee and I got a basic latte. You can judge me all you want, and you’d be right. I’m basic. 



We both sat down at the table and stared awkwardly at our coffees. It was obvious that he was trying to find the right words, so I just sat there taking small sips from my latte. Finally, he cleared his throat and looked at me with those beautiful green eyes. 



“About five years ago…I was attacked.” He sighed heavily, lifting the hot black coffee to his lips and taking a small sip. “I was attacked by a patient. She wasn’t satisfied with the work I gave her. I had told her that I could no longer operate on her because she was clearly addicted to cosmetic surgery. She didn’t take the news well.” He took another sip from his coffee cup. 



“What did she do?” I asked him, trying to imagine how her attacking him had led to…everything that happened at the clinic daily. “If I can ask that, of course.” I cushioned my invasive question, but Dr. Harrison didn’t seem to mind, giving me a small little smile. 



“She threw a cup of acid at my face. Sliced it up real good with a scalpel, and as a chaser lit it on fire. The only reason I’m still alive is because Rachel threw mop water on me to put out the fire. The acid was harder to wash off.” He explained, the smile still on his face, but his eyes betrayed just how traumatizing it had been for him. 



I looked at his beautiful face and didn’t see a single scar, or any blemish. Then of course I thought back to him ripping his face off back at the clinic. And it suddenly all hit me at once. His need for skin, him coming into work with his face covered up. 



“That isn’t your real face, is it?” I asked him, placing my drink on the table to stare at him. He looked at me in the eyes and I stared into those big jewels he had. A soft swirl began to appear in his eyes, and my head began to throb suddenly. 



“It isn’t…” He looked back down at his coffee and my headache disappeared the moment his eyes were taken off of mine. “But for an entire year, I was in recovery, and even though I got reconstructive surgery…that…fucking bitch…ruined my face!” He shouted, quickly looking around at the other patrons who snapped their attention over at us. “Sorry…” he said with a heavy sigh. 



“But…if this isn’t your real face, how did you get it?” I asked him, doing my best to avoid his eyes. As beautiful as they were, something about them suddenly began to rub me the wrong way. I gripped my cup close to me and kicked myself for not getting something hotter. If he tried something I could at least throw scolding hot coffee in his face as a defense mechanism. 



“It’s…a long story.” He looked down at his cup of coffee and pushed it further away from himself, staring down at the table for a long while, as he gathered up the courage to tell me. “After she attacked me, I…lost my mind. In more ways than one,” He gave a little giggle before he quickly stopped and cleared his throat. 



“I uh…started…I uh…” He let out a heavy sigh, the embarrassment and shame he was feeling was palpable to me. “I started killing people…to give myself the satisfaction of having a better looking face. Heh…it sounds stupid when I say it…but I earnestly thought that it was helping me.” He continued to stare down at the table, while I stared at him in shock, he had broken the Hippocratic oath and the fucking law as well. 



“James…that doesn’t answer my question,” I told him, thinking he was deflecting.



“Oh I’m getting to that…see after I had killed my parents…” I couldn’t help but let out a gasp and quickly covered my mouth. “My mother…she uh…insulted my face. So I hacked her to pieces. And my dad was so in love and attached to her, that I couldn’t let him live in a world without her.” He explained with a nonchalant shrug. “But soon afterwards…I met my savior.” He explained with whimsy in his voice. 



It suddenly clicked in my head. “The man on the phone?” I asked him. He finally looked up from the table and nodded enthusiastically, his green eyes shining so brightly I thought he’d blind me. 



“Mr. Sinclair found me…and put me in touch with someone who gave me powers to…sculpt my beautiful face back.” He reached his hand to his face and let out a happy hum. He was like a giddy schoolgirl talking about her high school crush. Or like how I talked about him. “And…I’m sure you’ve noticed my beautiful eyes. It’s hard not to, I’m sure.” He giggled a little. 



His demeanor was completely different than normal. The smooth, almost aloof handsome surgeon had transformed into a deranged madman before my eyes. The ease with which he told me he killed his parents and other people terrified and all the while his eyes began to drill into my very soul. 



“You’re very special, Maggie. You have a healthy self-image, that’s what drew me to you. My eyes, they can control people with low self-esteem and people who are easily manipulated. Hypnotize them almost. But you…I can’t control you. I can suggest some things to you…but I can’t control you,” he told me, his eyes gleamed brightly and I snuck a peak at them. I stared deep into them and, to my surprise, saw spirals in them. 



“I was gifted with these eyes, and with the powers to…meld skin.” He smiled widely and suddenly he reached across the table and grabbed my hands. I flinched backward but he held onto my hands tightly. “I use other people’s skin to replace my own. And I can meld the human body into any shape that I want.” People were starting to look at us now and some were even murmuring. I prayed that one of them would come over here and get me out of this situation. 



“D-Dr? Y-you’re hurting my hands,” I squeaked in pain as he squeezed them. That seemed to snap him out of whatever state he was in. His eyes dimmed and he looked down at his own hands and he quickly let go of them. 

  


“I-I’m sorry, Maggie.” He told me, instantly retreating into his seat and frantically pushing his hair back into place. “I uh…got carried away.” He reached out and grabbed his cup of coffee and took a long sip from the cup. I rubbed my own hands and looked down at them. 



“So…it isn’t permanent, is it? You need to keep doing it? Taking…people’s skin?” I asked him, trying to get him back on track, and hoping that he would maintain his normal composure. He looked back up at me like a confused puppy. 



“Oh…yes. Unfortunately, it isn’t permanent. Every few weeks I need to replace it. Nothing I’ve tried has been able to make it last longer. Not only that, but I can’t control this power very well either. As you saw with Wilson and the last patient, if I don’t concentrate hard enough, things go very wrong.” He took another long sip from his coffee. 



That answered a lot of questions. Why Wilson was a goop monster and how the human body suddenly turned into a scorpion creature. An awkward silence again came over our table as I tried to process everything. My boss was a murderer, an evil plastic surgeon who had somehow managed to go underneath the radar. And yet, after this bombardment of information I had a random thought that I wanted to know.



“What keeps stealing from the lost and found?” I asked him as I started sipping my watered-down latte. He looked at me with confusion on his face, and then suddenly it clicked in his head and he couldn’t help but start laughing, 



“That thing, you don’t have to worry about it. It's mostly harmless,” he said and started laughing about it. I looked at him and couldn’t help but worry about the fact he called whatever it was ‘It’. That didn’t do much to instill confidence. But I also thought about another important question. 



“Why does Rachel hate me so much?” I asked him. He looked at me after finishing up his giggle fit. He nodded and reached into his pocket, pulling his phone out, and pulled a picture up. He flipped it over and showed me. I took it from him and stared at it for a good long time. It was Dr. Harrison with another chubby woman. It took me a few seconds to realize that, it was Rachel. 



“I think she’s projecting. I helped her lose all that weight and excess skin, but she also is projecting onto you. Unlike her, you’re comfortable with who you are. She still isn’t. She’s more plastic than skin at this point.” He sighed as he reached over to take his phone back. My mind was barely functioning now. 



“Sir…I don’t think I can work with you anymore.” I told him after I took a few more minutes to collect all my thoughts. I just couldn’t bring myself to continue working at the clinic. Fuck all the money, I no longer felt safe there knowing what kind of person Dr. Harrison was. 



“What?” He asked in shock. “No. No, I can’t allow that, Maggie.” His voice was drenched in desperation. His eyes lit up again and my head began to throb like a hammer was being smashed into it. He was trying to get into my head again. “Maggie I can’t allow you to leave! I refuse!” He reached out and grabbed my hands again. I panicked and quickly reached out to the nearest object I could find. Yanking one of my hands out and grabbing a napkin dispenser, I smashed it against his face. 



“You bitch!” He screamed, standing up and staggering around. He looked at me with rage in those beautiful eyes. Where I had smashed his face, the skin was now dangling from his cheek, revealing heavily scarred skin underneath it. People were murmuring and talking, Dr. Harrison flashed his eyes at all of them and growled like a cornered animal. “What are you all looking at?! Piss off!” He screamed at them, and everyone went on their way like nothing even happened. 



I quickly stood up from the table and backed away from Dr. Harrison while he stared at me with anger in his eyes. “I-I’m sorry sir! I just don’t feel safe anymore!” I told him, backing up and searching through my purse, pulling out my pepper spray and holding it in front of me like a shield. 



“I can’t allow you to quit, I’d rather kill you than let you leave.” He told me, grabbing the flap of loose skin and ripping it off with a sickening tear. More of his true face was revealed, more heavily scarred and misshapen skin. It was almost like looking at a real life ‘The Picture of Dorian Grey.’ Half of his face was stunning but the other half was scarred and heavily damaged. 



After a small standoff with each other, Dr. Harrison lunged at me and I deployed the pepper spray at him. I covered his face in it but he still tackled me to the floor and began to strangle me. I choked and gagged as he applied pressure to my windpipe. I tried to pry his hands off of my throat but his hands were like iron and I couldn’t get them off. The pepper spray seemed to not affect him so in desperation I reached up and began to claw at his face with my nails. He screamed out and quickly let go of my throat to touch his face. And while he did I quickly shoved him off of me. 



Standing up and sucking in air, I quickly ran out of the coffee shop, with Dr. Harrison screaming after me. I managed to reach my car and quickly started it up, peeling out of the parking lot and almost hitting some pedestrians on my way out. In panic, I called the only person I could think of to help me. 



“Why are you calling me fatass?” Rachel asked me as I started driving towards the clinic. “I thought you were on a date with Dr. Harrison.” She sounded extremely jealous, and if he hadn’t just tried to kill me I would’ve understood where she was coming from. 



“Listen you bitch, I know you used to be fat too. Now shut the fuck up and help me. Dr. Harrison just tried to kill me, and I damaged his face and he’s probably gonna kill me, and I need your help.” I begged her, gripping the steering wheel tightly. There was a good long pause. 



“Meet me at the clinic. Mr. Sinclair should be here soon and he’ll be able to calm him down.” She sighed, before hanging up on me. I let out a soft sigh and sped up slightly to get to the clinic. I arrived soon afterward and quickly ran to the clinic door after parking. I was thankful to have a key and I quickly slipped in. 



“Hi, Maggie! I thought you didn’t work today.” Wilson was surprised to see me, but he was also happy to see me. I quickly waved at him and ran past him, quickly sitting down in my seat and letting out a long sigh. Just as I sat down, something hit me in the head. It was small and before I could register what it was, another thing hit me in the head. Looking around I saw that two bottlecaps had hit me in the head. I looked over to the lost and found box and noticed that several items were moving around. 



I carefully and sneakily rolled my chair over to the box and peeked inside. I saw an item that I knew for a fact had never been in there before. A burnt piece of bread. And to my confusion and shock, it was moving around in the box looking for something. It was walking around on black noodle like appendages and was ‘speaking’ in squeaks and hisses. 



“Uh…hi?” I tried talking to it. It stopped dead in its tracks and turned to look at me. It had several human eyes stuck to its crust and all of them stared in various directions. Once they all landed on me, the bread creature let out a loud screech. Just as quickly, it grabbed some random keys from the box and ran out of the box at speeds that would make the road runner jealous. I couldn’t even process what had just happened. A burnt piece of toast with human eyes and noodle appendages had been stealing from the lost and found box. 



As I sat there trying to process what I had just seen, Rachel finally entered the clinic and walked over to the desk to meet me. Her usual bitch demeanor was different, she seemed like a normal person for the first time. 



“Good, you’re not dead.” She sighed, looking back over at Wilson and motioning for him to come over. “Mr. Sinclair should be here soon and he can usually talk sense into Dr. Harrison, so we just need to hold him off until then.” She looked over at Wilson who finally made his way over to us. 



“Wilson, make sure not to let Dr. Harrison through, okay? Otherwise, I’m turning the heater on.” She ordered him. Our security guard gave us a salute and quickly made his way back to his position, locking the door and standing near the door like a dog who knew someone was about to enter. 



“So…he told you, huh?” Rachel asked me as she tied her hair up in a ponytail. I looked over at her and nodded a bit. I tried to imagine her as the lady in the picture. There was no indication that she had ever been anything but a thin bitch. 



“You hate me 'cause I’m fat? Or are you just projecting on me?” I asked her, keeping a side eye on the lost and found box, not sure if the bread thing was hostile or not. “Or maybe a little bit of both?” I asked her with a little giggle. 



She sighed and leaned on the desk to get a good look at me. “It’s probably both. I had so many insecurities, and here you are just as happy as could be. It pisses me off. Even after I got the surgery, I still don’t like myself. Maybe that has part to do with what I help Dr. Harrison do.” She sighed, rubbing her face and groaning softly. 



“What does he do exactly? Obviously, I know he skins people, but how do people keep coming back here?” I asked her. 



“He replaces it with silicone. Even me, I’m more plastic than a Barbie at this point.” She looked over at the door quickly when someone started trying to get inside the clinic. When angry knocks started pounding at the door we both figured that it was Dr. Harrison. 



“Is that plastic skin, stabproof?” I asked, quickly looking around for some kind of weapon to use to defend myself. 



“No, unfortunately.” She told me as she took her purse off and placed it down on my reception desk. She fished through it and pulled out a taser. I looked at her with a raised brow and she shrugged at me. “When you’re this pretty you need something tougher than pepper spray.” 



“Pepper spray didn’t work on him,” I told her, rolling over to the lost and found box and searching for something to defend myself with. I picked up a small pocket knife and quickly blew the bread crumbs off of it. It was going to have to do. 



“Let me in, god damn it!” Dr. Harrison screamed from the other side of the door. I looked over at Rachel, wondering what her plan was. I didn’t get a chance to wonder because Wilson simply opened the door for him. 



“Wilson! What the fuck?” Rachel shouted, but one look at him told us that he had unfortunately locked eyes with Dr. Harrison. He meekly stepped aside after opening the door and Dr. Harrison rushed into the room. His beautiful face was gone, replaced with the heavily scarred and damaged face he had described. His right ear was gone, his hair was in clumps growing from his head and he had no eyelids to speak of. That woman had done horrible damage to his face, and I could almost feel sorry for him if he wasn’t about to try and kill me. 



“Sir, I need you to calm down, please,” Rachel told him, pointing her taser at him. He stared at her like a rabid animal and looked down at the weapon pointed at him. He walked over to her and she slowly began to lower the taser. I looked over and let out a whimper when I saw that his eyes her shining again. I hoped that Rachel might be able to resist as I could, but she wordlessly got out of his way as he continued his approach over to me. 



“Maggie…I can’t let you quit. I won’t let you.” He told me, his eyes burning with anger and the swirls on full display as he tried to get to me. My head throbbed and I quickly swung around in my chair and ran out into the hallway toward one of the operating rooms. He screamed after me, and I slammed the door, quickly locking it and even pushing a chair up against the door. I was trapped and I had no way out. 



I started to look around for anything that might help me. But all the cabinets and tools were locked behind keys that only Rachel or Dr. Harrison had. In my search, I suddenly noticed a black spot on the wall. It almost looked like mold, but as I walked over to examine it, it grew rapidly in size. And before my eyes, I watched as a tale, pale, and blond man stepped out from the now giant stain on the wall. 



He was the most well groomed man I had ever seen, and with giant bags under his eyes, he also looked like the most tired man in the world. He looked around the room and then over at me. He stared at me like he found a cockroach in his soup. 



“You’re the receptionist who called me?” He asked me as the stain disappeared behind him and slithered into the shape of his shadow. I nodded at him and figured that this was Mr. Sinclair. Just as I had been introduced, Dr. Harrison began banging on the door. 



“Maggie! Open this fucking door!” He screamed, slamming his fists against the door. Mr. Sinclair sighed as he rubbed his tired eyes. I stared at him and then down at his shadow. I was shocked to see two bright white eyes staring back at me from his shadow, and a giant white grin came across the shadow’s face. 



Sinclair walked up to the door, moved the chair out of the way, and opened the door. Dr. Harrison slashed down with a scalpel, but Sinclair caught him by the arm and stared down angrily at him. Dr. Harrison quickly snapped out of his rage and stared up in shock at Sinclair. 



“S-sir! I-I…” He tried to say something but no words escaped from his lips as he stared at Sinclair. 



“We talked about this, James. How big of a mess are you in, now?” He demanded to know. Dr. Harrison looked at him again and sheepishly looked back down at the floor like a scolded child. “Let’s go to your office. We have a lot to discuss.” Sinclair walked past him after releasing his arm. Dr. Harrison looked over at me before dropping the scalpel and following after Sinclair like a puppy. 



Rachel walked in a few minutes later, rubbing her head softly and looking ashamed at having failed to help me. But I walked over to her and hugged her tightly. Just happy that I was still alive and not sliced into pieces completely. Dr. Harrison and Mr. Sinclair stayed in the former’s office for over an hour, before Harrison walked out of the office and walked over to one of the operating rooms. 



Mr. Sinclair walked out of the office, puffing on a cigar and staring at me. He beckoned for me to come over to him. I walked over and instantly felt the pressure mounting on me as I walked over to him. 



“I understand you don’t want to work here. But James has…issues with people leaving him. And if you do leave, I cannot guarantee your safety.” He explained to me. As he talked, a skeletal-like figure appeared behind him and smiled at me, gurgling and dripping black sludge on the floor around him. 



“B-but I don’t feel safe here.” I tried to explain to him, but he held his hand up to silence me, and the creature gurgled again. Almost like it was laughing at me. 



“I understand that. But I can offer you more money to keep working here and to keep him happy and most importantly out of trouble.” He reached into his suit jacket pocket and pulled out his checkbook. I was going to turn him down instantly. And then he showed me how much money was being offered. 



I also specified that I wanted to ensure my safety while working here. He agreed and made sure to talk to Dr. Harrison about it. And, I accepted that money, on top of my paycheck as well. And I’m still working here to this day. 



Dr. Harrison continues to fix his skin with other people’s. But since I decided to keep working here, he hasn’t flipped out on me once. And now knowing his secret, he does seem to be even friendlier to me. And even Rachel has been nicer to me, but she does still have her bitchy moments, but I’m more than capable of handling her. 



I don’t feel good about working here. And now that I know what goes on here, I feel disgusting watching people get their skin taken away for Dr. Harrison to continue looking absolutely gorgeous. But the silver lining is the amount of money I’m earning. I can turn a blind eye to most of this. But some days I do think about quitting. 



And then I feel those green glowing eyes staring at me. And I’m reminded that I’m stuck here.
