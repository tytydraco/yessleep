I’m still traumatized from 48 years ago, something happened, and it was so horrific… I wrote this document back in 2004, but now I have released it to the public and made it into a book form. Anyways, here it begins.  

CHAPTER 1. Saunaklonkku incident 1977. Victim: Kari-Pekka.

 It was the year 1977 in Kajaani, and I was getting ready for a sauna night, I had bought lots of beer. It was still very cold and a little bit foggy outside because it was winter. I was driving back home when I saw bunch of police officers investigating a crime scene in my neighborhood. It was a bit weird because my neighborhood was usually very quiet and peaceful.

My friend was also with me coming to the Sauna with me.

We drove to the cottage and got out of the car. It was dead silent outside.  After a few hours we were ready to go to the sauna. We went inside the sauna, sat down, and talked about some random things. After some time, my friend left to get some more beer from the car.       At the time he was out, I went to the terrace to drink beer. I had the radio on, and the news radio channel said that there might be a serial killer in the zone of Kajaani, Finland.                                    I was scared to hear it, so I thought that it was safer in the sauna than outside, so I went back in the sauna.
After some time, I heard noises under the Sauna benches, and it was weird.                                      I went to look under the benches and then suddenly I was being pulled under them.
Then just at that time my friend came back with a loaded shotgun. He said something about , that he was being followed, but then he noticed that I was being pulled under the benches, and he tried to shoot at the thing under them, but he missed and almost hit my knee. 
Then we heard police sirens outside my house. The thing under the benches managed to escape through a hole in the floor that I forgot to fix. Then probably about five police officers came into my house aiming their guns and said that they detected some weird creature in my yard.

They then asked, that did I see where the thing went, but I couldn’t tell where it did go The “thing” probably was the serial killer.

Then a few days later everyone started to call the serial killer “Saunaklonkku.”, because he was linked to the sauna “accidents”.

I thought that it would be a good idea to move away from my cottage to somewhere else like in a city, so I decided to sell my cottage and surprisingly someone bought it.

CHAPTER 2. Saunaklonkku returns 1981. Victim 2: Ukko Jokela.

In the year 1981 summer holiday started and my family of two kids, my wife and me bought the cottage. A few days later we decided to test out the sauna. My wife found an old shotgun shell from there and threw it away. After some time, my family and I went fishing at the nearby pond.
After an hour or two we went inside because the sun was setting.

The kids went to sleep, and I went to drink some beer and watch TV. Then after some time I heard screaming from upstairs.

(Ukko Jokela’s wife’s perspective.)
I heard one of my kids screaming in the upstairs bedroom, so I went to check on him. He was scared and asked that can I check under his bed if there were any monsters. I checked and sadly was someone, it was the Saunaklonkku. He jumped out from there and stood up holding a pocketknife.

(Ukko Jokela’s perspective.)

I came in the room and saw that Saunaklonkku stabbed my wife, then one of my kids jumped outside from the nearby window and landed in a spikey bush. Then I quickly ran downstairs with my other child. 
We escaped outside.

I got my child to safety, and then I prepared to strike back at Saunaklonkku. I went outside but then suddenly I was attacked by Saunaklonkku and he punched me, and I fell onto the ground, then Saunaklonkku started punching my face. I felt like I was going to die but then I noticed that Saunaklonkku had a gun with him. I managed to pull the gun out and shoot his kidney which should have been fatal but not for Saunaklonkku.

I pushed Saunaklonkku back to the basement and got gasoline i poured it down to the basement and then I shot the gasoline which made it burn, and it made Saunaklonkku burn too. I then ran away from the burning cottage and then in the end it exploded. 
I got in my car and drove away back towards Tampere.


CHAPTER 3. Urban explorers (2002) Victims: Tuure, Juho, Joni and Samuel.

In July me and three friends went exploring an abandoned cottage that exploded and went up in flames in the year 1981, and the stories told, that there was some kind of serial killer named “Saunaklonkku”. My friend’s names were Tuure, Juho and Joni. It was late at night, and we all had flashlights, except my flashlight was TERRIBLE, and I mean TERRIBLE. It barely even worked, and it had cracks on it. Everything was going okay, until we came across animal skeletons, and it smelled so bad. Suddenly, we heard footsteps behind us, and we turned but there was no one. We decided to not trust the stories and split up and be in groups of two. 

(Juho’s perspective.)

I teamed up with Joni and went upstairs. There was a broken railing, so it was easy to fall downstairs, there was also a deep hole way deeper than the first floor, it was like 9 meters deep. Suddenly I felt a tap on my shoulder and when I turned, there was the Saunaklonkku. I tried to punch toward it, but nothing worked. He pushed me from the broken railing, and it caused me to fall into the darkness.

(Joni’s perspective.)

I saw Juho get pushed to an old rusty chainsaw that cut him in half and I ran as fast as I could to the kitchen, but it was a dead end and then Saunaklonkku was chasing me. I kept trying to scream for Tuure and Samuel, but they were not answering. I came across a dead end, and Saunaklonkku was right in front of me. I took off my hoodie and got in a fighting position. I swung a punch at it, but it grabbed my arm and started twisting it. I started hearing my bones cracking and dislocating, I started seeing blood splatter from my wrist and elbow. A bone pierced through my arm, and before I even had time to react, my arm got ripped off and blood splattered everywhere. I screamed in pain, and I kicked its stomach. Unfortunately, it grabbed my leg too and threw me on the ground on my neck. I gave up and accepted my end. Saunaklonkku took a rusty pocketknife and stabbed me in both eyes, blood splattering everywhere. I felt my throat getting sliced open, and after that, I only heard footsteps fading away towards the broken basement door.

 
(Samuel’s perspective.)

I witnessed both deaths with the binoculars I got for my birthday. I did not have time to look for Tuure, so I ran towards the door to escape. I took my phone out of my pocket, and it had only 1% left on battery, so i quickly dialed the emergency number, and I screamed for help. I didn’t tell them why. I just screamed help. After that, the phone went black. The battery had run out. I ran outside and I realized, that Saunaklonkku was chasing me the whole time. Saunaklonkku almost got me, but the police got there just in time and started to shoot at it and somehow my phone turned off and i quickly got a photo of Saunaklonkku.  Saunaklonkku ran back inside, and I got treated by the police officers.

(Tuure’s perspective.)

I was in the basement, looking at old stuff with my flashlight. I heard the old basement door creaking open, and I said “Hey, look what I found!” but there was no answer. I pointed my flashlight at the door, and I saw Saunaklonkku. I started to think and chose a peaceful approach saying that i can leave without causing any harm, but he just laughed in a creepy laugh and knew my friends were...dead. The talking could not work so i threw my flashlight at Saunaklonkku’s head, but it did nothing. It ran towards me, grabbed me, and threw me at a brick wall. I heard some of my ribs breaking when I hit the wall, and blood started flowing from my mouth. Saunaklonkku ran towards me and tried to rip my back open, but I got free. I tried to run to the basement door, but I slipped on a mud puddle and something sharp cut my hand open, I also hit my head on an old frying pan. Blood was gushing out of my hand and head, but when I tried to get back up, Saunaklonkku threw a cooking knife at my leg, trapping me to the ground. It ripped off both of my hands off, blood getting everywhere and bones cracking. A bone piece flew straight at my head, ripping a piece off my forehead. Then it ripped off my toenails slowly and painfully. Then Saunaklonkku slammed an axe on my legs, creating a very deep wound all the way from my skin to my bone. Then it got the axe again and slammed in on my chest and pulled in all the way to my waist. It opened my stomach and ripped all my organs out, including my spine. Then Saunaklonkku ripped all my hair out, ripped my eyes out and skinned me alive. After that, it ripped my head off with bare hands. My skin was only muscle and veins.


After that, Saunaklonkku was never seen again… for now…
