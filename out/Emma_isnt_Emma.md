Me and my girlfriend went on a getaway, although it wasn’t her in that cabin with me. 


So, my story begins with me and my girlfriend planning a little getaway, we had been thinking about it for a while and decided it was finally time. With both of our jobs becoming stressful and general life struggles, we took some of our savings and put it into a long weekend stay in the Lake district. Friday to Monday.

The day before we were planning to leave, I noticed my girlfriend wasn’t feeling the best, she said it was nothing physical just a feeling she had, the way she described it. I can only see as nervousness or even dread. I offered to postpone or even cancel all together but she insisted we go anyway, so off we went.

On arrival to the small cabin, about 5pm. I immediately noticed a change in Emma; she had spoken less and less the closer we got but was whispering things under her breath. She had not even made any comments about the place as we entered and looked around, the closest neighbour was at least a mile away, on the other side of the lake just outside our cabin. Which I did purposefully for her, she deals with a lot of stupid people in her job and thought being fully away from them would be ideal. But still no comments.

As the evening went on, we made some dinner, I tried my best to spark up some conversation but still not a lot from Emma. I put that up to her not feeling great and the long day we had. I plated up our food and took it into the living room. 
So, we could eat by the fire, as I set the plates down, I noticed I didn’t hear her behind me anymore, she was walking right behind me a second ago, carrying our drinks. I turned to the hallway leading to the kitchen but was just met with darkness, where could she have gone? 

“Babe?” I called out, hoping id get a little response of ‘just forgot my phone in the kitchen’ or something that would have made her change direction suddenly without mentioning it. But nothing, just eerie silence with the occasional crackling of the fire. It wasn’t a big deal so I just sat down and began browsing for something for us to watch while we ate.  

It must have been 5 minutes since I called for her, and still not a single sound in the whole house. I called her name again but still nothing, I listened intently, for a door to close, a toilet to flush. Anything. Until I heard a slow and deliberate creaking of a floor board. Just behind the sofa where I was sat, there was no way she could’ve gotten to that spot. She would have to come from that corridor on my right leading from the kitchen, she would have to walk right by me to get to the hallway to the bedroom which was directly behind me. 

I switched the TV off out of impulse to try and hear better. And then I froze, in the TV reflection, I saw my girlfriend, her hair dripping wet, clothes torn and drenched and she was smiling, less than a foot behind my back. I jumped up and turned around, but no one was there, not my girlfriend, not a puddle on the floor like I expected, but more creaking. Like she was stood right there but I just couldn’t see her. I stared intently down the hallway to the bedroom, not taking my eyes off of it, hopeful I would hear another creak to locate who or whatever that was I just saw.

“Hey babe, are you okay?” A voice came from my left, I screamed and jolted backwards, almost knocking the food off the table. 

“Woah what’s up, you look like you’ve seen a ghost” my girlfriend said to me with a small laugh.
“Where the fuck did you come from?”

“I had to pee? Is that okay with you?” she said sarcastically.

I tried to slow my breathing as I sat down next to my now concerned girlfriend.
“What happened?”

“I thought I saw …. Someone in the reflection”

“Are you sure? Maybe it was just the coatrack next to the door, how many wines have you had again?”

I was reluctant to just dismiss it like that, but I agreed. Maybe my brain was making me see things just because I felt a bit creeped out. I just wanted this weird moment to be over. We sat and watched TV but I couldn’t help but feel like I was being watched and every so often I heard the faintest dripping sound. The sound of water hitting wooden floor boards right behind me.

We were getting ready for bed that night, and to be honest, I was still a little freaked out. I wanted to talk about it but I didn’t really know how to say ‘hey babe why was you being a creepy shit in the TV reflection and then teleported’ so I didn’t mention it again, I’ve always very much believed in ghosts and the paranormal, but Emma not so much, so I didn’t want to be dismissed or even laughed at, because it did sound insane.

The night was fairly uneventful, a couple of sounds in the dark house that could’ve been explained away, so nothing to worry about. Maybe I truly didn’t see what I thought I did earlier that evening and this cabin wasn’t haunted to shit. With that I closed my eyes and slept, I dreamt vividly about the lake, me and girlfriend having a picnic right next to it, the sun was shining, birds chirping. A seemingly beautiful scene, we both stood up and ran up to the water’s edge, I looked down, amused at the ripples in the water making us both look strange. 

Then, the water calmed and I focused on my girlfriend’s reflection. In it she was smiling, unnervingly wide, and her head rotated to stare at me, though her body remained forward. I pulled my gaze to her face quickly and she was just peacefully looking out across the horizon, the complete opposite to what I had just seen. I woke up immediately and looked over at my girlfriend to find her sleeping, the same rhythm of snores as usual. I let out a deep breath and tried to go back to sleep, hoping for less fucked up dreams this time please.

The next day, it was as if nothing even happened. Me and Emma had a day or walking, laughing and just enjoying our time. There was a couple of times I would find her just staring off, whispering under her breath but when I spoke to her or when she felt me watching her, she was her usual self, in the evening however, I don’t know where my girlfriend went and what was in her place.

We cooked, ate dinner, watched some TV, showered and got into bed. Nothing out of the ordinary, until it came time to sleep, Emma was already rolled over on her side and her breathing starting to become her soft snores. But I couldn’t help but feel uneasy, just a gut feeling telling me I shouldn’t sleep, that it wasn’t safe. I don’t know what made me do this but I decided to go to the living room for an hour or so and read, in the dark, by myself. I don’t claim to be the smartest but even I know this was a bit weird of me to do. 

But before I even know it, I was downstairs, drink in hand and starting to open my book. I sat in the big brown armchair, which was backed on the same wall as the TV in the living room, which meant it was facing the bedroom corridor, with the hallway to the kitchen on my left. However, when I was reading the book was covering most of my vision. I must’ve been reading for about 15 minutes when I first heard it, a sharp and quick “Hey” in my left ear. 

Immediately I slammed my book down scanning the area, the room wasn’t exactly well lit but it was illuminated by a small lamp next to me. The warm light didn’t reach to the end of the hallways but that didn’t matter, because the voice must’ve been centimetres from my ear. I was a bit cautious but ultimately, I ignored it, I was tired. I assumed it was a similar situation to when you have headphones on, and all of a sudden someone is calling your name, that must’ve been it. I was simply so engrossed in my book, I thought I heard something.

I got back to reading and the same again, maybe 15 minutes later another sharp and quick “Hey” to my right ear this time, again I react quick and look around, I think I see something just out of view going down the corridor. I whisper my girlfriends name just in case it was her but had no response. I listened for a second more and decided to just go to bed, as I was putting my book away and moving the blanket off me, I heard another slightly louder and angrier “Hey!” this time there was no mistaking if I had just been too into the book and imagined it. 

That was a real voice in my ear, I even felt the breath against my skin, it was cold and smelt rotted. I turned that way expecting to see someone, an intruder maybe, or even my girlfriend playing a weird joke which is incredibly unlike her. But I once again was met with nothing, and empty dimly lit space.
I picked up my pace to the bedroom, it wasn’t much safer in there but at least I wasn’t alone. I almost made it to the bedroom when I dared to look back, I wish I hadn’t. 

As I turned, I saw something shuffle behind a curtain to try to make itself out of sight. I didn’t miss the long auburn hair that snaked behind the curtain with them. I almost laughed; it was Emma. Of course it was, she was trying to scare me, probably trying to get me back with that one time I jumped out on her. I went to open the bedroom door so I could fake shut it and sneak up on her behind the curtain, but before I even had the chance, I saw something in the corner of my eye. 

It was my girlfriend, sleeping in the same position and rhythm she had been. My world stopped, what on earth was behind the curtain. I went into the bedroom and shut the door behind me, locking it while I tried to come up with a plan. This woke up Emma and once I explained what I had seen, she motioned to a baseball bat by the door and we checked. Of course, we found nothing and once again I was convinced I watch too many horror films. 

Emma was tired and didn’t believe I had seen anything, so we got into bed.  And I managed to eventually fall asleep, with one arm out of the bed, clutching the baseball bat.

The night sleep was rough, it was plagued with vivid dreams and nightmares, all flashing across my brain, all being too nonsensical to have any meaning, apart from on. We are in bed, in my dream I had just woken up and Emma isn’t beside me; I pull on my slippers and I go searching for her, I hear scratching along the wall and I follow the noise, I go and find Emma or what is trying to be her, crouched, in the corner cracking coming from her body and she twists and turns. I put my hand on her shoulder and she turns immediately plunging a knife into my side, her smile doesn’t waver and it seems to grow I look up at her as I fall to the floor clutching my side, I see her whisper ‘don’t get out of bed’ Then I woke up, and it was morning.  

The next morning, I felt groggy, unrested and frankly a little annoyed. I would never dismiss Emma’s fears and yet that’s what she did to me, so through breakfast I didn’t speak, with nothing to say as all my thoughts were filled with what I have seen. I can tell this upset Emma and I felt guilty, but this was just how it had to be for a while. A few hours later Emma told me, she had a surprise, I followed her out the cabin to a picnic set just on the edge of the lake, It made me smile. 

There’s my Emma, smiling sweetly with the sun on her cheeks. We sat down and ate, we chatted and it seemed a weight was lifted off my shoulders, I don’t know what had been causing these dreams and maybe hallucinations but I would make an appointment for when we got back. We sat there for a while and then what seemed to be many flies, coming close to Emma’s head, circling her, she tried to ignore it and wave them away but ran off with a small giggle .

It was a little odd with how many there were but I laughed and ran after her until we both ended standing right along the water line, she brushed the leaves off her and they fell into the water, creating a ripple. I glanced down and was amused by how the rippling made us look strange. And then it hit me, my dream. This is exactly how it went; my memory was hazy with what happened next. It felt like weird déjà vu but lased with dread. As the water calmed, I looked up at my girlfriend, admiring how beautiful she was while looking out and gazing at the scenery. I smiled to myself at how lucky I am and glanced down. 

The smile on my face was immediately ripped off when I saw the horror in the reflection. Emma had that twisted gaping smile with her head cranked toward me. I let out a sound of terror and walked backward until that thing was no longer in view. I spun on my heel and sprinted back into the house, desperate to be away from Emma and whatever was pretending to be her. Not knowing which was real.

Of course, my girlfriend came after me and tried to calm me down, I could barely get my words out before I saw her eyeroll. I was starting to have enough of it. I stated firmly I want to leave immediately but was met with reasons why this is important to her and we need this break. I tried to speak my case but was told it wasn’t real, and maybe just a coincidence. 

I was starting to believe her when I looked down and noticed my girlfriend’s nails were going black and looked dead, her hair dry and breaking off, the opposite of how she usually cares for it. She looked different but the same, like a twin but who had been in the dark her whole life. I knew we needed to get out of here and fast, but I couldn’t convince her. I was worried whatever had taken up residence in my wife would act out, hurt her. So, I compromised on the next morning, just had to get through one more night.

I went to bed scared, scared for my wife and very scared of her, I know she was still in there so I tried to be patient and get us out of here as soon as I could without triggering anything. Slowly through exhaustion, I fell asleep.
I woke up suddenly, as if someone has thrown water over me. To find Emma not next to me, maybe she was thirsty or went to get something to eat, she hasn’t eaten much since we’ve been here. I stood up to go and find her to make sure she was okay, as I bent down to put on my slippers I thought about earlier that day, how uncanny it had been, there was no way it was a coincidence. 

I had the exact dream and then it came true. I’m not sure what that meant but it freaked me out, a thought flashed through my mind, of a dream I had the night before.
I froze, it came flooding back to me, me waking up and finding Emma gone, searching for her, the scratching, her crouching and then the knife. The memory hit me like a brick and I almost went dizzy, I reluctantly stood up, went to the door and twisted the handle. 

Theres no way this is happening, my dreams aren’t coming true, are they? That’s impossible, but it did happen, only once maybe not this time. But I had to make sure my Emma was okay. I took a couple steps down the hallway, my breathing shallow and rapid, repeating to myself it can’t be real. I turned the corner and heard a faint noise; I strained to hear it but it got louder and louder and then it was unmistakable. 

It was scratching.
