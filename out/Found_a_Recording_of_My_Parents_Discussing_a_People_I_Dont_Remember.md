My parents recently passed away, and after a period of mourning, I inherited the arduous task of cleaning the house where I grew up. They lived in the stone-built house in the countryside, facing a lake. I loved playing and running around there, spending more time by the lake or in the adjacent woods than inside the house. I didn't want to keep many things, as they would remind me too much of my parents, so I decided to sort them out for donation.I started with the attic, making several trips to drop off hundreds of knick-knacks. Among dusty boxes and old photographs, I found an audio tape tucked away, its title unknown, but the year 1995 marked on it. I must have been around 5 or 6 years old at the time. It seemed like a good idea to listen to it, a tribute to my parents, one last time, hearing their laughter, maybe even my childish voice.

Fortunately, there was a tape player among the other things. I positioned it in the designated space while preparing some coffee. Outside, the fog rising from the lake was already beginning to envelop the scenery, as the last rays of sun attempted to pierce through. I climbed the stairs to my old room to listen to the recording. Everything was just as I had left it: the small tube TV, airplane mobiles, a Buzz Lightyear poster, and my sticker collection in a shoebox under the bed. I sat down, pressed the red button, and the whir of the tape sounded like a rhythmic noise.

Contrary to my expectations, what came out was a more solemn, serious tone. My parents were in conversation with a third man, presumably a detective or a policeman, whom I'll refer to as D.

*D: Well, Mr. M, Mrs. J, can you tell me what happened last Friday, the 15th?*

*J: We've already told everything we know, sir.*

*D: I apologize, Mrs. J, but it's standard procedure; we need this for the report.*

*M: Well, we are M\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and J\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Carlson, living in this house by the lake \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_... with our son.*

*D: Okay, and what happened on the 15th?*

M: As usual, we had breakfast together. I'm already off work on Fridays, and J takes care of the house, so we took advantage of it for a family moment. After breakfast, the four of us went for a walk.

A thunderclap echoed outside, startling me. The storm was now roaring louder, raindrops pinging sharply against the window. Soon, the expanding lake would lead to flooding. Four? I thought. Who was the fourth family member? Was it a visit from a relative, or perhaps a friend who came to stay?

*D: Alright, it was close to... - He cleared his throat - the incident?*

*M: Yes, about three or maybe four hours before, I suppose.*

*D: Understandable. Where did you go?*

*M: Fishing by the lake. It's towards the end of summer that they're usually more active... the fish, I mean. We stayed there for an hour until Peter wanted to use the bathroom.*

Peter, me. While my father spoke, I had a vague memory of that day. A haze seemed to cover my recollections, and the shape of this "fourth person" was not at all defined. I remembered it was a full day. But why? My thoughts and the tape were interrupted by a noise downstairs. I put on my slippers and went to see what it was. The kitchen was a mess. We were in the middle of a storm, and the door latch was broken, the wind violently swinging it. Looking at the state of the metal, it was a miracle it had withstood the impact even minimally. I used the key to lock it and placed one of the shelves to block it. The cold that entered with it was enough to make my fingertips ache, as I gathered disarrayed dish towels and utensils from the floor. Once everything was back in place, I went back up to the tape.

*J: I took Peter to the bathroom inside the house while M\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ continued fishing with Francis.*

Francis? That name... it caused a strange tickle in my head.

*M: When they came back, Peter said he wanted to show Francis the swing he had made in the nearby woods. It was early, and we thought it wouldn't be a problem, so we allowed it, and...*

His voice was choked with tears.

*D: Hey, hey, Mr. M, it's okay. You couldn't have known...*

*M: The boys... the boys... went there. I told them to come back before it got dark. But only Peter came back.*

*D: Let's focus on that... How did he come back?*

*J: He was pale, looked like he had seen a ghost... and he was crying a lot. We asked him where his brother was, and he broke into tears.*

A lightning bolt echoed its light poetically. Brother? My head began to ache, my chest heaving as the air burned its way. Francis was my brother?

*D: For the record, the body of Francis Carlson was found two days later, showing signs of mutilation and torture. He was tied to a rock at the bottom of the lake; he fell victim to the serial killer known as The Biddenden Killer, a criminal whose modus operandi involves targeting twins, more specifically one of the siblings, leaving the other alive.*

Hold on, a twin brother? No... no... I grabbed my phone, typed the name, and found a strange private page with some information, strangly, my IP have permission to acess . The list of victims continued:

**Jane** (Dead in 1985) and **Jack Thompson** (Dead in 1995)

**Finn** (Dead in 1987) and **Ethan Miller** (Dead in 2000)

**James** (Dead in 1990) and **Charles Lewis** (Dead in 2006)

**Laura** (Dead in 2007) and **Vivian Turner** (Dead in 1991)

**Susan** (Dead in 2011) and **Erick White** (Dead in 1991)

**Olivia** (Dead in 1992) and **Bendith Harris** (Dead in 2015)

**Natalie** (Dead in 2020) and **Nathan Hall** (Dead in 1994)

There was no name of Francis? What? I scrolled down the page, "Methodology," "Arrest"...."Possible return."

*D: And did you see, the killer I mean, any clues?*

*J: No... We only know a few things that Peter told us. He said they were both playing on the swing when, behind a tree, a tall man dressed in black, wearing a clown mask, appeared, stretching his finger and making a sign, calling them... Peter was always the more frightened one, he said, while Francis approached the man, he returned to tell us. (she started crying)*

*M: We ran there immediately, but found no sign of Francis, only... the mask.*

*D: For the record, Mr. M just handed me the mask he found at the crime scene, a thin, cheap plastic mask found in children's stores. It is mostly white, with a red mouth and two eye holes, secured by an elastic band.*

While the recording played, almost passing straight through my ears, I focused on the topic "possible return," reading information about the most recent victims, the other siblings.

*D: I would also like to add a request for discretion with Peter. We are investigating a possible retaliation from the killer against the other siblings. Three months ago, the brother of his first victim, Jack Thompson, was killed shortly after giving an interview on a sensationalist program. This is the problem: everyone involved in this case is overexposed, well-known people that many know the whereabouts of. I would like to ask that this be kept as a police secret, at least until capture. Francis's death will be classified as accidental to disguise it, if you agree.*

A moment of silence.

*M: Alright... The psychiatrist said Peter went into shock, he probably won't remember either.*

*D: Well, that makes things easier. I'll send a copy of this recording to you for the record. It's better to keep Peter away from this.*

The sound of the lifeless tape began to echo. A chilly noise accompanied by the pouring rain as I tried to digest everything that had happened. Brother... a twin brother! Of course, how could I have forgotten Francis? I felt dizzy, my heart aching. I stood up, almost able to walk, staggering like a drunk towards the kitchen. I needed some water. I poured the cold liquid into the glass, its tingling against the edge of the cup. I drank in long sips, and just when I thought I would calm down, my eyes rested on the table:

A clown mask. Aged, almost colorless. It displayed a red mouth... and two eye holes. A note on a yellow post-it beside it displayed in bold letters: "Ready for hide and seek." Slowly, the creaking of the hallway cabinet door began to sound, and anxiety returned with twice the force. Hide and seek, the words hammered in my mind, reminding me of what the mysterious man had said that day... A hoarse voice echoed behind me, singing a strange song:

*Hide and seek, my little toy,*

*In the darkened woods, I weave the ploy.*

*The smiling mask, an invitation to pain,*

*Where brothers are lost, forever without gain.*

&#x200B;

*Jack found his end, amidst shadows and leaves,*

*Ethan unraveled, in the treacherous and swift waters*

*Charles lost his way, between twilight and dawn,*

*Gabriel disappeared, where the night made it known.*

&#x200B;

*Bendith perished, amid shattered dreams,*

*Erick danced, in the darkness of sealed laments.*

*Francis is gone, in the shadows of the somber lake*

*Now, why doesn't little Peter join him?*

I ran as fast as I could while this song echoed. When I was close to reaching the exit, I saw that now, finally, the lake was flooded. My car, half the chassis submerged. I couldn't leave. As the footsteps followed me, I had no choice but to go up to the second floor and lock myself in one of the rooms. Now, I'm here, waiting for the police to somehow appear in time. Through the crack, I've already seen the tall, masked figure passing a few times... and I think he already knows where I am.
