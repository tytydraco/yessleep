Before I start, I wrote this as much for myself rather than who might read it. The long and the short of it is after a group therapy session, someone in the pub suggested writing it down. If I’m honest writing has always been a painful experience for me so depending on if it makes me feel better I might share the rest in a few weeks. 



I can’t say I grew up in houses like the one he owned. But I’d be lying if I said they weren’t part of my childhood. They were the kind in half-mile long terraces covered in this thick blood red paint you don’t see anymore. They lined pothole ridden streets, seemingly uncared for since they were new. I couldn’t remember if other windows had always been covered in metal grates and wooden boards, or if the grass always grew so long between the paving stones. But they’d been like that so long a visitor might think the council had drawn the weeds and collapsed rotting doors in the blueprint. But in that forgotten mess, Uncle Stu’s house stood with crisp panes of glass in old metal frames and painted yellow wooden door.  



Of course he wasn’t really my uncle. A relative yes, but not one you’d class as close on the family tree. He’d been present at family gatherings: a great grandmother’s 90th here, a cousin’s christening there. He’d have a joke to tell, a fact to share or advice to give to my dad on keeping the car running another year. He drove an old reliant, that special car with three wheels you used to see old miners like him drive. I had an old memory of us playing with his hand cranked car acting like it was a propellor plane. Years later, my dad told me there was no chance of a car like that running in the 1990s and for a while I almost forgot he existed. 



It wasn’t until I heard he was having trouble getting in and out of his house that I nailed down that he was my grandma’s brother. My sister rang me one night asking if I could check in on him. He’d had a Facebook account he used to post memes he didn’t understand or unwittingly share racist dog whistles about phantom law or army vets not getting served at the super-market. But out of the blue he’d dropped her a message on what was likely a lonely evening asking her how she was. He found out quickly that she’d moved to the US after graduating university and was working as a researcher at Columbia with a handsome husband and a kid on the way. I was the second option. 



Now I didn’t have a bad relationship with my sister or anything. We were just in different places in life. I’d moved down to London while she was still doing her Masters and our parents had died in their 50s – as much as it pains me to say it there wasn’t much of a story to tell you there apart from a few careers taking hours they’d never get back. With that and the 5-hour time difference we didn’t talk much, and she wasn’t to know I was homeless when I got the message. 



Not the hobo kind of homeless. Moreso the kind with a middling tech job who’d gotten too used to his boyfriend with a top-level tech job paying for the flat in Zone 1 for 5 years. Then when you’d spent the last year growing progressively more tired and angry at each other, you take the plunge and split up 3 weeks before Christmas. Then you realise the only friends you didn’t make through him are a couple expecting a baby on the edge of the overground. They’re people you care about, but you’ve not shared a moment alone since you were 19 waiting for a party to start. 



Not particularly looking forward to room hunting and paying half my income for the privilege, I dropped Stu a message telling him Sarah had been in touch. Feeling manipulative and having omitted certain truths, I’d soon sorted free accommodation ‘for a while’. All the time telling myself, I’d pay for the inconvenience through housework and a stairlift. 



I worried about the cost of a stairlift throughout my drive up North but aside from that, I was convinced the move would be positive. There was an office in Sheffield and colleagues from the area seemed to perpetually work remotely anyway. Then again, I wasn’t too sure whether Grindr was much of a thing anymore or if the men of South Yorkshire would be into a 37 year-old bear looking for excitement in the box room of a geriatric Brexiteer. 



It was surprising I even found the place. I’d not even asked his address by the time I got in the car so pinged him an IM and waited for a reply. After waiting a few minutes, I realised he probably assumed his address was written in a faux leather notebook I didn’t own and decided to just set off anyway. I figured it was close to my grandparents’ old houses so stuck that address in maps. 



I felt pensive as I left the motorway about quarter of an hour away. It was a cold, foggy, mid-December day where daylight wasn’t lasting long. The heating from the houses pumped steam into the street giving everything a smoky look as I passed through a town I’d not visited in well over a decade. Some of the shops signs had changed, others had not, others were empty.  



I stopped a few hundred yards from the house. I tried to ignore the visible changes to the exterior, the invisible changes I imagined and the teenager taking the bins to the curb – too young to have been born when we’d sold that empty house. The instructions Stu gave me were cryptic relying on a familiarity I no longer had with the town. 



They took me passed old, assisted living council flats – green panelled with white handlebars leading to the door just like great grandma used to have. Soon I found the “Road Closed” sign Stu had told me about and I ignored it as instructed. I drove through the streets slowly, trying to avoid destroying the suspension of the car I didn’t take enough care of. The streets weren’t marked on Maps, the weeds grew and the windows were boarded just as I remembered them. Yet with the daylight gone, artificial orange light still shone through a few of them. 



I was barely 10 feet away when my lights hit the first of them. A figure came into view so quickly through the fog I had to slam the brakes. It was a woman neither young nor old with bright blonde hair facing away from me standing in the middle of the road, wearing nothing but a pink dressing gown. 



‘Excuse me’, I asked. Using all the polite irritation I could in my inflection. ‘Excuse me!’ I raised my voice after a few seconds without response. 



She turned round slowly, nonplussed by my presence and breathing out a puff of smoke. I saw her gently usher two previously unseen kids out the way. The three of them, totally expressionless didn’t break eye contact with me the whole time. 



Thinking nothing of it, I drove past and spotted a black plaque reading ‘No. 58’ I remembered from distant memory. I smiled at the familiarity of it and parked the car at the side of the road. I got out to knock on the door realising mine was the only car on the road. I heard an old voice grunt ‘come in’ from his living room and opened the door. 



The smell of Lambert & Butler cigarettes and the nicotine tinged wallpaper took me back to the days spent playing with yellow stained Lego in my grandma’s living room. All the while my mum shared a cigarette with her just round the corner pretending she’d never touched one in her life. His house wasn’t dirty per se, just from a different time. 



I stepped through the hallway and into the living room to see Stu sat with his old green easy chair dropping his ash into the tray next to him. He certainly didn’t look like a man struggling to get out the house. Time had given him a belly, but his arms had stayed sinewy from years down the pits. His hands were calloused and strong, only a smattering of soot away from being fresh from a day’s work. He wore an old grey t-shirt and brown slacks. His face had stayed remarkably smooth even if darkened from age barring the deep crow’s feet and looser skin around his neck and chin. Most of his hair was white but even then there was a strangely distinguished black colouring on his scalp with a blend of grey hairs which only receding mildly by his temples. Honestly, he looked better than my parents had done even with thirty years more on him than they’d ever get. 



‘Hello there lad!’ he beamed with reassuring recognition and a rasp unique to this part of the world. Leaving his cigarette in the tray, he leaned forward and pressed the arms of the chair with a bit of a groan and stood up. I started forward, expecting him to collapse under his own weight but any stiffness had gone in the two or three steps. He gave me the sort of handshake that reverberates up your arm and into your shoulder while you desperately try to look unfazed by it. 



‘It’s been a long time ‘asn’t it David?’, he sat forward in his chair, ‘I think I last saw ya at Jan’s funeral.’ I told him I thought it probably was. Grandma had outlasted my mum unfortunately, if not by much. I’d seen a lot of Stu in that stretch about 10 years ago, usually with us standing awkwardly outside a crematorium. 



I sat down on the settee opposite him while he went into the kitchen to make a cup of tea. Shouting back the kinds of questions only someone over 60 hold a genuine interest in ‘what way’d you come then?’ took up a few minutes while I tried to make a conversation out of a 170 mile drive up a straight road. But when he came in, passing me an old Sheffield Wednesday mug that might have been worth something to the right buyer I realised he’d remembered exactly how I took my tea. 



‘So you married then are you David?’ 



The question threw me. Why would I be staying here if I was married? If I was, it’d probably be the result of a nasty fight. I thought about telling him about Robert and what’d happened before I realised he might not even know I was gay. Not being quite sure how this smiling old man who’d known me since I was a child would react, I just said: ‘no’. I changed the subject ‘Have you eaten yet Stu?’ 



His smile relaxed a bit under the strain of the thought and he crumpled the side of his face slightly. ‘Don’t think so’, he replied looking down towards his stomach deep in thought. 



‘You hungry?’ I asked him as I stood up to walk towards the kitchen. 



His smile returned, ‘how long you staying for? You don’t need to trouble yourself?’ I froze in place thoughts racing about whether I was going to end up on the street tonight out of sheer fear of reminding him the night’s arrangements. He stared back at me quite blankly before bursting out laughing. ‘No don’t worry about cooking I’ll sort it’. I wasn’t convinced he’d started out with a joke in mind but I wasn’t going to complain. I was curious what he actually had to eat in, so I insisted on taking the empty cups into the kitchen and cleaning up.  



The lounge had been fairly tidy, but I wasn’t too impressed by the state of the kitchen. All very old fittings with an oven with a gas hob that might charitably have been referred to as vintage. Along the worn wooden worktops were strewn endless papers, most of which had hastily written etchings of the letter ‘R’ that would confused archaeologists of the future if ever found. I washed up the many empty cups while I heard the sound of his lighter from the other room, and him taking the first drag of another cigarette. 



Checking the fridge, I only found three open bottles of milk probably also from meals on wheels; two of them were already sour. The freezer was in pretty much the same state but I managed to find a Chicken Kiev each and enough chips from a mix of a few bags. I decided to make him another cup of tea to return the favour and walked back in. 



‘Here you go Stu,’ I said as I passed him the cup. ‘So erm... I’m going to’, but he cut me off’. 



‘I take two sugars by the way.’ 



I apologised and fixed my error. ‘I’m going to get my stuff in from the car before it gets dark Stu.’ I continued from before. ‘Where should I put my stuff?’ 



‘Spare bedroom lad.’ He replied, ‘you’ll have to move some bits and bobs though mind.’ 



I went back out to the car, and started to unload my suitcase, three boxes of personal belongings and my guitar – quite a meagre showing for my time so far on the planet.  



On my final trip heard a young voice out of my eyeline say quite firmly ‘Y’alright rock-a-bye junior?’ I looked up to see three boys on bikes, the oldest of which was maybe about ten or eleven years old.  



‘Hi’, I replied. Before continuing with what I was doing. I heard giggling from their direction as I turned away. I turned slightly to see what was happening to see them quickly stop. The eldest of the boys whispered something to the other two and they rode off further into the estate. 



Thinking nothing of it, I locked the car again and went inside to take my stuff upstairs. Stu was right, there was a lot of stuff that needed moving. Boxes of his own, and general junk that looked like it had been thrown in that tiny second bedroom on and off for probably longer than I’d been alive. I could just about make out a bed beneath the boxes by the window with sheets that probably hadn’t been changed since before the millennium. 



‘So I brought a lot of stuff with me Stu,’ I started, ‘I don’t need all of it straight away but it’s going to feel a little close in that spare room if I don’t find it a home.’ 



Stu shrugged. ‘Aye yeah, it needs sorting it does. Stick some stuff up in’ loft. I don’t mind what it is. Not used ‘spare room in years.’ 



Letting out a relaxed breath, I smiled, ‘Is there a ladder up there in the loft?’ 



‘Oh no, 'tis a step latter on’ wardrobe in my room.’ 



His room was neat if not a little spartan. A double bed I hadn’t expected, and the same set of curtains from the rest of the house, looking a bit more as intended without any ash trays in here. My eye was also drawn to a nice-looking mahogany dressing table topped with some well-polished glass ornaments and an expensive looking mirror with gold-plated rims. 



I found the step ladder quickly, even if I did nearly fall backwards and cause myself 7 years bad luck. It creaked open shedding the remains of a painting project from a bygone age. The hatch to the loft was just at the top of the stairs, the ladder fitting so perfectly in that corner in front of ‘my’ room that I was convinced Stu must have measured it out before buying it. The hatch itself was an old sturdy sheet of plywood, so sturdy I was worried it was blocked off.  



Climbing in once it was open I could just about stand up in the centre of the loft. There was no light up there making it impossible to tell where the walls began. Shining my phone’s torch revealed a darkness that didn’t seem to end. There were no walls up here. I could even see the hatch for the house next door. 



I felt somewhat uncomfortable. I went back down the ladder to assess my options. I’d have to navigate several obstacles just to get to bed that night if I did nothing. But while a few of the boxes already up there were open, they seemed otherwise unperturbed. 



It took me a few minutes to get a few boxes up there. The soot from old chimney smoke rising up whenever I moved anything leaving my hands and clothes covered in it after a moment. I’d just dropped down a box of guitar pedals when I heard a crack beneath me. I froze, feeling like I was about to fall through the boards, but then the sound started again. Not a crack, but a knock. Deep in the darkness. I took a breath inwards ready to get straight out of there when my phone buzzed telling me the Chicken Kievs were ready. 



I had enough time to wash the soot off my hands and change my clothes. We watched TV for a few hours until I realised how tired I was getting. I managed to clear the bed and took a shower before settling under those predictably musty sheets. Before I slept, I dropped my sister a message and told her what had happened; that I wasn’t sure he was expecting me or not but his meals on wheels seemed to have been cancelled that day. 



I slept like a log for the first few hours until something above me woke me up. It sounded a little like scratching. I ignored it at first but after a minute or so it started it again. It was coming from the loft. 



Rats, I assumed. Frustrated, I sat up in bed and started thinking about what else I could do with my stuff in the morning. I was halfway through waiting for details of a self-storage container to load on my phone when I heard a clear CLUNK from above.  I didn’t like that. 



I stood up feeling poised, trying to keep my breathing slow. Nothing seemed to happen for a minute or two and the heat at the back of my head started to subside, but it didn’t last. As I sat back down on the bed, I remembered the knock from before. I checked the time on my phone: 01:23am. 



It must have been old wood with new weight on it I told myself, until I heard the clunk move closer to me. I threw a shirt on and stepped on onto the landing and closed the door behind me as quietly as I could. 



I took a tentative step onto the stairs expecting to hear a creak beneath my feet. But the sound came from above. 



A scrape of what sounded like a wheel went across the loft hatch and as I looked up I could see the vibration of the plywood panel as it passed over and onto the boards of the loft. 



I stopped in place. My chest was now totally tight.  



My reasoning now was that I had no idea what I’d find downstairs, but what I did know was that my room had only me and the boxes when I’d woken up. I stepped backwards onto the landing forgetting that I’d closed the bedroom door behind me until I felt the cold metal of the doorhandle on my skin. 



Startled I turned around only to see a hulking figure in the corner of my eye. 



Without my glasses and in the dark, I couldn’t tell much about it but I knew that even my respectable frame wasn’t going to match what I saw. 



‘David?’ the figure said shallowly, almost quizzically.  



My throat was tight. ‘Yes Stu.’ I breathed, ‘it’s me’. 



His normal voice returned. ‘What are you doing up?’ 



‘Did you hear the sounds up there?’ I was starting to collect myself. 



He left a silence before saying flatly, ‘oh yes.’ He turned round to go back to bed ‘just a bit of unfinished business from the mine’.
