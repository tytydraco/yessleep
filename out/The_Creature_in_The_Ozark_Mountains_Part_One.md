Hi everyone, This is something I've been putting off telling anyone for a while now and after last night I think now is the time. I apologize for my writing I've never done this before but a friend told me this is the place to tell my story.

So a month ago I moved into a old cabin I bought in the middle of the Ozark mountains. It's a beautiful little piece of land where I thought I could get away from the rest of the world. My own little garden of Eden. Turns out it might just be the opposite. The first night there everything was normal I spent the day unpacking and exploring the near by woods. There is a small stream at the south end of the property that has a decent amount of Fish, Frog, and other tiny wildlife that live in and around it. I felt that I finally found what I was looking for. When I got back to the cabin I had dinner and got ready for bed. It was around 10:45 when I fell asleep. I woke up about 7:30 the next day got ready and eat breakfast and start out to do some work around the property. There was a old shed to the left of the cabin that I need to clean out because the previous owners had left stuff in there. My guess is that they were old and couldn't take care of themselves anymore and sold the cabin so they could move to senior living. I don't really know for sure but there was a lot of old Elves Presley records and so of those barn animal porcelain figures that are common in a Midwestern house. When I was done it was late in the afternoon and that was when I noticed that there wasn't any sound coming from the woods no birds singing. No squirrels moving through the trees. Not even the sound of the stream running through the rocks pure silence.

That's when I heard something well not really heard it but felt it. A low hum was coming from all around me. It felt like when a air plane is flying really low to the ground. It felt so much like that that I looked up only to see nothing not even a cloud in the sky. For about 5 minutes I only felt that low humming and as soon as it came it was gone. All the sound came back all at once like it never even left. I just stood there trying to figure if that actually did happen. I decided that it was all in my head and went back inside the cabin. When I got inside I couldn't help but feel like something was watching me. No matter where I was in the cabin it felt like I wasn't alone. That feeling stayed until it was time for me to go to sleep.

On day three I had to go into town which was a small town about a hour away. It was a nice little town that had maybe 30 people living in it. It had a small store a post office and a small church. I went to the store because I need to get more food. And while I was in there everyone was just staring at me some even stop dead in their tracks just to stare. I started to get weirded out so I quickly finished my shopping and got out of there. The moment I got back to my truck I could still see everyone still inside staring at me. That when the town Reverend came up and induced himself he said "Well You must be new around here my name is Father Willard Nice to meet you" I induced myself and asked him why everyone was acting so weird and jester towards the store where I could still see everyone looking at me. He answered "Well it just might because that we don't get very much visitors" I said that makes sense but that still didn't make me feel any better about it. He said "So where you staying at" I told him I just bought that old cabin up the mountain and with that his face went from a bright cheerful smile to a dark and gloomy frown. He quickly made some comment about not wanting to keep me to long and speed off.

After that I got back to the cabin put away my groceries and sat down on my couch. Only for that feeling of being watched to come back. I sat there for awhile just looking around until I swear out of the corner of my eye. I could see someone or something watching me from the tree line through the window that faced where the stream was. What I saw was a tall dark silhouette of what looked like a man cross with a wolf. With arm that almost touched the ground. The moment I turned to get a better look it was gone. Then that low humming started again. When that started I got up and double check that every door and window was locked. When I got to the window I saw that thing from the humming stopped. And all the sound came back just like before. At this time the sun started to set so I just went to bed. But not before making sure my door was locked and the bathroom window was too.

Nothing really happened for the next three days. I just did some errands and made sure to get a PO box at the post office. So I'm going to leave this story here I come back and tell the rest in a part two.
