“Non Compos Mentis,” I said.

“What does that mean, Dr Li?” Alex asked.

“To not be in one’s right mind,” I answered. “So, what do you think of my challenge? It’s a fun thought experiment. Alex, you’d argue that humans must be born insane. Mason, you would argue that environmental factors affect a person’s sanity. In other words, we’re talking about nature versus nurture.”

“How does that link to Critical Thinking?” Alex queried.

“How does it not?” Mason spat.

The three of us were packed into my minuscule office like boxed crickets, chattering noisily. To an outsider, our conversation would've been a grating cacophony of nonsense. It practically sounded that way to me. I hated those meetings with Alex and Mason. There was no other option, of course. I had limited availability in my schedule, so I put students in pairs for monthly catch-ups, but I would’ve rather skipped the meeting between those two boys entirely. In fact, I would’ve expelled Mason Stokes from my class, if that were allowed.

He was an unsettling young man. A twenty-year-old child. One with the pungent, putrid air of unearned importance that wafts from so many university students. Mason was the sort of boy who lived in a fantasy. Everyone else simply formed the backdrop to his world.

“I see your point, Alex. Well, in this week’s lecture, we were talking about fallacies,” I said. “Fallacious arguments are, certainly, frustrating. But the fact of the matter is that such reasoning — or lack of reasoning — seeps into each and every aspect of our daily lives. We all have unfounded biases. Unfounded beliefs. And, ridiculous as it seems, those unfounded beliefs sometimes win arguments. Often win arguments, actually. Whether intentionally or unintentionally.”

“It goes against the basis of Critical Thinking,” Mason said, practically parroting the point Alex had been making.

“It does,” I agreed. “But that’s why we must discuss it. People decide winners of debates based on emotion, not reason. We see it with politicians, legal enforcers, and even teachers. That includes me. Yes, even I have biases. Even I make points that are unfounded. The thought experiment I proposed, for instance, might achieve nothing at all. I might be wrong in suggesting that we would learn something from such a debate. But wouldn’t it be fun to try? By learning to argue logically and illogically, you might better understand how to approach fallacious arguments. You might both become better at guiding people towards solutions in all walks of life. Business relationships, personal relationships, and so on.”

Mason smiled. “Sounds good to me. I clearly have the winning position. It’s a proven fact, of course, that people are born with mental illnesses and disorders that one might classify as ‘insanity’. No doubt about that. But it’s also proven that people can be driven to insanity. I don’t see how Alex would be able to refute that. It’s the truth.”

“The truth doesn’t matter, Mason,” I explained. “Winners are the ones who argue the most convincingly. It is not enough to be logical. One must be persuasive. So, persuade me. Both of you. Alex? Are you up for this?”

“Is it proven that people can be driven to insanity?” Alex asked Mason. “People who ‘snap’ may have always had poorly-wired minds.”

I smiled. “Well, you’ve responded, so I’ll take that as a ‘yes’. Continue, Mason.”

“This is ridiculous, Dr Li. What sort of argument is that? It hardly warrants a response,” Mason huffed.

“Would people agree with you?” I asked. “Is the entire world educated in Psychology?”

“No, and we’re included in that uneducated group,” The boy scowled. “We study Philosophy. Alex is no psychiatrist. Listening to his spouted drivel is infuriating.”

“The same could be said about you,” Alex shrugged.

“You’re both veering into ad hominem territory,” I warned. “This exercise is supposed to open your minds to the workings of both logical and illogical arguments. That is all. Let’s not digress into attacks on character. Okay?”

“Fine,” Mason growled. “We’re not psychologists. We’ve established that. But we have common sense, Alex. There are plenty of humans who are born perfectly sane, but life changes them. Through trauma, the mind can be ruined. Stop being obtuse. You know that people can be driven to insanity.”

“Do I?” Alex asked. “I know that people are born with mental illnesses, but you’ve not provided any evidence of mentally healthy people descending into madness. Perhaps all unwell people were born with an innate predisposition towards developing illness. It was always there. In the background.”

Mason’s eyes narrowed, and his face reddened. I saw that the boy, wilfully or not, didn’t understand the purpose of the experiment. He liked order and structure. We all did. That was the allure of my course — the allure of Critical Thinking in particular. However, Mason seemed unable to entertain the abandonment of logic for the sake of an exercise. He didn’t have the patience to tolerate an irrational opponent. I started to wish that I’d reversed the roles. Mason should’ve argued for Nature.

Perhaps the following disturbing events wouldn’t have happened.

A coldness spread across Mason’s face. A look that violently tore every shred of joy from my being, replacing it with horror. An expression that I’d never seen on his face before, but somehow I recognised it. As if I’d always glimpsed it beneath the surface of his ill-fitting mask.

“Neither of us have evidence, Alex. I’ll say it one more time. We’re not psychiatrists. We haven’t done research. We don’t have any data or statistics to support our points. We’re going in circles,” Mason explained robotically.

“I don’t know what you mean, Mason. I was telling the truth. Weren’t you? I did my research. Just concede if you have nothing else to say,” Alex shrugged.

I smiled. “I’m certainly leaning towards Nature.”

“Well, you’re a moron,” Mason growled.

“We’ve talked about this in the past, Mason. You need to learn to control your temper,” I sighed. “We’ll call it a day because you’re clearly not engaging with the task. People pay attention to emotion. That was what this debate was supposed to demonstrate. You would’ve been able to argue your point well if you’d remained calm and taken the time to think, Mason.”

“I’m not a psychiatrist!” Mason cried. “This is nonsense… Non Compos Mentis? What nonsense. None of us know anything about that. Not even you, doctor.”

I removed my spectacles and rubbed my eyes. “You're right, Mason. Alex’s argument was filled with gaping holes. It lacked substance. Unlike you, however, he never showed his hand. In life, you won’t always be arguing about speciality subjects. If you have the ability to argue for a position about which you know very little, you have the power to argue for a position about which you know a lot. You will face many pigheaded people in this world. People far ruder and far less logical than Alex. Will you crumble when they spout nonsense too? Or will you remain level-headed, state your points clearly, and work towards solving problems? Making the world better?”

“I will remove myself from foolish situations,” Mason hissed, rising to his feet.

The student took meaningful strides towards the exit, but he unexpectedly stopped to turn and smile at me.

“Do you really believe that a person cannot be driven insane, Dr Li?” He asked softly.

I sighed. “It was a thought experiment, Mason. This wasn’t a personal attack.”

And before he left, the young man said something which frightened me in a way I didn’t understand.

“I wager it would only take five tweaks to unspool the threads of your mind.”

I thought about those words later that evening. Whilst my wife slept soundly beside me, I lay and stared at the ceiling. Thought of the many times that Mason Stokes had said or done things to leave me with an uneasy sensation in my gut. That was why his parting words had struck such an ominous chord. My suspicion about the boy’s mental instability was backed by a year of supporting evidence.

Something was deeply wrong with Mason Stokes, but the ‘Non Compos Mentis’ debate was the catalyst for the hellish events that would follow. It took a while for that to become clear, however.

Mason Stokes stopped coming to lectures. He quit university, and I quickly forgot all about him. Moved on with my life. I’m starting to think that may well have been his plan. Lulling me into a false sense of safeness. The strangeness began in January, nearly two years after the man’s unnerving tantrum.

“Is something funny?” I huffed, spinning around.

I faced a lecture hall of bewildered students, and my eyes rapidly scanned the people in the room. I was searching for the culprit. The giggling young man or woman. The one who’d been chuckling whilst my back was turned and stopping whenever I eyed the students. Like a stuttering engine that taunted me.

“This is very disruptive!” I shouted. “Please, whoever’s laughing, stop it. Or, at the very least, tell the rest of us what you find so amusing.”

Like clockwork, as soon as I returned my gaze to the blackboard, the ethereal snickering resumed. It seemed to be pouring from the very walls.

I groaned loudly. “Look, will you just–”

“– We hate it too,” Olivia interrupted.

“Yeah, we don’t know who’s laughing,” Megan added. “It’s annoying for everyone.”

I nodded dejectedly. “You know what? It’s nearly midday. We’ll stop there. I’ll upload the notes later, and our chuckling friend is free to laugh heartily at David Hume’s thoughts on empiricism. It is, clearly, mankind’s most comedic piece of literature. Who knew?”

That night, I worked at the university until ten in the evening. It was Friday night. Or, as I liked to call it, ‘Admin Night’. My least favourite time of the week. I would panic and hurriedly complete a ginormous list of administrative tasks in the space of a few hours. Things I should’ve done earlier in the week. The plight of the procrastinator, made worse by the isolation of an empty building in the middle of winter. And, on this particular night, the horror multiplied with a single sound.

A meek, muted laugh from the darkness.

I froze, and my eyes shot to the door of my cramped office. The office in which I’d held that meeting with Mason and Alex, two years earlier. The corridor beyond my door was partly obscured by the patterned glass of the window pane, but I could see enough. There was nobody outside. Still, the clarity of the chuckle was undeniable. The sheer loudness. It sounded as if it had come from the other side of my door.

“Hello?” I feebly called.

There was, of course, no response. And I knew that I recognised the laugh. The unmistakeable giggle that had filled my lecture hall earlier in the day.

I still had unfinished work, but I was no fool. I wasn’t going to spend a second longer in that place. I packed my things, before scurrying into the corridor. And I quickly realised that I’d never noticed something before. The quiet of the building after sunset. The emptiness of those deep cavities that the scarce lighting didn’t reach, in hollow nooks and crannies of the corridor. On that night, however, stalked by a disembodied voice, the terror of the place finally tunnelled into my mind. I finally realised that I was alone.

No. Worse, perhaps. I *wasn’t*.

As I pressed the button for the lift at the end of the corridor, it sounded again. The giggle that seemed to have no source. Unbound by a human body. It reverberated from the walls, carrying with far too much sound and weight to have stemmed from a physically-present person.

When I turned around, I expected to see a person slinking into the darkness. A petrifying stalker, lurking in the shadows. But I saw nobody, and that was far more terrifying.

Uttering a shriek, I squeezed my shivering form through the lift’s doors before they’d fully opened. And then I repeatedly hammered the button for the ground floor, wondering why the mechanics of the lift seemed to clunk and clang at such a glacial pace. I was too afraid to make a sound or move a muscle. Inching towards unconsciousness, slithering floaters filling my eyes as I refused to inhale or exhale.

When the doors eventually started to close, I allowed myself the privilege of drawing a deep breath. I tried to convince myself that I’d seen some silhouette of a person in the distant darkness of the corridor, but I didn’t. It was simply a cosy lie. Preferable to the frightening alternative.

The possibility that there had been nobody in the building but me.

After a sleepless night and concerned questions from my family, I finally caved. I told my wife and my daughter about the strangeness of the day. That was how I undersold it. ‘A strange day’. My wife talked about the potential of a stalker. A disgruntled colleague or student.

That was what sparked an idea in my mind. Not just the memory of that argument, two years earlier, but the memory of something that had happened only a few weeks earlier.

I’d seen him in one of my lectures. Mason Stokes. A boy who didn’t attend that university any longer. Before I had a chance to ask what he was doing, Mason had risen from his seat. I wanted to say something as he left the room, but I was too stunned to speak.

Why would he return after disappearing on such a sour note? Why, after so long?

It all made sense as I reflected on the day of giggling. It *had* to be him. After all, I hadn’t imagined the sound. Students had heard it too. It wasn’t in my head.

“You might be right, Jane,” I agreed. “Remember that aggressive student from a couple of years ago? Mason Stokes?”

My wife nodded. “Yes, I remember. The one you said might be a psychopath. Do you think he’s been harassing you today?”

I shrugged. “He’s the only person I’ve ever angered enough to warrant such a response. And I spotted him in my lecture hall a few weeks ago. That seems far too coincidental.”

Jane rubbed my back affectionately. “If you see him again, Zimo, you really need to call the police. It’s harassment.”

“I know. It’s strange though…” I continued. “I didn’t see him anywhere today. I checked every face in the lecture hall. Checked every corner of the office corridor. I heard the laughing, but… there was no sign of him.”

“You’ll have to tell Richard on Monday,” Jane said. “He’ll check the CCTV for you.”

“Have you thought about the possibility that he might’ve used a set of speakers?” My daughter asked. “He might’ve hidden something in the lecture hall and the corridor.”

I rubbed my chin thoughtfully. “That would actually explain some things, Clair. The voice was incredibly loud. Too loud to be natural.”

With that explanation, my stomach settled a little, and I sought to enjoy a relaxing weekend with my wife and daughter. The two people whose laughs didn’t send ripples of fear down my spine.

The giggling didn’t follow me into my home, and it didn’t return on Monday either. I still thought about it, of course. Thought about the possibility of that odd young man following me. The possibility of his eyes upon me. Hidden somewhere. My nerves had settled a little, but not entirely. I had a permanent hunch in my back, unwilling to lower my guard for a moment.

Over the weekend, I’d been living in a bubble. A bubble which burst as soon as I returned to work and saw all of the locations that had haunted me on Friday. Mason didn’t need unearthly giggles to strike my heart with fear. The fear of being watched and stalked was sufficient. The fear cycle was perpetuated by my own mind. Memories of Friday’s trauma.

“Zimo?”

It took a few seconds to realise that Dr Atkinson was talking to me. I averted my gaze from the office window, which overlooked a small courtyard, and eyed the lecturer before me. We were sitting in a common area for lecturers and tutors. It was ten in the morning. Not exactly the prime time for a break, so the two of us were the only members of staff in the room.

“Sorry, Jennet. What were you saying?” I asked.

She smiled. “You’ve seemed a little quiet this week. Are you okay?”

“Yeah. I just…” I paused. “Yeah. Did Patrick tell you about what happened on Friday?”

“Ah. I assumed you might be thinking about that,” Jennet said. “God, I remember Mason Stokes… He was a very disturbing boy. He said things that set my hair on end. Did you tell Richard that you saw him in your lecture hall a few weeks ago?”

I nodded. “Yeah. There’s not a lot he can do. Mason hasn’t shown his face this week, so that’s something. Maybe he’s… given up. He’s pranked me. Got his revenge.”

“Very optimistic,” Jennet replied. “One thing I remember about Mason is that he was focused. Determined. No matter how stubborn he seemed. Y’know, he once derailed one of my lectures to argue, for a good twenty minutes, with another boy. And afterwards, in the corridor, there was almost a physical altercation between them. Incited by Mason, of course.”

I shrugged. “Truthfully, I guess I hope that I’ve given him the reaction he wanted. He managed to frighten me, so…”

I trailed off, and my eyes locked onto the window again. A blur of motion appeared for a half-second, racing past the frosted pane. A descending blur that my mind didn’t sharpen until a few moments later.

A body had fallen past the window.

I screamed, knocking my chair over as I leapt up. Jennet spun around, facing the window in an effort to see what had horrified me. She spoke as I rushed forwards, but I heard only a dull ringing as I unlatched the window and stared down.

On the grassy carpet at the foot of the building, I was horrified to see nothing. No mangled corpse. No blood or guts. Just an empty courtyard. As if there had been no falling body. But there had been a body. I’d seen it.

Hadn’t I?

“Zimo!” Jennet cried. “What on Earth is wrong? What are you doing? I don’t… I don’t see anything…”

I was hyperventilating as I supported myself on the windowsill and tried to process whatever I’d seen. Or not seen. It was a brisk, cold morning in January. Obviously, there was nobody in the courtyard. A small patch of land around the rear of an unpopular building. There was nobody to could confirm or deny what had or hadn’t happened.

I didn’t explain myself to Jennet. I cancelled my lectures and tutorials for the day. Then I proceeded to inspect every square inch of the deserted courtyard, but I still found no sign of a body. Even upon closer inspection. But I tried to calm my mind. I thought about how uneasy I’d been that morning. That entire week. I decided that I’d seen a bird, perhaps. Such a startle might’ve caused my jittery brain to imagine something greater. Something far worse.

Believe it or not, I summoned the courage to return to work the following day. However, it happened a second time. Again, with no fanfare, nor witnesses. Late at night, following a long day at work, I was driving along a country lane near my home. As I passed the old farmhouse at the mid point of the road, my eyes were drawn to something. A man who stood atop the barn. A silhouette against the moonlit sky. Without warning, he toppled over the edge of the building, falling out of sight.

I yelled, losing control of my car for a brief moment and veering into a nearby hedge.

Fortunately, it was no major accident. I wasn’t hurt. The front bumper bore a few scratches from the entanglement of brambles, but I didn’t care about anything other than the scene I’d just witnessed. This time, I couldn’t dismiss it as a bird. It had been a man. Clearly visible, even at that late hour. So, I immediately drove to the farmer’s house, and I hurried to his front door.

Upon hearing my story, the alarmed farmer immediately grabbed his raincoat and worn boots. The old man and I searched the area around his barn, but we found nothing.

“Probably just kids,” He said gruffly. “Little shits are always muckin’ about on my land. Y’ever see ‘em again, let me know.”

It wasn’t kids. I knew what I’d seen.

Still, I didn’t want to alarm the man. I didn’t want to come across as crazy. Well, any crazier. I’d already sent the man on a wild goose chase at night, and I was aware that my claim was bizarre. A stranger hurling himself from the roof of a barn. What a tale. I’m surprised the farmer entertained me at all.

When I got home, I told Jane about everything that was happening. She, like me, said that my trauma was to blame. Since the previous Friday, I had been perpetually nervous. Seeing my stalker and his devious designs in everything and every place. I wanted to believe my wife. I wanted to believe I’d seen a bird, then a mischievous trespasser on a farm. But I didn’t believe it. Not even a little.

In all honesty, after what happened a few weeks later, I didn’t know what I believed anymore.

February 21st, 2024. I used to pick up my daughter from school on Wednesdays, so I could take her to ballet lessons, and this day was no different. I waited on the opposite side of the road, and Clair walked out of the double doors at three o’clock, offering an energetic wave when she spotted me. I started to lift my hand, preparing to wave back, but a stream of stagecoaches surged forwards, separating us.

I smirked as I thought about how amusing it would be for Clair to see me sitting there, hand frozen in a raised position, once the queue of buses finally passed. Thirty seconds later, however, the smile fell from my face.

Clair was gone.

I shifted in my seat, surveying the front of the school. Initially, I wondered whether my daughter had simply skirted around the buses. She might’ve found another way to the car. After a few minutes of waiting, however, I decided to ring her. The call was answered swiftly.

“Clair?” I said. “Where did you go?”

I wasn’t answered by a voice. Just the low hum of an engine and muffled traffic.

“Clair?” I cried, sensing that something was horribly off. “CLAIR?”

Somebody hung up, and I knew it wasn’t my daughter.

I tried calling again, but nobody answered. After ten minutes of attempting to reach her, I dialled 999 and reported something horrible. Unthinkable. The words tasted metallic in my mouth.

“I think somebody… has taken my daughter…”

February and March passed. Slowly. Quickly. I wouldn’t know. I remember very little of that time. Jane and I were permitted long bereavement periods from our employers, but we didn’t look after ourselves. Didn’t look after each other. My wife spent most of her time in bed. Sobbing profusely, refusing to open the curtains. I’d order food when I had the mental energy to do so, but she barely ate. The woman I loved became an emaciated shell, screaming every time she saw me, then apologising in floods of tears.

“I don’t blame you…” She whispered one time.

An unprompted line. Telling me, without a doubt, that she must have blamed me to some degree. And I blamed myself. It is impossible for a parent to do otherwise. Clair had been in my line of sight, and then she hadn’t. How do I put it into words? The sensation of not only losing a child, but knowing she still exists out there. Or doesn’t.

Both options were terrifying. Our daughter was dead or worse. No idea provided relief. Jane and I were grieving, whether Clair had survived or not. Grieving as we imagined all of the terrible things that had happened to her. Realising that we might grieve forever. We might never receive any closure.

By early April, the bills started to feel a little more intimidating. My employer didn’t push me to return, but Jane’s boss, being a cold-hearted bank manager, had run out of grace. He fired her. And, whatever the case, we were rapidly burning through the emergency fund on daily takeaways and petrol. I spent most days driving around the area. Searching for Clair, I told myself. In reality, I was clearing my head. Doing something. Anything to pretend that my thoughts hadn’t become erratic. Unpredictable.

The reality of our declining health became unavoidable. We had both fallen quite sick. The result of eating and sleeping poorly. Still, my wife was in a worse state than me. I knew I had to return to work, but I was afraid. Not afraid of returning to reality. If anything, I prayed it might provide a distraction from the thoughts in my fractured mind. I was afraid of leaving Jane alone.

Every day, I escaped from work as quickly as possible, and returned home to take care of Jane. Jennet Atkinson was a wonderful source of aid during that time. She covered all of my administrative work. She even did some of my marking.

And Dr Atkinson repeatedly told me that it was too soon to come back, but Jane and I were falling apart. I could’ve lived with my disintegration, but not the disintegration of my wife. I spent most of April forcing her out of the house. Dragging her down the road for the briefest walks imaginable. Anything to, at the very least, let her see sunlight.

“You need to look after yourself... for Clair,” I croaked. “She needs her mother to be well when she comes home.”

I thought Jane might yell at me for the emotional blackmail, but she didn’t. My wife actually started eating more than occasional bites of food. I joyously bawled the first time she finished a full meal. A Margherita. Nothing too nutritious or substantial, but it was a meal. It was progress. It told me that Jane believed, in some tiny part of her mind, that Clair would return. And that gave me hope too.

Hope that was crushed on May 1st, 2024. The day on which my descent into the land of insanity reached its end.

“I know you’ve been struggling,” Richard sighed. “However, this is *unacceptable*, Zimo. Absolutely unacceptable.”

I had no idea what the head of my department was talking about. When he showed me his monitor, my jaw dropped. Richard had received an email from an anonymous source. Attached, there was a video with a recognisable face in the thumbnail. My face. What I didn’t recognise, however, was the scene the video depicted.

Richard pressed play, and a ten-second clip displayed a damning scene of violence. A man on a mostly-abandoned city street raised his hands in fright as I relentlessly began to assault him. A vicious series of alternating left and right hooks, ending with the stranger’s collapse.

I gasped, mind swimming as I tried to process the horror of seeing myself do something that I simply hadn’t done.

Richard sighed. “The timestamp says it happened on Monday. Do you remember what happened on Monday night, Zimo?”

“What is this? A police interrogation?” I scoffed, realising that response made me sound incredibly guilty. “I was at home! I was…”

*… drinking,* I silently remembered.

Since Clair’s disappearance, Jane and I had been drinking more than usual. I remembered that Monday’s nightcap, in particular, had left me with a particularly sore head on Tuesday. The heaviest pounding sensation of my life. I tried to recall the events of Monday evening, but I only saw a bottle of bourbon and a wall of blackness.

*Did… I do it?* I fearfully wondered.

“I’m sorry, Zimo… I know there are extenuating circumstances. With respect to your situation, I won’t forward this video to the police, but it wouldn’t be ethical for me to entirely turn a blind eye. I recommend that you hand in your resignation before Friday,” Richard said coldly.

“What?” I gasped. “You’re firing me?”

“I recommend that you hand in your resignation before Friday,” Richard repeated bluntly.

I returned home in a trance. Thinking less of my unemployment and more about the video Richard had shown me. Twice. No matter how closely I looked at the screen, my conclusion remained the same. It was me in the video. There was absolutely no doubt about it. No doubt in the eyes of my employer either.

I could’ve fought the situation, but rocking the boat might’ve pushed Richard overboard, and he would’ve dived into the depths of the police station. Jane needed me. Clair needed me. It would’ve been selfish to throw Richard’s gift in his face. So, fully believing that I had blacked out and assaulted a stranger, I thanked Richard for his discretion. He told me that he was sorry about Clair. He hoped that we would find peace soon, but told me that it might be best to distance myself from the world before doing something stupid.

“More stupid than this, I mean,” He clarified, nodding at the video on his screen.

There would be no more opportunities for me to do anything, however. I arrived home to find two police cars sitting on the driveway, and an ambulance was parked on the road behind them. An officer stood on my front porch with Mrs Black, our elderly next-door neighbour. They noticed me pulling onto the front lawn.

“Mr Li?” The officer asked as I climbed out of the car.

“What's happening?” I hoarsely croaked, marching towards the house.

“Mr Li, you… Let’s just talk for a moment…” The officer began.

I brushed past her, and she didn’t stop me.

“Zimo, dear…” Mrs Black trembled. “Please listen to the policewoman… I beg you…”

There were two officers standing in the main lobby, and they both hurried forwards, shooing me backwards.

“Wait… Sir…” One officer started.

It was too late. I’d already seen what they were trying to hide. The forensics team were marking items and taking photographs, but the scene remained untouched.

Jane was dangling from a rope she’d tied to the chandelier.

Tears stained her gaunt face, and her dead eyes were still open. Haunted by the final thing she saw. And I was haunted not only by the sight of my lifeless wife, but the horror which painted the walls. What she had clearly seen.

Hundreds of identical photographs. A copied picture of our daughter bound to a chair in a nondescript kitchen. Clair was only identifiable by her school uniform, as her entire face was mutilated beyond recognition. Given the motion blur of her body, it was apparent, most hauntingly, that she was still alive. Still alive when the photo was taken, at least. Just as it was clear, from her stretched mouth, that she had been screeching in unfathomable agony.

I remember very little from the weeks that followed. The weeks between then and now. I only remember fragments of events. Key markers on a timeline of terror. Firstly, I begged the police to research Mason Stokes. The boy I’d seen in my lecture hall at the start of the year, shortly before everything started. I told them about everything that had happened, and I said that I suspected him to be the tormentor. The kidnapper.

Less than ten minutes later, however, another detective informed me, after a brief search, that Mason Stokes committed suicide a year earlier.

I insisted otherwise. I tried to explain that I’d seen him in my lecture hall, but the words fell on disbelieving ears. I finally believed that it had all been Mason. It didn’t mean much by then, of course. I was already broken. After the nightmares and hallucinations worsened over the following days, I suffered a psychotic break. Police officers found me wandering a city street in the nude at midnight. I don’t remember how I ended up there.

I wasn’t arrested. After a brief examination, I was sectioned. For my own safety, I was told, but I was no danger to myself. I was no danger to anything or anyone. I had become a shell of myself. I don’t know why I’m speaking in the past tense. I’m worse now. And I know I’ll continue to worsen. I have nothing and nobody.

He won. Mason Stokes drove me to madness.

For now, that’s all. The doctor just told me that I’ve spent too long on the computer today. I’m fortunate that the ward allows patients internet access. It is a taunting slice of freedom in this prison of the body and the psyche. The prison that Mason must’ve gleefully envisioned, two years ago, when he promised to tweak my mind.
