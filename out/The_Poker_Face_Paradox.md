The relentless rain soaks through my winter jacket as I stare down at the empty street, every other option for shelter exhausted. True comfort is fleeting—like spotting a taxi: you see it, hope it stops, and even then, it’s only temporary and comes at a cost. I struggle up a rusty ladder, my right arm barely cooperating due to old fractures. The icy sheets of rain lash down, seeping through my jeans and the thick socks I’ve paired with my Crocs. The rooftop of this apartment building should offer some respite—a bench and overhang might shield me from the freezing downpour. But as I’m barely midway up, a piercing voice cuts through the darkness.

“Need a hand?”

I look down to see a strange man standing right below. His fur pants are soaked, and his cologne—a thick, animalistic stench like Tabasco sauce and castoreum—hangs heavily in the air.

“The cops are patrolling the area,” he says. “You’ll freeze or get arrested if you stay out here.”

No way, this place is my last resort. I can't lose it, too. I ignore him, willing to take the risk and climb up further, a pain jolts in my right arm as I have to lean on it. I can't sleep on the streets while it's covered in filthy, cold rain; I would get ill again.

“Hey,” he continues, and this time he steps back so I can get a closer look. He is of average height and slim-looking. “You can come with me. I’ll let you stay.”

I hesitate, sceptical of his approach, analyzing his calm and slightly feminine features. “Really?” I shout, “Patrolling here, too?” He nods. Then I make my way down, and he introduces himself as John but adds—in an attempt at humour, I think—that his friends call him Mr. Poker Face because he never shows any emotion. He glances at me blankly. “You say you got a place? I'm Jack,” I lie, forcing a grin.

I don’t like his look or his unsettling tone, but the cold shoots through to the bone, and I have nowhere else to go. I reluctantly follow him to his apartment, chatting about the dull nightlife and hellish weather. The hallway is dim, lit only by a flickering bulb that casts deep shadows on the walls.

Inside, the apartment is compact and shrouded in darkness. “The power's out,” he says. He gestures to the couch, which seems like the most stable spot I’ve had in weeks, maybe months. He hands me a glass of water, but I avoid drinking it because, despite his outward friendliness, he feels a bit off. Even if he does this nice thing, you never know. But I'm not judging too hard; he could have saved me a run-in with officers for unlawful trespassing, and I'm not looking like a sweet angel myself.

I settle onto the couch, the lumpy cushions and a thin blanket offering more comfort than the stiff bench I had imagined myself on. My tired muscles rest from a burning fatigue, and my eyes close. I doze off to the lulling sound of rain hitting the windows, but then I hear it—a dragged-out, primal wailing from the next room. My heart races. An erratic, mournful noise. It makes my skin crawl. It is the universal sound of pain—deep-rooted, grief-stricken pain. I sit up, and it stops as abruptly as it began.

Unable to shake my unease, I take a deep breath. I wonder if I’m imagining things. My eyes scan the room, but I can’t see much in the thick darkness. I sniff the glass of water John gave me and don’t detect any strange odour. I take a cautious sip, then a slightly larger gulp to quench my dry mouth. It tastes uncomfortably stale and metallic.

As I put the glass away revolted, the door to John's room creaks open at a slow pace. I hold my breath, lying quiet. Footsteps slam the old floor. His shadowy figure darts straight to the bathroom with an odd, jerky gait. The bathroom door shuts behind him, and at the sound of someone flicking a switch, a yellow light spills from under the door.

I need to leave. As I stand up, trying to make as little noise as possible, heading for the door, something catches my eye.

I glance into John's room. Through the darkness, I see animal heads mounted on the walls in front of a fur-coated bed with a thick rope and duct tape lying exposed. The glassy eyes of the mounted animals stare back vacantly. My stomach churns.

I hastily put on my Crocs and jacket, barely able to keep my composure. Just as I slip my right arm into the jacket, John emerges from the bathroom, holding a long hammer and wearing latex gloves. His face is a mask of indifference.

“You stay right there,” he says in a chilling monotone. “I won’t kill you.”

I’m paralyzed, caught between the grotesque room and my escape. My mind races, my feet are frozen, but I have to get to the door, right? John adds, “I have more faces. You know, I'll show you my collection of human heads.”

Fear propels me into action. I sprint towards the door, but John storms at me. The hammer slams against the back of my head with a dull thud. The thick jacket helps absorb the blow, but I still feel a sharp sting of pain.

I fumble with the lock, struggling to open it with my left hand. My right hand lacks the fine motor skills to do it but has enough strength to pull the handle. John’s hammer swings dangerously close, hitting the door and grazing my neck. Another one strikes my temple, ripping it open. I feel warm blood streaming down my face. He grabs my jacket with brute force, pulling me in tight. In a desperate burst of strength, I manage to force the door open just enough to slip through. I shove past him, pushing him back as I squeeze through the narrow gap and burst into the hallway.

“Help! He’s killing me!” I scream, my voice vibrating through the empty halls. My feet pound the cold floor as I run. “He's trying to kill me!” I see no one comes to my aid.

On the street, headlights gleam in the distance, and I make a beeline for them. My feet pound the asphalt, and my pulse races so loudly I can’t hear the footsteps behind me, or when they stop following. A car slows, and I sense that John is no longer there. He is gone. I try to catch my breath, on the verge of hysterical tears, and explain what I’ve just been through. The driver helps me call the police.

When the officers arrive, they force me to check the apartment with them. Sweat drips from my forehead, and I feel alarmingly warm inside. I swallow hard against the rising bile, the taste in my mouth is sour and musty. His foul scent is everywhere. The apartment is pristine. John is calm, his poker face unchanging. The police find the animal heads but no human remains as he mentioned. They discover small traces of drugs in my system; I haven't taken any drugs, but they don’t believe me. I’m just a homeless guy.

John claims he tried to help me but that I went into a drug-induced, schizophrenic frenzy, injuring myself and fleeing. The officers side with him, dismissing my story as the ravings of a drugged, ill mind. He gets away just like that, and I don't know what to do, but I want to scream and howl and cry for someone to save me.

After my wounds are treated at the hospital, the driver takes me to the other side of town, and my fears deepen. Every shadow, every stranger feels like a lurking monster, preying with their forceful strength and killer instinct about to jump at me. The city feels colder, more isolated, and my fear of John—Mr. Poker Face—will haunt me for as long as these streets carry my echoing footsteps. I don’t know if he will hunt for me now, but I can’t shake the feeling that my safety lies in the hands of no one.
