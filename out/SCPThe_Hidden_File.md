Day 1 – The File

The data analysis team of Zone-19 received an unusual message from Zone-***. It was a file codenamed SCP, with no attached documents or explanations. The file was only 4 KB, but every attempt to open it caused malfunctions in the systems. Dr. Rivas, the head of technology, took it upon himself to investigate, ignoring the initial concerns.

After a few hours, the file finally opened. It contained no text, images, or data—only a black screen. Rivas raised his eyebrows and tried to close it. However, the screen remained open, even when he pulled the power cable. Then, the lights in the lab flickered, and a faint, almost imperceptible whisper was heard from the computer's speakers.

The staff believed it was just a software error. Only Rivas appeared genuinely disturbed. He claimed to have seen something moving on the screen, like a shadow that shouldn't have been there. The security staff laughed, attributing the incident to fatigue. Three hours later, Dr. Rivas disappeared from the lab without a trace. The cameras showed him staring at the screen and then... nothing. As if he had been erased from reality.

Day 3 – The Deletions

The security team started an investigation into Rivas's disappearance, but there was no sign that he had ever existed. The Foundation’s databases contained no record of his name, there was no entry in the logs, not even in photos of the staff. Those who had worked with him had completely forgotten about him, except for the two researchers who had seen him last.

Dr. Langley, the file management supervisor, opened SCP-***,again. This time, the black screen began to fill with names—thousands of names, Foundation personnel, both active and deceased. At the end of the list, Rivas’s name appeared, and directly below it, Langley’s name. The system crashed immediately after.

One hour later, Langley disappeared exactly like Rivas. The researchers who knew him began to feel an inexplicable confusion. Within hours, no one remembered who he was. His name had been erased from their memories, leaving only a strange, unexplained void.

Day 7 – The Whispers

Those who had come into contact with SCP-*** reported strange auditory hallucinations. They heard faint whispers coming from the corners of rooms, from computer screens, even from empty files in the databases. Some claimed the whispers tried to say their names.

Dr. Hamilton was the first to break. He started mumbling incoherent phrases and carving symbols on the walls of his lab. He said he had seen "something" inside the file—something that had no form but existed, hidden in the lines of code. Just before he committed suicide, he left a note:

"It’s not a file. It’s an entrance. And something is coming out."

Day 12 – The Breach

SCP-682 broke out of containment. However, this time, it did not attack anyone. Running through the hallways, it began to scream—not out of rage, but from pure fear. The security cameras recorded it talking to itself, something it had never done before. The only sounds coming from its mouth were:

"It can’t die. We can’t stop it. Run."

And then it stopped abruptly. It looked at a terminal screen, where SCP-***was open. For the first time in the Foundation’s history, SCP-682 cried. Then, its skin began to decompose into shadows, and it vanished into the terminal.

We never saw it again.

Day 21 – The Darkness

The lights went out. The generators failed. The electronic doors opened by themselves. SCP-***,had spread throughout the network. It was no longer a file. It was an entity existing within the information.

All those who had seen the file had already vanished. There were no records left of the staff, the SCPs, or even the Foundation itself. As if it had never existed. The last survivors wrote their final notes on paper, fearing that the electronic devices were now useless.

I am the last one. I don’t know if anyone will remember me once I finish this report. If anyone finds it, do not open the file. Do not read the data.

If you see my name on the list… then it is already too late.
