I want to share this with you ..
I will start with something i cant ever forget. 
Something that burned into my mind, cost a lot of friendships 
and most likely took a soul.

As i somehow dont know how to save the text, i will make several parts.

[PART 1]

Just a little bit of info up front.
I am not in contact with said friend anymore, and others of our friends group also broke apart after this.
Somehow it  was never the same after what happened on that night..

It all started as a party night out,
Me my best friend Nikola and another guy named Ellis where hanging around with some other friends..

We live in a little city in switzerland 
a country known for its alps and chocolate, 
bordering france.

As we often did on the weekends,
We drank and had a few smokes of the green, Sitting by our usual spot on a couple of benches near a school next to a few housing units.

A dark quiet place where you could hang out without fear of the cops fucking around with you.

As it turns out one of my friends couldn't handle the booze and started throwing up a bit so we had to say our farewells to him for the night
and as it somehow always magically happens, when the first one leaves, we all start to break up and wander home one by one into the night.
Not that anybody liked to walk home from there at that time of night.
Who does? 

Everybody knows that eerie feeling you get, walking home alone after abandoning all the action and laughing
and beeing confronted by the damp, lonely and somehow threatening silence of the alleys or streets.

If you're lucky enough to live close to each other, you had company walking home.. if you weren't , well.. 

As we slowly began to break up the gang, Nikola, Ellis and me (all living in about the same proximity) 
started to walk home together, laughing and talking 
on our way through the somehow damp looking streetlights.

I remember this evening beeing kind of..
You know when it feels like your packed in cotton? 
Lightheaded, but in a dreadfull manner yes..
Like you can't wait to get home but you think, before you make it something will jump out behind one of the last corners..

Our way home was not even that creepy
there was like two ways home.
One over the streets 
and one going down back alleys and housing units.
Not that bad actually..
As we neared Nikola's appartment block
he was like: "Hey guys i got some dope left, wanna find a dry place and smoke one last J"?

I was thinking it was actually a good idea,
even though i was tired and it was raining pretty hard by then.
It was also cold as shit.
November in Switzerland is no joke.

in this area there was not much to get under
and get away from the cold and so we decided to walk into the industrial zone.
Nikola knew a spot.


The industrial zone was like a few big 
houses made of concrete some kind of logistic centers for trucks and other big company stuff.
Not much to it 
although
there was one abandonend gas station someplace back there
but by that hour (23.15) it was closed already and nobody and nothing was to be seen back there.


As we walked down the road towards what we called the "waro" (an old shopping center that was abandonend in the mid 1970s)
We where already getting into the mode of laughing, because Ellis was so fat, he always used to say 
"Ican't walk that far" 
"come on guys lets turn around" 
and shit like that 

but..

Who knows maybe that night... it was intuition?

Finally, wet from the rain and cold to the bones 
we made it there
creepy as i think back to it..

all alone, next to dark logistic centers and abandonend traintracks leading to nowhere. 

If i think of it,  not even daytimes you saw many people back there..
Come to think, i never saw anybody back there myself for a long long time, as everything is pretty run down.
It must be that there's just nothing interesting down there to go to.

As we stand in front of it, we knew we couldn't enter normally, because the windows where shut with wood
and nailed to the walls.
As Nikola wasn't there the first time he showed us how to get in.

The way in was easy for a 16 year old :

Climb the fence 
put your jackets over the barb wire (old and somehow not very sharp no more)
jump over
After this we went to the door.

A big door they have to like roll up, so you can bring in goods from the back of a van or truck. To open it u need to lift the under part up together, one to the right one to the left.
So one person got to slide under the door and then roll it up a bit  manually from the inside and keep it in his grip until we are all in.

Nikola slid under, rolled it up and we went inside, happy to get out of the rain.

Upstairs was more like empty and there was nothing to sit on, also there was cold wind coming through board cracks in the windows
We had to use our flashlights that we had on our cell phones to walk around inside because the light was practically non existent

As it was really cold upstairs we decided to go down into the office rooms.

This is two stair flights down.

Think of this place as empty 
but not really empty. 
There was some old tables and chairs.
Some papers and flyers 
and also some old posters on the ground.

The floor down here was also somehow wet even though i have no idea where the water came from.. most  rooms to the left where even flooded.
So we had to go to the right, into a large room where they used to have breaks i suppose.

There where 2 chairs and one wooden crate on the ground.
I sat on the crate and started to build a joint.

Nikola in front of me in a chair.
Ellis to the right.

Behind Nikola the only entrance to the room.
