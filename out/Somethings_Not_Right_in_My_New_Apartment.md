I recently moved into a new apartment in a old building downtown. It’s one of those places with character—high ceilings, hardwood floors, and a slightly musty smell that hints at decades of history. I loved it at first. But now, I’m not so sure.

It started with small things. I’d come home to find my keys in a different spot than where I left them. I thought I was just being forgetful. Then, the bathroom light would be on when I knew I’d turned it off. I blamed it on faulty wiring or my own absent-mindedness.

About a week after moving in, I woke up around 3 AM to a faint noise. At first, I thought it was the neighbors. It sounded like someone whispering, but I couldn’t make out the words. I tried to go back to sleep, convincing myself it was just the old building creaking or voices carrying through the thin walls.

A few nights later, I woke up again at 3 AM. This time, it wasn’t whispering. It was the sound of footsteps, slow and deliberate, moving down the hallway outside my bedroom. My heart pounded in my chest as I lay there, frozen. The footsteps stopped right outside my door, and I could feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

I finally got the courage to get up and check. I opened the door slowly, expecting to see nothing. But the hallway was empty. I checked the locks on the front door and all the windows. Everything was secure. I told myself it must have been a dream or my imagination playing tricks on me.

The next day, I mentioned it to my landlord, an older woman who had owned the building for years. She gave me a strange look but didn’t say much. Later, one of my neighbors, a middle-aged guy named Tom, caught up with me in the hallway. “Hey, did you hear about the guy who used to live in your apartment?” he asked casually.

I shook my head, feeling a slight chill. “No, what happened?”

Tom glanced around before lowering his voice. “Apparently, he just disappeared one day. Left all his stuff behind. The landlord doesn’t like to talk about it, but people say he was a bit...off. Always talking about seeing things at night.”

I laughed it off, but inside, I felt uneasy. That night, I tried to focus on work, but the words on my laptop screen seemed to blur together. I kept glancing over my shoulder, feeling like I was being watched.

Around midnight, I decided to go to bed. As I was brushing my teeth, I heard it again—the whispering. This time, it was clearer. It was coming from the living room. My heart raced as I crept towards the sound. The living room was dark, but I could see a faint outline of a figure standing by the window.

“Hello?” I called out, my voice shaking. The figure didn’t move. I reached for the light switch, but when the room lit up, it was empty. I stood there, my mind racing, trying to make sense of what I’d seen. Had I imagined it?

The next few days were a blur. I kept hearing the whispers at night and seeing fleeting shadows out of the corner of my eye. I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t focus. I felt like I was losing my mind.

Finally, I decided to do some research on the building. I went to the local library and found old newspaper articles about a man named David who had lived in my apartment. He was reported missing about ten years ago. The articles mentioned that he had been acting strangely in the months before his disappearance, talking about seeing ghosts and hearing voices.

I didn’t know what to do. Part of me wanted to move out immediately, but another part of me wanted to understand what was happening. I reached out to a local historian who specialized in the paranormal. He agreed to come over and investigate.

When he arrived, he walked through the apartment, taking notes and asking questions. He seemed particularly interested in the hallway outside my bedroom. After a few hours, he sat down with me and explained that the building had a history of strange occurrences. Several tenants had reported similar experiences over the years, but nothing conclusive had ever been found.

He suggested I try to communicate with whatever was causing the disturbances. He gave me a list of questions to ask and a recorder to capture any responses. That night, I sat in my living room, feeling ridiculous but desperate. I asked the questions he had given me, feeling silly talking to an empty room. But when I played back the recording, I heard something that sent chills down my spine.

A faint voice, barely audible, whispered my name.

I moved out the next day. I couldn’t stay there any longer. I don’t know what was in that apartment, but I knew I couldn’t live with it. I found a new place across town, a modern building with no history. But sometimes, late at night, I still hear that whisper in my dreams, reminding me of the things that can’t be explained
