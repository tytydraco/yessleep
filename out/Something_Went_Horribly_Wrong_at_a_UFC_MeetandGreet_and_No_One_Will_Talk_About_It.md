I’d been counting down the days for nearly a month, ever since I saw the announcement that Tom Aspinall—fresh off securing the interim UFC heavyweight title—was hosting a meet-and-greet. Being an avid UFC fan, I didn’t hesitate to snag a premium VIP ticket as soon as they went on sale. All I could think about was the chance to shake Tom’s hand, hear about his journey, and walk away with a signed glove, a real piece of UFC history.

The anticipation built with each passing day. I remember telling my friends that this was going to be the highlight of my year—finally meeting the man whose fights I’d watched so obsessively. Everyone who knew me realized how big of a deal this was; Tom was a local hero, a symbol of grit and determination. Booking that VIP package felt like the perfect way to celebrate his success and feed my own excitement for the sport.

The day of the event arrived with a strange mix of nerves and joy. I set off early, determined not to miss a second of the action at the Delta Hotels Worsley Park Country Club. I kept checking my phone to ensure I still had my ticket details saved. Despite the thrill coursing through my veins, I had no idea that by nightfall, my expectations would be shattered in ways I never thought possible.

I arrived at the Delta Hotels Worsley Park Country Club just before sundown. The queue for the VIP meet-and-greet with Tom Aspinall snaked around the lobby and spilled into one of the side hallways, the buzz of eager voices filling the air. People were clutching UFC posters, gloves, tickets—anything they wanted Tom to sign. Security staff in black uniforms stood at key points, their expressions controlled but slightly harassed, probably from dealing with so many fans.

I had a premium VIP ticket which included a one-on-one with Tom, a photo op, and a signed glove. Outside the main function room, the line crept forward every few minutes. Most of us made small talk—excited, a little antsy—but overall good-natured. We were there to meet the man who’d clawed his way to the interim UFC heavyweight title. I’d followed his journey on TV, but I never expected the night to twist into something that would still haunt me whenever I’m alone at night.

Finally, I got my turn with Tom. He was all smiles in that confident but humble way that’s so rare in professional fighters. We chatted briefly about his training camp and how it felt to be the interim champion. I told him how I’d watched all his fights, from the smaller shows right through to the UFC, and he laughed, thanking me for sticking with him from day one. We posed for a photo, and he signed a professional UFC fight glove for me—his penmanship surprisingly neat despite the size of his hands.

“Enjoy the event,” he said with a grin as he handed me the signed glove.

But as I turned to leave, I froze. Behind him, reflected faintly in the glossy surface of the backdrop banner, was a figure.

It was hard to describe—almost like a silhouette, but its outline seemed… wrong. The edges were too sharp, yet somehow indistinct, like a shadow cast by a broken mirror. I blinked, and it was gone.

“Everything alright?” Tom asked, his brow furrowed.

“Yeah,” I muttered quickly, forcing a smile. “Thanks again.”

I walked away, clutching the glove tighter than necessary. At that point, I had no fucking clue what awaited us later.

The talk itself was set to take place in one of the conference suites inside the Country Club—a large modern luxury hall with rows of chairs facing a small stage at the front. After the meet-and-greet, I found my seat, and the atmosphere was electric. The room was arranged with chairs facing the stage setup. From a state of the art crystal clear audio/sound system and speakers set up by these renowned DJ's, faint music played while people settled in. A spotlight pointed at two armchairs on stage, presumably for Tom and the host, Adam Catterall. The vibe was fantastic—everyone was there to cheer for the champion and get an inside look into his rise through the UFC ranks.

Right before the talk started, there was a sudden flicker in the overhead lights. It lasted less than a second, but it made the entire hall gasp softly. I remember some older guy behind me cursing under his breath—“Shit, they better not blow a fuse.” The lights steadied, Adam walked onto the stage, introduced himself, introduced Tom, and the conversation kicked off.

Everything was smooth at first: Tom speaking about his training regimen, those gritty fights that brought him to the limelight, and some behind-the-scenes stories about the UFC. Occasionally, though, those lights flickered again. Maybe once every ten minutes. Each time, the tension in the audience thickened incrementally. People started whispering, shifting in their seats. One woman near the front kept glancing nervously at the entrance. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, but there was a weird vibe in the air—like some undercurrent that didn’t belong in a talk about sports.

Midway through Tom’s detailed account of his most vicious fight, the temperature in the hall plummeted. A chill that wasn’t attributable to any malfunction of the air conditioning crept over us, and an oppressive darkness seemed to seep into the corners of the room. I felt a cold sweat break out on my skin—an instinctive, gut-level dread that told me we were in for something far more disturbing than just a technical glitch. I remember thinking, “Holy fuck, what the hell is going on?”

The subtle disturbances evolved rapidly into something unexplainably sinister. A low, almost inaudible hum began to resonate through the speakers, overlaying Tom’s powerful narrative with a dissonant background note. Then, without warning, the projector screen behind Tom—a benign feature meant to showcase his training footage—displayed a series of jarring, grainy images. They weren’t part of the planned presentation. Instead, the screen flashed a montage of stark, horrifying scenes: an image of a bloodstain that pulsed as if it were alive, another of a terrified face frozen in silent scream, and yet another of a contorted hand reaching out desperately against an unseen force.

I swear on my life, those images weren’t a technical error or some obscure art project. They felt disturbingly real, as if they were echoes of violent memories embedded in the very walls of the club. Murmurs of confusion and terror rippled through the crowd. Adam’s voice, once steady, wavered as he muttered, “Fuck, something’s not right,” barely audible over the growing chaos.

As the talk continued, the supernatural interruptions intensified. The microphone, as if possessed by a malevolent force, began to pick up muffled voices. At first, they were indistinct whispers, but soon they became a cacophony of anguished cries and angry curses. I distinctly heard phrases like “Get the fuck out” and “This isn’t your place,” delivered in a distorted rasp that sent shivers down my spine. The sound wasn’t coming from any identifiable source—it was as though the very fabric of the room was speaking in voices of despair.

“What the actual fuck is going on?” someone whispered, and I wasn’t alone in feeling that raw, visceral panic. A heavy, almost palpable sense of foreboding pervaded the air, and even the signed glove, a symbol of triumph and achievement, began to feel cursed—like a relic charged with some malignant energy.

Then, around thirty minutes into the talk, Adam asked Tom a question about mental health and the pressures of being in the public eye. Tom paused, staring into the middle distance. For a second, I thought he was just gathering his thoughts. But something in his expression flickered—mirroring those damn lights. Slowly, he cleared his throat and pressed his lips together as though he were struggling not to say something awful. The entire hall went dead quiet.

One of the overhead speakers emitted a high-pitched screech—like feedback—but it didn’t stop. It kept going, a whine that drilled into your skull. People covered their ears. Someone stood up and yelled for the technicians to cut it off. They tried. The sound only got louder, until it suddenly ended in one abrupt snap, plunging us into stillness. Tom swallowed and continued as though nothing had happened, but his voice sounded off, strained. If you looked closely, you could see beads of sweat on his forehead, and the muscles in his jaw quivering.

I remember thinking this was fucking creepy. Sure, equipment can fail, but the atmosphere had changed so drastically. The flickering lights. The unrelenting screech. The tension so thick it felt like the entire room was breathing in shallow gasps. Something beyond normal technical difficulties was happening, and everyone sensed it.

Adam, ever the professional, tried to steer the conversation back on track. He asked Tom about his first knockout victory. Tom started recounting the fight, but his words were slow, halting. His eyes weren’t fixed on Adam or the audience; they were darting around, like he was seeing things in the corners of the room. And that’s when I heard it—like a faint dragging sound from behind the stage. A soft scratch, scratch, scratch…like nails being raked along the carpet. Several people in the front row turned, too, scanning the edges of the stage. Adam seemed oblivious, but Tom definitely heard it. He paused mid-sentence, breath catching in his throat. For a moment, I thought I could see a tremor in his fingers as he gripped the microphone.

Then came the moment that will haunt my dreams for years. As Adam’s voice wavered in a recounting of a particularly traumatic bout, the lights died completely. In that absolute darkness, the hum morphed into something akin to a growl. A collective gasp erupted as a single, harsh beam of emergency light illuminated the stage. There, amidst the now-silent audience, was a figure standing in the center—a dark silhouette that resembled a man, but whose presence was unnervingly out of place. It wasn’t Tom, and it wasn’t anyone we recognized. The figure stood unmoving for an eternity before vanishing without a sound, leaving behind only the echo of its unsettling presence.

That alone would have been disturbing enough, but a series of chilling events followed:

1. A loud bang echoed through the hall, though no one could find the source.
2. Several guests felt a sudden drop in temperature around them.
3. One of the overhead lights started swinging violently, even though no breeze or draft was present.

Then, the overhead lights cut out. Completely. We were plunged into darkness, with only the faint glow of emergency exit signs near the doors. People muttered and cursed. Someone’s phone flashlight went on, shining an eerie beam around. We heard a dull thud on stage—Adam’s microphone hitting the floor. Tom mumbled something we couldn’t make out. And then came the most horrifying scream I’ve ever heard. It sounded like a man—Adam, maybe—but it was layered with this wailing undertone, like someone else was screaming in sync with him.

Distorted screams echoed in the hall. Some people shrieked that they could see shadowy figures stalking between the rows of seats. Others fell to the ground as if pulled by invisible hands. Security guards tried to maintain order, but fear coursed through every corner of that building.

Just then, the entire hall was plunged into darkness again. A cacophony of scraping noises reverberated—the screech of chairs dragging across the floor on their own. The main screen lit up again from the projector's beam, strobe-like flashes of that red light blinked in and out, illuminating horrifying snapshots:

A man pinned to a wall, clawing at something on his face.

Another person crawling under the seats, moaning in terror, eyes rolled back in their skull.

Lights sputtered back to life. Adam was on his knees, retching violently, eyes wide and glassy, trying to form words but only managing strangled gasps. Tom stood over him, face pale as a sheet, hands clutching the sides of his own head. The audience just stared in shock, some people half-rising from their seats, unsure whether to help or flee.

Then we heard the first scream.

It came from somewhere behind me, near the middle rows. I turned around instantly, adrenaline spiking through my veins. A man in his forties—broad-shouldered, wearing a UFC T-shirt—was hunched over, clutching his arm. At first, it looked like he might’ve just cut himself on a broken piece of glass from that light. But then he jerked upright, trembling, and there were these dark streaks staining his sleeve. The strangest part was that his eyes were locked on something in the corner of the ceiling, near the back exit. I followed his gaze, and my stomach lurched.

One of the staff rushed onto the stage, but the moment he touched Adam’s shoulder, the staffer recoiled like he’d been burned. He stumbled back, face twisted in terror. I can’t forget how, in that instant, Adam looked up at us. His eyes were vacant, his mouth trembling. Then, in a voice that didn’t sound like his own, he started mumbling about “burying them alive” and “hearing them scratching inside the walls.” Absolute gibberish that made the hairs on my neck stand up.

A woman near the back stood up abruptly, her face pale. “I need to get out of here,” she said, her voice shaky. But as she turned toward the exit, her body stiffened. She froze mid-step, her head snapping back unnaturally as if pulled by an unseen force.

Her scream was unlike anything I’d ever heard—high-pitched, raw, and primal. It wasn’t just fear; it was agony. She collapsed to the floor, convulsing violently. Security rushed to her side, but before they could reach her, something seemed to yank her across the carpet, leaving a trail of deep red scratches in the fibers. The sight was stomach-turning, and I couldn’t tell if it was blood or just the horrifying friction burns from being dragged. The entire crowd recoiled in terror.

That’s when it happened.

A man near the front row stood abruptly, his chair clattering to the floor. He started convulsing, his limbs jerking violently. People rushed to help, but as they touched him, they recoiled in horror. His skin was ice-cold, his veins bulging dark and prominent, almost black against his pale flesh. He let out a guttural scream, his eyes rolling back into his head.

At this point, people at the back of the hall decided they’d had enough. They hurried for the doors, but the staff blocked them, telling everyone to remain calm, that they needed to wait for instructions. That’s when an argument broke out—people screaming at security, fists raised, cursing. Chairs got knocked over. Someone shoved a guard. Chaos was unraveling.

A man near the exit yelled, “The door’s locked! It won’t fucking open!”

And then we noticed someone else was missing—another staff member, who had been standing near the doors a minute ago. Gone. No one saw him leave. The overhead lights flickered again, and in those brief intervals of darkness, several audience members swore they saw silhouettes drifting along the walls, close to the corners of the room. I thought it might be a trick of my eyes, but it happened more than once. My heart was hammering so loud I could hear my own pulse in my eardrums.

A woman near one of the side aisles stood, her movements jerky, unnatural, as if her joints bent in directions they shouldn’t. Her face was obscured by her hair, but her mouth was visible, moving soundlessly as if she were screaming.

Then she stopped. She turned her head slowly toward the stage, as though she’d noticed something that the rest of us were still too stunned to see. Her hand raised shakily, pointing at nothing. A second later, her entire body went limp, collapsing in a heap. Those nearest to her screamed and stepped back, petrified at the sheer unnaturalness of it all.

More scuffling sounds echoed around us, followed by a stifled yell from one corner. People turned their phone flashlights that way. We spotted a man collapsed on the ground, arms rigid at his sides, eyes rolled back. Another guest knelt beside him, frantically checking for a pulse. The man convulsed and let out a guttural moan that still makes my stomach churn when I think about it.

I turned to the stage, and my blood ran cold.

Tom and Adam were frozen in place, their expressions blank. Their mouths hung open, eyes wide and unblinking, as if they were puppets whose strings had been cut.

Despite no official announcements coming through, we knew we had to evacuate. The security staff eventually relented, opening the double doors to let us out. Everyone poured into the lobby, and it was total fucking mayhem—people crying, shaking, babbling about seeing shadows moving in the hotel corridors. A few folks demanded refunds, yelling their heads off at the manager behind the front desk, but it was like the entire hotel staff was in a daze.

I was ready to bolt. But for some reason—maybe fear, maybe curiosity—I felt compelled to see if Tom and Adam were safe. I looped back, dodging hotel staff, heading toward the rear exit that led to the parking lot. And that’s when I spotted a blood smear on the tiled floor. Bright red, slick, a trail leading toward a service hallway. My stomach lurched. Against every instinct, I followed it. The hallway smelled of bleach and stale air, like the behind-the-scenes area of a big hotel. The trail led around a corner and ended at a maintenance closet. The door was ajar, and the overhead light flickered, illuminating random patches of the corridor.

The staff member who’d disappeared was inside, or at least what was left of him. He had collapsed face-up, eyes wide open, foam trickling from the side of his mouth, as if in the throes of a violent seizure. I’ve never seen a corpse before, but I knew in that moment he was gone—whatever the hell had happened had broken him from the inside. There was no blood around him except that smear, which didn’t even seem to originate from a visible wound. Yet the expression on his face was horrific, like he’d seen the worst nightmares brought to life. My entire body froze.

Suddenly, from deeper in the closet, there was a wet shuffle. My breath caught in my throat. I can’t fully put the sound into words—like dragging something heavy through a puddle. I backed away, practically tripping over my own feet. My phone’s flashlight played erratically on the walls. In the beam, I saw some shallow gouges on the plaster, as if someone had scraped at it with frantic fingers. At that moment, I couldn’t take it anymore. I turned and ran, feet pounding on the cold floor, swearing under my breath, half-certain some phantom presence was right behind me.

When I emerged into the main corridor, the hotel staff had ushered people outside. I saw Adam being carried out on a stretcher by paramedics, his face gaunt and sweat-soaked, eyes still bulging with that wide stare. Tom was nowhere in sight. The flickering lights in the hallway, the blood trail, the man in the closet—I realized I was in no condition to help or make sense of any of it. My fight-or-flight instinct was in overdrive, screaming that I had to leave.

Outside, emergency vehicles and blue lights painted the parking lot in a surreal glow. Some people sat on the curb, sobbing. Others stood in clusters, talking in hushed, frantic voices about what they’d experienced—one person claimed the entire building was haunted, another claimed they felt a freezing hand brush against their shoulder in the dark. A shaken security guard muttered about hearing strangled moans in the staff corridors, like “someone locked in a damn coffin.” It was an absolute fucking nightmare, the kind of incident that you don’t see on the news because no one knows how to explain it.

I eventually got to the end of the car park, panting, sweating, and booked an Uber. Those 5 - 6 minutes seemed to take forever, the anxiety and dread just unbearable. The signed glove from Tom remained on the passenger seat the entire way, and for some reason, even the sight of it felt foreboding, as if it were tainted. My hands were shaking so badly, I almost forgot the signed glove on the seat when I exited the car.

By the time I got home, I locked myself in my apartment and just sat in darkness, my mind replaying that screech, that horrifying scream, and the blank, contorted face of the staff member in the closet. Days later, rumors and conspiracies flew around about what really happened that night: some folks whispered about demonic possession, others claimed it was some bizarre cult ritual gone awry, and many said the hotel owners did everything they could to silence witnesses or pay them off. The management at Worsley Park never released an official statement, never offered any explanation—just vague apologies to those who tried to get a refund. It seemed like they wanted to bury the entire incident under a mountain of corporate hush.

Some tabloids speculated about mental breakdowns, others about conspiracies. One rumor even suggested that the entire hotel staff had to undergo psychological evaluation after a wave of breakdowns and severe paranoia in the following nights. However it went down, the truth remains locked up in that building, unspoken and left to fester in the dark.

No official statement was ever made about the night at Delta Hotels Worsley Park Country Club. The usual whispers continued, that the land was cursed or built on something old, something vile. Others speculated that dark energy had latched onto Tom’s gloves, or perhaps something had followed him from one of his intense UFC battles.

I have no idea how to explain it. A mass hallucination? Some twisted prank that got out of hand? But there’s no rational reasons that I can think of.

Now, whenever I think of that damned meet-and-greet, my stomach knots. The memory is so vivid—the flickering lights, Adam’s tortured screams, the blood trail, and the dreadful knowledge that something unexplainable gripped that place and refused to let go. It’s the worst fucking night I’ve ever experienced. And I haven’t been to any events since. Just the thought of sitting in a dimly lit function room makes me break into a cold sweat.

Whatever happened at that hotel still haunts me. The nightmares are the worst—waking up at 3 AM, convinced I hear that dragging sound outside my bedroom door. I can’t walk down a dark hallway without picturing those gouges in the plaster. And I swear, sometimes, out of the corner of my eye, I see shapes flitting along the walls—shapes that vanish the second I turn my head.

I don’t know if it was a shared delusion, some freak atmospheric phenomenon, or something else. All I know is I left a piece of myself in that place—a sense of safety I doubt I’ll ever fully get back.

If you ever find yourself at Worsley Park, do yourself a favor: *don’t stay after dark.*
