Look. 
This is going to be strange. And I know that. But I have to tell my story. I NEED to tell my story. So here it goes. Please save all judgement AFTER reading my post:

My wife, Marissa, and I were looking to move. That’s when we found this house. It was a godsend. It was way below our budget. So much that we didn’t hesitate. We just bought the damn thing. 

It was everything we were looking for: a beautifully built home with enough space for my daughter, Ellie, to play, and extra rooms in case there were any more new family on the way.
But the second we stepped into the house, I felt this strong, dark energy. The more I walked around in the house, the heavier it felt. But Marissa and Ellie loved it, so I just sucked it up, thinking maybe it was ‘pre-house jitters,’ if that's even a real thing. It didn’t take long for everyone else to start feeling what I had felt though.

It first started with Marissa… I woke up one night to some awful noise coming from the kitchen. It sounded rugged, like the blender was crushing ice. No kidding, that was my first thought—the fucking blender. I turned to my side to see if Marissa was awake, but she was gone. That made me nervous.

See, Marissa used to sleepwalk when she was younger. Occasionally, she would sleepwalk whenever she had a big meeting coming up or was just super nervous about something. I had to make sure she was okay, so I got out of bed and started to walk down the stairs to see what was going on. When I got down there, I had to hold in my scream. You’re not supposed to wake up a sleepwalker; I learned that the hard way. 

Anyway, when I stepped into the kitchen, Marissa was holding the biggest knife we had and was carving something onto the wall—that’s what the noise was.
I gently tried to grab the knife, but her grip was tight. It was too tight; there was blood on her hands just from how hard she held the knife. I tried with both hands, but she wouldn’t let go. 

I quickly grabbed a few dishrags from the drawer to see if I could grab the blade instead, but the second I reached for her, she turned the knife on me and started to stab me in the shoulder. I started screaming in pain, that’s when Marissa woke up. 

She was confused at first, but when she saw the bloody knife in her hands and the wound it made, she screamed louder than I did. I put the clean dishrags on the bleeding wound, we woke up Ellie, and rushed to the Emergency Room. Luckily, it wasn’t anything major. By the time we got to the ER, the bleeding had stopped. They cleaned it up, gave me ten stitches, and we got back home before the sun was up.

Marissa had put Ellie to bed again before joining me downstairs. I was sitting in the living room, having a stiff glass of bourbon. ‘Marissa, what the fuck happened?’ I asked. 
‘I don’t know,’ she said to me. ‘I was just dreaming, and all of a sudden, there I was, stabbing my husband.’
‘Well, what were you dreaming about?’
She shrugged and said, “I don’t know. I can’t remember anymore. It was the strangest thing, though. It was like I could see myself walking down the stairs, pulling out the knife, and just started carving into the wall. It was like I wasn’t in control anymore. Like something else was controlling me…” 

The conversation stopped there, so we went to bed, hoping to get a few more hours of sleep. Well, I ended up  sick anyway so I could get more sleep. Marissa and Ellie had left for the day; she wanted to let me sleep in but also wanted Ellie to avoid the kitchen and the mess that was left behind. Which meant it was my job to clean it up. 

When I returned to the kitchen, I was shocked to see the damage Marissa had left. It must’ve been 3ft wide, it looked like a symbol, a circle with lines with an outer ring. Like a peace sign the hippies would wear on their clothes, but turned upside down. And a circle, which I swear to God, made the entire thing look like a person. Whatever it was, it didn’t feel peaceful, and I sure as hell didn’t like looking at it, so I quickly covered it up. 

Once it was covered, I was ready to clean off any blood that might’ve spilled from the accident… but there wasn’t any blood—None—Not even the knife she stabbed me with. It confused me, but I just figured that Marissa cleaned it up last night, or maybe I did, but somehow forgot? I just shrugged it off—one less thing to clean.

A few weeks later, another weird thing happened, but this time it was Ellie. Marissa and I were in bed, and all of a sudden, Ellie started screaming bloody murder. We rushed out of our room and busted through Ellie’s door. And there she was, just sleeping in bed. I tell you, that kid could sleep through anything, but I thought for sure she would’ve woken up. 

Fear flowed into my bloodstream—she should’ve been awake. I feared that my child was dead, so I started to nudge her, maybe a little too aggressively, and started to shout her name. Marissa had to pull me away, and right on cue, Ellie’s little blue eyes peeked over at us. She was indeed alive.

Marissa and I returned to our room, and she was livid. ‘What the hell was that?’ she asked.

‘Did you not hear her screaming? But we just found her sleeping like a rock? What the hell was that?’ I remember saying to her.

‘What scream? I only bolted out the door because you did. I had no idea why, then you break her door open and just start shaking her like a madman,’ my wife said with conviction.

‘So, you didn’t hear her scream?’

‘No!’ she yelled. ‘I’m going back to sleep; we can talk about this in the morning.’

I was completely in shock that she didn’t hear Ellie scream. Fuck, I could still hear it echoing in my ears, even as I write this. I had never felt so scared, I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night. I just laid there, replaying the events over and over.

A lot of crazy shit happened in the last month. We all started to hear whispering, furniture was getting moved around, and we started to see things—bloody, graphic, horrible things. But the most fucked up thing that happened was when Ellie found our cat, Mr. Jingles, one morning. 

Poor thing was skinned alive, and was just hanging on the fence, his tails slid between the fence posts. It took us an hour to get him off, we ended just cutting the tail off. 

That was hard on Ellie, all of it was hard for her. The things we were experiencing, it was too much for a child. She became a different person, all the joy from her life was getting drained. It broke our hearts seeing her like this. We knew we had to move, sell the house, and get Ellie some help…

Okay, this next part.
Fuck.

What I’m about to tell you happened just two nights ago. 

We were asleep, and then Marissa and I woke up to Ellie screaming. This time, I looked at her, and we shared the same fearful look. We got out of bed as fast as we could and went to Ellie’s room. She was still screaming. 

I tried the doorknob, but it wouldn’t turn. It wasn’t like it was locked; it felt like someone, or something, was holding it from the other side.

‘Ellie, sweetie? Please let go of the door, we want to help,’ I said.
No response except her screaming.

Then Marissa tried, ‘Ellie, please, let go of the door!’

And then, we heard another voice. It… I don’t think I’ll ever forget it. It didn’t sound like a normal voice. It was deep, really deep. Gravelly, raspy, but also piercing, like the bass notes of an electro-theremin. I can't even think about it without getting nauseous. But it was perfectly clear. We both heard the voice bellow out, ‘NO!’

Marissa and I didn’t know what to think, we looked at each other terrified. I tried to bust through the door, but it wouldn’t budge. I tried and tried until my arm got sore. I finally looked at Marissa and asked her to help, and with both of us using all our strength, we finally broke in. I turned on the lights, and then…we saw the… Thing… I… can’t even describe it…

There, standing at the foot of Ellie’s bed, was this tall, black creature. It darker than darkness, and its body moved like ink flowing through water. The skin—if you could even call it that—was almost amphibious the way the light was reflecting off of it. The body was covered in these different sized lumps, which would bubble and pop like a pot of water boiling over. It had these long, blade like fingers. But the thing that keeps circulating in my nightmares was its face, or lack of one. 

This Thing, standing mighty with the build of a 10-foot linebacker, just stared at us with no eyes, no facial expression, no facial features! We were just staring back out into…nothing…
I stood, like a statue, completely still. I didn’t have a single clue what it was. I was just frozen in fear. Marissa screamed right in my ear, and I think that broke me out of my trance, but before I could do anything, I watched as the Thing raised its hand like a ‘shoo’ motion. Marissa and I went flying out of the room, down the stairs, breaking through the guard rails, and collapsing to the ground floor. 
Marissa landed on the dining table while I landed on the hardwood floors. One of the broken pieces of a rail had pierced my lower back and was still sticking out. I pulled it out, whimpering in pain. 

Next thing I remembered was looking back up to the second floor, and there it was, the black figure. It floated towards us, its body rippling with each stride. I watched it approach me, and with another flick of its wrist, it sent me flying into the living room. The power, the force it had, it pushed everything in front of it. I landed hard again, this time on my back, my legs went numb. I had to drag myself up so I could see the Thing again, and that's when I saw it looking at Marissa. 

She was unconscious on the table; she didn't even see it. I watched it grab her legs and dragged her closer. Then, that Thing grabbed her by the waist, then turned and faced me. It was like it wanted me to watch…

I told you that I didn't think it had a mouth, but I was wrong. It didn't have lips, but it sure as fuck had a mouth. That fucking thing stretched out a wide opening and revealed an impossibly long throat, it must’ve been a mile long. Its long, red, pointed tongue flopped out of its mouth to reveal the walls of its throat. Its throat was lined with these razor-like shark teeth that were circulating in rows, moving like the inside of a pencil sharpener. Then… it started to ‘eat’ her.


Marissa snapped out of her daze and screamed. She pleaded, cried, and tried to break free, but it was pointless. That Thing was grinding her up like a woodchipper, all of her flesh and bones just draining down that Thing’s throat. It shredded her legs and got to just about where her stomach was, then it just dropped her upper half right onto the dining table. Her insides started spilling out… She looked so limp… So lifeless… She was fucking dead… And then… it turned to me… and that fucking Thing grinned at me. 

It fucking… grinned at me. 

And Ellie? Well, I'm glad I wasn't conscious to see what it did to her. I must’ve blacked out because all I remembered was that fucking smile, and then it was morning. I remember waking up on the floor, still sore from the night before; it was a gentle reminder of the horrors I endured. 

As I got up, I saw that the house was destroyed. I looked at Marissa’s her upper half, all the way from the living rooms. She was still on top of our dining table, but there wasn't any blood, it had disappeared. When I got closer to her, I saw her eyes were missing… It took her fucking eyes!

I knew I had to check on Ellie, and as I looked up those stairs, I became terrified. With each step I took, I felt like I was going to throw up. I was so scared, not about that fucking Thing, but about Ellie… I didn’t want to know what happened to her, but at the same time, I needed  to know. 

When I got to her room, I screamed and started punching the walls. She was lying on top of her bed, dead. Her eyes were gone, just like Marissa’s. But unlike Marissa, Ellie’s chest was ripped open, her rib cage was sticking out of her skin, and I saw the innards of my child displayed in front of me. The only thing missing, was her little heart. I cried hard; it was all hitting me… My family was dead.

Okay. That’s it. That’s my story. 
I don’t expect you to believe me, because why would you? 
It doesn’t matter. 
I’m not a liar. 
I know what I went through. 

But if you believe me. 
Please know there is real evil in this world. 
It’s not for jokes, guys. 
I’m so scared. But it’s time. 

Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time I returned to my family…
