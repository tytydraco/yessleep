I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe it's to warn others, or maybe it's just to convince myself that what happened was real. My name is Dr. Alisa Kern, and I'm the sole survivor of what used to be Dante Station - a remote correctional facility orbiting the fiery star we nicknamed Dante. God, how I wish I could forget everything, but the memories are burned into my mind like the scars on my body.



It all started three months ago when a new prisoner arrived. We didn't know much about him - just that he was found drifting in a long-distance spacecraft, covered in blood that wasn't his own. The higher-ups were unusually tight-lipped about his background, which should have been our first warning.



I remember the day he arrived. As the station's lead researcher, it was my job to oversee his integration. When they pulled him out of cryo-sleep, I was struck by how ordinary he looked. Average height, unremarkable features, dull brown hair. The only thing that stood out was his eyes - a piercing, unnatural shade of violet that seemed to look right through you.



We called him John Doe, and for the first few weeks, everything seemed normal. He was quiet, kept to himself, didn't cause any trouble. But then the incidents started.



It was subtle at first. Inmates reported feeling uneasy around him, like they were being watched even when he wasn't there. Some complained of nightmares - vivid, terrifying dreams where they were trapped in burning hellscapes. We dismissed it as typical prison anxiety.



Then came the unexplained injuries. Bruises appearing on inmates and staff alike, with no recollection of how they got them. Electronic systems malfunctioning when John Doe was nearby. And the worst part? Security footage would always be conveniently corrupted during these events.



I tried to raise concerns with Karen, our chief of security, but she brushed me off. "We're here to study these criminals, Alisa," she said. "If strange things are happening, that's all the more reason to keep him here."



Things escalated about a month after John Doe's arrival. An inmate named Cesar, one of our most aggressive prisoners, attacked John in the common area. What happened next still haunts me.



I was watching through the observation window when Cesar lunged at John with a makeshift shiv. But before the blade could touch him, Cesar just... stopped. His eyes went wide, and he started screaming. Not in pain, but in absolute terror. He dropped to the ground, convulsing, foam bubbling from his mouth. And John? He just stood there, watching, with those eerie violet eyes.



When we reviewed the footage later, all we saw was static. Cesar survived, but he was never the same. He became a shell of his former self, spending his days huddled in a corner, muttering about "the void" and "eyes in the dark."



After that incident, I threw myself into researching John Doe. I broke protocol, accessing classified files, trying to find any information about his past. What I found chilled me to the bone.



There were reports of similar incidents on other stations, other planets. Mysterious deaths, unexplained phenomena, always centered around a man with violet eyes. The reports dated back decades, far longer than John Doe's apparent age. And every time, he was the only survivor.



I tried to warn the others, but they wouldn't listen. Karen accused me of paranoia, threatened to remove me from the project. Even Pany, my closest friend on the station, started avoiding me.



Then came the day everything went to hell.



It started with the alarms. Blaring sirens, flashing red lights. At first, we thought it was a system malfunction - not uncommon on a station as old as ours. But then we lost artificial gravity. I was floating in my lab when Karen's voice came over the intercom, panic evident even through the static.



"This is not a drill. Dante Station has left its orbit. All personnel report to emergency stations immediately."



I made my way to the control room, pushing through floating debris and panicked staff members. When I got there, the scene was chaos. Screens were flashing warning messages, and through the viewport, I could see the fiery surface of Dante growing larger by the second.



"What happened?" I shouted over the alarms.



Karen's face was ashen. "We don't know. The systems just went haywire. We're being pulled into Dante's gravity well."



That's when I noticed John Doe wasn't in his cell. "Where is he?" I demanded.



Karen's eyes widened in realization. "The prisoner... he's gone."



We found him in the engine room, standing calmly amidst the malfunctioning equipment. But he wasn't alone. Surrounding him were... I don't even know how to describe them. Shapes that hurt to look at, writhing masses of darkness that seemed to absorb the light around them.



And John Doe? He was smiling.



"What are you?" I managed to ask, my voice barely a whisper.



He turned those violet eyes on me, and I felt a chill run down my spine. "I am a traveler," he said, his voice eerily calm. "And you have all been most... educational."



What happened next is still a blur. The shapes lunged at us. I heard screams, saw flashes of light. I remember running, pushing through corridors that seemed to stretch and distort around me. The laws of physics seemed to break down - gravity shifting wildly, walls becoming floors, ceilings turning to liquid.



I made it to an escape pod, more by luck than skill. As I strapped myself in, I caught a final glimpse of the station through the viewscreen. It was... changing. Twisting into impossible geometries, parts of it seeming to fold in on themselves.



And there, standing at a viewport, was John Doe. He looked right at me, and I swear, even across the vacuum of space, I heard his voice in my head.



"Thank you for your hospitality, Dr. Kern. Until we meet again."



The escape pod launched, and I watched in horror as Dante Station, my home for the past five years, was torn apart. Not by the star's gravity, but by something far more terrifying. The station didn't burn up or explode - it simply ceased to exist, leaving behind a void that hurt to look at.



I drifted for days before a passing freighter picked up my distress signal. When I tried to tell them what happened, they attributed my story to trauma and oxygen deprivation. Maybe they're right. Maybe I am crazy.



But I know what I saw. I know what John Doe was - or wasn't. And I know he's still out there.



So let this be a warning. If you're out in the black, and you come across a man with violet eyes, run. Run as fast and as far as you can. Because he's not human, and he's not alone.



And God help us all if he finds another station to "study."
