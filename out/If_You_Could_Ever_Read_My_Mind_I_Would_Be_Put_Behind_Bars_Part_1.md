In A Hurry To Return, I Didn't Even See The Sun Setting, As I Was On My Way To Home, I Had A Constant Fear Of Witnessing Darkness Crawling Across The Street. The House Was Deep Inside The Woods, With No One Around. As I Got Near The House, I Could See Someone Walking Around The Bungalow. 

" Maybe, It's Mom," I Thought, And Started To Walk A Bit Faster, Only To Realise That It's Not Her. As I Got Closer, With The Dim Street Light Falling On, A Lady, With No Clothes, Was Menacingly Walking Around The House, Talking To Herself, Reading A Book.

The Torch In My Hands Started To Shake, I Could Feel My Tremors Going Worse, Until I Realised The Lady Walking Around Was My Sister.

I Gently Ran Behind The Wall, And Hid Myself. My Sister, Sarah, Was Turning Over The Pages Aggressively. 

In A Moment, Apart From The Chirping, I Hear Footsteps On the Meadows, Getting Closer And Closer. I took A Peak, And saw Sarah Coming Towards Me, Reading The Book, Her Bloody Shoulder Was Obscure.

I Silently Walk Back, Avoiding Chaos. Though I Hear The Footsteps, I Do Not Turn Around, Hoping For A Greener Pasture. 

The Darkness, The Silence, Conquered The Night. I Keep On Walking, But The Footsteps Do Not Stop. For A Moment, I Stop And Look Back To See Sarah, Just Reading The Book In The Dark. 

" What The...?," I Said To Myself And Started Walking Again, A Bit Faster. But This Time, The Footsteps Become Faster Too. I Pray To The Lord And Stop Again. The Foots Stop Too.

But This Time, I Feel A Little Agitated To Turn Back. But Having No Other Option, I Opted To Confront The Lady. I Turn Back And See Sarah Giving Me A Black Look, With Her Venom Emitting Eyes, A Torn Page Falling Out of Her Mouth, And A Sinister Smile. 

I Smirk And Dart, Praying To The Lord For The First Time In My Life.

I Had To Skip School, Two Days, Because Of That Encounter. I Was Just Returning Home From The Library When Sarah Chased Me To The Bus Stop Before Bailing After Seeing The People.

The Throne That Stuck In My Foot Was In No Mood To Heal. I Lost A Lot Of Blood. Mom Came And Picked Me Up At The Bus Stop, Where I Hid From Sarah.

When I Returned To School After The Absence, Everyone Left Me Abandoned. The Teachers, Students, Everyone Did Not Even Try To Acknowledge My Existence. When I Tried Asking About My Solidarity, One Of My Friends Replied Saying," We Know That Your Sister Is Possessed, Samuel."

" How Did You Even Know, I Told No One," I Scream In Anger. " Your Mom Told." A Guy Replied From The Front Row.

It All Happened 16 Years Ago, When I Noticed Minor Tremors Developing In One Of My Hands. It Was In The Month Of February, Before The Summer Vacation. My Sister Sarah, 21, Used To Stay At A Hostel In Mumbai. She Used To Pay Us A Visit Every 6 Months, To Our House In Delhi. But Because Of Some Travel Issues, She Couldn't Visit Us For 2 Years. She Was A Linguistic. She Could Speak More Than 7 Languages.

One Tuesday, There Was A Call To The House, And It Was Sarah. She Informed Us About Her Arrival In The Coming Month Of March. Everyone In The House Was Delighted To Hear From Sarah. Mom Hired Some Workers From The Agency, To Renovate Sarah's Room. 

We Used To Live In A Farmhouse, Backside An Abandoned Church, Where The Area Is Covered With So Many Trees For About Half A Mile With No Humans Around. 

Back In The Day, Street Lights Were Very Rare, And Our House Was In An Area Where, Even The Sunlight Could Not Reach Our Sight, Because Of The Dense Trees. No One Dared To Come Out In The Evenings, Fearing The Wildlife. We Had To Travel Half A Mile To Get Any Of The Household Work Done.

Sarah Used To Live Beside My Room, On The First Floor, And Mom And Dad Beneath The Floor. The Room I Lived In Had A Window, Covered With The Trees. There Was No Peace As, Sometimes, Late In The Night, I Used To Wake Up All Of A Sudden, Because Of The Noise Made By The Peacocks, Living In The Trees, Or Cause Of The Monkeys, Trying To Run A Ambush, Hoping To Get Some Food.

In Fear Of The Examinations, I Didn't Even See The Day Coming Of Sarah's Arrival. She Was There, All Of A Sudden, When I Got Home From School. 

With Great Joy, I Went Into The House, And All I Can See Was, The Faces Of My Mom And Dad Filled With Anger, Staring At Sarah, Who Was Sitting On The Couch, With A Numb Face, Just Looking Around With Dead Eyes.

"What Happened?," I Cried. " She Got A Tatoo On Her Shoulder. And It's Bleeding. I Asked Her Why, But There's No Response," Said My Mom, With Great Sorrow. And Then, The Same Night While I Was Returning Home, After Getting Some Work Done In The Library, Sarah Behaved Like A Weirdo By Chasing Me.

The News Broke Out To The School, That Sarah Was Not Acting Sane. Remembering The Times When I Used To Walk Past Her Room To Reach The Examination Hall, Was Beyond A Nightmare.

Dealing With The Academics Along With The Household Issues Was A Tough Battle. Forthwith The Examinations, An Incident Which Left Me Feared The Whole Vacation Was A Futile Attempt To Take A Piss. It Was In The Middle Of The Night, The Time When I Was Playing The Punisher On My PC. In The Middle Of The Play, I Got A Painful Urge To Pee. The Washroom Was Downstairs, Which I Never Intended To Use Anyway. 

Always Had A Habit Of Peeing On To The Trees, Right From The Terrace In The Nights, For Which I Once Nearly Got Beaten To Death By My Father. When I Got Out Of The Room, The Silence Was All Over The Place. Once I Reached The Terrace, I Turned To The Banyan Tree Towards My Left, And Went Near The Corner. I Close My Eyes, Unzip My Pants, And Enjoy The Cold Breeze While Letting The Waste Out.

After Getting Done, I Zip Up My Pants, And Proceed To Go Downstairs. While Doing So, I Heard Something Running On The Other Side Of The Terrace, Which Was Shielded By A Wall. Out Of Curiosity, I Take A Peek Onto The Other Side Unaware Of The Unknown.

There Was A Chair On The Other Side. An Obsolete One, Which Had Thorns Grown Out Of It, Threatened Anyone Who Dared To Sit On It With Punctures. Our Dog Which Dad Brought Home After Saving It While Serving The Nation, Was Gazing At The Chair Fiercely, As If There Was Someone On It, Whom I Couldn't See.

The Entire Time, The Dog Never Tilted His Head From The Chair, And To Make Things Even Worse, The Dog Started Waving Its Tail, Snarling, Running Away From The Chair, Acknowledging The Unknown. After Witnessing It, I Couldn't Dare To Turn The Lights Off The Whole Night.

The Following Day, I Heard Someone Banging On My Door. I Wake Up And See The Burning Sun Emitting Fire Outside The Window. It Was At Noon. I Opened The Door. " She's Starving." My Mom Said, Asking Me To Come Downstairs. I Went Down To See My Sister Lying On The Couch, With Some Food Lying Beside Her, Reading A Book, Penning Down Some Words Passionately. 

She's Only Eating In The Presence Of That Book In Her Hands. She's Not Even Looking At The Food, When I Tried To Snatch It Away," Said My Father In Great Anger. "What's Even In That Book," I Asked. "Who Knows?," Replied My Mother In Great Displeasure. Sarah Was Not Even Mentally Present At The Moment. She did Not Even Look At Us, The Entire Chat. She Was So Involved In That Book That Nothing Could Hold Her Interest In The Real World.

The Book In Her Hands Was A Mighty One, Brown In Colour, Crippled Pages, Anyone Who Looked At It Can Say That, That's An Old Ass Book. With Her, Turning Over The Pages, Wickedly Smiling At It, Gave A Sinister Appearance To The Book.

Three Of Us Were Horrified To Witness Sarah Behaving That Way. Right From The Return, She Had Stopped Communicating, Used To Only Come Out Of Her Room To Eat, That Too Holding The Book In Her Hands. Though I Did Not Tell Anyone, I Used To Freak Out Hearing A Guy Speaking Beside My Room, Late In The Nights.

One Tuesday, Mom Picked Up A Call From Her Brother. The Call Was From His Wife To Inform Mom About His Deteriorating Health. Mom Tried Her Best To Avoid The Visit Because Of Sarah, But She Couldn't Say No.

I Straight Up Asked My Mum To Take Me With Them. " I Can't Stay With Her, She's Weird," I Told My Mom. " Who Said That You're Alone, Don't You Know, Tommy's Staying With You," Mom Enraged. Tommy's Our Dog By The Way.

By 7 Pm, Mom And Dad Left for A Bus Stop Which Is Half A Mile Away From Home. It Takes About Three Hours To Reach My Uncle's Home. I Stand At The Gate, Waving My Hands At My Parents, A Water Droplet Falls On My Forehead, I Look Up And See, Cloud Crawling Across, Conquering The Sky, Battling The Moonlight, Giving Away A Warning To The City, To Get Prepared For The Noisy Fiercely Thunderstorm.

I Turn Back To Return, But See Something Unsettling. Sarah, At The Window, Staring At Me With a Smirk. There Was No Sight Of Light In Her Room As Well As On Her Face. I Could Sense The Unknown Forthcoming, Which Was Surely Unholy.

Entering The House, I Made Sure To Close All The Doors And Windows, Leaving No Chance For The Intruders. I Walked Past My Sister's Room, Which Had No Lights Turned On, Only Her Little Giggle Was Audible.

The Sight Of Peacock Trying To Get Into My Room By The Window To Avoid The Storm, Was Frustrating. I Always Felt Peacocks Are Devil's In Disguise. The Sound They Produced Was Utterly Disgusting. I Close The Window, Lie Down, And Turn On The Radio.

And To My Annoyance, As I Keep Tuning Different Stations, All I Hear Is, Them, Warning The People About The Storm. 

Hoping To Get Some Fresh Air, I Opened The Window. But The Storm Had Begun Already, Which Was About To Cause Chaos. The Thing I Always Hated About The Heavy Squalls Is That They Rip Apart The Poles, Causing No Electricity In The City.

I Lay Down, And Let My Health Anxiety Take Over The Mind, Which Resulted In Me Going On A Quest, Whether My Tremors Are Caused By ET Or Parkinson's, Or Maybe Dystonia, Or Even Multiple Sclerosis.

" No, Not This Soon," I Scream As The Light Goes Off. It Was A Bit Scary To Imagine Sitting Alone In A House Next To The Room Of An Unstable Lady, With No Electricity And Human Contact For About Half A Mile, Amidst A Thunderstorm.  We Crave For Solidarity Until We Lose Our Mind.

Minutes Into My Nap, I Hear A Mumble. I Sharp Down My Ears, And Pay Attention To The Sound. I Could Clearly Hear Two Voices Speaking. One Is Sarah And The Other One Is Not Known Yet. I Get Close To My Door, Only To Hear A Deep Male Voice, Mumbling Something In An Alien Language. "Who Is It?," I Say In Fear, The Voices Stop. Then, I Hear Someone Walking Towards My Door, Taking Deep Breaths. I Could Sense The Anger Behind Those Breaths. I Get Back To My Bed, Cover Myself Up With A Blanket, And See Through The Gap Between The Door And The Floor.

A Shadow Like Figure, Walking Near The Door, With Making No Sound, "Maybe A Burglar," I Thought. I Tried Asking It Another Four Times About Its Identity, "Sarah Is That You," But There Was No Response. All Of A Sudden, The Person Outside, Tries To Open The Knob, Thrust It, Kick It, Bang On It, To Get In. Felt Like I Was In A Panic Room.

In Great Fear, I Opened The Window, To Make It Out, Using The Tree, But The Heavy Squalls, Ripping Apart The Trees, Made It Futile. As I Opened The Window, The Peacocks In Fear, Crying For Help, Making An Unbearable, Unpleasant Sound, Which Was An Ache To The Ear, Acted Like A Background Score For The Situation.

In Between The Ghostly Figure Outside The Door, And The Roar Of The Peacocks, I Thought Of Fighting It Up. I Thought The Shadow Moving Around Was Of My Sister's, As She Was Weird. But The Voice Of The Male Was Still Questionable. 

I Get Down, Start Walking Towards The Door To Face The Unknown, While Watching The Shadow Move. The Peacocks Screams, Added To The Weather, Gave The Whole Scenario, An Unholy Vibe. With Tears Rolling Down Out Of Fear, I Open The Door, To Witness No One. But Later I Realised That Sarah's Door Was Open. I Take A Peek Into It, And See Sarah, Completely Naked, Touching The Tattoo On Her Shoulder, Smiling At It, And Laughing Out Loud In Great Joy, In Front Of The Mirror.

" You Scared Me Bitch," I Shout At Her. Dropping The Book In Her Hands, Slowly Making An Eye Contact Through The Mirror, " Watch Your Tongue," She Said, But In A Male's Voice. The Same One I Heard Before. 

Screwing Up My Eyes, I See Something Unusual. There Was Blood Dripping Out Of Sarah's Mouth, And The Tremor Was Making Things Worse. The Shaky Torch Falls On To Sarah's Face, Revealing A Piece Of Flesh In Her Mouth, Staring At Me Surly. When I Hit The Torch Down Near Her Legs, I See Tommy Tattered, With Head Decapitated.

Stupefied, For A Second, I Thought I Was Paralyzed. "Noo!," I Screamed, And Ran With No Second Thought. Amidst Running Downstairs, I Hear Someone's Footsteps Chasing Me, And I Did Not Turn Back. I Just Kept Running To The Front Door, Avoiding The Footsteps Behind Me. I Reach The Door, Open It, To Face The Storm, Which Is In No Mood To Let Me Pass The Isolated Area We Live In.

I Run Through The Meadows, Weary All The Time, To Get A View Of Humanity. Had To Run Half A Mile, With No Light, Amidst Storm, With Heavy Squalls. The Whole Time, I Thought I Was All Alone, But I Was Wrong. There Was Fear Which Helped Me Get Through The Obstacles Of The Night. The Fear Of Being Chased, The Fear Of Thunderstorms And Mainly The Fear Of Footsteps, Which I Could Clearly Hear The Whole Time, Despite The Noisy Storm.

And The Fear Loftily Helped Me Get To The Bus Station, Where I Could See People Sleeping On The Benches, Awaiting For Their Journey. Once I Got In There, The Scream Of Rejoice, After Escaping The Maze, Disrupted The Peace Of The Awaiting Passengers, Who Then Kicked Me Out Of The Premises.

But I Shamelessly Grin, Emitting The Happiness, And Then Cry Out Loud.
