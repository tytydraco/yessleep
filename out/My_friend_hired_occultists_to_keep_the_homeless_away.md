The restaurant where I worked as a part-timer, *Blue Mile*, was located in the heart of New Orleans. Built in the 1970s, it was neither the first nor the last Blue Mile restaurant in the state—at least, not until 1999, when the company behind it shut down after declaring bankruptcy. Many people may have speculated about the cause, but the truth is, the New Orleans location played a significant role in the company's downfall.

Blue Mile specialized in hamburgers, and despite McDonald's dominance in New Orleans, its homemade-style burgers gave it a unique charm in the city's burger scene. In the 1990s, Burger King wasn’t much of a competitor in the area, making the battle for burger supremacy a two-way fight between McDonald's and Blue Mile.

It all started with me. And while I never committed anything morally or ethically wrong, I still feel responsible for the company's demise.

I began working at Blue Mile in 1993 for one reason—student loans. In fact, many of the part-timers at the restaurant were in the same boat. How did I know? Because most of them were from my campus. Our restaurant employed eight students from around the city—six of them attended my school, and of those six, five were in my class. The one exception was a guy named Michael, who had been in my high school class before we took different paths in university.

It was at Blue Mile where we met again, exchanging phone numbers to make sure we wouldn’t lose contact. Maybe grab some drinks when we got bored on campus.

During the day, Blue Mile was just another burger joint. But at night? It was basically a building in the middle of the damn hood. It sat in the middle of a park, which, by extension, was also the brightest spot there—making it a magnet for the homeless. And with that came all the usual problems: drug deals, prostitutes, violence. Despite its popularity, the restaurant had terrible parking, meaning customers had to walk through the chaos just to get inside.

That’s when we started putting our heads together to figure out what to do about the situation. One night, we decided to turn off all the restaurant’s lights. Most of the homeless people, afraid of the dark, moved elsewhere, though some stayed to sleep.

In the office, our boss suggested hiring security guards. But that would eat into our paychecks since their salaries had to come from somewhere. Obviously, paying gangsters for “protection” was out of the question.

The problem was, hiring security wasn’t just expensive—there was no one available. Every freelance guard was either already booked or demanding more pay than we could afford. If we went that route, our wages would take a hit.

That’s when Michael returned the next day with people we didn’t expect, didn’t welcome—but who could solve our problems.

A lot of the part-timers like us knew who they were since they were also students at the university—members of the most hated club on campus. *Coven.* Yeah, this isn’t some slang for something. I mean actual people obsessed with the occult. Don’t ask me how the school even managed to attract enough people to form a damn witch cult.

Look, I don’t actually believe in all that magical mumbo jumbo, but being surrounded by people who *do*? That was a whole new level of uncomfortable. I’m talking about:a) people who genuinely believe in this stuff, and by extension,b) the fact that I was surrounded by devil worshippers.

Another reason I didn’t want them around me personally? My family. Grandpa is a church elder, Dad is a reverend, and I go to church every week. Being surrounded by people who are basically *enemies of the church* felt pretty damn suspicious. And it wasn’t just religious reasons that made me hate them—I remember exactly when they showed up. September 3rd. Literally not even a month after the Euronymous incident happened, and it was *their* kind who did it. So yeah, I didn’t just dislike them for what they stood for; I hated them because they were *genuinely* terrifying.

But hey, an enemy of an enemy is a friend, right? Ever since those pentagram-worshipping creeps started patrolling Blue Mile at night, the number of homeless people causing trouble dropped. Sure, that was one good thing, but it didn’t mean I liked them being here.

The others, though? They had a different take. They found them useful, and instead of thinking about the long-term consequences, they decided to let them guard the place. But of course, there was a catch—the leader of the cult had one condition. In exchange for their protection, we weren’t allowed to badmouth them or talk trash about their practices.

I couldn’t help but wonder… *Did they actually think this was a win-win situation?*

But the boss didn’t care as long as the people keeping the restaurant safe were trustworthy.

However, that wasn’t even the worst part of their interference. In fact, the worst thing about them didn’t even come from them.

Michael started hanging out with them. I mean, sure, at first, since he was the one who brought those bastards into the scene, I expected this to happen. It made sense that Michael would spend more time with them since they seemed to be his friends—if they weren’t, they wouldn’t even be here, considering those occultists had a "only people in our circle are friends" mindset.

The problem was that Michael started neglecting his job as a part-timer, spending too much time chatting with the goat worshippers. So one day, I decided to confront him and tell him to focus on his work.

The day he finally decided to take his job seriously was when we realized just how much he had neglected because of them. The bin was overflowing—emptying it had been Michael’s responsibility yesterday, but since today it was my turn, I had to do extra work to clean up the restaurant and make sure it wasn’t a mess.

My task was to take out the garbage and bring it to the big bin at the edge of the parking lot. That side of the lot had a trash bin surrounded by folded used boxes and food scraps—sometimes homeless people rummaged through it. There was no footpath leading there, so I had to pass the payphone at the restaurant entrance and walk toward the bin along the road.



As I emptied the trash bin, I was about to head back when I stepped onto the sidewalk and heard a phone ringing. At first, I thought it was mine, but the ringtone was unfamiliar—louder and sharper than anything I had set.

That was when I realized it was the payphone.

I had never heard a payphone ring before. In fact, I had never even thought about the idea of payphones ringing back instead of us dialing them. For a few moments, I just stood there, frozen. But then my boss yelled at me for getting distracted—right at the moment the ringing stopped.

I forgot about the payphone until later, when I was tasked with emptying another trash bin, the one used by customers.

I was going to avoid the payphone this time, but as soon as I stepped out of the entrance, it rang again.

At first, I thought it was some kind of prank by the demon worshippers, but then I realized this wasn’t something they would do. Before I knew it, I was holding the receiver.

"Hello?"

There was no voice. Just silence—no, not silence. There was a sound. A faint whooshing, like wind. Then the crackling of fire. And then, I heard it.

Screams.

It wasn’t the wind. It wasn’t just noise. It was people screaming. Distant but unmistakable.

I stood there, listening for a few seconds, too stunned to move. Then my boss yelled at me again, snapping me out of it.

But I couldn’t shake it this time. I knew, deep down, that something was on the other side of that phone. Something dangerous.

The sounds haunted me for the rest of my shift. The echoes of children screaming made me flinch at random moments, and loud noises startled me more than usual. Eventually, Michael noticed. He called me out on it, demanding an explanation. Expecting him not to believe me, I just said I was stressed.

But I wasn’t lying to myself. I knew what I had heard. And it was anything but normal.

The restaurant closed at 9 P.M. That night, Michael and I were the last to leave, as the boss had asked us to stay behind for extra work, promising a bonus. Greedy as I was, I agreed. We were supposed to prepare for a birthday event the next day—cleaning the floors with stronger detergents while wearing different uniforms to avoid slipping.

We both looked like crime scene cleaners, especially with the masks. We also looked like anime cliché characters—a dumbo, a big guy, and a smartass. The dumbo being me, for obvious reasons.

When we started scrubbing, I realized that when the boss said, *“scrub the floor,”* he didn’t mean it literally. We were actually supposed to pick up trash and throw it away—not in the big bin outside, but in the smaller one inside the restaurant. Still, I kept scrubbing, half-forcing Michael to do what I was supposed to be doing.

As Michael walked past me, he suddenly stopped.

“What the hell…”

I froze at his tone. It wasn’t the voice of someone stressed or pissed about me slacking off. It was something else—something that sent a chill down my spine.

I turned to see what he was looking at. It was a photo of our restaurant staff, including us part-timers. But something was wrong.

The part where our faces were supposed to be—ripped. And not just torn off, but shredded, like something had clawed through the photo.

Someone was definitely messing with us, trying to scare us. It wasn’t even a full minute before all three of us started suspecting those occultist pricks. They were always playing weird pranks, trying to make it seem like our entire restaurant was cursed.

Or was it really them? We had no proof. We were just jumping to conclusions because we could. Michael, of course, defended them, as expected.

But not this time, punk.

The boss ordered me to keep an eye on the occultists and assigned Michael to the kitchen tomorrow. Good for me—not only would I get out of doing real work, but maybe I’d find a reason to finally get those guys kicked out.

A win-win situation. Even for the boss, since he already suspected Michael of neglecting his duties—maybe even helping those pricks. And even though I was the dumb one, it was starting to seem like Michael didn’t know the full extent of what was going on.

But when we laid it all out, Michael called us paranoid. He insisted he wasn’t the kind of guy who’d let his friends mess with his workplace.

I told him *he* wasn’t the problem. His friends were.

But Michael swore he never saw a single one of them leave their designated area outside the restaurant.

I narrowed my eyes.

“How can you be so sure?” I asked.



That was when I realized he was hiding something because he went quiet—our boss caught that and ordered him to speak up unless he wanted the police involved. But that was likely to happen even if he did open his mouth.

Just behind the restaurant, where our food scraps were thrown out, was usually clean, but what was in the middle of the ground made my blood boil—a literal pentagram. Not just any pentagram, but the occult kind, the classic ‘star in a circle’ nonsense, with some Latin mumbo jumbo I had no intention of figuring out. But one thing was clear—our new bodyguards were literally practicing devil worship behind our restaurant.

I honestly wanted to grab Michael and scream at him. And I’m sure the boss felt the same way. But instead of yelling, he ordered Michael to clean up this demonic nonsense before some scandal broke out—and he made sure Michael did it alone. As for the boss and me, we decided to check the security footage to see what had happened to our photos and who was responsible.

What we were greeted with was a glitch in the system, making it impossible to review today’s footage.

Great.

The boss told me to leave and promised Michael that his pay would be docked if one of his friends was behind this. As I headed to the station, a sense of looming dread crept over me. And as if that dread was some kind of curse, the payphone rang again the moment I stepped out of the restaurant.

Was this another prank from those devil worshippers? If that was the case, someone was definitely stalking me. And considering who they were and what they did today, I didn’t stick around to find out. I paced toward the station and hurried to my dorm as fast as possible, praying those pricks wouldn’t chase me down and sacrifice me to some goat.

Once inside my dorm, I tried to calm my thoughts. I decided to read the Bible to clear my mind of all the nonsense those lunatics had pulled today. After a few minutes of scripture reading, I took a shower. But as I was about to get dressed, I noticed one of my lecture assignments sitting on the table—the assignment for my Archaeology class.

The goal of the Archaeology assignment was to discuss an ancient artifact from New Orleans and explain what made it significant compared to other archaeological discoveries.

First of all, the artifact I was covering was something huge. Second—what I was discussing was what people believed to be the manifestation of a gate to Hell.

"The Gate of Topman" was discovered in our city a few decades ago at an archaeological site that I had tried to find. I had even dragged my reverend father along to see if there was anything more to it. The Gate of Topman was said to be one of the most—if not *the* most—cursed artifacts in archaeological history, even more than Tutankhamun’s tomb or the crystal skull.

Fifteen people died during the unearthing process alone, and many others who visited the site fell mysteriously ill, despite no traces of radiation or viruses being found. The entire archaeological site is now covered by a building, and since then, there have been no further reports of a curse.

Even I felt that curse—I had to spend two weeks recovering from pneumonia just days after my first visit to that damned place. But was it really the curse? I overcame it, went back multiple times, and nothing happened.

I still wanted to find the site and see what was there. I contacted my dad, but he told me there were no clues yet.

I went to bed—not disappointed, but preparing for tomorrow since I had to submit my assignment early. Then, I woke up again at 2 A.M. A dream of the restaurant burning jolted me awake. In my dream, demon worshippers had set it on fire. Was it a prediction? Unlikely. But was it a warning to keep distrusting them? Absolutely.

That was when the rage I had been harboring finally exploded. I knew I was risking my friendship with Michael, but I needed him to understand—I didn’t want those creeps coming back to our restaurant, not even as customers. They had done their devil worship behind the building and ripped up our photos.

Did they really do that?

That was my second thought. If Michael was right, the only confirmed event tied to the occultists was the pentagram markings.

Then who ripped the photo? That was my next question. The logical explanation? One of those pricks must have snuck in and done it without anyone noticing.

I went back to sleep, woke up the next day, did my chores, and headed to campus. After submitting my assignment, I started looking for Michael.

During my search, I stopped by a campus bar called *Shadow*—a name that practically screamed demonic influence, especially with its dark atmosphere. Sure enough, a group of those occultists was there. I considered confronting them, but just as I was about to act—like some scene out of a movie—Michael grabbed me.

He asked why I was stalking them and acting weird.

He wasn’t joking. We moved to another spot—not because I listened to him, but because I couldn't hold back my fury anymore. The nerve of him to call *me* the weirdo when he was literally friends with people who bowed their heads over red pentagrams!

What pissed me off the most was that he was choosing *them* over me. Not that I’m obsessive or anything, but any sane person knows befriending satanists is a *huge* no-no.

Michael saw things differently. He said we should treat each other with kindness, as people—as *normal* people.

How?

I reminded him about Euronymous—those freaks were involved, and now, suddenly, Michael wanted to “treat them normally”? I wasn’t about to normalize their behavior, especially after what they did to our restaurant. The pentagrams, the ripped photos, and that constant ringing sound every time I stepped outside—it was all shady.

Michael then hit me with the question that made me pause.

“What proof do you have that *they* did it?”

I was about to scream, but I stopped. He had a point. Until the security camera was fixed, there was no solid evidence linking our *new* bodyguards to the vandalism.

Still, I wasn’t about to let my guard down. I promised to keep an eye on them, and Michael just shrugged, saying, “Go for it.”

It felt like a battle I had won but somehow lost. I’m a Christian—I should be *loving* the sinner.

Maybe I should hate what they *do*, not what they *are*. And by that, I meant their vandalism, not their existence.

That evening, Michael and I worked our shift together, but we kept our distance. Two friends, now filled with distrust.

But the night passed without incident—no vandalism, no trouble. It was peaceful. The only thing still bothering me was that the security camera wasn’t working. Had Michael said something to them? I had no idea. But those demon worshippers were unusually quiet.

I didn’t see them again until my cigarette break. They were patrolling the area like they were supposed to, never saying a word to me. I knew they were aware that I was watching them.

While I was outside, the boss showed up. I expected a scolding, but instead, he looked genuinely confused. He gestured for me to follow him, and I knew where this was going.

Back in the surveillance room, I saw it—the camera that wasn’t working yesterday was *fixed*.

And the weirdest part? The boss never called a repairman. He said it just *fixed itself*. Maybe it was just a glitch.

Or maybe it wasn’t.

As we reviewed the surveillance camera footage, we realized something was off. When we checked the board with the photos on it, trying to figure out which prick was behind damaging them, we didn’t see anyone approach. Instead, the scratch marks just appeared—automatically. No claws, no weapons, nothing. The marks simply crossed the photo as if someone invisible had done it.

We checked the footage multiple times. Not a single person was seen in the surrounding area. The closest person was a customer, eating a burger at the moment the scratches appeared. Yet—he didn’t react. He kept eating, as if he hadn’t heard or noticed anything.

But then, we saw him get up and stare at the photo. I guess he was thinking, *Were the photos always damaged?*

My eyes aren’t bad. I can spot things from far away, even in blurry footage. But this security camera wasn’t blurry—it was clear. And still, the claw marks just appeared.

I reviewed the footage again and saw movement from outside—it was me. I was walking into the kitchen after getting that phone call from God knows who. And as soon as I entered the building, the scratch marks appeared. That cemented the fact that I wasn’t behind it.

No. I *wish* I was behind it. Because then, at least, there would be a logical explanation.

Our focus on the camera was broken when Boss’s cell phone rang.

“Give me a minute,” he said, pulling out his phone. But the ringing continued. He didn’t answer—he just stared at his screen. Then, he turned the phone to show me the caller’s number, and that’s when I knew something was seriously wrong.

All sixes. As if the devil himself was calling. The number was *666-6666.*

That was when I *felt* it—something else was in the restaurant with us. Immediately, my mind went to those devil worshippers. This had to be their joke. Their doing. I *knew* it. And I was ready to argue with them.

We skipped the footage forward to the present and found the demon worshippers at the back of the restaurant, drinking and drawing another pentagram.

I ran outside to check if they were actually doing it or if the video had been manipulated. Sure enough, they were there—drinking, smoking, and surrounding the bloody pentagram they’d made. I wanted to scream at them to rub it out, but I had more important things to deal with.

That’s when I noticed—none of them were holding a phone.

All of them were there, empty-handed, holding beers or cigarettes. No phones.

I ran back to Boss to see if his phone was still ringing. It was. Someone was still calling him. And despite my attempts to stop him, he answered.

Immediately, Boss yelled as a loud, bloodcurdling scream blasted through the speaker.

The chilling part wasn’t just the scream—it was that I had *heard it before*.

It was the same scream I’d heard from the payphone. Louder now. And in the background, I could hear something burning. When Boss turned the volume down, I recognized another sound—wind. The same eerie wind I had heard in the background of that weird payphone call.

I moved toward the exit, trying to escape the horrible sound. Whatever was happening on that call was disturbing enough. But I *knew* that scream. And I didn’t want the Boss to realize I recognized it.

As I limped toward the cashier, I noticed Michael doing the same—heading in the same direction, also limping.

Then, he screamed.

I looked up.

Flames.

Flames engulfed Michael.

The scream I heard wasn’t a terrified cry—it was a scream of pure agony. The sound of someone *burning alive*.

Right in front of me.

Thick smoke filled the room, swallowing me whole. By the time it reached my eyes, everything went pitch black.

At first, I had no idea what happened. But when the smoke cleared, I found myself surrounded by staff members. Boss looked frantic. The others looked pale—some sweating, some burnt, some even crying.

I realized then—I had passed out. Boss must’ve caught me before I hit the ground and cracked my head open.

For a moment, I thought it was just a nightmare. But it wasn’t.

I could still smell the fire.

And then I saw it.

A body.

A blackened, charred corpse lying in front of me.

Michael was missing. And in that instant, I knew.

It was him.

Michael’s demonic friends surrounded his body, desperately trying to revive him. But not with magic. Not with rituals. They were doing *CPR*. Mouth-to-mouth. Anything to bring him back.

They all looked terrified.

Even *they* knew—this was beyond their control.

Twenty minutes later, paramedics arrived at the scene and immediately declared Michael dead. The restaurant closed for the day, and I was ordered to go home.

Autopsy results were released a few days later to his family, who shared them with us. The cause of death was listed as burning, though the exact cause was unknown. It seemed as if Michael had burned to death for no apparent reason, almost as if he had been engulfed in flames magically.

I headed to the dorm and started packing my things—until my dad, the reverend, called me. His voice was a mix of excitement and fear, and what he told me was about the Gate of Topman and what he had uncovered.

I started taking notes as he began telling the story of our artifact.

*“Well, you might not be surprised, but it seems there’s more to Topman’s Gate. I don’t know what kind of demons took control of the door, but their curse is so powerful that the entire area where the archaeological site was located is cursed as well.”*

I scribbled down the information.

*“Apparently, there’s a building on top of it. I think it was a restaurant built a few years ago, but other reverends say the place is cursed as hell.”*

Wait.

*“Blue Mile… such a weird name. I heard there was a fire there a few days ago. Perhaps the ruins of the archaeological site are harboring that curse? I mean, some employees even said paranormal things have happened there—so much so that they wouldn’t even dare visit again. The fire must have something to do with it.”*

I dropped my pencil and realized where this was going.

When the phone call ended, I stared at the TV, which was reporting the incident at the restaurant a few days ago. A photo of Michael, the victim, was displayed in the corner of the screen, alongside security footage of the demon worshippers.

At first, I thought the demon worshippers were behind the mess, whether it was a curse or not—that they were the reason things happened at Blue Mile.

But it seems that Blue Mile attracted them.
