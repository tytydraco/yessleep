There’s a murderer in the room with me.

Small, unassuming—you wouldn’t know it from the look, but I’m certain that at least eleven lives have been cut short by this killer.

For fourteen years, I’ve kept the secret; fourteen years, I haven’t told a soul.

Because I knew that if I did, more would die.

\*\*\*\*

The Anderson home sat atop a small hill on a one-acre lot just outside of town. While by no means a mansion, it was a well-kept, respectable residence with a flower garden that won several local awards.

As the name suggests, in the mid 80s, it was inhabited by the Anderson family. Father, Tim, worked in sales, and had inherited the house from his parents—mother, Denice, worked in real estate—and daughters, Kate and Julia, aged seventeen and fifteen respectively, attended the public high school.

Julia was athletic, and tall amongst her peers. Playing several sports, including soccer and softball, she had a large group of friends and was considered quite popular in her class. Tim coached some of her teams, and Denice was always to be found in the stands loudly cheering.

Kate was precisely the opposite of her sister—she never once set foot on a basketball court or attempted running track. Instead, she dressed in mostly black and snuck cigarettes behind the gymnasium at recess. Still, though she was not as widely well-liked as Julia, she did have a small, close-knit group of friends that bonded over one thing in particular.

Studying the occult.

Tim and Denice were fairly active in their church and, it’s said, were none too pleased with their older daughter’s interest in…unholy topics. They dragged her to service every Sunday and forced her into Bible study, but it seemed to have the opposite effect they intended—Kate only became more fascinated with the other side of the coin.

Kate and her friends studied Latin and were frequently known to speak to each other in it. They passed notes in class that only they could translate, and hissed insults at other students that only they understood. After complaints from several parents that their children were worried that the “satanic kids” were putting spells on them, the school warned Kate and company that they’d be suspended if they continued with their “demonic nonsense.”

But the warning wasn’t enough. During a free period, a janitor caught them conducting a “ritual” in a dark, empty classroom—complete with candles and a pentagram drawn on the blackboard, and they were all suspended for a week.

That was the last straw for the Anderson parents—they put Kate on lockdown. She was grounded indefinitely and was to have no contact with her friends—only being allowed to leave her room to use the restroom or for meals with the family.

And then, on the second day of the suspension, Tim and Denice awoke to a nightmare.

Kate hung herself.

She was found dangling in her closet when her mother entered to rouse her for breakfast—a noose made from a rope that no one recognized wrapped around her neck.

The Andersons were crushed.

Yes, she’d been a problematic child, but they’d still loved her deeply. Tim and Denice had been hoping that the suspension would be good for her—that some time away from her friends would maybe help turn her around.

Now she was gone—and they didn’t understand why. She left no note or explanation—she hadn’t been known to be depressed. And, when questioned, her friends all said that she’d never talked of harming herself—they were all as shocked as her parents were, and were just as devasted by her loss.

Worst impacted, though, was Julia.

While it may not have been obvious to an outside observer, Julia had actually been very close with her sister, and looked up to her in many ways. Julia admired that Kate didn’t care what anyone else thought of her, and that she was truly comfortable with who she was—something that Julia often struggled with.

In the days immediately afterwards, Julia sobbed nearly constantly. Everyone did what they could to console her, yet it was largely to no avail, and they mostly thought it best to just let her grieve—knowing that the passage of time would be the only thing that could start the healing.

However, at some point shortly after Kate’s death, Julia’s behavior changed…

She still sobbed, that part remained the same, but it’s said that it wasn’t sadness they saw on her face anymore.

It was fear.

Julia became paranoid—her eyes darted wildly around any room that she was in, and she jumped when anyone spoke to her. Friends tried to ask her what she was so afraid of, but she refused to tell them—stating only that they should leave her alone.

Worried, they wondered if she might be in some sort of danger—if maybe there was more to Kate’s suicide than the Andersons were saying. And those fears were seemingly confirmed when the unthinkable happened.

Julia was found hanging in her bedroom too.

Where the rest of the town had been initially nothing but supporting of Tim and Denice, now they were suspicious. Kate’s death had been a tragedy, no doubt, but she had also been somewhat of a pariah. It wasn’t surprising to many that the girl that dressed in black and hung out with a “creepy” crowd had been troubled enough tie her own noose.

But Julia…Julia had been so full of life. So energetic—such a beacon of positivity to her teammates and peers—no one believed that she would have done that to herself.

So, an investigation into the girls’ untimely demises was conducted—forensics were investigated—Tim and Denice were both questioned at length. But there was no evidence that they’d done anything wrong, and neither of them confessed to any wrongdoing. In fact, neither of them spoke much at all after Julia’s passing—or ever went back to church—or ever went back to work.

With nothing to say otherwise, Kate and Julia’s deaths were both officially ruled as suicides, and the Andersons were left to return home to their empty nest—one that had once held so much promise.

It was thought that it was only a matter of time before one or both of them might be found dangling from a rope themselves. But instead, a month or so after Julia died, a moving truck showed up at the Anderson home. Neighbors saw boxes quickly being loaded, and then, without a word to anyone in town, they just drove away—leaving many of their larger items behind.

The house was already paid off and was never put up on the market. And someone continued to pay the property taxes every year, so the locals wondered if one day, Tim and Denice might move back in.

But they never did—their home remained vacant from then on.

Often, it was pondered why they didn’t sell it, but the assumption was that even though they couldn’t bear to ever return, they also couldn’t bear to lose the place where their daughters had lived their entire, short lives.

So, year after year, it loomed over the residents below, slowly being reclaimed by nature. A decaying reminder of two young women, taken far too early.

\*\*\*\*

That’s, at least, how the events were relayed as local legend.

By the time I was born, the house had already sat empty for five years—the once, award-winning flower garden was overgrown with weeds, the paint was flecked and peeling, and many of the windows were shattered.

I, obviously, never knew any of the Andersons personally, but I knew their story by heart before I was in the fourth grade. Every kid in Willow Grove heard it eventually—either from an older sibling, or a friend who’d heard it from an older sibling, or from a friend of a friend who’d heard it from an older sibling—it passed by oral tradition from one generation to the next.

There were verifiable facts contained within. The home did indeed belong to a Tim and Denice Anderson—both of their names were on the title. And the Anderson girls had definitely attended Willow Grove High School—a trophy bearing Julia’s name sat in a case near the gym, and Kate could be found in old yearbooks.

Kate and Julia had also, most certainly, died of hanging within days of one another—newspapers covering the story at the time were archived in the library.

As for the details of their behavior, those came from classmates of the girls and church-members that knew Tim and Denice. It was the main topic of gossip among the townspeople for many, many years, as nothing else of note ever really happened in Willow Grove.

Until fourteen years ago.

Given the fact that two unbelievably tragic deaths occurred within its walls, the Anderson home was purported to be deeply haunted. Throughout my childhood, I heard many different versions of ways one could have an encounter there.

“If you look into the middle window on the second floor during a thunderstorm, you’ll see a girl hanging when there’s a flash of lightning.”

“If you sneak into the house after midnight, you can hear Julia crying in her room.”

“If you’re in Kate’s bedroom at 3:00am—the time when they suspect she hung herself—you’ll feel as if something is tightening around your neck and you’ll struggle to breathe.”

In time, it became a rite of passage for every teen in town to spend a few hours after dark in the house at some point during their high school career. They always returned with thrilling tales of having been chased through the halls by angry spirits, or being hauled up into the air by their throats—most of it was surely pure fabrication. But still, to the students of WGHS, having done your “hanging night” was considered just as important a qualification for graduation as passing all your final exams.

And so it was that on the evening of February 10th, 2010, I entered the Anderson home with my two best friends, Freddy and James.

\*\*\*\*

James Wheeler and I had been inseparable since kindergarten—a pairing based on nothing more than both thinking that the velociraptor was the coolest dinosaur, yet it was enough to bond us for life.

He was a skinny boy of eighteen, with dark, brown hair and matching eyes—taller than me but shorter than Freddy.

Freddy King had joined our party-of-two during our freshman year at WGHS. He transferred in from another school when his dad moved to town for some consulting work, and quickly inserted himself into our lives. Far more outgoing that either James or I, he had boisterously introduced himself saying that he’d heard that “you two like video games” and then said, “we’re going to be friends.”

Eighteen-years-old in 2010 as well, he had a build to play football, but never went out for the team. Instead, most nights, the three of us all felt a certain call to duty, and spent hours dominating our enemies together online.

And, unlike James or I, Freddy was also what one would have considered “classically good looking”—his blonde hair and blue eyes attracted the attention of several girls in our class, and his perfect teeth had never needed braces.

Because of this, Freddy had to occasionally miss our evening gaming sessions when he was out on dates. And, after one such night, he caught up with us at the next day at school looking exasperated.

“Guys, you know how I’ve been seeing Heather, right?” He asked.

I smirked—of course we knew about him and Heather—half the school was talking about how the head cheerleader was dating that “hot nerd.”

“Yea dude, we’re part of ‘everybody,’ so we made that very exclusive list of people who know.” James snarked at him.

I laughed, and Freddy looked a little embarrassed when he replied, “Shut up, assholes. Look, I need to talk to you guys about something.”

His expression was very serious—I couldn’t help but give a sarcastic response.

“She gave you herpes?”

“No! Fuck you, man!” He tried to look angry, but I could see the smile on his face as he threw a light jab at my shoulder.

“Alright, alright—what’s up with you and Heather?” James diffused the situation.

“Okay, so last night, we were hanging out at her place and she wanted to watch a scary movie—I guess she likes horror. So, she asked which was my favorite and I told her that I didn’t have one ‘cause I don’t really believe in ghosts or anything and prefer comedies.

“Well, she was a little put off by that…” James and I both rolled our eyes at how stupid he’d been. “Yea, yea I know, I fucked up—I shoulda just said I loved horror and named like literally any movie I know in that genre, but anyway—she asked if I really didn’t believe, or if I was just a big scaredy cat because she ‘can’t be dating a pussy.’

“And, I told her that I wasn’t scared of that stuff, I just had never had any paranormal experiences and didn’t think ghosts or monsters were real.”

I cut him off, “Dude, you gonna get to the point anytime soon? We’ll be in college before you finish this story.”

“Fine. Long story short, she wants me to do the ‘hanging night’ to prove I’m not a ‘little bitch’.”

For someone that claimed to not believe in ghosts, I couldn’t help but notice the touch of anxiety in his eyes as he said it.

“Seriously?” James chortled. “I thought we agreed a long time ago that that was a dumb tradition.”

“Yea man,” I added, “Plus, I mean…yea I know like everyone does it, but two girls died there—it’s super fuckin’ sad. I always thought the whole thing was kinda, I dunno, disrespectful, I guess.”

Freddy sighed, “Okay, valid points, and agreed it’s stupid, but…have you seen Heather? She told me that if I do it, and bring back some proof, I’ll be ‘rewarded’.” His expression went vacant, no doubt envisioning Heather’s prize for his bravery.

“Dude, c’mon, there’s gotta be easier ways for you to get laid.” I was beginning to understand that Freddy was not asking for our opinion—he’d already made up his mind.

And James appeared to have made the same connection as he said next, “You’re doing this with or without us, aren’t you?”

Freddy gave us the same look that he had when he told us that he was going to be our friend years earlier. “No…I’m not going to do it without you because you’re both coming. You know that I’d do it for either of you.”

Neither James or I could argue this point—if either of us had even had the slightest chance with a girl, Freddy would have done anything to make it happen for us.

“When are we doing this?” James asked.

“Tonight.”

\*\*\*\*

On the night of the 10th, Freddy told his parents that he was going to James’ house to study—James told his that he was going to mine—and I told mine that I was going to Freddy’s. All of us said we’d be back to our own homes by 10pm, as it was a school night, and then set off for the Andersons’ around seven.

It had rained earlier, and the sky remained overcast. As the sun had set shortly after six, we knew we’d soon be in total darkness, and used flashlights that Freddy had snuck from his garage to guide our way.

There was a well-worn path through the woods to the backyard of the Anderson home. Over twenty years-worth of miscreants looking for a thrill had beaten a trail through the brush, and it continued through the overgrown yard leading directly to the backdoor.

For a time, the police had kept an eye on the place and arrested trespassers, but there were just too many to corral. They would have needed to hire an officer fulltime to watch the house at night, and there simply wasn’t funding for it. And, with no indication that the Andersons would ever return, nor seeming to care for any of the possessions they’d left behind, eventually the entire town made a silent agreement to let the local teens go on their little “ghost hunts” without impedance.

As we approached the home, we listened to see if any others had decided that tonight would be their “hanging night” as well, but heard no sounds coming through the broken windows, so we continued on. We knew from other’s stories that the backdoor was always unlocked and Freddy, being in the lead, was the one to open it and enter first.

James and I followed cautiously behind him to see that it was pitch black within—our flashlights the only source of illumination.

The door opened into a mudroom, where coat hangers lay scattered across the floor and a thick layer of dust had settled over an old washer and dryer. Scuff marks on the floor indicated that this area was well-trafficked, but they lessened where the tile transitioned to the hardwood of the hallway ahead, and I wondered if this was as far as many people made it into the home—too afraid to continue deeper.

Freddy was, however, determined that he’d prove his manhood to Heather by going for the full-experience—which meant that we were going to need to spend at least two, full hours in the house, and that we’d need to enter both Julia and Kate’s rooms.

So, we navigated further inside, stepping into the hallway that branched off to the kitchen, dining room, and living room. Shining my light along the walls as I went, I noticed initials and dates had been etched into them. It seemed many that made it past the mudroom wanted to leave a mark proving that they’d done so.

Now, at this point, I’ll mention that I was terrified the minute we walked through the door. I would never have admitted it to either of them, but I most definitely believed in ghosts at the time, and I most definitely felt uncomfortable invading somewhere that had played host to such horrific events.

The only things that kept me moving forward were the fact that I was with my two best friends—who even if they were scared themselves, were both doing their best impressions of nonchalance—and that hundreds of others had done this same thing, and no one had died in the house since Julia.

As I was considering this, and listening intently for the slightest sound other than our careful footsteps, Freddy’s voice made me jump.

“Think we should carve our names in the wall?” He whispered.

“No—I don’t want a record that we were in here in case the Andersons ever come back.” The reason I gave aloud was different than the reason in my head—I really didn’t want to potentially upset Julia and Kate by defiling their house.

“Yea, good point. Well, might as well take a look around if we’re gonna be here for a while.” He spoke uneasily, and I was somewhat relieved to hear a hint of wavering in his words—at least I knew I wasn’t the only one that was feeling anxious.

James and I started in the kitchen, while Freddy made his way through the living and dining rooms, but there really wasn’t much to see. All of the kitchen drawers and cabinets had been emptied, and the only items remaining in the living or dining rooms were a few large, grimy pieces of furniture. There were lighter spots on the tattered wallpaper where it was obvious that family photos or artwork had once hung, and the curtains on the windows were moth-bitten.

It was deeply unsettling—the abandonment struck a nerve somewhere inside me, and a knot twisted in my stomach.

“Think we should head upstairs?” Freddy asked, as we regrouped at the base of the steps.

“You first.” I nudged him.

I heard him take a sharp inhale, as if steeling himself, before he slowly crept his way up to the second floor.

James threw me an insecure glance, but then nodded, and we went next.

My ears had never been so primed for sound. Pausing for a moment after making the ascent, I realized that outside of James and Freddy’s footfalls, I heard nothing. No ambient noise—no cars, no crickets, no bats—I’d never understood before that moment how loud silence could be. I became acutely aware of the rapidity of my heartbeat by the pulses reverberating in my eardrums.

“Guys, come check this out.” Freddy’s light shone from inside the first door on the right of the upper hallway, and James and I went through it to meet him.

Based on the local lore, we had undoubtedly entered into Kate’s bedroom.

The walls were painted black and on them, several pentagrams had been spray-painted or etched in. There were other odd symbols here and there, too, that I didn’t recognize, but I got the feeling that Kate hadn’t likely done any of it herself.

As with the lower floor, the furniture had been left behind, but everything else had been removed. There was nothing on the desk or the bedside tables, nothing inside the dresser drawers—the entire space gave an air of emptiness.

I didn’t like being inside the room. The silence was even more complete there than it had been in the hallway—even our movements felt muffled. And, I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching us—someone just out of view—someone that always managed to duck out of my flashlight beam whenever I moved it.

Then, behind me, I heard what sounded like a sliding door opening and suddenly…

“FUCK!” Freddy yelled, and I felt his weight shake the floor.

I whipped around, and shined my light to see that he was on his back, having tripped over his own feet when he’d stumbled away from the closet he’d just opened.

I saw what had made him jump—hanging from the clothes-rack inside the closet, was a noose.

My stomach dropped at once, ‘Were we about the see the phantom of Kate?!’ I wondered.

But then James walked forward boldly and touched it—nothing happened.

“It’s a prank…” He reasoned. “Just a prank. I bet some asshole hung this up in here to scare the shit out of people.”

I let out the breath I’d been holding and heard Freddy do the same—he slowly got back to his feet and picked up his flashlight.

“Let’s get out of here.” He said; I could see that he was now thoroughly shaken.

“Like leave the house?” I asked, hopefully.

“No, just out of this room—I don’t like it in here…”

He walked back out into the hallway and I heard him traipsing in the opposite direction from the stairs. James and I hung back, still trying to calm down, and I checked my phone—it was nearing 8pm—we hadn’t even been inside for thirty minutes yet.

‘It’ll be over soon’ I told myself. ‘Nothing’s really happened yet—it’s just a house.’

I had just managed to decrease my heartrate slightly when, from the direction Freddy had gone, I heard a loud thud, and something drop to the ground.

Freddy yelped in pain, “Ah! Son of a bitch!”

James and I both darted from Kate’s room and saw light coming from the one next to it. We found Freddy inside rubbing the ankle that he’d clearly just whacked against a small table he hadn’t noticed—he’d dropped his flashlight when he’d done so, and it’d rolled under the bed.

While Freddy continued to spout expletives, I quickly scanned the room, and realized that it was likely Julia’s—the walls were painted what had once been a very vibrant pink, and it had a different quality to it than the rest of the house. A quality of youth and life—I couldn’t explain it, but it made it all the more eerie.

“Fuck that hurt—grab my light, would ya?” Freddy indicated to me as I was the closest, and I leaned my head down under the bedframe to retrieve it.

And then I saw something odd.

The front of the flashlight was sagging into the floor—the weight of it had dropped one end of a floorboard down ever so slightly, and picked up the other side.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I slipped a couple fingers under the raised edge of the board to find that it was loose. I pulled it up to reveal a small cavity that looked like it was hiding several items.

“Guys, I think I might have found something.” I told the others.

Reaching into the opening, I pulled out a very old pack of cigarettes—maybe Julia had a rebellious side as well—a box of matches, and lastly, a small, very old, and very weathered book.

The cigarettes and the matches made sense, and seemed normal enough for a young teenager to hide beneath a floorboard. But the book. There was something strange about the book… The instant I touched it, I’d felt nauseated and my natural instinct was to throw it as far away from me as I could.

I passed the items back to James and Freddy as I removed them from the hole, feeling better the instant that Freddy took the book from me.

“The fuck is this?” Freddy considered its black, leather cover as I handed him back his flashlight to inspect it closer.

He flipped it open to the first page, and found, sandwiched inside, a folded sheet of notebook paper.

Placing the book down on the bedside table, he unfolded the sheet and read the first line.

“Holy shit…” I heard his breaths coming more quickly.

“Well…” I inquired, “What does it say?”

Freddy recited it aloud to us…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Mom and Dad,*

*Don’t read this journal. You will die.*

*Kate showed it to me the day before they caught her and her friends performing that ritual. She’d bought it at a pawn shop because the owner said it was cursed and she was planning to show it to her friends, but I guess she never got the chance before she was suspended.*

*I found it in hidden beneath some clothes in her dresser the day after she died—I’m sorry I never told you. I was looking for answers; I wanted to an explanation.*

*Well…I found one...*

*I read this, thinking that maybe she’d used it to write her “final note,” but…*

*I was wrong.*

*She hadn’t written in it, but someone else had—someone else had a very long time ago.*

*And, I think he killed her.*

*It’s too late for me—I’ve been hearing things at night—he’s getting closer. I’ve tried to get rid of it several times already. Tried burning it, burying it, throwing it out the bus window—it just keeps coming back.*

*I don’t think I can stop him.*

*I’m so sorry that I didn’t tell you, but I was afraid that if I did, you’d read it—just to try and prove me wrong.*

*I’m hiding this in the hopes that you never find it, but, if you should, please...please just believe me and NEVER read this journal—I don’t want him to take you too.*

*We didn’t kill ourselves.*

*He did.*

*I love you—Kate loved you too.*

*Julia*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Fuck me…” I needed to wipe a tear from my eye as Freddy finished.

“You think it’s real?” James asked—he looked skeptical.

Freddy picked the book back up from the bedside table and studied it more closely.

“Nah… No way! People have been coming here for over twenty years, you really think no one’s ever found that hiding spot before? No, I bet you those same fuckers that hung the noose over in Kate’s room left this here to mess with people. C’mon, a cursed journal?” He was chuckling slightly as he finished—working his hardest to convince himself.

“Here…” He opened back to the first page and read off…

*Property of Archibald Wiggins.*

“Archibald Wiggins?!” James burst out laughing.  “Yea, I think I’m with you—no way that’s a real name. Jesus, they had me going there for a minute with that note.”

However, I didn’t share either of their conviction that it was all just a joke. “I dunno guys, that spot was pretty well hidden, and—I kinda felt something when I touched that thing…like kinda sick…”

Freddy cracked up again, “Dude, it’s a book—you’re really scared of it?” He thumbed through the pages. “Whoever wrote this is just a wannabe horror writer—it’s nothing but a bunch of graphic descriptions of murders from the 1870s…and…holy crap, listen to this—on the last page.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*I, Archibald Wiggins, am the Devil’s servant.*

*The law is closing in—they found the bodies. What sorrow that my wicked life be cut short before I could take more with me. Unfortunately, I shall be swinging at the end of a noose before the week is out.*

*But my work will carry on. Seven have already met their fate at my hands, and though I will soon be removed me from my Earthly body, I will never stop. For upon these words, I place a curse. Whomever shall read them, will share my fate.*

*Veniam ad te*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Bullshit.” James grabbed the journal from Freddy’s hands and read the page himself—his face broke into an incredulous smirk as he finished it. “Ooo, real scary.” He joked. “The hell is ‘Veniam ad te’? That Latin?” He tried to hand the journal to me “Eric, check this out.”

But I refused—I didn’t care that they were going to make fun of me. There was something wrong with it—something…malignant. I didn’t want to ever touch it again.

“Keep that thing away from me!” I said forcefully.

“Aight, whatever dude.” James tried to laugh off my cowardice, but I caught the slightest hint of apprehension on his face as he handed it back to Freddy. I wondered if he felt some of the darkness that I had when he was holding the journal and was now somewhat regretting his choice to read it.

“I gotta show this to Heather—I was just gonna have one of you take a picture of me in here as proof, but this is way better. Come on, I won’t make you guys stay the full two hours now that we’ve got this. We’re not gonna see any ghosts anyways—unless Archibald shows up.” Freddy made fake ghost noises, taunting me, while he folded up Julia’s note and stuck it back inside the journal.

He and James started towards the door, cackling about Archibald coming to get us when suddenly, they both froze.

“Did you hear that?” James was on high-alert.

“Hear what?” I replied—the air was still oppressively quiet around me.

“The whistling.” Said Freddy.

“Alright, I get it guys, I’m a bitch for not reading the journal—how long are you gonna mess with me?” My hair stood on end—I was willing myself to believe they were just screwing around, but I had no idea how they’d coordinated it so quickly and perfectly without me seeing.

“Shhh” James implored.

We all stood dead-still for a minute before Freddy said, “Must have a been a bird up in the attic or something…” But he didn’t sound totally convinced.

James agreed with him. “Yea…yea…probably. Let’s get out of there though…”

We quickly made our way back downstairs and out through the mudroom. Once I was back in the cold night air, the knot that’d twisted itself tighter in my stomach each minute that we’d remained inside began to loosen. I started to feel a little silly about having been so terrified of a book, that, to James and Freddy’s points, had likely just been planted to scare people. But all the same, I had no intention of ever reading it.

We parted ways after exiting the woods, and went back to our respective homes—all proud of ourselves for having survived our “hanging night,” and with Freddy excited to see Heather the following day.

\*\*\*\*

But, the next day at school, neither Freddy or James looked as triumphant as the night before. Both had large bags under their eyes, and were slightly…twitchy. They were talking to each other in low whispers by Freddy’s locker when I approached.

“Jesus, you guys look like shit—you stay up all night gaming again?” I tried to remain optimistic, but my heart had sunk the minute I saw them. Something was wrong, and I already knew it had nothing to do with video games.

“No…um…did you…did you hear anything last night, after you got home?” James was shuddering—his expression ran ice through my veins.

“Nothing out of the ordinary—I fell asleep pretty much right when I got back though and was out until my alarms went off this morning—you okay?” I wanted to be comforting, but the knot in my stomach had returned.

Freddy’s eyes darted back and forth from one end of the hallway to the other, like he was expecting something out of place to appear at any moment.

James began again, “I just…didn’t get much sleep… Every time that I was about to doze off, there was this…this whistling. It’s a song, but I don’t recognize it—I swear it was exactly what I heard when we were leaving the Andersons.”

Freddy slowly nodded—it was clear he’d had the same night that James had. “We shouldn’t have read that journal…” He said in a low, shaking voice—leaning back against his locker to support himself—all the while, his eyes kept shifting up and down the corridor.

I waited for one of them to crack a smile—for Freddy to punch my shoulder like he always did when we were joking around—but their faces remained unchanged.

“Guys, look, I know I wouldn’t read it last night, but I dunno—I’m sure it’s not *actually* cursed… We probably all just got really worked up by that note, and you both said yourselves that it was likely a prank. What you’re hearing is probably in your heads.”

My mouth formed the words, but my brain didn’t fully trust them—nothing in the note or the journal had said anything about whistling…

\*\*\*\*

James and Freddy never logged on that night for our usual evening gaming session, and were worse at school the following day. Again, neither of them got any sleep, and again they’d heard the whistling. But they looked more terrified than before. Freddy could barely talk and James couldn’t stop fidgeting.

“He’s getting closer.” James explained. “I didn’t just hear him last night…I saw him… There was a presence in my room—a darkness behind me. I rolled over to check and at first, I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. But then…a shadow…shifted in the corner. It looked like… Oh, Jesus…” He trailed off.

“Do you know what ‘Veniam ad te’ means?” He asked.

“No…the first time I heard it was the other night…” I couldn’t even feign that what they were experiencing might not be real anymore—they were both so genuinely frightened.

“I looked it up…it’s something like, ‘I will come to you’.” James paused.

“Eric…I think we fucked up. I don’t think Julia’s note was fake… I…I think he’s coming for us.” Tears were welling in his eyes.

Freddy had begun hyperventilating while James was talking—I turned to him and asked, “Do you still have the journal?”

He gave a sideways glance at his backpack on the floor.

“You have it here with you?!” I was shocked that he was carrying the source of his torment around with him.

He blurted out in a pained whisper, “Well I can’t leave it at home! What if one of my parents reads it—or my little brother?! You don’t understand—he’s not coming for you! I even broke up with Heather because I don’t want her with ten feet of this thing—thank God I didn’t go see her on my way home from the Andersons…” He put his face down into his hands.

“Okay, well we’ll get rid of it, or destroy it—burn it or something.” Even as I said it, I remembered Julia’s words.

“Don’t you think I’ve tried! You heard what Julia wrote too, yet I tried anyway—but she was right. Burning it, tearing it up, throwing it in a lake, burying it—it always comes back!”

Now I understood why Freddy’s eyes were constantly searching.

James was looking defeated, but I wasn’t ready to give up. “Maybe we can take it to Father McKay? Maybe he can do a ceremony on it or something—break the attachment that it has to Archibald.”

“He knows our families—what if he doesn’t believe us—what if he tells our parents and they take the journal and read it?” James was right—all of our families attended the same church. “I don’t know how much time we have either—he was so close last night…”

My mind was reeling, trying to think of something that we could do. “Fuck—okay, okay…tonight. Tonight, you guys can stay at my house—my parents are going to a play in the city and won’t be back until the morning.

“I’ll look up some stuff on how to cleanse cursed objects and we’ll deal with this thing ourselves. We’ll campout in the backyard like we used to—there’s no trees and it’s a couple hundred yards from the woods—nothing to hang from. I’ll stay up all night with you guys and we’ll get rid of him somehow.”

We were foolish boys.

\*\*\*\*

That night, I pitched a tent in the backyard and printed off every invocation, chant, ceremony, and ritual I could find that said it would help us destroy the journal. Many of them involved holy water, bibles, rosaries—various holy objects. Luckily, between the three of us, we were able to gather up all the materials we’d need to conduct the blessings by taking items our religious parents had stored around our houses.

James and Freddy arrived around 6pm, and as we were making our way to the backyard, James pulled me aside—telling Freddy to continue to the tent and start setting up.

“Look—I appreciate what you’re trying to do, but I’m not sure this is going to work…”

I tried to reassure him. “James, it’s going to…”

But he cut me off. “Just listen to me for a minute. We can feel him, and he’s near—I can’t explain it, but we know that he’ll reach us tonight. If this doesn’t work, and he…comes for us… You can never tell our families the truth. Do you understand?  Freddy and I have agreed and have written notes explaining that we’ve been depressed for a long time and planned to do ‘it’ together—that you had no idea…”

He stopped for a moment—I could tell this speech was rehearsed—that he was doing his best to hold it together, but he was convulsing.

Collecting himself, he continued, “We can’t risk anyone ever reading that thing again. If we die, you’ll have to hold onto it—keep it away from everyone. Forever. Please, Eric, swear that you’ll do this.”

“James I…”

“Swear!”

“Okay, okay. I swear.”

“Thank you.”

He looked the slightest bit relieved, and we made our way outside to join Freddy.

Inside the tent, by candlelight, we began shortly after dark—throwing everything we had at it. Dousing it in holy water, holding rosaries, chanting bible verses—James and Freddy were desperate in their fevered attempts to kill the thing that had been stalking them for days. And for a time, we thought it might be working. Neither of them heard the whistling, and the presence they’d felt seemed to be moving farther away.

I even saw Freddy crack a smile for the first time in two days.

But then, sometime after midnight, they both froze again—just like they had on our “hanging night”.

“No…” Freddy whimpered.

Both of their heads swung around and fixated on the back wall of the tent—then, they followed something moving around us towards the entrance.

“Oh God, no…”

My heart was in my throat—I wanted to reach out and hold onto them, but I was suddenly overcome with exhaustion. Blackness pressed in on my vision and I collapsed to the ground—the last thing I heard was the zipper opening, and the screams of my best friends before I passed out.

\*\*\*\*

The tent was empty when I awoke in the dawn sunlight on the 13th, but I didn’t need to go far to find my missing friends.

When I poked my head outside, I saw James and Freddy swinging in the early-morning breeze.

Two trees, side-by-side, right at the edge of the woods that we’d thought were too far away.

\*\*\*\*

I kept my promise to James and never told his or Freddy’s family the truth—the notes they’d written were convincing, and both of their deaths were designated as suicides.

And too, I’ve held on to the journal ever since—it sits in a locked in a safe in my bedroom. While I’ve never read it, Archibald’s curse has been burned in my memory ever since that night at the Anderson house.

Over the years, I’ve considered different ways of getting rid of it, but all of them come with an inherent risk of someone reading it if I was unsuccessful, and I don’t want to give Archibald the satisfaction of taking another life.

For a while, I tried to research him—to see if maybe I could find his remains and destroy those—wondering if maybe that would break his curse. But I can’t find anything about a murderous Archibald Wiggins from the 1870s—they didn’t keep the best records back then.

So, the simplest solution, I thought, was that the journal would just stay with me. I wrapped it in plastic a long time ago because I have a theory that it stays with whoever touched the cover last—it’s why it’s never left me, and why it never left the Anderson home until Freddy took it. And, my will stipulates that I be buried with it.

I’d hoped that that would be enough to put an end to it all.

But I think he’s getting annoyed with having been hidden away for so long—contained by a life that he can’t take; I might need to try something different soon.

Because recently, at night, I swear I’ve heard a muted whistling.
