Let me begin by saying… this wasn’t my idea…

My stupid ex-boyfriend, James, decided to surprise me with this trip.

At first, I thought it was cute. Yes. He’d been a shitty boyfriend. But a free trip to Disneyland? 

I couldn’t pass that up. 

Disneyland is the happiest place on earth. 

James even had me invite my best friend, Avery, which was nice.

We all met at the theme park. 

Everything seemed to be going well. Until…

We went on Pirates. 

Understand that Pirates is my favorite ride!! I absolutely love it. I used to go on it all the time with my dad. 

So I was pumped, even if stupid James was riding with us.

We sat down in the third row on our boat.

It shot out from the gateway and into the water. 

MAGIC as always. 

But then, something strange happened. James started acting weird. Like psycho weird.

As soon as the pirates started showing up (you know, after that creepy dip where the voice screams “DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES!), he started mumbling and tugging at his clothes. 

Avery and I looked at each other, “What the fuck?” 

We got to the burning town scene, where all the pirates are partying, and James leapt off the boat and started attacking the animatronics!

He grabbed one of pirates’ heads and ripped it off, screaming: “THIS ISN’T REAL!” 

A kid started crying.

Everyone in the boats was shocked… 

Then… 

All the lights came on… like blinding lights. 

Footsteps started pounding. It was Disney security! 

A skinny guard tackled James.

I stood and shouted: “Chill out before they rip your head off!”

But James wasn’t listening.  

It took another security guard to drag him away toward the edge of the town.

Avery and I panicked: *What do we do?!* 

A guard approached me and asked: “Are you with this guy?” 

I nodded. 

He grabbed my arm. "Ouch!"

“Wait!” Avery started to follow, but he shoved her back.  

The guard dragged me through the burning city…  

... and led me to a metal door, which turned into a long dark tunnel. 

Inside I could hear James scream…

Then… 

… The Guard guided me to another door and tossed me in.

Inside was this metal table with a Disney employee. 

He must’ve been a lawyer or something cause he was dressed nice. 

He stared down at me like I was death, like I was literally the fucking devil. 

“Do you realize what you’ve done?” 

“Please!” I said. “Can I just go?!” 

“Give me your phone!”  

“No.”

“GIVE IT TO ME OR YOU’LL NEVER SEE YOUR FUCKING FRIENDS AGAIN!”

I handed it over. 

He jammed it into his pocket, then said: “Your friend destroyed valuable Disney property.”

“He’s not my friend —“

“THE DEBT MUST BE PAID!”

I tried pleading with him... 

But Mr. Lawyer just laughed and opened the door to leave.

“James!” I shouted. 

But the door closed. Everything went quiet. 

All I could think of was Avery locked in one of these rooms. 

Poor Avery… She didn’t even want to come. 

The only good thing is those stupid fucks forgot to get my second phone. 

That’s right!

I carry two because my sister lets me borrow hers to take nice pictures.

But there’s literally no reception down here. 

All I can do is write this email and hope that someone finds it as soon as I get a signal. 

It’s been twelve hours and I haven’t seen or heard any signs of Avery or James. 

I’m so scared…

If you’re somehow reading this, please reach out to my dad, Hector Gonzales. He works for Anaheim as a city planner.

Please hurry...
