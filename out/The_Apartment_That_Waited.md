When I first moved into my new apartment, I honestly thought I’d hit the jackpot. It was cheap, in a quiet neighborhood, and close to work. The building was old, yeah, but it had that vintage charm—creaky wooden floors, brass doorknobs, the kind of place that felt like it had stories to tell. The elevator was slow and groaned like it hated its job, but I didn’t care. I was just happy to finally have a place to myself.

The first night, though, something felt… off. The air inside was heavy, almost damp, even with the windows open. It felt like the apartment didn’t want the outside air coming in. I brushed it off—moving stress, I told myself—and went to bed. Around midnight, I woke up to footsteps above me. Slow, steady steps. Except… I was on the top floor. No one lived above me.

I tried to rationalize it—old buildings make noises, pipes shift, wood expands—but deep down, I knew it was different. There was a rhythm to those footsteps. Like someone was pacing. I stayed in bed, covers pulled up to my chin, and eventually fell asleep, but I woke up uneasy the next morning.

Over the next few days, little things started happening. The bathroom light flickered every time I walked in, even after I replaced the bulb. The hallway mirror—God, this one still makes my skin crawl—would sometimes lag. Like, I’d move, and my reflection would take a split second to catch up. And once, as I was leaving for work, I swear I heard someone whisper my name from the stairwell. It was soft, almost playful. But when I turned around, the stairwell was empty.

By the third night, the footsteps came back, louder this time, and there was humming. A soft, low lullaby that made my stomach drop. I sat up in bed, frozen, just staring at the ceiling, listening until it faded away with the sunrise.

A couple of days later, I finally met my neighbor across the hall, an old woman named Mrs. Greene. She seemed nervous when I introduced myself. She didn’t even smile, just looked at me with these tired eyes and grabbed my arm. Her grip was surprisingly strong. “Keep your doors locked at night,” she said, her voice shaking. “All of them. Even the ones inside.” Then she just turned and went back inside, leaving me standing there like an idiot, trying to laugh it off.

That night, I made sure to lock everything. Front door, bedroom, even the closet. Around 3 a.m., I woke up to the sound of a door creaking open. I sat up, my heart pounding, and saw that my closet door—locked—was open. Just a sliver. Dark as hell inside, like the kind of darkness that eats up light. Then I heard it. That same humming, soft and deliberate, like it was coming from the closet. I couldn’t move. It felt like the room itself was holding me down. I just sat there, frozen, until the sun came up and the door slowly… closed.

The next morning, I didn’t go to work. I turned on every light in the apartment and sat on the edge of my bed, shaking. When I finally worked up the courage to check the bedroom door, there were scratch marks on the inside. Long, thin lines running top to bottom, like someone dragged their nails across the wood. They hadn’t been there before.

I called my landlord, desperate for some explanation. He just sighed and said, “That place has… history,” and hung up.

After that, Mrs. Greene wouldn’t talk to me. She wouldn’t even open her door when I knocked. One time, though, I caught her peeking through the chain. She looked terrified. “It likes attention,” she whispered. “Don’t listen when it calls you.” And then the door slammed shut.

By the end of the week, I wasn’t sleeping. Every time I closed my eyes, I’d wake up somewhere else. Once in the kitchen, once sitting in the hallway with the front door wide open, and once—this one still haunts me—standing in front of the mirror, my reflection grinning while my face stayed blank.

I set up my phone to record one night, just to prove to myself that I was imagining things. The next morning, I played the video. Hours of silence, then, right before it cut off, this low, guttural whisper: “Stay.”

That was it for me. I packed everything in a frenzy the next day. I didn’t care about sorting or organizing—I just wanted out. As I dragged the last box toward the door, the whole apartment… changed. The walls groaned, every light flickered, and then—bang—every door in the place slammed shut at the same time. The air went freezing cold. I could see my breath. And then I heard it. My voice. From somewhere inside the apartment. Calling my name. Over and over.

It got closer. Louder. Twisted. “You can’t leave,” it whispered, right behind my ear. “You’re mine now.”

I don’t remember unlocking the front door. I don’t remember running barefoot down the stairwell, screaming. The next thing I knew, I was standing in the street, shaking, the city sounds wrapping around me like a blanket.

I never went back. I left everything—furniture, clothes, even my phone—and checked into a motel across town. Eventually, I found a new place. New building. New neighborhood. No history. But sometimes, late at night, when it’s quiet and I’m alone, I hear that humming again. Soft, patient. Like it’s just waiting for me to come home.
