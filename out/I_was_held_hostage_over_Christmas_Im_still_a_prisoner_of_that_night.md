I stopped believing in hope when a jiggly, greasy Santa Claus leaned in front of the popped eyeball goop dripping down my face, his lumpy erection bumping against the two remaining gifts, as the barbecue smell wafted from my friend’s sizzling corpse while it melted onto my thighs. The stranger I only knew as “brunette college girl” sobbed quietly and shook her head, unable to articulate her pain and horror within the confines of the English language. 

“[I said that it was *your turn*](https://redd.it/10bpzvo),” Dirty Santa grunted. He ground his teeth back and forth. It sounded like an ungreased axle scraping the paint off a car’s hood.

‘Please don’t,’ she mouthed without sound.

“Did you know that I can cut pieces of your face off, then stitch them back in the wrong spots?” Santa reached for his sphincter and smiled. “Even if you make that course of action a necessity, you’ll still have to choose a gift afterward.”

She shook her head, tears streaming and snot jiggling, as she reached a trembling hand for a red bag with a festive red bow.

Santa licked his lips. Dry skin snowed down like dandruff.

I silently begged her not to pick the red bag.

She hesitated.

And then she picked the red bag.

The young woman reached in and extracted a trembling hand, holding a pistol with a tag attached to it. It was a bizarre juxtaposition; she was short and slight, clutching a weapon that was clearly designed for a much larger person. Her eyes were wide, and she was too afraid to let go of what she held. 

The blonde woman next to her read the tag aloud:

“You found Santa’s best gift,

you sly little elf!

Pick one person to shoot,

Yes, even yourself!”

The young woman held the gun as far from her face as she possibly could. It looked like she was squeezing a particularly old slice of mayonnaise custard. But she didn’t release it; the weapon stuck to her fingers like an electrical current was keeping her grip shut tight.

“I’d like to switch my gift,” the blonde woman said.

“Hmmmm?” Santa asked, smiling toward her. “But you haven’t even picked yet!”

“Doesn’t matter,” she shot back. “I want hers.”

Santa sniffed his finger before reaching behind himself once more. “Well… why don’t you *take* it, then?”

The younger woman looked at her with pleading eyes. I could have sworn that she just wanted a parent figure in that moment.

“Hand it to me,” the blonde woman said, nodding. “I promise it will be okay.”

The gun shook.

Then the college girl dropped the weapon in the other woman’s extended hand, snapping her arm back as though she’d been burned. 

The blonde woman gave a sad smile. Her younger counterpart leaned back, relief washed over her face. 

The blonde woman turned the pistol at the college girl and shot her. 

Headshots are glamorous in every movie you’ve seen. The hero executes with perfect, clean aim to eliminate someone whom we accept as a ‘bad guy.’ Superfluous characters are rarely considered after their demise, and we never wonder how their mothers react upon hearing that the funeral will need to feature a closed casket.

I had no such luxury. The human head contains no empty space, and when her blood and brains had blown onto the floor, my mind boggled at how it all fit to begin with. 

Her eyes stuck with me the most. They bulged, twitched, and blinked long after brain function had ceased.

“Gorgeous,” Santa breathed. “A sight that would give 19 erections to 13 dandelions.” He was three fingers deep at this point. “But what to do now?” His nostrils flared. “No one is left to choose the final present!” He looked at me with shaky pupils. “Our gift exchange has ended early. Oh well, it was fun!”

Then he turned and skipped – no shitting, he actually *skipped* - toward the only door in the room.

“Wait,” the blonde woman called after him. “If it’s over, can we go home? Can we leave?”

“Oh, I taped Exacto knives and your fully-charged cellphones beneath each of your chairs. They’ve been there the whole time, and you have more than enough slack to reach them even with your hands tied. Isn’t it funny that you could have escaped without hurting yourselves?” 

Then he farted and hopped out the door.

The blonde woman’s face blanched as she froze for just a moment. 

Then she reached under her seat, moving furiously. Five seconds later, she emerged with the knife and cell phone, then began working to free herself. She locked eyes with me, panting.

I hadn’t budged.

Using quick movements, she shredded the twine holding her in place. With that out of the way, she stood, flexed her fingers, and pocketed the phone. Then she took the Exacto knife in her left hand and the pistol in her right, turned around, and advanced on me.

I still hadn’t moved. I was spiritually empty. 

“We’re built to survive,” she whispered. “And secrets are meant to be kept.” She looked down at the weapons she held.

Only then did I understand.

“There’s no good way out of this,” she whispered. “I’m sorry, my friend – but not sorry enough to stop myself.”

My blood ran cold. I knew that there was a knife just below me, and I knew I’d be dead before reaching it. 

I cried out of my remaining eye. 

“I’m sorry,” she whispered once more. “But I just checked, and there’s only one bullet left, which I’ll need to keep for an emergency.” She lifted the knife, her breaths coming in rasps. “I’ll try to minimize your suffering. Now lift your neck and hold very still.”

Obviously, I survived. 

I attribute that to the fact that I’m not a good man. 

I can’t write anymore tonight. No amount of Valium is helping at this point. I hear that huffing bleach can cause brain damage; here’s to hoping that damage comes in the form of erased memories. 

I’ll explain what happened next if I’m able to get up off my bathroom floor.
