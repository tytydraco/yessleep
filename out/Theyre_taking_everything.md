Two months. That’s how long the ink had been dry on our marriage certificate when my wife, Sarah, and I found ourselves in Portugal, the sun-drenched landscape a stark, beautiful contrast to the life we’d known. The honeymoon was her idea – a chance to escape, to breathe. Portugal was a revelation, its rugged coastline and ancient forests were truly a magnificent feat. Walking deep into its wilderness stirred something primal in us, a longing for the untouched, the untamed.

On our third day, under a sky filled with colors unseen before, we met Andre. He was a local, his eyes holding the kind of knowing glint that speaks of generations tied to the land. He told us, his voice low and conspiratorial, about an abandoned warehouse, nestled some five miles into the dense forest. A local legend, he called it. Couples who ventured there, he said, always found one of two things. A ring, symbolising a tranquil, unending union. Or a blank piece of paper, an omen of divorce, of separation.

We laughed it off, of course. Relics of an older, more superstitious time. Of course. Yet, the allure of the adventure, the mystery of it, tugged at us. A shared experience, a story to tell. So, around three in the afternoon, with the sun beginning its slow descent, we set off.

The forest was a living cathedral, sunlight dappling through leaves like stained glass. The deeper we ventured, the more potent its magic became. There was an unnerving stillness to it, an ancient silence that seemed to swallow sound. That unexplained feeling of safety I’d initially felt began to curdle into something less comforting, a sense of being observed by unseen eyes.

After what felt like an eternity, close to two and a half hours of pushing through dense wilderness, a flash of white against the green. A rusty, corrugated chunk of metal, stark and jarring against the organic beauty. "This is it!" Sarah whispered, her voice tight with a mixture of excitement and something I couldn't quite name – perhaps apprehension. Her smile, usually so wide and effortless, seemed a little strained.

The structure loomed, more dilapidated and sinister up close than I’d imagined. We forced open a massive, rusty sliding door, its screech echoing like a tortured animal. A peculiar smell met us – damp earth, decay, and something else, something metallic and faintly sweet, that I still can’t identify. It clung to the back of my throat.

Our phone flashlights cut feeble paths through the gloom, illuminating empty, dust-laden shelves and decaying crates. Then, in a far corner, tucked away on the lowest shelf, I saw it: a small, somewhat inviting red box. I called Sarah over. Together, with a shared glance, we lifted the lid. Disappointment, sharp and immediate. Inside, nestled on faded velvet, lay a crumbling, yellowed piece of paper. "It doesn't mean anything," Sarah said, her voice flat, the earlier excitement extinguished. She turned, already moving towards the light of the open door. I nodded, agreeing outwardly, but a strange compulsion made me linger.

I picked up the paper. It wasn’t blank, as the legend had threatened. A wave of foolish relief washed over me – the superstition was just that. But the relief was a fleeting thing, dissolving into a cold dread as my eyes focused on the messy, looping script. It was Sarah’s handwriting. Unmistakably. And it read: "You Set Me Free."

My blood ran cold. Sarah was with me. She hadn’t been here before. This wasn't some prank. The air in the warehouse suddenly felt heavy, suffocating. I decided, in that instant, not to show her, not to let this taint the rest of our trip. I pocketed the note, the crumbling paper strangely cold against my skin.

Three days later, we were back in New Orleans. The first night in our own bed should have been a comfort. I remember the familiar scent of our linens, the weight of the city settling outside our window. But that was the night the whispers began. Not from somewhere distant. From right beside me. From Sarah. "I'm free," she murmured, her voice a soft, ethereal hiss in the darkness. "I'm free... I'm free." She didn't stop. I tried to wake her, gently at first, then with more urgency, to the point I was shaking here almost violently. Her eyes remained closed, her breathing even, but the words kept spilling out. As I shook her, panic beginning to claw at my throat. No response. I reached for my phone, my fingers fumbling for the emergency number, when a sharp, sickening *snap* echoed from her direction. I turned, phone light wavering, and saw her shoulder contorted at an impossible angle. Another snap, from her elbow this time. Her body began to twitch, to bend in ways that defied anatomy, a grotesque marionette pulled by unseen strings. Before I could scream, before I could even process the horrifying ballet unfolding before my eyes, her distorted form was jerked from the bed. It was dragged, violently, across the floor towards the hallway, a dark stain of blood blossoming on the polished wood beneath her. I scrambled after her, lunging, managing to grasp her hand. Her skin was cold, unnaturally so. I pulled, resisting the invisible force with a strength born of terror and desperate love. It pulled harder. Then, in a nauseating instant, an immense, irresistible force yanked her away. I was left kneeling, clutching her severed arm, blood warm and slick against my palm. The rest of her body receded down the hallway, which seemed to stretch, to elongate into an impossible, swallowing darkness. She faded, and then she was gone. 

The silence that followed was absolute, save for my own ragged, choked breaths and the rhythmic drip of blood from the limb I still held. Her wedding ring glinted. I don’t remember much of the next few hours. Shock is a merciful anaesthetic. Eventually, I placed her arm in the bathtub, covering it with a towel. A futile, insane gesture. I didn’t call the police. What could I say? I must have collapsed from exhaustion, from the sheer weight of the situation.

When I woke, pale morning light was filtering through the bedroom window. The house was eerily silent. The first thing I noticed was the hallway. It was normal. Just a hallway. For a wild, desperate moment, I thought perhaps it had all been a monstrous nightmare. Then I saw the bloodstain on the floor, already drying to a dark, accusatory brown. Her arm… I stumbled to the bathroom. The towel was there. But the arm was gone. A new, deeper chill settled into my bones. I walked through the house like a ghost. It wasn't just her arm. The living room was bare. The sofa, the coffee table, the bookshelves filled with our shared histories – all gone. The kitchen: appliances, utensils, even the magnets from our travels that had adorned the refrigerator – vanished. Every room was a hollow echo of what it had been. Photographs from the walls, clothes from the closets, the very scent of our life together – erased. It wasn’t a burglary. There was no forced entry, no mess, just… absence. A meticulous, supernatural emptying. They were taking everything. My gaze fell upon the small, red box from the warehouse, which I’d inexplicably brought back, now sitting alone on the dusty patch where our dresser used to be. Inside, the note. *“You Set Me Free.”* My trembling fingers traced the messy script, then moved lower. There it was, fainter this time, almost invisible, scratched beneath her words. *“Andre.”* A name that now tasted like ash in my mouth. A clue to a horror I couldn't comprehend, let alone fight.

I don’t know what will be taken when I wake up again, but I feel like I have nothing more to lose. Everything is already gone - my wife, my home, my sanity. They're taking everything.
