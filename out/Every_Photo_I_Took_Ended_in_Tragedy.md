It was the early 2010s when I found my father’s camera. A relic from another era; one of his countless forgotten things confined to the attic after his passing.

In life, he had this... obsession with it. Not like someone obsessed with photography, but something deeper, stranger. It was like the camera had consumed him, his hands bound to it as if it were one with his flesh, and in most of my memories of him, his face is hidden behind it. He existed only beyond its lens like the world didn’t matter unless he was seeing it through that damned viewfinder.

Rediscovering the camera felt like a chance to reconnect with him after all of these years. I was seventeen at the time, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little excited to find it. It was an old QuickTake 100, clunky and covered in dust. The thing looked ancient, by tech standards, and holding it, it felt... heavy. Not just in weight, but in something else. Almost like I could feel my dad’s attachment to it, his love for it tangible in plastic and metal. And for a moment, I thought maybe I could see what he saw. Maybe I could understand why it seemed to matter more than we did.

This was his totem - his artistic lifeline - and perhaps knowing this I should’ve left it undisturbed.

I should’ve left it there, buried beneath old furniture and junk.

But I didn’t.

The first incident - it all happened so fast. I had just wiped the dust off the lens, standing by my bedroom window. My best friend, Charlie, he lived across the street, and I remember seeing him in his room, just a blur of motion through the glass. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the neighbourhood, and it seemed like a good time to test the camera, to see if it even worked after all these years. And so, I lifted the viewfinder to my eye, lining up the shot, and pressed the button on its side.

The flash went off, bright and glaring.

And then - chaos.

A deafening *boom* rocked the air, shaking my house as if we were caught in an earthquake. I stumbled back to my bed, hands covering my face as a burst of radiant life seared through my window. My heart raced as I tried to make sense of what had just happened. I smelled smoke - it assaulted my nostrils almost instantly - and the scent of burning wood; it was strong. So I pushed myself off my bed, staggering over to the window, and that’s when I saw it.

Charlie’s house... was gone.

Where his house once stood was nothing but a hellish crater, flames licking up into the sky. The remains of his home were scattered in all directions, as if something had reached down from the heavens and ripped it apart. The noise, the smoke, the screams... they were everywhere. My mom rushed outside - I heard the door hit the wall as she tore it open - pulling my sister with her, both of them in hysterics.

But I couldn’t move.

I just stood there, staring at the chaos, paralysed by the shock of what I’d just witnessed. I remained frozen until the fire engines arrived, beginning their futile attempt to quell the inferno, but God, how it burned. 

It burned and it burned and it burned, the flames raging on into the night, glowing like a second sun in the darkness. Charlie and his family... incinerated in an instant. Gone, just like that; wiped off the face of the earth. They never stood a chance.

A few weeks later, the official report blamed it on a gas leak. And I believed it at first - I had to. What else could explain something so sudden, so violent?

But I was naive. I had no idea at the time - it was just a freak accident. I had just happened to capture it.

A year or so later, I found the camera again. It was like it reappeared in my bedroom. Hidden in plain sight amongst the clutter, I rediscovered it whilst packing up for university - I was moving far from home - and I plugged it into the family computer, hoping to find some of my father’s old photos. These cameras, apparently they can only hold about 8 photographs at a time, so I was curious to see if he’d left a few on there before his passing. But he hadn’t; I discovered that quickly. The curious smile on my face fell into a frown.

But there was one photo on there; a singular file in its memory.

Just one horrifying photograph that made my heart stop. I opened it up, the image exploding onto my screen, and tears rolled over my cheeks.

In the image, the house had been caught mid-explosion, walls buckling, windows shattering, fire erupting from the ground. I’d captured the exact moment the house was obliterated. And something about it... felt wrong. Like it wasn’t just a coincidence. Like I had *caused* it, somehow, with the flick of my finger, the button akin to the trigger of a gun.

Terrified, I deleted the photo. I didn’t think, I just wanted it gone; away from my tear-filled eyes. But even after it was wiped, that feeling stayed. This nagging sense that the camera was more than just a piece of equipment. That it held onto things... dark things. My father had been obsessed with it for a reason.

So I didn’t touch the camera again for a while.

But, like a cursed object from an old horror movie, I couldn’t shake its presence. When I left home one year for my final term of university, I brought it with me; I don’t even know why. It just... ended up in my bag, like it *wanted* to come along, and for months, it sat on a shelf in my dorm room, collecting dust. It stared at me from its spot, its lens like an unblinking eye, and sometimes I felt like my father was watching me through it. I swear I could see his eye in the lens from time to time, but I knew I was just being paranoid; perhaps I'd had one too many coffees during a late-night study. So I left it alone. I let it - *him* - watch over me undisturbed.

Until one day, I couldn’t.

It was late and I was stressed out from a final project; it was going to be making up most of my grade. I needed a distraction, so I grabbed the camera, telling myself it was harmless. I stood in front of my mirror, holding it up to my face, and for a second, I considered taking a picture of myself. My finger hovered over the button, a smile blooming on my face, but something stopped me. I felt... dread. A cold wave of fear washed over me, and I remembered the explosion. The fire. Charlie.

I put the camera down. I relived the explosion all over again, and for a while, I was frozen to the spot.

But then the next day, I took it with me to campus.

I can’t tell you why, but I just felt like I needed to. My friend Sarah and I were hanging out by a smoking shelter with a few other students. They were fascinated by the old camera, calling it a piece of history. They begged me to take a photo of them, Sarah and these three other girls I didn't know, but I was hesitant; I was shaking at just the thought of it. Every instinct screamed at me to stop, but they kept urging me on.

So I agreed to it, against my better judgment.

I stood up, and they moved into place behind a row of bollards, posing and pouting; it was by no means a serious photograph. Lifting the viewfinder to my eye, I struggled to still the shot, my hands still shaking with anxiety, but I calmed myself, slowing my breathing; I thought I was simply scaring myself. What happened to Charlie, that was a freak accident. There was no way this camera had any part in its doing.

And so I pressed the button; I pulled the trigger. And what happened next, it was all on me.

The flash went off. The world transformed into white light and my eyes burned as if I had stared into the sun.

But screaming followed.

I heard bodies hitting metal, then the sound of flesh pounding the ground, bones breaking upon impact. The gargled sound of blood pooling in someone's throat. The continuous, monotonous beep of a car horn.

It came out of nowhere, swerving wildly down the road. I’d heard it coming, but I never foresaw this happening. The driver, a drunk student, had lost control of the wheel. The girls were thrown into the air like ragdolls, killed the moment their skin touched the bumper, but I had witnessed none of it. I’d held my eyes shut after the flash as if I knew what was coming, and instantly I regretted not trusting my gut. I *knew* this was going to happen. I just knew something would happen; I could *feel* it.

But now they were dead. All three of them. Dead. And so too was the driver, his car wrapped around a concrete pillar, his skull crushed against the horn, the sound wailing like a scream.

And I was numb. It felt like a nightmare I couldn’t wake up from. The deaths. The destruction. The two times I used this camera, death had followed. And it wasn’t a coincidence; I was certain of that. It wasn’t just bad luck.

This camera *was* the cause; the murderer, the executioner. It killed. I don’t know how else to put it, and I know it sounds ridiculous, but if you held it in your hands, you would feel it too.

It was more than plastic and metal, this camera. It was satanic. It was hellish. It was under the influence of evil; possessed or hexed. And I should’ve destroyed it before it took another life, but for some reason - perhaps it was its power - I simply couldn’t.

That summer, I left the camera on my desk, untouched, as if ignoring it could somehow undo the damage. But it was still there, watching me. Waiting. Waiting for the day I’d pick it up again, once I convinced myself that everything was just a coincidence.

That day came when winter rolled around. Enough time had passed for the fear to dull, for the memories to blur. The idea that the camera was responsible for those deaths, it seemed ridiculous. Something I’d imagined in the chaos and grief.

Until one night, a sick curiosity crept in.

It was late - around 3 a.m. - when I gave in to the urge. My laptop was glowing in the dark, the cursor hovering over the camera’s file. I’d grown fascinated with death over the summer, consuming gore videos online, each one more gruesome than the last. I told myself it was to desensitize, to numb the horror that I had witnessed, but really, I was sinking deeper into something I didn’t want to understand.

I wasn’t proud of it, but I *needed* to see that photo. The one I took right before the girls died, before their souls were ripped from their bodies. I wanted to stare death in the face. To see the exact moment their lives ended, captured in stillness. And in a way, it felt like I had created my own personal snuff film; this photo could rise above what I had seen online.

You probably think I’m disgusting for saying that, and you’d be right; I know it myself.

And there it was; the singular photo file. It stared back at me through the screen, taunting me, daring me to open it. And so I did. I clicked - I indulged - and opened it to full screen.

I gasped.

The car mid-crash, the girls suspended in the air like broken marionettes. The first two were twisted grotesquely, limbs bent at impossible angles, skin tearing as they were ripped apart from the force. Their heads were snapped back, throats extended unnaturally; the moment of their deaths frozen forever. The third girl... she hadn’t yet hit the car, but the bumper was inches from her, and in that split second, she’d turned her head. She was looking right at it, right at her death. And it was devastating; I could see the fear in her eyes.

But what made my stomach twist... was Sarah.

She was perfectly fine. Still standing, hands in her pockets, staring straight at the camera. At *me*. It was nothing was happening around her. She wasn’t part of the chaos, wasn’t caught in the carnage. She was just... there. Smiling, ready for her picture.

But her eyes - God, her eyes. They burned through the screen, locked onto mine. I could feel her *seeing* me like she wasn’t just a figure in a photograph. As if, even in death, she was still looking at me, still waiting for me to press that button again, to ignite the camera flash.

My breath caught in my throat. My skin crawled. I slammed the laptop shut, yanking the camera cable out, nearly ripping it apart. My heart pounded as I stumbled out of bed, needing air, needing to get away from that photo. I rushed to the window, sucking in deep breaths as I leaned against the cold glass, and stared out at the street.

The house across the road was an empty lot now - it hadn't changed in years. It was a patch of blackened earth, the damage like a scar on the land's flesh. A remnant of the horror that had occurred. Just looking at it made my chest tighten, my nose tingling with the phantom smell of smoke. I couldn’t escape the memory of that fire, the flames licking up into the sky, the heat against my skin.

And in that moment, I made a decision.

I had to get rid of the camera.

Once might have been a freak accident. Twice could still be a coincidence. But three times? If something happened again, if another life was lost, there would be no more pretending. No more comforting myself with lies.

If I took one more photo, and someone else died... what would that mean? That the camera was truly cursed? That it held some evil, some power I couldn’t understand?

And what about my father? How did he fit into all of this? What had he seen through its lens?

No. I couldn’t think about that. I didn’t *want* to. The camera had to go. It was better off gone. But I struggled to let it go.

For days, the camera sat there, untouched, perched on the edge of my desk, waiting. Every time I went to throw it away, I hesitated. I couldn’t explain the power it had over me - it felt like it was *fighting* for its survival. So, it stayed there for weeks, teetering dangerously close to the edge, until one evening, after spiralling once again into another binge of gore videos, I finally built up the courage to let it go.

That last video - another gruesome car crash - pushed me over the edge. It was too much. The blood, the twisted wreckage. It brought back the sound of the screams, the thud of bodies against the pavement, the horror of the police cordon that haunted me when I left campus early, unable to finish the term.

I had to get rid of it, before it took another life, and I had to do it now.

But when I reached for the camera, it was gone.

Panic gripped me. My chest tightened, my heart racing as I began to tear apart my room. The camera had to be here - it *had* to be. I couldn’t risk it ending up in someone else’s hands. I ripped through drawers, threw clothes on the floor, overturned my bed, but the camera had simply vanished.

And I knew - *someone* had taken it.

I was a fool to leave it on my desk for the taking.

I bolted down the stairs, my legs shaking beneath me, startling my mother as I burst into the living room. She looked up from her glass of wine, alarmed by the terror on my face. I stammered, demanding to know if she’d seen it - the camera, the one my father had cherished. Maybe she’d put it back in the attic, where it belonged.

But no. Of course not.

Her answer knocked the breath from me, my stomach lurching.

‘It’s with your sister,’ she said, so casually. So innocently. She had no idea the weight of those words, no idea of the danger. I felt the blood drain from my face, bile rising in my throat as I begged her - where was she? Where was my sister?

Her next words were worse.

‘She’s at Sienna’s house. Just down the road. They’re having a party.’

My world collapsed. I gasped, my lungs squeezing tight as if all the air had been sucked out of the room. A cold finger of dread traced its way down my spine.

I didn’t think - I just ran.

I tore through the front door with such force it slammed against the wall, my mother calling after me, but I couldn’t stop. The night air was freezing, my breath visible in front of me as I sprinted down the street, each step heavier than the last. My lungs burned like fire, but I kept going, screaming her name into the darkness, a sense of dread building with every stride. That awful feeling - like every time before the deaths - it came back to me. The weight of impending doom settled in my gut.

I could see the house now, just up ahead. My legs were shaking, cramping with pain, but I pushed through it, my heart thundering in my ears. I *had* to get there. I *had* to save her; save everyone from the damned camera!

But I was too late.

Just seconds too late, my feet barely scraping the lawn.

The sound of shattering glass pierced the night. Then came the flames. They burst outwards, consuming the house in an instant, searing my skin as I was thrown backwards by the force of the explosion. My head hit the ground, the world spinning as I struggled to focus through blurry vision. I could barely make out people running from the blaze, their bodies engulfed in flames, their clothes igniting, their flesh melting.

And all I could do was sob.

I had let this happen. I had let the camera be taken, let it fall into the hands of someone who had no idea what it was capable of. And now my sister - *my sister* - was in there, turning to ash in the centre of the inferno.

She didn’t know. She had no way of knowing.

But I should have gotten there sooner.

This fire too, after a long investigation, was ruled as another gas leak - the second on our street. Another tragic accident, they said, but I knew better. It wasn’t gas, nor was it an accident.

It was *the camera*.

They recovered my sister’s body, but it was burned beyond recognition, along with twenty-four other partygoers. My mother was devastated - the whole street mourned again - but I knew it was my fault. I had let this happen. I had let it take another life - *many* more lives.

And though the camera was destroyed in the blaze - reduced to nothing but ash along with my sister - at least I can live knowing it won’t harm anyone else. But it came at a cost. It tore away a piece of my heart, and my mother, she was never the same after that day. How could she be; she'd lost everything. She barely even existed to me after my sister died - she was mourning eternally. It's all she could do. She floated through life as if she was already dead, so her passing a few years later felt like mercy. She was suffering in life - she was hardly alive - but at least she's at rest now.

That leaves only me.

But the camera, at least it's gone forever now. But the guilt? The guilt will never leave me. And some nights, I lie awake, staring at the ceiling, wondering if it’s all truly over. If it really died in those flames; are flames enough to extinguish such evil? But other nights... I wonder if it's simply waiting for someone else to find it so its flash can play the executioner once again.
