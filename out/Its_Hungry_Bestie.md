There she is, my best friend - smeared along the pavement.

I knew this would happen. I did everything to stop it.

I looked in that cursed mirror - sacrificed my sanity - and for what?

A dead best friend… and I’m next.

We had just moved in for college and were furnishing our apartment with bargain finds - so we went to the flea market.

That’s where we found the mirror.

A full body, dazzling silver frame embroidered with sapphires.

It was stunning, and dirt cheap.

The man who sold it to us appeared skittish, and as soon as I bought it off him, he vanished.

We placed it in the living room of our apartment as somewhat of a center piece - framed perfectly against the far wall.

Nothing was strange, at first. Then, one day we saw the man who sold us the mirror on the news.

Dead… by a shotgun blast through his head - suicide.

That night, that was when it began.

I went out for a glass of water and thought I heard people talking.

Whispers emanated from the mirror, quietly invading my head.

They were vulgar, cruel mantras telling me to hurt my best friend.

Though I was terrified, I approached it, regretfully.

Originally, it held my reflection. But the more I stared, the more it warped into me pushing her out in front of a large bus.

It showed me everything.

The words that were exchanged, the panic in our voices, even the gruesome death - down to the last detail.

I vomited vehemently and stumbled across the floor.

I begged my best friend to get out of bed, to go look in the mirror. When she did - nothing.

She saw nothing - just us - and I did too.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

Days passed, and as they did, the whispers grew.

I had to be around the mirror initially, but then they started following me.

In the car. At work. The grocery store.

Everywhere.

They yelled at me - called me worthless, a failure, as if I wasn’t meeting their expectations.

I felt crazy, but she didn't believe me when I blamed the mirror.

She thought I was dramatic, yet she agreed to get rid of it - but I had to be the one to move it.

Nervously, I grabbed both ends and began to lift.

Just then, a sudden sharp pain streamed across my palms.

I shrieked - the mirror remained unmoved.

Blood poured out of my hands as I noticed deep lacerations on both palms.

I looked concernedly at her.

"It must have some jagged edges. Come on, let's get you cleaned up."

I lost it.

“If this mirror doesn’t want to move, then I’ll just smash it!”

I grabbed a hammer and marched back to the mirror, my reflection looked as if I had the narrowest, eeriest grin.

My hair disheveled - eyes bulging.

I primed to swing harder than a Major League home run hitter.

Just as I released, my friend grabbed my wrist.

“Don’t!” She shouted. “Don’t break it! I’ll put it out by the dumpster, that way someone else can use it!”

No one should use this mirror, I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.

But I needed it out of my life.

“You can’t move it.” I whimpered, stunned.

She walked up, grabbed the sides and hoisted it off the ground.

I was relieved at first - then I wondered - why?

The mirror allowed her to touch it - wanted her to move it.

We walked outside into our dimly lit lot.

The dumpster sat just out of the radius of light - illuminated only by the headlights of passing cars.

She placed the haunted mirror on the sidewalk and I noticed it - the whispers intensified, as if they were the atmosphere itself.

My reflection stared at me, heinously - I stood frozen.

This is it.

The lot. The street. The shadows.

This was the scene.

“We have to go back inside.” I whispered, but it was already too late.

“Alright, alright. You should feel safe now.”

I wasn’t. Far from it.

“I will once we get in- oh God!”

Shadowy tentacles slowly emerged out of the mirror and lurched towards my friend.

I ran to her side and yanked her away.

But the whip-like arms lashed out more aggressively.

Screams of haunting terror echoed from the mirror.

It struck toward my friend once more - a kill shot surely had it landed.

I jumped between them, shoving her out of the way.

Her scream instantly muffled by the thud of a speeding bus. Red mist littered the air.

I collapsed in disbelief. My sobs cracked… then twisted.

Uncontrollably, I laughed while raking my fingers along my face.

Clumps of hair ripped out in frustration.

I knew I was next.

I turned to see my reflection in the mirror, smiling deviously.

The hammer lay beside me.

I gathered up all my strength and slammed the blunt steel into glass.

Again. And again. And again.

Each scratch quickly sealed back up before my next swing.

Out of pure rage - pent up insanity - I sent the hammer as hard as I could, screaming with fury.

A lone crack sprouted.

Then another - and one more.

Cracks webbed outward - not just in the mirror, but in reality itself.

They surrounded me - encapsulating my existence like a dome.

Once they met at the peak, everything as I knew it, shattered.

Darkness engulfed me in the form of fog.

Standing just ahead was the mirror in perfect condition.

And…

My best friend.

“You finally did it.” She cheered. “You broke your psyche. Now, the mirror is quelled.”

“H-How are you… alive?” I questioned, though no longer surprised.

“I never died. The mirror just needed you to believe that I did - in order to feast on your sanity.”

She ran her fingers along the reflection, as if she was petting the mirror.

“You see, we made a deal. It would let me live, as long as I kept you close enough to break.” She smirked.

I was betrayed.

“When? Why didn’t we work together?”

She gasped. “Why, since the beginning! The moment we saw it in the flea market, it showed me everything - including my death. It would have taken me, too, if I didn’t feed you.”

I didn’t understand. “Feed me? What does that even mean?”

The fog lifted enough for me to see remains scattered along the ground.

Skulls. Bones. Tattered clothing.

“Welcome to Hell.”

Suddenly a crack formed along her reflection’s neck.

Blood spewed out of her throat as she collapsed to her knees.

I heard her struggle as she gurgled. “W-We had a d-deal!”

Tentacles shot out of the mirror and sporadically pierced into her.

Her writhing screams of agony were abruptly cut off as the mirror shoved her body into the crack.

Her bones popped - flesh ripped - and blood wrung out of her orifices.

The crack repaired itself.

Just like that.

My best friend was gone.

I saw my own reflection curious, yet horrified.

A mark appeared on my reflection’s forehead, like a bullet flying into bullet proof glass.

In that same moment I felt a jarring blow against my skull.

Then, I plunged into sleep.

I awoke in my apartment bedroom, alone.

No friend. No mirror. Just the memories.

Days passed. Then months. Then years.

I’m sixty-three and I haven’t looked in a single mirror since that night.

That was, until my granddaughter mistakenly forgot my one and only rule - no mirrors.

She had left her portable vanity on my dining table, and I couldn’t look away in time.

I saw my wrinkles - my decaying flesh.

But I wasn’t alone.

Looking just over my shoulder - my best friend, smiling gently, still eighteen.

“It’s hungry, bestie.”
