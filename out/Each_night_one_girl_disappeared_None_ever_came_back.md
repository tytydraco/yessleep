She was born in a distant, warm land.
Her father loved her and her sisters deeply. Or so she thought.
The city of her childhood was always full of sunlight. Even the darkest courtyards shimmered.
She loved to lie on the warm sand in the evening, listening to the waves whisper in their salty tongue, and dream.
Of a great, beautiful future. Of people who would love her as sincerely as she loved the world.
She believed the world was waiting for her — tender, sun-kissed, sweet.
She was certain something good lay ahead.

But one day, they came to her father.
Silent, rough men in a dusty truck that rumbled through the courtyard.
Something about them triggered a primal fear, like the hiss of a snake in dry grass.
They examined her and her sisters — wordlessly, as if choosing.
They touched, grabbed, tilted their heads, whispered.
Her father was grim that day. He said nothing. He didn’t even meet their eyes.
Then they disappeared into another room. A long, hushed conversation.
When the door opened again — everything changed.

She and her sisters were dragged away, no explanation, no questions.
Bags, hands, shouts. The truck door slammed shut like a coffin lid.
As the wheels turned and the house receded, she looked back one last time.
Her father stood by the doorway.
Counting money.
He didn’t look back.

They drove for a long time.
Dust clogged every crevice, sacks scraped against the truck bed, but no one knew where they were going.
Soon, others joined — girls from nearby villages.
Some lay silently. Others trembled. Some tried to sink deeper into the corners, disappear.

But some cried.
One rocked back and forth as if trying to erase herself from the place.
Another shook, releasing short rasping breaths.
It was hard to watch. Harder still not knowing what came next.

When they finally stopped — it got worse.
They were shoved out, roughly dumped like sacks of grain.
A massive cargo plane waited, roaring like a starving beast.
Men in uniforms didn’t make eye contact. They just pulled, tossed, pushed.

“Careful with the goods!” someone in dark glasses barked.
“If you damage them — no one’s paying.”

They threw her onto the pile. It hurt, but she stayed silent.
Engines, sobs, silence — all mixed into one heavy pressure. Like the air before a storm.
She didn’t know what lay ahead. But she knew — childhood was over.
And something terrible had begun.

No one knew how long the flight lasted.
Time dissolved in the dark, under the engines’ scream.
Some girls slept. Others twitched. All drifted through space, together and alone.

When they landed, the dragging resumed.
New trucks. New hands.
It was a different country.
Cold. Grey.
Low skies. Rain-soaked earth. The air smelled of rust and dampness.
The language around them was harsh, sharp. The words sounded like curses.
The people were pale, bearded, in camouflage — with eyes that looked through you.

She and dozens of others were taken deeper into the land.
At last, they were shoved into a wet, moldy basement.
It smelled of mildew, sweat, and fear.
The ceiling was low. The lights flickered. Moisture ran down the walls like sweat.

They huddled together, trying to hold warmth.
No one spoke. Just trembling. Breathing. Staring blankly into concrete.
Even the air seemed to have given up.

This wasn’t just hopelessness.
This was forgetting.

Sometimes people came to the basement.
They never said much.
Each time, one girl disappeared.
None ever came back.
The silence grew heavier.

One day, he came.
A stocky, bearded guard with a cigarette led him in.
The man was dark-skinned, short, wiry, with almond eyes and several gold teeth flashing in a crooked grin.

He walked over to her.
Felt her up.
Slapped her.
Smiled.
And took her away.

She rode in the trunk.
Dark. Tight. Smelling of fuel and dust.
She felt nothing anymore. No fear, no hope. Just motion.

The apartment was filthy.
Men sat inside, smoking. Drinking. Laughing.
Bottles everywhere. Stale fumes and noise.
When he brought her in — they laughed louder.
Like it was a party.

They threw her onto the table.

One of the men took a knife.
Licked his cracked lips.
Came closer.

Was she really going to die like this?
Just like that?

Was he not even going to ask her name?

He didn’t.

Because **watermelons don’t have names.**
