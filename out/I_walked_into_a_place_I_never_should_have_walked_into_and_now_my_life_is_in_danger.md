Before I start, you need to know that this text is your death sentence. They will know you are reading this, and they will be coming after you just like they're coming after me.
Prepare yourself — they see everything. Good luck.

My name is Escribar.
If somehow you are reading this message now, they're probably reading it too.
I'm speaking from Brazil, but if this conspiracy goes as far as I think it does, the world map is probably manipulated to keep you and me under control. And if you still don't understand what I'm talking about, then my message has reached its receiver.

Have you ever felt like you are simply excluded from social circles where everyone else fits in?
I have. I've always been treated like I'm different. People just seemed to think that I had some mental health problems, and now I know those people were just bad actors.

I was hired as the night guard of my city's government building. They told me my job was to patrol the interior of the building and the backyard because drug dealers and addicts were using that unsupervised place to smoke and sell narcotics
(Very dumb choice of place, by the way) — and especially because of some vandals that had been causing trouble.
I'm a tall and relatively strong guy, so some rebellious teenagers shouldn't be a big deal.

After four months on this job, the security guard from the afternoon shift called me to say he had forgotten the security camera key hanging on the door.
We usually bring all the keys to the staff room and put them in the key drawer, so he told me to get the camera key and take it there when I finished my shift.
I usually don’t even remember those keys exist, since I don’t use them during my shift — only the main key and the backyard key.
I hadn’t been instructed to patrol only the main rooms and the backyard, and I even had access to the key drawer.
The only rule I had was: do not patrol the second floor.
And honestly, it had been boring these last few weeks, just walking from one place to another.
So I decided to supervise the building using the cameras.
That was my most horrible mistake.

An hour had passed since I turned on the monitor — 1:23 AM.
There are 32 cameras in total, but only 14 are on the ground floor: the halls, the front of the building, the meeting rooms, the staff room, and the main office.
I always thought it was strange that I was hired to protect the building but only had permission to observe specific places.
While taking a sip of my sugar-free coffee, I noticed a small rope sticking out from the monitor.
Thinking it was one of the screen's wires, I tried to fit it back into the monitor, but it just fell off.
The rope was tied to a small plastic rectangle that had been covering part of the back of the screen.
I checked the back of the monitor to see if I had broken anything.
Fortunately (or unfortunately), I hadn’t.
All I found was a small “tablet”-like screen that had been hidden behind the plastic piece I removed.

Not thinking too much, I turned on the tablet. It didn’t even have a menu — it just immediately opened four additional cameras, probably used by the morning shift guard.
Of the four cameras, only one worked: camera 3.
It was showing the management room, on the second floor — a place I wasn't allowed to go.

Before I even had time to think "Hey, I was told not to supervise this place," the camera detected movement.

It was... Pietra?!
The popular girl who studied with me.
She had always treated me badly during school.
She was wearing a beautiful and expensive all-black outfit, with a skirt that reached just below the knees.
I remembered that I was the security guard, and a lot of questions popped into my mind:
How did she get in? Why did she come here? What is she doing?

I watched her for a bit.
She moved her finger carefully across the surface of the manager’s desk — which caused it to... move and open a hidden hole in the ground?
“Maybe it’s a secret safe for the manager’s valuables,” I thought.

I sprinted to the key drawer and grabbed the management room keys, then ran to the second floor.
Getting the keys was useless, because the door was already unlocked and opened with the pressure of my hands as I tried to insert the key.

No one was in there.
The management desk was in place like always.
I looked to the corner of the room where the camera was supposed to be, but all I saw was concrete.
Am I going crazy?

I felt fear for the first time in this job.
I had never experienced a possible break-in — everything had always been calm.

I reached for my radio to call the authorities.
I don’t know why I hadn’t done this earlier, but with my hands shaking, the radio slipped from my fingers and shattered on the ground.

“SH*T!” I had never said that word with so much feeling before.

I looked at the opened management desk with a bit of curiosity.
If the girl had gone somewhere, it had to be through that hole.
Or — in the best-case scenario — I was just hallucinating.

I rubbed the desk surface with my fingers, trying to imitate what I saw her doing.
In some specific spots on the table, I could feel the surface dent slightly and make a clicking sound.
After pressing three of them, the desk moved and revealed an opening with a long staircase.

I entered the opening.

I got to the other side after descending the stairs. It was an elegant, elevator-like room — empty.
I saw a floor panel on one of the walls.
At that moment, I was just out of myself. I wasn’t questioning anything anymore.
I just wanted to see where the girl had gone, report it to the cops, and get out of that place as fast as I could.

I touched the only button present, and the ground started to descend.
It was a very elegant and baroque-like structure.

"You've come! It was about time. I have such sights to show you," said a clear and feminine voice coming from the walls.
Maybe it was Pietra?

The ground stopped descending. The walls opened.

A massive, enormous underground structure — like an infinite underground palace — all in a 1600s-like style.
There were classical and even some unknown old paintings, and the place had a strange but pleasant whiskey scent.
Millions of people dressed in smoke-colored suits and dresses, all wearing golden and blue masks.
They were walking, sitting, eating, dancing, drinking, or just standing in the endless rooms like it was some kind of eternal masquerade.

As soon as I stepped out, I realized I should’ve just patrolled the building as I was told to.

Two tall figures in long black robes and golden, overstuffed face masks stared straight into my soul.
In perfect synchrony and absolute silence, they pulled adorned blades out of their pockets.

I ran back into the elevator, feeling something I had never felt before, and smashed the only button on the panel.
The doors instantly closed, and I fell onto my back in complete shock.
I knew something was seriously wrong.

The doors opened as soon as I got back to the ground floor.
I rushed out of the elevator and into the management room again.
Stumbling, I ran to the door — but for some reason, it was now locked.
Whatever THEY are, they know I’m here.

As a security guard, I had to pass some physical and tactical training — nothing too special, but it could save your life.

I tried to stay calm while I picklocked the door with improvised tools.
But that calm faded away when I heard the elevator engine click again.
I hadn’t even realized I was holding my breath until I started choking.

I kicked the door near the handle, and I could hear the steel breaking.
I kicked it with all my strength, using the sound of the desk moving as motivation.
That’s when they arrived in the room with me.

The two golden-masked figures entered just as I managed to destroy the door handle.
I stepped out of the management room only to find another one of them at the end of the hallway.

"What are you?! What do you want with me?!" I screamed, pulling out the pocket knife I carried hidden on the right side of my waist under my pants and belt.
"So brave, huh? Such a waste," said one of them, with a modulated voice.

"I said wh—"
I couldn’t finish my sentence.
The one in the hallway sprinted at me with his golden-handled knife.
I saw that he had a gun in a holster on his leg — and I don’t know why he didn’t just shoot me.
The one who attacked me was the shortest of the three.

The management room door had its handle broken, but it was still mostly in place.
I shut the door as fast and as hard as I could, causing it to jam and trap the two other figures inside — at least for a while.
Right after that, the masked one in the hall reached me.
I managed to grab the hand holding the knife and we both fell to the ground.
I kicked him away, but he slashed my leg just below the knee.

As he stumbled back and fell again, I got up and ran toward the stairs.
The cut on my left leg was superficial — it wasn’t even bleeding yet.
I ran past all the rooms and unlocked the front door as fast as I could.

I was finally outside the building.
But my relief didn’t last long.

The roads were absolutely empty. No cars, no people.
It was 2:04 in the morning — at that time, people who work early are usually already on their way.

They are a militia. A new society. And only certain people are considered “worthy” of joining it.
I don’t know the criteria, I don’t know how many people are involved, and I don’t know what they’re doing.
But if just knowing they exist means I need to be extinguished — it’s definitely nothing good.

I ran toward the city’s police station — not too far from the building I work in.
On the way, I had the strange feeling that they knew exactly where I was, and I wasn’t dead yet because they simply didn’t want me dead — yet.

I reached the police station after two or three minutes of running.
I don’t even know how I managed to do it.

I entered through the front door — and what I saw made me realize how completely screwed I was.

All the police officers were unconscious.
So were the civilians waiting there.

Whatever they are, the government is involved — and they have control over everything, they somehow they Made everyone in the city pass out, so they can do whatever they want and leave no witnesses.I don’t know why they haven’t killed me yet.Maybe they’re just playing with their food.
Or maybe they’re planning something worse.

Either way, I’m hiding inside the police station and managed to arm myself.
I know they know I’m here
what did Pietra want to show me?

So I’m praying to God this message reaches someone.

If my prayer worked and you’re somehow reading this
I'm talking now from ***** **** - ** 
don’t trust anyone. They could be part of it.
Prepare yourself because they’ll come for you when you least expect it.

I don’t know what else to do.
I’ll just hope some of the cops wake up before they decide to neutralize me.

Good night, and good luck.
