Hey so I’m not keen with astrology or space or none of that crap. I’m more of a “stay inside and be lazy as shit” kind of guy. But awhile back my girlfriend (for the sake of keeping her name safe I’ll call her June) mentioned that she was super into it and that she even had a telescope when she was a kid but her brothers broke it being the children they were at the time. I thought I’d be slick and get her one for our 3 year anniversary, cause I wasn’t about to get hitched when everything was going so well yknow what I mean? It’s like my old man always said, “Don’t be greedy, be happy with what bullshit life lets you have”.

Anyways this was a couple months ago back in early April this year and I had heard from the chick at the Dick’s sporting goods when I bought it that there was a comet rolling by on Easter Day. After doing the math(admittedly on some fingers, don’t judge me i only cared about history class in highschool), I summed that up to be a week and a half before the anniversary so it gave a damn good opportunity to test the pricy mother out.

So I waited, two or three weeks go by, and I go out in my backyard while she’s at work— I’m sorry I forgot to mention June’s a E.M.T. She just got done with school so her hours at work take up more of the later hours of the day, it’s actually how we met. My foreman broke his leg and I got this little gal’s number while that dick was crying like a baby.  Anyways I set it up and first thing I did was look up where the Big Dipper and Little Dipper were. Yeah, no big deal. They were there, not really anything special. Had to look up Scorpio and that other one that goes with it, the solder that kills it in that story? Sorry like I said I’m not really one to care anything about stuff like that unless it’s war history and what weird ass gun Brendan Herrera bought this week on YouTube. You get the picture.

I saw the moon, it was cool. I can see how some people would think there’s a face on the moon. Growing up I thought I looked like a weird emoji version of the ghostface mask. Made me laugh whenever me and the boys would smoke a bowl back in highschool. I looked and looked and finally saw the comet. It was cool. Pretty even. But not life changing.

It wasn’t until I saw the explosion of it going through the moon that I may or may not have shit my pants. I don’t have a good understanding of space shit but I’m fairly certain that comets and asteroids are only visible when they’re in EARTH’S atmosphere, right? I’m not smart, but even my stupid ass knows that much. I shrugged it off, and just looked back at the moon but the area where I saw it land, more like collided into, was red and a weird hue of jade. Almost reminded me of the color of mold that the white part of bread gets to.

I zoomed in as much I could, I couldn’t obviously get a great detail of exactly what I was lookin’ at but fuck I’ve seen enough injuries on the job to know what fresh blood looks like. I put that damn ‘spyglass’ up and went back inside it was way too much for me. I made fun of Scientologists and UFO believers all my life. I didn’t need to think about it. It wasn’t my problem as far as I was concerned, Elon Musk can harvest the fucking thing for a new Tesla rocket.
I. DIDNT. CARE…
Until I went outside the next night and the corpse or rather body in this case, was no longer in the small blurry red smear in the scope-lens.

It’s been a couple months now and sense then, me and June are engaged. I never told her about the red crater on the moon. I never told I used the scope. And I’ll never look in one again. I am going to live my life ignorant and hopefully in bliss. June’s been talking about moving after we’re married. She’s wanting to move to Oklahoma, closer to her family. I wanna move to Anchorage in Alaska, it’s the cloudiest place in America according to Safari. And that’s fine with me.
