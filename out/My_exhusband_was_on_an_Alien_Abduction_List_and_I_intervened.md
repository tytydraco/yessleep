That's when and where Todd was going to be abducted before I stepped in.

Someone—we still don't know who—posted a comprehensive list titled “**They Will Be Abducted**” followed by a long series of names. 

I’m not going to post them all, but I’ll post the first twenty:

NXXX Roberts

MXXXXX Eastman

SXXXXX Iwata

JXXXX Rodriguez

TXXXX Hunter

GXXXX Henderson

UXXXXX Kelenov

VXXXXX Patel

OXXXX Carter-Free

EXXXXX French

SXXXXX Strong

It was originally posted on a UAP/Paranormal forum (which I’ll just call UFO.org. If you want the real link, DM me).  But the reason I’m posting this story is because it was brought to my attention that my ex-husband Todd was number 20.

I thought it was as ridiculous as you do right now, and most people did. It was overlooked and ridiculed for months … until users started to login and comment about people on the list who have *literally gone missing.*

All of the top 15 had become missing persons cases all throughout North America. An involved UFO.org user made this connection and found ways of reaching out to the upcoming listed names and their circle of family/friends. 

Which is how I was contacted because Todd didn't have anyone except me.

What a surprise.

Long story short, I divorced Todd in my early 20’s because his obsession with firearms was sabotaging our relationship. (EG: He sold his wedding ring to buy a ‘Desert Eagle’.)

I was messaged by a UFO.org fanatic (which I’ll call UFOwen) on Facebook. He reached out to me because according to FB, Todd and I were still in a relationship.

I’ve always avoided Todd if I could manage it, but because his life was at stake, I reached out and told him that he was guaranteed to be abducted unless he stayed at a hotel fifty miles away.

He agreed to do it. And he also agreed to let UFOwen leave a crash dummy in his place with a camera, GPS and radio transmitter.

Yes, it is as crazy as it sounds.

The dummy was still inside Todd’s apartment at *Dec 25th 2024, 9:07am* when the abduction was to occur.

And holy Francis Bacon, Did it ever occur.

\*\*\*

UFOwen posted the video right away. It was terrifying. 

Blinding white lights. Floating silhouettes of tiny large-headed figures. A vibrato screaming sound that you could feel in your loins as you listened. Wherever the crash dummy was taken—the avalanche of radiation destroyed the camera sensor within seconds.

It was exhilarating to behold.

And It was also a miracle that the footage was even recoverable. Apparently the GPS said the dummy was rocketed to a place somewhere between the stratosphere and the moon.

The video signal lasted *just* long enough for us to receive this 6 second video that went viral on UFO.org

My ex-husband Todd was safe. UFOwen became head admin of the forum. And I had joined a small, but passionate community of people trying to prevent abductions.

\*\*\*

Who posted this UFO abductee list? We still don't know. But we do know it has been 100% accurate so far. We have treated the **Abduction List** as scripture and gotten in contact with almost everyone remaining on it to make sure they remained safe. UFOwen has invested in more crash test dummies to try and record the alien captors, but none have been as successful as the first.

About 2 months after joining this community and getting really involved, I had an opportunity to truly prove myself.

\*\*\*

According to the list, the next abductee was a woman named Gabriella Davis. The abduction was to happen in 2 weeks near New Mexico. Gabriella had ignored all of our messages and calls. She thought UFO.org was a scam and she wasn't falling for it.

So I decided I would go catch her in person at work, it was only an hour away from where I lived.

\*\*\*

She was a landscaper in her mid-30s. Gabriella was running a hedge trimmer along an expansive lawn outside a court building. She had to take off her yellow ear muffs to listen to me as I recited my introduction from memory.

“Hello Gabriella, My name is Martha, I’m part of an investigative group that has come across some sensitive material online. This material has listed your name, which means you are at-risk for a kidnapping in the near future.”

“Kidnapping?” Gabriella turned off the motor on her trimmer.

“Yes. But don’t be alarmed, we can arrange to make sure you are safe and for this threat to pass.”

She scoffed. “Are you a part of those UFO wackos?”

I paused for a moment. Probably for too long.  “I am part of a credible organization that has intercepted a threat on your life”

She started up her trimmer again. “Sorry. Not interested. Good luck scamming someone else.”

I walked away, because what else could I do? Plan B was to return later pleading with a free hotel offer. In the meantime, I drove by to take a look at her address and see what kind of apartment she lived in.

And that's when the real problem became apparent. You see: Gabriella lived in a prison.

\*\*\*

She was part of a parole program which allowed her to still work 40 hours a week while she served time in a minimum security facility. There's no way in hell she would be able to stay in a hotel.

Even if we managed to change the cell she was staying in, we really didn’t know if that would ensure any safety.

I called UFOwen and we bounced ideas. All of them involved lying to the prison warden.

\*\*\*

It took several hours on hold to eventually book an appointment with one of the prison’s administrators. He was willing to see me on his lunch break in his tiny office.

“So there's a threat to one of our cellmates?”  the admin asked, eating his danish.

“Yes, there is. Gabriella Davis is facing immense danger in three days unless she is moved.”

He wiped his mouth. “Source?”

“Our source is an anonymous gang tip”

“A gang tip? 

“Yes.”

He laughed. “Listen, we get threats against our prisoners all the time. We don't have time to sort out which to take seriously.”

I exhaled audibly.

“But because you came all this way. Tell you what, we’ll throw Ms.Davis into solitary.”

“Solitary?”

“Yes. A quarantine far from any windows. Far from any entrance. She’ll be miserable, but she'll be safe.”

I didn't know if that was true. But it's not like we had any other options. I thanked him for the change.

\*\*\*

The day of Gabriella’s abduction, I stayed in the city, and even convinced my ex Todd to come help. (He owed me a favor ever since I saved his life last time.)

We waited outside the courthouse and watched Gabriella push her lawnmower in even, straight lines across the parliamentary grass.

Todd ran up and offered her five hundred bucks and a free night at the Hilton like we planned (the plan B), but I could hear her complain and shoo Todd away.

It was worth a shot.

Then, without any warning, Todd grabbed her by the scruff of her uniform, and pulled a gun from his pocket. He marched her straight into the back of my hatchback and yelled at me to get in the driver's seat.

“Jesus Christ Todd! What’re you—?”

“Get in the car and drive!”

I got into the car. I could see Gabriella was totally freaked out by the weapon.

“Todd, put the gun away. This isn't what we agreed on.”

“For fuck's sake, we are trying to save your life Gabby!” Todd’s pupils were wide and erratic, he always had poor impulse control. “If you stay in jail tonight, a freakin' alien is going to take you! Show her the video Martha! Show her the video!”

I sighed, but relented, I didn't want to make things worse. My phone played the 6-second abduction video that UFOwen had recorded.

“You see that shit?” Todd practically spat at Gabriella. “That could've been me. And that’s going to be *you* tonight unless you get away!”

“Let *go* of me!” Gabby yelled. “You're fucking up my parole!”

All of our yelling caught the attention of one of her co-workers who walked up holding large shears.

“Martha! Hit the gas, NOW!”

“No Todd! This wasn't part of the deal!”

But Todd wasn't having it, he rolled down the window and fired off a shot to indicate he was serious.

The co-worker holding the shears screamed and ran off. 

I hit the gas and drove straight into a streetlamp.

\*\*\*

This is what I get for giving people a second chance.

I should have distanced myself from Todd after our last entanglement, but no, I was stupid enough to have invited him along. And now, not only was Gabriella stuck back in her regular prison cell, but Todd and I were *also* stuck in a holding room at the prison’s front.

“Why did you bring a gun you moron?”

“Why did you crash our escape car?”

We were back in our old ways, except now we were anxiously watching the clock outside our jail bars as the hour hand neared eleven. Gabriella’s abduction was supposed to occur at 11:01 PM.

“You think they’ll abduct me too?” He asked, clearly worried. “You think they'll try again?”

“Christ. I don't know, Todd, but if they do, you deserve it.”

He looked at me with a mixture of fear and sadness. Shocked that I’d be so callous.

In the moment it felt good to say it. But I’ve since regretted those words.

\*\*\*

At 11:01, a white light appeared in our cell.

I screamed and ducked beneath my seat.

Todd yelled for help through the bars, pleading with an empty hallway, but no one replied.

Out from the blinding portal, hovered a small, gray, anthropoid *thing.* It lifted its tiny hand, and within an instant, Todd went ramrod straight. 

My ex-husband's entire body lifted off the ground. His 'TapOut' shirt fluttered from an unseen wind.

I reached forward, meagrely trying to grab Todd’s foot, but the gray *thing* beside him sent me a leer.

Its massive black eyes reflected tiny versions of myself in a pit of fire.

Suddenly, it felt like I was being roasted in open flames. The pain was overwhelming. I writhed and screamed for what felt like an eternity before a guard came and banged on my cell.

“What the hell is going on?” he yelled, more annoyed than astonished.

When I opened my eyes, I could see my skin was absolutely fine. Nothing was burnt.

Beside me laid a bundle of handcuffs, clothes and shoes. Everything that Todd had been wearing.

“Where the hell is your husband?” the guard shouted, pointing at the empty seat.

I collapsed onto my bench and hugged myself. Relieved that the pain had stopped.

“*Ex*\-husband. And I don't know.”

\*\*\*

That day, both Gabriella and Todd had been abducted. I failed my mission.

After 24 hours in custody I was let go, my only crime being the car crash afterall. The police also had far bigger fish to fry in figuring out how both Gabrielle and Todd *disappeared* under their watch.

I was interviewed by the FBI, but played ignorant, I did not want to get sucked into a blackhole of bureaucratic compliance. I told them my ex-husband had lost his temper and ruined a trip aimed to rekindle our marriage.

I felt like I had failed UFOwen and his website, felt like I had fucked everything up and disappointed this new community I’d been trying to impress. I told them that I completely understood if they wanted to revoke my user membership.

But UFOwen told me not to worry about it. He said that despite what happened, I was still his most valuable contact.

*Without you, we wouldn’t have been able to even try and save Gabriella,* he messaged. *Don't bring yourself down. Besides, we need you now more than ever. Check this out.*

He forwarded me a screenshot of that comprehensive list titled **They Will Be Abducted.** 

It had been updated.

Dozens of new names had been added. Dozens and dozens of new abductees.  

Then he sent me part 2 of the screenshot. Then part 3, then part 4. Over a thousand people were going to be abducted in 2025 apparently.

*Fucking hell.* I texted back. *Are the aliens retaliating or something?*

*I think they're really, really angry that we're* [*interfering.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/comments/1g0837r/welcome/)
