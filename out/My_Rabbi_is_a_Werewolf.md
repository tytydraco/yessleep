Okay y’all, get all of the “Werewolf Bar Mitzvah” jokes out of your system now, this shit is serious. My rabbi is a werewolf.



I’m originally from the outskirts of Northwest Baltimore. If you aren’t familiar with the area, it’s heavily Jewish. My family wasn’t particularly religious, though we did go to synagogue for the big holidays. I never felt a strong connection to the religious side of Judaism, though I did like the culture and community around it. When I moved out of state for college, I made sure to join my university’s Hillel. 



I always knew I wanted to come back to Maryland. When a job opportunity opened up at a company near my hometown, I made sure to apply. I got the job and moved back to the area not long after. The town I settled in was a tad rural, though not too far from where I grew up. I could now claim the town of Boring, MD (yes that’s the actual name, look it up) as home. It was a quiet little place, more a collection of houses than a full-fledged town. The local synagogue was housed in the Jewish retreat nearby. I joined up not long after I moved in. As I was introducing myself to everyone, they all espoused how lovely the town is and how close the small congregation is. Everyone looked out for each other, whether they were Jewish or not. There was one odd rule though; there was a curfew. Ostensibly to keep the kids of the town from causing trouble, everyone had to be inside before midnight. I go to bed early so I didn’t have a problem complying with this.



I met Rabbi Goldberg the first day I went to temple. Rabbi Goldberg was about 6’6 and hairier than a gorilla. A thick, billowing white beard sprouted from his chin. Truly a beast of a man. His huge, hulking frame belied the kindness he bestowed on everyone he met. He welcomed me into the congregation with open arms. Everything was going great for the first few months. I hit the ground running with my new job, and I had built up a strong rapport with my congregation. Everything was as it should be, until two kids decided to break curfew. They picked the worst possible night for it too. 



The full moon is a grim time in Boring. Everyone is walking on eggshells, and if services are scheduled for the day after a full moon, they are canceled. I was late getting home that night. I was called in for a late shift at the office and had only gotten home around midnight. On my way home I saw two teens sneaking out towards the woods. I was going to call after them, but then I noticed Rabbi Goldberg heading in the same direction. I figured he’d catch up to them, so I made my way home.



They found Trevor’s arm first. Best the police could tell, he had been attacked by a wild animal. In rural Baltimore County, there’s not a lot that can do what was done to him. We occasionally get bears coming down from the mountains, so the police assumed that’s what happened. They found Jake a bit further down the road, mangled but still alive. Trevor was Christian, but we held a memorial service for him all the same. Jake’s family was not in attendance, instead opting to stay by his bedside as he recovered. During the service I noticed everyone was giving the Rabbi a wide berth, like he was infected with the plague. Did they think he maimed Jake and killed Trevor? Surely there’s no way an elderly man could do what was done, regardless of how massive he is. 



Time passed, and Jake was discharged from the hospital. What’s weird is that he was given the cold shoulder by the whole congregation. Even his family seemed distant from him. I didn’t understand why. At least I didn’t understand until livestock started going missing. The morning after that next full moon, a bunch of cows were reported missing by a local farmer. What remained of them were found a few days later, decomposing in the bottom of a ravine. This repeated the next full moon with some sheep. The month after that, more cows. Each time this happened, both the Rabbi and Jake were noticeably absent from services. 



Several more months pass, and we come now to the most recent full moon. By chance I had another late shift and got home around 12:40. On my way home, I saw Rabbi Goldberg again going into the woods, though this time he was not alone. Jake was lagging not far behind, like a pup following his dad. We all know about the stereotypes with clergy and young boys, so I wanted to follow them and make sure nothing nefarious happened. I caught up to them out near the ravine. Both wore the same expression of shock and abject fear. “You cannot be here! You need to flee, now. For our sake and your own”, hissed the Rabbi. He clearly didn’t want me interfering in what was going on that night. I pressed the matter, asking what he thought he was doing with a young man past curfew. Before he could respond, both he and Jake doubled over in pain. It was then that I learned why he wanted me to flee. 



Rabbi Goldberg transformed first. Like I said earlier, he was already an imposing man. He may have been in his 80’s, but he was still built like a linebacker. I noticed his shirt start to bulge, then rip. Poking out from the tattered cloth was thick, gray fur. His long, gnarled fingers contorted into fur-covered mitts. Each finger was topped with a razor-sharp claw. Even though he was hunched over, I could see he was much, much larger than he had been as a human. Jake went through a similar transition, though he was much smaller than the venerable Rabbi. Jake had dark brown fur and similarly sharp claws. When they looked up at me, I finally understood why the curfew was in place. Gone were the kind eyes of Rabbi Eliezer Goldberg. In their place stared yellow pits of malice, almost glowing in the moonlight. His soft, caring face had contorted into a sickening mix of human and wolf. Yellowing fangs bared, he no longer looked at me with fear, but with hunger. Jake looked very much the same, though younger. 



The last thing I remember was sprinting through the woods, ignoring brambles tearing at my clothes, branches smacking me in the face. I had reached the edge of the woods, truck in sight, when I lost consciousness. I awoke in the hospital several days later. Apparently a neighbor found me at the edge of the woods barely clinging to life. I had lost a lot of blood, and the doctors were not sure I was going to make it. In addition to the wounds sustained running through the woods, I had a large bite taken out of my right side, and scratches on my back. I was very lucky to be alive. 



I got discharged from the hospital yesterday after healing much faster than the doctors expected. I was still tender, but I no longer felt like a chew toy. I was famished, so I went to the local diner. Nobody would look me in the eyes. They were treating me the same way as Jake and the Rabbi. By now I knew why they were ostracized. They were werewolves. Would I become one too? Maybe that’s why my silver Star of David necklace is itching against my skin. Anyways, I gotta go. I am really hungry for steak, prepared blue.
