Hello everyone. This is a new experience so do bear with me. I don’t spend much time on Reddit, or the internet at large, but I really couldn’t think of who else to share this with. Sure, I could tell my family. I could tell my friends and colleagues, but none of them would be able to tell me what happened. None of them could tell me for certain that I’m acting paranoid and should simply ignore it. But what happened last night is something that I can’t explain, and I need to find people that can help me make sense of it all.

I have never had a lucid dream. I’ve had people tell me about what they’re like, and explain how surreal an experience it was, but I have never been graced with the experience myself. The idea fascinated me. For those of you who don’t know, the only real quality that makes a dream “lucid” is one’s recognition of the fact that they are in a dream. Sometimes the dreams are incredibly vivid, sometimes the dreamer is able to control the world around them and the events they experience, but as long as they are aware that they are inside the dream, it’s enough. Like I said, this has never happened to me. I have had dreams where I can remember every tiny detail, and dreams that were so complex and lifelike that I don’t know how to differentiate them from the real world. A time or two, I’ve even had dreams where I could control the world around me. All this time, however, I have never known that I was dreaming.

Because of this, lucid dreams have been something of an obsession of mine. I’d spend my time watching videos or reading articles on dream theory. I never went so far as to read Freud’s work, but the rabbit holes I ventured down were vast, nevertheless. In my compulsion, I had researched tutorials on how to lucid dream. I knew the steps, but every night I would tell myself, “It’s already too late, you need sleep,” or “You have a busy day tomorrow, and trying to lucid dream is only going to make you feel groggy.” I had never mustered up the will to try it until last night.

I was ready. I made sure that I went to bed early, I made sure that I didn’t have anything I needed to get up early for, and I made sure I had no excuse besides pure sloth. Then I set up the alarm. Lucid dreams, and most dreams in general, occur during REM sleep. This is a stage of sleep characterized by rapid eye movement (where the REM comes from). During this time, rates of respiration and blood flow change wildly, and the brain heats up more than any other period of the sleep cycle. These bouts of REM sleep happen quite predictably, and I ended up setting a timer for 4 and a half hours to make sure I woke up at the right time. Once everything was prepared, I got in bed, and let the warm embrace of the bedsheets wash over my body.

I woke up feeling absolutely drained. This alarm was way too early, but I told myself that I waited too long to stop now. Without opening my eyes, I reached for my alarm and felt for the shutoff. Once I had finally managed to hit the off button, I laid perfectly still for as long as I could. With every breath I took, I felt my body relax and loosen. First my shoulders, then my arms, my legs, all the way down to the muscles in my feet slowly melted into the bed. I don’t know how long I was thinking to myself, solving math equations and reciting things I had memorized in school. I didn’t move for what felt like forever. All I saw was the black offered by my closed eyes, and all I heard was the occasional creak of my house settling. Finally, the itching came. A burning itch ripped across my arm. I winced, but didn’t attempt to move. Another one on my foot. It felt like someone had just rubbed my body with ivy. The sensation wasn’t painful, but the compulsion to move was so great I’m not sure how I dealt with it. My mind started telling me to give up and sleep;  a little voice in my head singing discouragements. The thoughts became constant. Finally, in one instant, everything was gone. Almost there. I imagined myself rolling out of bed. Without moving, I felt my body turn on its side and felt the blankets roll with it. I felt my torso approach the edge of my mattress and fall off.

 When I hit the ground I shot up. My room was dark, but not so dark that I couldn’t see. I reached up and grabbed my nose. Firmly sealing up both nostrils, I took a deep breath through my nose. Air flooded my lungs – it worked. It actually worked! This was a dream! Just to make sure, I glanced at my reflection in the mirror above my desk. I looked over to see a blurred, warped reflection staring back at me. The sight made me uneasy, but I brushed off my nerves. Excited to see what awaited me, I threw open my bedroom door. Sunlight bathed the rest of my house in a golden warmth. I ran down the stairs and rushed outside.

It wasn’t the outside I knew. Or, more accurately, not the outside I had expected. For context, my family owns a small chunk of property in Indiana that I’ve been going to since I was a kid. It’s a small mobile home situated on a hill overlooking a small cornfield and a pond, with an overgrown gravel driveway slinking in between the two. This was the sight the greeted me; a stark juxtaposition from the suburban neighborhood that I had anticipated. I turned around to see the small mobile home, not exactly a perfect recreation of the real thing, but close enough for me to know where everything was.

As I was still trying to process the sight that greeted me, my father came out of the house, a blank expression plastered on his slightly blurry face. I called out to him.

“Hey dad, what’s going on?”

He looked at me, face unmoving, but still producing sound, “Just need to get some things in town. I’ll be back soon.” The response was in his normal tone. Casual, passive, with a slight tinge of frivolity that gave away his good mood. It was exactly how I expected him to answer the question. If it wasn’t for his static face, it would be no more than an average interaction with him. Without another word, he hopped in his truck and sped down the hill and beyond the tree line. I spent some time exploring the area, soaking in the little details that my brain got right, and the small inconsistencies where it couldn’t quite remember where something was, or how big an object appeared from a given distance. Like I said, it was very strange, but it was an unreal  experience.

The sun began to set. I was alone. Still outside, I tried enjoying the sunset, but for whatever reason, it didn’t feel right. I chalked it up to the dream making things just slightly uncanny, but as the moment wore on, the feeling got worse. There was an air of discomfort, like a primal instinct in me was starting to realize something was wrong.

 I heard a dog bark. I looked to my right to see my dog, Abram, had appeared out of nowhere, growling at the tree line. Weird. He was nowhere to be found until just now, I hadn’t even thought of him. I guess just a weird addition my mind came up with. While the field at the bottom of the hill pushed the tree line far back, the forest did go around our pond and creep up the hill next to our home, to the point where it came almost 30 yards away from the house. This was the section of forest Abram was locked on. He didn’t move, didn’t blink, I couldn’t even see him breathe, but he had his upper lip curled into a snarl. I stared at the patch of woods. As soon as my eyes landed on it, my gut screamed at me to get inside. It felt like something was there; something that wanted to do harm. I couldn’t see a thing – the forest was shrouded with the darkness provided by the sunset – but I knew something was there. Something was watching me. I wasn’t alone in this dream.

One of the downsides of having a small mobile home is that there are windows everywhere. They are an inescapable presence, and the only solution for any privacy is curtains. While the real house was graced with such a luxury, curtains were one of the few details my brain missed when creating the dreamscape. My gut told me hiding from this… this thing, whatever it was,  was a necessity, but I had nowhere that would gift me such solitude. My dog was gone, his departure just as instant as his arrival. The sky had grown into a dark, starless void, but I was still able to see outside due to some ambiguity in the dream’s logic. The Presence didn’t leave. Rather, it grew with the darkness. I lost the ability to see outside. I wanted to wake up, but I didn’t, and still don’t know how to do so on command.

At this point it felt like I was going insane. I was alone in a house deathly afraid of something I hadn’t heard or seen, and I was cowering underneath my kitchen table.

The feeling stopped. Whereas my instincts had been to cower and hide just a second ago, I felt completely fine. Better than fine, actually. In the moment, my mood had transformed into one of bliss. I felt like my worries had been swept away by a flood of pure high. I could feel my gut screaming at me, begging me to turn around, to hide, to do anything to get away from whatever waited beyond the safety of my home, but the alarm was dull, distant, unimportant; like my body had grown used to the tirade and tuned it out. I stood. The night was silent. The property I had visited every Summer in the real world, the one I knew, would erupt with the chorus of frogs, crickets, and the occasional owl to create a beautiful symphony that lulled me to sleep in minutes. The real property sat under the expanse of the universe, and was illuminated by scores of fireflies, their mating ritual creating a mural that lit up over the nearby pond. This was not the place I knew. This place was silent, this place was dark, this place was empty. Despite this, I looked out the window. In the solitude and silence,  something looked back.

A deer stood outside my window. It was standing at the backside of the house, about 20 feet away from the back door. I don’t know if it was the dark of the night, but it was devoid of all color except for its eyes. It’s eyes were a pale yellow and contrasted starkly with the greyscale body of the deer. They shone against the black like a smooth-cut amber, but did not light the area around them. While the rest of the dream, though vivid, had been full of imperfections and inconsistencies, this deer looked flawless. I could make out every hair on its body, the beads of moisture on its nose, every minute detail was so precise I had to remind myself this was a dream.

It looked at me, unmoving. It’s eyes were piercing, empty of all feeling or emotion. They grasped me in their gaze, and I was unable to do anything but stare back into the golden orbs. That feeling, the one of dread, had come back, this time reinvigorated by the newfound sight. The deer did nothing, but I knew it was wrong. I didn’t know why, and I still don’t know why, but this thing did not belong. This was not a part of my dream. My entire body began to shake, I was unable to move, breathe, blink, nothing but continue to let this thing observe me. It felt like we had been staring at each other for hours, days, weeks, who knows? The sunlight never came, only a never-ending emptiness. I saw nothing but that deer, and that deer saw nothing but me. I became dead inside; I had lost care or focus for all but the being that looked into my soul. The walls around me filled with mold, eventually withering away, its prolonged existence ended by the elements that I remained unaware of. Soon, the floor gave out under me, but my body did not fall. Or maybe it did. My focus did not break to inform me of what happened; I simply stopped feeling the carpet that my feet rested on. I stopped feeling my feet soon after. A numbness spread across my entire body until all I felt was the gaze of the eyes. Nothing I could do was able to wake me up. My alarm, however, was a different story.

Once eternity had ended, I finally woke up in my bed. Still alone, still shaken, but safe. My alarm had gone off. Truth be told I don’t know how else I would have woken up. They say that in lucid dreams, often the dreamer has the power to change or control what goes on in the dreamscape. There, I was powerless.

That was last night. I decided to write down what happened just to see if anyone can make sense of what I went through. As disturbed as I am, I want to try the same thing later to see what happens. Maybe things will go better, maybe whatever was in my head has packed up and found some other guy to freak out. I’m not sure. If you guys know anything about what just happened, please let me know. Thanks in advance for anything you guys come up with. I’ll update y’all next time I try this if anything weird happens again.
