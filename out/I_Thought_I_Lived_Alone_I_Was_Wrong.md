I don’t really know why I’m writing this.
Maybe because it’s been three months and I still can’t sleep without checking the locks five or six times.
Maybe because part of me still wants someone to tell me I imagined all of it.

But I didn’t.

And I need someone to believe me.

So… my house is in a pretty quiet neighborhood. Not old or creepy, just… normal. I never believed in ghosts or anything like that. I still don’t know if this was paranormal, or just something worse — something real.

Late September, around 2:30 AM, I woke up because I heard footsteps upstairs.

The thing is, I live alone.

My first thought was someone broke in.
I froze, listening. The footsteps were slow… almost careful. Like someone was trying not to be heard.

I grabbed the only thing near me — a heavy flashlight — and waited. No footsteps for almost a full minute. Then, suddenly…

Creak.
Creak.
Creak.

Coming down the stairs.

I wanted to call the police, but my phone was charging in the kitchen. I was trapped between the stairs and the back door, and every part of me was screaming to run, but I forced myself to stay and listen.

The steps stopped halfway down.

Then I heard breathing.

Not mine.

It sounded like someone was standing there — just out of view — breathing like they’d run a marathon.

I finally found the courage to whisper, “Who’s there?”

The breathing stopped instantly.

Then a voice — low, strained, and not quite right — said:

“I live here.”

My whole body went cold.

I backed up toward the door, raising the flashlight. My hand accidentally brushed the windchimes hanging near the door and they chimed softly.

That tiny sound must’ve broken something, because suddenly the footsteps ran down the stairs — fast — impossible fast.

I didn’t wait. I threw open the door and sprinted outside barefoot. I ran to my neighbor’s house and banged until he opened. He called the police.

They searched the whole house.

No forced entry.
Nothing missing.
No sign anyone was ever inside.

But here’s the part that still keeps me up at night:

When they opened the attic, they found something.

A blanket.

A half-eaten can of food.

And a plastic bottle full of urine.

Someone had been living above me.

For how long?

No one knows.

They never found the person.

I changed the locks. Put cameras everywhere. Slept with the lights on. Weeks passed and things started to feel normal again.

Until last week.

I was reviewing footage from a motion alert triggered at 3:12 AM.

In the video, someone is standing at my back door.

Not moving.
Just staring directly into the camera.

I couldn’t see their face clearly, but the voice in the footage confirmed it.

Just before walking away, they whispered:

> “You shouldn’t have taken my room.

I’m trying to move.

But last night… the windchimes rang.

And there was no wind.
