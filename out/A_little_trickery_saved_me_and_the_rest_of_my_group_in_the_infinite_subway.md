\--------------------------------------------------

After both me and Marie managed to get some rest, our number one priority was to find more tickets, because if we met the Conductor now, it was game over for us. Considering we couldn't split up to cover more ground due to the fact that the road was blocked by the armed group, we walked together through the carts she has visited previously, hoping to find stuff she previously missed. As we moved cart by cart, we were checking for tickets everywhere: under the chairs, in the corners, below the hot pipes, etc. 

"Where were you going?" asked Marie suddenly while we were searching.

"What do you mean?"

"Well, you weren't taking the subway just for the fun of it when you got here, no?"

"No, but what has that got to do with anything?"

"Nothing, really. I just wanted to break the monotony. It's so boooooring."

"I... I feel like you're not taking this seriously..."

She stopped searching and looked a bit upset after saying that.

"I am. It's just that... you know, you saying that you've been stuck here, not being able to get out for weeks, combined with whatever else is lurking around here... It's pretty stressful. I just wanted to take my mind off of it for a little bit."

"You're right. I am sorry. I've also been under a lot of stress here and honestly, as glad as I am that you're near me now, I also can't help but be sad when I look at you."

"Why?"

"Cause now you're also stuck here. With me. For who knows how long."

"We'll find a way out, right?"

My eyes dropped down. "I don't know. Maybe we'll just be stuck here forever. The guy who saved me was here for at least 20 years, the old lady from our group probably even longer." I looked her straight in the eyes and said "There are kids younger than us who've never seen the outside world, for god's sake."

She just gave me a smile and said "We can still hope..."

It was a fake smile. Marie never was that good at hiding her feelings, and quite frankly, I think that was why I began liking her all those years ago. It was very easy to see when she was happy, angry, when something bothered her... I hugged and said "We can still hope."

She hugged me back and after a little bit, we went back to searching for tickets. If we're gonna be here forever, might as well be sure that me and her can live for as long as possible. 

"I went to Central Park."

"What?"

"You asked me where I went. That's where."

"Oh, heh, I forgot I even asked. Feeling nostalgic?"

"You could say that, yea."

"Remember when we first met?"

"Of course. Sitting on a bench, admiring the view..."

"Sunny skies, a little breeze..."

"And," I hardly contained my laugh "someone just so happens to trip right in front of me."

"Hey," Marie replied back, slightly annoyed, "in my defense, the view was amazing!"

"Sure was. Still had to make sure you were ok though."

"I know, I know. Always the worrier."

"If I didn't worry, you would've probably fell over a cliff by now!"

"True... still not sure how that didn't happen be- Hey I found something!"

I went to where she was and sure enough, there were two tickets in the corner of the cart.

"Good, we're safe for now."

"Are you sure, though? This isn't sustainable. It took us this long to find only two of these."

"You're right, we have to do something else. If we could save the others, we'd have more than enough to last for a while. They stockpiled."

"Brilliant! Let's go save them!"

"Not so fast," I stopped her from rushing back. "Remember, they still have weapons. We need a plan"

"Right... right... We could take them by surprise?"

"Can't really do that. They don't seem like the type to let their guard down. Overwhelming them isn't good either, unless we want everyone to get killed."

"Hmmm.... Can we trick them somehow?"

"How could we possibly do tha-"

That's when an idea hit me.

"Marie, you said you were going camping, right?"

"Yes?"

"Did you take your art stuff?"

"Always carry it with me."

"Take it out for a second."

Rummaging through her backpack, she took out some art paper. I put one of the tickets we had on the paper and...

"It fits! The thickness, the color, everything! Do you have scissors?"

"I have my swiss army knife."

"Can you cut it like this? Draw a black circle on it?"

"I can give it a try. One second..."

Sure enough, after she was done, we had a new "ticket".

"Think this would fool the monster?"

"Doubtful, but this isn't for the Conductor."

"It's for the men!"

"Exactly. If we can sneak at least of these with them, we might at the very least catch them off guard."

"What are we waiting for then?," said Marie, jumping from her chair, extending her arm to me. "Let's go!"

"Let's!"

We were around fifty carts away from the group. Leaving her backpack halfway there, we rushed until there were only one left. Peering over, I saw a familiar figure standing watch. Matt.

"Stay back here," I whispered to Marie, "it would be easier to sneak if it's just me."

She nodded and hid under one of the chairs. I waved, hoping for Matt to notice and once he saw me, he waved to come closer. Once I reached the door, he opened it slightly and began to whisper. 

"Where have you been, kid?? Thought you bailed up on us!"

"To be fair, I was about to give up on everything. Luckily, I had someone that helped me."

"Someone?"

"Doesn't matter for now. How long can we talk?"

"A little bit. Jaques is asleep and has his men guarding him and the rest. Me and John are standing watch for now."

"Why didn't you run away by now?"

"They're keeping the rest as hostages. If any of us didn't come back when we were called, they'd shoot everyone else. Besides, if I managed to sneak away, can't get far with my busted leg"

"If that's the case, why didn't they kill you and leave?"

Matt gave me a very concerned look. "You're getting pretty dark kid. "Luckily" for us, they liked the system John built, enough so that they decided to settle here, and that bastard of a leader is fond of lording over others, thinking we're better alive than dead. He will still kill us if we disobey though."

"How are you guys holding up?"

"Terribly... Actually, it's only me in the cart, why not come take a look?"

"That sounds like a really bad idea..."

"They're not particularly keen. They're too cocky with their guns, think they have a safe pass, never notice what's around them."

After he said that, I sneaked in the cart and moved to the other side. What greeted my eyes almost made me puke. 

There were four people sitting around their leader, Jaques, pointing their guns at everyone else. He was sleeping with his head on the lap of Helen, who had a purple eye and a bloody lip. For that matter, everyone else were sitting in the far corner, bruised and beaten. Emily, Michael, Gabriel. Even Gertrude had a red hand print on her face. I was seeing red. So much so that I almost went in. Thankfully, Matt was holding me back.

"That's how we went along. The reason Helen went along with that is because Jaques "likes them with attitude." Said he "likes correcting disobedience". They keep John and Emily in check by threatening their kids. As for me, I can barely stand, much less fight."

I kept looking at the scene in front of me. In that moment, I noticed one of the men had a different air to him. An air like he was pained of what he saw.

"Who's that guy?," I said, pointing at the guard.

"Hm? That's Nick. Why?"

"He looks like he doesn't want to be there."

Matt nodded. "He did strike me as odd for hanging out with them. Never saw him being a dick to the rest. Didn't really do much either."

"He might be of help."

"How exactly?"

"Does Jaques hold the ticket stockpile?"

"Oh yes. He keeps it in one of the fridges, takes one for each of us when the Conductor comes. Always makes one of the men get tickets for him and his group first, says that if the pile runs out, he will have to make "necessary sacrifices"."

"We might have a way to get rid of him."

"We? And how?"

"You'll see. As for how..."

I told Matt what me and Marie thought of.

"That might be able to work actually. I'll offer for the first scavenge hunt. It's most likely gonna be Nick, so maybe we can work it out."

"Great, see you soon."

With that, I sneaked back to Marie and told her of what was going to happen. After that, we moved several carts and waited. With baited breath, hours have passed very slowly, but finally, we heard the door open.

"Start looking." We heard a man's voice say

"Sure thing, Nick. Just, be a little patient, will you? I can barely move after all."

"Look," he said in a hurried whisper "I understand, but both of us know if we don't get back soon enough, Jaques will go ballistic."

"If that's the case," I said, "maybe we can help."

After saying that, me and Marie went out of hiding, hands up.

"WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU TWO?!!" he yelled, pointing the gun at me.

"Easy now," said Matt, "they're friends."

"I-I-I have to go back to report to Jaques! You two, come with me!"

"Do you have to report to him, though?" said Marie. "You don't seem to like him very much."

He lowered his gun slightly. "He is my boss! I have too!"

"Look at you," I replied, "You don't believe that. We know you don't like him, we can see it."

"I-I..."

Matt put his hand on Nick's shoulder. "Please..." he said.

At that point, Nick just dropped to his knees and started crying. We lowered our hands and walked towards him.

Nick mumbled between his cries. "We were cops, for God's sake. We were supposed to help, not hurt other people!"

"There, there..." said Marie, putting her hand on his shoulder. "You can still help."

"How?? After everything we've done. After everything I've done?"

I told him what we wanted to do and he agreed. We gave him the fake ticket and sent him back with Matt, following him just a little bit behind. Eventually, they entered the main cart while we stood behind and watched.

"Aaaah," said Jaques "that was a good little nap. And look who's back! The cripple and the crybaby! Ain't that just lovely!"

He then stood up and gave Nick a big slap across the head.

"Found anything good?"

"We did find one tick-"

Jaques took the ticket before he even had time to finish.

"Fantastic! Oh? You returned just in time! Do you hear that, ladies? We have a visitor! Nick, give the rest the tickets while at it." Soon, me and Marie heard the Conductor's whistle. 

The leader clapped and said "Positions, everyone!"

After everyone settled in their chairs, the Conductor entered the cart and began checking. One by one, he got the tickets from the twins, their parents, Gertrude, Matt, Helen, Nick and the remaining three guys.

"Tickets, please." echoed the Conductor in front of Jaques. He then put the ticket on the long fingers of the conductor. 

There were a few seconds of silence, in which the Conductor did nothing. Suddenly, the lights began to flicker intensely. Loud screeches were coming from the Conductor as its body began to twitch violently, its arms flailing around, while the void of its head was losing its uniformity, making it look more like a cloud than anything else. Soon however, just as suddenly, he went still again. His back was arched unnaturally, having a very sharp angle, with his long has bent backwards, touching the floor. The conductor broke the silence by yelling in deep, echoing growling. 

"COUNTERFEITING IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE. CRIMINALS WILL NEED TO PAY FOR THEIR CRIMES."

With the lights still flickering, the pale white uniform of the Conductor burst open, revealing a large, jagged mouth. Rows of teeth were spinning inside and outside at blindingly fast speeds, with a blood red eye in the middle. Five tongue like things began extending from the Conductor towards Jaques, grabbing him by his neck, wrists, and ankles. 

"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING??!!" yelled Jaques at his men. "SAVE ME!!!"

The three men began shooting at the conductor while Nick was staying perfectly still.

"ASSAULT ON SUBWAY PERSONNEL IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE. CRIMINALS WILL NEED TO PAY FOR THE CRIMES."

Fifteen more tendrils sprouted from the Conductor, grabbing the men and guiding them into three new opened mouth on the body of the Conductor. All the men were screaming while the group tried their best not to make a sound. When everything was done, all that remained of Jaques and his men were black puddles that dripped from the tendrils. The Conductor returned to its "normal" form and began walking towards me and Marie. Both of us, despite being completely traumatized by the shock of what we just saw, managed to get on chairs and present the tickets. The Conductor thanked us for our tickets and moved on.

Once it was out of ear shot, we entered in the main cart. Everyone else was still in their chair completely pale. After a little bit of time, everyone managed to calm down and decided to go to sleep to forget what just happened. After everything was done, I thought we had finally some time to sit down and relax a bit. I thought that we will have smooth sailing from here. Me, Marie and the rest could settle down.

I was wrong.
