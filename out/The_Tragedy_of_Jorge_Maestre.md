I remember Jorge Maestre very clearly. He was not a man I think I could ever forget, although ironically it seems that the world has done so anyways. I’ve heard very little about him during the past few years and I imagine it won’t be long until he’s forgotten entirely. 

&#x200B;

Personally, I’m not sure how to feel about that. On one hand, I guess it’s a shame that a man of his talents should fade into complete obscurity. On the other hand, I think that the only one in the world to blame for the tragedy of Jorge Maestre is Jorge Maestre himself. 

&#x200B;

I first came into contact with Jorge sometime around 2015. I’d been living in an apartment just outside of New York City at the time and had been attending a painting class run by a friend of mine, a woman named Olivia Clifford. 

&#x200B;

I’d met her through an old college friend, and Olivia had made a decent enough career for herself as a painter. I myself had dabbled in it when I was a teenager, but I’d never really pursued it that closely. Sketching seemed more my speed. But - when my life took a more chaotic turn, I needed something to do with my hands to keep my mind off of other events and painting seemed like just the thing. 

&#x200B;

Olivia had told me that I was a natural… I still don’t know about that, but she kept insisting so I really didn’t have any choice but to believe her. And when she eventually suggested I display some of my work at a local exhibition, well… I figured that I had no valid reason to say no.

&#x200B;

Showing my art at the exhibition was a strange experience, to say the least. I only had a few pieces to show and most of them didn’t seem like anything special to me. Still life paintings of the view of the street from my modest apartment window, a nude model that had come in for Olivia’s class, and a crude self portrait. Compared to the other artists there, I really didn’t feel like I had much to offer at all. Even the paintings Olivia brought were breathtaking! The rocky cliffs of Nova Scotia, with cerulean ocean and ancient rocks, beaten into beautiful shapes by time and water. The wide open, colorful landscape of a canyon that seemed so indescribably vast, with new signs of life in every little crevice. Beautiful landscapes like that, which sucked me in like few other things had.

&#x200B;

As I wandered the exhibit, looking at the beautiful pieces that others had brought to display, I almost wondered why I’d ever let Olivia talk me into this in the first place. Everything I had to offer just seemed so drab in comparison.

&#x200B;

At least it did, up until I saw the paintings that everyone seemed to flock to admire. Those… those I still struggle to describe. 

&#x200B;

They weren’t breathtaking like Olivia’s were. In fact, if I’m being perfectly honest they were actually a little ugly. Uglier than mine for sure. Although the ugliness seemed to be the point of them. This wasn’t the work of some amateur like me. Whoever painted these had a very specific vision in mind and he executed it perfectly. It was just unfortunate that his vision had to be so indescribably miserable.

&#x200B;

The collection of 14 paintings were displayed side by side, each one similar yet vastly different at the same time. Most of them depicted people, although not all of them did. Some were landscapes. But each one had a desolate quality to it.

&#x200B;

The people depicted in those paintings usually had intense eyes, with cold expressions. 

&#x200B;

In one of them, an old man smoked a cigarette, looking out upon a stormy background with a haunted look on his face. Every line in his face was painted with precision and told a story. The faraway look in his eyes was disturbingly lifelike. These were the eyes of a man who had seen horrors beyond most peoples comprehension, and I don’t mean that in the ‘H.P. Lovecraft cosmic horror’ sense. I’m talking about the all too real horrors witnessed by men at war. Killers. Butchers. People who have perpetrated the kind of incredible violence that scars their very souls. I know that look all too well. I used to see a similar look in the eyes of my father as I grew up. 

&#x200B;

In another one of the paintings, a woman with short black hair was sobbing. I could see an attempt at a smile on her lips, but there was no joy in it whatsoever. It was just a forced facade. The pained look of a broken woman who was trying to hold back her agony and failing miserably. Looking at it for too long actually made me a little sick.

&#x200B;

  “It’s beautiful, don’t you think?” A voice asked from behind me, as I tore my eyes away from the painting and I was greeted by a tall, broad shouldered, and well muscled man who’d come up beside me. He had long, messy blond hair and serious features. 

&#x200B;

  “The… technique is incredible,” I replied. He just laughed in response.

  “You don’t like them?” He asked.

  “Not particularly. Too depressing,” I admitted. 

  “That’s fine, you’re not supposed to *like* them, per say. You simply need to feel them.”

  “Well, whoever the artist is, he did a good job with that,” I said.

  “Thank you.”

&#x200B;

I paused, looking up at him again as it clicked in my mind just who I was speaking to.

  “Oh, I’m so sorry! Did you-”

  “It’s perfectly alright! As I said… they are not meant to be liked. Only a true masochist likes suffering,” He said. “Jorge Maestre, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”

  “Landon Laurie,” I replied, offering him a hand to shake. 

&#x200B;

  “Landon Laurie, what a ring that has!” He said, “You know I always liked alliterative names. There’s something so… cinematic, about them! Landon Laurie, now that’s a bombastic name!”

  “So is Maestre,” I said. 

  “I’ve always thought so,” He said. “My father always told me I was destined to do great things and so I try not to disappoint him. Of course, that said I’m not so sure what he’d think of my work. But when one has a skill, one may as well use it.”

  “I suppose that’s true,” I said and forced myself to look at yet another painting. This one was a landscape, although it conveyed a similar sense of desolation to it. It depicted a ship capsized onto its side, its hull rusted beyond repair. A murky gray sky loomed in the background, almost oppressive against the corpse of the ship. 

&#x200B;

  “Ah, this is one of my favorites,” He said. “It’s based off something I saw in a dream once. I’ll admit, I don’t love all of my work but this one… this one I know I did right.”

  “Is that where you get your ideas?” I asked, “Dreams?”

  “Not all of them,” Jorge said as my eyes wandered to the next picture. This one depicted a rusted, run down ferris wheel that was starting to become overgrown with vegetation. It was the brightest of his paintings that I’d seen so far, but even this one held a sense of gloom to it. A shadow of a woman stood at the foot of the ferris wheel, holding a bouquet of flowers as she stared down at a small altar with toys and teddy bears. Even without seeing the womans face… I knew her pain and I knew the story.

&#x200B;

  “This one is inspired by someone I met once,” He said. “She’d lost her son in an accident… I suppose I was imagining her future when I painted this.”

My stomach turned a little bit from the sight of the picture.

  “That’s a… well… that’s an awful gristly thing to imagine,” I said.

&#x200B;

  “Perhaps, but it’s simply what lingered in my mind,” He said. “People are a major source of inspiration for me… particularly unhappy people. The two from the start of my exhibition were also strangers I met once. The man… well, I captured him just the way he was. The girl, I painted the way she would be. She was one of my favorites, actually, I did a few portraits of her.”

  “She was a model?” I asked.

  “No.” His reply was blunt and to the point. 

&#x200B;

He seemed to silently urge me to move on to the next picture and reluctantly, I did exactly that. This one depicted a shiny red bicycle, probably belonging to a child only it lay abandoned on a forest path. Indents in the dirt suggested some kind of struggle. 

There was no sign of the rider.

&#x200B;

  “This one is titled ‘*A Mother’s Nightmare*’” He said, “It was inspired by the son of a friend of mine… I painted her greatest fear.”

  “Why?” I was inclined to ask.

  “It called to me,” Was his response, “I’m not sure why. It simply did.”

He moved on to the next painting, although the moment I saw it, I knew it would be the last. It depicted the same dark haired girl I’d seen in one of the earlier paintings, only now she was hanging lifeless from a noose. Her head hung slightly to the side, and I could have sworn that there was a slight smile on her face. Her empty, vacant eyes held a sense of relief in them. She looked almost happy to be dead.

&#x200B;

I couldn’t look at any more. I felt sick to my stomach. Jorge was looking at me, smiling and silently daring me to continue but I couldn’t.

  “It’s too much for you, isn’t it?” He asked. I didn’t give him an answer.

  “I should really get back,” I said. “My friend is probably looking for me. As I said your technique is… nice.”

  “Oh, who did you come in with?” Jorge asked, not even daring to miss a beat. “I might know them. Just about all of the other artists here are friends of mine… actually… don’t tell me. Let me guess…”

&#x200B;

His intense green eyes locked with mine as he studied me for a moment.

  “You’re with Olivia, aren’t you?” He asked, “She mentioned she wanted one of her students to show some of their pieces here. You must be here student!”

  “Um… yeah,” I said awkwardly. “That’s me…”

&#x200B;

  “Oh, I’ve seen some of your work! Really spectacular stuff! There’s a familiar melancholy to it… a pain that I recognize. You’ve seen some horrible things yourself, haven’t you Landon?”

  “I’d rather not talk about it,” I said, trying to inch away from him.

  “Oh, of course. Of course!” Jorge replied. “Another time, then. Ah, but I should let you go! Olivia is probably missing you. Tell her I’ll be by later! I just have to see her latest landscapes!”

&#x200B;

I gave a hasty nod and took the chance to excuse myself. I looked back only briefly as I left Jorge and his horrible paintings behind, and I saw him turning away from me to go over to another group of people who were staring at some of his other paintings. I saw him putting his arm around a younger man who looked vaguely familiar to me. Jorge kissed him on the head, before whispering something to him and looking back at me.

&#x200B;

Then just like that I was gone.

&#x200B;

I didn’t stay for the rest of the exhibition. I simply told Olivia that I’d be going home early and did exactly that. I still felt sick to my stomach, even when I finally turned in for the night and the feeling hadn’t entirely faded by the time the morning rolled around. 

I hadn’t slept well, although I didn’t remember much about the nightmares that plagued me that night. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

It was a few days before I felt up to painting anything else, and when I did finally have the stomach to set everything up in the little corner of my apartment I’d dedicated to painting, I tried to expunge my questionable experience at the exhibition by throwing something onto the canvas. I don’t know why but it sort of felt nice to do something, anything creative after my uncomfortable encounter with Jorge. 

&#x200B;

I started with a pleasant landscape. Something I made up on the fly. Rolling mountains, lush green bushes, and finally, two people enjoying a campfire. It was just so warm and comfortable that it seemed like the perfect antidote to Jorge’s dreary work. I spent hours working on it, pouring all my misery out onto that canvas and covering it up with something *nice* for no other reason than because it made me feel better.

&#x200B;

It wasn’t my best work, but it did what I needed it to do in every way. I showed the painting off to Olivia when she came by a few days later, and her eyes lit up the moment she saw it.

&#x200B;

  “Oh my God, Landon it’s beautiful!” She said, “Where did you ever get the idea to paint this?”

  “I don’t know, I just sort of felt like it,” I admitted. “I was in a shit mood and… well, this made me feel better.”

  “You should save it for the next exhibition! Jorge is doing one in August!”

&#x200B;

I felt a chill run through me.

  “I think I’ll pass,” I said. “I’m glad I got the opportunity to show my work at an exhibition, but it’s really not for me.”

  “You’re sure?” Olivia asked, raising an eyebrow. “Jorge loved your work! He said that you two had a really interesting conversation too! Oh, I’m so glad that you got to meet him! Isn’t he just something else?”

&#x200B;

  “I guess,” I said. “Honestly I just kinda found him a little creepy.”

  “I mean, he does come off as a bit intense,” Olivia said. “And his work is… grotesque.”

  “Vulgar would be the word I’d use,” I said.

  “Some people think so. I know a few people who think his paintings are prophetic.”

&#x200B;

Now it was my turn to raise an eyebrow.

  “Prophetic?” I repeated.

  “There’ve been a few of his more grotesque paintings that… well… did you see the hanging girl, by any chance?”

  “Unfortunately,” I said. “And I don’t understand why anybody would want to paint something like that.”

  “Well, that’s just it. Jorge always said he paints what he sees in his dreams, or what he sees beneath the surface of people… that particular girl, I heard she died by hanging about a week after he finished that piece.” 

&#x200B;

  “That sounds like a cheap ghost story,” I said. “I’m gonna guess Jorge told it to you?”

  “Heard it from a mutual friend,” Olivia said as if that source was any better. “I mean, I don’t personally put a lot of stock into that kind of thing! But it does make for an intriguing backstory, doesn’t it?”

  “Yes, and I’m sure it drove the price of that painting up quite a bit,” I said. “Look, no offense but you’re sort of making your friend here sound like a grifter using tragedies to promote his work. Even that other picture he showed me… that grieving mother…” The memory of it sent a chill through me. “It just kinda seems like it’s in bad taste.”

&#x200B;

Olivia shrugged.

  “You’re not the first person I’ve heard say that,” She said. 

  “Gee, I wonder why?”

  “I think you’re being a little too hard on him though,” She added. “Jorge may have his flaws… well, alright. He is a bit of a pretentious, phillandering snob whos work is a little too depressing for my tastes. But I promise. He’s completely harmless! Oh! And now that we’re on the subject, he actually wanted me to pass something along to you!”

&#x200B;

Now it was my turn to raise an eyebrow as Olivia reached into her pocket for an envelope. I hesitated for a moment before opening it. Inside was a short letter inviting me to a party of his that weekend.

&#x200B;

I only skimmed it, before crumpling it up and tossing it onto my kitchen table.

  “You can’t be serious,” I said.

  “Oh come on! It’ll be a lot of fun! Jorge’s parties usually are!” Olivia said.

  “Why are you trying so hard to sell this guy to me?” I asked, “What are you, his personal hype squad?”

  “No! I just think it’d be a good opportunity for you!” Olivia said, “Look, Landon you’ve got real talent! I think it’d be good for you to make some connections, or maybe even some new friends! You don’t have to cozy up to Jorge, I promise. But at least give it a shot!”

&#x200B;

I looked over at Olivia, quietly wondering just what her angle might be. It was hard to say if she even had an angle, beyond what she’d told me. And come to think of it, Olivia wasn’t really the kind of person to have any kind of hidden agenda. She generally said what she needed to say and left it at that. After thinking it over for a moment, I finally sighed and gave in.

  “Alright,” I said. “But I get to leave when I want to leave!”

  “I’ll drive you back home myself, scouts honor,” Olivia said and I made a mental note to hold her to that.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I suppose I expected Jorge’s party to be some dark, brooding event, but no. His penthouse bright, open concept and filled with natural light. The people there seemed to be in fairly good spirits too, drinking and chatting amongst each other. The atmosphere was almost pleasant.

&#x200B;

Almost.

&#x200B;

If it weren’t for those paintings on his walls.

&#x200B;

I noticed them the moment I came in, dominating the far wall of his penthouse. They were impossible to miss, standing out against the monochrome gray brick wall they were mounted on. 

&#x200B;

The first one depicted a young brunette woman, with a calm look on her face. She seemed to be working in an office and as far as I could tell her expression betrayed no emotion at all, despite the gun pointed right at her head. Flames erupted from the barrel, turning the painting into a horrible snapshot of the moment before her death. A death she didn’t even seem to see coming…

&#x200B;

The painting beside it was no better. It depicted a young man in a safety helmet, clutching at his face and screaming as fire engulfed him. The look on his face… God… there was an agony there that I can’t even begin to describe with words. His lips were pulled back in a primal scream of pain. His eyes were rolled back into his sockets and you could see them boiling away. The horror of that painting made me lose my appetite. 

&#x200B;

The last painting, set between the other two was thankfully covered and I hoped it would stay that way.

&#x200B;

  “We should say hello to Jorge!” Olivia said, taking my hand. “Just really quickly, okay? We don’t have to chat for long!”

  “Fine,” I said figuring I might as well be a decent guest.

&#x200B;

Jorge was in his kitchen, drinking a glass of red wine with the same young man from the other night on his shoulder. I still couldn’t quite place where I’d seen him before but I was sure it would come back to me eventually. 

&#x200B;

  “So often, I hear people tell me that art is dead…” Jorge was saying, “These… low class troglodites, who somehow came to the conclusion that society is lost, because there’s no new Michaelangelo or Da Vinci work. It’s baffling! There’s still art all around, and yet they act as if it’s invalidated by the existence of that which came before. Beauty stands eternal. It can be found anywhere. Anyone who fails to understand that is depriving a village somewhere of their idiot.”

&#x200B;

Those around him all nodded and hummed in agreement as if he’d just bestowed the greatest wisdom of all time upon them.

  “Oh! Olivia!” Jorge suddenly said, noticing us drawing closer. He pulled away from the boy on his shoulder to pull her into a hug.

  “How are you, my darling!”

  “Same old, same old,” She said. “And you remember Landon, right?”

  “Of course, of course! My dear friend you look dashing tonight! I’m so glad you could make it!”

&#x200B;

The boy who’d been with Jorge was staring at me, his head cocked slightly to the side. I got the feeling that he recognized me too, although he also didn’t seem to be sure where from. I think that his fluffy dark hair and intense eyes reminded me of someone else… although I struggled to remember exactly who.

&#x200B;

  “It’s nice to see you again, Jorge,” I said halfheartedly.

  “I can assure you, the pleasure is all mine,” He said. “I was really hoping you might come tonight. Our conversation at the exhibition left quite an impact on me… something about your eyes… it left me thinking.”

  “Thinking?” I asked, already not liking where this was going.

  “Yes, come. Come along! Let me show you! I completed this yesterday and I think you should be among the first to see it!”

&#x200B;

He reached out to take me by the hand and led me through the throng of his party, toward the covered painting.

  “You reminded me of someone my partner, Yvan told me about. An associate of his fathers and of course it wasn’t long before I made the connection! Such a small world we live in, don’t you think?”

&#x200B;

Jorge smiled at me, oblivious of the impact what he’d just said had just had on me. The pieces in my mind slowly clicked into place as I looked over toward Jorge’s partner Yvan. He was still staring at me, and I felt my blood run cold as I realized exactly who he was.

&#x200B;

We had never met before, nor had I ever seen a picture of him… but he looked just like the spitting image of his father.

&#x200B;

His father…

&#x200B;

Now him, I remembered all too well. 

&#x200B;

Jorge had taken me to the painting by then, too mindlessly excited to show me his work without realizing what it would do to me. Looking at him, I saw no malice in his actions. Nothing spiteful in what he was about to do. He did this because he thought I would appreciate it. It would’ve been thoughtful if it weren’t so mindless.

&#x200B;

  “I only had a faint photograph and Yvan’s description to work off of… but I think I did him justice,” Jorge said as he took the sheet off of the painting and I could not look away from what was in front of me.

The painting depicted a man, staring directly at me. Looking into my soul with his thousand yard stare… and God… Jorge had captured it perfectly.

&#x200B;

It was almost like looking him in the eyes again… and the memories stirred somewhere deep in the back of my mind. The things I wanted to forget. The arrest, the trial, the knowledge that I would have to stand and testify against my own father. The understanding… and the lingering horror that followed.

&#x200B;

I only learned the full extent of his crimes in the courtroom… but even then, I knew they had been bad. I’d always known that my father was a bad man, even if I didn’t want to ever say it out loud.

&#x200B;

But I never knew that he killed kids. I didn’t know that he had shot children in front of their parents, burned houses with the residents still alive and screaming inside, butchered people, sometimes simply maiming them as a warning, other times destroying them completely just to dispose of the bodies. 

&#x200B;

I never knew that my father was a monster.

&#x200B;

They attributed 47 murders to him, and countless other charges. Assault, robbery, arson… the list was too long to remember. Every single crime, committed in service to Yvan Gregorio Sr. 

&#x200B;

The father of Jorge’s boyfriend, and one of the most infamous mob bosses in my city. 

&#x200B;

On the stand, my father had said that he had only done what he’d done to earn money… to provide for me. And for me, he had made a deal with the police. He had given them everything he knew. He had drawn pictures of his victims from memory, and told them where he’d buried the bodies so that they might finally have a chance to take Gregorio down.

&#x200B;

It wasn’t enough of course, and even though my father got a life sentence he never lived to serve so much as one day. Less than a week after he’d testified he was dead. Suicide, they’d said.

&#x200B;

I never believed that.

&#x200B;

Gregorio had left me alone… mostly because I figure that killing me was pointless. My father had kept most of what he did a secret from me. Gregorio knew that. With my father dead, their score was settled… and I was left to sift through the pieces of my life and try to understand what kind of future I had. 

&#x200B;

I’d been doing so well for a while too. Painting had helped me take my mind off of it. It had helped me move on.

&#x200B;

But staring into the lifelike eyes of my dead, murderer of a father every second of time that had passed in the years since his death faded away and the emotions came flooding back raw and painful. I could feel the color draining from my face, as my voice died in my throat.

&#x200B;

Jorge looked at me, watching my reaction carefully, and I’m not quite sure that he fully understood it. He regarded me with a surreal fascination, studying the horror on my face. I knew that he was itching to paint again and I knew what his next painting would be.

  “It’s perfect, isn’t it?” He asked. “It’s perfect!”

&#x200B;

I just looked at him, at a complete and total loss for words. My entire body was shaking… and I knew then that there was nothing I wanted to say to him. I turned, pushing past the other partygoers to get to the door as fast as I could.

  “Landon?” He called after me, “Come back! Wait, come back!”

He tried to follow me, but I was long gone before he could even get close.

&#x200B;

Jorge and I never saw each other again… but I heard plenty about him.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

A week after the party, I saw a news report about an accident at a steel mill in the city. A part had broken, causing molten steel to spill and a man had been caught in its path. 22 year old Jacob Chumley. I saw his photo on the news. I recognized him from one of Jorge’s paintings.

&#x200B;

He was the man who been burning.

&#x200B;

I found the woman who was being shot a few days later. Elizabeth Nutt. Murdered by her ex husband at work. A single gunshot wound to the head.

&#x200B;

Both of the people that Jorge had painted… people he’d probably never even met.

&#x200B;

Dead.

&#x200B;

I wondered if I would be next.

&#x200B;

For a few months, I wondered if Jorge had painted my horrible fate. He’d reached out to me a few times of course. He’d even sent me a letter apologizing for his painting of my father, saying something to the effect of how he did not consider how it might impact me.

&#x200B;

The sentiment was nice… but I’m not really sure I gave much of a damn about it. I simply wanted nothing to do with the man. Not anymore. 

&#x200B;

Then one day, about six months later I saw Jorge’s face in the newspaper.

&#x200B;

The police had apparently discovered his body.

&#x200B;

Jorge had not endured a pleasant death. Not by any stretch of imagination. They left the gorier details out of the newspaper, but I found out about them through Olivia.

&#x200B;

Jorge had disappeared about a week before his body was found, and when they found him, he’d been buried in a wooden box on a farm upstate. I didn’t need to guess who’d killed him. My father had murdered people for Yvan Gregorio Sr. that way a few times before, and it wasn’t that hard to put the pieces together.

&#x200B;

Olivia mentioned that Jorge had a reputation for promiscuity, and about a month before his disappearance had taken another lover. Yvan Sr. probably wasn’t particularly happy to find out that his sons artist boyfriend had a wandering eye, and had dealt with it the only way he knew how.

&#x200B;

I wish I could say that I felt much about Jorge’s death… but really I didn’t. I was unhappy to hear that he was dead, yes. But I can’t really say I mourned him much. Still, as a show of respect, I attended the funeral with Olivia anyways.

&#x200B;

I was there with her at the bar afterward, along with most of his friends who I hardly knew, watching them toast him and drown their sorrows. They had lined up several of Jorge’s paintings for display, and against my better judgment, I let myself look at them.

&#x200B;

They were no less dreary to look at after he was dead… although one, in particular, did catch my eye.

&#x200B;

This one was a self portrait he had done. The date on the canvas said it came from 2005. Like every single other painting he’d created, it was a masterfully done depiction of misery at its finest. Only it was Jorge, not anyone else depicted in it.

&#x200B;

Jorge, surrounded by darkness, screaming in horror, his eyes filled with tears. I stared at it, and felt a final chill run through me, before going back to the bar to get another drink.

&#x200B;

Then I went home, and I painted something meaningless to wash the horrors [away.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)
