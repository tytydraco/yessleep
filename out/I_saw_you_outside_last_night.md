It was my nephews fifth birthday, and I had been pretty much absent the majority of the day. Sitting in my room smoking pot, and playing video games. In turn there's not much to recount of the day prior to the events of that night. Somehow my bother and sisters convinced my mom to let all six of the kids stay over. They all slept on a king size air mattress in the living room all but one, my nephew. He slept on the couch right next to the big window. 

Again I was in my room paying no mind to the outside world. Just stoned and playing some bullshit video game with my buddy Monty. Sometime around three or four AM I got a bit hungry so I snuk into the kitchen to grab a bag of chips. The bag crinkling the entire journey back to my room. After what felt like days I finally make it to the confines of my bedroom. Where I hear laughing coming from my headset. I throw it on to see what's so funny. "Dude there's no fucking way you didn't wake somebody up." Monty snickering through his words. "Bullshit, you heard that bag through the mic" I replied concerned that he may be right. "Not the bag dip shit, the fucking scratching noise." Laughing harder than before. 

"Monty, what scratching noise?" I knew there was no way he heard me, because I was on the opposite end of the house. "Dude what scratching noise?" I interrupted his laughter. He finally started to calm down and reply to me. " It was so loud man, it sounded like you were scratching glass." He was still laughing slightly. "Monty that wasn't me dude. Let me go check on the kids." I took me headset off and sat it down in the floor. Muting it so there was no sound coming from my room. Creeping toward the living room I started to hear it. The sound of glass being rubbed by clammy fingers. 

Approaching the threshold of the hallway the noise is interrupted by the sound of a dog barking, then what sounded like claws on concrete. Sprinting away like a cat that had been spooked. If a cat weighed as much as a bear. I turn the corner and it looks like everyone is still asleep. With that I head back to my room to let Monty know that all is well. " I think I'm gonna hop off for the night. It's like 4:30 and I'm fucking pooped." I yawned feeling like I could drop any second. "Alright buddy I'll see ya tomorrow." Monty Begrudgingly sighed into his mic. "Later bubs." I turned off my console and fell into bed. 

The next day I woke up around early afternoon. In a daze I waddled my way into the kitchen to grab a cup off six hour old coffee and to steal a cigarette from my dad's pack of Marlboro black 100's. On my way outside to smoke said cigarette my nephew walks up to me " I saw you outside last night." He muttered while rubbing his eyes. "You must've dreamed it little buddy I was inside all night." I said holding back concern. " no I saw you, you were like this." Mirroring what he saw. He had his hands raised just above his head, his mouth wide open and his head tilted downward. 

To put it into perspective at the time. I was borderline anorexic and I had just shaved my head. So what he saw was a tall skinny bald figure. That had it's hands pressed on the window. Staring at him with it's mouth wide open.
