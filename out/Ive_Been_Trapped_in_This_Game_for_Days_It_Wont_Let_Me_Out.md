I don’t remember downloading the game. I don’t remember launching it. But at some point, I blinked, and I was inside.

At first, I thought it was just some weird level—low-poly hallways, fluorescent lights humming overhead, a dull beige carpet stretching infinitely beneath my feet. It reminded me of those eerie, empty office spaces you see in dream theory videos. No doors, no windows, just hallways leading into more hallways.

Then I tried to pause.

The menu didn’t appear.

Instead, I saw my own reflection staring back at me, as if my screen had turned into a mirror. My stomach twisted. I pressed the power button. The game did not close.

I tried everything—hard reset, button mash, swiping at the screen like a maniac. Nothing worked. My phone wasn’t running out of charge either. It’s been 87% since I got here. I don’t know how long ago that was.

I thought maybe I just had to keep moving. Maybe there was an exit. But every time I walked through an open doorway, I found myself in a different place.

A grocery store at midnight—fully stocked, completely empty. The aisles stretched longer than they should. I turned a corner, expecting another aisle, but instead—I was in an indoor swimming pool. Stagnant water, pale blue tiles, the sound of distant splashing… but no one was there. I followed the pool’s edge, turned into another hallway, and suddenly—I was inside an abandoned mall.

Every store was locked. The mannequins stood too close to the glass. I heard the soft hum of an escalator running, but no one was on it.

I ran.

I ran until the mall wasn’t the mall anymore. I was in a children’s playplace now—plastic tunnels, netted bridges, the air thick with the scent of old rubber. I climbed through a tube, trying to find my way out, but the openings led nowhere. The slides twisted downward into pure blackness.

I swear I heard something breathing inside them.

Every space bleeds into the next, each one more unsettling than the last. Offices. Parking garages. Public restrooms with the doors slightly ajar. Places that feel abandoned, yet recently used—like I just missed whoever was here before me.

I’ve started noticing changes in the places I revisit. The grocery store aisles are slightly rearranged, with unfamiliar brands I swear didn’t exist before. The mannequins in the mall shift positions when I’m not looking, their blank faces tilted toward me. The indoor pool now has wet footprints leading toward the darkened hallway. Something is watching. Something knows I’m here. And I think it’s getting closer.

The worst part? I still have my phone. I still have WiFi.

I can text people. I’ve messaged my friends, my family, even posted online.

No one replies.

But the messages are marked as read.

I tried calling my own number.

It rang.

I heard my own ringtone—somewhere in the distance.

Closer than it should be.

I ran again, faster this time. My screen lit up with an incoming message. A response.

It was from me.

"Stop moving."
