Today, I'm going to tell you a mysterious story from China's Ailao Mountains in Yunnan province. It's said that a dragon is hidden there. A living dragon!

Last year, when Ailao Mountain first started getting popular online, a lot of people asked me to tell its story. I really wanted to, but I knew absolutely nothing about it. We bloggers have our pride, you know. I can't just spew nonsense like some so-called experts and professors. So, I kept quiet. Besides, I had already promised everyone I’d tell the story of the mysterious man in my neighborhood who raised a giant snake, and the ancient tale of the hidden sect of cultivators in the Taihang Mountains, not to mention the thousand-year-old story of the rooster that gained spiritual powers.

But then, a few days ago, one of my esteemed followers messaged me, urging me to talk about Ailao Mountain. He even said something thrilling: "Tonight, I'm going 'ghost hunting' at a friend's villa!"

This prompted me to finally look into it. I reached out to a few Daoist masters I know and asked them, "What's the real deal with Ailao Mountain? Have any of you ever gone there to exorcise demons?"

They all shook their heads. "The Yunnan-Guizhou area is known for its powerful shamans and a great number of 'Gu' sorceresses," one said. 'Gu' is a type of dark magic involving venomous creatures. "Those folks practice strange arts, dabble in the supernatural, and have peculiar temperaments. Why would a respectable Daoist like me go looking for trouble with them?"

I had to admit, he had a point. I’ve told my fair share of stories about the mysterious 'Gu' sorceresses of that region before.

Then, a Daoist who practices Feng Shui told me that although he’d never been to Ailao Mountain itself, he had assessed the home of a wealthy man who lived nearby. This man had made a fortune in his younger years running with a "big brother" in the *jianghu*—the criminal underworld. He built a large house there to retire. The Daoist said he was on good terms with the man and could ask for me.

"Yes, please!" I said. "That would be fantastic!"

The daoist master made the call. As it turned out, the man was in Beijing at that very moment. His daughter was on summer vacation and wanted to go to Universal Studios. He’d been in the city for a few days and was complaining that Beijing felt even more humid than Yunnan. He was itching to get out for a "wild drink."

I eagerly agreed. "Don't you worry," I told him, "I guarantee the drinks will be wild!"

I procured a jar of homemade fruit wine from a painter friend of mine who lives as a hermit in the mountains. For an extra kick, I mixed in some Maotai, ensuring it was plenty strong. I then booked a guesthouse near Yanqi Lake in Huairou, a place with a pool and fishing, and invited his whole family for a two-day stay. All I asked in return was for him to tell me the stories of Ailao Mountain.

The man, being from the *jianghu* himself, appreciated the gesture. He felt I had shown him great respect. He let his wife and daughter enjoy the amenities while he sat down with me for a drink. "Ask whatever you want," he said. "I'll tell you everything I know."

"I mainly want to ask about Ailao Mountain," I said.

He paused, then laughed. "Ailao Mountain, huh? I'm actually not that familiar with it!"

I thought he was being coy, but he waved his hand dismissively. "It's probably a misunderstanding. It's true I built a big house near Ailao Mountain, but it wasn't for me. It was for my big brother. He's from there."

"So where is your big brother now?" I asked.

His expression darkened. "He's been missing for many years. The only reason I built that house was to wait for him."

Seeing the look in his eyes, I knew there was a deep story there, but I didn't want to pry. I just poured him another drink. The weather was suffocatingly hot, the air so damp you could wring water from it. "Damn, this climate really reminds me of Ailao Mountain," he remarked.

"You've been inside the mountains?" I asked.

He shook his head. "No. I only ever waited for my big brother outside. He would go in for a week at a time and bring something out. That's how we made our living." He saw my curious glance and chuckled. "It wasn't drugs! It was tea. We were in the tea business. The best aged tea you can find."

I breathed a sigh of relief. "I had no idea Ailao Mountain produced tea."

"Of course it does! The best sweet oranges in all of Yunnan are from there. That's where the famous entrepreneur Chu Shijian started his 'Chu Oranges' brand."

"So it's a place with good Feng Shui, a treasure land?"

"Treasure land, my ass!" he scoffed. "That place is evil. The locals say it's cursed—the forbidden land of the Dragon King, where the living are not meant to enter. They say no one who goes in ever comes out alive."

"Then how could your big brother go in?" I pressed.

"My big brother... he's different. He was originally from Ailao Mountain."

I was confused.

He explained, "My big brother is from Shiyakou Village." Seeing my blank stare, he pulled out his phone and sent me a link. It was a program from CCTV, China's state broadcaster, about the mysterious deaths in Shiyakou Village.

Shiyakou Village was a settlement of the Yi ethnic group near Ailao Mountain. In the 1990s, many villagers suddenly began to die of unknown causes. Experts investigated multiple times but could only offer a weak conclusion that the local water quality was to blame. After that, people in the village continued to die mysteriously until the government had no choice but to relocate the entire community.

His big brother was from that very village.

"Was the CCTV report just sensationalism?" I asked. "Did those bizarre deaths really happen?"

"They did," he confirmed.

"Then why did they die?"

"I asked my big brother about it once," he said, "but it was a taboo subject for him. He never gave me a straight answer. But sometimes, when we were drinking, he’d let a few things slip. Over the years, I've pieced together a theory. I can't say it's the truth, but it's my own guess. To explain, I have to start from the beginning, from when I first met him."

And so, he began his story.

"I'm from Hunan, born in the 70s," he started. "People of my generation lived through the whole wave of China's 'Reform and Opening-Up.' It was a time of great change, a gold rush that produced many heroes. I certainly wasn't one of them. I had no education and was a hot-headed kid who liked to fight. My family was poor, so I left home early to make my way in the

*jianghu*. I went to Changsha, then Fujian, and finally ended up in Guangdong, where everyone said the money was."

"I was in Houjie, a town in Dongguan, working as a bodyguard for a Hong Kong businessman. Back then, many Hong Kong investors set up factories and kept mistresses there. This guy was a triad member in Hong Kong, pretty high up, connected to a movie mogul. Most of the old-generation filmmakers in Hong Kong had ties to the criminal underworld. Movies were a convenient way to launder money, support underlings, and bribe officials. Many movie stars were even forced to sleep with high-ranking officials."

"When this Hong Konger came to the mainland, he took a liking to me because I could fight and was loyal. He had me act as his bodyguard, but my real job was to watch over his mistress. She was only fifteen years old, just a girl. One day, she knelt before me, begging. She told me she was a migrant worker who had been coerced and imprisoned by him. She pleaded with me to let her go home."

"I let her go. Then I knelt, ready to accept my punishment. The Hong Konger, following the triad code, had me tied up and was about to give me the 'three stabs, six holes'—a punishment where you're stabbed three times clean through. But just then, a young man arrived to deliver something in a small handbag. The Hong Konger immediately dropped the knife, took his men to greet the young man, grabbed the bag, and rushed back to Hong Kong. He said it was something his own 'big brother' valued greatly and he had to deliver it first. He promised to deal with me when he returned."

"After he left, the young man untied me and told me to run for my life. I refused to leave, afraid I would bring him trouble. He just smiled and said, 'Don't worry, he wouldn't dare cross me.' I still didn't believe him. Finally, he said, 'Fine, then you can come with me.' From that day on, I followed him. I became his little brother for life. That young man was the big brother who later disappeared."

"I later found out that my big brother was in the tea business. He only dealt in one kind of tea: top-grade Pu'er. He didn't sell it on the open market; it was all reserved for exclusive clients. These clients were the wealthiest tycoons in Hong Kong—the Casino King, the Shipping Magnate, the Rubber Tycoon, the Movie Mogul, they were all his customers."

"At first, I didn't get it. I asked him, 'There's so much Pu'er tea out there. Why do they insist on buying yours?'"

"He just replied faintly, 'What they're buying isn't tea. It's life.'"

"I thought about the old saying, 'Aged tea is like medicine.' I knew that old, fermented tea was believed to have medicinal properties, but I had never heard of it being described as life itself. But it wasn't my place to understand. All I had to do was follow him."

"My big brother was a mysterious man. He rarely went out and preferred to stay in some small, obscure town, sometimes in the northeast, sometimes in Yunnan. He would rent a small place and spend his days drinking tea and reading. He had no interest in women or alcohol, had no family or friends. It was just him, his books, and his tea, with an occasional word for me. He never drank Pu'er himself, only the local, cheap 'big bowl' tea. He didn't care what kind it was."

"Once a year, before the Qingming Festival, we would go into the mountains to pick tea. The mountain we entered was Ailao Mountain."

"That was the most solemn event of our year. We had to bathe and burn incense beforehand to pray for the Dragon God's protection. My big brother would get a dragon tattooed on his back, dress in all black from head to toe, put on a big red scarf, and carry a leather suitcase into the mountains. He would be gone for half a month. That half-month was always the hardest. He forbade me from going with him; he always went in alone. I would wait for him just outside the mountain's edge. Thankfully, after two weeks, he would always reappear on schedule, the suitcase full of tea leaves. But he would be extremely weak, his face as pale as a corpse, as if he had lost a massive amount of blood. That one suitcase of tea would sell for a fortune, enough for us to live comfortably for a year."

"I asked him if he wanted me to go in with him, to help out. He always shook his head and said, 'It wouldn't matter how many people there were. Ailao Mountain is a prison, the forbidden domain of the dragon. The living are not meant to enter.'"

"I never understood what he meant by that. I did my own research on Ailao Mountain. It's not a single peak but a vast, continuous range with treacherous terrain and a diverse climate. The canopy is so dense that it blocks out the sun, and the forest is filled with wild beasts, disorienting fog, and poisonous miasma. It's a truly dangerous primeval forest. The name 'Ailao' comes from the Dai language, 'Ai Long,' which can be translated as 'the center,' meaning 'the central kingdom.' In ancient texts, it was known as the 'Kingdom of the Elephant Riders.'"

"In the northern section of Ailao Mountain, where the prefectures of Pu'er and Chuxiong meet, hidden within the vast wilderness, is a massive cluster of ancient tea trees known as the 'Ailao Mountain Wild Tea Tree Grove.' I figured that's where my big brother picked his tea. But why he called it the 'forbidden domain of the dragon,' I had no idea."

"Once, while I was waiting for him outside the mountain, I met a man from Henan who was in the mineral business. He told me that Ailao Mountain was called the 'central kingdom' because it held a treasure, an absolutely immense treasure. I thought he was talking about the gold bars hidden by the last local chieftain, Tusi Li Runzhi, but he just scoffed. 'That's nothing,' he said. 'These mountains *are* gold. There are gold mines in there.' (This guy later scammed a huge amount of money to try and start a mining operation here and was eventually arrested)."

"I asked my big brother about it later. 'Are there really gold mines in there?' He nodded and said, 'There are.' I got excited. 'Then why are we still picking tea? Why don't we just dig for gold?'"

"My big brother's face turned serious. 'The gold here cannot be touched. Whoever touches it dies.'"

"He told me that as a local, he grew up with the ancient legend that a dragon's nest was hidden deep within Ailao Mountain. The nest was supposedly located inside a massive fissure in the mountain, and the entrance to this nest was also the entrance to the gold mine. Inside, it was filled with glittering gold nuggets and all the gems the dragon had collected over thousands of years."

"I couldn't help but say, 'That's just a myth. We have lots of stories like that in Hunan. It's all nonsense!'"

"My big brother cut me off coldly. 'I've been to the dragon's nest.'"

"I froze, staring at him in disbelief."

"He continued, 'I was just a boy. A group of people came to our village with official letters, claiming to be geologists from Beijing. They wanted to hire some locals to help them survey the Ailao Mountains. The village sent a few of us, and I was one of them. That group wasn't geologists. They had mercenaries, Feng Shui masters, and hunters. They went into the mountains to find the dragon's nest.'"

"'Did they find it?' I asked."

"He nodded."

"'Was it really full of treasure?'"

"He nodded again."

"'So they carried all the treasure out?'"

"He shook his head. 'They all died.'"

"'Why?'"

"'Because the dragon,' he said, 'is still alive.'"

"I didn't know what to think. Was he speaking in metaphors, or was he saying there was a literal dragon in there? I had so many more questions. How did he get out alive? Were the mysterious deaths in his village connected to that treasure hunt? And what was the secret of the tea? But my big brother wouldn't say more, and I didn't dare to ask."

"Years passed. Then one day, one of our biggest clients, a top Hong Kong tycoon, sent people to find us. My big brother talked with them for a long time, and the meeting ended on a sour note. I asked him what was wrong. He said, 'A powerful man in Hong Kong is dying. He wants us to provide more tea.' I said, 'Well, let's just pick more then.' My big brother shook his head. 'I can only gather so much on my own. If I take more, I won't be able to come out.'"

"I asked him again, 'Can't I go with you? That way we could harvest more!' He just sighed. 'It's not that simple. Every blade of grass, every stone in that place, is paid for with a life.' I didn't understand what he meant."

"Later, the Hong Kong tycoon came to see us himself. This time, they talked for a very long time. He pleaded and reasoned with my big brother, who finally, reluctantly, agreed. The tycoon sent a large team of people to go into the mountains with him. (But my big brother still wouldn't let me go, telling me to wait outside as always)."

"This time, he was in the mountains for a full month before I saw him again. And just like always, only he came out alive. He brought back a lot of tea. The Hong Kong tycoon paid us a huge sum of money. My big brother split the money in two and gave me one share. 'From now on, let's go our separate ways,' he said. 'Don't look for me. Just pretend that I'm already dead.'"

"I refused."

"He sighed deeply. 'I am an unlucky person. I should have died in that dragon's nest long ago. I overstepped my bounds, and now I will only cause more deaths. It's better for me to just disappear.' I still didn't understand."

"So he told me a story."

"'There was once a king who loved to climb mountains. He vowed to conquer every high peak. One day, he came to a massive, treacherous snow-capped mountain that he could not summit. It was too high and the path too steep; only one person could ascend at a time. If a climber carried too much food, they would be too heavy to climb. If they carried too little, they would starve to death. Then, someone came up with an idea: the king would take a very large team with him. In the end, the king successfully reached the summit. But of the entire expedition, he was the only one who came down alive. After descending, the king announced he would never climb another mountain again.'"

"After finishing the story, my big brother turned and left without looking back. I never saw him again. I suspect he went back into Ailao Mountain for good. That's why I built the house at the foot of the mountain. Every year around the Qingming Festival, I go and stay there for a few days, waiting for him to come out."

"Maybe he'll never return. Or maybe, he'll come back tomorrow."
