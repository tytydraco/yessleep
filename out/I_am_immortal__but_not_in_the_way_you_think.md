It was supposed to be a joke.

We used to play with "the spirits" - doing things like drawing letters on the sand with questions, and wait for some hours to see if there was going to be an answer - painted some letters on some wooden board, try to get answers; it was all meant to be a joke, but we did it anyway.

My friends mostly grew out of it. Me and a girl that I think I liked - it was a long time ago, mind you - decided to keep trying. Well, to "keep pushing" maybe explains a little bit better - we found "cursed places" and "haunted houses" and "powerful places", none actually did anything for us.

Until one day that we, frustrated about some "wishing well", decided to draw on the sand at its side. She drew something like "I want to visit the other world" and I just said "I want to be immortal so I can investigate more things". We left for our hotel at night, and I remember that a huge storm fell over the place. We kinda joked that our messages would be bathed by the well's waters and that maybe would make our wishes come true...

... we shouldn't have joked. She was dead the next morning. Nobody found the cause, and obviously I was the primary suspect. Even when I was cleared of any suspicion, my friends, her and my family, well, everyone that met us both basically declared me guilty. That was the first time I tried to kill myself.

And I failed. I tried to hang myself on a tree (I was young, never knew that it was going to hurt so much) before a storm. Yes, it was a teenager-ish thing to do, but I was specially sad, and the thunderstorms and bleak sky color were _not helping at all_. A huge thunderbolt hit the tree, that fell over a house. I broke four bones, and killed two people.

Over the time, every time I tried to die met the same destination - somebody jumping in front of a bullet that was going to hit me; overdosing medicine and somehow paramedics just found me just before the effects were irreversible; bought a gun, tried to hit myself on the head, and the gun failed...

The worst, probably, was when I tried to jump from a plane. I made everything the best I could - took some paragliding classes, rent one for me, did lots of jumps just to convince people I wasn't going to do something stupid, and at the day I finally decided to stop everything, I just cut the ropes on the parachute and boarded the plane... just for it to malfunction as soon as we were on the air.

The crash was horrible - everyone, except for me, died. And I got hospitalized for months, had to re-learn how to walk, and up to this day, I still am not fully recovered.

Turns out, I found, that the deal was just to stay _alive_ - not _well_. I still have huge headaches from the last time I almost died, for example, and I don't know if they will ever go away; I am missing one arm, too... but still alive.

I found out that this curse would _always be with me_ so I distanced myself from everyone. Found a quiet place to die, and lived there, peacefully.

... well, until war broke. I became a prisoner of war, and I have to say, they tested a lot of horrible things with me; they found my immortality by accident where my body kept rejecting and somehow surviving everything they tried to put on me. The hypothermia tests were the worst, but luckily all researchers died in a fire that spread up to the whole building, killing them but avoiding me to die (of course, I still have several burns from that accident). And, **of course** I was rescued - by some higher division whatever-the-hell these guys were. They tested some drugs on me... something related to "avoid DNA breaking" or whatever - I am not a scientist. They were excited when the testing gave the results they wanted - I was not aging anymore.

And of course, I was (and still am) horrified - things straight up from science fiction were now happening, just to prolong my suffering! They decided to try on themselves, and obviously I wasn't going to be the one to tell them the side-effects... none survived. Of course, why would they? It's hard to survive when your body literally sweat blood...

... and how did **I** survive? Well, they threw me away on the streets where this happened, and I was found by some medics. _Of course_ they had just the right equipment to prevent me from dying... anyway, long story short - I began to age again, and again I was found, homeless, by some billionaire that still thinks he can cheat death and that is paying a lot of money so that government turns a blind eye to his "medical procedures", so to speak.

Don't be fooled - this happens **everywhere**. Trust me, I tried almost every country in the world. There are people that you don't even know that exist, and they can do things that you don't even imagine. For me, this means that they will always have someone to experiment, and it'll always have the intended result - I accepted that I can't die.

But they don't know it. Nobody knows. Because, as soon as I found myself cornered, like a lab rat that can't ever escape, I find a way to trigger my curse.

At my life, there's only one thing that's certain: I cannot die. So if I try, the universe will find a way to save me. Even these "untouchables" can't escape my curse, and if they _dying_ is the only way to save me... that's what it was going to be...

The last one was horrible. I still have headaches because of that horrible "brain chip" they implanted me to reverse what I basically think is my brain dying. A bullet to the head fortunately _just hit the chip_ - as always - and I was hurried to some emergency hospital, when they congratulated me for the "miraculous survival". Yeah, sure.

Of course, the billionaire that did this will escape punishment - and he will try again. It always happens. So I am hacking this account to tell you, and others that are still searching, that think you can do whatever you want with me: stay away. Don't try to find me.

If you do... you will die. But don't be sad, or mad, for it - you're the lucky one.

You don't want to be immortal. Trust me. I get nightmares thinking how will I survive, after everyone is gone...
