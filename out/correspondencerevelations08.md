**Holly Hill Hospital**

Raleigh, North Carolina

919-XXX-XXXX

..

Dr. Anne Hardwick

Patient: Amanda Cooper

..

**Doctors Notes**

Amanda continues to reject the therapy. Her delusions have gotten much worse and she has become violent. I am requesting that she be transferred to Doctor Derek Hunt who has more experience in dealing with violent patients. 

*Please note that the patient has not been responding to conventional methods.* I will attach my notes and transcriptions.

**Amanda:** Who are all those people in my room?

**Dr. Hardwick:** Those are the nurses. They're here to help you.

**Dr. Hardwick:** Amanada, honey, how are you feeling today?

**Dr. Hardwick:** Amanda?

**Amanda:** What is that?

**Dr. Hardwick:** This here?

**Amanda:** Yes.

**Dr. Hardwick:** It's a recorder. Remember we discussed recording our sessions?

**Amanda:** Turn it off.

**Dr. Hardwick:** Are you sure? Why don't we give it a try and see how it goes. If you're still feeling uncomfortable, I'll turn it off. What do you say?

**Amanda:** Fine.

**Dr. Hardwick:** So how have you been?

**Amanda:** Do you really care? 

**Dr. Hardwick:** I do.

**Amanda:** I've been fantastic. Fucking fantastic.

**Dr. Hardwick:** I'm sorry, Amanda, I just want to make sure you're handling the transition well.

**Amanda:** I know what you're doing here. You're not fooling anyone.

**Dr. Hardwick:** I'm sorry?

**Amanda:** He sent you. If you try anything, I'll fucking kill you.

**Dr. Hardwick:** I'm not lying.

**Amanda:** Ross.

**Dr. Hardwick:** Who's Ross?

**Amanda:** MEYER! ROSS - FUCKING - MEYER! Get out! Get out of my room!

**Dr. Hardwick:** Amanda, I promise you no one sent me. This is my office, you're safe here. Would you like to go back to your room? If you're not feeling like cooperating today then maybe we can try again tomorrow. 

**Dr. Hardwick:** Is that what you want, Amanda?

**Dr. Hardwick:** Amanda?

**Amanda:** Where am I?

**Dr. Hardwick:** You're in my office.

**Amanda:** This is my house! You came here!

**Dr. Hardwick:** Amanda, we talked about this.

**Amanda:** MOM!

**Dr. Hardwick:** Is your mom here?

**Amanda:** Of course she is. You're in her fucking house! 

**Dr. Hardwick:** How has your mom been?

**Amanda:** Ask her yourself, she's right behind you.

**Dr. Hardwick:** Well hello Miss Cooper. Can she hear me?

**Amanda:** She doesn't like you.

**Dr. Hardwick:** Are you sure? I think your mom and I would get along great. Is she willing to give me another chance?

**Amanda:** No.

**Dr. Hardwick:** Well I [Amanda interrupts] 

**Amanda:** She wants me to kill you.

**Dr. Hardwick:** Amand.. [Amanda interrupts]

**Amanda:** Leave now before you get hurt.

**Amanda:** NOW!

**Dr. Hardwick:** Well it's obvious this isn't working today, Amanda, so I'm going to send you back to your room and we can do this again tomorrow.

**Amanda:** [Screaming]

**Dr. Hardwick:** Amanda sit down!

**Dr. Hardwick:** Amanda!

[Glass shatter]

**Dr. Hardwick:** Stop it! Help!

Derek,

I haven't heard from you regarding the transfer request and Amanda is no longer in her room. Did you have her relocated? You better not hurt her, Derek! I'll kill you, do you hear me?! I'll kill you! Don't hurt my little girl!

**Good Story**

Awesome job with the story man, I'm really enjoying it. I know you don't typically respond to people on here, but if you could just respond to me, I'd appreciate it. There has been some strange occurances this past month that coincide with when I started reading your stories. There has 2 attempted break in's at around 4 am and my daughter keeps telling me that she's seeing a woman in our yard. I know it's a probably a huge coincidence, but if you could just ease my mind a bit, I'd appreciate it. Thanks and keep it up!

**You Crazy Bastard**

Dude, I love you. This shit is really hitting close to home though. My girlfriend mentioned in passing that there was an elderly woman on our porch last night. There is a good chance she's fucking with me since my laptop has your stories bookmarked and she probably just stumbled on it. In any case, I'm scared shitless and I love you for that. I can't remember the last time a story on nosleep kept me up at night.

**Amazing Story Yields an Important Question**

I will admit to feeling a rush of excitement whenever I see that you have put a new post up. The longevity and ongoing superb storytelling that your posts hold is amazing. But I have to ask if there may be some truth to this story. Sparked by curiousity the other night, I decided to do some research on Hell House, and found that much of the information in your stories is accurate. While researching, though, I looked up and could have sworn that I had seen a person standing in my backyard, which was unusual for a number of reasons; first off, it was near three in the morning, and most people in my town are asleep by then, second, my backyard is completely fenced in, by a 7 foot fence, mind you, so that makes it more strange that someone may have been back there. Naturally, I looked the fuck away and stared intently at my computer screen until I felt safe enough to flee to my bed and cower under the blankets. This could have been just a coincidence, but I would still like to know if your stories are just that, stories, or if they're legit.
