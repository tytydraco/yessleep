At the time of writing this it's been a day and a half since i, and two others, found ourselves in an apartment building that seems to have no end. However by the time you're reading this it may be later than that. My new neighbors, Nikolai Radovanović, Ji-Hye Park, and myself are only a few hours from descending down the infinite staircase to see if we can hit ground or at the very least how many floors are between us and the lobby. Ji pointed out that there are about thirty buttons in the elevator, and said that she has been in buildings that have thirty floors. It never takes that long to go from the top floor to the bottom. So it stands to reason that there are more floors between us and the lobby. And so we are going down to find out how many floors there are. 

This is our plan: we will stock up on supplies from our various apartments, depending on how fast the elevator was going it might take us a day to get to the lobby. We will open any door we find to see if there are any other non-residential floors like the lobby between here and there. Once we reach the lobby we will resupply and begin going down. This could legitimately take days to accomplish, and there's no telling what's down there or what we could encounter. The whole thing is pretty exciting actually.

I slept for a little while last night but honestly I wasn't able to get much. You're no doubt wondering why we don't take the elevator floor by floor. Well, Ji pointed out that there are only about 24 buttons in the elevator. It wouldn't take an elevator several hours to get to the lobby, that has to mean there are more than just the 24 listed. We're gonna count the whole way down.

This place is weird, weirder than I had initially thought. I talked it over with Ji and she also is losing her memory of life before we were here. Nikolai is a little less forthcoming but he probably can't remember much either. Truth be told when I went to sleep I remembered my life before this apartment but now… it's all just the apartment. I can't remember a life outside of it, I have memories of a memory. Like a puzzle missing the final piece. I know there was something there once but it's gone. I wonder now, while I'm writing this, what is tomorrow gonna make me forget? My name? Where I come from? I already forgot my hometown, I know I'm from Wyoming somewhere… or Montana (one of the two)..

To tell you the truth when I was writing that first entry I didn't know for sure it would reach anyone but. looking at it now I can see it got through so that's cool! And thank you for the 15 upvotes. I don't remember what those are or what they're for but I'm choosing to interpret them as a good thing. It makes me feel a little calmer to know people out there know about us, they know we are gone and not at home. I think this place might be some kind of cosmic closet where stuff gets put when you have too much. Nikolai thinks this is all some kind of test by the Serbian government, and this is all being televised by the rich and powerful people back in Serbia. It sounded plausible at first but then ji raised a good point. If that's the case why are a Korean woman and American man with him? 

In any case we are only a few short hours away from embarking down the stairs. There's a part of me there incredibly excited for this. I feel like an explorer or a pioneer about to set my eyes on a part of the world that's never been seen before. But then again there's no telling what it's gonna be like when I get out of here so I might end up feeling like that everywhere with everyone and everything. My memories are genuinely fading fast and, not to put too much emphasis on it, that's freaking me out a fair amount. 

Now we are camping out in a department store. It's dark outside now. We left when the sun was still rising. All together we counted about 52 floors on our way down. The floors have a repeating pattern of four residential floors, then a store of some kind, then four more residential floors, then a “special” floor. This has been the pattern we've seen with every door we've opened. Nikolai is despondent. He's kind of losing it. Ji and I are staying sane, but only just barely. We already knew that we'd be seeing more floors than were listed. But something about the knowledge of it vs the reality is truly mind boggling. 

We saw floors that shouldn't be in an apartment complex. One floor would be a living history museum with no one in it, four down would be a gas station from rural America, then four more down we'd come across a forest, like an actual living breathing forest. All these floors were confined entirely within the building itself; the walls didn't disappear or anything. So that's one of the things I'm using to ground myself. 

Assuming that the whole place functions on a similar plane of logic then there has to be an end to this complex, right? 

I'm writing this as I go, so a lot of things might sound disjointed or convoluted in some way. 

The next day, we've traversed the remaining steps and walked into as many floors as we could. I lost count. Even though I had the final count written down, it's a blur to me. Literally. The paper got wet when we visited a pool floor. Like the whole floor was a pool with only one strip of floor to walk on. What I know for sure is that the pool floor is right above the lobby. Which is, of course, where we are now. 

Two days of going down stairs, it's ridiculous and almost comical in a way. Yesterday we were so focused on getting to the lobby that we glanced past the weird shit we saw. Reading back, I remember we saw a whole ass forest INSIDE this building. Today we saw a  store in Serbia. This is when we decided it would be a good idea to investigate further. 

Nikolai said he recognized the store and said it was absolutely a store he visited often back in his hometown. Going inside revealed that the store was only stocked in some Serbian candies and chips, as well as beer, energy drinks, bottles of water, and more beer; which I thought was odd. So I pointed it out. Nikolai said it was fine because everything that was stocked was the stuff he usually got when he was there anyway. 

There was a back door to the store and out of curiosity ji and I went through it. There was a street, like a whole street, I know it was an optical illusion but damn. Like I stepped outside that store and I said, audibly, “that's a whole street.”

“This is in Seoul…” Ji said. There was an apprehensive tone she took when she spoke. “There's this store… this store!” She said pointing to a small building. She hurries inside and we found a handful of snacks, drinks, some painkillers, beer, soju… it was a lot more comprehensive than Nikolai’s. 

Ji took some time gathering up some supplies and I left the store. At this point I knew what to expect, and if you've been paying attention so do you. The last store we came across was one I was familiar with. I stepped out of the store and saw a Conoco sign. Stepping inside the coolers will full of Red bulls, Budweisers, Pabst, Coors, and occasionally a Pepsi or two. The shelves were virtually empty, just some KitKats, snickers, and condoms. It went without saying but this store was mine. 

I think at this point it's fairly obvious to say that I didn't fully remember anything of coming to a store like this one. Nor did Nikolai, or Ji. But I have a theory. I don't think these stores are 1 to 1 recreations of convenience stores we had visited, but instead these were a type of shim, or facade, used to put us at ease and everything inside was just stuff we had always gone in for. I've never bought benadryl from a convenience store so why would a store built strictly for me have any? Why would a store for Nikolai have anything more than candy, chips, and beer. Most importantly, how often does Ji go out for her store to be so well stocked? I thought about asking her about this but decided against it ultimately. Eventually we left. We gathered what we could from each store and then, for shits and giggles mostly, we decided to follow the street until we couldn't anymore. 

It didn't take very long at all. The street was the same length as the rest of the floors we had seen. But something was wrong about it. At the end of the street was a roadwork ahead sign, but it was the last three dimensional object within the space. Everything else was an elaborate mat painting that gave the singular illusion that the street kept going. It was a good effect, I admit, I had to put my hand on the wall to fully realize that it didn't actually extend. I could feel the rise and falls of the paint, where the brush had made contact and where it stopped to reload the paint. It was all so surreal I mean, I was touching it. I was touching it with my hand. I felt how flat it was, how two dimensional it was, purely printed on that plaster and lathe wall it was and yet it wasn't. I was like I could have stepped through the painting into the street and followed it as far as it could go. To the main road, to the highway, to the interstate and as far away from this place as I could get. It was enough to drive a man mad…

Then I stopped thinking about it when I found a vhs tape just kind of in the corner of the wall. So naturally I picked it up and slipped it into my backpack. No one knew I had it until we got to the lobby. Once we were there and getting ready to bed down for the night the tape fell from my bag. Nikolai saw it first and scooped it up. 

“What's this?” He asked, almost accusingly, 

I shrugged “some video tape from the store floor. I was wondering if we could watch it but then realized that there probably wasn't a VHS player in this bitch.”

Ji took it from my hands and tapped it on her leg as she looked around “well. We might be able to find something. Come on, it doesn't hurt to look.” 

For the next few hours we wandered around the lobby, it's actually much bigger than I thought it was with rooms and sub-rooms and closets in closets. Eventually we found a kind of board room with an old crt TV, the kind that had the VHS player right in it. Without much forethought or fanfare we settled into the board room and slipped the tape into the player. With all of us pulling up chairs and scooting the table out of the way we clustered together with snacks and drinks to watch the mysterious tape. It's just about to begin. Apparently there was some setting that was wrong that took Nikolai and Ji working together to figure out. But they got it. I might tell you what's on the tape, I might not. We'll see.

Edit: holy cow! It's been more than a day or two since I uploaded the first one. I genuinely have no idea how time works here. But hey we're gonna figure it out.
