While gathering the flyers from the printer, I stayed on edge. Every sound in the house felt louder than it should have been. The hum of the machine wasn’t just noise anymore, it was crawling under my skin.

Then I heard a scream.

My sister.

I sprinted toward the living room, grabbing my gun off the kitchen counter as I passed. She was on the couch, folded in on herself, sobbing so hard she could barely breathe. I wanted to go to her, to tell her it was okay, but my training kicked in. Stay vigilant. Stay alert.

“What happened?” I asked, moving toward the window.

I peeled the blinds open just enough to see outside. Nothing. Just the soft yellow of the streetlights bleeding across the lawn. I checked the locks on the doors and windows. Everything was still secure.

She could barely get the words out, her voice shaking between each breath. But I heard her.

“I saw a flash. Someone took a picture. Outside the window.”

I told my sister to call 911 and not to move.

I stepped outside, gun drawn, scanning the yard. Nothing. No movement, no footprints, no sign anyone had been there.

I approached the bay window of the living room. Still nothing.

Just as I started to catch my breath and turn back toward the house, a blinding light hit me.

The flash of a camera.

Before I could react, my head slammed against the glass.

I heard my sister scream.

Her voice faded into static.

When I came to, she was still screaming my name. Lights and sirens echoed off what was left of the window.

“Stay down! An ambulance is on the way!”

“I’m fine!” I shouted, trying to stand.

I wasn’t fine. My vision was blurred. Blood was running down my face, and my legs barely held me.

I tried to hide the pain, but then I saw it. Lying next to me on the ground.

A photo.

It was me, right before the attack.

I should have given it to the detective. It was evidence, after all.

But this wasn’t just a case anymore. It was personal.

If anyone was going to find my niece, if anyone was going to find the monster doing this to us, it was going to be me.

The EMTs started working on me, but I told them I wasn’t going to the hospital. They tried to insist, but that ended fast once they realized I wasn’t changing my mind.

After the officers and the detective finished questioning us and taking our statements, they told us to spend the night somewhere else.

Both of our houses were off limits now. They didn’t feel like ours anymore.

We didn’t feel safe.

My niece, her daughter, was still missing.
And the bastard who did all of this was playing games with us.

We got a hotel room just before sunrise. I sat on the edge of the bed and reached into my pocket. The photo was still there. I stared at my own shocked face, trying to think, trying to make sense of it, but my head was still too foggy to string a thought together.

I turned the photo over.

Three words were written on the back.

She is perfect.
