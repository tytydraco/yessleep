I awoke to an ear piercing shriek reverberating through my ear canal, bouncing repeatedly on my eardrum until it eventually penetrated through to my skull. The sound was something I’d never encountered before, fighting its way to infiltrate every inch of my frame; punching through my veins until a scream of my own eventually escaped me.

In a similar fashion to a predatory animal running for their next prey, I leapt from my bed in an attempt to find the source of the animalistic noise. My body moved of its own accord, adrenaline racing my legs to Ophelia’s room, my mind tracing steps behind.

The shrieking became louder and louder until it blended into one continuous note creating a torturous melody. I felt a wet, sticky substance roll down the side of my face.

Blood. 

As I reached my hand to investigate its origin, I noticed it was seeping from my own ear. As it began pouring faster and faster down my cheek, I threw myself into my baby daughter’s bedroom.

I ground to a halt as i entered her room, my eyes darted back-and-forth; wide and afraid, praying to find the source of the noise.
That’s when I noticed… As my scanning eyes landed on the crib sat by the window. 
I noticed that my baby was gone.

———

My knees buckled underneath me, plummeting me to the ground. In that moment I felt as though time had stopped but the world was still rotating around me, throwing itself in a spinning motion as I lay in the centre of the room, nothing but a mass of shaking bones and twitching muscles,
aching for mind to comprehend what I was seeing.

Suddenly, the shrieking transitioned into a whirring chime, like a haunted whistle; endearing yet dangerous. Through the preternatural sound, a voice called my attention. 
speaking in more of a hiss than decipherable words, the voice beckoned  “come find us”.

I snapped into consciousness and turned towards my room, throwing on whichever clothes I could reach first, glancing at my clock I saw the time read 2:54 am. Breathless and determined I left the comfort of my home with one goal in mind: find my baby.

———

As I cried out for my baby, the shrieking was a continuous whirring in my ears, increasing in intensity as I neared the forest behind my house,  like a twisted game of Marco Polo that I was blindly following. 
Even the forest itself seemed to be trying to communicate with me, the tree branches twisting and wrapping around themselves, creating creaking and snapping noises which loudened as I headed deeper.

I charged through the thick forest, pulling my tired legs through trails of dirt, not caring for the mass wildlife destruction I was creating in my wake. 

The noise guided me off the trail of the normal forest paths,  forcing me to climb through overgrown wildlife which was determined to not allow me to pass. Branches curling around my feet causing me to fall and flies swarming my face, creating a mask over my eyes. 
It was as though the forest itself was urging me to go home, warning me of the awaiting danger that we could both feel.

The shrieking was getting louder, vibrating through every inch of my exhausted soul. until I hit darkness and everything just… Stopped.

———

A gust of wind pushed me to the floor and as I scrambled to get back on my feet that’s when the music started: a melancholic tune sang through the wind, floating around the leaves of the trees as they broke from their stems and surrounded me, stealing the last awareness I had of my surroundings. 

The song pushed me forward, beckoning me until a single ray of moonlight became visible, like a haunting beam of hope, casting itself down on a distant tree.

That’s when I saw her, as I was crawling through branches and fighting through leaves, the moonlight shone down on Ophelia, who was sleeping peacefully under the blanket of darkness the tree had created.

———

A visceral reaction took over my senses as I ran towards my baby, storming through anything in my path; allowing my primal human hardwiring to takeover.

And then I was shot down. 
Mere metres away from my baby, a force far bigger than I threw me to the ground, snapping my arms as they fought to catch my fall. 
bone splintering through my flesh, I continued to crawl towards the tree, dirt and insects finding home in the cavities of my ruptured skin.

A loud crash echoed through the forest and I looked forward to see the tree that had been protecting my baby had fallen, a sword like branch landing just inches away from causing a deathly blow to her precious face.

“You’re here” 
The same haunting voice from earlier hissed through the branches of the fallen tree as the entity emerged.

———

The creature then lurched forward, the tip of their long crooked nose resting on mine. Their breath was intoxicating; a sour smell filtering through a scent of rotting meat. I winced as they released heavy breaths of the putrid gas through their jagged black teeth, infiltrating my nostrils 

I raised my eyes to meet theirs, allowing me the opportunity to take in the sight that stood before me. The creature was nothing but skin and bones. Grey rotting skin with bones fighting to escape.

It held itself on all fours, balancing on claw like feet, which had pierced straight through a poor rodent that had unfortunately found itself in the beasts path on its way over to me.
Its beady eyes were pools of darkness that felt as though they were peering straight into my soul.

Distracted with trying to comprehend the Neanderthal lifeform before me, I hadn’t noticed it raise one of its gangly limbs. It reached for my face, impaling my cheek with its clawed nails as it held me in place.

———

“W..what are you” I cried, mustering up the same level of intimidation as that of a mouse. 

“I am an Erenthon” the creature announced

“My kind live amongst the trees, feeding off your human sacrifice” its spine chilling voice rasped at me.

In that moment it’s watchful eyes widened as its mouth twisted into a smile which stretched thin across its protruding teeth.

“which” it continued, “I must thank you for” .

My thoughts clicked into place as I registered what the Erenthon said…
“My baby” I cried as I pulled the wicked creature from me and raced toward Ophelia.

———

Another force propelled me once again, but this time I was thrown into a pile of large rocks, hearing my spine crack behind me. I started fighting to turn my feeble body around, the bones in my arm cutting further through my skin as blood gushed from my cheek. I grabbed hold of a rock for support and as it came loose I realise it was not a rock at all,
rather a skull,

A small skull,

A baby’s skull.

———

With no energy left to scream, I darted my eyes back-and-forth across the piles of baby bones which surrounded me. my mind spun and the forest felt as though it was dancing around me, branches flying and debris shooting at me with force.

The Erenthon appeared again…holding Ophelia by her neck. I watched as it used its strength to squeeze the life out of my baby. And for the first time since I had woken up, the shrieking stopped.

Once her limbs were unmoving, the Erenthon pulled on her lifeless arm, tearing the bones from the socket. 

Paralysed, I could do nothing but watch as it ripped my baby limb from limb, scraping her flesh from the bone and shoving it into its mouth. 
Once the Erenthon had removed as much of her muscles from bone as possible, it began sucking the bones clean, my baby’s blood drooling from its mouth.
I broke more and more with each swallow the beast took of my baby girl, but I was unaware that the worst was yet to come.

After the beast had skinned my baby from her bones, it lifted its arm up to her untouched face. 
It took one last glance at me and smiled as it tore its claws into both of Ophelia’s eye sockets and ripped her eyes out in one swift movement. 
I could do nothing but stare as the veins that connected my daughter’s eyes to her face were ripped apart.

The beast then opened its mouth and ate the eyes. 

It ATE my daughter’s eyes.

I still remember hearing the popping sound they made as they burst in its mouth. 

I was able to muster a final scream as it threw my daughters cleaned bones at me and left with a final “thankyou”. 
Leaving me alone in that wicked forest, clutching the remains of my first born.

———

I don’t sleep at night now. All I can hear is the shrieking in the back of my mind, haunting every second of my life. 
Sometimes the shrieking gets louder and I haul my paralysed body into my wheelchair to check on my second born. 
He’s always safe and at the age where he can’t be classed as a baby anymore so the Erenthon won’t take him, but every time that shrieking grows louder in my ears, I can’t help but be haunted by the vision of the beast being back to claim another one of my babies.
