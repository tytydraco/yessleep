I'm on shift right now, and I'm scared shitless. So I found a reddit where people might know how to help me. Because last night I saw her.

I'm not religious. I'm not a die hard atheist that believes in science, but i dont practice religion per say. Anyway to get through constructions slow season, I have a part time job as a security guard in a not so great area. Graveyard shift at that, 11pm-7am. My shift is at an abandoned hole in the wall motel being turned into a rehab, that the community seems it could use as there is frequent transients and drug zombies walking around. My job is basically to watch the property and catch any one that might jump the Wall or try to get in. The property is a long rectangle, with the gate being at one end with the office I stay in, and the rooms on the long side of the property going all the way down.

I'm here alone all night so luckily I've never had anyone get in in my 3 months here. But I've had another problem. 

To preface, I'm an avid horror fan, but I am fairly reasonable in the reality of things. I just enjoy the stories and videos and movies. So while alone in an abandoned motel at night I find it fun to listen to creepy pastas or put on a windigoon video while I'm on the computer or such. So when I retailed my experience to my gf, she simply laughed me off and refused to believe my "scary story", and tbh, I think it was for the better. This is my experience so far.

The first notable thing I can remember is when one of the homless people that hung out front, as there are plenty, died. I noticed one week that the homless people were no where to be found. After relaying this to the post comander that takes my place at 7pm, he told me a few days before my scheduled days that week, that an ambulance had come and they had to pickup a dead body out front. It was the young woman I had spoken too before. She was the only young one that hung out there. I had spoken to her before when she asked me to come in. I told her "no ofc not, why else would we have a locked gate". There was a few other interactions as she would be right outside the gate in front of the office and I'd tell her to move. I was always shocked at how such a young woman ended up there. Then she od'd and died. The next week, it started. I was on the computer playing Doom II 1996, and I heard the gate chains like someone was pulling on the gate, annoyed I pushed my chair back a couple feet to see out the window and the noise stopped as soon as I rolled uo to the window. The chains were still swinging. In less then 5 seconds I hopped up and was out the door facing the gate, and no one was there. I'd lie to say it didn't startle me a bit. I kept checking out the window the rest of the shift. 

A few days later another thing happened that scared me a little more. I was doing my patrol at the opposite end of the property, I was coming up to the shack scrolling my phone.

I always hated this shack because I was too lazy to take the flashlight, and it was spooky walking in the dark shack to scan the tag proving I did my walk. 
As I walked up to the shack I heard a noise that made me look up from my phone. It was creaking from the inside of the shack. The creaking I was familiar with as the noise the floors made while walking in side. I got nervous abt finally having to kick someone out of the property, and was afraid a drug crazed maniac would rush me. I yelled "hey get the fuck out of there" but the creaking stopped as soon as I did. I pictured a man waiting to get me as soon as I opened the door, but when I finally threw both the doors open to let the moonlight in, it was empty. Definetly empty. I take the flashlight now when I hit the shack.

We have a security tower out by the shack area, it calls the work phone when it detects motion, but not when the phone is near. I was in the office, and I got a call at 2 30, my first time getting one. It said something abt motion detected so I hopped up and went out side with a clear view of the whole area. Someone wouldn't have had time to run and jump the Wall in the time it took me to walked out the door and a couple feet out into view. No one. Not even after running down and inspecting the area. At this point I told my gf. She didn't belive me as I said. And said I was spooking myself with the stories I listen too. 

Last night was the worse. I was in the office, playing Doom II as usual, and for no reason I snapped around towards the window. I swear that I was being looked at. Yk the feeling? It makes your hair tingle and feels like you're about to be poked in the back of the head. But there wasn't anything. I was so convinced that I was being looked at. I was sure someone got in. I might have been too into my game and not heard them crawl under the gate. I walked out and around to the other side of the window. I didn't see anything and I walked to the gate to look for anyone. No one. As I turned to my left, I saw her. Attached to the office I stay in, sharing a wall and closest the the street, was an office for paying for a room. 
Behind the window, was a young woman's face peeking over the window sill. I've never been so scared in my life. But I quickly realized it just a tweaker and I need to get her out so I can keep my job. I took a few steps toward the door, her eyes followed me without moving her head. But I swear I felt like electricity hit me, because I'd recognized her. She was the girl that od'd. Out front. She had died. I pulled out my phone and I snapped a photo and then I took off fast back to the office and locked the door. I watched the window for the last 3 hours of my shift.

The room was empty when Ram came to take over at 7. I didnt tell him anything. I'm convinced that it was a ghost. Or a spirit or whatever you'd call it. I'm scared to be Gere now and need advice. What does one do to keep ghosts away. Has anyone else ever seen something like this or know what to do? I do not want to see her again. If there's nothing I can do, I'm going to quit and find another job bc I do not like this. I haven't seen or heard anything tonight, but I'm not so sure I'm gonna come back next week. Advice?
