**Step One**

Me.

Everyone else.

Agoraphobia had been with me since my late teens and had gradually encroached upon my freedom, engulfing everything over the ensuing decade. Now, in my thirties, I suspected it had even taken the memory of what that freedom was like. I considered it a curious state to be in, as opposed to the chronic condition it probably was, because how could I mourn an alternative I could barely recall? It couldn’t be seen, it couldn’t be touched, it couldn’t be felt. Maybe it was never different, and anything contrary to that was just a fever dream. The modern world had been good to the agoraphobic, in many ways. Mail order, online food shopping, 24/7 news, remote working. A good *enabler*, perhaps, but good nonetheless. 

However, I had to admit that there was a tiny seed within me that wanted for something. I had achieved a stable life by working around the inherent restrictions of agoraphobia, but I got lonely. Friends inevitably drifted away after I had to refuse their invitations one time too many. Some knew of my condition, but for all the goodwill in the world, even my oldest friends seemed to eventually tire of visiting just to spend all day in my flat. I didn't blame them. They had lives of much wider scope and opportunity. 

The access buzzer in my modest, cluttered flat sprang into life, putting my teeth on edge. I should replace it so that, as it obnoxiously signalled the arrival of its own replacement, I would only have to hear it one final time. It was particularly jarring, as I wasn't expecting any callers. There was no food on the way, no frivolous online purchases, no pre-arranged visits.

I depressed the intercom button. 

"Hello?"

"Stokkhus Mail delivery for Flat 1, 54 Southcrest Ro - "

" - yeah, yeah, that's me", I sighed, as I buzzed the visitor through. "Come on in." Pausing for the regulation 5 seconds it always took delivery men to reach my door, I took a deep breath and unbolted the door.

A squat, thick-set man with jet black hair and an unshaven countenance stood in the hall. Armed with a disinterested look, a puce-coloured polo shirt bearing the Stokkhus Mail logo, and a nametag that read ‘Ignacio', the man thrust a large, oblong package forward. "You just need to sign for it, mate", Ignacio grunted, pulling a battered-looking tablet out of a shoulder bag.

Scribbling down a signature, I took possession of the package and muttered a quick farewell. The heavy clump of Ignacio's boots suddenly stopped. Looking up, Ignacio was regarding me. They locked eyes. Then, the moment was over, and the delivery man disappeared behind the porch door.

The exact moment the door clicked shut, my mobile let out a keening buzz, as it signified a new message. The snap of the reverberation from the notification in my lounge bothered him. Wooden floors had a coolness that appealed to my propensity for walking around barefoot, but filled the room with hard reflections at the slightest sound. It was a trade-off. Cradling the package in one arm, I picked up the phone and brought up the message. It was Kellina.

*Hi! Sent you a present. Something that might help. Should be with you some time today xx*

Well, that was one question answered. I could count on my sister at least. She was the sole member of the family who actively made an effort to help. The vast ranks of cousins, aunties, and uncles maintained an embarrassed, standoffish stance of "what can be done?", which allowed them to effectively do nothing. This had remained the holding pattern for the last twelve years. I struggled with the feeling that this was it now, and my horizon had shrunk to fit a long time ago. Kellina was always searching for a way to either coax me outside or let something from the outside in. I bore it because I appreciated the concern, if not the method. It made me feel valued. However, she tended to want to rush me into things before I was ready. She had always been the more proactive of the two - conquering obstacles with a quiet determination that had served her well. She oversaw a string of cafes and had a stepdaughter she doted on. It was a full life, but she made time for me too. I was intensely grateful for that fact.

I wandered towards the lounge with the package. It had an unusual weight, which felt as if it was softly pressing and then depressing against my palms in a barely perceptible way. I slowed twice to try and detect it better, but I couldn't be sure. I was becoming less and less sure I wanted to open it up. Had Kellina, in a fit of pique, finally sent me the cat she frequently dropped heavy hints about? There were no air holes in the package I could see. No. She wouldn't do that.

I set the package down on the coffee table. Lowering myself into a cross-legged position, I considered it carefully. It didn’t seem to be moving. I ran my hands over it, trying to detect any motion, but none came. My imagination, perhaps. Time to discover.

The outer packaging was nothing of note. Brown parcel paper, neatly and carefully wrapped. I dug my fingertips under the vertical edge and teased it apart. Underneath was a worn cardboard box, once printed black, but now a sickly dark green. A faded pink neon grid set at a skew crisscrossed the entire surface, and stern, neon-blue letters spelled out the word ‘Ovar™' on all six faces of the box.

I tentatively hooked my thumb under the top flap, and drew it slowly along the width to a brittle tearing sound, as the aged sellotape yielded. The box seemed to breathe out, its folds and corners almost twitched, as a vapour of dust motes and sweet-smelling stale air rose from inside. Pressing on, perplexed, I gingerly pulled the top flaps back and peered into a surprising gloom. A shadowed, ovoid shape nestled at the bottom. I watched it intently for a moment but again detected no movement. Hesitantly, I reached in with both hands. My fingertips met with an unexpectedly pliant material, and I felt a faint prickle at the nape of my neck. Taking the weight of it, I gradually lifted it out of its nest. As it emerged, my eyes widened.

What I had in my hands, I couldn't quite comprehend. It was the size of a basketball, but slightly elongated lengthways, and wrapped in what looked uncomfortably like human skin. Its surface was mottled and pockmarked, with rising red patches of irritation and mole-like mounds scattered across the pallid expense of flesh. Sunken blue capillaries were visible just beneath the upper layer of skin. It seemed devoid of any opening or orifice, a blank, sallow-skinned globule that mutely demanded the space it occupied. Familiar, but utterly alien at the same time.

I realized I  had been staring at the globule for what seemed like an age. Snapping back out of my trance, I noticed a creased, yellowing piece of paper lying on the table. Peering at it, I made out some faded, partially legible lettering:

*Ovar™ brings \*\*\*\* world to you!*

*Ovar™ is \*\*\*e than technology!*

*Ov\*\*\*\* is life!*

More than technology? What did that mean? I felt apprehensive in its presence, even as I was compelled to find out more. There was no manual I could see. The box was frayed and battered, suggesting it had been in the hands of many previous owners. Perhaps any instructions had gotten lost along the way.

It needed to be put somewhere. Space had been available on the fireplace mantel when, during a hurried cleaning spree, an ornament I had inherited from my late grandmother slipped and smashed into a thousand pieces. My sister had been coming over, and I didn't want an entire afternoon punctuated by heavy hints about cleanliness, godliness, and all the rest. I'd felt hollow at the time, staring at the shattered remains, and eventually sadly gathered them up into a plastic bag, which was now stored under the sink. I couldn't bear to throw it away.

This spot would have to do. I perched it on the shallow shelf and stood back to size it up. The presence of the skin-like covering was quietly unsettling, but it was undeniably fascinating. I had to figure out how to interact with this thing. Perhaps it responded to touch? Tentatively, I placed my hand upon it. I felt a faint pulse thrumming below the skin. I supposed it was meant to give the impression of life.

Suddenly, the small patch of skin I was resting my hand on bowed inwards, and the tip of my index finger sank into the pallid flesh. I instinctively yelped and attempted to pull my hand back, but a fierce suction held onto it fast and, alarmingly, began to draw it further in. Panic gripped me, as the sensation of my trembling fingertip pushing aside what felt like slippery organs reached me. It put me in mind of scraping the innards from a chicken with bare hands. Abruptly, a piercing sensation in the tip of my finger sent a shockwave up my arm, and the suction that held me fast assumed a lurching rhythm. It was taking my *blood*. Siphoning it from my veins.

Just as abruptly, the suction eased off. I impulsively ripped my hand from the globule, my finger exiting with a sickening pop. I stood in shock, staring. After a tense moment, a faint purplish redness, like ink in water, rose slowly beneath the skin of the globule and then flooded it. Eyes locked on the globule, I stumbled backwards in the direction of my bedroom, and darted inside, slamming the door. I was in shock. Fumbling for my mobile, I shakily tapped ‘Ovar' into a search engine. Nothing about the globule came up. Further search variations also uncovered nothing. What the hell had Kellina sent me? Was it alive? If so, how did it live? 

I had a laptop in the bedroom, so I spent the rest of the day ferrying myself between the bedroom and the kitchen, each time glancing furtively in the direction of the lounge. Sometimes, when I was especially stressed, I would imagine my mother - who had never visited, by the way - in the corner for a split second, holding onto the arms of a moth-eaten armchair for dear life, fingertips white, eyes scanning the window frame. *No*. Must distract. Work, then food. Work, then food. Eventually, I repaired to bed, tense and unsure of what to do. My fingertip had stopped bleeding. The globule felt almost aggressive in its implacability. It had a presence that refused to allow me to fully forget it was there.

Ovar inhabited my dreams.

**Step Two**

In my cautious quest for more, I'd researched therapies, self-help exercises, outreach groups, yet I never went. The panic was one thing. The intense sickliness when outside scared me to death. A tight, concentrated ball of nausea that pushed at the front of my ribcage, pulsing with the rhythm of my heart. To me, the world outside was a harsh terrain, filled with chaotic agents that resisted any kind of predictability. It was one thing to want something better for yourself. It was quite another to act upon it. I veered wildly between these two poles, and it was exhausting. I had most of what I needed right here, and in a pitiless world, could a proportion of what you wanted simply be the best that you can hope for? Even something to be glad about? After all, it could be so much worse. Be thankful for what you have. Stiff upper lip. I could hear my parents talking through me. I didn't blame them either. They just didn't fully understand and saw little reason why they should attempt to. Yes, that antiquated stiff upper lip.

The morning brought an uncharacteristic flash of courage. I bolted out of the bedroom towards the kitchen, shooting a glance at the mantel. Still there. Grabbing a tea towel, I marched back towards the lounge with as much resolve as I could muster. 

It regarded me silently from its platform above the fireplace, as I approached, wielding the towel like a weapon. Slinging it over the globule, I felt a momentary blip of relief as it was no longer visible. Emboldened, I grabbed it with both hands, the textured material a comfort under my fingers. The pliability of the globule was still evident though, and I hurriedly lowered it into its box. With a muted, but satisfying thump, it landed at the bottom. Nearly there. With one last push for bravery, I took the box down the hall, and hurriedly set it down next to the hulking rubbish bags waiting to be taken to their resting place in the yard. There. It was on its way out, at least.

I breathed out, finally. I needed a distraction until I felt ready to take the rubbish out. Out there into the chaotic, lethal world. It was a trial I always sought to delay. At least I knew where my boundaries were. Conveniently, the world had drawn them for me with precision - the yard with the waist-high red brick wall and iron bars jutting out upwards a further four feet on all sides. It was the closest situation to safety I could accept in the outside world. I was particularly thankful the bars were there, as I often experienced a wild, magnetic pull to violate the boundaries of the yard that scared me half to death. It was apparently similar to my sister's fear of heights, where being near the lip of a drop made her feel she might suddenly jump. For me, it was as if the outside wanted to drag me into its endless void. 

Not yet. Food would have to be it. I flipped open the breakfast cupboard to grab my usual solitary cereal bowl and stopped. There were two of them. Not two different bowls, but two that carried the same three concentric blue rings as decoration. I blinked. It was a strange enough sight to see in my flat, furnished as it was to accommodate one person, and one person only. I’d deliberately picked an apartment that had no room to expand to house an additional person. The same with kitchenware; one fork, one knife, one spoon, one plate, one bowl.

The original bowl had a chip at the rim that birthed a hairline crack winding down to the base. My sister frequently bemoaned the physical state of my possessions, so it wasn't inconceivable that she could have bought a similar one, and covertly slipped it into the cupboard. The original would break apart soon, after all. I looked closer at the budding replacement, and once again froze. This wasn't a brand new bowl. This had a chip at the rim too, and a hairline crack in the same place. This was the *same bowl*.

I grabbed both and up-ended them. The same fading, water-damaged price label on the base. I shook my head. It felt like some sort of practical joke. My sister was the lone person who visited with any degree of regularity. Could it be her? It didn't seem at all like the sort of thing she would do. Could I simply ask her straight out? Even if it was a prank at my expense, I had to admit the craftsmanship of the duplicate was extraordinary. Where the hairline crack snaked from side-to-side, a few centimetres from the rim on one bowl, so it did on the other. The slight yellowing of the lower third was there. The flaking of the underside label obscured the same fading printed digits. 

It couldn't be absolutely exact, I knew this. There was always a telltale sign of imperfection. Not even factories could produce exact copies. It was just the limits of the physical world. I experienced a small jolt, as I realized that the label was even slightly damp from the hurried wash I gave it after a midnight run on the cereal. Who in hell would go to those lengths? With no rational explanation within easy reach, I reflexively shoved both bowls back into the cupboard, and uneasily looked around for a way to busy myself.

Work, then food. Work, then food.

The day rolled on, query after query nagging at the fringes of my mind. They had more staying power than my usual worries, but I pushed them away, at least for the duration of my work. It was a curiously circular job. The more I wrote about agoraphobia, the more it became the only topic I was a true expert on. I didn't like it. Finally, I ran out of tasks - I was ahead for almost the entire week. What now? A little technical reading wouldn't hurt. I swivelled my office chair in the direction of my bedside table. A second volume of ‘Agoraphobia: A Mental Map' by Pavlos Alexopoulos lay atop the first at a careless angle, as if taunting me. Correlation might not be causation, but this coincidence could not be ignored. No. This was too much.

If the globule had seen fit to - entirely unprompted - steal the very fluid from my veins, presumably it could be coaxed or bullied into doing something else that might help me expose its secrets. Even if it simply performed some unbidden, alarming action, I knew I wanted something more from it. I felt somehow braver. Fishing it from the rubbish pile, towel in hand, I perched the globule back in its original place on the mantel. It was once again implacable. Unmarked, unaffected, indifferent.

I didn't want to touch it again if I could avoid it. I studied it further, noting the return of the pallid look to the outer layer, green-blue veins lurking beneath the surface, like reeds in a shallow river. Perhaps it would respond to speech. 

"Hello?"

The globule did not stir.

"On?"

Nothing.

"Hey!"

My rising irritation reverberated around the flat. I grabbed a pen and carefully pushed the flat end into its pale flesh. Aside from a small red welt that quickly faded, there was no reaction at all.

Fine. *Fine*.  It can have what it wanted before. I pointedly depressed a patch of skin with the tip of my index finger and waited. Not a thing.

I was getting angry now. What *was* this? I decided to message Kellina.

*Sis, where the hell did you find this thing? Yesterday, it did some fucked up thing to my finger, and now it doesn’t do anything! What is it even supposed to do? Why did you send it to me? This is weird as fuck*

I threw my phone aside. It was getting dark, and I'd barely noticed. I wasn't used to this kind of frustration, this kind of unknown. I felt a ball of sickliness in my chest and knew that sleep was the only option I had left.

**Step Three**

My head hurt. I groaned and rolled onto my back to stare at the ceiling. Weak sunlight played over the hard artex pattern that coated it. I'd dreamed of nothing but impossible situations, all of which involved me struggling to accomplish some task or other, accompanied by the weighted inevitability that I would fail. The residual feeling of defeat was intertwined with the very real frustration I'd felt the night before, and was now curdled by a dragging tiredness. If there had been no more reality-defying duplication since last night, I would throw the globule out this time. I'd had enough.

The two books in my room were still unique. Gingerly poking my head out of the bedroom, I scanned up and down the hallway. Nothing amiss at first glance. I crept out into the hall and scanned the kitchen. Everything was status quo. I pulled open the breakfast cupboard; two bowls, the same as yesterday. I would accept the initial duplication, as long as nothing more appeared. As far as I could see, nothing else had an unwelcome twin. Feeling emboldened by this seeming equilibrium, and yet keen to conclude my investigative sweep, I now strode through to the lounge. As I approached, I could see the globule resting atop the mantel like a mute king, observing me in its own imperious way. Then, I saw something that stopped me dead in my tracks.

My grandmother's ornament. Not smashed, not broken, but perfectly reformed. My stomach dropped, and I turned on my heel towards the kitchen, hoping against hope that this was some kind of waking nightmare. Throwing open the cabinet beneath the sink, I plunged my hand into the very back to grab the plastic bag I prayed did not contain the fragments. It rattled and clattered as I dragged it out, so I knew what the answer would be. So it was - the fragments were still there, sharp-edged, numerous, and not miraculously repaired. Another duplication.

Enough. The globule officially had to go, even if I had to violate the boundaries of the yard to dispose of it for good. Wrenching open a drawer, I reached for a tea towel. There were two, of course. I grabbed one in a fist, leaving its twin behind. Wheeling around, my eyes locked in on the three identical calendars hung on misaligned hooks. A sharp rustle came from my right and I whipped my head round to locate the source, this time to the hooks by the front door. A slew of extra coats flowed from beneath those hung up. My heart began to beat uncomfortably loud, thumping in my ears. The duplication was escalating.

Slipping momentarily on three overlapping, identical magazines splayed out on the floor, I prepared to take off back to the lounge, my courage in flux. Rounding the corner to the hallway, the increasing desperation to be free of the globule suddenly leapt up another notch. The dark wood bookcase that towered over me, hugging the west wall of the hallway, was now accompanied by others. One was turned widthways, with a third balanced precariously face down atop the first two. There was no space for me to squeeze through. A small gap framed the globule, as it regarded me silently. Peering closer, I could see stacks of duplicate ornaments, furniture, and photo frames prostrate before it, as if in praise.

I broke out into a cold sweat. I'd lost. The only way now was to leave. Leave my flat, my home, my protection. What other choice did I have? Ignoring the fast-rising dread that usually preceded a panic attack, I took the most ragged of deep breaths and flung myself in the direction of the front door.

"No," I breathed. "*No!*" Duplicate upon duplicate of my front door piled up against each other, stacked in an impossible fractal fan, some half-sunk into the floor where the spiral ran out of room. I had to try moving what I could. If I stayed, the alternative was too frightening to consider.

Forcing myself forward, my left leg found a cold, curved footing that spun my ankle out at an awkward angle, my toes almost meeting my shin. With a yelp, I plunged downwards, hearing an ear-splitting crash of china on duplicate china. The moment before I hit the ground, I caught a glimpse of blue patterned cereal bowls in teetering piles, and more cascading down from the breakfast cupboard. The resulting impact made me see stars.

I opened my eyes to a torrent of trainers spilling from their home in a small cupboard, and a shooting pain now surging upwards from my ankle made me gasp. Wincing, I slowly and carefully pulled myself upright with the help of a duplicate broom handle. Now manically scanning the kitchen, I saw the solitary window choked by a tangle of blinds and partial window frames. The floor was already ankle-deep with duplicated detritus. Every time I blinked, new junk appeared. 

*Blink.* 

A crush of washing-up liquid bottles. 

*Blink.* 

A fan of yellow cleaning cloths. 

*Blink.* 

Sandwich toasters in disorganized ranks, like an army roll call. Scattered crunches and scrapes reached my ears, as new duplicates appeared, and settled.

My phone blared into life, a fraction of a second later joined by a chorus of unseen others, ringtones echoing tinnily into the depths of the flat and rattling my brain inside my skull. The resultant reverberation made it impossible to locate where any one handset was, let alone the original. I stood helplessly as the call continued to ring out, my injured ankle sending spasms of complaint to my already overextended nerves.

A monstrous, jarring impersonation of my sister, chattered by a hundred duplicate phones filled the air, as the service went to answerphone. The jangling voice implored me:

***‘Bro,*** *ro, ro,* ***it’s*** *t’s t’s* ***me.*** *e. e.* ***Please*** *ease ease*  ***pick*** *ck ck* ***up.*** *p. p.* ***Your*** *our our* ***message*** *sage sage* ***worried*** *ried ried* ***me.*** *e. e.* ***If*** *f f* ***you*** *ou ou* ***can*** *an an* ***hear*** *ear ear* ***me,*** *e, e,* ***pick*** *ck ck* ***up.*** *p. p.’*          

There was a pause, and then a battery of sighs.

***‘I’ll*** *ll ll* ***come*** *ome ome* ***over*** *er er* ***after*** *ter ter*  ***work.*** *rk. rk.* ***Be*** *e e* ***safe.*** *afe. afe. ‘*

I felt a weight pressing against my shoulder blades, and, startled, I turned around as quickly as my mangled ankle would allow. The scent of dark wood hit me. Duplication of the towering bookcase had now reached the kitchen, snaking forward like dominoes. I tried to stumble back, but the detritus was knee-high now.

I became aware of what sounded like crickets. Then, I realized - it was creaking. From every cupboard, every drawer, every container in the entire flat. Then, the dam burst. The seams of the kitchen cupboards came apart, spitting out bulging tins of food, torrents of cutlery, spouts of dried pasta. Muffled crashes and thumps sounded from the other rooms, as they too belched out their contents.

A low grinding sound, followed by a sharp screech that slowed to a whine, issued from close behind me. I knew what had happened before I even looked. Materializing within the now waist-high sea of junk was a slow cooker, melding with whatever lay in the space it now occupied. Bifurcated plates, cups, and knives jutted out of the slow cooker, bizarre fusions of the everyday.

Before I even had time to fully process what I was seeing, a sound that truly chilled the blood reached my ears. A pained, keening plea for help, drifting in from the direction of the bedroom. 

From me.

My mouth hung slackly. The effect of hearing my own voice so distressed did something barely relatable to me. I felt like a hole had been punched through my torso. To my escalating horror, another keening voice joined the first. Then another. And another.

The din was tortuous. I felt a slight resistance near my foot. Looking down, I saw with alarm that a perfect duplicate of my right shoe had appeared, but it was welded at right angles with the toe of the one I was wearing. I kicked it off in fright, but I had taken my focus off the kitchen for a moment, and now I realized the cost of doing so. I was penned in by the waves of detritus, and the encroachment of the bookcases gave me no more than a square metre of room in which to stand. My breathing was ragged by now, and I knew I'd lost. 

Through a tall vertical crack between the bookcases, I suddenly glimpsed movement. Wide eyes like deep pits with only desperation at the bottom flashed into view. A mouth opening and closing slowly, like a stranded fish. One of…me…was staring right at me. It haphazardly pushed aside a stack of identical volumes of The Girl Who Played Go, and I could see its prone form struggling upright, the solitary difference in appearance being a large tear in the cheaply printed purple t-shirt I’d been wearing for the last few days.

Why was I thinking ‘it’, though? Was it any less a ‘me’ than me? Maybe I owed the duplicate that courtesy. After all, which of my family would even be able to tell the difference?

I collapsed backwards and breathed out heavily. I could barely make out the ceiling  now, and all that was left was to wait for some random item to materialize within me and end my ordeal.

And then, it was. A strangulated howl of agony escaped my lips, eyes snapping shut with blinding pain as it appeared within me, a wriggling parasite fusing with the body. The skin, the sinew, the bone. But it wasn’t me. Not *me* me.

The duplicate was fused at the pelvis with a second one, bones crossing through, around and over each other. One of the duplicates had tried to push the other away, so their hand was now deep within the other’s ribcage. One movement and it would all be over. I should have been horrified - and it was clearly torture for them - but I was strangely envious. All the effort, all the striving, all the fear. It could fall. They could let go, *finally*. A second later, their heads drooped, lungs constricting for the very last time and they were gone. They bore an eerie, sickly smile. Free?

I never felt I'd truly and freely chosen anything in my life. The decisions I made were always born out of fear, of trying to contort myself around restrictions imposed on me. If I was honest with myself though, I would’ve been uncomfortable with the responsibility of deciding my own fate. What did that make me? 

Shit, why even care? I would be joining them soon.

Suddenly, muffled thumps and yells emanated from behind the fractal fan of front doors. A din of both male and female voices. The police? My sister? Both? I felt like I should've immediately cried out for help, but something stopped me. This was a moment. A moment where I either commit to clawing at the ether for a tiny chance at life, or let…go. Neither leapt out as the obvious answer. On one side, the struggle begins anew. On the other, an eternal end to every second you lived on a knife-edge attempting to deal with.

If there was any time to choose, it was now. Struggle, or acceptance? 

Is there something better on the other side of this…?

Choose, you dickhead.

*Fuck it.*

We all cried out simultaneously in a chorus of frantic need. There was a tense silence from outside, then urgent murmuring. 

*WHAM*

A sharp crack rang out from the front door, as the entire apartment structure shook from the impact. 

*WHAM*

Again, my world shook. The shock waves thrummed through my chest.

*WHAAAM*

On the third hit, the front door must have come apart, because all the detritus leaning against it collapsed outward, flowing towards the exit in a cursed avalanche. The shocked faces of two beefy-looking police officers and my sister materialised, as the shell of my life was rent in two like a gutted ship hull, its cargo open to everyone.

They reached for me, and I reached for them.

**Step Four** 

A discarded battering ram lay in the lobby, festooned with screws and a shower of disassembled door hinges. The splintered remains of my front door were crumpled in a corner. I was sitting on a slew of objects; a magazine, a broken cup, several combs. Through the haze of my waning adrenalin, I noticed a yellowing, torn piece of paper. Reaching for it and turning it over in my hands, I saw just the one phrase.

Ovar™ brings \*\*\*\* world to you!

The world? 

This world?

Or your...?

Ovar™ brings your world to you. I guess it did, and having been up close, I'd now realised that I didn’t want it surrounding me anymore.

I saw one of the policemen hauling the spheroid away into a van, studying it quizzically. I wanted to warn them, but something caught in my throat, and I hesitated. It didn’t seem fair, or right, but perhaps everybody has to find out in their own way. 

Slumped on the floor, the wide-open lobby door welcomed all the jagged sounds of the outside world in to meet my jangling nerves. I realised that all I truly wanted was right in front of me, the only barrier being mere fear. It was my passenger, now and forever, on into the endless ether. We travel together. 

*Ovar™ brings your world to you.*
