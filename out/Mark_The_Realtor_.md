Emma and John had been house hunting for months when they stumbled upon a listing for a charming, Victorian-style house on the outskirts of town. The price was unbeatable, and the photos looked perfect. They called the number on the listing and were greeted by a friendly voice on the other end. The realtor, Mark, seemed knowledgeable and eager to show them the property.

When they arrived, Mark was already waiting on the porch. He was tall and had a reassuring smile. As they walked through the house, Mark pointed out the features: the original hardwood floors, the spacious kitchen, the large windows letting in natural light. It all seemed too good to be true.

"This place is amazing," John said, looking around in awe. "Why hasn't it sold yet?"

Mark's smile widened. "It's a hidden gem, just waiting for the right couple to come along."

Emma couldn't shake a strange feeling, but she chalked it up to the excitement of possibly finding their dream home. They toured the rest of the house, and despite the eerie silence and the chill in the air, they decided to move forward. Mark promised to get back to them with the paperwork.

A few days later, Emma couldn't stop thinking about the house. Something felt off, and she wanted to take another look, this time without the realtor. John was at work, so she decided to go alone.

When she arrived, the house was as still and silent as before. She let herself in with the spare key Mark had given them and started exploring more thoroughly. Everything seemed in place until she noticed a small, nearly invisible door at the end of a hallway. It was partially concealed behind a heavy bookshelf.

Curiosity piqued, she moved the bookshelf and opened the door, revealing a narrow staircase leading up to the attic. Taking a deep breath, she ascended the creaky stairs. At the top, she found herself in a stark, white room. It was meticulously clean, almost sterile, with harsh, overhead lighting.

Pinned to one wall were photographs of families, all smiling happily in front of the house. Emma's blood ran cold as she recognized some of the faces from local news stories—families that had gone missing over the years. Her hands shook as she examined the photos, each one telling a silent, terrifying story.

In the center of the room was a metal table, upon which lay various tools: saws, knives, and other implements, all meticulously arranged. Emma's stomach churned as she realized what this room was used for. Her heart pounded as she backed away, trying to process the horror she had uncovered.

Suddenly, she heard a noise from downstairs—the sound of the front door opening. Her heart skipped a beat. She couldn't let Mark find her here. Moving quickly and quietly, she descended the attic stairs and slipped out the back door, hoping to avoid detection.

She made her way to her car, hands trembling as she fumbled with the keys. She glanced back at the house, half-expecting Mark to appear at any moment, but there was no sign of him. Breathing a sigh of relief, she started the car and drove away, eager to put as much distance between herself and that house as possible.

As she drove down the dark, winding dirt road back to town, her mind raced with thoughts of what to do next. She needed to warn John, to go to the police, to make sure no one else fell into Mark's trap.

But as she drove, the car began to sputter. The engine lurched and the car slowed to a stop. Emma's heart sank. "No, no, not now," she muttered, trying to restart the engine, but it was no use. The car was dead.

She stepped out, popped the hood, and checked the engine. To her horror, she found parts deliberately ripped out. Her stomach twisted with fear. Mark had somehow sabotaged her car.

Emma looked around, the dark forest closing in on either side of the road. She pulled out her phone, but there was no signal. She felt utterly isolated.

As she stood there, trying to figure out what to do, she noticed movement among the trees. Shadows of figures, at least a dozen, stood silently, watching her. Her breath caught in her throat as she realized they were slowly advancing.
