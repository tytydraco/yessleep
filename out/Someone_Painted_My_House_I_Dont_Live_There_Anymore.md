My house *was* red. Exposed brick, two stories, black shingles, front *and* back yard. 

I was only gone one week. Now my house is white.



There was nothing taken. There were no doors unlocked. No alarms were tripped. Nothing destroyed or kicked over, nothing squashed or bent, nothing *here* when it should’ve been *there*… Nothing. But now my house is white.



My neighbours say the painters came the first day I left. Pulled up in a van and everything. Took out their ladders, wearing their coveralls, set the buckets down and got to painting. When evening came, they left. When morning came, they came back and kept painting ‘till my whole house was white from front to back. Then they just… went home.



I wasn’t quite sure what to do. There isn’t exactly an established protocol for what to do when persons unknown decide to spontaneously renovate your domicile. I suppose some people might even be thankful. I was not one of them.



I can’t really say I felt too much unease when I first stepped out of the cab. It was still my house after all, it just looked a little different on the outside. I suppose I really started to feel it when I realized it didn’t look any different on the inside. Not a hair was askew. I suppose it struck me then: someone painted my house. That’s it. I wasn’t robbed, there was no break-in, nobody trashed the place, but someone painted my house. 



I had the most awful dreams that night. Dreams of the house. Dreams of shuffling down the sidewalk in the oddest hours of the night; gliding by dark, empty homes; skulking beneath the flickering street lamps… Suddenly I was there. I was home. I slid up the walkway, put my keys in the door… It was very dark and so, so quiet. And by the stairs a door. 

I didn’t go to the door, the door came to me. Welcomed me without a word. To the basement. It was so dirty and so dry and before me was a hole into which had been cast all manner of wristwatches, smartphones, playing cards, wallets, lengths of twine, hairbrushes, toothbrushes, combs, bottles of bleach, cans of shaving cream… It went on and on and on. 



Without having to look, I saw above the pit, suspended by smooth and keratinous appendages, a globby ball of smooth, grey meat from which dangled a windpipe and a pair of bulbous lungs which swung limply back and forth over the hole.



I had felt as though I might have dove into that abyss had I not been awoken by a voice from downstairs. There was someone downstairs and, in a very raspy voice, I heard them shouting “Tony! Tony!” There was someone in my house.



I snatched my phone from my bedside, ducked under the bed frame, and dialled 911. I could hear when they came with my ear smushed up against the floor.



They had him cuffed, sitting in the back of a patrol car, his head hung out the window, panting like a seasick sailor about to vomit. 



I almost felt sorry for him. He was so pale, so gaunt, so wretched. I don’t know exactly why, but I couldn’t help but clutch my jacket closed as his eyes met mine.



“Here,” Came a voice in my right ear. One of the officers took my wrist and softly placed something in my hand. My keys.



“He took my keys?” I found myself asking.



“Man, I didn’t take *shit*,” I heard my intruder croak before rolling his head back with his jaw hung open. “Thems was given to me, Tony gave them to me.”



I glanced over at the cop to my right. He just held up his hand as if to say ‘Don’t pay him any mind’ as he and the other officer quietly stepped into their vehicle. 



“This *bullshit* man,” My intruder rasped, turning now to me, seeing, I imagine, the officers' very apparent lack of interest. “I’m *telling* it, Tony gave thems to me, said they was for the white house on Sable.”



I suppose one of the officers began rolling up his window, and my intruder thumped his cuffed wrists violently against the back of the mesh partition. “Tony, man! Brother said go in, and go on down!”



Down *where*, I can’t be sure. He just kept shouting ‘down, down, down,’ as their engine thrummed to life and the car lulled off into the night.



Once more, I was alone. It was so cold out there, wet, and damp… Out there it *tasted* like night. I wanted nothing more than to go back inside and crawl back into bed, to try and calm my nerves and slow my racing heart, but for the longest time I could do little more than glare at the house across the street for I couldn’t bring myself to turn and face what stood behind me.



I would go back inside that night, but I kept my head down. I didn’t want to see it; I didn’t want to see my house, my house which somebody painted white, and as I stepped inside with my gaze affixed on the floor I raised my arm as I was accustomed and tossed my keys into the bowl by the door, but I was not met with the normal, hollow ‘thunk’, but an icy metallic clamor.



I think I knew before I even looked. There, in the bowl, sat *two* sets of keys. Two identical, indistinguishable, lifeless sets of keys. Keys for my house, which someone painted white. These weren’t my keys. My intruder got these keys from somewhere. Maybe ‘Tony’ really did give him those keys- gave him those keys, told him to go to the white house on Sable, my house, my house that someone painted white, and go *down*. 



As if it were out of my own control, I found myself slowly, very slowly, glancing over at the stairs. I couldn’t see it, but I *felt* it. That door. The door that went *down*.



I couldn’t bring myself to spend another second in that house. I just got in my car and left. My stuff is all still there- my laptop, TV, clothes, *everything*\- but I can’t go back. I’m left with nothing but a white house I cannot bring myself to even look at anymore, and this awful feeling that every time I close my eyes at night there’s a chance I might open them and find myself back there. I could really use some advice. Please help me.
