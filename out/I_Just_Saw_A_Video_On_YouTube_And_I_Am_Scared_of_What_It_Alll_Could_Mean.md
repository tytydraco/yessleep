I’m still in disbelief and still freaked out, by what I just saw.  
   
I am not even sure where to really begin.  
I’ve thought about this for the last five days and it still doesn’t make any sense to me. I’m not sure what any of this this means.  I showed my friends the video and they were flabbergasted.  One of them even accused me of playing a “long game” practical joke.  But after much heated arguing between the 4 of us, that I wasn’t pranking anyone, we eventually were left confused, and me, mostly scared.  There were more theories that we bounced around but none of us could make any sense of what we really saw.  I haven’t slept well since.  It’s been, to say the least, a nightmare.  I am going to back up here.  Writing this out, I hope will help and who knows, maybe someone else has seen the video and can help.  But at the least it will serve as a record of what the hell has been happening.  Yes, happening… not just happened.  
Here it goes. But before, I do, I have to say, I am not a huge supernatural spiritual kind of guy, for what it’s worth, but I don’t know if that matters at this point. Sorry for any formatting,  I did this from my phone.   
Ok. So lately I have been watching lots of YouTube videos, just the random ones that pop up on my feed.  Sometimes they are connected to previous searches, and sometimes they are not.  It all could be algorithmic and how all that works.  Regardless, I found most of the videos and YT shorts pretty entertaining and good enough to watch.  I would do this randomly throughout the day but mostly at night, right before sleep.   
Nothing unusual sticks out in my mind from about four days ago, or the days leading up to the video in question.  I was in bed, excited about having signed the papers that would have me moving to a new home at the end of my current lease.  The move was planned for end of July, I would have plenty of time before the 4th and BBQ’ing with family and everything, to get ready so that my move would go as smoothly as possible.  My new place, would be in a nicer part of town, nothing dodgy or shady to indicate that there is, was, or would be an issue of any kind.  Rent wise, it would be a little more but I would have a bigger room and a much safer neighborhood with a real backyard for hanging out, and my friend of 6 years would be splitting the rent with me.  He, we’ll call him Justin, does a lot of odds and ends jobs from; handy man, Uber driver, to having a few clients he cooks and meal preps for, a real jack of all trades, and is barely home.  He makes good cash so that we could both upgrade in living conditions without creeping into our budgets.  Again, all no red flags here.   
I will say this, I am closet prepper.  My close friends know, it’s not a big deal, as I keep it mostly to a contingent disaster planning kind of thing.  Again not a big deal.  It’s mostly having enough food and water for three days, and some basic  defensive gear and attire.  I stress the word defensive here as I am not a gun nut, nor an apocalypse guy.   
Sorry if this is a little long winded, but please bare through with me.  I swear this will all make sense as to why all this has spooked me.  
So I was up late watching videos, and one video sticks out that looked good enough to watch.  It was titled something like “Going through a hoarder’s house, and look at what crazy stuff we found!!!”.   Again, something innocuous like that.  So I hit play, and the person recording the video, is filming the outside of a dilapidated house.  Now, I had watched the video almost 10 times since I first saw it, but on the first go around, I missed how familiar the house kind of looked.  The guy filming makes his way through a complete mess of a house. Think dumpster trash meets organized chaos.  Again, nothing about the house looks crazy, just that it was long abandoned and in bad bad shape.  As he is filming, he is talking to another guy off screen, BTW we never see any of the guys faces.  We get one body shot of the guy’s friend, but more on that later.  The guy goes through the living room, the kitchen, and then moves on to the garage, occasionally tossing through some of the crap, looking for anything of value.  I’m about to close out and go to the next video, as I was losing interest, when he mentions spotting a large box /trunk in the corner.  As he goes to the trunk, I feel a tingle of something in the back of my mind, because I have a similar looking box in my room.  As the guy approaches, I and see that it is the same kind of trunk box that I have, and I can’t help but feel a bit of pride, that I had selected a strong and sturdy box that could survive such bad conditions and I mentally congratulate myself on my solid, yet frugal purchase.    
The guy and his friend rummage through a shit crap of stuff to get to the trunk box.  They discover it has a lock, and after a minute, the guy’s friend comes back with a pair of bolt cutters, and after a second attempt he is able to snip off the lock.  When he opens the trunk and I see what they are recording, going through the items inside, my stomach starts to tighten.  The guy is holding up a very distinct looking pry bar.  Normally this by itself wouldn’t mean much, but attached to the pry bar tool is a red, Sharpie sized flashlight.  So here you may be thinking, what’s the big deal?  Well for starters; I have such a pry bar.  I have that exact same red flashlight, which is knotted to the pry bar in just such a way.   
The guys move on to the other items in the trunk.  A pair of swimming goggles, a plate carrier with plates.  On the plate carrier is a patch, it reads in big black and white letters, “O-Postivie”.  Yup.  Those are all things that are in my trunk that I have in my closet right now.  I am O-Postive, and I have that same patch on my plate carrier in the exact same spot.  No way this could all be coincidental by any stretch of the imagination.  If all that weren’t enough to prove what I was starting to think/fear; they rummage through and find, “my” sealed water pouches, and dehydrated food pouches, both of which have a date scribbled on them.  From the video, the dates look like it could be in my handwriting, and yes, this is something I do for my food and water pouches.  Then, they exam my rain poncho, my medical kit and a big ass knife, a big ass knife that I bought from a used military surplus store.  How do I know, it’s my knife and not just some other random knife?  Because written in gold sharpie ink, on the fucking blade, is the same fucking price that was written on the blade of the knife I bought at the surplus store.   
I start losing my shit.  I get out of bed, start pacing back and forth not sure what the actual fuck I am witnessing.  I pause the video, and try looking at the info section.  There is nothing but a small description of the generic discoveries in the hoarder’s house.  And then I hear myself, involuntarily, let out a high pitch gasp of disbelieve. The fucking date of the video is from a year ago.  A fucking year ago!  My mind is circling with disbelief.  Almost like vertigo of the mind.  I lose the strength in my legs and collapse to the floor.  I am breathing heavy trying to make sense of everything. I somehow, managed not to drop my phone that I still have in my hands.   I read and re-read the date stamp of this thing.  Yup, it reads, “a year ago”.  
After what seems like forever, I shake some of my nervousness off and regain enough courage to hit play.  There is only like another 2 minutes left.  I resume watching as they go through the box and now for sure, I have no idea what to thinking.  The guys recording grow giddy as they come across a bundled up item wrapped in navy blue t-shirt.  I know that t-shirt because it’s my old High School t-shirt.  From inside the t-shirt, the guys uncover a fucking handgun!   Looking at the video, I see my shirt and I see a gun.  I’m in total disbelief because that’s my shirt.  My Shirt!  My shirt with the same old paint splattered stains that I got on it when I helped my dad paint the fence from 4 years ago and that I still have right now, folded away in my dresser.  But, I don’t own a gun!   
The guys then move over to a coyote brown backpack (yes, also something I own) and find numerous boxes of ammo (but yet again, I don’t own a gun so why would I have ammo).  They go through the backpack, and yup all my things I keep in there are there, a water filtering straw, butt wipes, a Leatherman multi tool, I got on sale that was still in the box, just like I have it now, in my coyote brown backpack, in the trunk, in my closet.  
I am completely beside myself.  It was 11:30 at night.  I am watching a year old video, of my stuff, with no explanation on how it’s in this house!  
As if not to freak myself out even more, the guy filming, grabs a book, a book that I am unfamiliar with, and they flip through it.  Just as scared as I am intrigued, I keep watching as they quickly thumb through it, commenting if they will find money.  It looks like a journal.  And then at the last few pages or so, they come across four photos tucked in the back.  The camera lingers long enough for me to see that it’s a family picture.  I presume a mom and her two kids, both boys.  The mom looks like she is in her 30’s and the kids look young, maybe 5 and 2.  Unfortunately, I don’t recognize anyone in the photo.  
The video wraps up, with the guys, having sprawled out all the stuff worth of value on the garage driveway.  All of my prepper stuff, generic pots and pans, a cutlery set, a large duffel bag that is unzipped showing-off its contents of various tools like screwdrivers and hammers.  The last thing they have out is a BBQ grill that looks to be in good shape, but that I don’t own.  As the camera pans up, someone stick their thumb in the air, gesturing “all good”.  It’s in this last split second that the house they have just come out of, is seen from a different angle, and that makes me recognize the house.  It’s the house that I have a lease set up for in a few months.  
So that was the video.   
I stand there for a second processing everything, when I start screaming out for Justin, my roommate.  He almost crashes through the door to see what’s going on.   
Later on Justin would go on to tell me, that night, the way I had yelped cried his name he knew that something serious was up by the sheer pitch and wailing of my voice.   
As Justin is trying to figure out why I called out for help, I try explaining the video, but can’t.  So after a few minutes of rambling off non coherent words, I just hit re-play on the video and hold it up to his face and I watch him watch the video.  He watches the whole thing through and when it’s over, he doesn’t get it.  I practically explode, spewing out more nonsense words, dropping f-bombs left and right.  And he laughs.   
At this point, I jump into my closet, throw off the shoes and shit I have on top of my trunk box, and start grabbing everything that was just shown in the video.  I keep screaming out “SEE!?” over and over again.  After what feels like a lifetime of me screaming “SEE?” over and over at him, it finally dawns on him what has me so freaked out.  But the magnitude of what we just watched still hadn’t hit us.  He starts throwing out crazy theories, on how it could all be possible.  But no way, no way, there is a rational rational explanation to this.      
So we do what any other sane scared college aged people do, we call our friends to come over.  Just past midnight our two other friends show up thinking we are doing an impromptu beer and Fornite campaign.  We were vague in our call when we asked them to hurry over.  Justin and I don’t say a word, we hit play and we let them watch the video.  Justin and I exchange looks the entire time as we watch them watch the video.  And just like Justin, they don’t see the strangeness to it.  I go to my room, drag out the trunk box, and go through the shit again.  Well at this point, there is a shit storm.  Its goes from WTH to WTF in a matter of minutes.  Our two other friends, we’ll call them John and Marcus, start off pissed that this was the reason we called them over, "a stupid video".  But as we re-watch the video, and me grabbing all my crazy prepper stuff, John starts cursing and accusing me, of playing a prank.  For reference, John is a ghost believer and paranormal connoisseur.  He is obviously having a hard time and he practically shoves me out the way and storms off in his car.  Marcus stays with us and is stoic and quiet.    
Unsure of what to do, the three of us sit in silence.  After about another minute, Marcus asks if we can see the video again.  We do.  We watch it, four/five more times that night.  God, I love my friends.  On the third go around, we are pausing and taking down notes, Marcus’ idea.  We aren’t sure of what we are note taking for, we just know we need to.   
Marcus then asks if I can look up the guy that posted the video, for other videos, and when I do, Youtube refreshes, and I can’t find the video.  I search for it but nothing.  My friends each try looking for it and both come up empty.  
So for the last four days, this has consumed us.  John eventually came around, and apologized.  Justin was equally freaked out as much as I was, after the initial shock and disbelief faded.  Marcus is still wary, still a bit of a doubter, but he believes everything he saw, and what I’ve shared.   
That’s about it.  
Sleeping is tough, I am unsure, of what to do at this point.  Cancel the lease?  Get rid of my stuff?  Move back home with my parents? I have no clue where or what to think or do.  I’m struggling at work.  The one online class I’m taking is tough to concentrate on.  
UPDATE:   
Just before hitting “post” on this thing, two more “strings” tied to this have emerged.  One, Justin came out and said that the grill in the video is his.  When we questioned him about it, he said that he just bought it, and that it’s still in the box at his parent’s storage unit, and that he was waiting for our new place to unbox it, assemble it, and use the damn thing.  He was equally scared because the more he thought about it, he seemed more and more convinced the duffel bag full of tools in the video were his, but since our attention was mostly on my shit, he doesn’t know for certain.    
The second string to this was John.  John comes from a big family, not his immediate family, but rather his extended one, aunts and uncles.  He confessed to us that at the end of the video, when the guy gives the camera the thumbs up, there was a very distinct tattoo of a pine tree and names on the forearm that he recognized.  When we pressed him for more info, he said it could be 1 of 8 people, but that he is 100% sure it is in fact the family tattoo they have.  Worse, John had been planning on getting the very same tattoo when he graduates in May, but he has since decided not to get it anymore.   
As far as who it could be; It technically could be his dad, though very very unlikely, or either of his 2 fraternal uncles, or (of their kids) any one of his 5 male cousins.  In all honesty, though it could be anyone from the list, it’s also equally as unlikely to be them too because there are lots of reasons they couldn’t be the “Thumbs Up Guy”.  Like; his dad uses a wheelchair. One of his uncles with two adult kids, John's cousins, live clear across the country and have mentioned on numerous occasions that they would never, ever, live or work here, because according to them, this place is way too liberal for them.  One other cousin, from his auntie, is a scrawny little dipshit that is allergic to any kind of real work, and his last two cousins, who are both much older, are married with their respective wives, have a family, live out of state, and are basically living the perfect suburban life.  So, I don’t know… None of us know at this point what to do.   
If anyone can help us, help me, it would mean a lot.  The more I think about it, the worse the possible scenarios I come up with in my mind, and that frightens me.  I am legit afraid and worse I have no answers of any kind.
