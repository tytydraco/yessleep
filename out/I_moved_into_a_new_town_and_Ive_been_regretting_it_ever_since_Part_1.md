I had been living paycheck to paycheck back in my hometown but when my current job let me go I had to move. The rent was too high for me pay along with basic amenities and paying for my family. That was until they left me. My wife who I had loved as well as my 2 very dear children. I remember that day still perfectly like a scar in my mind leaving that horrible mark forever. I had some money left then so I decided to look for cheap houses under 50k. That's when I found this seemingly perfect town secluded in the middle of nowhere with jobs available for me. The house was already finished from the inside coming with all the furniture, a TV and the ability to have it changed for free for the first week of moving,

As I made the turn off the highway, with the few remaining items I had in the trunk of this rusty old car, to the remote little town I was still wondering how I got the property for so cheap. It looked like a perfect little town with an even better community of people in it. There was no reason that house should have gone for anything less than a couple hundred thousand especially not for $1,200. The listing said that there were some rules that we would have to follow when we moved into that town but I thought it would be ok. After all, every community has some rules. Still, it was all a little Macabre as I entered the town.

Upon turning into the street of my new house I saw the trees full of fruit and green grass with perfectly paved roads. With a clear sky with the sun beaming down on the quaint little town I thought that maybe just maybe, I could turn my whole life around. I made a mental note to collect some of the fruit from the trees in my new lawn as I parked my car in the driveway heading to the front door. I took out all the items from my trunk lining them in front of the door to see that the key was left in the lock only. Turning it I heard a click as the door unlocked for me to push it open. I took my stuff inside and intended to unpack after I took a tour of my new house and met some neighbours when a piece of paper on the table in the living room caught my eye. As I moved closer saw it had some stuff written on it so I picked it up. It read:

"Welcome! I see you are the new residents of our town after the unfortunate incident that happened to the previous tenants of your house.

Some rules are to be followed at all times in this town with more specific rules that you will be getting for other things such as school and your house though you do not need to worry about these for at least your first month.

This month all you need are these rules I will provide you about the town. It is of utmost importance you follow every rule given to you lest you want to end up like the previous residents.

1.Always be home inside by latest 10 pm to 6 am, every night. This is non-negotiable and probably the most important rule for you to follow because this is when The Creatures hunt in the town.

1a. If you are unable to get home in that time you may take shelter anywhere else you can find such as your office or another resident's house after taking permission. Most offices will have a bed in case you can't leave in time.

2. You must keep your curtains closed at night because The Creatures can peer inside. The Creatures hate wasting time so they won't go into houses that they know aren't currently used. They know yours just got recently...vacated so they probably won't check it for the first week but still better to be safe than sorry!

3. If someone you encounter seems off in any way whatsoever. DO NOT give them attention. You may acknowledge them silently but don't yell it out loud or make eye contact with them after you notice something off.

3a. If you notice something is off while talking to them it's best to give an excuse and walk away from them as quickly as possible cutting them or yourself off. The excuse doesn't have to be the best just good enough for you to leave The Creatures aren't very intelligent.

4. Keep the number of knocks in mind every time someone is there. If it is less than 2 knocks DO NOT open the door. It is one of The Creatures trying to get into your house. If it is over 2 you can open the door for another resident.

4a. At night (10 pm - 6 am) this rule is reversed. We do not know why but it is probably to trick you into opening the door for you.

5. If you hear your doorbell ring, never answer it. We haven't installed doorbells in any houses.

6. This town may look beautiful with all the orchards and fresh fruits that you will not be able to identify growing but do not eat them. THEY get very mad and will come after you. Trust me they know who took their fruit. That's how I lost my wife.

7. If The Creatures manage to get to you please refrain from killing yourself, you will die none the less but go out the honourable way fighting and we may be able to save you in time or they may decide not to kill you if they are few due to splitting up on very rare occasions.

8. Where there is one there are many.

9. You may hear scratching from a room in your house sort of like a hairbrush on rough fabric. Read any religious scripture you believe in be it the Quran, Bible or any other religious book/text. The Creatures do not like any of them.

10. Make sure to be a pious practising religious person in your religion as well if you are a Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or anything else. It serves as a sort of repellent for The Creatures think of it as the equivalent of some skunk spray for you.

11. Keep your children close as that is The Creature's favourite target.

12. This should go without saying but please do not make enemies in the town as when you need safety from The Creatures it can come back to bite you.

13. The Creatures mostly prey on people in worse mental conditions such as the stressed and depressed being able to smell these things from miles away. If you need a break or to be exempt from work just message us and take a test for us to confirm your mental state and we will give you what you need.

14. Honesty is appreciated in this community as this whole idyllic place wasn't built on lies.

15. No matter what the voices say do not go into the cave on the edge of the town. It is where The Creatures take their victims to feed to their leader trying to nurture It back to full strength to once again claim the town.

16. Keep your doors and windows locked at all times be in when home or away. Things can sneak in if a door is left open.

17. If you knew someone who has been taken by The Creatures you do not know them anymore. The Creatures use these new victims to lure more people to the cave. That's how I lost my kids and almost myself. Don't worry we provide a list of fresh victims to look out for daily. The bodies usually don't last over a week.

18. In future rules some may directly go against what I have written in a previous rule. In that case, remember the one that came before is the correct one.

19. The Creatures can imitate voices when they are in moonlight so no one can let you in on voice (begging, screaming) after 10 pm unfortunately so remember the code in rule 4a.

19a. Similarly if anyone begs for you to let them in and doesn't do the knock stated in rule 4a do not let them in no matter who they sound like be it your little brother or your mother.

20. Music is allowed at all times just not overly pop songs such as K-POP. They like that music. Don't know why but it attracts The Creatures to you.

21. Preferably if you like alternate (e.g 21 pilots), Indie (e.g lovejoy), Rock (e.g Queen) or even stuff like Elton Jhon, Eminem or The Beetles is ok. This music is preferred as it hurts The Creature's ears for some reason.

22. Alway keep something ready to play this kind of music e.g a Spotify playlist shortcut (premium is provided to every resident for this reason) in case you are in a bad situation.

22a. We all have music to signal it as well such as mine which is Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, Sarah's is I'm still standing by Elton Jhon and Marc's is Stressed out by 21 Pilots. The full list will be on the kitchen counter. Please try to it safe to know which house The Creatures are at or who to help.

23. Please keep screaming to a minimum thus don't watch or read a lot of scary things at night. It draws attention to you and disturbs us all.

24. We celebrate all holidays. We celebrate them in different parts of town e.g last year it was downtown for Christmas and Eid, uptown for Hanuka and other places for other holidays as well. Locations are given close to each holiday roughly a month before it.

25. Don't be racist, sexist, homophobic etc. we like to include all people from all walks of life here :) Punishment for breaking this rule is being the night guard at the gates of the town for 7 nights in a row.

26. At night you may sleep as they do not sense anyone if they aren't awake and thus you would be practically invisible to them."

Seeing this I immediately dismissed it as someone trying to scare me, the new resident. Though it was nagging me. Maybe that is why the listing was so cheap. I decided to change my plans and get moved in first and then confront my neighbours about it, to see if they knew anything. It took me roughly an hour to get everything where I thought it should go even though it was only 15-20 small items I kept with me. By this time it was around 5 pm so I thought I better get a move on and ask some neighbours about the note.

First I went to ask my neighbour Sarah, a woman with a kind face, and an even kinder personality as well as her husband Ahmed and her 2 kids. We would talk for a while, introducing ourselves and getting friendly. Eventually, I brought up the note that I found on the table and suddenly that soft and cheery face turned into one of pure seriousness. Those joyful eyes were now full of concern. She gritted her teeth saying "Make sure not to ever break those rules". After this, we returned to our conversation as I left a few minutes later. I talked to other neighbours but they all had the same reaction. I decided that maybe I could break one rule and peek out the window to see these creatures.

I started by following these rules. I was home inside before 10 pm with the doors and windows locked and the curtains all drawn. I had my religious text close and a shortcut for some music on my phone that was approved by the town neighbours and leaders. I decided to choose Stan by Eminem as my song and it was added to all the sheets. Shortly after I decided to do something that I would forever regret. I decided to peek out of the window.

The street was dark, there were no lamps lit. It looked like one of those subliminal space images you see on the internet, a stark contrast from what it looked like in the day. Still, I could see what the creatures, in their true form, were. A creature of pure terror that even my nightmares could not concoct no matter how hard they try.

They have no hair at all. They were made of some sort of rubbery skin-like material only with lots of folds and ridges in them. Standing next to the trees they were tall enough to peek into the second-story windows but bend down to reach the door and windows. I saw them change size though not massively it was enough to allow them to become roughly 6'2. The teeth were all sharp a yellow tinge with red on the edges. They were vaguely humanoid, enough to pass off as a human if they were far enough away. Those red piercing eyes with nothing behind them. Hollow husks with only the ability to hunt for food. The limbs were contorting with cracking noises I could hear even from inside the slightly soundproof walls of the house.

As quickly as humanly possible I closed the curtains once again praying and hoping that they didn't see me. I could only imagine what they would do to me if they found me. That was when I heard knocking at the door. It was quiet at first but persistent. It would not stop going on and on over two. It started to sound like banging before the voices started. I heard my wife and children outside yelling and begging me to let them in. Blaming me for what would happen if I wasn't going to open the door for them. Tears rolled down my eyes as I slumped over the door still trying to keep as quiet as I possibly could because I knew they were dead and nothing would ever bring them back. They hadn't left me for someone else, they had died in a drunk driving incident leaving me alone. Sounds of doorbells ringing started along with it. It was all too much to bear. I knew they could smell the sadness and the stress I was facing at that moment but I didn't care. I couldn't handle it all anymore and passed out as I heard the sound described in the 9^(th) rule.

I was found in the morning alive with my shirt soaked in tears and snot from my crying the last night. Sarah had come over to check on me and when I didn't answer the door she feared the worst and got the town head to open the door. I was apparently very lucky to have passed out as they would have gotten me if I hadn't due to my emotional state. I was immediately put into therapy for this and was to stay at Sarah's house with her husband and kids for the next week until I got settled into the town as they would keep me company ensuring my safety and making sure I remembered the other rules that were soon to come for me as I was about to start my new job.
