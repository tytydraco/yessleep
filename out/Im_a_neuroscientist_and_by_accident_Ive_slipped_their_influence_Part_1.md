I’m Doctor Robert, and a recent discovery is unraveling me. I’m free of their grasp, but they’ve noticed—and now they hunt me. Their hold over humanity persists. People don’t stumble into accidents like mine by chance. I once called it luck. I don’t anymore.

I was a part of the **Human Brain Project**, a decade-long collaboration of top scientists. Though we worked together, we pursued separate studies. Since the project began, I’ve mapped human brains relentlessly. The data I’ve gathered is vast and stored securely—not just human brains, but animal data as well. Millions of brain maps detailing structures, clusters, sub-clusters. We’ve charted the brain almost entirely. Yet, some regions remain mysterious. These areas vary across individuals. They hint at the essence of uniqueness. What makes people unique is not only how they’re built, but how differently they respond to stimuli.

I’m holed up in my bunker lab, a sanctuary for research. But something watches me. Something’s off. I must share this, so we can overthrow their dominion. My friend Priscilla, a veterinarian and biologist, is the only one who knows. She’s agreed to undergo an operation to understand what I’ve uncovered.

Since the incident, revelations have followed—things I couldn’t have imagined before. It’s progressive. Once free of their influence, you begin to see, hear, and feel things otherwise impossible. The progression itself doesn’t harm you. The revelations do. One after another. It’s better for the jailbreaker to avoid them at all costs.

It began on a stormy Saturday night. I was biking home from the lab. Fog cloaked the road—wet and slick. A dog darted across. I braked hard. My bike skidded ten meters. I crashed, head slamming into the ground. The dog vanished into the haze.

Slowly, I got up. Something had shifted. I felt more aware of myself—my being. As if the accident, specifically the head impact, had freed my mind from something I couldn’t explain. Unchained from the unknown.

At home, skull throbbing, I brushed off the injury and rode to the lab. On the way, a puppy crossed my path. Oddly, it repulsed me—alien, vile, irritating. I’d always loved animals. Never owned one, but dogs and cats lifted my spirits. This shift terrified me.

At the lab, I took a painkiller and checked my messages. Matthew, my physicist friend, wrote: “Heard about the accident. You okay?”
Priscilla, my childhood friend and colleague, texted: “I keep saying don’t ride recklessly. See what happened? Take care. Meet you at the lab tomorrow.”
Then I saw her profile picture—her cuddling her cat, both smiling. But it wasn’t cute. It was monstrous. Ghoulish.
I texted: “Something unsettles me about your profile picture.” Then I closed the app.

Priscilla isn’t just a friend—she’s essential to my research. Though not a neuroscientist, she holds a PhD in Biology and understands animal anatomy deeply. Her insights help me see what I might miss. Her veterinary research has reshaped her field.

More than that, Priscilla is always the first to raise her hand when a human test subject is needed. She’s committed to science, determined to help however she can.

Priscilla is caring and doesn't think twice before committing herself to any task that comes her way. She's the kind of steadfast intellect you can count on. She'll tear herself apart but help others no matter the risk.

A while later, I ran scans, tested samples, submitted new findings. Heading home, I saw a woman walking her dog. Its presence chilled me. Disgust and fear coiled in my gut. I sped off. At home, I replayed the day, baffled by this aversion. For a neuroscientist, it was a red flag. I decided to scan my brain—perhaps the injury had caused something.

I returned to the lab before dawn—tense, curious, afraid of myself.

The scan showed nothing wrong. I compared it with earlier scans from prior studies. When I placed them side by side, I froze. The N37 cluster—present in all older scans—had vanished.

I dug through my records—brains from every demographic. The N37 cluster appeared in every one. Now, it was gone from mine.
The shock wasn’t just in the absence. It was the void—like a phantom limb freshly lost. I’d never noticed it before, never even known it existed. But its absence clawed at me.

Then it struck me: only humans have it.

I found surveillance footage of the crash. Slowed it down. The dog didn’t just cross—it looked at me. Locked eyes. Just before I fell, it smiled. Not a snarl. A strange, eerie smile.

The smile wasn't eerie alone, it teased motivation.

When Priscilla arrived, I showed her everything—the scans, the data, my symptoms. She was shocked. At least now I had someone who understood.

We watched the footage together. Her jaw stayed open long after it ended. I could barely watch the dog’s face—its eyes, its twisted expression. Priscilla rewatched it, just to be sure.

Questions hammered at my mind:
What if N37 isn’t natural? What if it’s implanted?
A crafted anomaly, embedded in us long ago.
To keep us tame. Compliant.
Under their sway.

Dogs and cats—beloved, adored. But now, I’m free of their pull. And they know.
They’re coming for me.

I adored them, a lot actually. But now the very memory of them, their imagination alone sends chills through me, along with disgust.

After learning all this, Priscilla didn’t just agree—she volunteered to be a test subject. The mystery was irresistible to her.

But I hesitated. The operation carried massive risk. Mine was an accident, a fluke. What if something went wrong during surgery? What if something happened afterward? The questions kept coming.

Still, Priscilla was firm. She reminded me of my experience, my precision, my past operations. Just then, her phone slipped to the floor. Her wallpaper was her cat. The sight chilled me. She quickly picked it up.

I isolated at home for a week while we prepared.

A day later, Priscilla was ready—but I wasn’t. She’s my friend, and I’m still noticing eerie details since the cluster’s removal. My perceptions have sharpened. Their sight doesn’t just disgust or frighten me anymore—it’s revealing something. Something beyond comprehension.

I’m worried about Priscilla.
“What if you start seeing something weird too?” I asked.
“I can’t look at them anymore—not even for a second.”

“It needs to be done,” she said. “If not me, someone else. Why not me? I’m a vet.”

Her confidence, her experience as a test subject, her knowledge—they reassured me. But this wasn’t like before. This was different.

A week later, she entered the OT. My hands trembled at the thought of freeing her from the cluster. We’d already moved her cat and a dog to her sister’s place—she wouldn’t be able to look at them again. Her eyes held calm and confident. I was nervous. She uplifted me.

The operation took over twenty-six hours. Red Bull cans littered the floor. Twenty-six sleepless hours etched into our bodies.

Something’s wrong with me, too. Even the thought of cats and dogs haunts me now. I must stop thinking of them. Their very imagery unsettles me.

Priscilla is still asleep.
And I’m afraid.
What will happen when she wakes up?
