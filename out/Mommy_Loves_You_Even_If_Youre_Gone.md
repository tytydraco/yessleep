I tuck the blankets around her, the fabric warm and soft against her small body. Her eyes flutter as she yawns, those long, dark lashes brushing her chubby cheeks. She smiles sleepily up at me, and I feel my heart squeeze with love. She looks so perfect, so full of life.

“Night, Mommy,” she mumbles, her voice a soft murmur in the quiet room.

I smile and press a gentle kiss to her forehead. 

“Mummy loves you,” I whisper, my voice barely above a breath. It’s something I tell her every night, a promise I never intend to break. She wraps her small hand around mine, her fingers warm and trusting.

“I love you too, Mommy,” she whispers back, her eyes closing as she drifts into sleep, her breathing slowing in the peacefulness of the night.

I stay a moment longer, watching her. She looks so content, so safe in her little world. I always tell myself that no matter what happens, as long as she’s with me, nothing can go wrong. 

But tonight… something feels different.

I pull myself away, stepping out of the room quietly, careful not to disturb her sleep. The house is eerily still, too still. The silence presses in on me, heavy and oppressive. 

I head down the hallway, my fingers brushing against the cool walls as I walk, the soft tap of my footsteps the only sound in the air. But then I stop.

There’s a folder on the table. I don’t know why I notice it, but I do. It wasn’t there before. 

I hesitate. There’s something in me that tells me I shouldn’t touch it, that I should leave it alone, but I can’t stop myself. I reach for it, my fingers trembling slightly. The folder is thick, the kind that holds something important, something… serious. 

I pull it open and feel a jolt of cold when I see the paper inside. It’s old, worn at the edges, yellowed with time. The ink is smudged in places, like it had been gripped too tightly by someone who didn’t want to read it, didn’t want to believe what it said.

I squint at the top of the page, my breath catching in my throat.

**“Report of Miscarriage – 12 Weeks Gestation.”**

I feel the room spin. I don’t understand. I don’t understand what I’m reading. This can’t be right. This has to be a mistake. 

But it isn’t. I can see my name at the bottom of the page. My handwriting. My signature.

I try to breathe, but the air feels thick, heavy in my lungs. The room feels smaller, as if the walls are leaning in, pressing me into this nightmare that I can't escape. 

The words blur, but I force myself to keep reading.

**“I felt it. The moment everything changed. One moment, I was pregnant. I could feel her, the life inside me. Then, the next moment, there was nothing but pain. A searing pain that consumed me, taking everything away... All I could do was watch as the blood ran down my legs. The realization hit me slowly, like the crushing weight of a thousand unspoken truths. I had lost her. My baby. My little girl.”**

My vision swims. I can’t breathe. I can’t think. My hand shakes as I hold the paper, my fingers barely gripping it.

**“They told me it would be okay. They told me I could try again. But I knew. I knew the moment I saw the empty ultrasound screen that my daughter was gone. She was never going to breathe. She was never going to smile. She was never going to look at me with those eyes that made me feel whole.”**

I gasp, the room tilting around me. I can’t stop reading, but I don’t want to read anymore. 

**“I begged the doctors to save her. I begged them. But there was nothing they could do. She was never going to be real. She was never going to be mine. She was just a figment, a dream, something that never should have existed.”**

The paper slips from my hands, fluttering to the floor. 

I fall to my knees, my chest heaving with silent sobs, my body shaking uncontrollably. My daughter… my beautiful, perfect daughter… was never real.

It was all a lie.

I feel something shift in the air. A whisper. A faint sound, like a dream pulling at the edges of my consciousness. 

“Mommy…”

The voice. *Her voice.*

I jerk to my feet, my heart pounding in my chest. I hear it again, closer this time, the soft sound of her calling my name.

I scramble down the hallway, my feet unsteady beneath me. The house is darker now, the shadows stretching longer, colder. 

I reach her door, my hand trembling as I push it open. 

And then I freeze. 

The bed is empty. The room is empty. 

Her toys are neatly arranged in the corner. The pink walls are still, untouched. Everything is still, everything is… *wrong.*

“Mommy?”

I hear her again, but this time it’s not from the room. It’s coming from somewhere deeper, somewhere farther away. I spin around, my mind racing, my breath caught in my throat. 

I run down the hallway, frantic now. 

“Mommy! Where are you, Mommy?”

Her voice calls out to me from the depths of the house, but no matter where I go, I can’t find her. 

I reach the kitchen. Empty. 

I hear the sound of my own breathing, too loud in the silence. 

I slump to the floor, my back against the cold cabinets. I can still hear her, faint but clear. 

“Mommy…”

I pull my knees to my chest, my tears falling freely now. 

I should have known. I should have felt it. 

She was never real. She never was. 

The warmth of her presence, the softness of her hugs, the way her small hands always seemed to find mine—it was all a dream. A lie I created to fill the empty space where she should have been.

The paper. The truth.

I whisper it aloud, but it feels like a confession, a betrayal.

“She was never real.”

And as the echo of my words fills the empty house, I hear her voice one last time, distant, fading.

“Mommy?”

But I can’t answer her. I can’t reach her.

Because she’s gone.

She was never really here.
