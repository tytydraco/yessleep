It’s been a few days since my last update.

I didn’t post right away because I needed distance. I needed to see if things would settle if I stopped reacting to every sound, every misplaced object. I needed to know whether what happened was an episode or the beginning of something that was going to keep happening whether I watched for it or not.

I keep telling myself I’ll go back to work tomorrow. I’ve been telling myself that for days. I stayed in the apartment the whole time. 

I slept when I could. Short stretches. Never deeply. I kept the lights on at night. I kept the same routine during the day. I didn’t go back down to the laundry room. I didn’t sit on the couch for too long. I tried to stay present.

For a while, nothing happened.

This morning, I woke up feeling strangely clear. Not rested, exactly, but steady. Like the fog had lifted just enough for me to think straight again.

I went into the kitchen to make coffee.

The sink was empty.

That stopped me.

I stood there staring at it, trying to remember when I’d washed the mug I’d used the night before. I couldn’t. I opened the cupboard.

The mug was there. Clean. Dry. Put away.

I checked the rest of the kitchen.

All the dishes were done.

I don’t mean rinsed and left to dry. I mean washed, dried, and stacked the way I always do it. Plates in order. Cutlery sorted correctly. Even the pan I’d used two nights in a row was back where it belonged.

My trash can was empty.

Not “emptier than I remembered.” Empty.

The liner had been replaced.

I felt that cold, hollow feeling start up again, the same one I’d felt every other time something didn’t line up.

I tried to explain it away. Muscle memory. Habit. Something done without thinking.

Except I couldn’t find a single moment where it fit.

I checked the bathroom next.

The sink was clean. The mirror had been wiped down.

Someone had taken a shower. The mirror was still faintly fogged at the edges.

I hadn’t.

I stood there with my hands on the edge of the sink, trying to feel grounded in my body. Trying to notice where I was, what time it was, what I could remember.

There was no headache. No dizziness. No sense that I’d blacked out.

I went back into the living room.

The couch cushions were straightened. The blanket folded.

Everything looked normal.

That was the problem.

None of this felt rushed. None of it felt panicked. Whoever had done these things hadn’t been confused or disoriented. They hadn’t left half-finished tasks or signs of interruption.

They’d taken their time to make it just right.

I sat down slowly and tried to reconstruct the order of it. Eating. Cleaning. Taking out the trash. Showering. Putting things away.

It wasn’t random.

It followed a routine.

One that looked uncomfortably familiar.

That’s when it hit me that this was much worse than finding folded laundry or hearing a washing machine through the pipes.

Those things could be blamed on someone else. An intruder. Something external.

This couldn’t.

Because whoever did this knew where everything went.

They knew how I lived.

And they were comfortable enough here to clean up after themselves.

I’m writing this now from the same spot on the couch where I’ve been spending most of my time. The apartment is quiet. No humming. No rattling from the pipes.

Everything is exactly where it should be.

And that terrifies me.

Because whatever happened during that missing time wasn’t random.

It wasn’t careless.

Someone was living normally in my apartment.

And I don’t remember being here at all.
