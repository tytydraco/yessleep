If there really was a God, He wouldn’t let this happen to me.

Or maybe I’m being a little dramatic, but there’s absolutely no way that I’ll ever be able to make the meeting now. It takes seven hours to get to London, and, obviously, I planned to have three to spare before it started, but with the fourth delay of this fucking plane, there’s no chance I’ll ever be able to make it. So, I’m just sitting here. Waiting. I’m sure there’s gonna be another two, three, four, ten delays before they finally decide that they’re comfortable enough to take off. At this point, though it won’t actually happen for six hours, the impossibility of ever being able to make the meeting has taken away all of the stress I have about missing it. My mind has already come to terms with its inevitability, so it almost feels like it’s already happened. It’s funny, I guess, how that works. It’s almost like time-traveling.

It’s still bullshit, though. I’m amazed that airlines even let this happen anymore. You’d think that with the huge dropoff in people actually wanting to fly nowadays, they wouldn’t be doing anything to have people refuse their service for something that actually makes sense. I think I saw on the news the other day that in the last five years, something like forty percent of people who used to fly fully refuse to anymore. And most everybody they interviewed had that same stupid superstitious answer - The Disappearances. People have been saying it so much now that it almost makes it sound like it’s a real thing; like it’s anything more than statistics. Flying has always been a risk. You’re in a metal tube ten miles high going three hundred miles an hour, obviously, you’re not gonna be as safe as you would be hiding in your living room. But all transportation is dangerous! Cars slam into other cars way more often. Boats can sink just like a plane can fall. Trains can collide and derail. I mean, for God’s sake, even a horse can hoof-punt you in the chest and that’s lights out, too. At the end of the day, I’d rather have a guy whose job it is to transport people in something doing exactly that in a wide-open space. It must just be the idea of a plane crash that gets people. I couldn’t imagine what it’s like, but honestly, of all the ways to die while trying to get from point A to point B, a plane crash is, on average, the quickest and most painless way to go.

“The Disappearances”. It’s so dramatic. So science-fictiony. So needlessly ornamental. Everybody wants their life to be a movie, but it’s not. Life is mundane and boring and just something to do before we die. But still, for most, their emotions get the best of them, and they let themselves think up these wild stories and theories for things that have perfectly rational solutions. Then, they let those stories control their lives. It’s sad. The planes aren’t disappearing, they’re crashing. It happens. And if a plane crashes over the ocean, then of course you’re not gonna find many remnants. I suppose it is odd that there are seemingly more planes crashing now than maybe there were before, but again, there’s a rational explanation. The news gets views by telling stories that scare us, and since they see just how well these plane-crashing reports have caught on, they’re just playing them up. They’ll say anything to make sure people stay on their channel. It’s how they make money, and it’s what they’ve always done. In fact, I’m sure no more plane accidents are happening now than there were for the past sixty years. The only difference is that now, we get the privilege of hearing about all of them.

I don’t get it. I don’t get people. There are so many other important things to worry about. Do you want to hear about something that has actually been on the rise in the last five years? Global catastrophes. There have been more earthquakes, more tsunamis, and more instances of crazy weather all over the globe. But no, the media can’t paint that into a weird “everything is connected” theory to force feed into the mouths of people who want to be afraid of a concrete enemy. A concrete entity. I mean, you should hear some of these stupid fucking stories people come up with. I’ve heard the reason for these plane crashes being attributed to everything from Russians killing people from the West for fun, to aliens kidnapping us for probing, to the Illuminati doing… vague Illuminati stuff. The Illuminati theory doesn’t have a lot of development behind it. It seems if somebody just says that the Illuminati is behind something, then that’s good enough for a lot of people. I don’t know.

They delayed the plane again. Jesus Christ.

I walked over to the customer service booth - an oxymoron, more often than not - and had my choice of three near-identical-looking brunettes who all had the permanently-etched fake smile which was part of their uniform. It’s just one of those things that people in society do to make other people in society think that they actually care about their problems.

Anyway, I chose the middle one, like I’m sure most do. She was the youngest, and her smile was the most convincing. The others’ real opinions of their jobs and the people they constantly had to deal with were evidently clear in their dead eyes. I stepped up to the booth and returned her fake smile with one of my own.

“Hi, I’m flying to London on LCT1890, and it just had its fifth delay. I was wondering if you knew why?”

“Let me check on that for you, sir.” She started clicking away at her computer, valiantly looking up an answer to a question that she couldn’t care less about.

“Well, sir, it seems that air control has been combining a few flights in order to have one full plane that flies to Europe. A lot of passengers have had direct flights to different European cities canceled, and instead, they’ll have a layover in London. So, the delays are simply air control consolidating more flights into yours until the plane is full.”

She said that like it made any sense.

“Well, that’s… weird. Isn’t that weird?”

“We apologize, sir”, she responded.

“No, what I’m saying is that doesn’t make sense. Every flight for years has been a quarter-filled. Why is this one different?” I asked her this knowing exactly the response that I was gonna get. Honestly, it was more myself thinking out loud than it was posing a question to somebody who I believed could provide any help.

“I don’t know, sir”, she said, in the same sweet voice that she’s been performing with for years.

“Sweetheart, I need to get to London. I have a very important meeting that I’ve already missed, but I may be able to salvage something of the business relationship if I’m able to get there. Do you have any information or idea about when this flight is gonna leave?” I asked. The forced politeness in my voice was gone. It disappeared in an instant. Patience is a weakness of mine when it comes to talking with people who have no idea what’s ever going on.

“I don’t know, sir. The airline sends its apologies and will compensate, of course, for any long-term delays, but as of right now, all I can tell you is that the flight will likely board soon.”

It was perfect, the perfect cookie-cutter corporate conclusion that simultaneously gives the impression that they’re sorry about how their fuck-up affects you, while also keeping just a far enough distance away from the situation to make it seem like it was up to the will of a god, or something like that. Ridiculous.

I walked back to my seat and just stared at the departure board. I saw four other European-bound flights already canceled, so I guess the lady was telling the truth about wanting to fill the plane up. That didn’t make it any less weird, though. What made this flight so special to have it packed to the brim? I guess the only thing to do, though, was wait. I mean, five flights in one at this point? The plane must be filled soon.

I called my business partner, explained the situation, and told him that my arrival was at the will of some higher power. He laughed. He was clearly upset, but he knew that it wasn’t anybody’s fault, so he had no real reason to get personally upset with me. Still, we were both annoyed and it wasn’t hard to tell. I hung up, settled into my chair, and just stared at the board, waiting for my flight to be called.

Three hours later, I was finally sitting in my cramped seat, watching the flight attendants play their game of charades to a filled plane of people who weren’t even pretending to pay attention. When I looked up from my phone, they were showing how to blow up the life jackets, and the next time I looked up, they were gone.

I glanced around at everybody else in the cabin and they were all wearing the same beleaguered face that I assumed I was. Everybody stared straight down, trying to distract themselves from the pre-flight jitters with whatever they brought. Middle-aged people were on their phones all playing different variations of the same mind-numbing game that involved putting colorful shapes into groups with other colorful shapes. Old people were reading books. Young people were pretending to read books. It was the usual.

When the jets pushed me into an inseparable blob with my overpriced seat, I got the usual flutters in my stomach. I don’t know why that happens. It’s one of the few times where no matter how rational I try to speak internally, I can’t seem to fully quell my reaction. Perhaps it’s the body’s natural realization that if anything were to happen on the flight, then its fate was, from that point on, set in stone. This time, it was worse though. Not overwhelmingly worse, I wasn’t breathing into a paper bag like the overweight millennial beside me, but it was more than the usual slight sink in my stomach. It has to be because I’m just so tired. I’ve been living in an airport for half a day at this point. My back was stiff, my neck was sore, and my attitude was already negative - that’s probably why. Or maybe it was because I was flying internationally? That’s possible. Usually, I fly domestically. Or maybe - goddammit - maybe all those stupid fucking conspiracy theories are subconsciously getting to me. It makes no sense, I know it makes no sense, but I guess, to some extent, if you hear something enough times then it could get to you. Regardless of the reason, the fact was that we were already in the air, so worrying wouldn’t do me any good.

As we drifted farther and farther from New York, and as the rigid metal ground turned to a smooth blue, I was starting to get disgruntled. The feeling hadn’t gone. Here I was, still stewing in my worry. I kept trying to explain to myself the pointlessness of my fear, but my usual semi-nihilistic pep talk didn’t do me any good this time. I needed a distraction. Grabbing my carry-on, I ripped out my folder and started to bury myself in the notes and statistics that I needed to be an expert on for this whatever was left of this meeting, but it didn’t work. After tossing it back into my bag, I pulled out the book I’d been reading instead, the new Jordan Peterson - he usually sucks me right in. I tried to force myself into it - to read every word with the silent dedication of a monk, but I couldn’t. My mind was flying. Somehow, in fact, my nerves were getting worse. My stomach was turning. I was getting to the point where I couldn’t even take a deep breath anymore. In a final attempt to distract myself, I put my headphones on and listened to the music that usually brings me a degree of comfort - Paul Simon. He always calms me down.

Except now, for some fucking reason. Practically making my ears bleed with the most uplifting chord progression of all time, all I can think about is the sinking pit in my stomach. I kept turning the volume up, and my phone was yelling at me, telling me that, as long as I want to be deaf by thirty-five, I should keep it up, but I didn’t stop. At that point, I was doing shit just to do shit - desperately trying to distract myself by doing a thousand things at a time, but nothing was working. I’m sure, to everybody around me, I looked like an idiot - like one of those circus monkeys playing the drums while riding a unicycle - but I didn’t care. My darting eyes, bleeding ears, and restless hands were being tortured as I was comparing the statistics while blasting You Can Call Me Al while staring at the least unattractive flight attendant bend down to get the loud twelve-year-old his Pringles while then jumping over to my book while watching the little blinking animated airplane sail across the Atlantic on the flight tracker while trying to - wait. The flight tracker. That’s weird. We aren’t going toward England. We were, but now we’re not. Why’d we take that hard left? Am I wrong? No. There’s no way. That’s London, that’s New York, and that’s not a straight line between the two. It’s not even close. We’re heading north - like, almost directly north.

By now, the flight attendant and her tank stuffed with chips and soda came to my seat, and she bent down to me. I threw my headphones off.

“Anything to eat, sir? Anything to dr-”

“Where are we going?”, I was blunt, and I know I sounded rude, but I didn’t care. I didn’t have the patience to put on the act of pleasantries before, and now, after my stomach felt like it’d been in a dogfight for the past forty-five minutes, I certainly didn’t feel like faking it.

“London, sir”, she said, clearly confused.

I pointed to the flight tracker.

“That’s London”, I made a circle with my finger on the screen. The screen fought back with somewhat intense friction, no doubt due to the hundreds of little kids who switched between the insides of their noses and the chair-mounted iPad in front of them. Gross. “And that’s us. Why aren’t we going to London?”

The stewardess, having watched my presentation, also seemed somewhat confused as her company-mandated smile faded, but only for a split second. Her pearly whites and forcefully-crinkled eyes returned, and she looked back at me.

“Well, sir, I can check with the Captain, but it seems as though we’ve just taken a slight detour, likely due to weather or changing flight patterns or something of the like.”

I looked at her as she looked at me, and for some reason, at that moment, I didn’t believe her. I’m sure that she believed herself - I mean, her answer was perfectly reasonable - but, again, just at that moment, I didn’t have any faith in the verity of what she said.

That lasted only a second thought as a semblance of rationality returned to my mind.

“Yes. Yes, of course. That makes sense. Thank you.”

I turned back to my seat and put my headphones back on as she continued down the aisle with her cart. What was going on with me? I was turning into some type of paranoid maniac. Flying was a vital and regular part of my job, and I’ve grown as accustomed to it as I have driving a car, but now, for some reason, I’m reacting like a seven-year-old. Should the pilots give me a little wings pin? Should they let me see the cockpit? Would it help me if they called me brave for getting on the flight? It’s ridiculous. I’m spiraling deeper and deeper into this looming sense of dread that is solely a product of my mind. I don’t know what I have to do, but I need to do something.

Suddenly, a hand grabbed my shoulder. I screamed.

Following up the arm, I saw the terrified face of the air stewardess from before. Both of her eyebrows were positioned at the same angled slant of worried confusion as she stared at me for a second, along with most everybody else in the cabin.

“Sir, are you okay?”

I admit I was embarrassed.

“Yes. Yeah, sorry. I don’t know what that was. I was just in my own world, I suppose. You scared me.”

“Sir, I just came to ask you to turn your music down a bit. Some other passengers have had complaints.”

At that moment, I realized just how loud Paul Simon was singing Cecilia. He was practically drowning out the sound of the engine.

“Oh. Of course! Of course. Sorry.” I quickly paused the music, and put my headphones away entirely. I don’t know what was happening to me or where these nerves were coming from. I was starting to feel like a madman, to be honest. It must be the whole day just catching up with me, and then my stupid brain feeding my sense of dread like a farmer fattening a pig. I put everything away, in fact, my papers, my book, my phone - everything. Then, I took one last look at the flight tracker, seeing that we still haven’t turned back on course and getting again that initial, familiar shock, before reasoning with myself against the ridiculousness of my newly-acquired hysteria and closing my eyes for a nap. I hope sleep will be able to shake off whatever this is going on with me

Though it never felt like it, I must have gone to sleep. It was one of those sleeps where you always felt like you were trying too hard and where you could never get comfortable, but eventually, when you look at the clock, you realize it’s been an hour.

I didn’t feel any different. In fact, I think I may have felt worse. The knots in my stomach were still tying up every breath I took. I closed my eyes, not to sleep this time, but just to focus. Now seemed like a good time as any to try meditation, I figured. A few deep breaths in, a few deep breaths out, and absolutely no change.

“Hey.”

I looked to my left and saw the bug-eyed overweight millennial who was hyperventilating at takeoff staring at me.

“You okay?” He asked.

Usually, in this situation, like every other time somebody asks you that question, I’d say, “I’m fine,” and leave it at that.

For some reason, though, I found myself answering honestly. Maybe it was due to the non-stop mental barrage that I’d been taking since I walked into the airport eleven hours prior, but I didn’t respond with the usual. Instead, I told him the truth.

“No. I don’t know what’s wrong. I’ve had this sinking pit in my stomach since takeoff. I don’t know what’s the matter with me, this has never happened before.”

“I’m the same way,” he responded, “I don’t know what’s going on with me. I feel like I’m in danger.”

Exactly. That’s exactly what I was feeling. I didn’t know why, but I felt threatened. Before, I thought it was just anxiety, but it’s developed into much more since then. I was trying to figure out why - what the rational explanation was for this almost primordial fear in my heart - when another voice jutted in.

“You boys, too?”

An older woman, around seventy years old, spoke to us from the end of our row.

"The second we took off - and I don’t know why - I got this huge wave of stress, like when there’s a noise in your kitchen at three in the morning,” she said, “It’s almost like something is going to happen - and I know that it’s probably nothing, but still… it feels like something will. Something bad.”

“Do you normally feel like this on flights?” I asked the two of them.

The millennial responded first, “I’ve never been a huge fan of flying - especially with all the weird stuff that’s been happening the past few years. All those disappearances. But I have to do it for my job,” he looked down, “I want a new job.”

Great. Just what I needed. One of those conspiracy-believing nutjobs to propagate whatever weird episode I was going through with his crazy-person energy.

The older lady spoke next, “I never get like this. I feel like I’m going to get almost hysterical. I’ve been flying regularly for fifty years, and I’ve never felt like I do now.” She then addressed only the millennial, “And it’s not because of any of that conspiracy theory nonsense. You shouldn’t believe any of that stuff.”

I smiled for a second as the woman, even when terrified, still took the time to lecture some stupid kid - it was a welcome break from the slow buildup of dread since takeoff. As I settled back into my seat, though, and thought more about their points of view, the feelings returned in full force. Sure, the younger kid feeling nervous was fully understandable. He believed all that fear-mongering on the news to his core, so obviously, he’d feel uncomfortable on one of the longer flights one can take. The older woman, though... The more I thought about what she said, the worse my fear grew. She wasn’t a nutjob. She was a veteran flier. Even in the 80s when hijackings happened every other week and all airplanes were practically held together with duct tape and chewing gum, she wasn’t afraid of flying. So why now?

The ding of the SEATBELTS ON light as it flicked alive shook me like a gunshot. At the moment, I was somewhat happy about that, though. It forced me out of whatever emotional spiral I was falling down in my own head. I’m sure, to everybody else, I looked like a maniac in a trance. Somewhat embarrassing, I figured, since this was the second time in a single flight that I would have looked like that after I shrieked at the attendant’s hand. My eyes shyly began to scan the other rows, sheepishly hidden under my eyebrows, but I didn’t see any confused looks towards me. No. I would have preferred that. Instead, I didn’t see a single pair of eyes in my direction. In fact, everybody was looking at the same spot - down. I looked around all the rows I could see from my seat, and everybody was hanging their head, almost in defeat, as they stared fearfully directly down into their sweaty, clasping palms.

Everybody felt as I did. Without even thinking about the movement, I quickly shot up and looked around at even more passengers, and sure enough, they were all acting the same way.

I didn’t know what was going on. This whole flight has been too strange for my taste. Why did, for the first time in half a decade, this flight have to be filled to the brim? Why am I so afraid of something I can’t find a rational reason for? And why is everybody else the same way?

Sitting back in my seat, I buckled my seatbelt and found myself tightening it to such an extent that it could have drawn blood as if - if whatever subconscious fears these were ended up being well-founded - this thin band of polyester would save me.

I just want to be in London. I just want to feel the ground again. Hell, I might even end up being one of those dramatics who applauds once the plane landed.

How close were we? We’ve been in the air for three hours at this point. We have to be close. I flicked the chair-mounted screen ahead of me back on and stared as it booted up, anxiously awaiting for the flight tracker to brazenly make its reappearance.

I wish I didn’t.

When did I ask the flight attendant why we turned? Two and a half hours ago? It had to be. That’s what the clock said, after all. I still just can’t believe I slept that long.

And why haven’t we turned back? We’re halfway up through Canada. I still wanted to believe that the “weird weather” excuse that the flight attendant mustered up was the truth, but I couldn’t. It just didn’t make any sense. Was I on the wrong flight?

No. That’s ridiculous.

I didn’t like that I was at the point of confusion now where my body’s go-to rationale was that every move I’d made in the last half day was the wrong one, but besides that, I genuinely couldn’t think of a single reason why we were heading exactly perpendicular to our destination, and practically have been from right out of the gate.

The flight attendant that I talked to before about this was at the front of the plane. I poked my head out of my little personal bubble, over the millennial’s lap, and into the aisle, hoping to get her attention.. Donning the cartoonishly confused expression one does when a stranger has an answer to their question and waving an open hand every time she looked even somewhat toward my direction, I silently and anxiously awaited the however-many seconds it would take until I might get an answer to my question - though I knew I’d probably get the same response.

It took a few attempts - a few somewhat embarrassing failed waves - but soon enough she saw me and started towards me, but only for a few steps. Interrupting her walk was the opening of a door behind her - the door to the cockpit - and out stepped the pilot. He took the attention of the flight attendant, and she gave me a hasty wave as if to say “I’ll get to you in a second, esteemed passenger!”

She spoke with the pilot, or rather, he spoke to her, and, being only able to read their expressions, it didn’t seem to be of something good. Though he seemed a strong man - well-built, sharp jaw, light stubble, straight stature - he struggled to maintain eye contact. Instead, most of the time, he stared sheepishly and almost regretfully down at his feet. What was he saying? Whatever it was, the flight attendant was not happy to hear it. Intermittently, she raised her shoulders in a physical accompaniment to her trying to challenge whatever he was saying, but it was always bested by the beleaguered pilot’s single open hand silencing her as he continued to fight through whatever terrible things he had to say.

Without giving her a chance to say whatever she was itching to for their entire interaction, the pilot returned to the cockpit, quickly closing the door behind him. I watched her as she seemed to struggle to comprehend whatever she was just told, and also waited to begin my second performance of trying to get her attention, just in case she forgot. With a quick bolt, she began to dart down the aisle toward me. Her company-mandated smile was nowhere to be found, instead, it was replaced with tight lips covering her biting jaw. I waved to get her attention as, though I know she just got some bad news, I still wanted an answer as to where the hell we were flying to if, apparently, not London. As I’ve had more time to process possibilities in the back of my mind, I realized that it must be a change in the itinerary. We’re probably landing somewhere else and have a layover somewhere before we get another flight to London. It made little sense, yes, but after all the chaos that this flight has been stuffed with thus far, I wouldn’t be surprised.

She was about halfway to me at this point, and she still hadn’t looked at my signal. Her eyes were fixed straight ahead, but it was clear that they were looking at nothing in particular, whatever she was concerned with at the moment was inside of her head. Purposefully or not, it looked as though she was going to ignore me completely. Though I’m sure that’s common for the timid millennial to my left, it wasn’t for me.

I opened my mouth to verbally get her attention but was interrupted. In fact, it was she that interrupted me. About three-quarters of the way to my seat, a sharp whimper escaped her pressed lips as if it couldn’t be held in anymore, and it was followed by the sudden watering of her eyes. She brushed right past me as I sat silent, surprised by her sudden emotion, and by that time tears had started to freely flow down her rosy cheeks. Flight attendants, I thought, were trained to be nothing but pleasant and helpful, and she was up to a minute ago. What did that pilot tell her? Perhaps she and he had a relationship of some sort, and, for some reason, he elected now as the best time to break it off. Or maybe he got some bad news from the ground that concerned her or her family.

But no. I didn’t buy that. I saw her eyes, and they were the same eyes that I saw worn by every passenger on this plane. They were fearful. Immediately, my mind began to race again. I wondered if she too had the initial dreadful emotions at takeoff, but was just able to hide it better since she’d done just that for so long as a way to make a living. And maybe now that she wore them, the shared fear from everybody seated in the cabin was more rational than I thought.

My puzzled gaze followed her to the rear of the plane where I saw her speaking with the other attendants. Now, the parts had switched. She presumed the role of the pilot, telling all of the others the same bad news that she had just heard. Their faces were all the same - looks of shock, of disbelief, of fear, of defeat. Then, one of the three listening attendants began to cry. A powerful wail suddenly tore out of her throat before she silenced it almost immediately, but it was just the impetus needed to cause the others to join her. Urged by one another’s misery, the circuitous display of sniffling soon turned into shortening breaths which eventually turned into full, yet stifled, waterworks. As I stared, almost hypnotized by the confusing nature of it all, one of them caught my unwanted eye through her blurry vision and quickly snagged the dangling curtain between us and pulled it taught, separating the main cabin from their little pod in the back.

I turned back straight in my seat. Now, though I didn’t know what would happen, it felt so certain that something would that my dread seemed to subside. It’s like my mind had already come to terms with its inevitability. Quite honestly, it felt like it had already happened.

It’s funny, I guess, how that works. It’s almost like time-traveling.

For a few minutes, I sat silently in my seat, fully succumbing to my new feelings of defeat. I looked around the cabin now and then and saw the same worried expressions as before from each of the passengers. I suppose, in some type of twisted way, I was the lucky one now. The other passengers hadn’t seen the whole ordeal in the back, so they were still stuck in anxious limbo, whereas I had entirely crossed the threshold into utter hopelessness.

Despite this, it was still a bit unsettling to see the flight attendants now walk, or I’d even use the word “mope”,  around with grim, stone faces and dim, floor-pointed eyes. Their makeup had morphed with the teardrops running through it and dried into a new pattern of permanent self-pity, but the crying itself had stopped. Over the next ten minutes, I saw three different people meekly and confusedly attempt to hail one of them, only to be completely ignored; however, while I was shunned due to emotional urgency to tell the others something important, these others were out of sheer indifference. The attendants just didn’t care, like they just gave up. Eventually, the passengers all - like it was hive knowledge - just stopped asking. The cabin was a vacuum of sound for the next forty-five minutes.

I gazed through the window for most of it, watching as the sea below slowly - almost painstakingly - became less and less liquid in its nature and was dotted with more and more splashes of solid bright white. The flight tracker confirmed that we were still heading straight north, but I didn’t even have to bother to look at it. I don’t know why I didn’t feel the urge to try and courageously take control of the plane in order to save myself and all of the passengers as I thought I always would have in a moment like this. It’s a situation that every man thinks about from time to time - one of those weird thoughts that nobody talks about but everybody has. When you’re actually living in the scene that you’ve painted in your dreams, you never have the gall that you thought you would have. I guess, deeply rooted in whatever the subconscious thought was that was also causing this dread to begin with, I knew that it was pointless.

Suddenly - a shriek from the front of the plane. Then, the cockpit door flew open as a flight attendant wantonly burst through it. The only thing that shot up quicker than me were the hairs on the back of my neck. It was clear that she just had another traumatic experience, except this one seemed much more visceral. Instead of trying to fight her emotions as she did when she last spoke with the captain, she donned them brazenly through her erratic dash down the aisle while ignoring the occasional ask about her well-being.

Something happened in there, I instantly knew, and it was much more than just a bad conversation.

Though my body decided before my mind fully comprehended it, I began walking towards the cockpit for myself. I didn’t know what was happening, but with the crushing fear returning, I suppose, so did my desire to understand what was going on. Everybody else on this plane can just sit here and take whatever horrible fate awaits us sitting down, but I wouldn’t. As I stood tall in the aisle, I took a final, quick peek at the stewardesses in the back to see if they’d have any qualms with my standing - if I’d have to prepare to cause quite the disruptive scene as I pressed on to the cockpit while they tried to stop me. I had the headstart, I suppose, but still, anybody rushing for the control room of the plane while getting shouted at by those trying to stop them would almost certainly face some type of obstacle from at least one of the passengers that blocked them from the captain’s room.

As I looked at them in the rear of the plane, I made direct eye contact with one of them - the one that just sprinted down the aisle. Within half a second, I had to consider all the possibilities. Should I just sit down? Should I make a mad dash for the cockpit and just try to fight through any obstacles in the way? The latter would almost certainly land me in prison - not a great look. But then, was it worth it? I knew something was going on within the minds of everybody on the plane, but was that just it? Within the minds?

Fortunately, or unfortunately, I had my decision made for me. As I held the gaze with the stewardess for the two or three seconds that I thought about all of the possibilities, her arm reached out towards that little curtain that separates us from them and, as she pulled it taught, her eyes of panic were slightly, almost imperceptibly, infiltrated by total and utter carelessness.

It’s interesting how intense emotions can get. Just when I thought my fear was at its limit, that look made it all the worse.

I thought about this for only a second before making my first step toward the cockpit.

For a few minutes, I sat silently in my seat, fully succumbing to my new feelings of defeat. I looked around the cabin now and then and saw the same worried expressions as before from each of the passengers. I suppose, in some type of twisted way, I was the lucky one now. The other passengers hadn’t seen the whole ordeal in the back, so they were still stuck in anxious limbo, whereas I had entirely crossed the threshold into utter hopelessness.

Despite this, it was still a bit unsettling to see the flight attendants now walk, or I’d even use the word “mope”,  around with grim, stone faces and dim, floor-pointed eyes. Their makeup had morphed with the teardrops running through it and dried into a new pattern of permanent self-pity, but the crying itself had stopped. Over the next ten minutes, I saw three different people meekly and confusedly attempt to hail one of them, only to be completely ignored; however, while I was shunned due to emotional urgency to tell the others something important, these others were out of sheer indifference. The attendants just didn’t care, like they just gave up. Eventually, the passengers all - like it was hive knowledge - just stopped asking. The cabin was a vacuum of sound for the next forty-five minutes.

I gazed through the window for most of it, watching as the sea below slowly - almost painstakingly - became less and less liquid in its nature and was dotted with more and more splashes of solid bright white. The flight tracker confirmed that we were still heading straight north, but I didn’t even have to bother to look at it. I don’t know why I didn’t feel the urge to try and courageously take control of the plane in order to save myself and all of the passengers as I thought I always would have in a moment like this. It’s a situation that every man thinks about from time to time - one of those weird thoughts that nobody talks about but everybody has. When you’re actually living in the scene that you’ve painted in your dreams, you never have the gall that you thought you would have. I guess, deeply rooted in whatever the subconscious thought was that was also causing this dread to begin with, I knew that it was pointless.

Suddenly - a shriek from the front of the plane. Then, the cockpit door flew open as a flight attendant wantonly burst through it. The only thing that shot up quicker than me were the hairs on the back of my neck. It was clear that she just had another traumatic experience, except this one seemed much more visceral. Instead of trying to fight her emotions as she did when she last spoke with the captain, she donned them brazenly through her erratic dash down the aisle while ignoring the occasional ask about her well-being.

Though my body decided before my mind fully comprehended it, I began walking towards the cockpit for myself. I didn’t know what was happening, but with the crushing fear returning, I suppose, so did my desire to understand what was going on. Everybody else on this plane can just sit here and take whatever horrible fate awaits us sitting down, but I wouldn’t. As I stood tall in the aisle, I took a final, quick peek at the stewardesses in the back to see if they’d have any qualms with my standing - if I’d have to prepare to cause quite the disruptive scene as I pressed on to the cockpit while they tried to stop me. I had the headstart, I suppose, but still, anybody rushing for the control room of the plane while getting shouted at by those trying to stop them would almost certainly face some type of obstacle from at least one of the passengers that blocked them from the captain’s room.

As I looked at them in the rear of the plane, I made direct eye contact with one of them - the one that just sprinted down the aisle. Within half a second, I had to consider all the possibilities. Should I just sit down? Should I make a mad dash for the cockpit and just try to fight through any obstacles in the way? The latter would almost certainly land me in prison - not a great look. But then, was it worth it? I knew something was going on within the minds of everybody on the plane, but was that just it? Within the minds?

Fortunately, or unfortunately, I had my decision made for me. As I held the gaze with the stewardess for the two or three seconds that I thought about all of the possibilities, her arm reached out towards that little curtain that separates us from them and, as she pulled it taught, her eyes of panic were slightly, almost imperceptibly, infiltrated by total and utter carelessness.

It’s interesting how intense emotions can get. Just when I thought my fear was at its limit, that look made it all the worse.

I thought about this for only a second before making my first step toward the cockpit.

Not one person stopped me as I boldly flew toward the pilot’s room. Some looked at me, and, of those, some did so in confusion, but nobody did as much as say a word. I reached the door more easily than getting to my seat at boarding. As I walked into the pilot’s territory, I stared back towards the rows and rows of passengers who now, even those who before were watching me make my move, were all staring down.

There was, however, at the back of the plane, one man who was looking at me in confused anger. I didn’t hold his gaze for long, as if, by not looking at him, he wouldn’t investigate any further why a random guy was going for an unannounced one-on-one with the two people in charge of the lives of everybody on this plane. The last thing I saw before the door shut was the man, still staring, but standing up. I had limited time.

When I finally turned to the two pilots, I found myself with the same terror that the stewardess had left with only a minute earlier.

They were dead.
