Part 2 – The Gas Station   
  
The rain pelted against the gas station as the station attendant led me back into the main shop, filling me in on what had happened to his brother two years ago.    
  
“My name is Philips. Steven Philips. My brother was into camping and small-game hunting. He would go out for weeks at a time, living off the land as much as he could. He was out west when he came across some tracks he had never seen before”, he explained, as he looked out the station windows into the downpour beyond the stations' forecourt, his eyes holding a mix of determination and grief.   
  
“He sent me some pictures, asked if I’d ever come across anything like it. I hadn’t. For days he would come across these tracks, never seeing the creature that made them. He noticed at times the tracks would change in size and shape slightly, and a few times would go from quadrupedal to bipedal. Walking on all four legs to then walking on two legs that is”    
  
Steven flipped the close sign on the door and locked it, then started walking over to the front counter.   
  
“He logged its movements, took photos and videos, and every night would send it all over to me. I didn’t think much of it. Until he called me one night.”    
  
Steven proceeded to flick the light switches by the counter, and section by section the lights around the station, starting with the fuel signs outside, shut off, until all that was left on was a few downlights in the station.    
  
 “It was raining, a downpour like tonight. I think it prefers the wet. There had been a knock at the door of his cabin, which he had found odd. The cabin was deep in the woods, and it was late at night, but he figured a camper may have gotten turned around. He went to the door and peeked out the window, and standing there was an old lady, dressed for fucking Sunday church. Straight away, alarm bells rang. No way was an old lady looking like that going to turn up on your doorstep. He asked her what she wanted, and he said her eyes just turned black and she said, you, in the deepest, gruffest voice he has heard.”   
  
I followed Steven as we walked out the back of the station, through the storeroom, and opened the rear door. Next to the dumpsters was an old, green van. He lifted his gun and looked out into the darkness, eyes full of focus as he scanned the area. Then he stepped out into the rain, motioning for me to follow him, and crept towards his van. His eyes never stopped scanning the area as he continued.   
  
“My brother grabbed his gun and fired a few shots through the door at the creature. He must have hit it at least once, as it had shrieked off into the woods. That’s when he called me.”   
  
Steven opened the back of the van, threw aside some loose blankets, and grabbed a handle on the floor of the van. It clicked, and then he slid open a concealed drawer.   
  
“My brother told me what had happened. He locked down that cabin as good as he could, but he could see the creature, out in the tree line, moving around the cabin. He said it looked almost like it was gliding. I jumped in the truck and said I’d come get him, to sit tight. He was a couple hours away in that weather. When I finally got there, the cabin was dark. The door was smashed off its hinges, and there was black mud everywhere. When I entered, I smelt it first. An earthy, wet-dog like smell permeated through the cabin. Then I seen it. The thing you saw tonight. Tearing my brother open, feasting on his insides. I opened fire on it, hit it multiple times. It ran, crashing through the back window and into the woods, screeching. My brother was dead, and the thing that killed him was alive. But I hurt it. Bad I think. And I am sure it can be killed. Because..”    
  
He gestured to the drawer he had opened as he flicked a switch, turning on rows of little LED lights. In the drawer, under some sort of glass top, was a large assortment of weapons – handguns, automatics, shotguns – as well as grenades, blocks of what looked like could be c4, and two sets of night vision goggles. But what was in the middle compartment was the thing that made my jaw drop.   
  
In the middle compartment, in an air-tight glass container, pulsating under the lights, was a large, black, clawed hand. Its pitch-black skin shined under the LED lights, pulsating and writhing in its container.    
  
“My brother managed to take its hand off in his struggle with it. If it can lose its hand, it can lose its head” he said, lifting the glass top that covered the weapons.   
  
“It's moving”, was all I managed to say, mouth wide in disbelief.   
  
“I don’t understand it, but the closer it is to that thing, the more it moves. It’s like it's still connected. That’s how I track it.”   
  
He reached in and pulled out the two sets of night vision goggles, handing one to me and placing the other on his own head, all while I stared at the shiny black hand as it wriggled about in its container. It was about twice the size of a human hand, with what looked like four long fingers and two thumbs that ended in sharp claws.    
  
He grabbed a vest that was hanging on the side of the van and slipped into it, clipping it around his waste. He placed three grenades in the pouches on the side, then some ammo clips in the front pockets, before adding some individual shotgun shells in the designated loops. He handed me a much simpler-looking vest – no pockets, just clean black.   
  
“Here, put this on. It might help.”   
  
I threw it on, tightening the sides before slipping the night vision goggles over my head.   
  
   
  
Suddenly a guttural shriek tore through the storm, snapping our attention away and sending my pulse racing.   
  
   
  
"We don't have much time," he said, closing the lid and sliding the drawer back into the base of the van. He grabbed his weapons and closed the doors to the van. We heard a commotion, maybe a few properties down from the gas station as we rushed back into the storeroom, closing the metal door behind us and locking it.   
  
We made our way back to the main shop front of the gas station, staying in the shadows of the shelves as we looked through the front windows. Steven pulled his night vision goggles down over his eyes, so I copied him, as he reached out and flicked off the last of the lights, casting the store into full darkness.    
  
Through the green-tinted dual binocular units, we looked out into the street in the direction of the Police Station. Aside from the trees blowing around as the rain hammered down, the street was void of movement. The street was a predominantly residential street, the only other store on this block was a hardware store which wouldn’t open for another few hours.    
  
Steven whispered to me “It’s coming. It knows you are here”.   
  
We crept forward towards the windows, guns raised, eyes scanning the streets and yards of the houses beyond the gas stations forecourt. Suddenly there was a sound of glass smashing as a car rocked about five properties down the street, setting the cars alarm off. The lights of the house in front of it turned on, and moments later the porch lights flicked on.   
  
“No, don’t”, I whispered, as I watched the front door of the house open.   
  
A dark shape moved from behind the car and over the front fence as we heard a man scream. We watched him try to slam the door unsuccessfully, as the black creature stormed through the door.   
  
“It’s going to kill everyone in town”, I said in disbelief.   
  
“No, it's not” Steven replied, moving to the front door and unlocking it.   
  
"We’re going to stop it”.   
  
I followed him out onto the forecourt and under the cover of the forecourts' large roof. Screams continued echoing out from the house and down the street, this time a females, as something smashed through one of the windows on the second floor. It had looked like the body of a child.   
  
“We need to draw its attention. I have an idea.” Steven said as he moved back towards the door. “Lift your goggles and wait here” he said, as he entered the shop.    
  
“Lift my goggles?”, I mumbled, not sure I had heard him correctly. Suddenly the lights in the forecourt burst on, temporarily blinding me as I yanked the goggles up, immediately rubbing my eyes.   
  
“Damn it man”, I said, rubbing my eyes as some country western song started blaring out the speakers in the forecourt. I looked through the windows into the shop front as Steven turned the volume up, the cheap speakers distorting and crackling.    
  
But it did the trick. The creature jumped out the smashed window on the second floor of the house, landing out of view behind the fence. Inside the gas station, Steven again flicked off all the lights and lowered the volume, still truly audible but no longer blaring. I lowered the goggles again and lifted my gun.   
  
With the creature’s attention diverted, Steven banged on the window and motioned for me to stay put. The rain poured down, obscuring our view, but the creature's unnerving shrieks and the occasional glimpses of movement between parked vehicles and behind large trees let us know it was coming.   
  
Sweating, I started to panic when I realised Steven hadn’t rejoined me, leaving me standing in the forecourt by myself. Keeping my eyes firmly on the street in front of me, I slowly started backing up towards the door. Before long, my back heel banged into the door, and I reached one hand behind me, shaking the steel handle. It was locked. The fucking bastard left me out there. Alone. He was using me as bait.   
  
I turned to bang on the door behind me, when, almost as if out of nowhere, the creature appeared on the edge of the forecourt, at the point where the wall of rain was cut off from the large roof structure. Glistening as the rain rolled down its pitch-black, I could now see it was segmented and solid looking, like an exoskeleton. It stood there on four limbs, arching back, additional limbs like arms in front of it, with its large, clawed hands opening and closing. I thought for a moment that may it needed to stay in the rain, that’s as far as it would come and I would be safe, when it fired a tendril out of its side, hitting a pump, and another hitting the ground, and it slowly started moving towards me. I raised the shotgun towards the creature, it made a guttural growl and lowered itself closer to the ground, now only a dozen feet away from me. I aimed, finger shaking on the trigger, when it all happened at once.   
  
The creature launched itself at me, the glass of the gas stations window shattered, and a hail of bullets ripped into the creature as Steven opened fire from inside the station. The sudden noise made me jump and clench my hand, pulling the trigger on the shotgun, hitting the creature mid-flight and sending it crashing backward. Steven jumped through the shattered window, expertly ejecting the spent mag and loaded a new one, and walked towards the creature as it screeched in agony, firing tendrils behind it to try and pull itself back out into the rain.    
  
“Oh no you don’t you fucker” he said, firing more shots into the creature as he closed the distance between them. He then whirled the assault rifle around to his back and pulled out the magnum, firing more shots at close range as pieces of the creature broke of and splattered across the forecourt.   
  
Click click click. He finally emptied the magnum, now standing directly over the creature. “Thats for Alex”, he said, finally re-holstering the empty gun.   
  
“Is it dead”, I finally muttered, still holding the shotgun in place.   
  
“If it ain’t yet it will be when I take its head off”, he replied, pulling a large knife out and leaning down to the creatures mangled body.   
  
The knife touched the creatures throat when at the same time a final tendril shot out, going right through Stevens throat and into the gas stations roof.   
  
Through bloody coughs, Steven dropped the knife and reached one hand into his pockets. The creature squirmed a little on the ground, some dismembered limbs flipping over on the spot they had been torn off.   
  
Steven pulled his hand out of his pockets and weakly threw something in my direction. A jangle of metal hitting concrete sounded out as his keys landed at my feet.   
  
“Go”, he said meekly, coughing up blood.   
  
“But”, I began, before he repeated “Go” with more venom as he reached to his vest this time and popped open two of the pouches holding the grenades. I could see what he planned, and I got the feeling he wouldn’t wait for me to go to pull the pins on those grenades.   
  
I took off, saved by someone willing to sacrifice themselves for the second time tonight. Running around the side of the building to the van parked out back, I threw open the door, tossed the shotgun to the passenger seat and jumped in the van. It started straight away, much to my relief, and I began reversing out of the parking space when a loud explosion cut through the night. I slammed the van in drive and floored it out onto the street, accelerating down the road, when a second, much more powerful explosion literally lifted the vans back wheels from the ground, almost flipping it in the process. The sky in the rear-view mirrors lit up a bright orange as the shock wave flattened nearby trees, the gas tanks exploding in the aftermath of the grenades going off. Another explosion ripped through the night as I drove out of that town, leaving whatever was left of that creature to barbeque in that flaming gas station.   
  
I drove for hours, well into the afternoon of the following day. I only stopped when I was sure if I didn’t I would crash the van from complete exhaustion. Once rested I drove again, across the country, as far from the town as I could. I have been living out of the van ever since, doing odd jobs here and there to get by. I saw on the news they had said an explosion at the gas station had killed the attendant and local police officers that had attended the scene, as well as a family of four that lived nearby. They were covering it up, though I wasn’t sure why.    
  
Initially, I thought this creature must have been an alien of some kind. I mean, there is nothing like it on the planet I have ever heard about or seen. But lately, I am wondering if it is something else. Something that the Government may have a hand in. Something, like a weapon. Because I have since heard reports on Reddit and other “underground” news sources of similar creatures appearing in countries we are currently at war with or are wanting resources from. And just yesterday, an army convoy came through the town I am staying in, guarding some extremely modified trucks, heading out to the dessert. And as they passed by, the hand in my van started moving [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/OneMoreNightmare/).
