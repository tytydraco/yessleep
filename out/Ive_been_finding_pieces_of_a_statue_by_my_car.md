I’m not the best driver. I can admit it, at least. I know plenty of folks who are just as bad as I am, and most of them will swear up and down that they’re above average. It’s always someone else’s fault that there are dings in their bumpers and scrapes along the sides of their car. There’s always a story why they weren’t at fault.

I, on the other hand, long ago learned to just take responsibility for my mistakes, and work to avoid them. I park far away from people. I leave extra room in traffic. And if I hear or feel the car hit a curb or whatever, I get out and find out how it looks. I don’t assume it’s all fine and drive off. I’ve lost hubcaps that way, and worse.

A month or so ago, I was making a right out of a parking lot when I ran over the curb. I hadn’t seen it, hadn’t realized I was that close until I suddenly felt the car lurch up and back down on the passenger’s side. I sighed, pulled back around into the nearest space, and got out to inspect the damage.

The car was fine. There were some light scuffs on the side of the tire, but no real damage. No suspicious bulges, no punctures. Nothing that would require fixing.

It looked like I’d taken a big chunk out of the curb, though. Or so I thought at first. There was a broken hunk of rock the size of both of my fists sitting in the gutter, but I couldn’t see where on the curb it had come from. As I walked closer, I realized that it wasn’t even the same material. The curb was cement, but the rock appeared to be something more natural, maybe granite. It was weirdly smoothed along the outside, too, like it had been shaped. It clearly hadn’t come from the curb.

I picked it up to examine it. It was definitely worked stone. I couldn’t quite tell what it had been. There was part of it that looked sort of like a shoe, and it was possible that the piece I was holding had been a lower leg. It wasn’t good workmanship, if that was the case. The details were rushed and vague. The sculptor clearly hadn’t been paying much attention.

I didn’t want to leave it there for someone else to hit, so I tossed it into the trunk of my car. I figured I’d throw it out the next time I was near a dumpster.

I immediately forgot about it, of course. It wasn’t until about a week later I remembered. I jammed on the brakes to stop for a stop sign I hadn’t noticed, and I heard the chunk of rock tumbling around in the trunk. Almost gave me a heart attack because I didn’t realize what it was at first, and I thought for a second that I’d hit something I hadn’t seen. I was checking all of my mirrors in panic and I would have gotten out to make sure there was nothing in the road, if the guy behind me hadn’t honked his horn to point out that I was holding everything up.

As I accelerated through the intersection, I heard the broken rock shift again and suddenly understood what I’d heard. I laughed a little shakily and made a note to get that out of my trunk as soon as possible.

There was a dumpster outside the apartment complex where I was going, so I parked in front of it and popped the trunk. I was surprised to see two chunks of rock instead of one. At first I thought it had rolled hard enough to break in half, but as I pulled the pieces out it became even more confusing.

The chunk I had found the other day, the one that looked like a leg, was as intact as it had been when I found it. The second chunk was entirely new. I had no idea how it had gotten into the trunk of my car.

Just like the first piece, it was made of smoothed granite that had been roughly broken apart. No two edges of the chunks fit together, but they seemed pretty clearly to have been from the same piece. Where the first one resembled a hastily sketched leg, this one gave the impression of an arm. The hand was clear, five splayed fingers. The rest blurred together in a vague mass.

Obviously I’d picked up two pieces that day and forgotten about it. It was the only thing that made sense. I hadn’t remembered that it was in my trunk at all until now. It seemed reasonable that I’d also forgotten that there were two pieces.

I might have managed to convince myself of this were it not for the third piece. It wasn’t in my car. It was leaning on the side of the dumpster.

It was bigger than the other two, and significantly less clear as to what it was meant to be. On its own I might not have even understood that it was part of a statue. It was a misshapen granite cylinder, broken on all sides. Anyone glancing at it would have assumed it was discarded construction material.

It was smoothed in places, though, and the same color as the chunks of statue I was holding. I pressed the leg up against it, rotating until I found where the breaks matched up. The arm fit as well.

The discarded piece was three-quarters of a torso, a blurred, half-seen image set into stone. It was built to half-scale, assuming it was meant to be an adult. It was possible that it was a life-sized statue of a child.

I didn’t care. I threw all three pieces into the dumpster and parked as far away from it as I could. When I left my friend’s house that night, I checked my trunk before I drove home. It was empty, thankfully.

By the time another two weeks had passed, the whole thing was starting to seem silly. Yes, it was odd, but so were a lot of things. Strange coincidences occurred all the time. Most of them were never explained. That was just the way of the world. I had other things to worry about.

I was thinking about some of those other things as I reversed out of my parking space at work. It had been a long day at the end of a long week. I was the last one out of the office. The sun had not yet risen when I’d driven in that morning, and it had already set by the time I left. My office had no windows. I hadn’t seen the sun at all that day. I was trying to remember if I’d seen it all week.

I was distracted, is my point. There was no one in the lot. There was no particular reason to pay attention. Until a loud crunch shattered my thoughts and dragged me back to reality.

There was nothing in my mirror. There were no other cars in the lot. I was nowhere near any median. I slammed the car into park and jumped out to see what had happened.

The statue lay broken in the parking lot, the pieces just as I had seen them before. The left leg was under my back wheel. The arm with the splayed fingers was a few feet away. The damaged torso rocked gently back and forth nearby. None of the pieces of the right side were there, but the head….

The head was in a thousand pieces of granite, splayed across the black asphalt in a terrible constellation. It was as impressionistic as the rest of the statue, but I could see a vague triangle of a nose, a chunk that appeared to connect an eye and an ear, and dozens of other recognizable pieces among the gravel.

It was just a statue, just a piece of unliving rock. I could have swept it aside. I could have driven on. Maybe I should have.

Instead I crouched there in the evening chill, picking up pieces of broken granite until my hands were numb. I stacked the large pieces in the trunk and collected all of the smaller ones into a bag. When I was done, the parking lot was swept clean. No piece of the statue remained.

I’ve been reassembling them at home, epoxying the chunks back together. It’s gone surprisingly easily. I know how it should look. I’ve seen it before.

I may not be the best driver. But I take responsibility for my [mistakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/micahwrites/).
