Hey guys, I don’t even know how to start this. I’ve been lurking here for a while, but I never thought I’d have something worth posting. Now, I’m not so sure. Something’s happening to me, and I need someone—anyone—to tell me I’m not losing my mind.

It started three days ago. Just a normal Friday night. I was home alone because my parents were out of town for the weekend, and my sister was staying at a friend’s place. It was just me, a frozen pizza, and some crappy horror movies on Netflix. Around midnight, I started hearing noises upstairs—like footsteps. At first, I thought it was just the house settling or something, but then I heard a door creak open.

I froze. My heart was pounding so hard I could feel it in my ears. I grabbed the nearest thing I could use as a weapon (a broomstick, because why not?), and slowly made my way upstairs. Every light was off, but the hallway felt… wrong. Like the air was heavier somehow. I checked every room—my parents’ bedroom, my sister’s room, even the bathroom—but nothing was out of place.

When I got to my room, though, the door was wide open. I know I closed it earlier. My bed looked like someone had been sitting on it—the blanket was wrinkled in this perfect outline of a body—but no one was there. That’s when I noticed something on my desk: a piece of paper folded neatly in half.

It wasn’t mine.

I unfolded it with shaking hands and saw just two words scrawled in messy handwriting:

“Don’t look.”

I noped out of there so fast and spent the rest of the night downstairs with every light on. Nothing else happened that night, but the next morning, things got weirder.

When I woke up (on the couch), my phone had 17 missed calls—all from my number. At first, I thought it was some kind of glitch or prank, but when I listened to the voicemails… they were just static. Except for the last one.

On that one, there was breathing. My breathing.

I don’t know how to explain it, but you know what you sound like when you’re out of breath? It was exactly like that—raspy and panicked—but it wasn’t me who left it. It couldn’t have been.

The rest of the day felt off too. People were acting strange around me—avoiding eye contact or crossing the street when they saw me coming. Even my best friend Jake barely said two words to me when we ran into each other at the gas station. He just stared at me like he’d seen a ghost and muttered something about being late before bolting out the door.

That night, it got worse.

I woke up at 3:33 AM (of course) to the sound of someone whispering my name. It sounded like it was coming from inside my closet. Every instinct told me not to open it—but then I remembered the note: “Don’t look.”

So naturally, like an idiot in every horror story ever, I did look.

There was nothing in there except for my clothes and shoes… at first. But as I turned to close the door, something caught my eye—a shadow that didn’t belong to anything in the room. It moved when I moved… but not quite right. Like it was lagging behind me by half a second.

And then it smiled.

I slammed the closet door shut and didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning (yesterday), things escalated even more. My reflection in the bathroom mirror wasn’t syncing up with me anymore—it blinked when I didn’t, smiled when my face stayed neutral. At one point, it mouthed something that looked like “Help me,” but its voice came from behind me instead of inside the mirror.

I ran out of the house after that and drove around aimlessly for hours until Jake called me out of nowhere. He sounded frantic and kept saying we needed to talk in person right away. When we met up at this diner we used to hang out at after school, he looked pale—like he hadn’t slept in days.

“You’re not you,” he said as soon as I sat down.

“What are you talking about?” I asked him.

“You’ve been texting me all week,” he said. “But… you’re \*here\*. How can you be here if you’ve been texting me from somewhere else?”

I pulled out my phone to show him my messages—and that’s when I saw them: dozens of texts sent from my phone to Jake over the past three days that \*I didn’t send.\*

Most of them were just random gibberish or single words like “Soon” or “Watch.” But one message stood out—it had been sent only an hour before we met up:

“Don’t trust him.”

Jake swore up and down he hadn’t sent anything back, but when he showed me his phone… there were replies from him that he didn’t remember typing:

“Who are you?”

“What do you want?”

“Leave us alone.”

We both agreed something seriously messed up was going on and decided to crash at his place for safety in numbers. But now… now I’m not so sure that was a good idea.

Because right now? Jake is asleep on the couch across from me—but his phone just lit up with a new text message.

From my number.

And all it says is: “Look behind you.”

Jake isn’t breathing anymore. And his eyes—they’re wide open and staring at ME like he saw something horrible before he died.

But here’s the thing: There’s no one else here except for us—and his phone just buzzed again with another message from \*me.\*

It says: “You’re next.”

But... I'm holding MY phone right now—and it's dead.

I'm not sure what to do.. I'm still inside Jake's house, next to his corpse. If I go out, I will face the horrors of being imprisoned with charges of murder .. with whatever did this to Jake out to get me, I can't fight back something I cannot see either.

Please. Help.
