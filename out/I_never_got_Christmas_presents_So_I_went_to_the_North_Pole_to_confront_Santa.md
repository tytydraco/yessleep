When I was twelve, I didn’t get anything for Christmas.

I’d hung a sock by the fireplace like every other kid, heart pounding with hope. I’d been good that year. Hell, I even saved an ant from drowning that afternoon, thinking it might count for something. I went to bed with a whole list burning in my head, certain Santa would finally show up.

Next morning I shot out of bed earlier than ever and sprinted to the living room.

The sock was still empty. Exactly how I’d left it.

My mom shrugged and said maybe Santa got lost. I didn’t cry or throw a tantrum. I just promised myself I’d be extra good next year.

I cleaned my room obsessively. Helped my little sister with her homework like a saint. Didn’t bully a single kid for months. That Christmas I left out imported Swiss milk and the most expensive cookies I could find.

Nothing.

By fourteen I started taking it personally. By fifteen I was furious. While other kids bragged about new bikes and game consoles, I stood under an empty tree with one thought looping in my head: Santa is a fucking fraud.

That Christmas night I wrote my own list. Much shorter than his. A lot more personal.

It only had one name:

1. The Fat Red Bastard.

I stopped pretending after that.

While everyone else strung up lights and sang carols, I did push-ups in a blue Christmas hat. I didn’t put up a tree. I planted a bamboo pole in the living room and called it “Santa’s wife’s stripping pole.” I knitted a holiday sweater that read “FUCK CHRISTMAS.” Friends stopped inviting me to their parties once I started trying to recruit them into my Anti-Christmas Squad. I didn’t care. Why would they join? They actually got presents every year.

At seventeen I’d had enough.

I booked a flight to the North Pole using money I’d stolen from Christmas donation jars. Three years followed: raw fish, the same ratty tent, the same frozen clothes, the same curse looping in my head.

Then I found it. Abandoned factories, a dead wreath hanging from a rusted fence, one light still flickering in Toy Assembly Line B. I walked those halls like a detective investigating a crime scene where the crime was emotional neglect and the perpetrator wore red velvet.

That’s when I spotted the stack of redirected mail and overdue electricity bills. All forwarded to Las Vegas.

That fat bastard.

While I froze my ass off eating like a raccoon, he was sipping cocktails and sleeping with hookers in air-conditioned suites.

The trail was easy to follow after that. Bills, old forwarding addresses, cargo manifests. Everything pointed south.

Turns out Santa had gone off-grid five years earlier. He liquidated the reindeer stables, sold the sleigh technology to Amazon for their drone patents, and shut down the toy division after the elves unionized and tried to storm HR with glitter grenades.

The man hadn’t vanished. He’d retired.

I chased leads through duty-free slips, sketchy motel registries, and one very drunk elf in Bangkok who swore he’d seen “the boss” dancing at a strip club called Tinsel Tits.

Finally, a tip from a disgruntled reindeer wrangler: “Sierra Casino, Las Vegas. Room 611. Never leaves. Just drinks and watches reruns.”

I stared at that address for a long time.

Three years in the Arctic Circle for this.

I caught a red-eye flight wearing nothing but my coat and a Christmas hat soaked in spite. I walked through the neon haze of the Strip and took the elevator to the sixth floor.

Room 611 reeked of cigar smoke and cheap peppermint air freshener. Santa sat in an armchair, eyes fixed on a muted Wheel of Fortune. He looked up like he’d been expecting me. He wasn’t fat anymore. Just an old man with sunken eyes and a limp Santa hat that had lost all its fluff.

“You found me,” he said. “Took you long enough.”

“You owe me, you old fuck,” I snapped.

He let out a dry, hollow laugh. “Ah, nostalgia.” He took a slow drag from his Montecristo cigar. “Sit down. We’ve got a lot to talk about.”

He wasn’t the original Santa. He’d been a kid who never got anything either. One day some old Indian guy found him, handed him a sleigh key, and said, “You’re Santa now.” He’d been stuck with the job ever since. Running factories quietly relocated to China, delivering gifts to children, keeping the Christmas spirit alive like some overzealous pastor.

“What happens now?” I asked.

He leaned forward and slid a dusty folder across the table. “Your turn.”

Inside were the deeds to the factories, workshop blueprints, sleigh schematics, and a business card that read: CEO – Claus Inc.

For a moment I was twelve again. Lying in bed, heart pounding, dreaming of a gift that never came.

Maybe this was my chance. Maybe I could become the Santa I never had. Make sure no kid ever felt as invisible as I did.

But then I remembered every empty morning. Every forced smile that vanished in January.

That night I picked up the phone and called Disney.

I sold the whole damn thing. Factories, lore, sleigh, even the elf labor rights. Three hundred billion a year. Forever.

I bought a penthouse in Calabasas and a rice cooker that plays jazz when it finishes. I sleep like a baby in Armani sheets surrounded by Egyptian cotton.

Every now and then, between hookers and high-grade weed, I wonder if I did the right thing.

Those poor kids are still waiting. Still writing letters. Still dreaming of some fat man who will never show.

But I had nothing once, and I turned out fine.

Nah. Screw that. I turned out filthy rich.

So hate me if you want. It’s Anti-Christmas now. Forever.

And hey. If you want in, there’s still some Anti-Christmas Squad merch available. Proceeds go straight to my bank account.

Be the Santa you never had.

Or cash out.

That’s what I did.
