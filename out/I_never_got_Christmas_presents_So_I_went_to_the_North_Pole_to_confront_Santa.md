When I was twelve, I didn’t get anything for Christmas. I hung a sock by the fireplace like every other kid, heart pounding with hope. I was a good kid that year. Hell, I even saved an ant from drowning that same afternoon. Thought maybe that counted for something. I went to bed dreaming of presents, certain Santa would finally show up. Had a list of what I wanted burning in my head. Next morning, I shot out of bed earlier than ever and sprinted to the living room. That was my first taste of disappointment.. The sock hung there, untouched. Exactly how I left it. My mom shrugged, said maybe Santa got lost. I accepted it. What choice did I have? No crying. No tantrums. I promised myself to be extra good next year. I cleaned my room obsessively. Helped my little sister with her homework like a saint. Didn’t bully a single kid for three months straight. That Christmas, I left out Swiss imported milk and cookies. fancy shit, the kind that costs extra. 

Nothing.

By fourteen, I started to take it personally. Fifteen? I was angry. I wanted to burn it all down.. While other kids bragged about their bikes and consoles, I stood with an empty tree and the bitter thought: Santa is a fucking fraud. That Christmas night, I wrote my own list. Much shorter than Santa’s. Little more personal. In fact, It only had one name on it.

The Fat Red Bastard.

I stopped pretending after that.

While people strung up lights and sang carols, I did push-ups in a Christmas hat the color of blue.. I didn’t put up a Christmas tree that year. I planted a bamboo pole in the living room and called it “Santa’s wife’s stripping pole.” I made my own holiday sweater that read: “FUCK CHRISTMAS.” Friends stopped inviting me to their parties after I started inviting them into my Anti-Christmas Squad. I didn’t care. I knew I could do this alone. After all, why would they join? They got shit every Christmas.

At seventeen, I’d had enough. I booked a flight to the North Pole with money I stole from Christmas trees. Three years. Living off raw fish. Sleeping in the same ratty tent. Same clothes, same cold, same curse in my head. And then I found it. Nothing but abandoned factories. A dead wreath on a rusted fence. One light still flickering in Toy Assembly Line B. I walked those halls like a detective at a crime scene if the crime was emotional neglect and the perp wore red velvet. Then I saw it: A stack of redirected mail and overdue electricity bills. Forwarded to Las Vegas. That fat bastard. While I froze my ass off eating like a raccoon, he was out there sipping cocktails and sleeping with hookers in AC suites. It didn’t take long to track him after that. The bills, the letters, the old forwarding addresses all of them led south. Way south.

Turns out, Santa had gone off-grid five years ago. Liquidated the reindeer stables. Sold the sleigh tech to Amazon for drone patents. Shut down the mainline toy division after the elves unionized and tried to storm HR with glitter grenades.

The man hadn’t just vanished. He had retired.

I followed the trail through cargo ships, duty-free customs slips, sketchy motel check-ins, and one very drunk elf in Bangkok who swore he saw “the boss” dancing at a strip club called Tinsel Tits.

And then there it was. A tip from a disgruntled reindeer wrangler.

“Sierra Casino, Las Vegas. Room 611. Doesn’t leave. Just drinks and watches reruns.”

I stared at the address for a long time.

This was it.

The journey. The frostbite. Three years in the goddamn Arctic Circle for this.

I got on a red-eye with nothing but my coat and a Christmas hat soaked in spite. Stepped off the plane, walked through the neon haze of the Strip, and took the elevator up six floors.

Room 611 at the Sierra Casino reeked of cigar smoke and cheap peppermint air freshener. Santa sat in an armchair, eyes on a muted Wheel of Fortune. He looked up like he'd been expecting me. He wasn't fat. Just an old man with sunken eyes and a limp Santa hat that had long lost its fluff. "You found me," he said. "Took you long enough." "You owe me, you old fuck," I snapped. He let out a dry, hollow laugh. "Ah, nostalgia." Then he took a drag from his Montecristo. "Sit down. We've got a lot to talk about."

Turns out, he wasn’t the original Santa. He was just a kid who never got anything either. One day, some old Indian guy found him, handed him a sleigh key and said, “You’re Santa now.” He has been doing the gig ever since. Running the factories (translocated to China), delivering them to children. Keeping the Christmas spirit alive like some geeked out Pastor.

“what happens now?” I asked. He leaned forward and handed me a dusty folder. “Your turn.” Inside: The deed to the Factories. . Workshop blueprints. Sleigh schematics. A business card that read: CEO – Claus Inc. For a moment, I was twelve again. Laying in bed, heart pounding, dreaming of a gift that never came. Maybe this was it. Maybe I could be the Santa I never got. Make sure no kid ever felt invisible the way I did.

But then I remembered all those years. All those quiet mornings. All those smiles that vanish when January hits. That night, I picked up the phone and called Disney. Sold the whole damn thing. factory, lore, sleigh, even elf labor rights. $300 billion a year. Forever. Bought a penthouse and a rice cooker that plays jazz. I sleep like a baby in an Armani shirt surrounded by cotton.

Every now and then, between hookers and high-grade weed in Calabasas, I wonder if I did the right thing. Those poor kids. Still waiting. Still writing letters. Still dreaming of some fat man who never shows. But I had nothing and I turned out fine. Nah, screw that. I turned out filthy rich. So hate me if you want. It’s Anti-Christmas now. Forever. And hey if you want in, there’s still some Anti-Christmas Squad merch available. Proceeds go directly to my bank account. Be the Santa you never had. Or cash out. That's what I did.
