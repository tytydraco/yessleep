It was a summer day. Ben and I were fooling around and telling jokes as we walked on the village road.

 As we were walking we saw a beautiful white horse grazing on the grass next to the river. We were so mesmerized by the horse we decided to go and pet it. As we were approaching the horse we tried to figure out to who this horse belonged. We figured someone from the village must have bought the horse. And who wouldn't? The horse was big and strong, his mane a beautiful almost golden color that shined in the light. 

We approached the horse slowly and patted it on the head, the horse was calm and was not bothered by us. Ben wanted to ride the horse and pestered me to help him mount the horse. I helped him to mount the horse. He was so happy. Ben suddenly started to yell that he couldn't move his hands they were glued to the horse's back. The horse began changing his white fur that was falling off showing what resembled fish-like skin. 

The creature started going into the river. I was trying to help Ben to get off the creature but as I was pulling him my left hand touched the creature and my hand glued to its skin. I was now glued to the creature and it was getting closer to the river.

 I pulled out my hunting knife from my pocket. I stabbed the creature in a miserable attempt to try to stop it. But it didn't even react. I was running out of options so I looked at my left hand and started cutting it with my knife. When I started to cut the pain was so bad I almost fainted, blood was splashing into my face and onto the creature. Before I finished the creature jumped into the river.

 With one last slash, I cut off my left hand which was stuck to the creature but at least I was free.
 The creature didn't try to get me or drag me to the bottom of the river. It just looked at me once and then turned its head in the other direction. Ben was still glued on top of the creature. He was looking at me helplessly with fear in his eyes. 

I cowardly turned around and swam to the surface clutching the place where my left hand used to be. I ran to the village center and tried to explain to the villagers what had happened, but I lost consciousness from too much blood loss.

 I woke up a few hours later in the hospital. No one believed me when I told them about how I lost my hand and how Ben disappeared. 10 years have passed since the incident at the river. I returned to my village when I heard the news that a local girl got lost near the river. 

And unlike the others, I know that the creature is responsible. So I'm going back to try to kill it, I tried countless times in the past waiting for days by the river even jumping inside the river to try to lure it but it never came. But this time I know how to get it to come to me. I will avenge my friend.
