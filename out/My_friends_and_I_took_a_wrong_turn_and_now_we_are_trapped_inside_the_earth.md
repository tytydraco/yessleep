I hope this message reaches whoever decides to give it a read. My bars keep cutting in and out, and I'm unsure how long I have left. I am writing under the assumption that my family has already reported me missing: Though I am aware that people could be completely clueless about this situation.

I know this will sound unbelievable, but I need you to give me the benefit of the doubt. Two nights ago, my friends and I were setting out on a two-day trip to the mountains. It was supposed to be Saturday and Sunday, with us returning on Monday, just in time for the last day of school. I screwed up big time, and now we are…lost.

I will take you through the events I remember before diving into what’s happening. Fair warning, things get blood pretty fast.

**Saturday**

“Did you remember to pack everything?” My father asked me as he sat on the couch and put his fork into the microwave meal. He had one of these every Saturday, like clockwork.“Yes. I have everything, including the satellite phone.” I told him as I moved my bags to the front door. We live in Maine; my father has experience camping, hunting, and cave exploring. He always makes sure I'm prepared. I tried to insist that I didn't need half of this stuff for a two-day trip, but he wouldn’t let me go.

Unfortunately, my mom wasn’t home to see me leave. I wish she were because I don’t think I’ll ever see her again.

I said goodbye to my dad and brought my bags outside. Once I got into my jeep, I left to pick up my friends. The first stop was Susian: Like always, she was right on time. Susian was waiting for me on her porch with all her bags already brought out. At that point, I thought we all overpacked.“Hi, Nick!” Susian smiled at me as she jumped into the passenger seat.“I told you I would pick you up first.” I laughed. Susian lived the closest to my house out of all my friends. I also knew she wouldn't be keeping me waiting. After that, we went to pick up Carson; he’s been my friend the longest. We do everything together, and this trip was his idea. He kept Susian and me waiting for about 30 minutes. Finally, we went to pick up Jessie: She was hesitant about coming because she didn’t want to miss the last day of school.

We weren't driving too far but decided to take shifts anyway because we all thought it would be fun. By the time it was Jessie's turn, I felt pretty tired but didn’t say anything. Once we got closer to the forest, I thought I would get my second wind, but I didn’t. I shouldn't have taken my turn, but I did.

Once I got behind the wheel, I felt pretty okay for about ten minutes before feeling sluggish again. I opened the window, hoping it would help me feel better, but the air smelled weird. If anything, It made me nauseous as I drove to the campsite. I periodically made sure to join the conversations my friends were having. About twenty minutes into the drive, I noticed everyone had fallen asleep. Honestly, I have no idea how long they were sleeping.

It was at this point that I made the wrong turn, I think. The drive was almost an hour and a half longer than my father said it would be. My brain felt like a brick was weighing it down. I shut all of the windows and followed a path. A camping site is a camping site, and it shouldn't matter too much.

Once I found a parking space, I nudged Susian to wake her up. I had to nudge her a couple of times before she bothered to answer me. Jessie and Carson reacted similarly; they were all sleeping so heavily.“I feel like I can’t walk,” Jessie mumbled. She looked like she had taken a sleeping pill or something. She was having a hard time keeping her eyes open.“We can rest in the car before going to the camping spot,” I suggested to the group. Carson had already fallen asleep again, and Susian was on her way out: She responded to me by giving me a gentle nod. I thought it would fall asleep, too, and I didn't want to be driving when that happened, so I closed my eyes to take a nap.“Get out of your car!” A voice screamed in my head. I couldn’t tell if it was a dream or not. It wasn’t until I could hear Susian crying that I forced my eyes open. I was so confused and disoriented. I saw a man standing in front of the car with his gun pointed at us.

“What?” Is all I could say.

“Three-!” The man screamed. I remember thinking, what happened to one and two? It felt like I was drunk, but I had nothing to drink. The man's voice sounded like it was sliding through water.

There was a loud bang, and I woke up right away. There was no more head fog. Carson was screaming at me, trying to get me back up the car. As I went back up the car, that’s when I saw her, Susian. Her chest was bloody. She was gurgling at me like she was drawing.“FUCK!” Carson screamed over and over again. He reached into the passenger seat and tried to help Susian. “She’s going to die!” Carson yelled as the man took more shots at my car. 

I got one good look at him before spinning the car around to get away. He wore black sunglasses, a black suit, and a back hat. His vest had the letters U.E.C. on it.

As I drove off, I watched the sun go down. I was trying to get off the trail before losing the light, but one more shot rang out, and I heard my back tire pop. 

“Jessie!” I snapped. I was hoping she wasn’t shot. I watched Carson remove his bloody hands from Susian.“She’s dead.” 

Carson coughed out. He was crying. “How are we supposed to explain this to people!?” He yelled. I didn’t have it in me to tell him to calm down.

“Is Jessie alive?” I asked.

Carson didn’t answer me.

“Is she ALIVE!” I snapped. I could feel my heart skipping beats. I was sweating and shaking. I wanted to throw up. Something was sliding down the side of my face. I assumed it was Susian’s blood.

“She is alive but asleep.” Carson cried as he shook her. Jessie slept through all of that. She was wide awake on the drive up here and somehow slept through everything that happened.As I forced the car forward, we saw the trees around us shaking rapidly. “It's a damn helicopter!” Carson shouted. We both knew they would follow the damn car, so I drove up a little more before stopping.

“We have to get out of here!” I said as I ripped open the driver-side door and ran to the back of the car. I grabbed my bag and shook Jessie again. This time Carson and I were screaming her name together. Finally, she opened her eyes.

“We have to run,” I told Jessie, handing her the bag she brought. She looked confused, and I wanted to explain what was happening, but I couldn’t. There was no time.

The three of us ran into the woods. Carson told Jessie what happened, and she cried the whole hour we ran. I was losing track of time as it was, but the deeper we went, the worse it got. We ran for a little longer before we had to stop to catch our breath. The helicopter was still looming around the area.

As we sat on the ground, I could only hear the sounds of Jessie and Carson sobbing. I didn’t cry because I knew this was my fault. I should've never taken the wheel. As we sat there thinking, Carson pointed out that the bushes were rustling.

I got up slowly and watched a deer come out of the bushes. Jessie took my wrist. As we studied the creature, I could tell something was wrong. Its fur was matted to hell, and even under the moonlight, I could see how dead its eyes looked. “What the hell?” I asked out loud.

The deer's face slowly ripped open right down the middle. We could see the lines of blood and saliva stuck inside the dears head. Its tongue fell out of its mouth, black as coal. We could hear the flesh pulling apart as the deer’s head ripped open. The inside of its mouth was coated with rows of thin, sharp teeth.

I screamed. I screamed louder than I had ever screamed in my whole life. This was it for me; this was terror. My head was pounding. 

It felt like I was seeing something I wasn’t supposed to see. Reality was giving me a peak behind the curtain, and I couldn’t handle it.

Carson got up to run, and that’s when the flashlight hit us. It was more of those guys, the ones who shot Susian. Carson turned to run and bumped into Jessie and me. When we all hit the ground, I thought we were done for. I blacked out.

**Sunday**

“Nick, get up.” I heard Jessie say to me as I slowly opened my eyes. I was shocked, alive and breathing, but something was wrong. The air was different, and I clearly wasn’t in the woods. I clenched my hands. I was lying on the carpet, feeling it under my nails.

I sat up as fast as I could. Pain shot through my back and down my left leg. The back of my head was throbbing. As I turned my attention to Jessie, I noticed the cuts and bruises on her face and arms. “What happened?” I asked her.

“We fell. Somewhere.” Jessie mumbled as more tears slid down her face.

“Where is Carson?” I asked her as I looked around.

“He got up a while ago. He said he would be back but still hasn’t returned.” Jessie told me. She sat back down and hugged her knees. We had no time to process before we heard something shuffling down the hallway.

“Carson?” Jessie asked.

It wasn’t.

We watched as a hulking figure slowly came into our view. Despite the pain in my leg, I stood up right away and forced Jessie to stand with me.

The figure was wearing a black tuxedo with a red bow tie. He had to be at least 6 feet tall. As he walked forward, we could see the brass knuckles he was wearing. They were caked in blood. I took two steps back.

He was wearing a mask that resembled a brown bear. The eyes behind the mask looked hollow. His eyes had no color; they were just white pinpoints surrounded by darkness.

Jessie screamed, and I turned to run further down the hallway. I made sure to hold her hand the whole time. The walls of the building started to blend. The wallpaper is a milky white with no print on it.

As we ran, we saw a door, and I ripped it open as fast as possible. I dragged Jessie inside and slammed the door shut. As I looked around, I could see a sofa, a lamp, a box tv, and other household items. Jessie and I moved the sofa to block the door we came in. I am currently sitting on it as I write this.

Here is what I know.

Something in the air made us tired. I am sure, but I’m unsure what could’ve done that. I don’t know where Carson is, but I am sure he is alive. I am positive we would’ve all been shot and killed if we stepped out of the car.

I know for a fact we fell through the earth. This is not a fever dream or anything. We have supplies and an emergency phone. If you’re reading this, the U.E.C. is not friendly. If you see one of those guys, run.
