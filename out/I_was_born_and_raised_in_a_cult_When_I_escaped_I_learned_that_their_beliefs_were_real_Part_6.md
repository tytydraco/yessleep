We had breakfast at the rocks. The gruel was an appropriate consistency for Luna; she didn’t have to chew as much, and thus could eat it relatively painlessly. The bread was a bit more troublesome, though, so she offered it to me. I humbly accepted, and although I felt bad for eating her food, it was an even worse crime to leave anything uneaten.   
  
I didn’t want to stare, but it was hard not to. Her face looked surprisingly good, all things considered. Some of the bruises were already fading away, and the wound on her forehead was barely visible. I could almost see her face healing, like it was getting better by the minute, but that didn’t seem possible. Maybe the wounds had looked worse in the faint light of the oil lamp - or maybe it simply hadn’t been as bad as I had thought.   
  
After lunch, Luna told me that she wanted to show me something. We went around the hill containing the elders’ complex of buildings. I followed her up the rocky side of the hill, and we stopped at a large rock, which rested deep in the face of the wall. It was miraculously flat, like someone had carved it out, making it the perfect place to sit. Luna sat down and leaned against the wall, closing her eyes to let the sun cover every inch of her body. I followed suit.   
  
Something about the position of the rock relative to everything else made that spot quieter than anywhere else, and it was just high enough that no one below could see us - or from above, either - unless they were really looking. It was just the two of us, not simply in body but in spirit, and without me even noticing, we began to hold hands. We didn’t talk for a while. The sun was warm, and I could hear Luna’s soft breathing, interjoining with the faint echoes of birdsong emanating from the surrounding forest. I could’ve stayed there for the rest of eternity, and I wanted to tell that to Luna, but I didn’t dare to.   
  
The quiet was shattered by a blaring, metallic voice coming from above us. It jolted me away from my daydreams - of *Luna* \- and made my bones feel cold.  
  
“The ritual will commence in two days. True Love will finally bear its fruits, my brothers, my sisters, *our children*! Please make any and all necessary preparations. May the One True God bless us all!”  
  
“Two days?” I asked Luna, my thoughts immediately scattered. She was staring into nothingness, enveloped in thought. I noticed I had let go of her hand, which now felt empty. When did I let go, or did she?  
  
After a pause, she finally looked at me and said “Yeah, I guess it is.”  
  
When John had talked to me about the ritual earlier, I’d thought it’d maybe be months, even years away. Two days was barely enough time to scrounge up a good plan; I had planned my escape for two years. Why hadn’t Luna told me this? But the answer was obvious: Luna had no idea what the ritual was.   
  
I looked around to see if anyone was within earshot. I nudged myself close to Luna, until our elbows touched. She seemed cold and distant.  
  
“After that, after the ritual I mean, it’s done. It’s not possible to escape anymore,” I said.  
  
“Why not?” she asked, perplexed.   
  
She was still under the veil of the elders’ indoctrination. She saw the cracks, but she didn’t know the full story. I took a deep breath, and proceeded to explain everything about the ritual, what K’aluth was, how I had escaped, Jacob’s red eyes, how the watchers found me, and how everyone in my home had, eventually, died. I’m not sure how long it took me to tell her all this, and I’m sure my rambling was barely coherent, let alone chronological, but I remember my mouth becoming dry midway through. When I said it out loud, it all seemed so crazy that I wouldn’t have put it past her to believe John’s implication of my ramblings. Shit, before the ritual, I wouldn’t have believed it either,  
  
Luna kept quiet. I could sense that she was thinking everything over, and that she was thinking me over as well. I was ready to jump off the rock and emancipate her from my madness. I felt like a disease, and she was slowly getting sick.   
  
“So, the day of the ritual is the best time to do it? Like, the way you did it?”  
  
Immense relief washed over me. I hadn't lost her. She was still on my side.   
  
“Yeah, I think so,” I said.  
  
“I can’t leave without my mother. I can’t let *that* happen to her.” She turned to face me. Her usual tough, monotone expression was completely gone, replaced by wide, frightful eyes. “You need to understand that, Allison.”  
  
I nodded, but I knew that there was a distinct possibility that things wouldn’t go according to plan. Her mom was in the grips of elder John, and I doubted whether she would even want to leave, if given the chance. It was hard enough for me to escape by myself, let alone get three people out.  
  
“Should we tell her now? About leaving?” I asked. I thought she should be the one to decide that.  
  
Luna thought about it, then said “I get it. She’s not… she’s part of all this. So maybe we shouldn’t tell her yet. But when we do it, we take her with us, okay? We’ll force her, if we have to. And she’ll listen to me. She *has* to.”   
  
“Works for me. But first we need a plan.”  
  
“Right.”  
  
“Uhh, I don’t have one. I mean, I did, but then, you know.”  
  
“Yeah…”  
  
We sat silently for a while, then Luna said “I think I might have something.”  
  
“Shoot.”  
  
“Okay. So, you said that during the ritual everyone is at the main field, at the center of the compound, right?”  
  
“Yeah, so?”  
  
She lowered her voice. “Well, there’s one spot we could go through, right near the main gate. There’s a burrow that goes under the fence, and I think it’s just big enough to crawl under. They used to patch it up, but when it rains, it always comes back. Eventually they just stopped, so it's been there for at least a year. Anyway, it’s near the gate, which is always guarded by some of the men, so it’s not like anyone could sneak through. But if all the men are at the field --”  
  
“-- then it’s unguarded, and we could go through.”   
  
Luna smiled.  
  
“You think it could work?” she asked. I got the impression that she thought of me as the expert, which I guess wasn’t an entirely undeserved title.  
  
“It’s probably our best bet,” I said. “But they’re still going to be watching that spot with the *live-feeds*, so we need to be quick. And then there’s of course your dad…”  
  
“I can take care of him.”  
  
“But then they’ll just replace him.”  
  
“Right... But I know that the elders won’t get their hands dirty, and they’ll be busy leading the ritual anyway. I doubt they’ll bring in a watcher to replace him - everyone was so spooked when you were brought in by an outsider, you know. The smartest move is for them to just have one of the other dads come and do it, after he’s done with his own family.”  
  
I thought it over, and while I wasn’t entirely sure if John wouldn’t take the chance to personally scalp her mom, Luna’s idea seemed like the most plausible outcome.   
  
“Okay, so suppose all of this goes to plan,” I said, “what if the watchers are in the surrounding woods, just waiting for me - for us - to escape?”  
  
“I guess we’ll just have to count on them having something better to do.”  
  
“Yeah, like shoot up another sector or --”  
  
My sentence was cut short by a scream coming from afar on our right. We stood up to look, and on the main field, I saw a man being dragged. We quickly made our way back down and headed towards the barren field.  
  
By the time we got there, a crowd had gathered. We slipped between them for a better look.  
  
Three men held down another man, standing over his arms and legs to prevent him from squirming. He was still screaming, but his face was in direct contact with the ground, which made his voice muffled as he puffed rough sand out with each breath. I heard something squeaking in the distance, and saw two more men rolling something big towards us. Once they were close enough, I saw that it was made of strong, dark wood, with three adjacent holes carved on the top, the one in the middle, which was larger than the others.   
  
They unlatched something, and the holes were split in two as they opened up the apparatus. They placed the man’s arms and head onto the crescent slits, then brought the apparatus back into its closed state, trapping him into it. He was slightly bent over, and his arms and head looked detached from the rest of his body as they dangled from the holes. He tried kicking the wooden thing, but it wouldn’t budge. The men stood around, and from the hill descended father John, alongside two other elders who I had never seen before, who sported similar black jackets to the one elder John always wore.  
  
The trapped man screamed for help, but once the men saw the elders approach, one of them hit him in the face. He quieted down, and the edge of his lip began to trickle with blood. It looked like it had been split in two.  
  
Once the elders closed in, the crowd took a few steps back. Luna grabbed my arm, and we followed their movements, trying to blend into the crowd as best we could.  
  
Elder John stood forward and looked at the man, and then turned to face the crowd.  
  
“This man has plotted against us,” he said, with mad power in his voice. He didn’t sound like a frail old man - he sounded like a tyrant.  
  
“True Love forbids wrongdoing against thy own brothers and sisters. This man plotted for the escape of his child, which would therefore bring us all to ruin. I’m sure you can all understand that this is not right. For *one* of us to leave brings *everyone* closer to the dangers of the outside world. This is not what the One True God wills us. It is not the mark of a sane man.”  
  
The crowd kept quiet. I wasn’t sure if it was because they *believed* in what John was saying, or because they were too afraid to stand up and say something. How many of them thought like Luna and I did? It was impossible to say.  
  
“How ungrateful must he be, to scheme for escape?” elder John continued. “After the refuge we have given him, his wife, and his son? The food they eat, the water they drink, and the companionship that we have blessed them with?”  
  
“And what else can we do, but give him a reminder of his dissidence?” he said, his voice now low and directed at the man more than the crowd.  
  
As if on cue, one of the men emerged with a handsaw. John nodded at him, and took a few steps back to rejoin the elders. John’s gaze shifted to me, like he had somehow known I had been in the crowd the whole time. He smiled in the exact same way he had when Fred had pulled Luna out from under the bed. A cold fury ran up my spine. In his presence, I had been tiptoeing the line between fear and rage, and now that line had broken, and I ended up falling to the side of head-splitting anger. The only thing I could think was *I hate you*, the words salient and *real*.   
  
The man with the handsaw approached the man in the apparatus, and began to move the jagged blade across his bare arm. The man erupted in a cacophony of shrieks, but he was trapped, unable to move anything but his feet and legs - the mightily thick wood made sure to keep him in place. He kicked and flailed, his hand clenching in a fist as the saw burrowed deeper with each swipe, but he could do nothing to protect himself. Although surrounded by his group, he was completely alone, and *we watched*.  
  
Both of the men were quickly drenched in blood, and the sound coming from the saw’s movements became quiet - at least until it hit the bone.   
  
The man could barely make a fist anymore, and his face was splattered with blood which streamed down alongside his tears. The bone proved difficult to cut through, and each swipe came in a jagged, violent burst that was like two rocks being scraped together. Luna squeezed my arm so tight it began to hurt, but I didn’t care. It felt better to feel pain; to somehow be a part of the man’s experience, to emphatize through suffering.  
  
The bone soon gave way, and the arm was split in two, held together by nothing but skin, muscle, and tendon. It flailed like a broken branch by its bark. It didn’t take much more to snap the arm off, and it fell down, held midair by the handcuff secured to his other arm. The man twitched from pain, his legs kicking the severed limb thoughtlessly. The ground was red and wet, the sand clumping together by the blood.  
  
Another man came and poured something from a plastic bottle onto the wound, and began to wrap it up in bandages.  
  
We watched the man kick his dangling arm for a short while, until his strength slowly dissipated. He could no longer fight, and what was there to fight for, anyway?   
  
Elder John stood with great posture, his aura filled with an evil hubris. He then turned around, and started back up the hill with the other elders in tow, signaling that the show was over. The crowd started to disperse, and it was me who had to grab Luna this time, dragging her away from the carnage.   
  
In the morning, the man was gone, and there was nothing but crimson dirt left.
