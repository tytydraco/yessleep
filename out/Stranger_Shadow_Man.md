This happened a little while ago at my school. I'd say 5 years ago maybe a little bit more.  
I was wondering if this happened to anyone else, I tried searching everywhere on Google but couldn't find an answer to my question.I thought posting this here could help me find people who maybe experienced the same thing?   
I'm writing this because these days I've been feeling uneasy and I'm always feeling watched from my window, down the street under a spotlight. You'll understand why I said that I feel watched from under a spotlight once you read my  story. By the way, yes, this is real. I'm sadly not in contact with my friend that I experienced this with anymore. (:/)  
I was at school with one of my friends and I had to leave to go back home. She had to stay after school. We both went in the hallway to my locker, no one else was there. Only us two. I was talking to her while packing my things up, she was facing towards me. Behind her was the long continuous hallway and a door with a window. We were still having our discussion about whatever we were talking about and then I looked behind her and saw a strange figure in the window, staring at me. Mostly at me. I froze. My friend asked what was up because I stopped replying to her, then she turned around, she froze as well. A weird tall figure, staring at us both and smiling with a big smile.   
I decided to turn away and look away from the window, my friend followed me along and we looked down to the ground, looked back up and the shadow was gone.  
It was tall, completely black, a void kind of black. Smiling with glowy eyes. It wasn't a reflection, there wasn't anything that could've done such reflection with such huge details of a perfect half-moon smile and it wouldn't make sense if the reflection was there and then gone a second later.   
I decided to rush and pack my things up fast and we ran away from the hallway.   
The next day, I started hearing the voice of children, almost kids, calling my name. My friend also experienced the same thing. I'd hear babies cry very clearly even from inside the school, it's like they were beside me. Their cries would last a few minutes. I couldn't figure out what it was, I tried talking about it to one of my teachers but she said things like "You're imagining things!", "That's foolish" and would laugh about it but I was creeped out, traumatized at this point.  
A few days later, I hung out at my friend's house. the same friend with who I saw the shadow guy. We didn't see it for a few days until she told me she heard weird things coming from her backyards. Unfamiliar sounds, weird footsteps in her backyard that made no sense. Well, the same happened to me except I started having weird dreams of being trapped inside a box, a box of void. There was nothing else here, just darkness. I'd hear faint sounds of kids crying. This one time, I'm not even sure if I was concious or not but I was on my bed but there were walks all around my bed. No matter how much I was knocking on the walls and screaming, no one could hear me. I could hear my mom opening my room's door and calling me from a distance but couldn't see her at all. I don't even know if I was awake or not, I don't remember much about this but all i remember is that my door mysteriously appeared again out of nowhere and the walls all around my bed weren't here anymore, I wasn't trapped anymore.  
A few days passed and I saw the shadow guy again, he was standing under the spotlight in front of my school. I didn't say anything, I was just frozen. Couldn't let a word out, as if it was some sleep paralysis, I can't even describe it. I was staring at it, it was staring back at me. Smiling.   
It disappeared. "What the F was that even about" that's what I asked myseltold myself.  
Then that's when I started getting paranoid, the next day after seeing him again under the spotlight, I asked a few kids around my class if they saw an absurdly tall, void black guy in the windows of the school. They thought I was crazy, literally. I asked this to the people of my class and my class only, remember this information. I had some friends 2 grades below mine I believe and one of them was hanging out with me during lunch, I was at a sports club during this time. I asked her the same question I asked others of my class, she said "No but I do know a friend that saw something similar." I immediately asked her to take me to her friend, so we went. Her friend told me the exact description of the guy I saw. "Tall, dark like a shadow and had a smile." the friend said, but, funny thing is that I DID NOT mention this guy was smiling so her friend was absolutely telling the truth, I did not describe to anyone of the class that the guy had a huge smile either. It creeped me out because I knew I and my friend weren't the only ones who experienced seeing this guy.   
I still wonder why I heard kids, babies, well, literal children crying, talking, calling my name as if they were right beside my ear. It sounded so clear too. I'd even hear the voices of my classmates call me but they weren't there. Did my dreams have anything to do with this shadow guy?  
Now, why was he here? Did something happen at this school? Why did he smile???  
I need to see if anyone else has had similar experiences, I need to know what it could be and why it happened.  
P.S; Sorry for my English as it isn't my first language! If you have any questions or something didn't make sense, ask ahead, tell me.
