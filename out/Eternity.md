The clock read 08:00 as my phone buzzed violently on the bedside table. My morning alarm. I groaned, reaching over to silence it. But something felt off. The air was too quiet—no birds chirping, no muffled sounds from the neighbors. It was the kind of silence that pressed against your chest and made you feel like something was wrong. I shook off the unease and got up. The same routine: shower, coffee, and staring blankly at my laptop as I pretended to work. But today, the feeling lingered.

When I glanced at my calendar, my blood ran cold. It was marked as Monday, December 27th. My brain protested. That couldn’t be right. Yesterday had been Monday, too.

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe I hadn’t updated the calendar. Maybe I just forgot. I shrugged it off and went outside.

The world looked normal at first glance, but cracks appeared when I started paying attention. The same elderly woman was walking her dog down the street, her coat a shade of deep maroon. I had seen her yesterday. Not someone like her. Her. The same tired shuffle, the same little white dog sniffing the same patch of grass.

The barista at the café greeted me with her usual cheerfulness, but it was the exact same cheerfulness as yesterday.
“Morning, Nils! Your usual?”
Her words felt like a recording played on repeat.

By mid-afternoon, the paranoia had taken root. Everything was too familiar. I walked the streets for hours, trying to find something—anything—that didn’t fit. But the more I looked, the more I noticed the patterns. The people weren’t living; they were performing.

When I went to bed that night, I told myself I was overreacting. I’d feel better tomorrow. But when the clock hit 08:00 the next morning, and the same alarm buzzed on the bedside table, I knew something was horribly, irreparably wrong.

Days turned into weeks. Weeks into months. Every morning, the same alarm. Every night, the same sinking feeling. No matter what I did, the loop reset. I screamed into the void. I smashed windows. I begged strangers to tell me what was happening. But they only stared at me with lifeless smiles and empty eyes.

I started to notice the cameras. At first, they were subtle—security cameras perched on street corners, or a glint of light reflecting off what seemed like an ordinary lamppost. But then I saw them everywhere. Hidden in the cracks of walls, disguised as birds in trees, even embedded in the faces of people passing by.

They were watching me.

I stopped going outside. I couldn’t bear the thought of their eyes on me, the relentless surveillance. But staying inside wasn’t much better. My apartment became a prison, its walls closing in on me.

One night, I tore apart my living room, searching for hidden cameras. Beneath the wallpaper, I found wires—thin, delicate threads running in every direction. I followed them to a panel behind the bookshelf, where a red light blinked ominously.

“What do you want?” I screamed at the empty room.

No answer came.

I decided to test the limits of the loop. I did the unthinkable: I jumped off the roof of my building.

But instead of darkness, I woke up in my bed. 08:00. The same alarm. The same buzzing phone.

It was impossible to tell how much time had passed. Days? Years? Decades? My reflection in the mirror didn’t change. My body didn’t age. But my mind did.

I started talking to them—the watchers. I’d sit in front of the cameras and pour out my thoughts, my fears, my rage. “Why me?” I’d ask. “What do you want from me?”

One day, they responded.

It wasn’t a voice, but a message, typed out on my laptop screen.
“We chose you because you are interesting.”

The simplicity of it shattered me. Interesting. That was all I was to them. A puppet in their experiment, a toy to keep them entertained.

The messages became more frequent after that. They started directing my actions. “Go to the café.” “Speak to the man in the blue jacket.” “Climb the tower.”

At first, I obeyed. What choice did I have? But their instructions grew darker. “Hurt her.” “Burn it down.”

I resisted. I fought against their control. But every time I disobeyed, they punished me. The world became more unstable. Buildings crumbled, people froze mid-step, the sky turned black. The loop reset, but it became more fractured each time.

One day, I woke up to silence. No buzzing phone. No alarm. The air felt heavy, suffocating. When I stepped outside, the streets were empty. The people, the cars, even the cameras—gone.

I wandered through the desolate city, calling out for anyone, anything. But all I heard was my own voice echoing back.

Then I saw it: a massive screen in the middle of the square, its surface glitching with static. As I approached, it flickered to life.

My own face stared back at me, gaunt and hollow. Words scrolled across the screen:

“You are free now. But you are alone.”

A chilling laugh echoed through the empty streets.

I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The screen went black, leaving me in a world that was no longer looping—but was now a void.
