I think something is haunting me. What do you guys think

I think I’m being haunted by something. Let me know what you guys think. 

So to start things off I’m a Christian who’s always been a believer. My parents both grew up in households where activity was quite frequent. More in my dad’s house than my mom’s but both had decent activity. My dad’s family is very scared of this ghost that they have the house blessed every year now in hopes to ward anything away. 

Recently I bought an ouija board to play with but I got yelled at and was told to return before I even opened it. It’s currently sitting in my garage unopened. It all started after I was on an angry rant saying how ghosts aren’t real and my dad’s ghost and my mom’s ghost never was real and all a lie. I kept going on saying ghosts aren’t real. My parents just kept telling me how they are very real and I shouldn’t be saying those things. 

Three days ago I’m in my basement by myself and something falls off the shelf. It could be explained by the music playing on the Alexa but there was no vibration. It landed decently far like it was thrown from the shelf. The next thing happened yesterday when me and my girlfriend were hanging out at her dads. First thing that happened was the garage door swung open all the way open when it was latched. I got up and closed it and said it was probably a draft to calm her down a little bit. Then not even 2 minutes later we hear what sounds like running around in the garage and something fell. At the point I didn’t check it out because I was startled. We ignored it and continued playing Xbox. Then 5 minutes later we heard the other garage door that lead into the garage completely slam. Again this door was latched 5 minutes ago. We told her dad and he checked everything and no one was there. That was that for the night after that. 

Then today we were taking a nap in the same room and both my arms were infront of her and she was in my chest. She woke up from my dad texting me and she said she closed her eyes and she felt what felt like 3 fingers with long nails poking into her side slowly and didn’t stop. She said she slowly turned and looked and felt the “fingers” pull away very quickly. She was very startled and was freaking out. All of this has happened in the last week and I would just like to know what other people’s thoughts are. Also previously we were sitting in her basement and I was looking into her eyes and in the back behind her I am positive I saw a white flash scream across the back on the basement and I was put into a shock. What do you guys think is going on??? We would appreciate anything.
