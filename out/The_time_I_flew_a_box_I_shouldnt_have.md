The cold, dry wind whistled against the fuselage of my Cessna 185. I brushed my hand along the line of rivets, a nervous habit, making sure none were loose. I glanced at my watch. “He’s late,” I murmured to myself. I finished my pre-flight, screwing the fuel caps on tight, when I heard the sound of dirt and rocks flinging from tires. I hopped down from the wing and saw it: a silver F-150 hauling ass across the ramp.

A man about six feet tall with greasy hair and a black leather jacket stepped out. He looked twitchy, his eyes scanning the empty airfield.

“You said 7:30, it’s now 8:30,” I said, crossing my arms.

“This thing isn’t light, you know,” he shot back, his voice strained. “Took me thirty minutes just to get it in the bed.” He gestured behind him.

In the truck bed sat the cargo. It was a crate, maybe four feet long, made of a dark, oily-looking wood and bound with thick, pitted iron straps. It looked like it had been pulled from the bottom of a lake.

“What is it?” I asked, walking closer.

“Don’t know. Don’t care,” he said, pulling a thick envelope from his jacket. “This is for you. The rest when you land at Miller Field.”

The weight of whatever the box is was astounding. It took both of us grunting and sweating to slide it into the back of the Cessna. It wasn’t just heavy; it was a dead, dense weight that seemed to suck the energy out of you. When I slammed the cargo door shut, the whole plane seemed to groan.

The take-off was sluggish. I had to keep the nose higher than usual, the controls feeling mushy and unresponsive. *My baby* was complaining about the load. As I climbed out of the valley, the last rays of sunlight painted the jagged peaks in strokes of orange and blood-red. Below me, the world was a sea of dark pine and shadowed rock, unbroken by a single light. No roads, no houses, nothing. Out here, all the towers were dark. No flight plan, no radios. Just you and the sky. It’s a freedom I used to crave.

I leveled off at ten thousand feet, the engine settling into its familiar, comforting drone after putting it into cruise. The air was smooth. I checked my gauges—all in the green. I leaned back, letting the autopilot do its job, and watched the first stars begin to prick the deep violet sky. It was peaceful. For a moment, I almost forgot about the strange cargo sitting just a few feet behind my head.

That’s when my left wing dipped.

It wasn't turbulence. It was a slow, heavy roll, like the plane had suddenly gained a thousand pounds on one side. I grabbed the yoke, my knuckles white, and fought it back to level. The autopilot whined fighting me before I clicked it off. My heart hammered against my ribs. I scanned the instruments. Airspeed, altitude, engine temp all normal.

Then I saw the attitude indicator. My artificial horizon, the instrument I trusted with my life, was tilted at a sickening 40-degree angle. It showed the plane in a steep, unrecoverable bank, but the real horizon outside my window was perfectly straight. My inner ear screamed that we were level, but the instrument was lying.

I tapped the glass. The little blue-and-brown ball didn't budge. As I stared, my magnetic compass, floating serenely in its housing, began to drift. It swung past North, then West, and kept going, slowly, deliberately, until the big red 'S' was pointing directly ahead. It was pointing forward, through the instrument panel, through the engine block.

No, not forward. It was pointing behind me.

It was pointing at the box.

A cold sweat trickled down my spine. This wasn't an electrical failure. This was wrong. I forced my eyes away from the lying instruments and looked outside. I would fly by sight. Forget the panel. Just fly the plane.

My hand trembled as I reached for the GPS, hoping for some semblance of sanity. The screen flickered to life. A small icon of a plane sat in the center of the map. According to the screen, I was still sitting on the ramp at Kistler's Pass. The flight timer in the corner of the screen read 00:00:01. I had been flying for over an hour, but the GPS claimed I had never left.

Panic, cold and sharp, clawed at my throat. I was flying blind. My instruments were possessed, my GPS was stuck in a time loop, and there was no one to call. The radio was just a box of useless static. The only thing in my plane that seemed to have any sense of direction was pointing at the silent, dark crate in my cargo hold.

I had to get it out. The thought was insane—depressurize the cabin, muscle a cargo door open against a 120-knot wind, and somehow shove a crate of impossible weight out into the night—but it was the only thought that made any sense.

As I contemplated the suicidal maneuver, my eyes drifted to the landscape below. The moon was bright, casting the jagged peaks in sharp, silver relief. I stared at the endless sea of rock and snow, and then I saw it. One of the peaks, a massive fang of granite miles away, seemed to… shift. It wasn't a landslide. It was a slow, deliberate movement, like a great beast turning in its sleep. I blinked, my eyes watering from the strain, and when I looked again, it was just a mountain. Still and silent.

Was it real? Or was the thing in the box not just breaking my instruments, but breaking my mind, too?

The idea of ditching the crate vanished. If it could do that to a mountain, what would it do to me if I got any closer? No. The job was to fly it to Miller Field. So I would fly. I ignored the panel, a graveyard of flickering lies. I flew by the seat of my pants, my eyes fixed on the stars, my knuckles aching from my grip on the yoke.

Hours bled into one another. The engine’s drone seemed to warp, sometimes sounding like a whisper, sometimes a scream. Finally, I saw them. A string of pale blue lights, impossibly faint in the vast darkness. Miller Field. I aimed for it like a man dying of thirst aims for a mirage.

The approach was a nightmare. My altimeter was frozen at 10,000 feet. I judged my descent by the growing size of the pine trees, my airspeed by the pitch of the wind screaming past the cockpit. Every instinct I had was screaming that this was wrong, that I was too fast, too steep. I ignored it all and trusted my eyes. The runway lights rushed up to meet me. I flared, held my breath, and waited for the impact.

The tires kissed the asphalt with a gentle chirp. It was the smoothest landing of my life.

I taxied toward the far end of the field, where a single, unblinking light marked a derelict hangar. An old, black panel van with no windows was parked there, its engine off. As I cut my own engine, a figure stepped out of the van's shadow. It was a woman, tall and severe, dressed in a heavy canvas coat despite the mild night. She wore thick leather gloves.

I stumbled out of the Cessna, my legs shaking. She didn’t say hello. She just looked at me, her gaze analytical, then glanced at my plane.

“The instruments?” she asked. Her voice was flat, devoid of curiosity.

“They’re shot,” I rasped.

She gave a single nod, as if I’d just confirmed the weather. “Payment,” she said, holding out an envelope identical to the first one. She and a man who emerged from the van, equally silent and grim, didn't ask for my help. They used a small, wheeled dolly to expertly slide the crate from my plane and into their van. The process was efficient, practiced.

I stood there, dumbly holding the envelope, as they latched the van doors. The woman paused before getting in the driver's seat.

“Get some rest,” she said, her eyes boring into mine. “The influence fades with distance. You’ll be fine by morning.”

Then she was gone, the van’s taillights disappearing down a service road.

I was alone. The silence of the airfield was absolute. After a long moment, I climbed back into the cockpit, my body aching. I slumped into the pilot’s seat and my eyes fell on the instrument panel.

Everything was perfect. The attitude indicator was perfectly level. The compass pointed north. The GPS showed my plane sitting at the end of the runway at Miller Field, and the flight timer read 02:17:43.

It was all real. I stared out into the empty night, the cash on the seat beside me feeling colder than any wind. I had flown the box. And I knew, with a certainty that chilled me to my soul, that I would never be the same.
