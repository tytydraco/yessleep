i only ahve so long to write this so bear with me, last night i killed my mother with a kitchen knife. I know for absolute certain that that happened, i remember the sensation of the knife in her stomach, i still can hear her knocking over my grandmothers ashes as she went to the living room, i can still feel her grabbing my hair as she cried while i chocked her out on the floor. I can still smell the bleach lingering in my nose from the cleanup. i can still see her severed head which i bled dry and put under my bed.

  
despite all of this everything I've said, my mother was in the kitchen this morning making me breakfast, i didn't even know she could cook let alone stand up on her own before 7 AM, usually she would spend all night with either a needle in her arm or a pipe between her lips. yet here she was making me pancakes humming the song she used to sing to me when i was young. 

  
i cautiously walked out of my room i was certain that i didn't make any noise, I'm confident in my ability to move around unnoticed, and yet she still saw me

"Good morning Jason ^((not my real name))", It had been 11 years since anyone called me by my first name, i didn't even know my mom remembered it. "Youve been working so hard lately i thought i would treat you this morning" i noticed that she wasn't looking me in the eyes as she was speaking. "Especially to celebrate your mommy's newfound sobriety" The words shot a twang of sadness and relief through me. Maybe last night was just a bad dream, maybe my mom was okay, maybe a wouldn't have to pick up her empty beer cans, maybe just maybe i could leave and put my atrocious family behind me without worrying about your mother killing herself.

  
that thought was killed and replaced with raw terror as i saw the open bottle of bleach that i left by the front door, last night i left it there in case i saw a patch of blood i might have missed in the dark of night. in that instant i became terrified of what was standing in front of me.

  
I came up with some excuse i think i said i had a job interview or something and i got in my car and drove away. she said, "Alright dear just be home in time for dinner", and gave me a hug She smelled like old coins and overcooked methamphetamine, and her eyes they were yellow. I haven't been home since. i don't know what to do someone please help me, just tell me what to do, id rather kill myself  then go back and face that "thing" alone or unprepared. If your close by and willing to help me I'm in a library in Hillpoc Delaware, Please Please Please, I don't want to face it alone
