This story goes back many years from now. I was a small boy, only in the fourth grade. My friends and I had become obsessed over the midnight game—an ancient pagan ritual that has since become a game like Bloody Mary that thrill seekers participate in. The midnight game ritual goes like this. Everyone participating in the game must write their full name on a sheet of paper and shed a drop of blood onto said paper, secondly you must ensure every light in your house is turned off and take your signed, blood stained paper to the front door of your house, said door must be made of wood. Each person participating in the game then lights a candle outside the front door, places their candles on top of their paper and knocks on the door 22 times, ensuring that the last knock occurs when the clock strikes midnight. You then blow out your candle, walk back inside and reignite your flame. You have know summoned the midnight man. You must roam the house with no light source other than the small flame provided by your candle, turning the smallest of hallways into a seemingly endless void of unknown darkness until 3:33am. 

So my friends and I decided to orchestrate a sleep over one weekend and gave this ritual a try. And the outcome left me genuinely and utterly petrified, which is why I am writing this story 23 years later. After my friends and I completed the knocking part of the ritual, we darted back into the house after blowing out our candles to relight them, as we were absolutely horrified of the uncertainty. I remember the manner of how we darted inside leaving our signed, blood stained papers in a complete unorganized disaster outside my front door. The front door of my house enters into a hall way that goes straight to the living room and on the right side there is a staircase that wraps around the wall of my kitchen and pantry that is beside my living room. My friends and I immediately sprinted up those stairs, miraculously not putting out any of our candle flames. Once we reached the game room upstairs we set up a fort of couch cushions due to the fear of the uncertainty. 

Now the rules of the game stated that we are meant to roam the house and not remain in one position. But to be straight up, the nine year old kids we were did not summon the courage to do so. That was until about 12:50am I got the idea to go downstairs and get some energy drinks out of the fridge so that we did not go to sleep. However, I was not gonna do it alone, so I convinced one of my three friends to come with me. We slowly start creeping down the wrapping staircase. As we come around the corner of the wall we can see the front door and the front porch through a window. This is the moment I realized we may have made a very poor decision. The papers with our names and blood had somehow been placed in a perfect half-circle around my front door on the porch. We immediately sprinted back up the stairs under pure terror. 

We arrive back to the cushion fort we constructed and tell the others what we saw. They saw the terror in our faces and believed us right away. We sat in our fort for another 30 minutes facing the stairs with all of our candle lights trembling in fear, unable to see the start of the stairwell covered by darkness. This is when things got worse. We started to hear heavy footsteps stomping up the stairs slowly, but when they arrived to what sounded like the top, the sound just stopped. We knew something was standing there, staring at us. That is when my candle light went out. According to the rules of the game I have ten seconds to reignite my flame or I loose, in which the midnight man will induce hallucinations of my worst fear or take my soul. Luckily I was able to ignite my flame in what seemed like less than ten seconds. As I calm down a few seconds later, I realized that the room had become extremely cold. The temperature change was so rapid that it would be impossible to be the air conditioning. 

At this point we have renovated our Cushion fort with blankets covering the top, giving the perception of a sandbag WWII bunker. It was now 2:00am and the fear was still thriving in each and every one of us. We couldn’t help but start to continuously peak outside of our fort. Immediately as I peak outside, I look towards the stairwell. The guest bedroom door that was previously closed was now open, and with a small light source from the street lights outside, I saw it. A tall dark figure outlined in the darkens by the feint shimmer of light. I couldn’t move. I was paralyzed by my fear. I knew that this could not be my parents, as the figure seemed to be around 8 feet tall. Finally my friend pulls me down and whispers “what the hell do you see man?”. I reluctantly told him. His and the rest of my friend’s eyes quickly widened in fright. The friend who pulled me down says “we cannot look back out there”. However, in my head I’m thinking he knows we are here, hiding will do nothing, but my friends are now crying, begging me not to look again. The rest of the game until 3:33am we sat in our fort that was cold to the point that we were all shivering, just waiting and listening as heavy, stomping footsteps sounded from the guest bedroom and up and down the stairs. 

When 3:33am arrived we immediately turned on all the lights upstairs and did not go back down stairs until the sun came up. We never slept until the next night, defeated by deprivation. To this day I still have zero explanation for what happened. It is something that I still cannot fathom. I’ve asked my parents many times when I visit now as an adult if they played any part in my terrifying experience, but they have no answers and laugh off my childish past, unaware of the severity and terror of that night.
