U/LolsMor ┃Jan 13th 2042

Please don’t let the title fool you. I love my family with my entire being. Out of everything I’ve done, created, or so much as devoted a shred of my being to - they stand alone as the greatest parts of myself. Nothing brings me more pride than the fact that I can call them my own. In a world where nothing is promised, and everything is taken, I’ve been so lucky to call them my own. To be given everything. And it all started with him.

I met Theodore when I was 19. I was an assistant book keeper at the library of our alma mater, and he was a pretty face who would come in at 1, leave for his class at 3, and he would always turn his books in by Saturday.  I’d come down with a bad case of strep throat the week he had came to see me.

 My boss told me that he had come to return a book, on Saturday (The day I was supposed to work) asking for the “freckled girl with red hair” and whether I was single or not. My heart spun in circles. I’d waited for my illness to subside before I called him for the first time. It only took a handful-more of those before we had our first date. 

We went to a natural history museum. To the boys reading this, this is not the move for most women, but it worked like a charm on me. It was a secret interest of mine. It only took two more dates before we had come to the mutual understanding that we had feelings for each other. On our 6 month anniversary, he told me that he thought we were soulmates and that whether or not I liked it, he would always be there for me, and endlessly love no one else but me. And he kept his promise in more ways than one. At the time I had a mounting drug problem. My father had passed during my senior year of High School, and it completely blindsided me. It was the first major loss of my life, and led me to a really dark place. 

It started with cough syrup. To dull my senses and prolong my sleep. Then I got my hands on a Prozac prescription. And then the two got to know each other. And, then - oh who’s this? Xanax. A warm, smooth, talking soothsayer. By the time it was really bad, I was away from home so nobody that I really cared about came to notice. Until Theo came along. He noticed immediately, and once he did, he never took his eye off me. He didn’t shame me, he didn’t beg me to stop. He just served me. He held my hair & stroked my back as I threw up gallons of bile. He wiped my tears and brought me water, even when I was being difficult. He urged me (as kindly as he could) to go to therapy with or without him. Being stubborn, I resisted, until one day, the toll of my obstinance was too much and I realized it was easier to humor him. And little by little it had its effect. I checked myself willingly into a rehab program, completing my final semester remotely.




We graduated in 29, Got Engaged in 31, and had the twins in 35. Sierra & Mylo - our sun and moon - both aptly born in May, just in time to be Geminis. As androgynous babies, they really were twins, but little by little grew into their preordained features. Sierra took after Theo. Her world consisted of decades old PBS programs like Wild Krats & Odd Squad. Like her dad she was concerned with the facts and science. Then there was Mylo. His idea of fun was throwing golf balls at our shed door or peeling the paint off of chipping walls. Only when he was 5-ish, that behavior handled itself. He was rash, boy-ish, and high energy. Like me. Theodore matured into the man I knew was lying in wait, when I met him - and all while retaining his best features. He’s handsome. Intellectual. Confident. Stayed committed to both me and his career (Archaeology) 

We were The Moreau Family. And that was all I ever needed. But as of late, something hasn’t been right. It’s been hard to explain and even harder to rationalize, and I am really at my wits’ end.I’m not an internet person whatsoever, but I really feel like I have nobody in my life who I can share this with as of now. For context, I have to go back a little bit.  


It could’ve been 3 weeks, or 3 months ago, I don’t know. My sense of time has been poor recently. But i know what we were doing. We were visiting my mother, upstate. My mother lives in the sticks, far, far removed from the closest podunk settlement they call a town. She likes it that way. She is and always has been an introverted woman so this was entirely her decision. She lives in a two-story, cabin-like house. Aesthetically rustic, but containing all the trappings of modern life. The kids loved visiting her. Mylo loved sledding down the snow covered hill her house rests on while Sierra likes to watch the deer graze at the edge of the forest from my mother’s living room. Meanwhile the adults would talk about whatever, for hours. Theodore loved my mother. They held intelligible conversations and seemed to enjoy each other’s company, which is much more than many can ask for. 

The time had come to leave. The news broadcast droning on in the next room gave way to murmurs of slick roads, and coming snow. “We better get ahead of all that.” Theo said, as he stood up, going to hug my mother. Our exit was delayed with the run of the mill, endless pleasantries. Hugs and courteous kisses. I remember Mylo giving my mom a half assed hug, just so he could begin racing towards the car before his sister could. That really was our cue to leave. It was only a matter of time before they began to fight. Sierra, catching wind of his plan, followed suit. 

I followed the kids down the winding stairs towards the front door, and out into the frigid driveway. Mylo and Sierra began to bicker, and that’s where this part ends. There’s an awkward cut in my memory, jumping to the car. The car. We’re riding down a road that splits a forest in two. We’re all singing. 

“One-two, one-two, one-two, one-two, one two”

“Can't keep runnin' away”

Runnin, The Pharcyde. I didn’t like when Theodore played that song around the kids. Mylo cussed enough already, We didn’t need it rubbing off on Sierra. But I didn’t care. I don’t know why but I didn’t. But I’m getting sidetracked. 

I noticed a car in the opposite lane, lulling across it aimlessly. It would slowly veer one direction then correct into another before veering back into the opposite direction and being forced back to attention. I told him to watch out for the car and he did. ; I know he did, I was watching him, watch it. It got closer with every second, foot by foot, rolling down the road towards us. It was almost past us in-fact, when it suddenly veered into our lane. Theo swerved out of its path, flying off-road and then, black. We collided. 

Even in complete darkness, I could feel blood pooling in my head, and the leather strap boring itself into my chest. Sound came first. I heard creaking. Groaning injured metal. My vision came back to me a moment later. And then I was conscious. Everything was upside down. The windshield cracked in webs, like dozens of lightning bolts. The dark gray center console, was covered in gloopy maroon colored blood and viscera. Everything had been thrown around like we were in a massive washing machine turned over dozens of times. Nothing is where it should’ve been. 

Sierras lens-less glasses had been thrown to the front of the car, crushed beneath my purse, which of course had spilled everywhere. It stunk in there. Like that gross heat scent from hairdryers multiplied, on-top of the smell of copper. Steam poured out of the obliterated front hood, which had been warped around the trunk of a tree.  Another sense was acted upon. A cold snot like feeling running down my face from the top (my mouth) to the bottom (my forehead)

It was blood, spilling from a large open gash on my forehead. I don’t know why, but this is the moment where it clicked for me that something was really wrong. Or at least when the flight took over in me, and the shock had subsided. I snapped my neck to face the backseat to check the state of the children. Sierra hung upside down from her magenta car seat, hair matted and caked with drying blood. I couldn’t even see her face. 

I turned to Mylo, slumped over in his chair, folded unnaturally far, head by his knees. That’s when I saw Theodore. A thick tree branch jutted through the crystalline windshield. I followed the length of the branch, watching in complete horror as it made its way towards, into, and completely out the back of the left side of my husband’s face. The right half was horrifically preserved. Even when horribly warped and smeared in blood, it was still unmistakably him. 

I looked at him for a long time before I could scream. It really felt like there was no point in doing it. Wouldn’t bring him back. 

And that’s the last thing I remembered.

 The next thing chronologically after that is the rubbery smell of a hospital, like latex was being stretched over my face. Then the rhythmic beat. I waited in this black for so long. It felt like an endless loading screen. Just before my eyes shoot open as if they have never been shut up before, suddenly taking in a blinding white room. 

I felt a syrupy weight descend onto me, like it was suddenly activated by a flipped switch. There was pain my neck, arms and legs. A shooting, biting on tinfoil feeling rolled up and down my body. The blinding white had given me the impression of the afterlife. Heaven? Then the orderly’s big, bulbous head entered my field of view. She wore a cherry smile, rosy fully cheeks, and had an impeccably neat demeanor. “Welcome Back Mom” she said in the same inflection a clown speaks with. Out of everything I had just experienced. This was the most jarring. I was just in the car. And more importantly,

“MOM!” 

In the corner of my room, standing in idyllic, excellency, is my family. Sierra and Mylo gaze up upon me ecstatically, Sierra wielding a tuft of balloons & Mylo holding a sign reading in colorful bubble letters:

“WELCOME BACK MOM!!!”

They were not without damage though. Sierra had a new pair of glasses, and faded cuts on her face. Mylo had a cast slung around his arm, while Theo also had several scars. 

Before I could process any of this, the nurse stepped aside, allowing for the children to make a beeline towards me. The kids wrapped me in their all encompassing grasp, Theo followed doing the same, locking in place the group huddle. They all fought each other to express their joy at my return first—

“I missed you so, so, so, so, so much mommy!”

“Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!”

Theodore teared up, moving the kids aside to plant a firm sloppy kiss on my lips right in front of them, grabbing my cheek with a sultry tight hand. He released me to bellow through his teary voice, 

“You’re back! Oh My God. Lola. Oh God-”

It was beautiful. And suffocating. They hadn’t realized it but their combined love was literally crushing my fragile frame. But I tried not to make them feel bad. I thanked them, and gave them my love several times over but they all still held onto me, in silent unity. After a moment I had to speak up, “Okay. Okay - Theo - Honey?” He immediately let go of me. As did the kids. “Sorry - I’m sorry, it’s just been - wow.” He leaned back in and grabbed my face once more. This time I could tolerate it. I’m not being crushed and hey, cuts or not, this man is still mine. 

I don’t remember exactly what she said, but the nurse informed me that it had been weeks since the car accident. A drunk driver, passed out at the wheel, veered into our lane, and Theodore narrowly avoided him by driving off road, but crashing in the process, and that as a final result, I had been in a coma for a few weeks. I knew all of that already though. What didn’t track was everything after.

I swore by everything in heaven and below it, that I saw with my own eyes what I had seen. Sierra, Theodore, Mylo. She explained that comas often produce false memories & experiences that are often just dreams, or at times entire mental fabrications. Mine fell into the latter. I still had my questions though. I’ve always heard that despite being asleep, you were conscious during a coma. Wouldn’t I remember something? They say you could overhear conversations as if you’re lucid, so then why did I not hear literally anything? I didn’t have the vocabulary to fully articulate this at the time (I was still somewhat in a daze) nor did I truly care. My family is here & I’m alive. To complain or turn my nose up, at anything would just be a slap in the face of God. I had already been given my miracle.

I was discharged later that day. No checkups no interviews. I don’t even think I had to sign a form. We drove home in our new car. Theo kept me up-to-date, saying that he had bought it a little while after the crash. Didn’t seem to quite add up considering how long it would take to get a brand new car I thought, but again. Anyone would bury this thought. We arrived back home just as the sun was setting. Dinner time, I thought. Theodore had rightfully informed me, that considering how I was still recovering - and therefore royalty, that he would do me the honor of cooking tonight and every night going forward. I shuddered at the thought. I love this man but he has never been a cook. But I humored him. 

I was lying down in bed for a good 10 minutes, when he came upstairs to tell me that dinner was served. On the plates before me, was a perfectly smoked ham, beside a bed of glossy, buttery mashed potatoes, and a heap of sautéed green beans with slivers of toasted almonds. Before I could process any of this, Theo was already planting a million kisses on my cheek. He said that I deserve something extra special for overcoming such an extra special circumstance. I was touched. I dug in immediately, but was thrown by its lack of taste. It felt like I was chewing on air with texture. No temperature, consistency, liquidity, or taste could be identified by my tongue. Then a few seconds into this, I’m hit with an overflowing wave of senses. 

The tactile feeling of the almonds against my teeth, and the feeling of the salt comingling with my saliva was alive, and very corporeal. I think it had to been the best thing I’ve ever eaten. Afterwards, we all watch the Pink Panther movie together as a family. Odd choice, but it was always my favorite as a child, and my children had adopted it as theirs following my footsteps so it was a family touchstone. That night I melted into Theodore’s arms. We lied in bed, staring at the ceiling for about an hour and a half, letting the TV we had tried to watch, (but now neglected) cycle on a weather channel. According to them, there’s clear skies and fair weather for the rest of the year. Not a drop of rain. 

We didn’t say a lot to each other. We wouldn’t really need to. We had a mutual understanding of what the other was feeling. Things were perfect, and if they had continued with this trend, I don’t think I would have much to write about, other than the surface level grandeur of the life, I’m living. 

The first concrete odd occurrence happened the next morning. One of the many joys of being Theo’s is that he always wakes up before me, and I get to watch him, be him, as he goes about his morning ritual, unaware of how charming he really is. I lie in my place in bed, looking through the doorway to the bathroom, as he checks off his morning boxes. Shaving, brushing his teeth, buttoning up his undershirt for work. I woke up to the sound of running water. I looked into the bathroom to see Theodore standing at the sink, shaving. It must’ve been my reflection in the mirror (it always is) I gave my voyeurism away. He looked back at me, shooting me a quick smile, before blowing me a kiss, and turning back to continue shaving.

 Finishing his shave off, Theo washed off the razor and dropped it back in the cup on the sink. Just then he stepped to THE LEFT of the room, walking towards our shelf, but the reflection in the mirror, went RIGHT, disappearing behind the wall that obscured part of the mirror. The hairs raised on my arm. Theo walked out, shirtless, smiling. 

“Did you see that?” I whispered. 

“See what?”

“Y-your reflection. It was different-”

I cut him off before he could reply-

“you walked to the shelf, but your reflection went to the right.”

Theodore turns back looking at the mirror as if he’d see it again. He walks towards it waving his arm like a child, expecting a response. He looks back at me with a half smug, half concerned expression. “Are you sure?” I hate when he does this. “Yes, incredibly.” I reply. We get into a short debate over the possibility and plausibility of what I saw. It ends in a stalemate of “whatever.” As I get out of bed to start my day. Who knows, it very well could’ve been some type of “thing,” I don’t know. A trick of the light, morning brain, whatever you wanna call it. But I can’t say this for the rest of my experiences.

The rest of that day was normal. Theo made breakfast (egg sandwiches on croissants with diced bacon bits). I drove the kids to school, and stopped & chatted with the crossing guard about the date of parent teacher conferences. Thursday.  

I drove to the grocery store immediately to restock on some items we were lacking, then went back home to begin the rest of my day. I work from home most days unless on the rare occasion where I have to go into a publisher’s office. I’m not sure if I’ve mentioned this yet but I’m an author. I tried my hand at non fiction-motivational word soup after I kicked my problem, but found that the creative side of me was really drawn to fantasy, and overtime I comfortably found my niche & some success. 
I found decent reviews & my sophomore novel was optioned for a film, but had fallen into development hell since that was announced. 

I settled into my office, loaded up Microsoft Word (not sponsored) and I burnt a good 6 hours off my day before, I went back out to get the kids, and later to pick up Theo. 

Then came dinner. The scent of simmering steak pranced its way into my nose, before the sound of Theodore calling everyone down, bellowed through the house. I found my way to the dining room, where Theo was already proudly standing next to the table, a sizzling steak resting on a wooden board in front of him. The aroma was intoxicating. Rich, smoky, and perfectly seasoned. We all took our respective places around the table. I don’t remember what we were talking about. Something related to visiting my mother’s house, when out of nowhere as if a flip was switched, the dining room table just flipped. 

Not as if it was thrown off the ground by an invisible force or tipped over but one second it was upright in the next upside down. Legs raced to the ceiling with a deafening jolt, as if it had indeed dropped, crushing cups and plates beneath it as it did. We all jumped the children (and myself) shrieking. I sat in stunned silence for a moment. Theo shot to his feet, “Is everyone okay?”

“Yeah-”

“Uh-huh.”

“Lola?”

I heard him. I even thought of a response. My tongue was too slow, too arrested to form a vowel…How? Why? 

“Honey?”

That got me. “Yeah, I’m fine.”

Theo suggested an Earthquake. Or something with the table. But he still seemed shook. Really, neither of them sufficed. And we all knew it. Or at least I did. Because by the time I had brought it up again that night, it was no longer an anomaly.

“It was an earthquake.” He asserted. I, as naturalistic as I am, thought this was incredibly stupid. Especially for him. Uniquely so infact, that it made me look sideways at him. What was even odder was Mylo & Sierra’s response. The next day on our drive to school I relitigated the topic with the two. 

“Last night was freaky huh?” I said, looking at them in the rearview mirror. 

“What was weird mom?” Mylo resisted. “Th-the table it flipped over.” 

“It was an earthquake.” Sierra responded. That was really something. The twins who both still fervently believed in the Tooth Fairy & Leprechauns - the same boy who made me sit by his side until he fell asleep because he was scared of the pink elephants from dumbo, was now downplaying the preternatural abnormality that was last nights dinner. My throat felt dry. My fingers tapped against the wheel as I turned onto the main road, eyes flicking back to the mirror. “You really don’t remember it just… flipping?” 

“It didn’t flip, Mommy,” Mylo said, voice calm. “The earthquake did it.” I swallowed my bottom lip and nodded. “Okay. The Earthquake.” I dropped them off at school with a lot on my mind. That night, I would’ve told Theo about the kids behavior, had he not also been a part of the “it was an earthquake” party. Maybe he told them that.

 I fell asleep at an average time that night, and was lulled by the sweet feeling of slumber, into what I can only describe as uncomfortable & disembodied dream. It started like all of them, in total black. Then, I felt my body being shaken around, like I was caught in an earthquake (a real one)

A droning hum filled the air, low and metallic, as if the world itself was groaning in pain. Then came the screaming—high-pitched, wet, and horribly human. Through the black and endless shrieking, I heard a masculine voice calling out to…me?

 “Ma’am! Ma’am!”

I was ripped out of the black and suddenly, thrown back into the car, wrecked and warped around the trunk of a tree. I knew where I was immediately. My head spun around the car, re-identifying what I already knew. Sierra hanging from her car seat. Mylo bent over forwards. And then Theo. But there was also someone else. 

“Ma’am, are you awake? I think we’ve got a live one. I can hear her rattling in there—”

My head oozed to face my shattered window, where I could make out through my haze the upside down figure of a man dressed in tight yellow leather, with a red helmet strapped to his head. 

A firefighter. 

Then black again. 

After stewing in black for a moment, I saw what I believe to be myself. A curled up woman lying in an endless field of nebulous vanta black, crying. 

And then it was morning. Sprinklers were running, Theo scurried down the stairs to go make breakfast, and I was covered in that hot sweat a good slumber usually yields. 

More than enough weird & surreal occurrences have happened these past few days to warrant me doing some form of research. And I’ve come up empty-handed, so now I turn to you, the people of the Internet, because as of right now, I really don’t know what the fuck is going on. Suggestions, ideas, anything would help at all.
