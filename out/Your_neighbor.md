My job is reading and evaluating surveys. I assume it won’t be around for long with all the AIs popping up but for now It's my job to read through and decide if a survey is valid or a joke. Most of the ones I throw away are filled with single-letter responses but one of the ones thrown away the other day really got to me. I mean I threw it away, so I think it's ok for me to share it. It was a neighborhood survey put on by an HOA, I think. For privacy, I won't say where it is. They mailed these out to all of their residents, so it was my job to manually verify the few that were returned. This was one of about 5 that were actually returned.

***How well would you say you know your neighbors?***

I know him, I see him. He watches me when I go to work, he drops his smile the second you look away. I know who he is supposed to be, I know what he is.

***How would you describe the current HOA rules and guidelines?***

He’s trying to make my life a living hell. I wake up to tire ruts in my yard, I get home, and my windows are broken. He’s trying to drive me out, he reports me to them before I even know it happens. He wants me to leave, he hates me.

***When would you say the neighborhood is most active?***

I can’t get any sleep at night. He put speakers outside of my house so I can’t sleep. It sounds like screaming but I don’t think it's him, it must be some animal sounds he found like a fox. I see him out there sometimes, it's too dark to see him but I’ve heard him tap on my windows, I’ve seen the light reflecting off his eyes when he looks. He doesn’t sleep.

***Do you have a home security system?***

He never comes inside. A security system wouldn’t do anything; they won’t let us have cameras on the side of the house because they know I'd catch him. I’ve set my phone against my window at night, but he knows, I hear the knocking at the other side of the house when I try to record him. If he ever entered my house, I'd defend myself.

***Have you ever had to call the authorities about something that happened in the neighborhood?***

They are in league with him too, I tried to call them the first night I saw him. My landline didn’t work, and I could see him outside of my window. He was staring at me. I shined my flashlight in his eye, and he stood there. He knew my phone didn’t work.

***Do you have any additional comments or concerns?***

I want him gone; I want to sleep again. I know that you’re reading this, I know that he is reading this. I will run you out of the neighborhood, I’ll burn you out if I have to. I was here first, you're an imitation.  


I omitted the address and personal information for obvious reasons, but the address was pretty close to mine. It’s been a couple days since I took this survey home and I've been hearing sounds outside of my house at night, I think it's a fox.
