**Six of us** went up into those hills. They never found any trace of us. The things we said, the things we did. All of it unthinkable before the storm.

But I **can't stay silent** any longer.

Despite my vow I have returned to civilization to share everything that happened at Loch Kaille.

Once you have read my story please don't think too harshly of me. That place, it does something to people. Something **Wicked**.

*

The drive up there seemed to take forever. Long, lonely roads skirted by endless thickets of heather and thistle.

Eventually, we pulled into a car park below a cluster of daunting Scottish hills. One of the hills was much larger than the others, a Monarch looming over its courtiers.

Two other cars were already present in the car park and a group of four people were standing around a pile of camping gear. Aaron and Max I already knew, and I would soon learn that the other two were Mona and Coll.

We parked up and I stepped out of the car. Aaron rushed over excitedly from the group.

**Aaron:** “Kate! We were starting to think you'd got lost.”

**Me:** “Nope, just fashionably late.”

As Aaron pulled me into a hug, Leon stepped out of my car.

**Leon:** “How does it feel to reach twenty-five, old man?” 

**Aaron:** “Hey, I've still got until midnight!”

**Leon:** “Plenty of time for depravity before then.”

**Aaron:** “Exactly!”

Aaron turned back to Max, Mona and Coll.

**Aaron:** “Guys, get over here!”

The others donned their rucksacks and gear, ready to do as the birthday boy had instructed. I noticed Coll struggling to lift a second rucksack. Aaron noticed as well.

**Aaron:** “I'll get that, Coll!”

As Aaron jogged over to grab his stuff, Leon came to my side with our gear. He dropped my backpack at my feet.

**Leon:** “Is that him?”
 
Leon was looking at Max, he was approaching us with the rest of the group.

**Me:** “Yeah, the tall guy on the left.”

**Leon:** “Just let me know if he steps out of line.”

We all converged and Aaron addressed everyone at once.

**Aaron:** “Guys, I just want to say thank you all so much for coming. I know most of you don't know each other, and some of you have come a long way, but for this trip I wanted to be with all my best friends.”

**Max:** “I only came to see what kind of backwards hole spat you out, Aaron.”

Mona and Coll both gave Max a dark look. However, Aaron laughed.

**Aaron:** “I think you'll learn to love this place, Max. I grew up around here with Mona and Coll. We had some great camping trips back in the day.”

**Me:** “At Loch Kaille?” 

**Aaron:** “Especially at Loch Kaille. It's a bit of a trek to get up there, but the scenery, the fishing. Guys, you're gonna love it.”

**Leon:** “As long as there's beer I'm happy anywhere.”

**Aaron:** “That's the spirit, Leon. Now, we're burning daylight so let's get moving.” 

And so Aaron led us out of the car park, towards the hills and then deep into the ancient forest growing over them.

*

Half an hour later we were walking along a forest trail in three distinct clusters. Aaron and Max were out in front, Mona and Coll were in the middle, and Leon and I were bringing up the rear.

I remember I stopped to take a picture of some woodland mushrooms with my camera. I examined the photo on my camera’s display screen.

**Me:** “Cute.”

Leon was fiddling with his phone beside me.

**Leon:** “Well you won't be posting your picture online. I had a sliver of signal in the car but this is a dead zone.”

**Me:** “Missing your Tinder profile already, Leon?”

**Leon:** “I was trying to get a weather update. The satellite picture looked pretty dodgy earlier.”

**Me:** “We're not supposed to be worrying about the forecast. Aaron wanted us to enjoy the scenery. For us all to bond.”

Leon pointed to the two clusters of people ahead of us.

**Leon:** “We won't be doing much bonding if we all stick to our little cliques.”

**Me:** “Good point.”

I broke into a brisk walk and headed towards Mona and Coll. I soon caught up with them.

**Me:** “Hey, Mona, Coll.”

**Mona:** “Hey. Kate, right?”

**Me:** “Yep. Thought I'd come and say hi. I've never met any of Aaron's friends from home before.”

**Mona:** “We don't get down south much. Aaron was always the high-flyer, destined for Canary Wharf. Same as you I suppose.”

**Me:** “Oh, I only went to university with Aaron.”

I pointed at Max, further along the trail.

**Me:** “That's the other banker up front.”

**Coll:** “I can think of a similar, better word to describe him.”

All three of us laughed.

**Mona:** “So what do you do?”

**Me:** “I'm an arts journalist. I've just been promoted to Assistant Features Editor, actually.”

**Mona:** “Congratulations.”

**Me:** “Thanks. What about you guys?”

**Mona:** “We both work at our local supermarket.”

**Me:** “Oh. Well, that's good too.”

A moment later Aaron shouted from beyond a bend in the trail, saving me from my awkwardness.

**Aaron:** “Guys, check it out!”

We all sped up to see what Aaron had found.

Around the trail bend I saw that Aaron had led us to the bank of a river, the water clear and fast-flowing. Large rocks sliced through the surface forming small cascades of white water.

**Me:** “Have we come the wrong way?”

Aaron laughed.

**Aaron:** “No, this is the river crossing. It's the only way up to the loch.”

**Max:** “Isn't there a bridge or something?”

Aaron put a hand on Max's shoulder.

**Aaron:** “This is the wilderness, bud. It doesn't really do bridges.”

Aaron pulled his hand away and spoke up.

**Aaron:** “Guys, the water may look menacing, but it's really shallow. Mona, Coll and I have crossed it loads of times, right guys?”

**Mona:** “Yeah, and you only ever went arse over tit once, Aaron.”

We all chuckled, relieving some of the apprehension.

**Aaron:** “I think we'll mix it up a bit. I'll take Kate and Leon over first. Max, you cross with Mona and Coll once we've made it to the other side.”

We regrouped and then Aaron led me and Leon out into the shallowest part of the river. The water didn't come past our ankles, but we still had to shout to be heard over the rush.

**Me:** “The stones are so slippery!”

**Aaron:** “Just make sure you have a good purchase before you transfer your weight!”

**Leon:** “What does that even—”

**Me:** “*Aghh*!”

I'd jammed my foot between two rocks, and I was flapping my arms in an attempt to keep my balance against the current.

Aaron was there in an instant. He grabbed one of my arms and steadied me, allowing me to free my foot.

**Aaron:** “Okay?” 

**Me:** “Yeah. Got my foot stuck. Wasn't concentrating, sorry.”

**Aaron:** “Not a problem. Okay to go on?”

I nodded, and then we continued across the river.

We made it to the other side without further incident, out of the water and onto a pebbly shore. I sat down on a smooth boulder in order to catch my breath.

**Me:** “Thanks, Aaron. For a moment I thought I was going in.”

**Aaron:** “Don't worry, you're always safe with me.”

Mona called out from the other side of the river.

**Mona:** “Everything okay?”

Aaron yelled back.

**Aaron:** “Everything's fine! You can cross now!”

Mona began to lead the rest of the group across as Aaron watched on.

**Leon:** “Kate, what are those?”

Leon was pointing to my side. On the edge of my boulder there was a neat pile of pebbles. I picked one up and inspected it. The pebble had a smooth, warped hole in its centre.

**Me:** “It's got a weird hole in it.”

**Leon:** “So do all the others.”

Looking back at the pile I saw that Leon was right. Each stone had a hole in it.

**Leon:** “Aaron, look at this.”

Aaron turned from watching the rest of the group cross the river and looked at what I was holding. 

**Aaron:** “Let me see.”

I tossed him the pebble. Aaron snatched it from the air and examined it.

**Aaron:** “Ah, you've found yourself a Hag Stone.”

**Me:** “Why is there a hole in it?”

**Aaron:** “The river did it. The current gradually wears away at the centre and forms the hole.”

Aaron held the Hag Stone up to his eye and looked from me to Leon through the hole.

**Aaron:** “Witches used to believe that looking through the hole in a Hag Stone let you see hidden truths, even peer into other worlds. It's said that if a witch looks at you through one of these she can inflict doom upon your soul.”

A shiver ran down my spine but Leon was putting on a brave front.

**Leon:** “Really? Witches?”

Aaron lowered the Hag Stone.

**Aaron:** “I'm serious. Hundreds of years ago these hills were known as a refuge for witches. Loch Kaille is even named for them. Coll's dad told me that the word Kaille comes from 'cailleach' – Gaelic for witch.”

**Me:** “There are more Hag Stones here. Look, a pile of them.”

**Leon:** “You gonna tell us a witch put them there, Aaron?”

**Aaron:** “Of course not, it's just dumb folklore. People around here used to believe that cheese was magic too.”

Aaron tossed the Hag Stone back to me. I caught it.

**Me:** “But how did the Stones get here? This boulder is way above the water level.”

**Aaron:** “The river isn't always this low. It rises and falls. It probably dropped them there the last time it flooded. Or some hikers came through and collected them.” 

I wasn't convinced and Aaron seemed to sense it. Smiling, he stepped forwards and reached out a hand. I took it and he pulled me upright.

**Aaron:** “That foot taking your weight okay?”
 
I nodded as the rest of the group arrived on the shore. Mona gave me and Aaron a charged look.

**Mona:** “Are we good to carry on?”

Aaron dropped my hand and bounded up the shore.

**Aaron:** “Yep! Only a ruthless hill climb separating us from the campsite now.”

The others let him pass and then trailed after him.

**Leon:** “Come on, Kate.”

Leon followed on as I looked thoughtfully at the Hag Stone, wondering what I should do with it.

Finally, I slipped it into my pocket and trudged after Leon.

*

The hill climb was a slog. Trust Aaron to drag us up the tallest hill for miles around.

Just when I thought my legs were about to drop off, Aaron led us all out of the pines and into a small forest clearing. There was a circle of rocks on the ground in the centre, and four log benches surrounding them.

**Aaron:** “Wow! The campsite is just how I remember it. It's not overgrown, or rotten, or…”

Aaron turned to Mona and Coll.

**Aaron:** “…Did you?”

**Mona:** “Coll and I came up last weekend and cleared it out. Happy birthday, Aaron.”

Aaron took Mona and Coll into a group hug.

**Aaron:** “Thanks, guys!”

As Aaron released them from his hug, I noticed Mona was blushing.

**Mona:** “More time to party, right?”

Max stepped past the group, further into the campsite.

**Max:** “Good on the yokals for doing the housework, but I don't see any water, Aaron.”

Aaron pointed to his left.

**Aaron:** “The loch is just through those trees. We can be there in five minutes now we don't have to tidy up.”

**Me:** “Shouldn't we set up the tents first? Then we don't have to worry about rushing back before nightfall.”

Max pulled a beer from the side of his rucksack and opened it.

**Max:** “Lady's got a point. I plan on being smashed by nightfall. No way will I be able to insert tab A into slot B.”

**Aaron:** “Kate and Mona will be relieved to hear that, Max.”

Max snorted out his beer, laughing.

**Aaron:** “Come on, guys, let's get these tents sorted.”

*

Within the hour I was lying on the lochshore in my bathing suit, soaking up the sunshine. Leon and Coll were sitting beside me on my picnic blanket.

Leon was fiddling with a fishing rod, line and trout spinner and Coll was looking out across the loch. In the water, Aaron, Max and Mona were splashing about, playing some sort of game.

Aaron lifted up a screaming Mona and dunked her into the water. Mona surfaced and, laughing, splashed Aaron back.

**Coll:** “It's good to see Mona laughing like that.”

**Me:** “Were you worried Mona wasn't going to enjoy the trip, Coll?”

**Coll:** “No, it's just that there aren't that many eligible bachelors around here.”

**Leon:** “What about yourself, Coll? You're a good-looking guy.”

**Coll:** “Thanks, but Mona isn't exactly my *type*.”

**Leon:** “Ah. Read you loud and clear, my friend.” 

I noticed that Leon was nearly done tackling up his fishing rod.

**Me:** “All set, Leon? I'm looking forward to a nice trout fillet for my supper.”

**Leon:** “I think so. My uncle used to take me sea fishing when I was a kid, but I don't really know where the fish would be in a loch.”

**Me:** “Maybe try underwater?”

**Leon:** “Very funny.”

**Coll:** “There's a rocky outcrop at the other end of the shore, we used to get some good takes there. I can show you if you like?”

**Leon:** “That'd be awesome, thank you.”

Leon and Coll got to their feet.

**Leon:** “Coming, Kate?”

**Me:** “Maybe later. I want to soak up some rays whilst the sun's out.”

**Leon:** “No problem. Tell the others where we went.”

As Leon and Coll walked away I leaned my head back, enjoying the warmth of the sun on my cheeks. Until a breeze ruffled a communal pile of clothes near to where Coll had been sitting.

Remembering what I had found by the river, I sat up and reached into my trouser pocket.

I pulled out my **Hag Stone**.

Like Aaron had done at the river crossing, I raised the Stone to my eye and peered through the hole. First, I looked to the trio still splashing in the water. Then, I watched Leon and Coll walking along the lochshore. Next, I turned my head and looked through the Hag Stone at the trees nearest to the shore.

A tall figure wearing tattered robes and some kind of antler headdress gazed back at me from the treeline. Half a deer skull concealed the figure's face and, as I stared into what were dark holes in place of eyes, my blood ran cold.

Slowly, the figure raised a bony hand. A hand with six fingers.

I dropped my Hag Stone as I felt a burning sensation on the inside of my forearm. I watched in horror as **six red marks** appeared on my skin, like someone had just seared them onto me with a red-hot poker.

Despite the pain, I looked up and watched the figure turn and then walk into the pines.

As the figure disappeared amongst the trees, I realised I was screaming.
