James sat on his bed this morning. The thing is, he shouldn’t have been awake again. I watched him die yesterday. 



On our expedition, he fell into a river and was carried away by the current. 



He tried to grab onto the surrounding rocks, but soon his body disappeared into the waterfall.



The river was known for accidents. The locals said it had evil powers.



I sat on the bank crying profusely. 



I decided to contact the central station tomorrow. That night, I didn’t have it in me to tell anyone that my close friend was deceased.



The morning after, the sunbeams woke me up before my alarm rang. I sat up on my bed, my eyes were still puffed up from crying. When I finally managed to open them, I screamed out and fell off my bed.



On the other bed sat James; he was still wet, his skin pale, almost bluish, his lips devoid of color, the whites of his eyes turning green, and his eyes set deep into his head.



He sat there staring at me for a few seconds.



“Hey Mark,” James' voice sounded damp and rusty.



“Ja…James…”



“But, you…the river”



“I also don’t know how. I woke up at the bank, still wet. My head throbbing, my body weak, but I managed to walk back.”



“But your skin, your lips.”



“Yeah, that’s not the weirdest. Come here.”



I stood up and stared at him.



“Mark, you’re overthinking.”



“I saw the river carry you away yesterday.”



He sighed and touched his wrist, “I have no pulse.”



My eyes widened, and my mouth hung open.



I came closer to him. His skin was even paler than I thought at first. He smelled of wet mud.



 I touched his hand. There really was no pulse.



“See what I mean?”



“Jesus, James.”



I quickly rushed to the medical cabinet and pulled out a blood pressure monitor.



The blood pressure cuff tightened around his arm and then slowly deflated.



No reading.



“James, we need to contact the station.”



James got up and grabbed my hand. It was cold and damp.



“Mark, wait, wait. We….we don’t know what they’ll say.”



“What?”



“What if….what if they decide to leave me here, or worse….do stuff to me.”



“James, don’t worry, we’re renowned academics; the institutions wouldn’t let anything happen to you.”



He still had a look of concern.



“Okay, James, I’ll be vague, and you can tell them the details later.”



He nodded.



I walked to the other room and picked up the satellite phone.



“Dispatch, this is the senior researcher. My research partner fell into the river yesterday. He managed to survive, but I request immediate medical help.”



“This is dispatch. We are sending a boat immediately. What is your partner’s state?”



“He is conscious and communicating. No major injuries.”



“And you said he got carried by the river?”



“Yes”



Rattling. I could hear the headset being put down and quiet voices talking.



“Field station, what is the color of your partner’s sclerae?”



“What….?”



“This is important. Please answer the question.”



“Um….they’re a sort of greenish-like color.”



A second of silence.



“Help is on the way. We are unable to provide additional information. Be wary of any dangerous behavior from your research partner.”



Then static.



“Dispatch, dispatch?!”



Nothing.



I lowered the phone and stood up. My head was spinning, and my hands began shaking.



I looked into the other room, and James was still sitting on the bed.



In the cabinet, I only found a flare gun. I quickly put it behind my belt.



Hopefully, I wouldn’t have to use it.



When I came back to the room, James looked up. His sclerae were turning greener.



“What did they say, Mark?”



“Oh, er….they are sending a boat immediately to come and pick us up.”



“Okay, did they say anything about me?”



“No, no, don’t worry about it.”



“I’m exhausted. I might go and sleep for a while.”



“Sure, they will arrive in like 5 hours. I’ll wake you before that.”



James didn’t even answer. His body slowly fell onto the bed. Mud started leaking out of his mouth.



I sat on the foot of my bed, staring at him.



My heart was beating fast. I didn’t even notice that a few hours had already passed.



I tried to wake him up, but he wouldn’t at first.



Then his eyes shot open. They were completely green and shining bright. 



He quickly sat up and said something I couldn’t understand.



Then he let out a roar and grabbed hold of me.



“James, what are you doing?!”



He pushed me to the ground and grabbed my neck. 



His hands were still cold, and the squeeze was tight.



Mud from his mouth was falling onto my face.



My consciousness was slipping, but I managed to pull out my flare gun. 



The room was coloured in bright red as I shot it into his stomach. 



The bang was so loud it made my ears ring.



He let out a scream of pain and stumbled a few feet back. Muddy water mixed with blood oozed out of his wound.



I bolted for the door, running through the jungle.



Adrenaline flooded my body.



Vines were smacking my face.



Then the boat. 



I jumped into the river and waded towards it.



But James’ roars were getting closer.



I looked back. 



He was already in the river.



One of the people in the boat got up and shot him in the head.



His body slouched down and began drifting on the stream.



Back at the station, I was interrogated about what happened that day, but whenever I tried to ask for an explanation, they told me to shut up.



“You'd better not speak of this to anyone if you want to keep your academic career.”



“No one would even believe him,” the other agent said, laughing.



“If anyone asks about your research partner, he died in the river, as you saw.”



I’m sitting in the airport waiting for my flight.



I just went to the bathroom. My sclerae are starting to turn green, too.



The bathroom light made them look greener, like water from a river.
