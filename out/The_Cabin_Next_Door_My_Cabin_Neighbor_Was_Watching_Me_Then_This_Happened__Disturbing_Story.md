I began subletting a rental house cabin for a couple months in 2023 when my dad and I
were bucking heads and I needed to move out. The actual renter of the apartment,
whom I'll just refer to as my landlord to make it easier, was having his own personal
issues causing him to leave the apartment. 

The cabin was an entire unit rental and it
was paid month to month, which was ideal for my temporarily shitty situation.
It was two floors, technically: a small kitchen, decent-sized living space, and one
bedroom that you had to climb a little flight of stairs to get to. 

There was a quirky
hatch-type door that you'd have to open to get to the upstairs bedroom. I had already
been there for a month; I paid for the second month's rent already by this point, so I was
fully situated there.
The cabin sat at the end of a dirt road with a few other similarly sized cabin-type
houses. 

One was vacant, as far as I knew, because I never saw cars parked out front or
lights on. The other houses, well, I never met the neighbors, but I knew people lived in
them.

I work 12-hour shifts sometimes, and when I get home, I'm completely exhausted and
will just go straight to bed and watch TV until I fall asleep. This was one of those nights.
I got home, made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a protein shake as my
late-night dinner, then went to bed.

 I always shut the door in the floor every night. I find
myself to be uncomfortable at night having the entrance to your bedroom open;
something about it makes me feel exposed or vulnerable. Though this door in the floor
didn't have a lock, this cabin was made for one person or a couple.

I was watching TV in bed when I heard itâ€”a voice from down below saying, "who's up
there?" I instantly felt my heart stop for a second as I shot up to an upright position. It
sounded like it came from inside the house, but it also could have maybe come from
outside. I grabbed the TV remote to turn off the TV.

 I crawled over to look at the circular
window above the bed. I didn't see anyone out there, but it was also very dark.
I said, "who's there?" and the deafening silence that followed afterwards led me to
getting off the bed and putting my hand on the handle to the door. I lifted the door and
looked down the staircase. I actually said my dad's name, thinking maybe he came over.
There was no response.


I was so tired earlier that I left it in the center console. I went back inside; the TV was
still on up in the bedroom. I climbed the stairs, and when I got to the top, I saw someone
sitting on my bed staring at the TV.

 It was a man. I screamed, and he turned his head
slowly to look at me, and before I could see anything else, I ran back down the stairs and
outside, and now with my phone called 911.
I sat in my locked car watching the house on the line with 911, and I saw someone
walking past the backyard of the house disappearing into the woods. I told the operator
this when a police car arrived. 

The one officer checked the house and upstairs room
after I told him that I saw someone, most likely the intruder, walk away into the woods.
He asked if I had any other places to stay that night, and so I swallowed my pride and
went back to my dad's house for the night after packing some of my important stuff.
I returned to the house the next day and stayed another night, then collected the rest of
my stuff.

 Luckily, the landlord agreed to giving me some of my money back. He asked
me what the man looked like, and after that, he didn't ask any more questions, which to
me is pretty sus. Something was unusual in that situation, from that creepy neighbor
ignoring me to the landlord's random urgent need to move out to someone falling or
breaking into the house. Maybe it's all connected or maybe I'm overthinking.
