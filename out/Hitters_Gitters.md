Simple innocent words....twisted and corrupted.

"Hitters gitters!" Jamie shouted.

"You gotta be kidding me!?" Gary replied sharply.

"Rules are rules,"  Shrugged Jamie with a grin.

"Hey, I don't mind playing by the rules when it's a bad pass, but you practically let the ball roll right past you!"

We had been aimlessly wandering the neighbourhood, passing a ball back and forth to each other as we went.  It was a meagre source of entertainment to keep us occupied while we hoped to stumble upon something more interesting.  But as usual, this town was as boring as it was small, and unwilling to deliver.

”You know what” said Gary extending his hands outwards. "Fine...I'll get the damn ball, but I'll remember this next time you mess up, asshole."

He put on a light jog down the street, passing by Jamie, and towards the ball.  Jamie swivelled to watch him pass with the same grin still plastered on his face.

"You lazy, bastard."  Ryan said, shaking his head.  "You were way closer!  You should have just went an got the stupid ball."

"That's not the point," said Jamie."He hit it. He gets it. Simple."
