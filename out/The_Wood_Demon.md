Where was I? Yes yes, The Wood Demon.


“Stop touching me! Stop! Stooop!” Addi Shouted in the backseat of my mother’s car. Something that was totally unfair given I was barely even pushing her away from my side of the car, which was MY SIDE OF THE CAR.

“Hey!” My mom snapped from the front seat, “Knock that off, leave her alone.”

“She’s in my -” I started.

“I don’t care. Addi, leave your brother alone, you know what side of the car you’re supposed to be on.” 

“But he-”

“Don’t Start Lyi-”

“Quiet!” Mom barked “We’ve got two more hours of this car ride and I don’t want to have to pull this car over and beat both of your asses.”

Addi and I fell silent.

“It’s not- look, I don’t want to yell at you guys. I’m just… could you guys just try to be a little quieter back there?”

We pulled into the driveway of what was supposed to be our new house. A drab two story A frame with woods surrounding the property. Brown leaves covered the dying grass, occasionally moving in groups on the wind. In the new dusk the woods seemed to go on forever.

“It might not look like much, but I think we can spruce it up! Can’t we Addi?” Mom asked from the front seat. She sounded sad, but hopeful. Maybe she was trying to convince herself.

“Yeah! We can paint it yellow and purple! And we can build a biig tower on the side, '' Addi mused.

Mom laughed, “The last owner said that the woods are all part of the land! Haven’t you ever wanted to live in the forest?” I looked at Addi, and she looked back, we had not ever wanted to live in a forest. 

“Yeesh! With all the bugs and the flies? No thank you!” Addi said

Inside was not much better than the outside, I was half surprised that the lights worked. She’d told us that the movers would be here next week so we’d have to live on the few suitcases of clothes that we brought until then. After we’d unpacked she said she was going outside to order us some pizza.

From my room on the second floor I could see her smoking a cigarette on the front porch. That was new.

“Addi we really shouldn’t be yelling like we were in the car,” I gently scolded her.

“But you were **touching** me,” She retorted.

“Well you shouldn’t have been in my space!” I shot back in anger. I knew she was wrong and dumb but I needed her on my side, so I decided to let it go. “Look, mom is- is stressed, and we can’t be making things harder for her okay?”

“Because of dad?”

“Yeah.”

“Where is he?”

“I don’t know. Mom says she doesn’t know either.” I replied. I didn’t know if that was true or not. 

“Well when is he coming back?” Addi asked sheepishly.

“I don’t know,” I said quietly, anger and then guilt at that anger welling up inside me.

Addi wasn’t that much younger than me, only a few years, but she didn’t know what it was like to be the big brother. She was young, and dad always said I was supposed to protect her. I wondered if that counted if she was the one who got us into this mess.

The front door opened and closed.

“Look, could you just agree to try to stop fighting so much for a while?” I asked, with rising desperation.

“Sure.” Addi said, and then added, “I love you.” She spoke those last three words as though she was reaching out.

“I… love you too”

Things were rocky. School was different, and the kids were different here. I was quiet, and people seemed to be silently judging me, almost like they were seeing where I fit. I didn’t really feel like I fit in anywhere. And that was beginning to become apparent to some of the kids.

Dad never called or anything.

It turned out Addi and I actually did like the woods outside of the house, and for a while that was what I looked forward to after school. But suddenly that changed.

One day, after school, we were following our new normal routine. Addi and I usually took the bus home, and then we’d play outside in the woods until mom would get home. The sun was low, we were adventuring around, I think I was some sort of wizard and maybe Addi was a goblin; I always made her be the goblin if I could. The wind was beginning to pick up and the sun finally dipped below whatever hill was the last stop on its route before night. I felt that sensation of coldness that one gets when the sun disappears, and knew that we had to head back soon. 

The coldness reminded me of the way buildings would obscure the sun back home in Chicago. It was cool to play out here but I missed my dad, and I wished that he would just come back. It had been months since we’d left, and he hadn’t so much as texted to ask about us. At least not that mom would tell me. I wished Adalind hadn’t messed everything up. I just wanted him back. Maybe if she wasn’t around he would be.

Suddenly the woods fell silent. Everything, even the wind, held its breath. Addi looked at me wide eyed and confused. The coldness on the back of my neck grew into an icy fear that twisted around my spine. I was about to say we should head back and then we heard it.

There was some sort of noise, faint at first, but it started to get louder. It was almost rhythmic.

Something was *singing*. 

I couldn’t make out the words yet, but I didn’t want to find out. I turned to Addi to tell her to get into the house.

Her eyes were fixed on a point behind me, she raised her hand and pointed. “Who’s that Josh?”

The singing stopped.

I whirled around and saw something. It looked like a man, a long white man, but he was turned away from us. He slowly began to turn towards us. I could hear the trees creaking. I looked back towards Addi and fought the Lump of terror that was beginning to form in my throat. “Run!” I cried rushing towards Addi and grabbing her hand.

“What is that, Josh?” Addi said more urgently this time, fear growing in her eyes.

“I don’t know but we need to get inside!” I tried to assure her, though I was terrified myself.

We rushed back to the house and Addi began to cry. Once we were in, I locked all the doors and closed the curtains. I kept peering out the windows, my hands gripped on our wood paneled walls. Addi continued to cry.

After about 15 minutes, with no sign of the man, I was fed up and yelled at her. “What are you whining about? I locked all the doors, there’s no way that guy got in.”

Addi didn’t stop crying but pointed all around us. My stomach dropped, had I forgotten to lock the back door? Or had he crept in through a window? I imagined the tall man standing behind me and thought of all the sorts of things that he could do to Addi and I. I didn’t want to look, but I figured I’d have to eventually. I gathered my courage and shot my head up.

To look straight at nothing but the wood paneling that was on just about every wall in the house. 

“What? You’re afraid of the walls?” I almost laughed at her.

Addi shook her head and reiterated pointing at the walls, “The wa- walls… the walls have faces,” she struggled out, her words racked with sobs.

I looked again to see what she could be worried about. Actually, she was right. On each of the panels, slightly different each time there were three knots that kind of looked like a gnarled face, complete with a wispy gnarled smile. I was a little spooked myself, but they weren’t alive or anything. And it was my job as big brother to prove it to her. If nothing else, at least it would get our mind off of the woods.

“Addi, that's not a monster,” I said, trying to get her to cheer up.

She didn’t budge from her teary, terrified state.

“I’ll prove it to you.” I said, and then dashed off to the kitchen to grab a knife. If she needed a monster slain I was the one who was going to slay it. 

I arrived in the kitchen and began rifling through the drawers for the biggest knife I could find. Having found it I turned around to be greeted with more wood paneling. More of that same face in the same spot. This time I dashed back to Adalind more for my sake than hers. 

“Mom says not to run with sharp things,” Addi chided as I raced into the living room, knife in hand. 

“Hush! Now observe, as your fearless brother shows you that this wood is not a monster!” I said with a dramatic flourish. “Hraah!” I shouted, plunging my blade into the wood panel. “Take that you, rat-scallion!” I said, continuing my assault.

“What’s a rat-scallion?” Addi giggled.

“I don’t know, I saw it in a movie one time, I think you’re calling them a big rat” I said. Then, mustering up my best knight impression, I said, proudly, “Would you like a turn on the rat-scallion?”

The door flew open and I jumped, expecting to see the tall man. It was so much worse.

Mom was standing there. 

“Joshu- Joshua! What the hell are you doing?” Mom yelled.

“Well there was a-”

“What did you do to the wall?!” She launched another volley at me.

“Mom I was just trying to- to-” I began to plead but I knew that it would sound stupid. There wasn’t anything I could do that was going to make this right.

“To what?!” she screeched. “I mean god-damnit! Hand me the knife - Hand me the knife!”

“I- I didn’t mean to” I started crying but handed the knife out to her as gently as I could.

She sighed, knife safely in her hands, before asking,“Did you take meat out?”

I was in deep.

“There was a man” I said frantically

“What?” My mom asked, puzzled.

I scrabbled for more time,“There was a man in the woods.”

“What? Nuh-uh Josh, I’m not going to let one of your stories distract me” She countered.

“I’m Serious, he was there, wasn’t he Addi?” I had a sudden thought “Maybe it was Dad! Maybe he was trying to find us!”

“Joshua, Stop making up stories!” She sounded almost desperate.

“Is dad trying to find us mom?” Addi timidly asked

She looked down at Addi, “No - He - Look, was there a man outside or not?” She said as she turned back to me.

“Yes! There was, I promise.” I said, holding my hand up like I was pledging.

“Addi, is Josh telling the truth?” She turned back to Addi and knelt down beside her.

Addi looked at the wood paneling, and then back at me, she looked somber. “I don’t think there was a man.” she said softly.

I was in shock.

“Joshua, get into your room, now you’re in trouble for lying too.”

---

After my incident with the wall I was grounded, whatever grounded meant for a 11 year old boy with no friends and no phone. But mom was always kind of a pushover about “Grounded”. Addi and I stopped playing outside. She said it was because of the cold, but we both knew what the real cause was. Things got worse at school, I began dreading every hour that I was there. Mom took on another job to try and make sure that we had enough. She was barely ever at the house. I was lonely.

For a while I talked to the woods, wondering if that really was my dad, and maybe my mom had said something to him that made it so he couldn’t come to the house. But he never talked back. And so I stopped.

Addi started to change.Her stunt made things distant between us. And so at first I didn’t notice. She played by herself now, and I could often hear her talking. At first I thought that maybe she was missing dad, and talking to him like I did, but then I started hearing her muttering to herself and talking at night. I asked her why she was talking at night and if she was talking to dad. She said she was talking to ‘the Wood Man’. I asked if that was the man that we had seen in the woods and she just pointed to the faces on the wall’s wood panels. She looked sleepy, and I could tell that she had lost weight. I realized this was the first time in the weeks since we’d heard the woods singing that I’d really looked at her. She looked so small.

“Addi?” I asked “Why did you lie about the guy that we saw in the woods?”

“The Wood Man told me not to say that I saw him” She said before going back to her toys. “I… love you” She said sheepishly

“I… know” I replied

I decided that I needed to find out what the wood man was.

Over the next week I tried to stay up as late as I could, to try and catch her talking at night, but exhaustion would claim me, and I’d always wake up the next morning. On the 6th night, sleep took me as it had five nights before, but I woke up in the middle of the night. At first I didn’t know why, but I strained my ears to see if there was something that had woken me up.

It was Addi. She was singing. I was filled with determination to find out what was wrong with her. As I crept down the hallway to her room, I realized it was that same tune that we’d heard in the woods a month ago. I approached the door and held my ear to it to listen. When I did she stopped.

“What?” She said “He’s outside?”

She waited but I didn’t hear a response

“Oh outside the door! Well you’d better go… Okay I’ll see you later.” She said before speaking a little louder and directly to me. “You can come in now, Josh”

I opened the door to see Addi standing on her bed looking at the doorway.

“Who were you talking to?” I asked

“The Wood Man, He said that you were spying on us behind the door. He says it’s rude to spy.” She replied, half sleepily.

“How did he know I was here?” I asked sheepishly, afraid to check behind myself.

“How do you think?” She said, yawning and pointing at the wall.

A little spooked I said, “I think you should stop talking to the Wood Guy, I don’t like it.”

“The Wood Man doesn’t really care what you think, Josh. He’s a nice guy and he likes you even though you tried to hurt him. Anyway I’m tired, could you close my door please?”

As I turned around to leave the room she said, “He says he misses when you’d talk to him in the woods”

I shuddered and didn’t look back as I made my way back to my room. I tried to sleep but all I could think of was all those wooden faces in the walls looking down on me.

---

The next night I decided to try and catch whatever this Wood Man was. I knew it was possible that it was just some imaginary friend she had made up, but I also knew that what we’d seen in the woods was very real. And I hated to think she was talking to some stranger.

I tried to stay up as long as I could, but because I hadn’t slept last night I was exhausted. I could feel myself fading, and I had almost drifted off when I started to hear that faint singing.

I was filled with fear and anger, but anger won, and so I ran to Adalind’s room. If something was there I wasn’t going to let it get away this time, and so I burst into the room. 

What I saw horrified me.

There was some kind of gnarled being made out of the same pale wood that the wood panels were made out of. It stretched out of the wall, it’s half form looking at my sister, arm outstretched. It’s eyes, or what would have been it’s eyes if they weren’t two empty knots focused on me. 

I screamed and called out for my mom. Its grotesque form turned towards me and reached out with its gnarled wooden hands. I screamed again, but could hear my mom rushing up the stairs, and turned towards the door 

I yelled, “Mom please, it’s here, the Wood Man is-” I abruptly stopped as she entered the room and threw the light on - revealing absolutely nothing.

“What’s the matter?” My mom asked. “Addi, did someone try and get into your room?”

“No” Addi said calmly

“Mom, can we please go?” I pleaded, “We shouldn’t stay in this house, it’s bad mom”

“Josh, just a minute” She said while moving to check out the window “There’s doesn’t look like any tracks in the snow on this part of the roof”

I looked at Adalind with fury in my eyes “You are talking to that thing?!” I shouted.

“What’s he talking about Addi?” Mom asked Adalind calmly, putting her hands on Adalind’s face. “Oh my goodness baby you look so tired, are you okay?” 

“She’s been talking to that thing! The Wood Man or whatever,” I cut in. I turned to Adalind “Was that what we saw?” I snarled.

“What thing? What’s the Wood Man?” my mom asked, trying to defuse the situation.

“It’s nothing mom, can I sleep now?” Adalind said, hugging mom.

“He’s a man that Addi talks to at night, and he was what we saw in the woods - We need to go! We need to leave this place” I said, the fear rising in me as I could see all the faces in the wood around me. 

“We can’t just leave,” My mom said incredulously.

“You’re not listening to me!” I shouted “I hate it here! I **hate** it here, and I don’t want to be here anymore.”

“Don’t say that, it’s not that bad Josh.” my mom warned.

“Would you just listen to me for once? This place is bad and we shouldn’t have come here.”

“I understand you don’t like It Joshua, but we can’t just up and leave. I’m sorry.” My mom rose back at me.

I could feel my anger boiling inside me: dad not being here, the kids at school making fun of me, and mom not ever being home all came down to one thing. And so I focused on what it was that had caused me so much pain,

“You.” I said to Adalind “I hate *you*.”

“Wha-”

“Joshua!” my mom cried as she tried to smother the boiling words in my throat

“I hate you because we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you, you’re the reason dad left” I spat. 

“What? Mom, is that True?” Addi tried to get out.

“Joshua!”

“Mom, is that True?!” Addi began to cry

“Yes! and now we’re stuck in this stupid house because of it.” I seethed.

“Joshua go to your room, I will see you there in a minute.” My mother commanded.

She turned back to Adalind and tried to console her “No- honey no, your father didn’t leave because of you- he didn’t…” I couldn’t hear the rest as I stomped off towards my room. 

I sat there fuming for a couple minutes, then my anger began to sputter out as those minutes dragged on. I shouldn’t have said that. Addi had no way of knowing that she was the reason. And I was scared because of that thing. Guilt racked me. She wasn’t supposed to know that. But what in the hell was that thing? After about 5 minutes I heard Addi’s door quietly close and then I heard my mother stomp down the hallway towards my room. She burst in.

“What the hell did you say that to your sister for?” she hissed.

“I was angry- I know I shouldn’t have said it” I tried to say.

“Why would you say that?”

“I know we’ve been trying to hide it from her, it just slipped out.”

“Hide what from her? Josh, what are you talking about?”

“I heard him, I heard dad that night when he left. He said there was too many people in the house, and we didn’t have enough room,” I said, tears welling in my eyes. “And then he left. And I know that Addi didn’t do anything but maybe if she wasn’t there the house wouldn’t be too big. But maybe I should have gone and then he’d still be here” I croaked as the tears fell freely now.

“Joshua, that’s… not what your dad left over,” She said, as she knelt down and put her arms around me. “He was mad because - Well I - Josh I found out that I was pregnant.” She struggled to get out.

I looked up in confusion. “You’re having a baby?” I asked.

“Um, no Josh, but I was, and your dad didn’t want a bigger family. But I… wasn’t ready to give that up. And so he left.” She said, tears now also falling from her eyes. “And I… wanted to move somewhere where we could have that big family”

I looked up at her, confused and said “But if you were pregnant what -”

We both were startled by the sound of glass shattering.

“What was that?” Mom asked.

“I think it came from Addi’s room” I said, realizing what that might mean.

I jumped from my mom’s arms and rushed down the hall. Throwing open the door, I saw that the room was empty, and the window was broken.

My mom trailed behind me and came into the room.

“What’s going on? Where’s Addi?”

“Mom, I think that thing took her!” I said, panic rising in my chest.

“What thing? What are you talking about?”

“The Wood Man! I was trying to tell you about it earlier but you weren’t listening.”

“The man you saw in the woods? Is that what -”

We both stopped as we heard the sound of singing coming out of the woods around us.

“We need to save her! We have to go get her!” I screamed, before bolting down the stairs to the kitchen.

I skidded into the kitchen and yanked open the knife drawer grabbing the knife I had the first day that we experienced the Wood Man. I turned to leave out the back door and saw the faces in the walls all begin to stretch and distort, reaching out for me.

They sang to me. They told me that they just wanted to help me.  

I ran out the backdoor as fast as I could manage and sprinted towards the woods.

As I reached the edge of our yard I could hear my mother call out for me, but I didn’t have time. I had to find Addi, and so I followed the sound of the singing.

I ran for as long as I could, my breath becoming more and more ragged and sweat covering my brow. I could hear the singing becoming louder and I began to make out what it was saying. It kept repeating this one verse:

*Palewood Palewood, Listen to thoughts, grant us our desire
Where the Wood Demon crawls, The palewood grows tall, And we’ll build on great pyre
Heed the singing tree my child, listen to it’s song
It gives and takes, and wishes it makes, before the day is long*

As I ran deeper into the woods the trees began to grow thicker. My path was only illuminated by the moon, but that was quickly being covered by trees. The singing was louder now, it was all I could hear.

My foot snagged a root and I tripped, falling onto my knife. I felt warm blood run down my thigh. My sister’s words echoed in my ear. I wished we had never come here, but more than that I wished I hadn’t pushed her away. I struggled to my feet and walked on.

The music grew steadily louder and faster until it reached a fever pitch. I saw up ahead what looked to be some sort of clearing that seemed to be where the sound was coming from. 

The whirling sound around me immediately dissipated as I stepped into the clearing. The light of the moon shone brightly here. In the center, surrounded by snow, was a large gnarled tree, wide as it was tall. It was silent now. I approached the tree slowly, my blood dripping in the snow. I could feel my consciousness begin to ebb but I tried to focus on what I came for. As I reached it I saw it was covered in blood. I knelt at the foot of it, tears flowing down my face. I knew this must be where she was taken.

I called out, sobbing, to whatever might be listening, “Please… please give her back.”

I heard the snow crunch behind me. 

Hope alighted in my chest, “Addi? Is that you?” I said before I turned towards the sound.

“D-dad?” Before me was my dad, he looked just how I remembered him. “What are you doing here?” 

“I heard you needed me!” He said warmly.

I was excited to see him but I desperately needed to find Addi. “Dad, something is wrong, Addi is missing. I think something took her.” I said frantically, beginning to search around the base of the tree.

“I know! I did.” He said again, in that same warm tone.

I was confused, “What? What are you-?”

“I took Addi! I took her away because you didn’t want her. You wanted me, your dad.”

I felt my stomach drop, his cheerful tone taking on a sinister air. I stopped what I was doing and looked closer at the thing that was claiming to be my dad. I could wisps of wood in his face.

“You’re not my dad… you’re that thing.” I said, fear beginning to rise in my throat, “What did you do with Addi?”

“I used her to bring you what you wanted!”

“I… I don’t want that. Bring her back!”

“I don’t think you understand… I *used* her to bring you what you wanted” It said, its voice dangerously low.

“You… what are you?” I managed to choke out through the burgeoning terror.

“I’m your dad.” It said flatly.

“You’re not my dad.”

“I’m the closest you can get, Josh. I’ve been watching for a while now, I couldn’t bring you your dad. I tried.” There was a hint of disgust in the way he said those last words.

“What?”

“I tried to bring you your dad, but he was dead.” It said, frowning, "He died in a car accident two weeks after you moved here.”

“You’re lying - my dad’s not dead!” I shouted.

“I can show you. I can show you what he looked like when I dug him out of that grave; sunk my hands into that stinking rotten flesh!”  It sneered as its form twisted into a grotesque version of my father caked with dirt and decay. “Is this the version of me you want?”

“Stop!” Panic began to course through my veins, “please, please stop it!” I began to whimper.

“What Josh? Don’t you want to see your dad?” It looked at me incredulously, “I did all this for you! Why don’t you love me?” It hissed.

“Stop! I hate you… I hate you, I hate you!” I screamed at the demon in front of me.

“Don’t talk to me like Addi! I’m for you! I was made for you!” It roared as it grabbed me and picked me up, bringing me close to its face.

“I want my sister back!” I shrieked, stabbing him with the knife. All I felt was hard wood beneath the blade. 

“Why do you hate me! Stop hurting me!”

“What about what Addi wanted?” I screamed. “Why did you take her instead of me?”

“She just wanted you to be happy, Josh. So, I gave her what she wanted by giving you what you wanted! Please stop hurting me!” it whined.

“I’m not hurting you! You’re not bleeding!” I exploded. I reached down and touched the gash in my leg and held it up to the Wood Demon, “This is blood. You’re nothing like me, or my dad, or Addi.”

“I can bleed!” It howled. “Is that what you want? I can bleed! I can bleed Josh! I can bleed!”

I passed out then from either the cold or maybe loss of blood. My mother found me in that clearing and brought me back home. She said that she found me next to a large tree with a wooden mannequin lying next to me in the snow. The police never found any part of Addi, but I know that that thing took her and killed her. We moved away from that house soon after. I never went back. I asked my mom about dad and she confirmed what the demon had told me. I’ve never gone back or asked questions. I’m telling you this so maybe you’ll be smarter.

If you ever hear singing in the woods, run.
