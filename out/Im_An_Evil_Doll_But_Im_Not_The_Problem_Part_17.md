If anyone didn’t see last week’s update

“This is going to hurt kid, but it’ll be quick. “ Mike says, holding the glass in my eye with a small pair of silver pliers. 

In case it wasn’t obvious, it’s Alex. Punch wanted me to talk to you guys this time. I’d go into why (beyond the fact he just needed a break.), but that’d spoil what happens. 

“Shouldn’t be too bad, not many nerves in the eye. “ Leo says. 

Mike sighs. 

“You think I don’t know that? Do I look like the kind of person who hasn’t stabbed an eyeball or two? 

I was trying to make the kid feel like a badass. “ Mike replies. 

And, they’re right. As he slowly pulls the sliver of glass out, there’s not much pain.  Makes the feeling I have that everything is just a dream a little worse. 

Mike drops the glass into a cup of water, the look on his face doesn’t make me feel any better. 

“Can you see?” he asks, his tone tells me he already knows the answer. 

I close my good eye, I’m not blind, but the world is nothing more than washed out smudges. 

“Not really. I’ll be fine though, right? It’s not like it popped. “ I ask. 

“Eyes don’t really pop.” Leo explains. 

“Christ Leo, you ever been around a kid before?” Mike scolds. 

“If getting you to a hospital would fix it, I promise you, we would.” Sveta says, she gets to one knee so we can be face to face.

In two days I’ve been thrown from one house full of monsters and crazy people to another. I’ve seen murderers, ghouls, evil toys, my family killed. This piece of news wasn’t the worst thing that’s happened but it’s the straw that breaks the camel’s back. 

I cry, and for anyone judging me because I’m not some emotionless ass-kicker, I’m 11. With a wrist I’m pretty sure is broken, and too many other bad things happening to count. If you want an 11 year old that’s beating up demons, go watch anime. 

Half of my face feels like it’s on fire, but I can’t stop. Since everything started, I haven’t had time to really think about things. 

Sveta tries to comfort me, tell me things are going to be okay, but they aren’t, they just aren’t. I push her away nearly falling out of the chair I’m in. 

“Maybe we should take this upstairs, the freak show can’t be helping the kid. “ Leo says. 

“My name is Alex.” I say, trying to stop the tears and blood. 

“Hey Alex, would it help if I said that I’m scared too?” Mike asks. 

I snort at him. 

“I could show you.” The killer clown says. 

I don’t understand what he means. I look at him for an answer. 

“We should all debrief anyway. Kaz, Hyve, you joining us ?” Leo asks. 

They do, and we all walk into a kind of office, a large table sits in the center of the room. Lots of books, and binders on shelves. 

Hyve shuts the door, and as he does, something happens to Mike. 

He almost falls into one of the leather chairs, a blank, horrified look on his pale, painted face. 

He runs his hands over his head knocking his undersized tophat to the ground. 

“Mike, you okay?” Punch says, I liked his voice through my phone better, the one he’s using is boring. 

“Fuck no!” Mike almost screams. He fumbles through his long coat, pulling out something I recognize from my grandma’s place. One of those little plastic boxes for pills. 

He takes a couple from the small compartments and closes his eyes. 

“There are monsters god-damned everywhere. I’m working with three right now. 

How is this so blasé to all of you? “ Mike says, shuddering. 

“Mike, what’s going on here? “ Punch asks. 

Mike starts to laugh. No, calling it a laugh isn’t right, he starts to…giggle. He calms himself down after a minute or so. 

“It takes a half dozen psych meds to keep me at normal. I’m mind-fucked enough the voices in my head have delusions. And those delusions suffer from paranoia.

Knowing what’s  real, and what isn’t  was hard enough before the supernatural got thrown into the mix. Now, I don’t know. 

It’s an act, guys. I’m stumbling from one cosmic fuck-over to the next, losing a bit of myself each time. 

I see this kid, and I wonder if maybe I just stole her. Maybe I’m just sitting in some abandoned house, spewing nonsense before….” Mike starts to cry.  

“I felt like that when my brother started to lose it. More when the man in the attic came with the toys. “ I say. 

Mike looks to me, a sad half-smile on his face.  Makeup running. 

“You and me, Alex we aren’t like the rest of them. We’re just people. 

You know what that means?” Mike asks. 

“Not really.” I say, honestly. 

“That’s okay. Took me a long time to understand too. 

They’re here because this is their world. We’re here for a reason. 

Once we find out what that is, we can get out of this nightmare. 

I hope. “ Mike explains. 

He doesn’t seem relieved as he talks, more, serious. Like he’s just figuring things out himself. 

“ Not to be crass, but can we, rely, on you Michael?” Kaz, who looks like a combination of slenderman and an old candle, asks. 

“I think so.” Mike says, looking for something among the cabinets and drawers, he finds a small silver flask tucked in the back of a brown metal filing cabinet, drinking whatever’s inside in two swallows. 

“That’s reassuring.” Hyve says. 

“I’m being honest. There’s a chance the cheese slides right the hell off of my cracker.  It’s happened before. 

We’re not talking some kind of berserker rage either. Just a good  old fashioned mental breakdown. “ Mike seems to be calming down as he talks. 

“Won’t the police be coming?” I ask, trying to feel involved in the conversation. 

Leo starts to talk, Sveta interrupts him.

“Hon, I’m not going to let my friend explain things anymore.  

We can’t count on the police right now. But soon, we can get you to some family. I know this is a lot to take in, and we seem kind of scary, but none of us want to hurt you.”

I almost feel she’s lying a little. Like when an adult tells you a shot isn’t going to hurt, or medicine isn’t going to taste bad. But I know she cares, I don’t really know her, but it makes me feel, less alone. 

“We’ve got some time, hell night wouldn’t have been cheap for the Bishop. “ Leo adds. 

“The sniper said some things that had me thinking that what the Bishop is doing is, off the books. Any way we can use that?” Punch suggests. 

“Not that I can think of. Might have been prudent to take him a hostage instead of destroying him. ” Hyve says. 

The room is silent for a while. Nothing but my pain and the realization that life is never going to be the same to keep me occupied. 

“I was really hoping Hyve had a connection he could use. “ Kaz says, looking at me for a second. 

“Do you?” Hyve asks. 

“Not as such. “ Kaz replies. 

“Just drop the turd in the punchbowl man. “ Mike says. 

I laugh a little. 

“What a foul turn of phrase. 

The ‘turd’ is the fact that I may have a way of getting this information to the right people. 

I don’t know anyone in the Bishop’s organization, but there is one entity I know of that would have reason to try and gain favor with them. 

No friend of mine, he’s a terrible, egotistical thing. But useful to our cause, as long as he doesn’t know what he’s doing. “ Kaz says. 

“That’s what this situation needs, another demonic hanger-on. “ Leo adds. 

“Not as such. 

I didn’t mention him before, as none of us have the…prerequisites to contact him...” Kaz starts to explain. 

More silence.

“Hell no, I can see where this is going and, hard pass from me. “ Mike interrupts. 

I’m starting to get tired of being talked about. It’s worse when they think I’m not smart enough to understand that’s what they’re doing. 

“I’m with Mike” Sveta agrees. 

“No way we send the kid into danger. We give this a couple days, and get her a state over. “ Leo adds. 

“I’ll do it.” I say, surprising myself. 

“Sorry kid, informed consent and all that. “ Mike tells me. 

I think about cursing, swearing, telling them about how I am informed. How I understand I could get hurt, maybe even die. 

But I realize I’d just come across like a little kid. 

I look to Kaz, he scares me. Something like him can say it’s nice all day, but I’m not going to believe it. 

“What would I have to do?” I ask. 

He takes a while to start talking, I can almost feel the anger coming off of the other adults. 

“Children these days aren’t very familiar with rituals, how can I explain this?” He says, trying to think of an explanation. 

“Mr.  A lot of us have been combing through the internet for spooky things since we were in kindergarten. I don’t know how much is true, but I know what a ritual is. “ I say, proud that my voice only squeaked once. 

Mike smiles, Leo looks like he just swallowed a bug. 

“Sorry for assuming , Alex. I’ll explain things and you can decide. “ Kaz starts. 

Now if I put his explanation here, things would get repetitive pretty quickly. 

So, how about I start things off with a warning. 

What Kaz told me was called the “Nothing Left” ritual. And if the name didn’t make it obvious, it’s bad news. Don’t try it, if you find yourself in a situation to perform it, introducing the supernatural into your life will just make things worse. 

But I know people won’t listen, so I’ll try to give advice when I can. 

First, you have to be under 18, and lost all immediate family due to tragedy. You have to have access to your first childhood home, and the farther away from the tragedy, the bigger a chance for things to go wrong. 

What scares me the most about it is the fact that, conceivably, someone could fall into it without noticing. None of the steps are out of the realm of possibility. 

The next step is to look for a 24 hour grocery store. This needs to be done between 1 and 4 a.m. .  If you’re thinking ‘ My city doesn’t have one’ it does, if you look hard enough. 

At this point it’s already possible to fail, but honestly you’re lucky if you do. The worst that will happen is you never find the store. 

You want to have a minimum of 20 dollars in change. More is fine, but it makes things a little more complicated later. Smaller is best, pennies are what you want, ideally. 

My heart pounds as I walk into the place. At first, this early in, nothing seems that out of the ordinary for a grocery store at 2 a.m. That being said, I’ve never been in one this late so things seem spooky regardless. 

The kind of people in a grocery store at 2 a.m. scare me a bit. That’s before I start wondering how many of them are part of this. 

Obviously I didn’t , but if you have gotten this far, there’s still time to turn back. Once you feel someone behind you, having trouble breathing, it’s too late. 

I turn down the cereal isle and it’s nearly empty. But I feel it, him, behind me. 

The ritual has started. 

My heart starts to pound, I know what I’m looking for but there are a few more steps before I can get it. 

I can’t look at the thing behind me, Kaz made that very clear. But my mind starts to make a picture of what it looks like. 

At first I picture a mean looking old man. Being impatient and trying to get by. But as I walk, I can hear the odd product fall, or shelf rattle as we turn a corner, it makes me think whatever it is, it’s huge.

My brain starts to go to darker places, I try to calm down, focus on what I have to do next. 

“Where are your parents?” a voice from behind me asks. The angle it’s coming from is all wrong. 

You can answer the thing behind you, I didn’t, but do not look at it. 

You might think that the shelves around me would be filled with rotting vegetables, or body parts, or something, but it’s the exact opposite. Every product seems like it’s designed for me. Things I’ve never even heard of that I know I’d love.  

It’s this place trying to make me  screw up. Even though I know this, it’s so tempting. 

“You shouldn’t be here. “ The voice from behind me says. I don’t respond, but it feels like my heart is going to explode. 

Eventually you’ll come across a security guard, he’ll be old, 40’s or 50’s, and not very interested in doing his job. He’s not a monster, actually you might find this part pretty interesting. 

Kaz told me , and I quote , “ The supernatural likes to recycle.”, I’ll explain what he meant. 

We’ve all read a million creepypasta, that security guard is in one of the classic ‘ I’ve got a job with weird rules ‘ kind of situations. Which is a part of the ritual itself. 

At some point, you’re going to need to steal something. If you get caught, you’ll be fine, as I said, this is some down on his luck guy getting paid absurd money to follow strange rules. If he catches you though, whoever is reading his story shouldn’t be expecting a new episode. 

I walk down a spice isle that smells good enough to make me feel light headed. I’ve never stolen before, but I slide a bottle of a beautiful looking purple salt into my jacket. 

I look to the guard, he’s flipping through his phone. 

Or is he taking a picture of me? 

Against almost everyone’s advice I agreed to do this, I know I could die, but I don’t want to drag this poor guy into it. 

I look to him again, this time we make eye contact, I turn away, walking faster. 

“You filthy little thief. You play dangerous games little one. “ The voice behind me says, scaring me bad enough to make me stumble. 

I walk up and down isles, it’s almost hypnotizing, like being on a long car ride. I try to tune out the thing behind me, but it doesn’t work. It looms, threats and comments that make me feel like I need a shower coming from him non-stop. 

I get to a point where I know I’ve walked farther than should be possible. From the outside this place was a step above a corner store, but I’ve been walking for hours. 

Around me things start to get strange, make less sense. I swear I’ve seen some of these isle before, as a kid maybe. It has a dream-like feel to it, like everything here is a patchwork of places I’ve been before. 

The people start to seem different. Clothing that’s out of place, faces just a little off of how they should look. 

I want to run, to go screaming back to Punch and the rest and tell them I can’t do this. 

Having some monster force it’s way into my life, that’s one thing. But knowing I chose this, that’s a whole different kind of scary. 

But it’s way too late to turn back now. The entire place feels like it’s one thing, watching me, waiting for me to make the smallest mistake. 

The product names around me are pure nonsense, but somehow I still feel like I want them. Like I desperately need a box of  “Happiness flavored laundry detergent. “ in my life. 

I expected more blood and guts, the kind of brutal terror that has been my life for the past couple of months. But this place, it isn’t like that. I know it’s silly to say it feels worse, but it does. 

If you’re anything like me, you’ve read a story like this and felt you’d do pretty good. Might even seem fun. But I want to explain something. 

There’s a feeling, something you’ve never felt before. Something no terror or tragedy can match. It’s a sense of wrong, a sense of being some place that wasn’t meant for people. 

I pass rows of jars, pretty colors and filled with something floating in a  alight blue liquid. I start to run when one of the formless things within begins to turn toward me. 

A woman is on her knees in the middle of an isle, weeping. I almost ask her if she’s okay as I pass, but then I see her hands, fused to her face, one eye looking at me through cracked fingers. 

I’m getting tired, my feet hurt and the further I get the more things around me strain my mind. I start to think that maybe I missed a step along the way. Kaz wouldn’t tell me exactly what happens if I mess up other than ‘ it’s best not to think about it ‘ . 

If you’ve made it this far, what you are looking for is a rack of DVDs. It’ll be small, tucked toward the end of an isle, or near some other impulse buys. In my case it was in the middle of a freezer isle. 

Mist pours from open doors, noises from inside coolers make me pause on the way to the rack. You do not want to read the other films anymore than you have to. Some are nonsense, but others, they have things written on them you do not want to know. 

At this point you might be asking yourself, “Why would anyone want to do this?”. Other than the exact situation Punch and I find ourselves in that is. 

First, this is the kind of thing you could stumble into by accident. Likely how it was first found. But there are plenty of people who went in for a lot worse reasons that I have. 

This isn’t just some spooky thrill. The reward isn’t the fact you poked the bear and got away. If you do this right, you get one question answered. And to a lot of people, especially a lot of young people in vulnerable states, that’s worth it. 

The cover looks cheap, almost hand made. A bunch of fast food items with happy faces, one of which, something that might be a chicken nugget, holding a bible. 

‘Fayth Foodz’ is the title. I grab the thin box, starting to sweat, my eyes struggling to judge the distance to the till. 

“Pocketful of copper, trousers full of piss. These are your last steps Alex. 

And when you die here, you don’t get to move on. To be with those who went before you. Look around you, this is your eternal rest. “ The voice behind me says. 

Something damp and warm briefly touches my neck. I can feel tears start to fall, but I don’t make a noise. 

The thing manning the till is almost human, long vertical pits for eyes, a small thin mouth, it looks to me then the thing behind me.

The predatory expression on it’s face makes me shudder. 

The price tag says $19.99. I place the DVD on the counter and start the worst part of this ritual. 

If you brought any bills, you’ve messed up. Larger change can work, but the bigger the coin, the worse your chances. And when the consequences are something even someone like Kaz doesn’t want to talk about, that’s not a chance you want to take. 

This is why exact change in pennies is the best option. Assuming you can keep count that is. 

I’ve never counted to 2000 before, let alone with stakes like this. But slowly, but by bit, the massive bag of change gets put on the counter. 

Behind me a line starts to form. Impatience and anger radiate from the growing crowd. 

The voice behind me laughs, it distracts me. Not enough to make me lose count, or god-forbid look backwards, but I see the tinted windows of the store. 

I see the throng behind me, a milling mob of things trying to seem human. I’m glad I can’t make out detail in the disty reflective glass. 

Ten dollars counted, something screams an insult that is senseless and cutting at the same time, I’m dazed as something hits me in the back of the head. 

A can of ‘Synthetic water flavored animal oil’ rolls away, a small dent from where it struck me. 

I’m at 15.63 when me heart drops. 

A dime. 

My hands begin to shake, the thing behind me laughs, the anger from the crowd is palpable, they begin to press in behind me. I dare another look in the reflective window, there are at least 4 dozen creatures in the line. 

I reach $19.99 the events around me don’t make me feel confident I’ve kept count. Not to mention that evil little dime that snuck it’s way in. 

Sudden silence. Tension, fear. 

The thing behind the counter looks toward the mountain of pennies, holding the DVD with one hand. 

Something wet and flat, like a dirty washcloth starts to wrap around my neck. It begins to tighten, silence all around me as I begin to see spots. 

I struggle, but the hold is like steel. I cry, my damaged eye feeling like it is going to come out of my head. 

I wonder what step I messed up, what one of the handful of rules I broke. I try to cry, or scream, but no air can move. 

Skin tears as I wonder what it’s going to be like becoming part of this place. Dragging other people to this same death. 

I wake up to rain. 

I’m in the middle of a field face down in a deep, murky puddle. I cough, it feels like my throat is full of broken glass. There is a swollen red ring from my neck to my shoulders. 

Beside me is a dirty , white plastic bag. When I lift it I know what’s inside, but I look anyway. 

Fayth Foodz. 

Lightening lights up the field enough to give me some bears as to where I am. The crack of thunder that follows feels like it could knock me over. 

I begin to walk back to the house with Punch and the others. I want to feel excited, like I’ve accomplished something. But I don’t. 

Seeing that place, seeing how wrong and senseless the world can be, it makes me understand how bad my situation is. 

The fact that I’m only half way through this ritual, sucks away any sense of accomplishment I might have. 

The next step is to watch the DVD. I don’t know what exactly to expect, but if that twisted grocery store was the appetizer, I don’t know if I want to try the main course. 

If anyone has any help they can give me, let me know in the comments.

I hope I live long enough to keep you all updated. 

Alex.
