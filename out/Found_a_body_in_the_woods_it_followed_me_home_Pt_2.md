It’s been a few weeks since the hallway incident, my brother finally had to visit, nothing I could’ve done, it was fun, I tried my hardest to keep my cool in my own damn house. Fucking ridiculous I tell you, I’m scared of the one place I should feel safe in. I don’t got any pets or a wife. Hell I don’t even know if I have ever had a crush on someone, but back to the story.

After his visit I decided to do something about this ghost/possessed corpse problem, the days during the hotel I went to Walmart and bought a shit ton of Halloween candles (thought it fit the theme, and maybe it’s her favourite holiday?). Then some incense or whatever it’s called. And some salt just in case she ain’t friendly (pink hawaiian kind for some bedazzling, and because it came in a pack of 4). Then loaded up, payed my fee for the stay(s). And drastic measures, ouija board

And then I drove back, my heart beating like I ran a 20 mile marathon in the Sahara Desert. Sweat along with it, the steering wheel felt like I covered it in dish soap and water. Except without the bubbles, and it felt longer than the trip should but anyway, I’m stalling the real meat of this story. 

I got out and reach for my keys from the ignition, quickly searched for the house key. Walked up and opened the door for the second time. FYI this was before the visit. Put it all in the pantry because if I had it ready I would worry him with salt lines near door and random sage burners. 

Anyway once he left I waited till midnight, she hasn’t appeared even when I was alone for the few hours, swear I heard her but it was probably my mind, she didn’t make sound usually.

Then I went into my basement (stereotypical but it was the darkest room I had), brought my coffee table with me to put the candles on. Sat down towels so we could sit on our knees near the tables. And then put the candles on the table. And lit them.

Then I waited, nothing happened 

So I tried to make her known, and brought out the big guns, the board

So I said “Emily, if that is your name, point me to yes”

Nothing 

“Why are you haunting me?”

It moved, only slightly. I figured it a draft and then it happened 

In the corner, she gazed at me even without eyes. As you expect, I froze still on my knees. And the piece started moving. “Liar” 

“Liar? Who? Me?”

“Not found, Still alive”

“You? You’re still alive?”

“No”

I looked back into the corner, what I hate about her most, she doesn’t go away in the blink of an eye, she still sits there, until you look away.

I quickly ended the seance and threw all the shit away in the woods. Chained the basement shut. And continued life as normal. She never stopped appearing after that. It was just in the corner of my eye. I sign was always the tempature getting cold as hell. 

I eventually got tired of it, so I visited my brother. He looked pale as always. We played games like that new Forza, really fun. We ate out almost every day, Pizza Hut, Wendy’s, KFC, all of it. Watched his favorite movie since he was little, Starship Troopers. No clue why my father introduced him to that movie with all the boobs and butts in some scenes. But it’s a really good watch. Enough movie talk though.

He was doing better than before, happier. More talkative, less jumpy. I was the opposite

Now for my least favorite aspect of this visit. Sleeping, he had a guest bedroom in his house. Nice sheets, better than my actual bed. Anyway I was sleeping for the 3rd time at his house. Then I woke up at exactly 4:45am. Was thirsty so I reached for the coke I left unopened near my bed. And saw her. She can follow me, what if she follows him? Same look on her face, what remained of it. Her chest cavity still almost nonexistent. We looked at each other for a couple minutes, seconds? Hours?! I couldn’t tell at that point. All I remember is her suddenly turning on my light and then disappearing, like reached for the light. Pulled and gone. 

It’s the day after, still at his place, I can’t be safe anywhere from her. Emily, I’m going to help you. As long as I don’t die first. Please
