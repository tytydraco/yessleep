I applied to shovel horse shit out of desperation. Solstice University had an equestrian team and they kept a barn on campus. Through the Solstice website, I’d submitted my resume to a variety of jobs I knew I was underqualified for. I didn’t know anything about horses at all. I was an English major. My experience with animals extended to walking Rudy back home. 

Yet a few days after I applied, I received an email from Solstice’s stable director, Helen– *Hi Maeve, send me your schedule of availability so I can put you in the system.* I didn’t even need to interview. I figured it would be a straightforward job. For two hours every Sunday evening, I’d muck the stables. No customers, no uniform, no prior experience needed. The pay was $25 an hour, great for a menial job. It would earn me enough money to pay off repairs for my janky old sedan, which I named Gertie. 

It was a long walk to the barn, and my new boots squeaked the whole way. The sky was gray and heavy. When I got there, a barrel-chested dog came running out and started barking at me. I wasn’t intimidated– Rudy’s big as a bear– and I stuck out my hand so he could sniff me. “C’mere, Amos,” a voice called, and the dog lumbered inside. 

“Hey, how’s it going?” said a tall butch woman. She wore thick work gloves and coveralls, and was leading a brown horse to its stall. “You must be Maeve.”

“I’m alright,” I said, watching her take off the horse’s bridle. “Are you Helen?”

“That’s me, but you can call me Hel.” The stall door whined on its hinges as Hel closed it. “So, training!” She clapped her gloved hands together. “Got any experience working with horses?”

“No, actually. But I’m happy to learn.” 

“I’ll be honest with you– it’s hard work. Especially the evening shift. But you’ll get better with time.”

“What’s wrong with the evening shift?”

Hel paused, staring off into the distance. “It’s just different. Different responsibilities.” She opened up another stall. “This here is Walter. I’m gonna teach you how to muck his stall so you can get started right away.” 

Walter was pale white with grayish spots. He nickered softly when Hel ducked into his stall. “You’re gonna need a pitchfork and a wheelbarrow. All you do is sift the hay and look for the dirty stuff. When in doubt, toss it.” She scooped some soiled hay into a wheelbarrow to demonstrate. “If you need to move him, just give him a firm push. And never sneak around his backside or you’ll get kicked. You gotta let him know you’re there, like this.” Hel placed a hand on Walter’s hindquarters while she moved behind him. 

I nodded along, throwing in a cursory *mhm* or *got it* to show Hel I was listening. It looked easy enough and I was eager to try. 

“When your wheelbarrow is full, take it to the pile and dump it.” Hel pointed to a mound of hay outside, steaming in the cold. “Remember to refill the beds with fresh hay.”

She showed me where the hay bales were, and which ones were for eating and bedding. “Once you’re done mucking, you’re gonna feed and water the horses. There’s a whiteboard by the office that tells you what each horse eats. Walter and Hercules get alfalfa, and Duchess gets steamed hay. It’s very important to remember that. Messes with their stomachs if they get the wrong food.” 

Next Hel told me how to refill the water buckets. “Be sure to hook them on the right way. The horses can catch their eyelid if you don’t.” 

“This all seems doable,” I told her. “Can I try a stall now?”

Hel chuckled. “There’s a few more things you have to know before you start.”

“OK. What is it?” 

“Like I said, the evening shift is different. I need you to count the horses when you’re done. Make sure every stall has a horse. If anyone is missing, they’re probably outside. Let me know and I’ll bring them in.”

I glanced around the barn. There were eight stalls in all. A lot to muck, especially for a beginner. I was ready to get calluses on my hands. 

“And be careful around the woods.” Hel got that faraway look in her eyes again. “It gets dark here.”

Solstice University bordered a dense tangle of woods. I’d smoked there a few times, but I never went very deep. “Sounds like common sense,” I said.

Hel handed me her pitchfork. “Ready to start?”

“Ready.”

“If you need anything, come get me. I’ll be in the office.” 

I started with Walter's stall. When I stepped in, he started sniffing me. “My coat isn’t food,” I scolded him when he lipped my zipper. I spotted some shit in the corner and began scooping. Working next to Walter complicated things. I hesitated to push him around, worrying he’d bite or kick me. Luckily, he was docile and shuffled aside every time. My wheelbarrow quickly filled up. I took it to the pile, a few yards from the barn. The acrid smell stung my nostrils. Emptying the wheelbarrow took some effort. I couldn’t get out all the hay in one try, so I used my pitchfork for the rest.

Then I heard a noise from the distance. A low whistle, like blowing into something hollow. It sounded like it was coming from the woods. I wasn’t idiotic enough to go investigate it. I took the wheelbarrow back to the barn, ignoring the fear humming through me.

The next step was replacing the hay. With a pair of rusty scissors, I cut open the thick cords binding the bales together. I grabbed one flake, two flakes, and shook them vigorously around the stall, until I couldn’t see the bottom of the bed. 

After that, I had to feed Walter. He got two flakes of alfalfa, which scratched up my hands. Walter began chewing at it before I could even lay it down. “Whoa, be patient.” While he was occupied, I emptied his water. The buckets were heavy. I felt a twinge in my back as I carried them, and knew I’d be sore the next morning. I dumped them out on the pavement like Hel said. 

Again, the same whistle came from the woods. I could swear it sounded closer. Walter snorted loudly behind me. “It’s OK,” I tried soothing him. It was probably a wild animal, like a fox or coyote. A good reason to avoid the woods. 

I stepped back in the stall and saw the fresh hay was stained. Walter had pissed while I was gone. “Damn it, Walter. I just replaced that.” He was standing right against the wall. His ears were held back, and he looked tense. I went to the office to update Hel on my progress. 

“I finished Walter’s stall. What should I do next?”

Hel was standing at a whiteboard, drawing up a chart. “Just do Duchess for now. You’re still training. Once you get more experience, I’ll work you harder.”

Duchess was the brown horse I saw earlier. Her coat was short and sleek. “Hey, girl,” I greeted her. She had the same anxious stance as Walter, and her stall was even dirtier. Most of the hay was soaked with piss. I got to clearing it out. As I did, I thought about Gertie, her peeling paint plastered with dozens of bumper stickers. $25 an hour did seem ridiculous for mucking stalls, but with that kind of pay, I’d be able to diagnose the mysterious rattling sound she made whenever I drove too fast. Not to mention I could visit the salon and touch up my blue-streaked hair, which had faded to a seasick greenish hue. The thought motivated me to keep dutifully cleaning Duchess’s stall. I followed the routine of emptying my wheelbarrow. At the hay pile, I listened for the whistling noise, but didn’t hear it. The stables were quiet. No sound but the rustling of hay. 

The steamed hay was kept in a wheelbarrow on the other side of the barn. I went to grab a few flakes. Amos started growling behind me. “Manners,” Hel called from the office. He was sitting in the aisle, eyes fixated on something I couldn’t see. His tail was tucked between his legs. Probably some wild animal again, I decided. Rudy always fussed at the foxes out in the yard. 

I scattered the steamed hay, dumped Duchess’ water buckets, filled them with the hose. The stall looked luxurious for what it was. “I’m finished with Duchess too,” I told Hel.

“Great. Do the head count, and you’re good to go.”

I walked along the aisle, making sure there was a horse in each stall. Walter, Duchess, Hercules, Luna, Barnaby, Captain, Bonnie, Gandalf. Eight horses, every stall occupied. 

Amos started growling again. His throaty rumbles turned into barks. Around me, the horses whinnied, sharply blowing out air. Walter banged on the door with his hoof like he was trying to break out. Duchess was shrieking. I looked around to see what was disturbing them. 

Outside, there was another horse. 

It stumbled like a newborn foal as it aimlessly circled the pasture. Its legs seemed too thin and too long for its body. I could see the outline of every rib. The whites of its eyes were visible from every angle. They looked almost human. I thought I heard it faintly whinnying, but as I listened closer, it sounded more like whistling. 

“Maeve!” Hel shouted. Suddenly she was pulling me away from the pasture, gripping my arm so hard it hurt. “Fuck,” she swore under her breath. “I should have told you.”

“Told me what?” My heart thudded in my chest. 

“You counted the horses, right?”

“Yeah, they’re all in their stalls.” 

“We only have eight.” Hel said breathlessly. 

A cold feeling stirred through me. Goosebumps budded all over my body. 

Hel hustled me into the office and locked the door. It had three bolts and chains. Amos sat at her feet, whining constantly. “It should be fine, if the stalls are locked. Did you lock them?”

“Yes, I did.” The horses kept crying outside. 

“Good. We can’t lose another one.”

I didn’t dare ask Hel what she meant. 

I walked to the barn next Sunday with my new boots caked with mud. That evening I mucked three stalls– Walter, Duchess, and Hercules. Walter and Hercules got their alfalfa, and Duchess got her steamed hay. I learned that Amos liked being scratched behind his ears. Lifting the water buckets felt a little easier than before. I made sure all the horses were locked in their stalls, checked and double checked. And when it got dark, I never once looked out at the pasture.
