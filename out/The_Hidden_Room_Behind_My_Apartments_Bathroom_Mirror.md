Hey everyone, I don’t even know if I can sleep tonight after what happened. This is my first time posting here, and I hope sharing this will help me make sense of it all. I swear, every word of this is true.

I live in a small apartment building, the kind that’s old enough to have mysterious creaks and drafty corners. It’s usually quiet, but recently, I noticed something odd about my bathroom mirror. It was a basic, rectangular mirror, but it started to look different. The silver backing seemed to have faded, and there were strange marks on it that I couldn’t explain.

One night, after a few too many beers, I decided to clean the mirror thoroughly. As I scrubbed away, I noticed the mirror was slightly loose, and I could see some of the wall behind it. I gave it a push, and to my surprise, it slid back with an eerie groan, revealing a hidden compartment behind it.

At first, I thought it was just an old storage space that the previous tenant had used. The compartment was small, barely big enough for a person to fit into, but it was filled with old, dusty items. I pulled out a few things—a stack of yellowed papers, an old key, and a small, leather-bound journal. The journal had a lock on it, but the key fit perfectly.

The first few pages of the journal were mundane, detailing someone’s day-to-day life from decades ago. But then it took a darker turn. The entries became increasingly disturbed, describing the writer’s obsession with a “creature in the walls” and their growing desperation to escape it. The last few pages were scrawled in a frantic, almost illegible handwriting, mentioning something about a “gateway” and “never-ending darkness.”

I laughed it off as some weird prank from a past tenant, but that night, things started to get weird. I began hearing faint, rhythmic tapping from inside the walls. It wasn’t constant, just sporadic enough to make me uneasy. I tried to ignore it, but the tapping grew louder and more insistent over the following days.

Then, the whispers started. They were soft, barely audible, but always there—murmuring from inside the walls. I couldn’t make out the words, but the tone was unmistakable: desperate, pleading, and angry. I was losing sleep and my nerves were frayed, but I told myself it was just the stress getting to me.

Last night, things took a turn for the worse. I woke up to a cold draft in my room, even though all the windows were shut tight. The whispers had turned into loud, guttural growls, and the tapping was now a relentless pounding. It felt like something was trying to get out.

I was terrified, but I had to know what was causing this. I grabbed a flashlight and pried the mirror off the wall again, revealing the hidden space. This time, though, there was something new. The compartment was no longer empty. A gaping hole had appeared in the back wall, and I could see into a dark, claustrophobic space beyond.

I shone the flashlight into the hole, and my blood ran cold. There were scratch marks everywhere, on the walls and floor, as if someone—or something—had been desperately trying to claw its way out. The darkness beyond seemed to pulse and writhe, as if alive.

The worst part? I saw something moving in that darkness. It was vague and shifting, but there was no doubt it was something—something that should not be there. I felt an overwhelming sense of dread, like I was peering into a place that was never meant to be seen.

I fled the apartment, leaving my door wide open. I stayed with a friend last night and haven’t gone back. I don’t know what’s in that hidden room or what’s been trying to break free, but I do know that whatever it is, it’s not good.

I’ve tried contacting the building management, but they’ve been unhelpful and dismissive. They claim there’s nothing behind that wall, but I know what I saw. I don’t know if the thing in the dark is still there, but I’m not going back to find out.

If you live in an old apartment or house, check your mirrors. You might find something you wish you’d never seen. And if you hear scratching or whispering from the walls, don’t ignore it. Some things are better left buried in the darkness.
