I recently bought a house—a spacious, 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom duplex. It’s an old farmhouse-style home, complete with a barn in the backyard and a few acres of land. Beyond my property lies nothing but farmland stretching as far as the eye can see.

After purchasing the house, I realized the attached unit was in horrible condition—falling apart and looking like something out of a horror movie. If you walk through my backyard and find an opening in what feels like the jungle of my neighbor’s property, you’ll come across a faint path leading down to their house. This is where things took a darker turn, and I began to regret my decision to buy this place.

The entry doors had broken windows and a rotted-out frame, while vines and trees overtook the windows and grew into the ceiling. Inside, it was as if time had frozen around 2010 or earlier. Old flip phones, bulky gray laptops, and huge box TVs sat alongside outdated floral furniture. Everything felt abandoned, left behind.

The ceilings had collapsed in several places. The ceiling fans drooped down like wilted flowers, and every cabinet and drawer was still filled with food and dishes, now covered in animal feces. Boxes were chewed open by mice or rats. Moving to the next room, I found three doorways: one to the basement, one to the hallway leading upstairs, and one to the living room.

What I found in the living room was shocking—piled high to the ceiling were bottles and bottles of Johnson’s baby lotion, alongside stacks of old porn VHS tapes and DVDs. The room was cluttered with food containers, empty drink cans, bottles, and jugs, making it feel even more disturbing.

The hallway wasn’t much better. It was overrun by an entire colony of spiders and webs, so thick they seemed almost cartoonish. Just walking through it made me feel itchy, as if the spiders were crawling all over me even after I left.

Then there was the basement.

This is where things went from bad to terrifying. The entire basement was lined with cages—small ones for rodents, and larger ones for cats and dogs. They were filled with shredded paper, old food, and water. There were no animals or carcasses, but there were easily 10 to 15 cages of varying sizes. A couple of dog crates were even found in the living room.

As I made my way upstairs, the staircase was lined with gallon jugs of water, all the way to the top. Once I reached the second floor, I found several bedrooms, each as disturbing as the next.

The first room I entered was an oddly long closet—nothing particularly unusual there. However, the next room seemed like it had once been a child’s bedroom. It had multicolored fan blades and kiddie wallpaper, but it was no child’s room anymore. On the bed were four cardboard boxes, the kind used for raising baby chicks. They were still filled with bedding, water, and food, and disconnected heat lamps had been placed inside the boxes. A dresser in the room held an old TV and a DVD player, along with more stacks of pornography and bottles of baby lotion.

But it was the next bedroom that horrified me the most. From the doorway, I could see leaves and vines creeping into the room. Sunlight poured through a massive hole in the roof, filling the air with a rancid smell. The roof had collapsed onto the bed, and underneath the hole was a tarp covering a large 55-gallon drum. It seemed as though someone had been living there despite the damage. The rest of the house was scattered with old milk jugs and iced tea containers, likely filled with water collected from the hole in the ceiling.

What do I do? Who do I call? Can anyone help me? I love my home but I feel so overwhelmed with a feeling of regret. Why wouldn’t my inspector have notified me of this? How could the sellers not tell me about the horrors next door. Where is the man who owned the home? 


After speaking to the township I’ve found that he’s still alive , paying his mortgage and taxes. The man has multiple warrants out for him for code violations and snow removal tickets. The police can’t find him, private investigators can’t find him. Nobody knows who he is or where he is.  I have collected some small bits of evidence As his name, his old company, the name of the woman who lived in the house and died in the house in 2015. I’ve found old family photos, and a EMT notice posted on the refrigerator. 

Should I just leave it alone ? 
Should I keep digging ?

Let me know what yall think please I could take any advice at the moment.
