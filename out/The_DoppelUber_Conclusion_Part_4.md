Soupy descriptions from fathers seeing their child for the first time were *de rigueur,* so you’ll kindly excuse me mine. My daughters looked like wet aliens. As I peered through the glass into the NICU, It wasn’t just that I loved them with every vibrating molecule. There was a gravity to them that would never allow me to leave their orbit for the rest of my life. Each new dad in the maternity wing of St. Brendan’s Memorial Hospital felt he was the luckiest man on earth, but I knew it was me. I’d come too far.

As my eye muscles loosened, I caught sight of my reflection in the glass. White bandages with tufts of hair sticking out. Dried blood soaking through underneath my eyes. I was a ghoul. My exterior finally matched my interior.

I escaped outside for fresh air alongside smoking surgeons. One of them—the one with the menthols—was a lung transplant surgeon. Sing about that, Alanis. We watched the tow truck drag away my totaled vehicle.

“Poor bastard,” Dr. Menthol exhaled.

“No way he made it outta that,” another added.

In a way, they were right. But then I noticed something else – the windshield in front of the passenger seat was fully intact. *Didn’t the Doppelganger fly through the window?*

We spent a week recuperating. I’d say we did it together, but Emma made it clear I had work to do before she’d trust me again. I’d have judged her if she didn’t. Emma and I stood at hospital reception as the woman tallied the astronomical charges of an uninsured mother giving premature birth to twins while her casually suicidal-man child husband occupied a hospital bed for a week. I had already emptied Ted’s Uber balance into my bank account, but a fleck in the ocean of what was surely owed. The receptionist’s keys clacked away, each stroke dashing hopes of financial stability. She punched a final key with a flourish that made me hate her children. She furrowed her brow. Maybe her screen wasn’t wide enough to display the number. Maybe she didn’t know the proper terminology for a number with four commas. Either way, the 16% chance of both of my daughters surviving birth at twenty-four weeks had panned out, and I was okay with anything else after.

“It’s been covered,” she said, surely in jest.

Doing our best impression of our newborn twins, Emma and I grunted together, “Huh?”

“There’s no balance. It’s been paid.”

I just couldn’t help myself. I called Dr. Lukavic. He answered and I asked,  “When you ran the paternity test, did you test both of my daughters?”

“Why would we do that?”

“To make sure they’re mine.”

“We only test one. If one’s yours, they both are.” There was a long pause. “Are you okay, James—”

“Who are you talking to?” Emma said wheeling in. I stuffed the phone into my pocket and turned to my girls napping in her lap. Emma could tell I was up to something but didn’t pursue. She didn’t ask questions she didn’t want the answers to. We waited curbside for the ride home arranged by hospital  transport.

An UberXL.

I helped Emma into the vehicle and settled our daughters into their child seats. It seemed impossible that such a cacophony of straps and buckles could come together in a configuration beneficial to our babies’ safety, but with an unexpected *click*, they did. An apt metaphor for parenthood, I suppose. We would make it work. I settled in next to Emma and looked back at our daughters. In that moment, I remember being furious with myself for thinking everything was going to be okay. Complacency makes the devil’s work easy.

“Quickest route or fewest turns?” a graveled voice inquired from the front seat.

My heart sank. My palms sweat. When I met the black eyes of the driver in the rearview, I knew it had to be him. The Doppel. Fucking. Gang—

When the driver spun around, I was never more relieved to see a Korean man in my life.

I breathed a sigh of relief, “Fewest turns. Don’t wanna wake the babies.”

I reached out to Emma, and she accepted my hand. We were embarking on the most uncertain journey of all, and I’d never felt more certainty in my life. I watched my daughters share the unconflicted dreamless sleep of newborns, and I was happy. I even tried to shake off the half-smile parting the lips of my second-born daughter.

“You okay?” Emma asked.

“Perfect.” I knew she saw my eyelids flutter, but she didn’t follow up. I should’ve learned to not ask questions I didn’t want answers to. But I did anyway. As the car rolled forward, my gaze rose to my reflection in the rearview mirror.

And there I was, looking back with black eyes, a half-smile at my lips.

I was finally in control.
