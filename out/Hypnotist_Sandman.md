They called him The Sandman.

Not because he put people to sleep  though he could do that with frightening ease  but because of what his victims reported seeing in their final moments of consciousness: endless deserts of black sand stretching out under a blood-red sky. None of them lasted more than three sessions. After that, their minds simply... disappeared.

I found him through a desperate Google search at 3 AM, after my fourth straight night without sleep. The website looked professional enough: "Dr. James Morrison, PhD. Sleep Specialist and Clinical Hypnotherapist." His rates were suspiciously low, but insomnia makes you do stupid things. Makes you take risks you'd normally avoid.

The office was in one of those old Victorian houses converted into medical spaces, all dark wood and creaking floors. The waiting room smelled of lavender and something else, something metallic that reminded me of old pennies. I was his last appointment of the day.

Dr. Morrison didn't match his website photo. Where the image showed a grey-haired man in his sixties, the person who greeted me couldn't have been older than forty. His eyes were strange too â€“ so dark they seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. But by then, I was too tired to care about such discrepancies.

"Insomnia can be a doorway," he said, gesturing for me to sit in a high-backed leather chair. His voice had an odd quality, like multiple people speaking in perfect unison. "A doorway to parts of the mind we usually keep locked away. Tell me, Ms. Walker, what do you see when you can't sleep?"

I told him about the shadows that moved when they shouldn't, about the whispers that sounded like my name but weren't quite right, about the feeling that something was sitting on my chest every night, getting heavier and heavier.

He nodded as if this was all perfectly normal. "The mind creates such interesting defenses against the truth. Shall we see what's really keeping you awake?"

I remember the pendulum â€“ a black stone on a silver chain. I remember how it seemed to leave trails in the air as it swung, like tear tracks in reality itself. I remember his voice getting deeper, resonating in my bones.

"Focus on the pendulum, Ms. Walker. Let everything else fade away. There's only the pendulum and my voice. Only the darkness and the desert that waits beyond..."

The next thing I knew, I was standing in an endless expanse of black sand. The air smelled like burning copper, and the sky... God, that sky. It wasn't just red â€“ it was alive, pulsing like an exposed organ, dripping something that sizzled when it hit the sand.

Dr. Morrison stood beside me, but he wasn't Dr. Morrison anymore. His skin had become transparent, showing not organs and bones, but endless depths of swirling darkness. When he smiled, his teeth were made of that same black sand.

"Welcome to where the mind goes when it can't bear reality anymore," he said, his voice now a chorus of thousands. "Welcome to where thoughts go to die."

Other figures began emerging from the sand â€“ men and women in various states of dissolution, their bodies partially transformed into that same black granular substance. Some still looked mostly human. Others were just vaguely humanoid shapes made of swirling darkness.

"My other patients," he explained. "Or what's left of them. The insomnia wasn't keeping you awake, Ms. Walker. Your mind was. It knew what was coming. It knew you'd eventually find me. They always do."

I tried to run, but the sand pulled at my feet. Looking down, I saw my legs were already beginning to crumble, turning into more of that black sand. The transformation wasn't painful â€“ it felt like falling asleep, appropriately enough.

"Don't fight it," the thing that had been Dr. Morrison said. "Everyone needs to sleep eventually. Everyone needs to join the desert."

I woke up screaming in his office. According to the clock, only an hour had passed. Dr. Morrison â€“ the normal, human-looking version â€“ smiled professionally and handed me an appointment card for the following week.

"Same time next Thursday?" he asked, as if he hadn't just revealed himself as some kind of dimensional horror.

I wanted to run. Wanted to never see him again. But when I opened my mouth to refuse, what came out was: "Yes, thank you, Doctor. Next Thursday would be perfect."

That was three sessions ago. I can feel the desert under my skin now, shifting and churning. When I look in the mirror, my eyes are starting to darken, to show depths that shouldn't exist. Sometimes I catch myself trailing black sand wherever I walk, though no one else seems to notice.

Today is my fourth session. I can hear the desert calling, the voices of all his other patients singing to me through the veil of reality. Soon I'll join them. Soon I'll finally sleep.

But first, I needed to write this down. To warn others. If you're suffering from insomnia, if you're desperate enough to try anything, and you find a website for Dr. James Morrison... close it immediately. No matter how tired you are, no matter how much you need to sleep.

Because in his desert of black sand, no one ever wakes up.

The next screen shows his business card, but the text keeps shifting, the letters crawling like insects:

```
Dr. James Morrison, PhD
Sleep Specialist & Clinical Hypnotherapist
"Let me help you find eternal rest"

By appointment only
[ADDRESS REDACTED]
[The phone number appears to be different every time you look at it]
```

I have my final session in an hour. Already I can feel the sand in my veins, replacing my blood cell by cell. My fingers leave black granules on the keyboard as I type this.

If you're reading this, it's too late for me. But maybe you can still save yourself. Whatever you do, don't look for The Sandman. Don't let him into your mind.

And if you start seeing black sand in your dreams... run.

THE DESERT CALLS

[End report. The author was never seen again. Investigators found only a pile of black sand in the chair where she had been sitting, and all attempts to locate Dr. Morrison or his office have failed. The building where his practice was located shows no record of ever having housed a hypnotherapist, though local residents report occasionally seeing lights in the windows at night, and hearing what sounds like thousands of voices whispering in unison.]

*Note: Multiple readers have reported finding traces of black sand near their computers after reading this account. Others claim to have received automated email responses from Dr. Morrison's office, offering discounted rates for first-time patients. All such emails have been traced to servers that don't exist.*
