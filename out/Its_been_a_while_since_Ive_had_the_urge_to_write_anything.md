Going through school, writing used to be the only way I could really express myself. I never really caught on with drawing or music, sitting around and piling up drafts of things I’d never release just always seemed like the best way to unwind.

But of course, the stress of growing up, keeping track of bills, performance reviews, car maintenance, all of the little things adding up, I fell out of practice. One day, I realized I just didn’t have the spark I needed to put words to paper anymore.

That bothered me, of course, but when I sat down and tried to convince myself just to write a rough paragraph, just to get back into it, the only things that came to mind were how I could “spend my time better” or “do something that’d help me get ahead”, as if my creativity was a hindrance, and nourishing it was self-sabotage.

That was, until one day, scrolling through reels and shorts, I saw an ad for one of the first consumer-grade behavioral implants. The ad said it was a quick process, and because it was still in its infancy, the whole procedure would be cheap and include plenty of communication with the developers. I was obviously skeptical, so after a minute of checking out the website, I decided against it and returned to my doomscrolling, lamenting over how many things got in the way of my self-expression.

A week later, I lost my job. There was a company-wide financial audit, and my entire department was deemed “redundant and not conducive to meeting shareholder profit margins”. I was offered a small severance package, about enough to cover my bills for two months, and then I was sitting in my car, my desk packed into the backseat, with no idea where to go from there. That’s when I decided I was going to do it.

The website had sent one of those automatic emails to me after I had signed up to look at the website, so I replied and set up an appointment. It only took a few days to have the paperwork submitted and filed, and before I knew it, I was sitting in a waiting room that was five degrees too cold, the smell of iodine and cheap air freshener filling my nostrils.

The process was quick and painless - according to them it only took about an hour (I asked to be put out, even though they said it wasn’t necessary), and I responded incredibly well to the implant. There was a quick rundown of what it could do, how to adjust my feelings and mood from the app, and the number to call in case something goes wrong. They had set me to a default of high-attentiveness and retention, so I understood perfectly well and was practically an expert by the time I finished their pamphlet. Simply put, I had 100% of my mind to allot to different aspects of my personality. Creativity, emotional stability, attentiveness, et cetera. Easy enough to understand, especially with it all condensed into a user-friendly app.

The drive home was incredible; it was like I was seeing the world for the first time. I realized my town had ten different coffee shops within three miles from each other, I noticed the patterns in the medians where city planners had decided how many bushes would best fit in a 5’x10’ strip, and I noticed that my town had two libraries, of all things (I’ll be stopping by the closest one later.) I pulled over and adjusted my focus ever-so-slightly to creativity, and the colors of the flowers and trees seemed to be brand-new hues that I had never even known existed. Even cars and pedestrians seemed to be entirely new entities, like blood cells keeping the body of the city alive.

After I got home, I did my laundry, meal-prepped lunch for a few days, and watered my plants, all the things that always seemed like insurmountable tasks by themselves, let alone all at once. Finally, I saw it. My notebook, the same one I had bought myself 10 years ago, one of my many attempts to push myself back into the saddle. I sat down, relaxed, and words started flowing without any effort whatsoever. The spark was finally back, and I was able to relive the joy of putting pen to paper again. I gave myself a little more creative juice, and analogies started coming to me as simply as breathing, finding it almost trivial to draw connections between almost entirely unrelated events. I kept writing and pouring my feelings out onto the page like I had never spoken a true word before, and I had finally found it within myself to speak freely to a loved one.

A little bit more, and I could practically feel the words, they were so real I could see them taking form in front of my eyes, every word that I wrote was made real twice over. Once in the act of giving it life by writing, and again when it presented itself anew to me, the words themselves being reborn in my mind as if they were the next line in a book I couldn’t put down, one that I would stay up late into the night reading for the scandalous luxury of just one more page. I took a short break, tidying up around the house a little more to celebrate my rekindled passion, and give my writing the clean and comfortable surroundings they deserve.

A little more, and it dawned on me that I had wasted so much time, so much effort, trying to give myself a life where all I needed to worry about was making it to work on time, and then all of my woes would be handled, so I could focus on what truly mattered, expressing myself. I had put my personality aside and snubbed the spark of my soul in an errant attempt to give myself near unattainable security and stability. Why had I done this, what goal was I attempting to achieve before I allowed myself the supposed luxury of enjoying myself? Wracking my mind, I’m met with only half-truths and compromises, perhaps I’m just not thinking creatively enough. I stepped away for a moment; I was getting stuck in my own head. I cleaned a bit and re-folded my clothes, I had practically shoved them into my dresser earlier.

Getting back into it, a little bit more won’t hurt, I’m sure. 65% has allowed me to see the outside world with a newfound beauty and respect, who’s to say 80% won’t give me the ability to do the same with myself?

I think I get it. I wasn’t good enough, that’s why I stopped. Everyone else seemed so much better, so much more natural. Writing always made me feel like a child wearing their father’s suit. I wasn’t one of the good writers, but I was playing pretend and acting like I was creating masterpieces up until it came down to showing anyone. Not anymore, I’m making a name for myself. I lost my job, I’m likely to lose my car and apartment, but I’m finally ready. Seeing the magic and beauty of my own writing acting itself out before my eyes has finally convinced me that I have a story worth sharing. I’m committing myself to my passion. I’m devoting myself to my creativity, and I’ll strike out against the endless tides of visionaries, hoping to leave a mark somewhere they can see it.

 

Just one more draft, it’s almost perfect.

 

It's been a while since I’ve had the urge to write anything.
