Her locket is small, slippery; a thin chain like sewing thread and a clasp for nimble, patient fingers. I could never hope to open any part of it now. My hands shake. I scrub. Delicate little filigree—an anatomical heart—gold and copper and *blood*. 

Inside, there is a picture of her—Mae—opposite a picture of us, all smiling, all happy. All alive. 

For a while I thought I had survivor’s guilt. I read about it, searching for someone else’s tidy words for how I felt. PTSD with one measure of empathy and another of overthinking. A vestige of the Holocaust originally. ‘I should’ve’ and ‘why didn’t I’ at their most insidious. But I don’t feel guilty—not really.  I feel lonely and I feel afraid. I *still* feel afraid. 

I did blame myself for what happened at one point. I’d been drinking—*a lot*. Maybe if I hadn’t been, I would’ve noticed something, taken the signs more seriously. But I guess we had all been drinking. We felt safe. Three friends camping. Normal. 

Mae was supposed to move to Philly for a job that you couldn’t stop her from smiling about. She was proud, excited, finally a bona fide adult at twenty-eight. Peter and I were happy for her—we were—and our weekend was supposed to be a last hoorah. But she was leaving and our trio was going to be different; less fun and spontaneous, more grown up. 

Peter’s wife Corinne was pregnant so that would have forced a change too, but they had been trying for a while, so Mae and I had gotten used to the idea of being a spiritual aunt and uncle. Peter’s baby would eventually learn to make cocktails and we’d invite the little thing into our group as an apprentice. 

Corinne wasn’t thrilled when I planned aloud. But eventually she’d laugh despite herself. Peter laughed more. Infectiously. Big thunderous, husky laugh that could shake the shadows from the corners of a room and make you wonder how you had ever felt shitty in the first place. 

Fuck, I miss that. I need that. 

He had one of those laughs the first night as Mae frowned indignantly and I smiled over one of several whiskeys. He had brought a Tupperware of something he called Cherokee Stew for dinner. Mae was giving him a woke earful about appropriation and Peter had made a joke about possibly being part Cherokee. They fought like friends—a stupid circular argument, goading, but drinking all the while. 

Eventually Peter said that Mae didn’t have to eat it. She could have trail mix or granola bars. 

“Oh, I’m gonna eat it, because unlike your pasty Anglo-Saxon ass, I *am* part Cherokee!”  

Silence. 

I laughed first. Then Peter, then all of us, then—

“Whoa.  What the hell was that?” Peter’s eyes lost their crinkle. 

We all heard it. A shriek in the darkness, piercing, desperate. 

“I don’t know. It sounded like a…” I second guessed myself, not wanting to ruin the mood. But Mae was happy to oblige. 

“*A woman*. Should we—what do we do?”

We waited a moment. Listened. Nothing but the chirp of crickets and the crackle of logs. 

“Maybe it’s just kids,” Peter offered, solemn and hopeful. “She—whatever it was—it didn’t say ‘help’, right?”

Mae was tense, searching the air with her ear the way a deer might. “Yeah, but would someone really scream ‘help’?  Or would they just scream?”

“Well, we don’t really even know if it was a someone, do we?  I mean, we could call the cops, but…“ Mae seemed to turn my suggestion over in her mind. 

“No—no, you’re right. They wouldn’t do anything anyway. It did sound a lot like a woman though, didn’t it?”

Peter and I shared a discussion in a glance. 

*It did.*

*It totally did.  But she’s alright…right?*

*Yes. Absolutely. Maybe she got tickled or something?*

*Corinne shrieks when she gets tickled…*

*See? Could be anything. It’s fine.*

*Yeah. Right.,.*

“Look, Mae, if we hear it again, we’ll—I don’t know—go look or something, but for now, I don’t hear anything. Do you?”

I tried to be diplomatic. But it was late—dark—and we were drunk and comfortable by the fire. Mae nodded, shook it off, chuckled uneasily. 

“More bourbon for your nerves, milady?” Peter shook the bottle. 

“Uh, yeah. Thanks, Pete.” 

We didn’t hear a thing after that. Just mental echoes of a scream. A short scream, a long one, painful, joyous. An hour later we were eating s’mores, playing drinking games and the scream had become a dozen different vaguely plausible memories. By midnight, we were all in our tents, in our sleeping bags, separate rooms and the quiet cacophony of an uncertain wilderness. 

A rustle of leaves, the groan of a maple tree, the thrum of my drunken pulse, footsteps, the synthetic squeak of my sleeping bag, a cleared throat, a snore, a distant scream. Another. A bad dream, a fearful nothing. Then sleep. 

—

The next day came cool and gray with Peter humming along to a Bluetooth speaker and Mae clutching a cup of coffee, pretty and bundled and drawn. 

“How’d you sleep?” I croaked at her. 

“Uhh. Good, just hungover.”  She smiled meekly and eclipsed her face behind her mug. 

“Yeah. I’m with you,” I commiserated. “Hair of the dog?”

Mae declined, rubbed sleep from her heavy eyes. Peter, annoyingly chipper, lifted a bottle and eyed it flirtatiously against the low morning light. 

“Hell, I’ll join you, Jack. Little Irish coffee—er, *Kentucky*—sounds like a grand way to start the day.”

Peter must’ve slept well. He had the enviable habit of turning a gut full of liquor into a head full of energy. He had been that way at 25, and at 30, he hadn’t changed. He was just rounder around the belly, and decidedly more bearded. 

Mae and I sulked miserably in contrast, slouching and moaning over our headaches as Peter merrily sang bluegrass in a terrible falsetto. He was cooking sausages and scrambled eggs in a cast iron skillet. Being a dad for us misanthropic kids. He had always been that too—our gregarious anchor. Warm and happy. 

Mae was conscientious and a bit of a bitch, though I say that as lovingly as I can. Without her, Peter and I would have devolved into sloppy, self-indulgent men long ago. Insufferable and perhaps more free, but less happy. It was Mae that badgered Peter into first talking to Corinne as he pined pitifully across a crowded bar. She was loving in a brutal sort of way, and she wasn’t shy about being blunt. 

“I gotta piss, you lousy perverts keep your eyes on the fire,” she said, standing. 

“Maybelline (not her name), I’m a married man,” Peter answered, full of false indignation. “I‘ve seen more woman peeing than I could ever need. Or want.”

She chuckled and turned to me, narrowing her eyes, accusatory.

“Don’t kink shame me, Mae.  It’s triggering. You’re better than that.”  I smirked. 

She seethed.  Then we laughed and she disappeared, grumbling theatrically. A moment later, I filled Peter’s melodic calm with what seemed like a neurosis. 

“Hey Peter, this is gonna sound crazy, but after we turned in last night—“

“I heard it too, man.” He said, turning the sausages. “I called the ranger station before you and Mae woke up. No one missing, but they said they’d keep an eye out.”

He was staring then, no longer smiling—pensive. It made me feel oddly settled. And then I thought 

“You’re gonna be a good dad, Peter.”

“Yep. I know.” He sipped at his cup. “I’ve been watching Bluey—this Australian cartoon about dogs. Been taking notes.”  

He never showed a hint of trepidation about becoming a father. No doubts. He had things figured out. And now, I hoped that we could give Mae some peace of mind when she got back. I was sure that she had heard the screams. Her face said as much. But when she returned to camp, she looked frantic. She tore open our bag of food, started rummaging. 

“Where are the marshmallows?”

“Snack attack. I like it.”

“No—Peter—where are they? Did one of you finish them last night?”

I shrugged. Peter shook his head. Mae looked pale. 

“What is it?” I asked. “What’s wrong?” 

“You’ll have to see.  Come.”

She grabbed my arm. I followed, stumbled through brush and stopped at a nearby clearing. I saw what she was raving about—marshmallows scattered across the ground, crawling with ants. Gross, I guessed, but not worth the worry. There was something else. The screams maybe, but something more too. 

“I think they’re ours,” Mae whispered. 

“Okay. So we’ve got a raccoon problem. We’ll be more careful. It’s not a big—“

“Jack, they’re *arranged*. I mean, am I crazy?” 

I didn’t get that at first, but when she said it, I saw it. They were laid out like stick figures—kinda. Maybe not. 

“Hey, if this is about those screams last night, Peter called the ranger station. They said that no one’s gone missing. No one’s reported anything. It was probably just kids fucking around, so why are you so—”

“There’s three stick figures. Three *people*. Like us. And it’s not just the screams—okay, well, maybe it is, but now this—“

“Mae, it’s nothing. They look a little like people but, I think you’re seeing shapes in the clouds. There’s probably little raccoon teeth marks on them or something. Look.”

I grabbed a stick from the ground, skewered one of the swarming white globs, lifted it…and the rest lifted with it. One of the people. The stick figure sagged, the marshmallows settled, and I saw a string running through them. Ruddy red twine—an armature. 

“Jack, what the fuck.”

I dropped it. “I don’t know.”

“Someone did that—made these. Came into our camp last night and—why? What does it mean?”

“I don’t know. Nothing? Peter said hikers come through this area occasionally. Maybe one of them decided to play a prank? I don’t know.”

As unsettled as we might have been, Peter was nonplussed by the news. He said that someone might have pilfered our camp. That it was odd, but not unheard of. That they were gone now. Obnoxious, but someone’s harmless fun. 

“After Blair Witch, everyone became an amateur horror set designer. They spooked you. Mission accomplished. But if it makes you feel any better, Mae, the greatest threats to you out here aren’t people. They’re falls, dehydration, Lyme disease. Hell, you’re actually a lot more likely to be killed at home than you are in the woods.”

Mae nodded thinly. I made her a stiff coffee and she accepted my offer this time. We ate. Planned our day. Enough distraction to catch a laugh or two. Then we packed bags and doused the fire. 

Mae conceded that she might have been overreacting; the stress of moving, she confessed. The uncertainty of a new life in a new place was all beginning to boil over. We did our best to reassure, said nice things, made promises. By the end, she was smiling and teary and Peter had moved our discussion to our quarry for the day. 

Peter’s uncle owned the land where we had set up camp—a hundred or so acres of low mountain wilderness with a working tree farm at its eastern edge. Pretty, rugged country that Peter had been roaming since he was a kid.

We’d been before to camp, but never to a place he mysteriously called ‘Xanadu.’  It was a special place—a hot spring, technically sitting on National Park land, but close enough to feel like ours. An autumn oasis in the woods. Hard to find. Not on the maps. He made it sound like a slice of bliss and Mae and I were primed to think with anything but misplaced fear. 

Before long, we were excited, we had a purpose, an adventure, and an hour later we found ourselves at the base of a sloping climb. One overgrown switchback slithering upward through skinny pines. 

We were so enthralled by everything; the energy, the wilds that dripped with austere beauty, that we almost missed him sitting there amongst the shrubs. A boy who blended into the gray and brown, still and dressed in a uniform that might have belonged to a boy scout troop. Something normal enough to forgive the oddity of his presence. He was young—maybe ten years old (or twelve? I’ve never been great at guessing ages). And he was ratty, dusted in dirt, alone and almost smiling. 

Peter became immediately paternal. He bombarded the kid with questions. *Was he okay? How did he get there? Did he need help? Food? Water? Where were his parents?*

The boy was…strange. Ragged and aloof, answering Peter’s questions only exactly as they were asked. *He was okay. He walked there. He didn’t need help. Or food. Or water. His father was up the mountain. His mother was in the ground*. 

He said it just like that—“momma’s in the ground.”  It was unsettlingly matter-of-fact coming from a child, no sorrow or happy pretense about heaven—flat. Peter brushed it off. Kept interrogating. 

“Do you wanna come with us?”

“No.”

“Why’d your old man leave you here?”

“Um. To talk to the Park Ranger.”

“And the Ranger’s up the mountain?” 

“Yes.”

“Maybe it’s about the scream,” Mae cut in. 

Fuck. We had gotten past that. And I didn’t want to—

“Yes.”

The boy lifted a backpack from his feet and clutched it to his chest. 

“So you heard it, too? Do you know what happened?” Mae seemed more curious than overwrought, a small improvement. 

The boy opened his mouth. Paused. “I have charms. Do you wanna buy one?”  

Unexpected. *Charms*?

Mae screwed up her face, confused. She was certainly not alone in that, but I didn’t want more worry, so I tried to steal back some of Peter’s morning positivity. 

“Sure,” I responded. “How much?”

The boy smiled. *Five dollars*. I had the cash. Why not? Suddenly he seemed excited, talkative. The charms were really talismans, he explained; they were magic, he made them to protect himself from bad things, sometimes they worked, now he made them for everyone, everyone deserved protection, his momma taught him how to make them, but she didn’t have one when she—

He stopped. Snatched away my money, reached into his bag. 

*Charms, Talismans*—A rodent skull, a couple of ribs and a few glittery plastic beads, all joined together with a shabby little macrame lanyard, made of ruddy, red twine. 

“Hey, kid…” I started. “I don’t mean to—“

“I’ve gotta go,” he interrupted. “Not supposed to talk to strangers. I forgot. Don’t tell my daddy, okay?”

Peter was frowning, eying the kid, concerned. Mae still looked confused. 

“Yeah. Sure thing,” I said, uneasy. “But you’re sure you’re alright?”

His nose had started running. He wiped it with his hand, painting dirt across his face. “Yes. I have merit badges. Always prepared. Always okay. Don’t tell though, if you see him. I’ll get in trouble.”

He smiled awkwardly, stood and shouldered his backpack. Started walking away. 

We let him go, even as a mental argument raged on Peter’s face and I kicked myself for not asking about the marshmallow effigies. It was only afterward that I mentioned the color of the twine, the similarity. 

Mae swallowed whatever nascent misgivings she had, turned to resolve instead. “Fuck it. Weird kid. I don’t know. Can we just go to this Xanadu place?” 

Peter nodded grimly. He led the way, up the mountain and to a pool nestled in a bowl of bald rock and gold leafed birches. The water steamed, ghostly and inviting and all of the morning seemed soothed away by the warmth of it. We sat in silence for a while, Mae close to me as Peter reclined opposite us. 

“Funny,” he said finally. 

“Hmm? What is?” I asked. 

“Nothing. I just wonder why you two never…you know.”

I looked at Mae who caught my eye and flicked her vision back to Peter. 

“Aww. You shipping us?” She asked, blushing despite her sarcasm. 

“You look good together is all.”

“Peter’s congratulating himself for picking attractive friends,” I quipped. 

“Well, I didn’t hang out with you two because you’re nice.”

Mae splashed Peter. He laughed, ducked beneath the water. Mae shrieked as he got one of her feet. Kicked at Peter. Chirped for help. Laughed. I grabbed her to keep her from going under. Felt the pretty warmth of her. Goddamnit, Peter. 

When he surfaced, he was laughing more. And then he stopped. 

“Oh...Hi.”

Mae and I turned around and saw a pair of boots, drab khaki trousers, a green jacket embroidered with a badge. 

“Sorry, didn’t mean to bother you.”  His jacket said R. BROOKS across the chest. The Park Ranger that the boy’s father was talking with, I guessed. 

He was youngish, clean shaven, pleasant smile playing across his face. 

“Something wrong, officer? Because look, I’ve been coming to this spring since I was a kid and I’ve never—“

“No. You’re fine.” He stared down at Peter, loomed above us. “I’m looking for someone.”

“A Boy Scout? Because we saw him not long ago.”

“A Boy Scout…hmm…maybe.”  

Peter rose from the water. Grabbed a towel. Waved Mae and I down as we began to rise with him. “I think I can show you where we saw him from the overlook,” Peter offered. The ranger’s smile never wavered. His expression didn’t change. He just said, “okay.”  

A moment later, Mae leaned toward me. Whispered, “I didn’t hear that guy walk up.”

“Maybe he’s a ghost.”

“Pfff. You’d think they’d let him retire at least.”

“Eh. Unfinished business.  Can’t ask for better job security.”

Mae chuckled. Then after a while said, “Hey. What Peter said…”

“He’s an idiot.”

“Hopeless romantic.”

“He owns a copy of the Notebook in hardback, you know?”

She grinned. “He borrow it from you?”

“I’d never give away my copy.”

Mae was close. Very close. Brown eyes, wet hair. 

“He *is* an idiot.”

“Uh huh.”

Whatever I might’ve wanted in that moment, it didn’t happen. Peter came back. Mae pulled her legs off of mine, gave Peter a *don’t start* kind of look. Peter shrugged. 

“So…I asked about the screams last night.”

“And?”

“He said it was foxes.”

“Foxes?” Mae asked. 

“Yep. Apparently they scream. Like women. Google seemed to agree.  Super weird, I know, but yeah.”

I watched Mae’s brow unknit. “Oh. Weird. Okay. And the kid?”

“I dunno. The ranger didn’t talk to anyone on the way up. No dad. But he’s with search and rescue apparently and they don’t have a missing kid on their radar. Pretty sure they would.” Peter chuckled. “Guy told me some crazy stories about the job though.”

Peter promised to regale us around the campfire later on. And an hour or two later, we were on our way back to camp. Feeling lighter. Singing. Joking. Laughing as the sun sunk low and cast our final mile in long shadows. Mae was the first to see the camp. 

“Oh, what the fuck!”

All of our things, coolers, bags and boxes, pans and plastic cups—everything but the tents—were all arranged in a circle around a gray-brown lump on the ground. I shined a flashlight as Mae reached down for the lump. Then she yelped. 

“Guh! Fucking maggots! Fuck!”

It was a dead raccoon—an old, deflated mass of matted fur, hollow eye sockets, a muzzle cleaned to the bone. 

“If this was that weird fucking kid…” Mae grumbled. 

She was livid, seething, tearing around our camp and searching. We checked for missing things. Nothing gone as best we could tell. A bit of strangeness made somehow expected weighed against everything else. Once the raccoon was buried, out of sight, Mae began drinking in earnest. 

Peter lit a joint and I cooked hotdogs on skewers as a shared silence began to fill. We fought against the unease, tried to joke about it. Then as night settled Peter made good on his promise to tell us about the Ranger’s stories. He was clearly having fun with it, adding little embellishments, pausing dramatically. 

A doormat at the edge of a cliff with a single pair of empty boots, an abandoned school bus where every seat was covered in what looked like human bite marks, a missing couple’s camera showing their last few days alive.

“Okay. That one seems tragic, but creepy?”  Mae was getting into the stories. 

“It wasn’t creepy. Until Ranger Brooks starts noticing something in the photos. Two eyes in the distance. A figure among the trees. There were four days of pictures in that camera. And in almost every one, a mountain lion hiding in the background. They didn’t notice. Search and rescue never found the bodies.”

“Well, fuck that!” Mae shouted. “Nope. Nope. Nope.”  

Peter turned in early in the night. Told us to look through our photos, just in case.  He smirked. Mae threw something. And then we were alone. Drinking. Playing truth or dare and feeling the conspiratorial pull of a possibly bad decision. 

“Jack. Your turn.”

“Truth.”

“Wimp... Okay. Let’s see. Earlier today, when Peter said—well—about us. What was your first thought?”

I watched her watching me. Close. Her truth was a dare, wasn’t it?  I leaned into her, made a possibly bad decision. One I could blame on the whiskey. One that she reciprocated. And then, for a moment, we weren’t friends. We were whispering in my tent, taking off clothes, trying and failing to be quiet as we erased the day with something that felt inevitable. 

Afterwards we lay, cramped enough to still feel intimate; a tangle of limbs, soft and affectionate. I kissed along her chest, stopped at the locket I had given her for Christmas years before. Something delicate that looked like something brutalistic from a distance. Like her. The sound of our breaths, the wind outside the tent, the crickets, the snap of a twig, an uneasy silence and a dozen little thoughts to fill it. 

The stories were getting to me, I reckoned. Crowding out the notion that I had just had sex with a friend with something less complicated—a touch of fear, growing. But we were alone, safe, and as I reached for the tent zipper, Mae reached for me and asked what I was doing. 

“It’s nothing. Paranoid. I just need to—“

I unzipped the door. Opened the flap. Gasped. Mae screamed and scrambled for fabric to cover herself. I backpedaled away from the door. 

The boy stared. 

“What the fuck! What are you—get out of our camp!”  

He was inches away from my tent, crouched and leering. Unmoving. Silent. 

“Kid, fucking leave! Jesus.”

His eyes moved from me to Mae. He inhaled a long breath, spoke. 

“Now I lay me down to sleep.” Breath. “I pray the Lord my soul to keep.”

I heard the zipper of Peter’s tent. Mae was shouting.  Swearing. I was paralyzed. Watching the boy’s lips wordlessly mouth, *if I should die before I wake. I pray the—*

He stopped. Eyes went wide. And he screamed. 

Peter came running. The boy was faster as he darted off into the woods. Mae shook. Hugged her arms around me as I tried to grasp for one normal thought. 

“Ho—okay.” Peter, flashlight in hand, shielding his eyes from two naked friends. “Trying not to look. But guys, what the hell was that thing?”  

I searched for clothes in the shadows, reliving the moment of the boy’s scream. Not scared or angry—alarming, shrill, a feral shriek. “The-the kid—“ I stammered. “He was right outside my tent.”

“That was the *kid*? The Boy Scout?” Peter barked, incredulous. “I thought it was an animal.  He—um—he ran away on all fours. Jesus.”

I was glad I hadn’t seen that, but the image still crept into my mind. The boy ambling away, wild limbs bent in the wrong places. Peter searched the woods tentatively as I tried to convince Mae (and myself) that the boy was harmless. He was just a kid. Weird, but not threatening. 

Peter lent me his knife after we settled down, a security blanket I wondered if I could ever bring myself to actually use. He said he’d call the Ranger’s Station again in the morning. Mae slept with me in my one person tent. Uncomfortable. Lovely. Warm. Whimpering in her sleep as I tried to slow my thoughts. Eventually, I must have slowed them enough to drift off. 

—

I awoke in the morning alone in my tent. Peter was talking to someone in an officious tone outside. 

“Well, take your time then I guess. Thanks.”  A pause. “Unbe-fucking-lievable.”

When I joined them, Mae half smiled at me. Better than avoiding eye contact, something I had fretted over on top of everything else. 

“What’s going on?” I asked groggily. 

Peter huffed and unscrewed the cap of a fresh bottle of whiskey. “Auto shop wanted 500 extra to come out here on short notice. 500!  What the hell is happening to the world?”

“The auto shop?” 

Mae sighed. “The truck won’t start.  Probably that kid. I was wanting to get out of dodge, but…”

“Yeah? What about the kid? The ranger station?”

“They didn’t pick up.” Peter responded, abandoning the pretense of boozy coffee. He pulled straight from the bottle and Mae beckoned for him to share. “Anyway. Nothing weird this morning apart from the truck.”  

“Good. I guess. And Peter, last night…”

His scowl thawed into a mischievous grin. “Last night…”

“Oh for fuck’s sake.” Mae cut in, shaking off the chill of the liquor. “He obviously knows we weren’t having a naked hang, Jack. We fucked, Peter. And I—am going to choose not to feel weird about it. I’m gonna drink. Jack—we’re not gonna fuck again. Unless we do. In which case, *you* aren’t gonna let me feel weird about it. Either of you.”

“Modern woman,” Peter answered, amused. “I dig it.  But Jack—and I say this as a friend—you are an absolute slut. And…I’m shaming you.”

“Fuck off.”  I laughed. 

“Shame. Shaaame.”

I turned to Mae, feeling more okay. “You’re not gonna defend me?”  

“No. I agree with Peter. Shaaame!”

It didn’t get weird. It got easy. And somehow, the day became…normal. We played cards. We drank. We made up stories about the boy. Clearly he was raised by wolves. Stolen from some Boy Scout troop and left to learn wolf culture and woodland handicrafts. Mae suggested that the glittery plastic beads on his charm-talisman-thing were part of an even greater mystery. 

“You know, Lisa Frank went missing in these woods a while back. No one found her. They assumed it was a photogenic mountain lion. But the mountain lion lawyered up. Maintained his innocence. Never had enough to charge him.”

She spoke with absolute conviction. Peter tried to look somber. 

I smiled. “Lisa Frank? The unicorn notebook company?”

“She was more than her products, Jack.”  Mae said, deadpan, flirting with condescension. 

Peter drizzled a bit of bourbon on the ground.  “Thug heaven is always so greedy.”

Lisa Frank. *Thug heaven*. We fucking lost it. 

We laughed more and more, cackling maniac laughter that felt so easy. Mae kissed me as Peter left us for a moment. Giddy and effortless, lips like a memory. Then she looked at me as if searching for an exit door in my mind, quizzical and earnest. I gave her my contented vacancy in return. 

Afterwards we didn’t talk about her leaving, didn’t talk about feelings, we reveled, made all of our misgivings into something ephemeral and endlessly unimportant. 

The day dragged comfortably. The branches sagged overhead, drowsy and nearly bare, leaves falling, ticking disjointed seconds away. At one point Peter called Corinne. We howled at her, to her; a pack of drunken idiots waiting for the normal world outside our camp to return. Peter didn’t tell her much. She seemed happy. And then dusk fell, and a hundred shadows reached from distant trees. 

That evening, we tried to make up ghost stories around the campfire, doubling down on our effort to control our smothered unease. The fear of the stories was ours. Something narrative and expected. Grim and grizzly, but still lighter than the unknowable dark mustering beyond the firelight. 

I got up to pee once. Staggered out, clumsy and babbling to myself. I must’ve put down my cup, though I don’t remember. I remember the sloshing jerk of the trees around me. I remember thinking of my two friends. I drank more. Started to feel wrong. My body hummed, drooping and sickly, receding into the gravity of my chair. 

“Jack, you okay?”  

“Huh? No—yeah, I’ve just gotta lie down for a bit.”

I was in my tent, fumbling with the zipper, cold, shivering, sinking into the ground. I heard laughter. Peter’s warm bellow, then nothing—a cold tent painted in silence. The firelight was gone and my sleeping bag was hungry, digesting me as mountain lions prowled outside and the tent breathed a languorous rhythm. 

“Jack—is that you?”

Whispered, distant, phantom words. A dream. A shriek. A muffled sound. The hush of leaves. “Somebody! Plea—“ The groan of heavy, naked limbs. An echoed laugh. A scream, guttural, wet. A quickened pulse, thumping, pounding. The rhythmic slap of flesh. Another scream. Another. Another. The whine of a zipper. Nothing. Then everything again and again until the sounds became meaningless. 

—

I awoke the next morning to barbaric light and a splitting headache. And silence. 

I waited, burying my dream from the night before. Trying to. 

*It was foxes again*, I told myself. *Drunken, screaming fox dreams. That’s all*. 

I went to Mae’s tent first. Called her name. Unzipped her door. 

Empty. She wasn’t there. She’d gone for a hike, gone for kindling, gone to breathe the mountain air, the scent of pine and moss. She’d be right back.

When Peter didn’t answer either, I felt relieved. It meant that they were together. I had been foolish. Drunk and anxious. Nothing more. I unzipped Peter’s tent. I hadn’t noticed his boots sitting side by side, tucked underneath his rain fly. But I felt the vertigo, an illusory cliff. I’d fooled myself into seeing a doormat and looked no further. 

“Peter…PETER!”

My voice carried, echoed off the tree trunks and died in a whimper. Peter was there, pale skin swimming in blood. Too much blood. His belly was ragged, a dozen clotted punctures—a hundred—too many. His eyes were open, staring as if lost in a thought I couldn’t fathom. The screams had been real. Not foxes; a friend dying badly as I spun drunkenly into sleep. And that meant—

*Mae*.

She wasn’t there. Hers was the first voice I remembered as the silence of the night became something horrific. 

*“Jack—is that you?”*

I felt sick. Where was she? Was she afraid? Dead? Worse? I had no way to know. Only a multitude of half certainties. Vague images of anguish hidden amidst the voyeuristic pines. 

—

It took hours to hike to the nearest Ranger Station. Quiet time to think ruefully and see her face in every distant clearing. A Ranger named Jansen told me that they hadn’t received a call from Peter. Not after the first night and not after the second. 

I told her about the kid. About Ranger Brooks. Every detail that I could remember. 

“Brooks? There’s no Brooks that works in the park.”

I tried to remember his face. I couldn’t. It blended indistinctly with something plausible but far from firm. Even now I search my memory for that face. Nothing. 

The following day, I was told that the likely motivation for Peter’s death was money. His wallet was missing. So was mine.

“I’ll admit, it is strange that that’s all they took.”  Jansen’s boss said those words so easily. It was Jansen who recognized the pain in my eyes and returned it with sympathy. ‘That’s all they took.’  Mae was still missing, a hole in me that grew with each passing day. 

And I was the one who told Corinne about Peter. I told her over the phone and listened to her break after the disbelief bled out of her. She loved Peter. And Peter was going to be a good dad. A perfect dad. I wanted to see that so badly. But as Corinne wept and asked her questions, all I could tell her was ‘I don’t know.’

Why would they kill him?

I don’t know. 

Did he make someone mad? 

I don’t know. 

Who did it? 

I don’t know. 

Why did they let you go?

I—

That question bothered me for a long time. Why did they let me go?  I wasn’t special. I wasn’t pure. I was chosen. After describing my recollection of that night to the Rangers, they sent me to the hospital for a drug screen. By then, my blood alcohol was zero. I tested positive for Cannabis as I knew I would. But I also tested positive for ketamine. I had wandered into the woods alone. I must’ve put down my cup to pee. And then I felt wrong. It meant that someone was there. Inches from me. Silent. Hiding. Waiting. Predatory. And I had felt safe. 

A month later Corinne gave birth to a healthy baby girl. A fatherless girl with Peter’s easy smile. By then, my persistent calls to the Ranger Station were met with faltering patience and thin courtesy. They were still looking. Mae’s parents would be their first call. I would be their second. 

But I never got that call. It’s been fourteen months. This Christmas, like my last one, felt hollow without them. I visited Corinne and Vivian a few days ago. I gave Viv a plushie—the dad from Bluey. I didn’t know it would make Corinne cry, but Viv chewed on its nose and for a moment everything felt normal. And then, last night I had a moment of hope. 

There was a plain envelope in my mailbox with ‘Jack’ written in big block letters across the front. A part of me saw Mae’s handwriting there. 

**JACK**

My stomach bounded. I opened it quickly, savagely and found two things inside. A thumb drive. And a locket. 

The thumb drive was filled with files, videos, and as I played the first, I was transported. 

“Oh come on. You’re gonna love it. It’s called Cherokee Stew.”

“Oh. So it’s a Cherokee recipe?”

“Uh. It could be. I mean it’s got venison and corn. *Maize* I guess.”

“What the fuck, Pete? You can’t call something Cherokee Stew because it has fucking deer meat and corn in it.”

“What’s wrong with that? It’s a good name. And it’s delicious.”

Mae. Peter. Me. From a distance. 

There were dozens of videos like it. The ghostly grayscale of night vision, the clarity of day through a telephoto lense. Two nights of oblivious us in the myopic comfort of our campfire’s light. We were safe. We always were wrong. 

I watched them all. One-by-one. At night as we slept, they would creep out from the woods and sit around the ashes of our fire. They moved our things, drank our water, ate our food and listened to us sleep. They never spoke—the boy and the camera man—but they worked with chilling, silent purpose. 

Then I got to the video of *that* night.  Mae didn’t scream at first. She thought they were me and why wouldn’t she?  They came with duct tape and coarse rope. Left her to wait as they made their way to Peter. 

I still can’t answer Corinne’s questions. I don’t know why they killed him. I wish I could unknow how. 

That video ended with me, still as a corpse, whimpering quietly in some hallucinatory nightmare. I might have screamed if I knew what they had done to Mae before they came to me. They watched me as her distant muffled screams mingled with their breaths. And I don’t know why. I don’t know where they took her. What they did after. I see her constantly because I need to hope, but I don’t know if she’s alive or dead. I know nothing. Or, I *knew* nothing. 

As I waited for the police to come for the thumb drive, as I began writing this, hoping that someone might offer some reason for any of it, as I moronically began to clean her locket to purge something horrible from something sweet, I looked at that envelope again. 

In my foolish hope, I had seen Mae’s hand in ambiguity. She knew my address. It made sense. And then the theft of my wallet made sense. They didn’t want money; they wanted me.  And I don’t know [why](https://www.reddit.com/r/decogent/comments/v85m4g/you_found_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).
