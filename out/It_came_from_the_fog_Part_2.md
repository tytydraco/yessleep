I have been locked in this car for 4 hours now, by my own choice. It's past midnight now, and I'm pretty sure adrenaline is the only thing keeping me awake right now. I keep hearing voices, whispers, coming from the fog. I don't know if I'm going crazy, but I really don't feel like testing that theory right now. I was hungry, I was parched, but I was scared. The only thing I brought to the car was my colt, foolishly, I didn't think id be in here long. 



I looked through my neighbours window, and I swear, I saw eyes looking back at me. It gave me the same feeling I had on the country road. I didn't want to start making assumptions, but I think it followed me home, whatever it was.



I knew I couldn't stay here. I tried to reason with myself, if this … thing … was going to hurt me, surely it would have by now, right?  I doubt that a seven year old Toyota was its weakness. It probably wanted me to stay in the car, driving myself crazy. This is when I realised, how much of a coward I was. Day by day, I lived my life being cocky and confident, but now that I needed that fake courage, I was a coward. As much as I wanted to sit here and self-actualise, I needed to get to the house. It probably wasn't any safer than the car, but at the time, it felt like it would be, and that was good enough for me.



One hand was gripping the car door handle, the other gripping my dad's colt, I took some deep breaths, bracing myself. It was simple, I could get from my driveway, to the porch, and into my house in 15 seconds. It was 15 seconds too long, in my opinion, but I needed to grow some balls for once.



Mustering up the courage, I click the handle, pushing the door open just enough for me to get out. I make a break for the house, I hear whistles behind me, at a low pitch no human should be able to make, some in the distance, some sounding so close that I could feel the vibrations on my neck. I didn't look behind me, I didn't wanna see whatever ungodly being was in that fog, I had a feeling if I did, id end up looking just like my neighbour and his dog.



I made it to my front door, it was already open a crack. I had no time to do my usual routine of slowly pushing it open. Not losing any momentum, I slammed into the thick wooden door with my shoulder, it flung open, and I fell to the floor, expecting more resistance. I hurriedly got back up, trying to shut it, praying for the sound of the lock clicking shut. Eventually, my prayer was granted. 



I stood still, pressed against the door for a few minutes. I knew it was locked, but, well, I don't really know why I was still there, I wasn't exactly in a stable frame of mind. Paranoia doesn't exactly go hand in hand with decision making. 



Once I realised that I was 'safe', I decided now would be a good time to pool my resources. I knew id be alone for a few days. The only other person that lived in this house was my sister, and she was staying at her friends house straight from school for the weekend, so I knew she was safe. I hoped at least, I didn't want to consider that this was happening elsewhere. 



8 Bottles of water, 2 cans of soda, 5 cereal bars, Yesterdays pizza leftovers, Tinned vegetables, A pack of instant ramen. A colt 1911 and a healthy handful of ammo for it



It wasn't much, and in my defence, I was supposed to get groceries tomorrow. It was enough to last me for a few days if I rationed correctly, but I hoped it wouldn't come to that. I started to wonder why I still even carried the gun. I haven't even seen a physical figure to aim at, not like id have the composure to hit the target if I did see anything.



Sat on the couch, I flicked through the channels on the TV, nothing but static. Whatever was outside was messing with the signal, as well as my mind. 



I looked out of the window, peering behind the cheap curtains. The fog was thicker now, I couldn't see past my porch now. My car was no longer visible. The whistles continued, each one feeling closer, but none topping the one I heard on my sprint to the door, the security of the house didn't go unnoticed to me. I continued to stare out of the window. Occasionally, I thought I saw a figure deep in the mist. My rational side hoped that it was just my cynical mind playing tricks on me, I remember learning in school that your brain can do that, not that any sort of conventional science could explain this... thing. The vengeful side of me hoped that I was seeing something, I craved to see something physical to pin the death of my neighbour and my own mental suffering onto. 



My staring session was cut short when I heard a crash from behind me, it sounded like glass. Everything in this room looked fine at first glance, so I presumed that it came from the kitchen. A million possibilities ran through my mind, did it smash the window? did it get in the house? what the hell even is 'it'? I grabbed my gun, carrying it like someone out of a cheesy cop show, I flung open the door from the living room to the kitchen, my eyes darting to the window. I breathed half a sigh of relief, the window was still intact. Dirty, but intact. My momentary bliss was over when I realised what the source of the noise was. The fridge was slightly ajar, just enough for the inside light to be turned on, illuminating the otherwise dark room. my eyes worked their way down to the floor, the weird red drink that I tried earlier had smashed onto the tile floor, sending shards of glass everywhere, whilst that was inconvenient, that wasn't what made my heart sink. The red liquid, which I now presumed was blood, wasn't in a pool on the floor like it should be. It had been meticulously formed into shapes. The more I squinted, I started to realise, the blood hadn't just formed random abstract patters, it made letters, words, even.



After careful analysis, I just about managed to make out the words "it needs to feed" 



This made me sick to my stomach. I collapsed onto the cold kitchen floor, with little care about cushioning my fall. I had never felt more lost. I would of broken down into tears if I still had the energy. I hadn't slept properly for over 24 hours at this point.



At first, I thought it was just playing some sort of sick game with me. I had been hoping that it would get bored, lose interest maybe.

Any hope I had previously had been stomped on and shattered. It was playing with me, it was hunting me. My neighbour served as good of an example as any of what happens when the fog gets needs to feed.



I sat there for what must have been 15 minutes, just staring at the ceiling, wondering what it will feel like. When it takes my blood, will I still be alive? Or will it have enough sympathy to make it quick. Is sympathy even a word in this predator's vocabulary? This continued for a while, starting to spiral into a depressive madness.



Eventually, I stood up, looking out of the window, I swear, I locked eyes with whatever was out there, I couldn't see anything, but I knew it was looking back at me



I defy you, stars



The fog was a faint red now, but I wasn't scared, not anymore. I was dead either way.



I looked out of the window. My adrenaline was running low, but I still had enough.

I was gonna go out on my own terms, I wasn't gonna sit, rotting in this house for any longer, whilst that thing watched, mocking me with it's whistles.



I was going to open that front door, and I was going to run, until either my legs gave up, or the thing in the fog did. Deep down, I knew which would cave first.



I chugged a can of soda for its caffeine, and headed towards the front door. My hands were trembling, my heart was pounding so fast that it felt as though the house shook with every beat. It made me light headed, my own fear was getting in the way, like it had done at every other stage of my life. I couldn't even grab the door handle properly. I didn't want to admit it, but in what was supposed to be my final noble act, I still felt like a coward.



That was my final thought before I blacked out.



I must have been unconscious for about 8 hours, my body was catching up on some much needed sleep. I was eventually awoken by an unexpected, but welcomed noise.

Birds were singing outside. I woke up, quickly getting to my feet. Once I got over the initial light-headedness, I headed to the window, peering behind the curtains, I saw a beautiful blue sky, and the even more beautiful Nevada sun. 



Had the fog finally lifted? Hell, was any of it real to begin with? 



I stumbled to the kitchen, still a little sore from sleeping on the floor last night. The smashed glass was still in the same place, but the blood was just pooled up. No words, no cryptic messages. 



I saw my phone on the kitchen table, I instantly grabbed it. I was on low battery, but that was good enough for me.



I had one notification,  it was from my sister, sent at 2am



"Hey, just letting you know that ill be coming back earlier than expected, something came up with Rachel, its a family emergency."



I dropped my phone, instantly sprinting upstairs, I was praying that id see her tucked into her bed, annoyed with me for barging in so early.



That is not what I saw.



I opened her bedroom door, her bed was completely untouched. Her friend, Rachel was only a one hour walk from here, and that message was sent well over 8 hours ago. She should of been home by now.



I made my way back downstairs, my footsteps heavy. I didn't want to open the door, but I had to. Deep down, I already knew what was on the other side.



After working up the physical and mental strength, I opened the door wide.

My sister had made it home after all.



I broke down into tears, her lifeless, bloodless husk laid in front of the door, she was so close to me, but I still couldn't save her. 



The fog had fed.



I eventually called the police. I cleaned up the blood on my kitchen floor before they got here, that would of been too much to explain.

I played dumb, acting like I had just got home and found this. There's no cameras around here, they cant prove that I'm lying.



It's an ongoing investigation, I know it will never be solved. only I knew the truth. It came from the fog.



I'm sharing this anonymously in hopes that someone will understand or relate to what I'm talking about, if so, please reach out.



For those who don't, just stay away from the fog in Nevada, and don't stare into it for too long.
