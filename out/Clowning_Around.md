“What about that one?” my husband, Edgar, had a mischievous smile on his face as he pointed at the shelf in the antique shop.

When I saw what he was pointing at, I replied, “Absolutely not! You know how I feel about clowns.”

“But he looks so sad sitting there all alone,” Edgar pretended to pout.

“That’s his problem,” I said, “Not mine.”

The old clown doll was dressed in a red and white suit that had faded over time. The three yellow pom poms, also badly faded, that were affixed to the front of its suit appeared flat and a bit frazzled.

“Why make a sad clown?” Edgar thought out loud.

He was referring to the huge painted frown on the clown’s face along with the teardrops affixed beneath each eye.

“They’re supposed to be happy,” he continued.

Happy or sad, I didn’t care. I didn’t like clowns. Never had and never will.

“Come on,” I motioned for him to follow me, “Let’s head on to the next store.”

The two of us were spending the day antique shopping, looking for dolls I could add to my growing collection. A hobby I started over fifty years ago when I was just a little girl.

\*\*\*

“You’re not going to believe this,” Edgar said.

“Believe what?” I asked.

“Look over there,” he pointed behind me.

I turned and was surprised to see another one of those clown dolls sitting in a display case.

“What’re the odds?” he said, “Two different stores with the same creepy little clown doll.”

“I don’t know and I don’t care,” I replied, “Come on,” I started walking toward the exit, “We’re leaving.”

\*\*\*

“I got a surprise for you,” Edgar announced, holding something behind his back.

“What?” I replied without enthusiasm, knowing I wasn’t going to like whatever it was.

“Ta-da!” he declared, pulling one of those horrible-looking clown dolls from behind his back.

Unamused, I turned away from him and continued browsing.

“Three clowns in three stores,” he said, “I think that’s a sign you should buy it.”

I ignored him.

“Sorry, Bozo,” I heard him say to the clown, “I tried.”

He walked off to some other part of the store after that.

\*\*\*

Once we got home, Edgar went to the back of the car and retrieved a bag from the trunk.

“What’s that?” I asked suspiciously.

“Nothing,” he replied.

“That better not be what I think it is,” I warned him.

“What do you think it is?” he asked innocently.

“One of those clown dolls.”

“What if it is?”

“If it is,” I jabbed my finger at him, “You’re not bringing it into the house.”

“Fine,” he sighed, “I'll put it on my workbench.” He started walking up the driveway to the unattached garage.

\*\*\*

The next morning I got up early like I always did and crept out of the room, doing my best not to wake up Edgar.

I went into the kitchen, made myself a cup of tea, and carried it into the sitting room where my collection of porcelain dolls was displayed but my dolls were no longer there. They had been replaced with dozens of identical clown dolls exactly like the one Edgar had bought.

I dropped my tea.

“Edgar!” I yelled, “Get your butt down here right now!”

I waited a moment to see if he would obey before yelling again.

When he didn’t show up after that, I stomped upstairs and threw the bedroom door open.

“Edgar! Get up!”

He didn’t move.

“Edgar?”

I stepped into the room and screamed, instead of finding Edgar sleeping in the bed like I thought I would, I found a life-sized version of the clown doll wearing his pajamas.
