I woke up early. I don’t know why I did this; my alarm didn‘t go off, and I didn't hear any loud noises. Maybe it was just my body telling me that I was in danger. So I got out of bed and put my glasses on. Then I noticed something. It was pitch black outside. It was 7 a.m. so I didn’t know why it was so dark. Then I focused more on the outside, and I couldn‘t see anything. I could barely make out anything other than a car parked on the side of the road and a bit of sidewalk that was in front of my window.

I did not know what was going on, so I checked my phone, which to my avail, was out of power. I plugged it in, but the charger wasn‘t working. Then I flicked the light switch, and nothing happened either; the only light illuminating my bedroom was a kind of dim battery-operated light. After realizing the power was out, I grabbed my power bank from my drawer and plugged my phone into it. While waiting for my phone to charge, I heard a crash coming from somewhere in my house. It scared the daylights out of me, so I went and locked my door out of paranoia. As I did that, my phone flickered on, as did an emergency alert coming from it.

“STAY INDOORS AND DO NOT MAKE LOUD NOISES. PLEASE WAIT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.”

”What the fuck?”

Throughout the years, I've gotten a handful of emergency alerts. Where I live, there are a lot of tornadoes, and usually it would be a tornado an hour away or a test drill. But this is different.

After reading the alert, the power flickered a bit and then stayed on. I knew it probably wouldn’t last, so I started charging my power bank. After I plugged it in, I left my bedroom. When I exited, I looked up and down the hallway. After confirming it was safe, I went to the kitchen. Everything looked normal, so I went to the basement door. I grabbed a knife, swung the door open, and turned on the lights. Then I saw what made the noise. A pile of boxes had fallen over. I closed the door and went to get something to eat.

I was eating a bowl of fruit loops when I realized that if the power was flickering on and off, then the water might go off too. I needed to collect water and take stock of my supplies. So I cleaned my bathtub and filled it with water. Then I used my bathroom sink to fill thermoses with some. After that, I went to my kitchen to get all my food onto the table to see how long it would all last me. I had a good amount of canned fish and beans. I also had fruits and bread, and if I rationed it all, then the food would probably last me 3–4 weeks. After I had water and food sorted out, I decided to call friends and family to see if they knew what was going on.

Mom didn’t pick up.

Dad didn't pick up.

My girlfriend didn't pick up.

Next was my childhood friend Trevor. He didn't pick up.

I was starting to get freaked out and decided I needed to fortify my house. I didn't know what was out there, and I wasn’t in a rush to find out. So I blocked the front and back doors with bookshelves, but for the windows, it got complicated. I couldn't make loud noises, and I didn't know how to block the windows without using a hammer or drill. So I just settled on closing the curtains.

Then my phone rang. It was Sarah, my girlfriend. I instantly picked up and waited for a noise.

“Hello?” She said it in a quiet voice.

”Sarah! I'm so glad you're okay. Do you know what might be happening? I can't see outside because of a fog.”

”You have to listen to me, Henry; you have to whisper.”

”Why? Do you know what's out there? in the fog?” I said, whispering.

”There are creatures, They-“ She began to stutter.

“What?”

“They broke in. My parents are...” She trailed off into a slight whimper.

”What?“ I said it with a stutter.

”They just ripped them apart while I hid in the The call abruptly ended.

”Shit”

Then I heard something moaning right outside my backyard. This was a moan of pure agony, like whatever was making that sound had been tortured for centuries and now wants revenge on whoever harmed it. And then I saw it. It had pale-ish skin, almost gray. It had a wide, agape mouth with sharp, one-inch-long teeth lining its jaws. And as I stared at it, its deep, large, sunken eyes stared back. I quickly ran into the basement and slammed the door shut as I heard that thing break the glass on my screen door.

I hid under a spare bed for what felt like days, occasionally hearing footsteps above, moaning, and other things. I just wanted to go back to bed, and I wish I never woke up this morning. Or was it morning? I had no way of knowing.

After a long time, I got out from under the bed. sore and tired from lying on the hard concrete floor. I had no way of knowing if it was safe, so I went to the door and opened a jar. My entire kitchen was flooded with dark fog. And I had two options. I ran for my bedroom and hoped I closed the door when I left it. Or grab my supplies and look for a safe place, hoping the creatures had the same amount of vision as I did.

I decided to go with the first option. I very quietly opened the door and walked to my bedroom. It was hard navigating through the fog, but the light being on in the kitchen made it easier.

I got to my bedroom and shut the door, taking a sign of relief. I laid on my bed and closed my curtains. And stuff some shirts under the door because I didn‘t have full faith in those rubber strips I installed. It may have been a stupid decision, but I went to sleep. It is better to die peacefully than to be scared.

When I woke up, the first thing I did was check my phone. And there was another alert.

”DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH THEM. DO NOT MAKE NOISE. DO NOT STAY IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THEM. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.”

I stared at the alert. Knowing this information would help me, I decided I needed to leave or just find another house, as I don't know what effects breathing in this fog has, and I sure as hell wasn‘t going to find out.

So I packed a backpack, enough water and food to last me 4 days, a combat knife, 5 face masks with tape around the sides to make a better filter, and my phone.

First, I needed to go to the attic to see if it got me over the fog. I carefully opened my bedroom door and slowly walked to the attic. I got there just by memory of my home layout. I pulled down the ladder and climbed up. I looked through the window and still saw fog. My next very bad idea was opening the window and trying to climb onto the roof. I couldn't see for shit and I almost lost my grip and fell. So after rethinking things, I went back downstairs, grabbed my backpack and some other things, and left.

Where was I going? The apartment building. It's where my girlfriend lives, but another reason I went was because there was a courtyard in the middle of it with a glass dome on top. So if I am lucky, the fog may not have gotten inside.

It was hard to get around. Google Maps was all that was saving me. I walked over corpses, bumped into lamp posts, and at one point saw one of them. They looked more terrifying in the fog, and I slowly backed away from them. Then it looked directly at me. It felt like my heartbeat. I almost looked in the eyes, but I looked down and kept backing away. I closed my eyes, and it continued to walk down the road. I kept walking until I got to the apartment, but the entire time I was going there, I felt watched. Humans are visual creatures, and not knowing what's 4 feet in front of you will surely mess with your psyche.

It took me a while, but I found the entrance. I walked in, and the entire reception area was filled with fog. I made my way to the stairs and started trying to find the floor Sarah lived on. I was sure it was 19D. So I started going up the stairs when I slipped on something. I'm not sure if it was a liver or an appendix. But I fell down the stairs with a loud crash. My back hurt like hell, but my adrenaline got me up as I heard the creatures running to me. I was surrounded as I heard them running down and up the stairs to me. So I ran into Floor B and ran like hell. I heard them behind me, but I wasn't going to look back.

The hallway was coming to an end, and I started trying to open the doors. Then 29B clicked open, and I swung the door shut as I ran into the apartment. They were banging on the door, and it wasn't going to last long. I ran to the balcony, and I dropped to the one below right as the door was busted off its hinges.

Sitting on 29A’s balcony while looking into the fog. I held my breath and replaced my face mask, drank some water, and ate some food.

I needed to get going. So I tried opening the door, but it wouldn't budge. I heard the creatures in the apartment above scouring for me like a starving pack of wolves.

The fog felt more menacing than ever, and I wanted to get away from it badly. So I looked at what I had and decided I could use my knife to try to break the lock. And after a few attempts, I got it open. This apartment had no fog in it, but the power was off. I turned on my phone's torch, closed the door, and took a deep breath. Then I realized how badly I needed to piss, so I went to the bathroom, and I saw a rotting corpse with a revolver in its hand. I pried the gun from the corpses hand and put in in my pocket. 4 bullets left. I took a piss in the bathtub, which felt uncomfortable because a corpse was watching me the whole time.

After that, I left the apartment and went into the hallway. I went up the stairs to floor D and then to Sarah‘s apartment. The door was busted down, and a horrible stench reeked from it. I saw her parents corpses on the floor. I gagged. Their guts were strewn across the furniture and looked half-eaten, I was glad that I could barely see anything. I searched the apartment for Sarah but found nothing. My next hope was the courtyard.

I left Sarah’s apartment and with my revolver in hand I went down the hallway. I could barely see a before I knew it I was infront of an elevator. I must have taken a wrong route or something so I retraced my steps the best I could and got to the stairs. I started descending to the lobby. And upon arrival I tried to find a map of sorts, because I never actually went to this courtyard. 

From all my searching I was not able to find a map so I just decided to start moving through the hallways searching for signs, or anything that could point me in the direction of the courtyard. I was walking through the reception when I found a sign pointing into the hallway

It said: Courtyard, Laundromat, Gym

I started following the arrows. I was making decent speed until I got to a metal door, that said on it “Courtyard” 

I tried opening it but it was barred shut from the inside. I had to find another way in. I looked around and saw a door that said “Staff Entrance” I went and opened the door. Inside was a control room of sorts that had not been flooded by the fog. There were buttons to turn on sprinklers, unlock doors, etc. In the room there was another door that said ”Courtyard” This is it. I swung the door open and saw the courtyard, no fog, dead plants. I saw the lights were on which was strange until I heard someone behind me say: 

“Stop” 

“Drop the revolver”

I dropped my weapon and turned around slowly to see a man holding a shotgun to my head.

”What do you want?”

”Listen i‘m just looking for my girlfriend Sarah okay?” I said.

”Oh Sarah? I dont know what happened to her or her parents, But they lived in 19D, If they’re still alive.”

I dropped to the floor crying, realizing that everyone I loved is dead. 

“Listen, You can stay here. But I only have enough food and water to last a week. So you can stay here with your own supplies but you aren‘t gonna dig into mine.”

I told him thanks and i went to go sleep on one of the flower beds. I took off my mask and opened my phone to see another alert. 

“EVACUATION AT THE WEATHERBY CAMPUS. DO NOT WANDER OUTDOORS. HAVE A FACE COVERING AT ALL TIMES. IN GOD WE TRUST”
