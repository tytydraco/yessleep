 I don’t care to admit that I suffered from depression for years earlier in my life. Unable to free myself from my bed and I found it impossible to sleep without a bottle or two to ease the self-doubt that plagued my mind. This was all until I met Lisa. It seems like a fairy tale when I think back on that day. Her face beamed like a ray of sunshine and her golden locks came down to her shoulders as she stood there holding my parcel. She was new to delivering packages to my neighbourhood. I even found myself ordering things I didn’t need just so I could see her, but she didn’t seem to mind. In fact, I think she thought it was sweet since she invited me out for coffee after work one evening. We’ve been married for 30 years, and I can’t imagine my life without her. I loved her, and still do love her but things have changed now.

 

The signs were small at first. Things like forgetting where she put her phone or her keys, nothing that would really call for a diagnosis. This continued for a couple months but then she started to forget about plans. On multiple occasions, we would plan to go out for lunch together during work, but she would never show up, leaving me there in the restaurant at a loss. I never confronted her about it. I would rather jokingly say “Did you forget about anything today?” for her to just look at me confused. Then she did something I couldn’t ignore. She left the oven on for hours without realising it. I pretended it didn’t happen but after her doing it 3 times it was a clear sign that she needed help. Middle-stage dementia, bordering on late stage. That’s what the doctor said.

 

I tried everything. Prescriptions, Chinese medicine, and alternative health care like lion’s mane and ginger shots. I prayed for her every single night only for my pleas to go unanswered. One evening I brought her home a cat since I had heard from someone that taking care of something could help her. I was desperate. Day by day I could see her slipping away from me. I only ask for forgiveness for what I did. If my prayers were to go unanswered then I would venture into the 9 circles and retrieve my prize.

 

She seemed to improve. Her late-night ventures vanished almost overnight leaving me to have my first untroubled sleep in weeks. Not only that but she even started to remind me of my own meals with a plate of breakfast each morning. I couldn’t believe it. I held on a little longer each time we hugged hiding the tears of joy that seeped through my stoic facade that I’ve had to keep up for so long. I would sometimes catch her playing with our cat Willow, her bubbly self shining through. My wife was back again, and I never wanted her to leave. I kept my ritual a secret from her and performed it every day. Perhaps this was my blunder.

 

I awoke one night to a smash of glass. Sitting bolt upright and drenched in sweat. Someone was breaking in. I began hyperventilating, this can't happen, this can’t happen, not while Lisa was just starting to come back to me. I looked over to the other side of the bed, but Lisa was gone. This was the worst possible scenario. Either Lisa was out there wrestling with whoever had broken in or her condition was worsening again. Both cases sent a shiver down my spine. Grabbing a torch from my bedside table I tiptoed over to the door turning the handle slowly and creeping out of the room trying to make as little sound as possible. The corridor before me was pitch black but I didn’t want to turn my torch on until I was sure of the situation lest I give my position away. Edging my way along the wall I could hear scrambling throughout the house, the hardwood floor elevating any indication of movement. As I rounded the corner of the corridor and made my way to the kitchen, I saw her there. Her white nightgown illuminated in the moonlight from the skylight above. Hunched over on her knees her back facing me.

 

“Lisa” I whispered. She didn’t react.

 

“Lisa!” I whispered a little louder.

 

She still didn’t react. Even if there was an intruder, they surely would have heard me or seen Lisa there. I flicked on the torch and pointed it towards Lisa as I walked towards her.

 

“Lisa. Sweetheart. Let’s go back to bed, okay?”                          

 

Pain surged through my foot as blood trickled down from the now-open gash on my heel. As I looked down holding in my moans of pain, I found what the sound I heard earlier was. It was one of the wine glasses we usually leave out after our evening meal. Lisa must have knocked it over during her confusion.

 

“Lisa don’t move. I’ll come to you, okay? There’s glass all over the floor.”

 

Navigating around the shards of glass I was now within arm’s reach. She seemed to be shivering. Her head bobbed down periodically, and her arms were hidden from view. After everything we’ve been through together, seeing her like this was like a dagger to my heart. I placed my hand on her shoulder already smiling so I wouldn’t scare her.

 

“Lisa. It’s me, Jack.”

 

Lisa turned around. Her eyes a pale yellow instead of her ocean blue that used to captivate me, dirty blonde hair matted to her forehead, and Willow… torn in several places with his head entirely within Lisa’s gaping mouth, fragments of bone jutting out from within Lisa’s teeth with a steady stream of blood dribbling down her lips. I froze. The smile quickly dropped from my face only to be replaced with a look of disgust as my lips remained open waiting for the words that never came. Her eyes seemed to gloss over as dots of blue began to return.

 

“Jack?” She began to sob.

 

“Jack? Jack, what happened?”

 

She looked down at Willow as a look of shock shot across her face. Holding the Willow close to her chest as tears streamed down her face mixing with her blood-stained cheeks washing it away. My heart thumping in my chest I reached a weary hand out towards her.

 

“Le- Let- Let's get you cleaned up dear.”

 

She refused to let go of Willow as she sat there in the shower, the water washing away both her and Willow’s blood fusing them together in a whirlpool wrapping around the drain. When she got out of the shower, she let me take Willow from her as I set him down by the sink and sought to the numerous scratches across her arms and feet as well as my own. Leaving me there as she walked towards the bedroom. I spent 2 hours cleaning the bathroom and kitchen. There was surprisingly little mess, but I took my time. I think I just didn’t want to face what had just happened until I finally came to Willow. We only had him for a couple months, but I had grown to love him. He was a curious cat, always getting into the pantry, and would never say no to a treat. He reminded me of Lisa a little bit, always getting me into trouble with the neighbours after he ruined their gardens. I buried him in the flower bed in the back garden, I thought it a fitting place for him.

 

The following morning I found Lisa in the kitchen making me breakfast again. It sent me into a short frenzy when I found her missing the second time.

 

“Good morning Dear. Have you seen Willow at all? He hasn’t had his breakfast.”

 

My heart ached for a brief second. She had forgotten all about it.

 

“Yes dear. I let him out yesterday lunchtime. Maybe he hasn’t come back yet”.

 

She shrugged her shoulders and went back to cooking. She asked about Willow every morning and every morning I played into the narrative that he was missing. I stopped my rituals for a while but then her dementia started to get worse again. I couldn’t bear to see her that way. No matter what I had to do I wouldn’t just sit by and let her slip away again. I went back to my rituals. I performed them twice a day now, once in the morning and again at night. I bought weighted blankets to make sure she wouldn’t get up in the middle of the night, but it only got worse. I woke up in the middle of the night to her thrashing unable to free herself from the blanket as she swung wildly, yellow glistening across her eyes. I had to jump on top of her and pin her arms down keeping her there until she exhausted herself and went back to sleep.

 

I couldn’t ignore it anymore. If I were to keep my rituals going, then she needed a sacrifice. I started to pick up hitchhikers and homeless people on my way back from work and offered them a night at the house. The ones who accepted all met the same fate at the hands of my wife. It started to become a routine for us. I would set someone up in the guest room, Lisa would have her fill, and then at exactly 3 AM every night I would wipe the blood away from her mouth and hands, get rid of the body, and bleach the floor. This worked for a while. My wife’s memory was just as good as the day I met her, maybe even more so although she never seemed to recall the night before, but then her mind slipped again.

 

I had set a hitchhiker up in the guest room just as I did for the past couple of weeks. I didn’t ask his name, but he was just as eager as the rest at the chance of free accommodation. My alarm was set for 3 AM. I had done this a couple of times now; my body had adjusted to this new sleep schedule and my life was beginning to have some sense of normality back to it despite the morbid situation. I didn’t wake to my alarm that night. I felt something wet drip onto my forehead. Out of all the places in my house I just had to have a leak above my pillow as the storm raged outside my window. I tried to dismiss it, but it grew more gradual and the droplets larger. Wiping my eyes with my hand I looked up…. my stomach dropped. Lisa was on the ceiling above me, her limbs arranged like a spider’s would be, thick strands of drool streamed from a malformed snout; her dirty blonde hair hanging downwards seemingly encasing her entire head, and her glistening yellow eyes. She was wearing her white nightgown, but it was stained with blood. Had she already killed the hitchhiker? Had she forgotten she’d already had a sacrifice?

 

“Lisa! Lisa don’t!”

 

I scrambled out of bed my body shivering as my mind was torn between a flight response and undying love. Her eyes followed me as my body took control and backed towards the door. She unravelled herself from the ceiling and onto the bed standing on all fours, her nails like knives tearing into the bed covers.

 

“L- Lisa, please. Please try and remember! It's me! It's Jack!”

 

She bolted towards me as I opened the door and ran down the corridor and rounded the corner. I heard her skid and slam into the wall, but my body wouldn’t turn around, it wouldn’t listen to my brain anymore as it continued its way to the front door. My heart was racing, my eyes bulging out of my head as I fumbled with the lock. I heard her feet smacking across the floor as I finally flung the door open and sprinted towards the road, car lights blinding my vision.

 

*\*Hoooooonkkkk!!!!\**     

 

The car swerved across the road as I reached the other side hearing a slam behind me. My body released me as I managed to turn around to see my wife lying across the pavement, the car still barrelling down the street and out of sight. Tears began to stream down my face as I tiptoed towards her.

 

“Lisa. Lisa, please. Please! Please be okay!”

 

She snapped her head up launching herself towards me as I ducked. Flying overhead she landed on her side in the field behind standing up and taking off into the darkness.

 

“Lisa! Come back! Come back! Please!”

 

My words echoed out into the night. I haven’t seen her since. I regret everything. I regret my rituals; I regret putting her through that torturous routine each night. I regret ever meeting her. If she never met me at all then maybe she would have met someone else, someone better. Even if I spent the rest of my life drinking my sorrows away in that flat, I would have done it all and more for her. I love her, so please. If anyone sees her let me know and I'll be down as quick as I can, and above all else… approach with caution.
