Despite my hysteric pleas, the coffin lid kept sliding. The harsh friction of stone moving against stone filled my ears, like the sonorous bellowing of an unseen God, welcoming me into their vast kingdom, excited to show me around.

A waning beam of light, a rumbling *snap* of the lid settling into place, and then there was nothing.

I'm plunged into blackness; unfettered, impenetrable, and all-consuming. Incomprehensibly perfect darkness, like the deepest ocean floor or the most distant reaches of space.

My mind spins. My heart quakes against my chest.

*The truth didn’t work.*

*I need something else.*

\------

***(15 minutes earlier.)***

“*This…this is a huge misunderstanding…I didn’t know him…I didn’t know Jom…*” I sputtered, now only feet away from my waiting tomb.

No one responded. Not a peep of recognition from any of the attendees. I wondered if the words had actually left my mouth or if I had just imagined they did as Bassel forced me closer to the marble casket, inch by tortuous inch.

He was looming over me like a rain cloud, leading me forward with a burly arm wrapped tightly around my shoulders. At that point in my life, I hadn’t ever been married, which gave the slow, ritualistic procession towards the corpse in a box a certain perverse, darkly humorous quality. Like this was the closest *I’d* ever get to being a bride, given my sordid lifestyle. A sick joke; the universe chuckling alongside Horus, having a hearty laugh at my expense.

It was *almost* right, too. It had most of the pieces, at least. From a distance, it could have looked like a wedding, if you didn’t squint too hard.

Bassel, an older gentleman, guiding me towards my soon-to-be husband, giving me away till *death do us part*. Akila, the officiator, reciting the ceremonial words and ordaining the marriage. A crowd of loved ones, waiting patiently to witness the union.

All the cardinal signs of a marriage service; excluding my pulseless betrothed, of course. I looked at him and felt a frantic repulsion cascading through my body.

This was no wedding.

Jom had been completely drained of fluid, crumpling his skin and causing his body to curl slightly forward like a dead spider. A single, oversized nail pierced his skull, entering one temple and exiting the other, with bits of light reflecting off the shimmering metal visible in his eye sockets. If his eyes were present, they would have been shish kabobbed. They had been excised, however. I’d rather not speculate on whether someone performed that surgery pre- or post-mortem.

As I approached the casket, my thoughts and actions had stagnated, mired in the sheer impossibility of my circumstances. A paralytic disbelief of sorts; a desperate prayer to wake up from this fever dream.

A smell broke that stagnation. The scent of embalming fluid, ripe yet artificial like a cucumber pickled in bleach. When it hit my nostrils, my body sprang to life.

Formaldehyde worked like smelling salts that day.

“***Let me the fuck go***,” I shrieked, arcing my arm forward to send a pointed elbow behind me, crashing into Bassel’s diaphragm.

The blow stunned him momentarily, allowing me to squat down and out of the arm that had been tangled around my shoulders. It wasn’t enough, though. As I turned to run, he extended his leg in the direction I was escaping, tripping me with the heel of his white boot. I fell hard, face first, my forehead bouncing off the tile floor with enough force to cause my ears to ring.

Terror had made me forget the golden rule; the key to survival in the seedy underbrush where I earned my keep.

If they’re bigger than you, go for the eyes or the balls.

I moaned on the floor, concussed and bleeding from a fresh cut over my eyebrow. Before I knew it, Bassel had pulled me upright. My vision spun, making the room a disorientating blur of light and movement. In the meantime, the attendees had erupted, jumping from their seats and unleashing cries of anger and disgust, enraged by my treachery.

When I could focus, my eyes landed on Akila, still sitting in a wheelchair next to the coffin. Deep hurt twisted the old woman’s face; wrath burned in her eyes, yet her quivering lips showed her dejection, as if she couldn’t decide whether to scream or sob.

I bent down, making my face level with hers, trying to explain my outrageous circumstances over the shouting and caterwauling of the white-clad funeral goers.

Unfortunately, the words came out rushed. The coherency was spotty at best. There was too much to explain and not enough time to do it in.

*“Listen, Akila - my name is not Tara, it’s Robin. I work for an escort agency. My job involves attending funerals, sometimes pretending to be someone I’m not. They assigned me to go to a funeral for a man named ‘John’, but my driver must have dropped me off on the wrong day. I’m paid to lie. I didn’t know your son…”*

Somewhere in the crowd, I could hear Horus shouting at us.

*“Whatever she’s saying, it’s not true! She just doesn’t want to be a conduit anymore for Dad! Just like Mom!”*

Akila turned her head away from me, her reply bubbling with resentment.

*“You’re almost as bad as Diane, Tara.”*

*“Khepri have mercy on your soul.”*

\------

I beat my knuckles bloody against the marble lid, but it wasn’t any use. Although the casket was wide enough to fit two people, it was less than a foot high. I couldn’t swing my arm back far enough to generate meaningful force. Even if I could have, though, it wouldn’t have mattered. Not even Bassel’s tree-trunk biceps could have broken through solid stone. What chance did I have?

Still, I had to do something.

Eventually, one of my punches went off course, curving a little too far to my left. When it rebounded off the lid, it fell straight down, and the back of my hand clipped the dead man’s face before I could retract the limb to its original position on my chest. At that point, I stopped my futile barrage. I had been doing all I could to avoid touching the corpse. Now that I had, all of my energy and focus needed to be diverted to keeping myself from vomiting.

My mind replayed the memory of that sensation on a loop.

He was drier than I expected. Desiccated and stiff like rotten apricot or expired beef jerky. *Leathery* comes close to describing it. *Reptilian* comes even closer. Honestly, though, I can’t find something that fits just right. There just aren’t the words for it.

An unexpected *thunk* erupted under the tips of my shoulder blades, and I finally screamed. I had been trying to stay calm. Conserve every precious molecule of oxygen that I could. But the surprise broke my concentration, and I let loose gallons of pent-up terror into a single, earsplitting noise. I coughed and wheezed from the strain it put on my vocal cords, but as soon as I could, I revved up my larynx and started all over again.

Eventually, I ran out of steam, shrieks puttering out into choked wails and smaller fits of coughing. That exhaustion, thankfully, was helpful. The numbness was centering, in a sense. It allowed the more analytic parts of my brain a chance to take the wheel.

I needed a plan.

So, I listened closely, trying to use ambient noise to determine where I was. With my ears perked, I could appreciate a gentle tapping from somewhere above me. It sounded like the dainty pitter-pattering of drizzling rain, but it wasn’t consistent. There were pauses in between the tapping every few seconds or so.

The realization caused a surge of panic to explode through my chest like dynamite, but I maintained my composure. With time running thin, I couldn’t afford *not* to maintain my composure.

The *thunk* was the casket colliding with the bottom of a grave, and the tapping sound was dirt being shoveled onto me.

Onto *us.*

Just then, there was another sound. Something much closer, internal to the coffin, rather than the external tapping of the dirt against stone. A quick *pop* from somewhere beside me.

The creaking of a joint that hadn’t moved in quite a while.

\------

*“Oh Christ! Oh my God, he’s biting me!*

“*He’s scratching at my face, Jesus Christ let me the fuck out of here!”*

The tapping stopped. There was muffled conversation from somewhere outside the coffin, but I was too insulated to hear what was said.

I kept screaming.

*“Jom, I’m sorry. God, I’m so sorry!”*

*“He doesn’t want me here! He doesn’t want me here!”*

About a minute later, a tiny glimmer of light entered the casket, mirroring my evolving fate. Life snatched away from death at the eleventh hour; not much time to spare.

The lid fell to the ground with a heavy *thump*. Two blurry figures stood above me, but I couldn’t discern exactly who they were. The sunlight was blinding.

I must have looked like death. Long, four-fingered scratches all over my face and chest, horizontal swipes overlapping with vertical ones to form bloody cross-links. Wild terror stitched into my eyes. Ragged breaths like I was in the throes of an asthma attack.

A familiar voice from outside the grave rang down to me.

*“You said ‘he doesn’t want me here’? That’s what you said?”* shouted Akila.

I slowed my hyperventilation. My vision finally adjusted, and I saw two male attendees I didn’t recognize, eyes darting between me and Jom’s corpse. Inspecting us. By the time they had opened the coffin, Jom had stilled.

*“Yes…he started…he started whispering that to me. Then…then he attacked me.”*

There was a pregnant pause. The men looked up, waiting for their next orders.

*“Alright, then. He must be rejecting you. Guess he knows better than we do. If you weren’t his love, you wouldn’t be able to grant him renewal, I suppose. Pull her up here.”*

*“Someone get my grandson from the van, too.”*

\------

Once I was topside, Bassel became my watchdog again. There was discussion about what to do with me, but I didn’t wait for them to come to an agreement.

As fortune would have it, my captor was fairly well endowed, both his stem and his berries. Makes it all easier to find in a pinch.

I spun, grasped his family jewels, twisted them around their axis and pulled down, bringing Bassel to his knees. Once his head was within reach, I jabbed a thumb into his eye. Don’t think I blinded him, but he was certainly incapacitated at that point.

Before long, I was sprinting out of the graveyard. I passed Horus on my way out, writhing against the ground, two attendees dragging him by his wrists towards the hole his father was lying in.


He saw me, and I’m glad I had the presence of mind to wave at him as I was dashing by, a massive smile plastered on my face.

\------

Of course, Jom didn’t *actually* rise from the dead. That popping sound *was* his shoulder joint, but it made a noise because I accidentally knocked into it, not because he was moving it.

But that gave me an idea.

What I realized was that in order for those psychos to believe that I wasn’t who I had said I was originally, I needed objective evidence that I was an imposter. From what I could gather, they were trying to use me to resurrect Jom. But, like any cult, the process had rules.

*“Passionate love is the best conduit.”*

*“The youngest son will do if passionate love is not available.”*

*“Your black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.”*

I pretended it was real and imagined what might happen. Maybe Jom would attack me, desperate not to be buried with a con artist that wouldn’t actually provide him with new life because their sacrifice didn’t abide by the rules.

So, I scratched myself to hell and back. Spewed some bullshit about how he wasn’t actually dead. Made sure to sell the idea while not making my actual intentions obvious.

It worked, and I am beyond grateful that it did. That said, there’s no justice to any of it. Horus didn’t deserve to be in that pit either.

But, at the end of the day, I’m a survivalist.

Better him than me.

\------

I can’t believe all of that was thirty years ago. Time really is a wonder and a terror.

Never went back to the agency after that near miss. Partially because of how big they fucked up, stranding me there on the wrong day. Mostly, though, I left because I didn’t want Akila and Bassel to show up at some point, looking to snuff out a loose thread. I mean, I told Akila my first name and my occupation. I felt like it wouldn’t require too much legwork to find me if they really wanted to.

Packed my bags, moved across the country. Kept my first name but changed my surname. Got myself a husband and a few kids, as well as a job as a hairdresser. You know, I finally integrated into society. Left my niche behind, so to speak.

Over the years, the memories have grown a bit dusty. They don’t have as much terror associated with them as they used to. Which, in turn, has caused me to be plagued by nostalgia. A longing for the good old days, when I was really and truly alive.

Of course, that’s all delusional rubbish. I just needed a reminder; a sample of that long dormant fear.

I sure as shit got one.

About a week ago, I was in the middle of an appointment, going through the motions like I had so many times before. I finished up, about to walk away, when the client said something. A complete non-sequitur. Barely said a word before that.

*“You know, it’s the color that’s really the key.”*

I shot the client a funny look, because I had no idea what they were talking about. They had asked for a trim, not a dye job.

They saw my confusion in the mirror, gave me a lecherous smile, and continued.

*“Color is so important, love. It doesn’t get as much credit or attention as it used to, but that doesn’t mean it’s lost its potency. Quite the opposite, actually. It’s a resource that’s remained relatively untapped, which means the potency has accumulated, gathering over time. Now, my love, it's a wellspring.”*

*“What I’m saying is, it all would have worked just fine if you stayed with me. You really were dressed for the occasion, Robin.”*

And finally, I see it. He looks *like* Horus, but not exactly.

I hadn’t ever seen him with eyes before, but I suppose that man was Jom.

*“Call me sometime, okay? We have a few things to clear up.”*

He handed me a card on his way out. I’m staring at it now, fighting back nausea, feeling my heart slam against my ribs, rapid like the wings of a hummingbird. There’s a number on the back.

*“Amsi, museum curator for the Khepri Foundation. \[xxx-xxx-xxxx\]”*

Pure white on both sides.

Golden scarab on the back, with a lotus flower etched into its wings.

They finally found me.
