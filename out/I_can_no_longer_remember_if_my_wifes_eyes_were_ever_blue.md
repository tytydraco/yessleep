I am not generally a person who is interested in the paranormal. I laugh at the stupid stories my friends tell me and never feel the slightest bit concerned about bumps at night or the moving spectres of the imagination. So, naturally, my friends try to test me. Horror movies? No problem. Going to a graveyard at night? Trivial. Honestly, put on a horror movie and I will probably fall asleep as if it is the sweetest bedtime fable.

Never did I think that an experience would force me to stop and clear my head. Yet here I am, sitting at my desk, peering into the woodland beyond my window and hearing the faint calls of what lies beyond. I have never felt such an urge to take off into the dark softness of the trees until now. My heart tells me to run free. My mind tells me this is not natural. This is not me. The pull toward the woods must be the product of some ghastly influence.

It began last September. Coming off a hard day of work, I looked forward to the warm confines of my bed. Soon I was asleep.

I found myself in a desolate clearing in a dead wood. A path stretched ahead of me and ruins slumped to either side. The air was gray with a thick milky fog that smelled faintly of smoke. The dead trees were twisted and sinister as a witch’s hand. Then came the scent of rotting flesh, so sweet and pungent I nearly gagged.

Off in the distance, a deep voice whispered my name. “James… James. Feel the embrace of nature…”

Something was watching me. A tall shadow stretched across the ground. I could make out no features except for the eyes. Black. Patient. Fixed on me.

I awoke with a start. “What the hell is wrong with me?” Just a dream, I told myself. Tomorrow was the second anniversary of my wife’s death, and grief has a way of stirring strange things.

We had been married a decade before her sickness. No children. Just two lovebirds flying through storms together. Our first date was along the forested banks of the Hudson River. I brought sandwiches and fresh apple cider doughnuts I made myself. She leaned in for a kiss.

But in my mind’s eye now, her irises aren’t blue. They are black. I do not know why.

I remember a day in the forest birdwatching. She loved cardinals and I loved bluejays. “James,” she called, “I hear the call of an endangered…” The name escapes me. She vanished into the bushes. Fifteen minutes. Then thirty. Her voice returned from behind me. “James, don’t worry. I’m fine. I love you. You need to…” I am certain she said Feel the embrace of nature. I am equally certain she did not.

Days later, I was sifting through paranormal junk online, zombies in Mahopac, Bigfoot in Bloomingburg, a man who discovered ghosts in his cellar after a healthy dose of LSD, when something caught my eye. Dudleytown. Connecticut.

And then, as I scrolled, a whisper threaded into my ear.

Sir Robert Dudley… Henry called him traitor… the witch’s curse crossed the sea…

A few steps later, I was in my living room, not on a trail, and the whisper changed.

No… not Dudley. The name was Radley. Henry loved him. The curse came from a starving hermit with teeth like pinecones.

The voice was calm, patient, as if explaining something obvious to a slow child.

I told myself I did not believe it. Which is why, of course, I went there.

The next weekend I hiked deep into the woods. Birds chattered, leaves rustled, the wind cooled my skin. Then the wind died. The birds fell silent.

The trees seemed to lean closer, their crooked limbs settling into the posture of conspirators. A warmth spread through my chest, like my wife’s arms were around me again. The smoky fog slid in, brushing my ankles.

The curse clung to the Dudleys… or the Radleys… or maybe it was you all along…

I stepped forward. The sweet, rotten smell swelled until it became almost pleasant.

“James…” The voice was close enough that my breath came back to me in echoes. “Embrace nature.”

The fog parted. A figure stood ahead. Tall. Horned. Eyes blacker than night.

It did not move, yet each beat of my heart felt slower, deeper. A hoof scraped the earth.

Or perhaps I have no name at all. You will name me later, when you are ready to remember.

I could not tell if I was about to run or kneel.

I ran. Branches lashed my arms, the forest tightening behind me. My lungs burned, my vision swam, and then I was in my car. I do not remember the road. I do not remember turning the key.

I remember the mirror. And the man in it. My eyes were not blue.

I am a man. A human. Separate from nature.

I must be.

The trees are laughing again.

And this time, I am laughing with them.
