I didn’t expect what happened next.

Soon as Brock saw Wireface closing in, he grabbed Mason by the collar, and practically threw him towards Wireface in a single motion, before scurrying off into the woods. As he fled, Brock manically started screaming phrases like “Not me!” and “I’m not dying!” Mason practically stumbled into Wireface, but tried pushing himself off him and took a blind swing. Wireface effortlessly thwarted the attempted attack, grabbed Mason by his collar, and headbutted him twice with his barbed-wired face.

The two strikes littered Mason’s face with cuts and punctures that bled profusely. He seemed stunned by Wireface’s two bashes, who then took his free hand, pressed it against Mason’s face, and started violently twisting it in a grinding windshield wiper-like motion. Mason started screaming in sheer agony, and wildly thrashed about, appearing totally helpless to break free of Wireface’s grasp. I picked up sounds of ripping and scraping, which is when I realized the hand Wireface was mashing Mason’s face with….was wrapped in barbed wire. I watched in horror as Wireface then grabbed Mason’s shirt with both his hands, and threw him into the tripwire he set up, causing Mason to fall and get entangled in the other strands of barbed wiring he weaved in between the trees.

Despite some blood getting in my eyes, I got back on my feet right as Wireface began looking between me and Mason, whose body twisted and flailed as he released some of the most horrible blood-curdling shrieks I’ve ever heard. How could Brock do that? I thought while waiting for my fight-or-flight instincts to kick in….they were best friends. I thought they’d both take a bullet for each other without thinking twice. How could Brock turn on someone like that so quickly…use them as their escape decoy?

My train of thought was interrupted when Wireface began stepping in my direction. Fuck it, I thought before turning, and sprinting towards the river. Mason’s screams persisted, and rang throughout the woods as I ran, sending sharp chills down my spine and twisting my stomach into tight knots. Maybe Brock had the right idea….why risk my life for someone who showed no regard for mine—someone who literally stabbed me earlier tonight…? And what about Brock, I thought. Can I even trust him after what he just did to Mason? Would he do the same to me if he had a chance?

While contemplating these thoughts, I inadvertently stumbled down an embankment that brought me to the river, coming to a halt on the muddy bank. I lay semi-coiled in a ball, gritting my teeth from the sharp burning that came from the stab wound. After the pain became….manageable, I slowly crawled towards the rivershore to wash off my face. The left side burned when I applied water to it, and I could feel the lacerations Wireface made when he struck me with that same hand he wrapped in barbed wire. I was able to walk, but the pain coming from my stab wound every time I took a step or deep breath was excruciating. I didn’t see any footprints along the riverbank, making me wonder what became of Brock. Stephanie was still out there too, I thought, stopping in my tracks. Should I go back and find her….? The pulsating pain coming from my stab wound prompted me to quickly dismiss the thought.

It started to rain. A light drizzle quickly turned into an all-out downpour. Despite being injured and soaked to the bone, I continued following the river, and eventually reached the lot. I walked up to Brock’s pickup—which was the only car in the lot—and peered inside to see it was unoccupied. Brock’s truck was locked, so in light of the circumstances, I smashed the driver’s window with a rock to get inside. I started feeling around the driver’s side visor, where I knew Brock kept a spare key. After finding it and turning on the car, I caught a glimpse of myself in the rearview mirror. Three deep gashes and about a half dozen puncture marks ran across the front and left side of my face. I was lucky to get away with just that, unable to even fathom those horrific ways the others met their demise. I brandished a few other scrapes, cuts, and bruises, but my biggest concern was the stab wound, which still seethed with pain.

I sped out of the lot, and onto the dirt road. It still downpoured, and even with the windshield wipers, was difficult to see clearly. While rounding a bend, I noticed something standing in the road. The flashes of its plaid and brownish beige clothes were all I needed to know it was Wireface. Gripping the steering wheeI, I didn’t hesitate to stomp on the accelerator, and plowed right into Wireface. His limp upper torso slammed on the truck’s hood before getting sucked under, and was turned into a speed bump. After feeling the entire car run over him, I slammed on the brakes, and stared at Wireface’s battered body through my side view mirror.

I waited several minutes before stepping out of the truck. I probably should have kept driving, but wanted to confirm he was actually dead. Another part of me hoped he was taking his last breaths so I could observe his final moments with my own eyes. There was a brown burlap sack over his head. He wore a tattered plaid shirt that was blue and green in color, along with dark gray overalls. His limbs were bent and twisted in different directions, which was when I noticed both his feet were missing. It looked like they were literally torn off his legs, and when I turned towards the spot where he stood, I saw two fleshy stumps protruding from a pair of shoes situated in the center of the road.

Moving away from the body, I squinted in bewilderment, as a strong uneasiness began to materialize. I realized tight strands of barbed wire ran across the road, and were tightly wrapped around the severed feet, holding them in place. One of them also had a subtle detail that made me begin to physically tremble.

Just above the left foot’s ankle….was a small dark blue butterfly tattoo.

“No….no-no-no-no.” I murmured, feeling the panic unravel as I scrambled back towards the body, and pulled the burlap sack off its head.

My fears were confirmed when I found myself staring into Steph’s lifeless eyes. The site sent sharp pains shooting out of my stab wound, as I fell to my knees and began sobbing Steph’s name. Her mouth hung agape, like it was frozen mid scream as if trying to say “Stop!” It was an accident, I thought. Anybody else would have done the same thing….How could I have known? She looked just like him! That was when I noticed the clothes—and burlap sack—she wore, although similar-looking, didn’t identically match Wireface’s attire. There was nothing I could do now, I thought, and slowly stood back up, trying not to disturb my stab wound. I kissed my hand and was about to place it on Steph’s forehead, when I spotted something emerge from the tree line.

It was Wireface.

He just stood there in the pouring rain, seeming like he was both taunting me and lavishing over my reaction to running over Stephanie. A knotty queasiness formed in my stomach, and before he had a chance to get any closer, I listened to my instincts and scrambled back into Brock’s truck. I caught one last fleeting image of Wireface in the rear view mirror, who stood alongside the road, canting his head, and watching as I sped away in the pouring rain.

The rest of the night was a blur.

My stab wound was apparently much worse than I thought. I lost a lot of blood, and had to be hospitalized. The police eventually cleared me as a suspect, but there were still a few on the force that weren’t convinced. The police discovered four bodies, and conducted a thorough sweep of the woods, but found no trace of our attacker. It wasn’t in the official report, but the bodies were supposedly found seated around the campfire, held in upright life-like poses with an intricate entanglement of barbed wiring. Circumstantially, the evidence was there, but police had nothing physical to officially declare these killings were the work of Landry Danes.

I want to say this was my only encounter with Wireface. However, it’s not where my story ends. Although I barely escaped being one of Wireface’s first victims, it was unbeknownst to me that his reign of terror had only begun.
