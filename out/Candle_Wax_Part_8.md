The next few hours were a blur. I told Gray to leave, but he stayed until the ambulance took me. The paramedics got to work removing the tacks one by one and it was torture. I was concussed, my orbital bone was fractured, and my nose was broken. They had my head wrapped up in all kinds of bandages and supports. Gray checked up on me early the next morning.

 

“Remember a couple days ago when I said you looked like roadkill? Yeah I take it back.” He barbed. I let out a groan.

 

“How are you holdin’ up, partner?” He asked in earnest.

 

“They said I can be out in 48 hours. What happened to Evelyn?”

 

Gray’s smiling façade dropped. “It’s bad... I was on the road coming to see you when a new post showed up Harmony’s socials. It quickly got deleted, but enough people saw it and called in. We got it saved.”

 

“Show me.”

 

Gray gave an apprehensive look, but obliged. He pulled out his phone and held it out to me. “It’s two images, here’s the first.”

 

If I had more control of my body, I would’ve physically recoiled. A candid shot of Evelyn, laying dead on the floor of her living room. There were pools of blood. She had been stabbed countless times.

 

I didn’t have time to process it before Gray swiped to the second photo... Harmony. The ghoulish, emaciated, eyeless Harmony. Posed up like any of her usual selfies, brandishing a bloody kitchen knife between her teeth... My heart shattered.

 

“We went to the house... it’s legit.” Gray explained.

 

“Harmony didn’t do this, Gray.” I insisted.

 

“I know you don’t want to believe that but...”

 

“She didn’t do it.” I interrupted. “That isn’t her. That’s some fucking... thing... using her body. Fuck. That’s why the video data was inconclusive, Gray. They didn’t AI generate videos of her, they didn’t have to, they had her body. They had that thing parade around in it and pretend to be her. The only thing they had to generate was the background and a filter to fix her fucking eye.”

 

“Okay, slow down. Even if you’re right, that’s not gonna play in court. You know that.”

 

“I don’t care about that. Not right now... This is bad... This is so much worse than you know.”

 

“What do you mean?”

 

“They played this game for months. These fake videos. Fake posts. Now they’re revealing their hand. Now they’re attacking. They killed Evelyn and made it a scene. They tried to kill me. They’ll probably try to kill you... They didn’t make those videos to get away with what they’d done. They knew eventually we would figure it out. No. They made those videos to bide themselves time... And now they don’t need them anymore. Why wouldn’t they need them anymore?”

 

“...Because it’s done. Whatever they were doing... They finished it.” Gray deduced.

 

“Exactly. It’s done. Just like Whitley said. Whatever it was, we were too late to stop it. Now it doesn’t matter. It’s here. It’s happening.”

 

“...No.” Gray mused. “No, that’s not true. If they were truly done, if they truly completed their mission, why would they bother trying to take you out? Evelyn was a scene, Evelyn was a victory lap... but they did that at the same time they came for you. Meaning they thought you would be dead. They need you to be dead... That means it’s not over. You are still a threat to them.”

 

“I don’t feel like much of a threat.”

 

“You must be close to something. Maybe it’s your connection with that girl, I don’t know. But I think we can still stop this... I’m gonna follow up on Father Whitley and deal with Evelyn as much as I can. With this being a homicide now, we got all kinds of shit stirred up and folks coming in from everywhere, it fuckin’ sucks. I’ll come back tomorrow. You focus on what you know. Try and make sense of this. See if you remember anything about the guy who attacked you.”

 

As soon as he said that, it all came to me. I did remember another detail about the man who attacked me... and it all fit into place.

 

“Holy shit.” I exclaimed.

 

“What?”

 

“I know who it was. I saw their eyes... They had HER eyes.”

 

“What do you mean?”

 

“Harmony, she has these piercing blue eyes. Sky blue. It’s almost uncanny. But Evelyn had hazel eyes... Harmony didn’t get them from her. This man’s eyes... they were Harmony’s.”

 

“So, Harmony’s father? What was his name, Brad? But we confirmed he was in Alberta. Other side of the country.”

 

“How did we confirm that? We never took him seriously as a suspect because at the time we didn’t even know there was a suspect, we didn’t know anything. We didn’t dig. We called him once and looked at his fucking social media and we bought it, just like we bought Harmony’s. If he faked her, why wouldn’t he fake himself? No. Harmony was never in Paris, and Harmony’s father was never in Alberta.”

 

“Shit. Okay, you might be right. But you don’t know it was him, you’re just saying it COULD have been him.”

 

“It was him... It all adds up. Father Whitley, Harmony’s father, ‘The Church of the Father’. Its always been The Father. Whitley even said it: “She was our lamb from the beginning.” Harmony was born for this. She was groomed by her dad and Whitley for this purpose. She drank from the chalice at that nursery school. She was probably fucking baptized with it. Whatever they did to her was changing her. Her headaches. Her premonitions. She could see more than reality. She projected herself into my dreams. The other attempts failed because they were only human... she was becoming...”

 

“Whoa, slow down Cole. You’re saying a lotta shit right now that I don’t understand.”

 

I ignored him and continued thinking out loud. “For what? What were they preparing her for? What is she now? A host? A vessel? Is that it? Were they just... making her more habitable for some other entity? But what about the wax?”

 

Gray cut me off again, “Okay, okay, easy now. I know I said try and make sense of all this but remember you have serious fucking head trauma. Simmer on it, alright? Don’t boil over. Rest. You’re here for two days, alright?”

 

“I can’t stay here for two days. We don’t have time. We’re already too late.”

 

“You’re staying here. I don’t care. I got this.”

 

“No, Gray, I need to get out of here.” I said as I began to sit up in my bed.

 

“Cole if you don’t lay your pin cushion ass back down right now, I will shoot you in the face.”

 

“Jesus... Fine.” I said slowly laying back down.

 

“I’ll be back, alright? I gotta go play politician and try and not let some fancy pants from Vancouver steal this case from us and fuck everything up. I’ll be fighting for my life out there... well, so to speak. I’ll look into Harmony’s pops as well. We’ll talk soon.”

 

“Be careful, Gray. They might be coming for you too.”

 

“Oh don’t you go worryin’ about me now.” He said with a smirk before leaving.

 

The silence of his absence was immediately unwelcome. I hated hospitals. I hated the smells. I hated the fluorescent lights. I hated the impersonal, clinical white walls. I hated the little beeps of machinery... I spent too much time in places like this. Whether for myself or for someone else. All I could ever think was “I hope I don’t die in a place like this. Anywhere else. Anywhere else.”

 

I lived in my thoughts for the rest of the day. I didn’t notice much going on around me. Everything the doctors and nurses said was in one ear, out the other. I just wanted to leave... and I just wanted to sleep, but my body wouldn’t allow it. Maybe it was afraid, maybe it was right to be.

 

As the lights dimmed at the end of the day, sleep was beginning to win the battle. I drifted off, wondering if I would see Harmony again. What must she be going through? I had a feeling I knew what she saw at the end of the last dream...

 

I was back on the beach, except now it was empty. The sun had set over the horizon. It was cold, and I felt so deeply, unbearably alone.

 

But as I looked out to the water, I saw a figure standing in it up to their waist. I walked into the water after them. As I got closer, even though she was turned away from me, I could see it was her.

 

“Harmony!” I called out, to no response.

 

As I got within feet of her, I could hear something amongst the crashing of waves. She was whispering to herself. It didn’t seem like words at first. It sounded like someone tuning a radio.

 

“Harmony. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” She still didn’t move or acknowledge me.

 

“Kill... Kill... Someone...” Those words came through her jumbled-up whispers and repeated over and over. “Me... I... Someone Else...”

 

I got up close to hear her better. After a minute of the cryptic susurrate, I got the full picture.

 

“Kill me before I kill someone else. Kill me before I kill someone else. Kill me before I kill someone else...” I looked into her eyes and they were full of tears.

 

I reached out and pulled her into a tight embrace. “I’m sorry.” I pleaded. Her body still didn’t move or respond. She just looped that phrase again and again.

 

“I’m gonna fix this. I promise. I’m gonna bring you home.” I asserted, trying unsuccessfully not to burst into tears of my own.

 

“There will be no home.” She whispered. I released my embrace to look at her, but it wasn’t her anymore. It was the other her. Grinning at me the most sadistic grin. “The Father may yet have you too.”

 

My body went limp and I began to collapse, but she caught me just before I hit the water. Delicately, she laid my head back and dipped me down like a ballroom dance. The water wasn’t water anymore. It was warmer and thicker. As my eyes sank below the surface, I could only see red.

 

After a few seconds, she brought me back up. Now the sky was red too.

 

The twisted version of Harmony leaned in close to my ear and whispered. “Feed him.”

 

My eyes turned to the dark, crimson shoreline. So far away, but I could see something lurching towards the water. A naked, pale human figure. I couldn’t make out any details but it looked like it was struggling to move. More than that, it looked like it was struggling to maintain its shape.

 

“Don’t!” Harmony’s voice pleaded to me. I looked towards her and she had returned to her normal self. “Don’t feed it! Don’t look at it!”

 

“What is it!?” I cried.

 

“He can’t wear skin! But he needs a brain! He’s nothing now, but he will be soon! It’s all for him! It’s all for him!”

 

“What are you talking about!? That doesn’t make any sense!”

 

“The window is open, and he feeds. He’ll show you, but don’t look. Not with your eyes, not with your mind. Not with the window to our soul. I am him, he is me, but he will be more. I am an infection of his design. I serve. I obey. He feeds from me to become whole. For he has made me more than human. But my skin is only skin.”

 

She sounded like Melvin. She sounded like that strange old lady. I couldn’t make sense of her words, but I was suddenly distracted by a sloshing in the bloody lake, and I turned my gaze to meet it. The figure was gone from the shore. I saw only a ripple in its wake. It was under the surface. It was under me. I turned back to Harmony and she was gone. I was alone.

 

I heard it moving. I felt a current pass by my legs. I was begging myself to wake up but I couldn’t.

 

A hand roughly grabbed my ankle and pulled me down. I fell into the thick, warm crimson. Another hand grabbed my other ankle. Then two more hands grabbed each of my wrists. They began pulling in all directions while I scrambled for breath under the surface. Blood was already making it down my throat and choking me. I couldn’t see anything but deep red.

 

They pulled and pulled and wouldn’t stop. I felt my left shoulder pop out of socket. Then my right. My femurs struggled to remain in my hip joints. The pulling wouldn’t stop. More hands emerged from the sea of viscera and pulled at my ribcage and my jaw. Forcing my mouth open to accept the endless rush of blood, then ripping my jaw off entirely. I felt holes appear in my skin where it had been pulled and stretched too far, then a sudden and violent pop when my pelvis broke in half. Still they kept pulling. From that point on it was like a zipper being unzipped right up the middle of me. I felt my innards float away to the surface.

 

Finally, two more hands plunged deep into my eye sockets and pulled each way. My skull cracked in half like an egg. That one final snap was enough to wake me.

 

The hospital room was dark and quiet. It was still early in the night... I wanted to scream in anguish. I couldn’t take this anymore. I just wanted to sleep. Was it too much to ask to just sleep through the night? Just one night?

 

My body and my mind were at war with one another. My body wanted to go back to sleep, but the deep, lingering fear wouldn’t allow it. So I laid there in a nowhere state. Helpless and alone in my own personal hell.

 

I heard a stirring in one of the beds in the room across from me. It sounded a bit more significant than the usual creaking of the mattress springs. Any other time I wouldn’t bother looking, but I was in a permanent state of anxiety, so I slowly turned my head.

 

The room was dark, darker than mine, but I could see the figure of someone sitting up in their bed. I could see the faintest glint in their eyes. They were looking at me.

 

They turned their body towards me and hung their legs over the side of the bed. Then they stood up and began shambling towards the threshold.

 

I could see him better now and... I recognized him. I saw him outside the soup kitchen that first day. When this all started. He was nice to me.

 

As he got closer, I could see a glaze had fallen over his eyes. Along with a deep sorrow. I don’t know how I knew, but I knew he was going to kill me.

 

“Forgive me.” He croaked as he pulled himself to my bedside.

 

“Don’t do this.” I begged, but his hands had already made their way around my throat and began to squeeze. I felt the veins in my head thickening.

 

There was anguish in his face. He turned away while he choked me, and held his body at arms length, not being able to bear what he was doing. Fortunately, that gave me an opening.

 

I wrestled one of my legs between his arms and smashed his nose with my heel. He released his grip and stumbled back to the floor.

 

As I coughed and tried to catch my breath, I pressed every alert and knocked a bunch of shit over, making as much noise as possible. He got back to his feet, and I struggled to mine.

 

“Why are you doing this?” I yelled through a raspy voice.

 

“You have to... You have to...” He cried before rushing at me.

 

I didn’t have the strength to get my hands up in time and he tackled me to the ground. Now his desperation had outweighed his trepidation. He had me in a full mount and looked directly into my eyes as he squeezed the life out of me. I struggled and punched as much as I could, but I could feel myself fading fast.

 

The next 30 seconds were chaos. I didn’t see most of it. But I heard footsteps rushing to the door. I heard yelling. Someone pulled him off of me. More yelling, and then the loud pop of a gunshot plunged everything into silence. The man dropped right in front of me. I stared into his eyes as all life left them.

 

The orderlies got me back into bed and stayed close, tending to me kindly. Gray arrived at the hospital within the hour. I heard his shouting voice echo through the corridors from far away. He was heated. Eventually he arrived at my door.

 

“Y’know I TOLD them to beef up security, right? I told them that. I told them to get some more cops in and to keep a close eye... I mean, an attempt on the life of a detective from a perp who’s still out there, you’d think maybe they would... fuckin’ hell.”

 

“It’s okay. I’m fine.”

 

“Course you are. Right as fuckin’ rain. Look at you. Unkillable. You’re like a cockroach.”

 

“Thanks?”

 

“Yeah, alright, listen... I’m getting you outta here. Let’s go.”

 

“Really?”

 

“Yeah! Oh they’re not happy about it, but fuck ‘em. You’re not safe here, so we’re breaking you out, partnah.”

 

“Where are we gonna go?”

 

“To the car... and then we’re gonna figure it out from there. Do they still have your bullet society shirt or whatever?”

 

“They cut it off.”

 

“Ah, shit. My bad. Alright well you look fine in your little gown, just keep the back clasped up. Let me get you a wheelchair.”

 

“I can walk.”

 

“Come on. Take the wheelchair. It’s fun.” He playfully insisted.

 

Gray wheeled me out of the hospital and I couldn’t have been more grateful. Whether he had a plan or not, I was just happy to feel the breeze on my face and see the stars. We got into his car, and I was even happy to be back there too.

 

We sat there in the parking lot for a minute. Both of us, silently contemplating our next move.

 

“Who was that guy? Guy who attacked you?” Gray asked.

 

“I don’t know... We saw him before, at the soup kitchen, just in passing. He seemed nice.”

 

“What was he then? Indoctrinated into the cult or whatever?”

 

“Maybe... Maybe it’s far worse than that.”

 

Gray clicked his tongue. “So where do we go now? I mean I could put you up for the night.”

 

“No... It’s not safe... We need to end this, Gray. We need to do it tonight.”

 

“Woman, you need rest. You need to sleep.”

 

“I can’t rest. I can’t. I’ve tried. The nightmares won’t stop. THEY won’t stop. There is no sleep, there is no rest, until this is done. One way or another.”

 

“One way or another... And what the hell do you mean by that?”

 

I shot him a solemn look. “You know what I mean, Gray.”

 

“No I don’t. And you don’t. We’re not talking about ‘another’. There is no ‘another’. You wanna do this tonight? Let’s do it. One way.”

 

“One way...” I’ll admit he fired me up a bit with that.

 

“So, where to?” He asked.

 

“First I need my clothes and my gun. Then we’re going to Blessings.”

 

“The soup kitchen?”

 

“Whitley ran it... Think about it, he doses Harmony with whatever the hell was in that chalice, turning her into some kind of... feeder. Then he opens a soup kitchen. Two guys who frequented that soup kitchen go crazy and attack me... The old lady probably did too. He’s been slowly infecting all of them.”

 

“Okay there’s some shit you’re saying that you need to fill me in on. A chalice?”

 

“I’ll explain later. Did you ever get an address on Harmony’s father?”

 

“No, there was nothing.”

 

“Yeah... I bet that’s where he’s been living.  Probably in the damn basement of the soup kitchen.”

 

“You think so?”

 

“Good way to keep low profile while he does his work.”

 

“Well then let me ask you this. If that’s the place, then why do we keep seeing Harmony out in the middle of the woods?”

 

“I don’t know... I mean they needed those goats for something... Their blood is probably part of the concoction. Those woods were the best place to lure them in. Their killing ground.”

 

Gray shook his head. “This is some gnarly shit... Okay... So what the hell is this about a chalice?”

 

We drove through the dark, empty roads, and I laid it all out to him as best as I could. I could tell he wanted to reject this superstitious nonsense, but he resisted the urge. I thanked him for that.

 

We parked outside of my building and cautiously made our way inside the crime scene of a unit. I grabbed some proper clothes, some hair pins, took some painkillers, and grabbed my gun. We were in and out in two minutes.

 

Before I got back in the car, I noticed a scraggly looking man on the other side of the road, illuminated in silhouette by the streetlight. He just stood and stared. I had to wonder if he was another one... Were they told to kill me, or was the idea implanted within them like a base instinct?

 

We got back on the road. My stomach began to knot. A sense of impending doom filled the air. This was it. The last stretch... One way.
