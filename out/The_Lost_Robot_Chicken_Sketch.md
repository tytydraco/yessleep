My friend Sarah and I share the same sense of humor. We both love to bond over shows like Family Guy and Always Sunny, for example. So when she told me that she'd never seen Robot Chicken before, I had to change that!

I had just bought the then brand new Season 5 DVD the same day it was released. I was planning on having a night where I bingewatched all these new episodes by myself, but I invited Sarah to watch it with me and she happilly accepted my invitation.

We ordered Chinese food and had our own little watch party. We spent hours laughing at jokes about Skeletor renting out Snake Mountain to a bunch of frat boys and Cookie Monster fighting Keebler Elves. There was, however, one sketch in particular that made us both very uncomfortable. It was unlike anything else that the show has ever done.

The sketch took place in a child's bedroom. It began with a young boy sleeping in his bed, when a monster slowly crept out from under it. Sarah and I looked at each other in utter shock when the monster's appearance was revealed. It lacked the cartoonish style that every other Robot Chicken character has and appeared to have come straight out of a horror movie.

The beast resembled a large pink rabbit with yellow eyes, huge fangs, bat wings, and sharp claws. The creature then let out an ear-piercing shriek. Sarah is prone to migraines so I asked her if she wanted me to fast forward through this particular sketch. She declined and we kept on watching.

The bunny monster then proceeded to grab the young child and forcefully shove him under his bed kicking and screaming. The boy's terrified screams were heard as the camera panned out.

The child's mom then walked into her son's room, concerned about the noise she just heard only to see her young boy's bloody corpse lying on the ground. The mom was voiced by Mila Kunis, who sounded genuinely devastated in this scene. The voice acting was almost uncanny in it's realism.

After sobbing, the mom pulled out a gun and shot herself. In an almost inappropriately drastic switch, the next sketch was a silly Star Trek parody where the enterprise crew lost power and resorted to making noises instead.

Sarah and I were both shocked at the scene we just witnessed. We weren't scared or anything, but we were still surprised that a comedy show like Robot Chicken would air something so blatantly unfunny and downright gruesome like that. They weren't even attempting dark humor!

That one strange sketch didn't ruin our night, though. We continued the marathon as usual and still had a wonderful time.

Sarah has since become an even bigger Robot Chicken fan than I am. She'll throw out ridiculously obscure quotes and trivia on a regular basis. It's become one of our favorite things to bond over.

We even got to meet the crew at Comic-Con one year. During the meet and greet, Sarah asked them about the bunny sketch. Head writer, Breckin Meyer explained that he was the one behind it.

He wanted to do something experimental for the milestone 5th season. He thought it would be fun to write a horror sketch completely devoid of jokes. The higher ups at Adult Swim, however, weren't too keen on Breckin's idea and forced him to scrap it. They were afraid that viewers would find the drastically different tone jarring. Breckin fought tooth and nail to air the sketch, but his bosses stubbornly turned him down each time.

So he attempted to sneak it onto the season 5 DVD. A day after it's initial release, Mike Lazzo (the former president of Adult Swim) caught on to Breckin's stunt and removed the scary sketch from all future releases.
