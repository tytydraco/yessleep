This is my best attempt of following up to your question: u/Anglophile007. (I wrote this to keep track of my symptoms on a cheap route planner I never used in two years)

I have always felt safer in the comforts of the dark—never really understood what people meant by “night=danger”. It’s really “night=whole other truth”. The night is another realm for those who are like me—welcomes those that the daylight distrusts—and I feel like I have found a second home. My dependence on the dark has also gotten worse.

I haven’t received a new route yet. I think they’re waiting to see if I ask for it. I understand that my little excursion hasn’t been excused—“replacing employees is easier than replacing trust,” they’ve said—but I’m going through so much withdrawal and I can’t take it anymore. 

I haven’t left my apartment in weeks, and my curtains are always too thin. It’s like I hate everything that the harsh daylight has touched, and when my sister visited yesterday, I flinched from the resting heat of her face. She looked like I had just slapped her. I couldn’t even bear to look at the pink flush on her cheeks. It goes without saying that all the money that’s been sustaining my hermit lifestyle is now depleted.

Worst of all is the hunger I feel. It doesn’t matter how many times I order meals—the delivery man thinks I want to sleep with him now—because it will always leave me puking every bite on my sorry toilet. My meals have gotten progressively more carnivorous, and I’m starting to think maybe I was looking for a part of them. I still so desperately craved their presence, what they had done to me that night.

My floor was a plethora of empty takeout boxes and the other remains of my earthly rot. The couch sags where I’ve molded it into a nest, and the air smells like something died in the walls and refuses to admit it. I don’t know where the mess ends and I begin.

Yesterday night I mustered up the courage to step out in the night again. I could feel the life come back to my face, and the eerie calm sweep over me. I walked and walked and found myself at a butcher shop. I didn’t know the directions to this place, I don’t understand how I could have gone. My body is taking me to places I’ve never been before.

I asked the butcher if he sold organ meat. I think I needed the vitality and level of finalness they could take from the victim if removed. He looked at me with the same funny expression my sister gave me—a silent scream for help, “this woman is batshit crazy”—and I did not look away from him. When he understood that I was serious, he eventually surrendered and gave me a cow’s liver—they’d “have thrown it away anyways, and better it went to the stomach for it”—and I could feel my stomach growl.

It’s like my body was on autopilot and started things I hadn’t thought of. I was a passenger looking at my own doom unfolding. Maybe I wasn’t in control of this. Maybe it’s that night, still sending out its tendrils and making me into a creature that truly belongs to the night.
 
And maybe this raunchy slab of raw meat and viscous blood isn’t really my appetite speaking—I just need something to connect me with them. I don’t understand if that night has become a part of me more than I have become its part.

I have been touched by the dark, and I don’t know when or how the transformation happened—but it feels like it’s always been brewing. Ever since I was born.
