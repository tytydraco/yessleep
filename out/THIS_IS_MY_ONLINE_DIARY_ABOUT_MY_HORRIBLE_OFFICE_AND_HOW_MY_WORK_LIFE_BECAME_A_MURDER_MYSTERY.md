To my bosses:

I’m quitting work.

I’m quitting work before my office is a shitshow.

I’m quitting work because four days ago, my acting manager murdered my coworker in front of me ,and went in his office and laughed about it, and no one blinked a eye.

The coworker’s name was Alan. Anywhere you went and asked, someone would say, *oh Alan–he can’t keep a ledger to save his life*. Well, Alan was a living human being with two kids and an on-again-off-again wife!

*AND THE WORST PART OF ALL OF THIS IS HIS CUBICLE WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF MINE!*

Now Alan was decently tall. I could see his head in my peripheral vision even if I was looking at my computer, and our cubicles certainly weren’t soundproof, which meant I could hear every conversation he was having with Miss Lisa Gooding, who was in college studying English. I didn’t want to hear any of it. But it also meant I saw when another head popped into his cubicle, and I could hear the brutal pop of something sharp being driven into his skin. I can still hear his first yell in front of me, and all of the yells after when my manager dragged him out of his chair and all the way back to his office, where he forgot to shut the blinds.

I couldn’t move my head away from it, so I got an excruciating view of poor Alan getting murdered, then butchered, then quite literally disemboweled and crammed into a tiny fridge.

I’m quitting work because I think my acting manager is a cannibal.

*NO ONE NOTICED.*

I got up and screamed and everyone looked at me like I was crazy. Monica at the reception desk just popped her gum and asked *sugar, are you feeling okay?*

I just laughed hysterically and said I needed an off day. I haven’t been back since, but I left my wallet and my computer and a shoe there, fuck me.

How the fuck didn’t any of them see Alan get murdered? That was my biggest question, and for a night and a day, I didn’t think about any of it. I ate and ate and gained like ten pounds, and then the next day I thought about it all and wanted to throw up. Was Alan invisible to them? Did they all get threatened by my boss to keep quiet? Were they also secret cannibals?

*NOTHING IS OUT OF THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY.*

But I called the police, and told them everything, and I don’t know, they must have gone and checked and made a ruckus out of everything, because I got a stern email that was forwarded to all, saying an anonymous caller had made an accusation of murder against an employee and how bad that was and how it disrupted the workplace.

Fuck management. Did the literal murder not disrupt the workplace?

Anyhow, I got a call from the police later yesterday, where they berated me for apparently lying to them. According to them, no one named Alan existed with the record of that last name, in the company or otherwise. And they’d done some weird scans to look for blood or a body or whatnot–didn’t find anything.

So now I was thinking, man, *fuck me*. Did I imagine all this? Did I have countless conversations with a man I had dreamt up?

But I got a call from Alan’s on-again-off-again wife, who seemed angry that her husband hadn’t come to pick up his children from school the other day, and I told her I didn’t have a clue and hung up, because how do I tell a lady who crotch-punched me for drinking her wine on accident once that I think I saw her husband get murdered but I’m not sure because the police couldn’t find anything about it? She’d murder me, and then set my house on fire to boot.

I felt bad, though, so I called back, got left on voicemail, and babbled all my suspicions anyways. We’ll see what comes of it. I hope it’s not my house getting caught on fire.

I am not quitting.

I’m typing this part of the account out because my acting manager just Venmoed me fifty thousand fucking dollars as hush money. I don’t know how he knows I know, aside from me freaking out five minutes after he killed my friend and having the police search his workplace and make him the target of an investigation. He might as well have put the caption **KEEP QUIET OR YOU’RE NEXT** on the transaction.

Here’s the thing: Alan’s murder has fucked up my brain. I know what I saw. I don’t know why everyone else didn’t react, or why the police couldn’t find anything, but I know what I saw. When he was getting stabbed, he looked right at me, and I don’t know why I didn’t get up.

For the rest of my life, I won’t know why, but he had already been stabbed through the gut so much that he would’ve died, and I know that if I had gotten up, the same unblinking coworkers would’ve chattered on their computers as I got disemboweled next to him.

So really, I know why I didn’t get up and help. I just don’t like the fact that I’m a coward.

The money, though.  Any severance pay I would have gotten would’ve been measly compared to this. This is a year’s worth of pay, and if I go back to work and find out more weird shit about the manager, maybe I can get him convicted. For that, I can afford to be scared shitless for eight hours a day five times a week.

Plus, I feel like there have been other weird incidents in my office, now that I think about it all. Things that are maybe in the back of my head that I could remember if I have enough time. If I do, I’ll update this.
