I'm a 29-year-old office worker living in a 10-floor apartment in Seoul. What happened last Tuesday still haunts me - and I don't mean that figuratively.  

It started when I worked late finishing a project. Stepping out at 1 AM, I noticed the sky had this unnatural reddish tint, like the whole city was bathed in emergency light. I blamed my tired eyes and headed home.  

My building's ancient elevator always groans like it might give out, but that night it felt different. The lobby lights were flickering, and the security desk was unmanned - strange because old man Kim always works nights.  

The doors opened with that familiar ding. I stepped in and pressed 10. Nothing happened. I pressed again. Then the doors slammed shut on their own and we started moving up.  

1... 2... 3...  

At the 4th floor, the lights buzzed and dimmed. The temperature dropped so suddenly I could see my breath. That's when I noticed it - a new button labeled "B5" that definitely wasn't there before.  

Before I could react, the elevator jerked to a stop.  

The display read: 15.  

My building only has 10 floors.  

The doors creaked open to reveal a hallway I'd never seen - peeling wallpaper, water stains on the ceiling. At the far end stood a little girl in a red dress, her back to me.  

"Hello?" My voice echoed. "Are you lost?"  

She turned slowly.  

Her dress wasn't red - it was white and soaked with something dark. Where her eyes should have been were just... empty sockets. But the worst part was her mouth - stretched into an impossibly wide smile.  

"Uncle," she whispered, though her lips didn't move, "will you play with me?"  

I smashed the close door button. The girl dropped to all fours and scuttled toward me with jerky, unnatural movements.  

The doors closed just as she reached them. Through the narrowing gap, I saw her fingers grasping - then CRUNCH. The doors crushed her hand. A shrill scream pierced the air as she yanked back, leaving three twitching fingers on the elevator floor.  

The elevator suddenly plunged downward. I fell to my knees as the display spun wildly: 8... 3... B1... then back to 15.  

When it stopped, the doors opened to the same hallway - but now the walls were covered in old family photos where every face had been scratched out.  

This time when the doors closed, the elevator went to the 7th floor. My neighbor Mr. Jung stood there with his garbage, seemingly waiting.  

"Mr. Jung! Thank God! The elevator is--"  

He turned.  

Where his face should have been was just smooth, blank skin.  

He pointed behind me.  

I turned to see the elevator mirror - but my reflection wasn't mine. It was a woman with a broken neck, her mouth slit ear to ear like the girl's.  

When I looked back, Mr. Jung was gone.  

The doors closed. The elevator rose to my floor.  

But when I entered my apartment, it wasn't mine. The walls were covered in handprints - dark, wet handprints. Furniture was overturned. And in the center of the living room knelt the girl, her back to me, shoulders shaking like she was crying.  

I backed out and fled back to the elevator.  

This time when I pressed 1, the descent felt normal. The lobby doors opened to reveal... complete decay. Like the building had been abandoned for years. Through the front doors, that same blood-red sky pulsed.  

Then I noticed the elevator mirror again. The broken-necked woman was still there, watching me.  

I don't know how I got home that night. I woke up in my own bed at 6 AM, my clothes soaked with sweat but otherwise normal.  

But sometimes at night, I hear the elevator running when no one's there. And last night, I found three small fingerprints on my bathroom mirror - in what looks like dried blood.  

The super says no little girls live in our building.
