The other night, I was at a house party when disaster struck. We had run out of beer.

I was seemingly the soberest out of my group of friends (who had all devolved into shirtless maniacs doing their best WWE impressions as they jumped off of tables into one another) and decided I was going to be the one to go on the holy crusade that is the beer run.

We're all in our early twenties and the two twenty-four packs of beer we had bought just a few hours earlier had all been thrown up or pissed out. Did we need more beer? No. Did we want it? Hell yes.

I was still a little wobbly and knew that driving was out of the question. Although I probably could have managed it, even my drunk brain knew was a bad idea. My friends house was in a quiet forested area just outside of the town where I lived, and the only way back was the road, or a shortcut by trail.

The road was the safer option as there were less chances I would run into a bear or something, but the night was dragging on and the liquor store would close soon if I didn't hurry up. I knew taking the trail would shave off a good twenty minutes so I grabbed a flashlight and my jacket then headed out the door, and down the old dirt trail.

The pleasant warm breeze that had accompanied me as I left the house vanished and the temperature dropped a few degrees as I strolled down the path. It was like stepping out of summer and into fall in real time and I was glad to have my jacket wrapped around me tightly like a reassuring hug.

The gigantic trees loomed into each other at the tops, creating a canopy of darkness over the path with only a pin point of light I could see far down at the other side that was the town. I could feel my buzz wearing off as I walked and emotions like fear began creeping back into my consciousness.

It was almost pitch black now and I flipped on my flashlight as I began thinking about bears or whatever else I could bump into out here, then at the exact same time, I saw another flashlight flicker to life somewhere down the trail.

It was kind of weird, because there were all the reasons to head *into* town, but heading out this way? There were only a couple other houses by my friends that seemed to be inhabited by retirees with lawn ornament obsessions, and I doubted they had the youthful energy to be doing a beer run themselves. Nevertheless, I continued walking, with only the sounds of my footsteps and blood in my ears to keep me company with my new acquaintance.

I could make out a silhouette of the stranger now, he appeared to be my height, but my flashlight wasn't the strongest and there wasn't much for the weak beam of light to bounce off of in the darkness.

Me and the stranger probably had thirty or so feet between us now and we were both walking in the middle of the path. I stepped to the right to make room for the man... and he stepped right too.

I could feel my heart rate picking up as we got closer and closer, I stepped to the left and the stranger did too, closer and closer, I stepped right again and the man mimicked me without pause, then I stopped.

There was maybe 12 feet between us now. I took a step back. And so did the man. I shined my flashlight at his feet, he however, didn’t copy me. I noticed we were wearing the same adidas sneakers. I started to slowly raise my flashlight and realized we were wearing the exact same outfit, but he was filthy, like he had been buried for a few days then dug up.

With a shaking hand, I slowly raised the flashlight to his face and… kind of blanked out. I had never felt fear so cold and blunt. It was like somebody had ran a bath filled with every nightmare I had ever had in my life, then held my head under the water.

I was staring back at myself. My face. Even the little scar on my chin I had gotten from falling into my parents coffee table as a kid was there.  But this wasn't me, it *couldn't* be me.

There were thin purple veins all over his face, pulsating in waves like tiny troops of ants were making their rounds under his skin. His grinning mouth was just a little too big and held just a few teeth too many, like there was another set hiding behind the original like a sharks.

But the worst part were his eyes. Or maybe lack of. There were cold, vanta-black tar pits where my own light blue irises should have been. I was lost for a moment just staring into those lifeless voids when I heard a *click*.

And my flashlight shut off...

His was still on, I could still see his feet firmly on the ground, waiting like we were in a game of chess and it was my move.

Slowly, he started to turn the flashlight up towards his chin like one does when telling a story around a campfire, and clicked it off.

Silence filled the air, I very slowly began to turn around when the fucking thing shrieked and I heard it lunging towards me. I screamed too and began to sprint as fast as I could down the trail back towards my friends house in the dark. At one point I tripped and twisted my ankle pretty bad but I caught myself mid fall and the adrenaline masked the pain just enough to keep going.

I didn't stop running nor did I look back until I got inside my friends house. I was in hysterics and crying. My friends turned the music off and gathered around to ask me what had happened. However, their concern quickly turned into laughter and ridicule when I told them what I saw in the woods.

"Who shared the joint with this guy earlier? He clearly can't handle his weed!" One of my friends said as the room erupted into a fit of laughter.

They all thought I was kidding, or crazy. But I know what I saw. I don't know what it was, but I know what happened was real.

I'm losing sleep over this, and last night I woke up and could feel something nagging at me to look out my apartment window. And when I did, I could have sworn I saw myself at a bus stop a couple blocks away, staring back.
