That’s what this dude told me [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1j57q1z/the_latest_scam_on_discord_is_deadly/) right before I accepted his friend request.

I’m in a Lyft with Boo the cat, who I rescued from the apartment of Lucia, one of the latest people to disappear after being friended by this guy on Discord.

Lucia is dead. I’m next. Here’s what I know:

Anyone who accepts his friend request hears a knocking at their door. The knocking follows them. *Everywhere.* As in, it shows up at other doors. Every door. It’s not a normal knocking. And as soon as you open the door, you disappear.

At least, that’s what this Discord guy, Tim, told me when he hired me to find out what’s going on. See, Tim doesn’t know who’s behind the knocking, either. He claims that every time he tries to chat with a person, within about five minutes, they type *brb* or *hang on a sec* and then… they ghost him. Personally, I have to think there’s more to his role in this than just some innocent guy who can’t keep a conversation going because people keep exiting. When I agreed to investigate for him, I had him send me all the chat histories with the people who’ve friended him over the past two weeks and disappeared, and the first person I ID’d from the chats was Lucia.

So that’s how I wound up in the lower level of a duplex snooping around an empty apartment while a cat screamed at me. I finally checked where Boo the cat kept meowing and looking, which was under the bed.

I cannot unsee her. Lucia’s dead, screaming face will be in my nightmares for the rest of my life.

… which might not be that long, since I’m hearing the knocking, now, too. Been hearing it since chatting with Tim this morning. And unless I can solve this thing, my next update will be my obit.

\*\*\*

After the Lyft drops me back at home, I climb back into my basement office with Boo (through the egress window since I can’t use doors), releasing the cat to hide under the sofa. Then I pull up the list of Discord usernames Tim gave me. Eight missing people, but I’ve only managed to confirm the deaths of two of them: Lucia and Quentin, a boomer whose recent birthday will now be a funeral since a neighbor found him tucked in his closet.

*“His mouth was open in a scream.* *The way his eyes were bulged out—I’ll never forget it.”*

Those were his neighbor’s words describing him. Same way I found Lucia. Same way I’ll probably be found.

The thing about the supernatural is, there are always rules, they’re just not the same ones we’re used to governing our world. The trick to surviving is figuring out a particular entity’s playbook before it takes your life. So. Based on the fact that Lucia, Quentin, and I all live in the same geographic area, one of the rules of this KNOCK KNOCK entity is range. The knocker’s influence in the physical world is restricted by distance. And this here is the key point—it’s restricted by distance… but distance from *what?*

I check Tim’s IP address, compare his location to Quentin and Lucia and me, and lo and behold, he’s smack dab in the middle of us. The center around which we all turn.

Either he’s the knocker, or he’s its first victim.

Next, I run some searches through local news using what I’ve learned about the deaths so far. And boom—another victim:

*TEEN PRANK ENDS IN TRAGEDY*

*Questions linger in the death of a 15-year-old boy who disappeared after what police described as a prank gone wrong. According to authorities, Dwayne and two other teenaged boys were livestreaming their reactions to a Discord server where people describe supernatural encounters. The teens told police that Dwayne was spooked by a story of a ghostly entity knocking on a door. In a video that has since gone viral, Dwayne can be seen opening the door, screaming and running from the room. He was later found unresponsive in the crawl space beneath the house and was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities suspect his death to be from natural causes, but an autopsy is pending.*

And now, my pulse ratchets up, perspiration beading on my forehead because—a viral video? My fingers fly across the keys. One of Dwayne’s friends posted it and removed it, but nothing posted is ever truly gone if you know how to search. And there—got it! Dwayne’s reaction to the “prank.”

It doesn’t show his actual death of course. No—it shows a moment that, from my perspective, is even more important.

I’m about to watch him open the door.

\*\*\*

Three teens crowd the screen.

“Yo yo yo check this,” says one, braces glinting as he flashes a cocky smile.

“Wait, bro, show the screen!” crows another, seizing the camera. Blurry footage as the lens zooms in on a laptop with a Discord chat up. Then the view pans back to the teen with the silver smile, narrating, explaining they’re about to debunk this supernatural bullshit while the second teen aims the camera at him. Laughter from both. And then the view panning to the third, sitting by the laptop. He waves. Shy smile. Pushes his glasses awkwardly up the bridge of his nose. And my heart sinks because I know what happens to him. This sweet, nerdy kid. He’s toast.

The wannabe influencer with the silver smile says, “This my man Dwayne, he’s checking out these scary stories. Supposedly in the next five minutes we’re gonna hear a knocking—”

*Thud thud thud!*

The camera jumps, and there’s a chorus of “holy shit’s” and then a deep baritone voice calls out, “Everything OK in there?” A chubby middle-aged guy with glasses pokes his head into the room, and the boys groan because “We’re recording!!!” and he backs out and shuts the door.

Wannabe Influencer and Camera Boy argue about whether to keep recording or restart. Meanwhile, half out-of-view, Dwayne cocks his head like a golden retriever. His eyes dart to the door. “Can’t you hear it?” he asks. He keeps repeating himself louder until Camera Boy focuses on him and he adds, “Seriously, you can’t hear that?”

“Hear what?” It’s unclear who asks this.

All three fall to arguing, talking over each other.

“Yo, he’s bullshitting.”

“Just open it, bro!”

“HOW can you not hear that? It’s so fucking loud!”

“He’s really scared!” laughs someone—I think it’s Wannabe Influencer.

We’re about four minutes in and I’m at the edge of my seat. *Don’t open the door!* I silently will the trio. As if it weren’t a done deal. As if there were any hope for this poor fucking kid. The others keep ribbing him, and he shrills, “Why don’t *you* open it then?” I feel his panic because I hear the same knocking right now from the door at the top of the basement stairs—KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK—an incessant drumbeat out of sync with my galloping heart. The other two tell him to quit being such a pussy. “Look at him, crying like a little girl!” They mock and jeer.

Dwayne can’t take it anymore and stands up.

My heart rages. I don’t wanna see this next part.

He grips the knob. His buddies hoot and holler as Dwayne straightens his back—and flings the door wide.

The shrill scream that erupts from my laptop all but shatters the speakers. In that moment, Dwayne is not a teenager. He’s a child, his terrified wail piercing my eardrums. It lasts only a couple seconds—that shriek, and the camera dropping. Black screen. Then the camera snatched up again and Dwayne is gone—a blur sprinting out of the room—and the view ends on a pair of sliding doors, one flung open to the wintry porch.

… I’m staring at a blank screen.

The video is over.

I rewind. Pause, and playback the moment he opens the door. Freeze it, and advance frame by frame until I have a clear view of the open door just after the camera is picked up.

I stare. I stare and stare, numb with shock and horror and a sort of directionless rage.

There is nothing visible in the doorframe.

I’m no closer now than I was early this morning to figuring out how to beat this thing.

I message Tim.

\*\*\*

TIM: What do u mean they die? how do they die?

ME: They die of fear, man. Of total fucking terror.

TIM: oh no no no no no this is so messed up what is happening

ME: \[video\]

TIM: oh jesus! I don’t wanna watch this! What the hell???

ME: You asked me to tell you what happens to people who disappear. This is what. We’re playing a game and I don’t know the rules. Tim—your Discord is somehow part of the playbook. I’m gonna need access if I’m gonna survive this thing

TIM: uhh… access?

TIM: u mean my login info?

TIM: dude idk… like I don’t even really know u

ME: Come on man, these people DIED because you friended them. Whether you intended that to happen or not, these deaths come down to you. And so will mine when I’m next. The knocking won’t quit, I NEED to solve this

TIM: but y do u need more than screenshots

TIM: sry bro I’ll send more screenshots if u want but not my login

This fucking guy! *Screenshot this,* I type, with a pic of my middle finger. But I don’t send it because if I do I might as well marinate myself, lie down on a platter and ring the dinnerbell ‘cause I will definitely be cooked. I look again at the video. How there’s *nothing* there. If there is a way to beat this thing, it’s in Tim’s account, and I’ll need his cooperation.

So I unclench my jaw, sit back in my chair, and smile. Here’s a little confession—my reformation from a conman to a paranormal investigator isn’t so much a revolutionary change as it is the same old tune with some new lyrics. Yeah, it’s been a couple years since I cleaned up my act—but even reformed, I’m still a coyote wagging his tail to convince the world that he’s a friendly dog. And whether I’m swindling some poor sap out of his savings or just winning over my girl’s skeptical family, it’s the same performance. Because you see, it’s not actually that difficult to get people to trust you.

I do what I call the triple A’s: Ask. Agree. Affirm. First I *ask* about you, something simple and easy. Whatever you say, I *agree* with you. And then I *affirm* your feelings. Rinse and repeat.

Babe I got you, ima validate ALL your feelings. Just like when I’m catfishing, I’ll glean little bits of information from the things you tell me, build my profile of you from that so I know what you wanna hear. I’ll make you feel so *seen*.

I delete my middle-finger message to Tim and say:

ME: hey man I get it. ur just being cautious.

ME: If u can help me with screenshots, ur a lifesaver.

The screenshots he sends me are worthless, but I use them to learn more about him. In one of them he confides: *I swear my attempts at conversation repel people. i wish i could meet someone online who cares about actually talking to u.*

Hey man, *I* care. Right now, Timmy boy, I care about you more than anyone in the world. *Yeah, it’s almost impossible to make a real connection,* I agree. *It’s demoralizing, man, I feel u*, I affirm. Then I ask—*so serious question, when u friend people online, what r u actually looking for?* Like a salesman with a foot in the door, but what I’m selling is that sense of belonging, hoping he’ll open that door a little wider until I can step inside and convince him to hand over his password, his keys—whatever I need.

OK. You and me, Tim, let’s get this brodeo started.

\*\*\*

In about an hour, Tim and I are having the bromance of the century. No, I didn’t get his Discord login info—I did one better, and got his home address so we can go from Discord buds to beer buds while figuring this thing out (and while I sneak onto his computer and snoop). I tell him I’ll be there in twenty-five minutes and I call a Lyft.

And now, as I pace outside in the chill winter air waiting for my ride, with Boo peeking out the window after me anxiously, now comes the really hard part—letting my girl know where I’m going without *really* letting her know where I’m going, ‘cause I don’t want her at risk. But I also don’t want to go missing. She made me promise, once, never to do that to her—never to disappear without telling her where I’ll be.

I need her to know enough to find my corpse if I die.

\*\*\*

“Oh my God, *Jack I’m gonna kill you*!!!!” Emma screeches at me through the phone.

“What? Why?” I haven’t even said anything yet.

“You changed my ipad lockscreen to a picture of you naked with a flower in your mouth!”

I *did* do that. I thought it would be funny and also Emma’s iPad lives in her room, and usually doesn’t go out. But behind her patrons are seated around a café, the shop bell dinging as people flow in and out, her face close to the screen so she can whisper, and I’m distracted by the way her hair cascades over her bare shoulders. She’s stunning as always, like a kpop star ready to shoot an album cover. Sometimes I look at this girl and wonder how I ever batted so far outta my league. Emma’s smart and successful and has more academic accolades than I can count. Me? I’m a scruffy short dude (5’6 if I’m honest, 5’9 if you’re dyslexic… like I am when writing my dating profile). No job, not even a GED, just a checkered past and a nose for trouble. The only award I’m in the running for (and pretty sure I got this thing locked down now) is a Darwin award.

Emma checks over her shoulder to make sure no one’s listening, her cheeks flushed a pretty pink as she whispers, “I had a meeting with Yaira and left the ipad on the table while I went to use the bathroom and the whole fucking Starbucks saw your bare ass!!”

I burst out laughing. “OK, did you give out my number and tell them I charge by the minute?”

“Seriously? I’m gonna punch you!”

“Kinky. You promise?”

I imagine her balling her hands into tiny, cute fists as she exclaims, “Stop flirting while I’m scolding you! You know I take kickboxing. I WILL hurt you.”

“Mmm, yes please, Babe, come home and *punish* me—”

There’s the hangup tone.

A moment later, a text message: *I’M FILING FOR DIVORCE*

This is our love language. I look at the text and smile, but then my heart sinks because I know now that I am not going to tell my girl the truth about any of what is going on. Because if she knows, she will want to save me. And saving me would put her at risk. And the one thing that matters most in the world to me is not putting Emma at risk. I *know* it’s stupid. She’s dependable and resourceful and—honestly, she’s fucking brilliant. I could really, really use her help.

But I picture Lucia’s face—crammed in the darkness, claw hand covering her wide mouth in a stifled scream—and in my mind it morphs into Emma’s and no, no. Of all the bad decisions I’ve made so far today (and I’ve made *plenty*), this is the one stupid decision I actually feel good about. Because knowing she’s safe, my heart beats just a little easier.

Time now for me to go and pay a house call to my new best bud, Tim.

\*\*\*

When I near the little cul-de-sac matching his address, I start to feel it. It could be anticipation, could be just ordinary fear or uncertainty over what I’ll find. But I’ve got that sour taste in my throat, too, that metallic tang, and the slight chill on my skin, and by the time my Lyft drops me off at the edge of his driveway I’m sweating and the pit of dread in my stomach has hollowed out and there aren’t even any doors around but I hear the knocking in my skull now. A persistent hammering, a *thud thud thud* just under the beating of my own heart. And when I approach the front door, it gets louder. Until the KNOCKing is almost deafening.

The windows are dark and the blinds closed. There’s trash piled up in the yard. It hasn’t been brought to the curb, just left to fester. I type into Discord:

ME: I’m here, I think. That’s me ringing the bell.

TIM: Excuse me not getting up to come greet u. My back’s been killing me. But I’m here in back.

ME: Any chance you got an open window?

TIM: Try the kitchen? I usually leave that one cracked since it gets real hot in there. Might be a tight squeeze though.

The kitchen window is indeed tight—it’s one of the few times I’m glad for my weaselly size. The hardest part is getting my shoulders through, and when finally I’m able to squeeze in I find myself crouched on a filthy counter stacked with dishes. There’s old pizza boxes, cartons of half-eaten noodles covered in gray fuzz, dirty mugs developing their own ecosystem, and a half-empty bottle of Mr. Clean, his face so covered in crud only his eyes peek out, desperately begging for release. Perched on the tip of the bottle is a cockroach big enough to serve up on a platter.

TIM: sorry bout the mess

I tell him compared to my last apartment this place is the Ritz. It’s not (no matter what Emma claims about my bachelor days). Mainly due to the stink. An overpowering reek of mold, rotten food, BO, and whatever garbage juice is seeping from the pile of trash bags. Who knows. It’s rank. I could cocoon myself in my unwashed sheets for weeks, wake up and shove my face deep into my armpit and sniff, and it’d still smell fresher than in here. And beneath all the ripening odors is maybe another smell but I can’t be sure. I can’t be sure through all this stink.

TIM: Grab a beer if u want from the fridge

I’m about as tempted to grab a beer from his fridge as I am to pluck that massive roach off the counter and pop it in my mouth. But I snatch a couple of beers. And as I make my way through the house—living room, bedroom, bathroom—cautiously poking my head in each open room, the atmosphere is *dead* silent. Finally there is only one room left, down a narrow hallway toward a door at the end, slightly ajar. Still no sounds. No tapping keys. No voice calling through the door. Not even a “Hello.” Something is horribly off about all this. I should hear breathing, creaking, the squeak of a chair or a voice—*something.*

“Hey man, I got the beer!” I call.

Silence.

“Tim?”

There is no answer except for the *ping* on my phone.

TIM: come on in

Every instinct screams at me to *not* come on in. I lean closer to peek through the cracked door, only to gag and stumble back.

The stink—that stink! Oh God.

The smell is *so much worse* inside that room. Like a slaughtered pig carcass left to rot. And as I lean against the wall, choking on that horrific stench, Tim is still typing, asking me what sort of beer I like—seriously, what the *fuck* is going on here, man?

*Run, Jack, RUN!*

I know it would be a mistake to go inside. Probably the worst mistake, in a day full of bad mistakes, that I could make at this moment. And I know what Emma would say to me: “*Everyone makes mistakes, but Jack for the love of God you do not have to make a career out of it*.” But I think of 15-year-old Dwayne. I think of Lucia, and Boo the cat howling for her. I don’t believe in vengeance. But someone’s gotta stand up for them. Someone’s gotta make sure no one else is next. And even if going in there is risky—Emma knows as well as I do, if stupid were a career, my resume would be a mile long.

Guess today I’m really gunning for that Darwin award because I slip through the ajar door.

Pitch. Dark. I slip my shirt over my nose, my skin crawling as if covered in a million centipedes, my sensitivity to the supernatural triggered *so hard*, every hair stuck on end, every nerve vibrating like a plucked chord. Oh, this is bad. This is so, so bad. At the corner of the room glows a monitor. As my eyes adjust I make out the silhouette of a slouched figure, hands resting on the keyboard. The hands are not moving. Even in the bluish glare of the screen, the flesh looks bloated, patchy and dark.

My shirt muffles my voice. “Tim? Hey bud, you good?”

Tim is *not* good. I fumble along the walls for a light switch. Finally flick on the overhead lights.

In the sudden illumination, so bright it sears my eyeballs, adrenaline ignites my veins like lightning and I slam backwards into the door, a door that bumps closed and begins pounding with a thunderous KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKing that hammers my bones and threatens to splinter the wood. A KNOCKing I can barely hear over my sledgehammering heart, all air sucked from my lungs because oh FUCK me—on every surface in that room are symbols. They cover the walls, the ceiling. They circle in a mad spiral, circling and circling around the slouching figure in that chair, a figure whose eyes have melted out, and in that rotting skin are carved arcane markings. And now I understand—these symbols are painted in the murdered man’s blood. That’s the reason his home stinks so bad. The beer bottles fall from my grip and clatter to the floor as I notice his right hand. Oh. My bad. My bro-lliance with Tim really was a mistake. Another one for the resume. Because his right arm—it has no symbols carved into it. Instead those bloated fingers rest on the keyboard curled around a bloody knife.

This is no murder and he is no victim.

Nope, he did this to himself.

And in true Jack fashion, I’ve just locked myself in with [him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
