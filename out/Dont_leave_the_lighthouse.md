our story starts in the early 80's i was a teen trying to get some extra money for the summer

i came across a free listing in the newspaper looking for people to be an assistant at a lighouse far offshore

i decided to dial the number and the phone started ringing

the person who picked up the phone seemed like a very kind old man and we discussed everything

some times passes and it is time to take a boat out to the old lighthouse

the old man showed me when to turn on the light and how to operate everything and left on the same boat

me being a teenager i got to exploring the lightouse, the living space was in the basement, it smelled like salt and moss not much was in the room only a small 1 person bed and a bedside table, the wall was made of cobble stone with a drawing of kilroy was here  on the wall, a chest filled with a raincoat and some rubber boots under the spiral staircase that went all the way up to the light

i turned on the oil lantern i brought with me and just listened to the waves crash for a hour or two while thinking, i dont know what i was thinking abaut, the sun slowly went down and i grabbed the oil lantern to go up the staircase so i can turn on the light, the old wooden staircase creeking bellow my feet

finally reaching the top i turned on the light and looked out the balcony 

it was a quiet night, no moon coult be seen and it was so dark i coulnt see the bottom of the tower only me and the waves. it was a relaxing feeling

as i was going down the staircase i saw light shine in the window behind me and i looked out. seeing a medium sized tugboat slowly sail dangerously close to the lighthouse this manouver whould have been impossible as the waves where really high and going in the direction of the lighthouse but the boat seemed unbotheres. i shouted for anybody on the boat to warn them of the dangerous rocks they whould crash into any moment,

my shouting fell on deaf ears. no response. only the boats lights flickering onboard

now horrified for me and the boats safety i ran down the staircase as fast as i coult only to open the lighouses front door to see what seemed to be the tugboat captain standing on his boat looking directly at me

the boat was so close if i jumped i could have landed on it, he gave me a slight grin and said nothing else, me who liked to read horror comics at the time closed the door as fast as i could. back in the room now i tried to sleep because that was all i could do in the nearmy empty room, looking at the bedside table i saw a note written by the old man i was too lazy to read before. it read 𝖽𝗈𝗇𝗍 𝗅𝖾𝖺𝗏𝖾 𝗍𝗁𝖾 𝗅𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍𝗁𝗈𝗎𝗌𝖾
