CW: addiction, mention of physical & sexual child abuse

\*\*\*\*\*

I used to be one of those kids who could get lost in a daydream.  

When my mother left me alone with no food but two-month-old wheat thins and the power went out, I’d pretend I was an intrepid explorer, seeking out treasure in the darkest, coldest, most bug-infested cave.  When I’d run from the apartment to escape my stepfather’s drunken rages and take refuge in an unlocked bathroom at the local park, I could convince myself I was the main character - a hero plotting my revenge, not a scared kid trembling on a filthy tile floor.  While I was pushing cut-rate tar dope in the North Valley, I imagined I sold magic in a fantasy regime where magic was forbidden.  And on loud nights in the State Penitentiary, I’d close my eyes and pretend to be a spy undercover, deep in enemy territory, rescuing prisoners of war.  

But life isn’t a fairy tale.  And nothing relives you of that delusion quicker than being dumped in a halfway house in an expensive city with a felony conviction, no job prospects, and a kid to support.  

Then, my old prison chaplain gave me a call.  He said he knew of a 401c3 looking for an ex-con with construction experience to manage the remodeling of a property in Glendale.  Specifically, an ex-con who’s also a young parent.  

“Construction experience” was pushing it a little bit.  I’d taken day laborer gigs during a brief stint of sobriety, but all I’d done was dig holes and carry stuff.  I did have the second requirement down pat: I was a young parent.  I had a four-year-old son, Theo.  He lived in a group home.  And if I wanted custody, I needed a steady paycheck.  

Life isn’t a fairy tale.  But that job lead might as well have been my personal Letter from Hogwarts.

\*\*\*\*\*

“We’re a little tight,” Miss Janice said.  “So we can only pay eighteen bucks an hour, plus expenses, of course.”

*Only eighteen bucks an hour.*  I stopped myself from smirking at Miss Janice’s sweet smile.  If I were the sort of guy who got off on cheating naive middle-aged women, I’d sit on my ass all day, draw out the job as long as possible, and milk that hourly wage until she grew some street-smarts.  

“That’s fine,” I said.  “So long as that eighteen an hour comes with a paper trail.” 

That morning, I’d borrowed forty bucks from my sober living buddy, filled up the tank of my 1993 Toyota Camry, and arrived at the Glendale property at eight am sharp.  It was way up in the hills, a large lot with two structures: a red-brick church with a sloping roof and a cupola with a cross, run down and storm-weathered; and a small, squat, blue building with a fenced-in playground.

I’d met three representatives.  There was Miss Janice: a short, round white woman with a pert bob, glasses, and an outfit out of a stock photo labeled 80’s Yuppie.  Then, Miss Annie: a tall, slender black woman with box braids and hippie style.  And Miss Marin: racially-ambiguous, voluptuous, and wearing a frilly, multicolored dress that made me think of a piñata.  They were all roughly between forty and fifty years old, and all spoke in the same cheerful-but-subdued tone of voice.  

The nonprofit they worked for was called All Souls Wide Open; when I asked what the nonprofit actually did, their answers were evasive.  They did show me around the church, which they intended for me to remodel into a dorm-style shelter.  

The interior of the church had been destroyed in a fire, thirty years before, and little - if anything - had been done to the property since then.  The walls were scalded, revealing melting insulation.  Pieces of ceiling had caved in.  The floor was littered with glass and broken boards and detritus and what looked like more than one dead animal.  

I wasn’t qualified for the job.  I wasn’t anything resembling qualified for the job.

But, it turns out I *was* the sort of guy who gets off on cheating naive, middle-aged women.  Or, at least, I was willing to string naive middle-aged women along for a few months - until I got an apartment, Theo, and a small cushion of savings.  

So I told The Misses I could definitely remodel their church; I knew exactly what I was doing.

I asked if I should call them something else.  An adult referring to another adult as Miss Janice or whatever felt weird.  But they said it’s how they were used to being addressed.  

“Actually,” Miss Annie said, “there is something else we’d like to discuss with you.  You have a child, correct?”

I nodded.  “A son.  He’s four, gonna be five in August.”

“And you’re a single parent?” Miss Marin asked.

I nodded again.  “My wife passed some years ago.”

“Then we suppose you’ll be in need of childcare.”

I, embarrassingly, hadn’t considered that.  I’d been so focused on convincing the State of California I was fit to be a parent, I hadn’t had time to think about what I’d do with Theo once I had custody.  It was March, and he wouldn’t start kindergarten until the fall.

“Uh… yeah,” I stammered to The Misses.

Miss Marin beamed.  “Perfect.  You see, we’re de facto property managers here - but primarily, we’re teachers.  We run All Souls Preschool next door.  And we’d like to offer your child a place in our program.  Since we can’t pay you much, consider his education to be part of your salary.”

I barely concealed a goofy grin as I shook the hands of my three fairy godmothers.  

\*\*\*\*\*

After I signed the tax forms and promised The Misses I’d be back first thing Monday morning, I drove to the park for a supervised visit with Theo and his social worker, Alyssa.

Theo didn’t call me Mister anymore, but he wouldn’t call me Dad, either.  He didn’t refer to me as anything at all.  But he did give me a shy hug when I knelt down in front of him, and he allowed me to sit next to him in the sandbox and dig holes.  I asked him how he liked his group home.  He said the boy who slept in the bunkbed above him screamed all night, but he was allowed to have Oreo cookies if he finished his dinner.  I told him a couple kid-friendly jokes I knew; he didn’t laugh.  Then he found a stick and went to dig holes under the slide, his way of saying “I’m done socializing and wish to be alone.”

I sat at a picnic table with Alyssa and watched Theo dig.  Alyssa was about my age and, if she wasn’t the gatekeeper between me and my son, I wouldn’t have looked at her twice.  She had chestnut-brown hair and a round face, average weight, average height, and  always dressed in jeans and a sweater with a messy bun.  As far as low-ranking civil servants went, I’d drawn the longest straw possible with Alyssa.  Theo worshipped Alyssa; she adored him.  She never judged me for my past, patiently answered my questions, always answered the phone, and treated my small steps towards custody as Olympics-level triumphs.  

When I told her about my new job, though, she was uncharacteristically skeptical.

“Eighteen dollars an hour?” she asked. 

“Plus Theo can go to their daycare,” I insisted.  “I saw it.  The daycare’s really nice.”

Alyssa chewed the inside of her cheek.  “It’s not the amount of money that worries me.  It’s… my dad’s a contractor.  Compensation for construction projects usually isn’t set up like that.”

I tapped the lighter I kept in my pocket six times.  *Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.*  

I needed to quit smoking - I’d definitely quit smoking before Theo came to live with me.  But the weight of the lighter in my pocket was comforting, like the teddy bear I’d never had.  Since I’d been sprung from the state penitentiary, I’d taken to tapping it when I was nervous or frustrated, always in multiples of six.  

Six was a good number.  When I was six, I’d been voted Best Artist by my first grade class, and I’d chased that high ever since.

“It’s legit, I promise,” I said to Alyssa.  “I signed a W-12 or whatever.”

“A W-9,” Alyssa corrected.  “Well, so long as you’re holding down a job and creating a stable living situation, I’m sure my supervisor will sign off on Theo’s custody as early as May.”

I smiled.  That’s all I needed to hear.

Theo had grown bored of his hole and wandered over to a grassy field, where something sticking out of the ground captured his attention.  Alyssa and I followed him.  His new preoccupation was a white mushroom - there were a few tufts of them, forming a circle in the grass.

“Don’t touch that, buddy,” I said to Theo.  “It might be poisonous.”

He turned to me, dark eyes wide and fearful, immediately withdrew his little finger, and shuffled backwards until he fell on his butt.  

*Bang-up parenting, Jake*, I told myself.  *Now he’s gonna be scared of mushrooms.*

Alyssa knelt down to his level.  “Hey Theo, I read this old book about mushroom circles.  Do you want to know what it said?”

Theo stared at her, rapt.

“According to the book, if you can lure an elemental into a mushroom circle, it’ll be trapped!  Like a genie.  And if you trap an elemental, it has to be your servant until you set it free.  It’ll do your homework for you!  It can chase off other, scary supernatural creatures from your nightmares!  Do you know how to lure an elemental?”

Theo, eyes wide, shook his head.

“You make up a rhyme!”  Alyssa exclaimed with a smile on her face.  “Elementals love rhymes!”

Theo nodded enthusiastically.  He hopped up and looked at the mushroom circle with an expression of reverence.  Then, he scampered off to think up an appropriate rhyme.

“I wouldn’t have pegged you for a fantasy novel type,” I said to Alyssa.  

She made a face.  “Yeah, that book was weird.  It’s been out of print for ages.  There’s two of them in the series, and the second got kinda dark.  Like, *human sacrifice because elementals require blood to retain their human forms* dark.  I just read it because…”

She shook her head.  I didn’t ask questions.  I was about to become an actual parent; I supposed I should get used to children’s book plots that mild-to-moderately resembled an acid trip.  Composing an elemental-trapping rhyme kept Theo busy until the sun set and Alyssa had to return him to the group home.  

Theo didn’t hug me on the way out.  But, before he climbed into Alyssa’s car, he turned and waved.  

I smoked two cigarettes on the drive back to sober living, the burn of the chemicals soothing on the back of my throat.  I wasn’t sure if I was smoking to dull the preemptive stress of a new job and parenthood, or to celebrate my new job and increased likelihood of Theo’s custody, or because I’d been chasing dope since I was sixteen and needed a new addiction to keep me off the old.  I’d picked up nicotine in prison.  I could barely justify the cost of the occasional pack. 

I’d quit tomorrow, I promised myself.  

I stopped counting how many times I’d broken that promise.  That was my greatest talent, truly.  Breaking promises.  

\*\*\*\*\*

Three months later, Alyssa’s superior signed the paperwork and restored my full parental rights.

During those three months, I’d been on my best behavior.  I limited myself to three cigarettes per day.  (Okay fine, five cigarettes per day.  Six on weekends.)  I found a place for Theo and me to live: a cute little guest house in East Hollywood, with a backyard and two outdoor cats.  My landlord was an octogenarian lady whose family lived out of state.  She rented me the place for so cheap, so far below market value, I felt like I’d gotten away with highway robbery.  I’m not sure whether she felt sorry for me or she simply didn’t know how much her property was worth - either way, I agreed to the obscenely low rent with a demure smile.  

I threw myself into fixing up the church.  I arrived at eight every morning and left at five.  I spent my days collecting garbage, loading garbage into bins, and arranging for that garbage to be hauled away.  On my lunch breaks and, sometimes, after I finished for the day, I sat on an old bench in the parking lot and watched the children play. 

All Souls Preschool was tiny, I only counted six students.  As I watched them ride tricycles around, stack blocks, and run about playing an indecipherable game of pretend, I learned their names and personalities.  There was Grace, a scrawny but confident blonde girl with thin, waist-length hair.  Anna Rae, Grace’s pudgy sidekick, a shy Latina who still sucked her thumb.  Corbin, a carrot top who resembled a real-life Chuckie from Rugrats.  Jason, dark-skinned and thoughtful.  Peter, Asian and a size smaller than the rest, with excited chihuahua energy.  And Winter, a ball-shaped chatterbox who only ever stopped talking to sing, off-key and loudly.  

They were all cute enough.  But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t notice anything strange about the kids - or their caretakers, The Misses.

For starters, the All Souls Preschool playground was surrounded by a number of trees with pretty red flowers.  Poinsettias, I learned.  More than once, as I walked to my car after a day of work, I’d seen one of The Misses slashing at the trunk of one of the poinsettia trees with a pocket knife.  Just, going at it like it owed her money.  The trunks of all the trees were etched with cuts in various stages of scarring over.  

Another time, the kids - all six of them - joined hands in a circle and skipped around and around, reciting a little poem.  It went something like:  

*One was sweet, but she never got a stitch.*

*Two played cute with her hair all fixed.*

*Three was a belle, but she had no ball.*

*Four had pride, and then she had a fall.*

The optics were a little culty, but the chant itself wasn’t offensive or concerning in any way.  Kids like nonsensical rhymes.  So I couldn’t figure out why Miss Annie felt it necessary to come flying out of the school building, screeching at the top of her lungs.

“STOP THAT SONG!  STOP IT NOW!  IF I EVER CATCH YOU…”

She didn’t need to finish her threat.  The kids let go of each others’ hands and scattered to the far edges of the playground.  Miss Annie’s head snapped in my direction.  She caught my eye then, perhaps guiltily, looked down.

“Back inside, kids,” she announced, firm but calmer.  “Recess is over.”

The strangest incident, though, happened on a Friday in May.  The day before Theo would be moving into our new home.  

The day started off great.  I had nearly all of the debris cleaned out of the church.  After lunch, I intended to finish up the last room - a little Sunday school classroom at the back, which had been an extra pain in the ass because desks and cubbies were left behind.  

In the early afternoon, as I was ass-deep in a closet, pulling out waterlogged wooden boards, I heard children’s voices.  

*One was sweet, but she never got a stitch.*

*Two played cute with her hair all fixed.*

I straightened up so fast I nearly hit my head. 

*Three was a belle, but she had no ball.*

*Four had pride, and then she had a fall.*

I made my way down a hallway to the nave of the church, the sing-song kiddie verses growing louder with each step I took.

*Five twirled her hair like a downtown tease*

*Six tossed her skirts in the January breeze.*

“Okay guys, you’ve had your fun,” I said, my hand on the nave door.  “Now it’s time to…”

I pushed the door forcefully.  The nave was empty.  The chant stopped.

Then, a child’s high-pitched giggle broke the silence, coming from one of the administrative offices to the left of the nave.  I rerouted and started down that hallway.  

“This is actually very dangerous, kids,” I shouted.  “Do you want to get smooshed by a falling ceiling tile?”

I spoke mostly to reassure myself.  The church’s electricity had been disconnected years before, but the lack of power hadn’t been an issue because the weather had been sunny and the building was Swiss cheesed by windows and skylights that allowed for plenty of natural light.  But that day was uncharacteristically cloudy, and the west hallway was uncharacteristically dark.

I saw movement from a narrow, particularly dark office.  I strode towards it, and was confronted by an odd silhouette: a small boy, his back to me, traced a finger over a patch of wall less destroyed than the rest.  I squinted, and realized the boy was Corbin, the little Chuckie Finster doppelgänger.  

“Hey buddy, what’cha doing?” I said enticingly, trying to control the tremor in my voice.  “You know you’re not supposed to be here, right?”

The kid didn’t move.  I took a deep breath, found my balls, and approached him.  I grabbed his shoulders and turned him around.

“Kiddo, you need to start listening to…”

I saw the kid’s face, and my pretensions of being an authoritative adult melted away like mist.  

Corbin’s head was cocked slightly, like a cartoon of a hanged corpse.  His eyes - wide, fixed, unblinking, and unknowing - resembled a doll’s.  His lower jaw dipped and bounced rhythmically, as though he were a marionette on a string, controlled by a demented elder god.  Noise emanated from his lifeless mouth.  He was whispering something.

“You’ve… you’ve gotta speak up, buddy,” I croaked out.

His voice increased in volume.  “Kakakak…lalab…ananupupup….nenonu…bobobobobo…”

He uttered disjointed syllables, in a tone too low for a kid whose balls hadn’t dropped yet… I couldn’t take it anymore.  I shook Corbin.

“Fucking STOP IT!” I yelled.

That seemed to reboot the boy’s brain.  He blinked, straightened his head, and narrowed his eyes at me in a combination of surprise and anger.

“What’s going on with you, kid?”

I barely had time to get the words out before bargain-bin Chuckie broke away from me and ran.  In an instant, he was out of my sight.  I was too thoroughly weirded out by his Lovecraftian whispering and dead eyes to notice he moved way too fast for a child at his stage of development.  He moved like a lizard or a beetle, a crawling thing that darts in and out of the light. 

Then, I heard singing.  

*They all want to dance, but if you want to go to heaven*

*You’ll reach out your hand and you’ll dance with seven.*  

The song echoed from behind me.  I steeled myself, stomped down the hallway, and re-entered the Sunday school classroom I’d been cleaning out earlier.  There, I was confronted by the sight a tiny dark-skinned girl, clutching a splintering piece of wood in her hands.  

Winter.  The loud one.  

“Seven!”  She intoned.  “SEVEN!  SEVEN!  SEVEN!”

Her face, unlike Corbin’s, was expressive and emotive.  But like Corbin, she seemed to be caught in a trance.  She turned the splintering wood over and over, cutting her fingers, allowing blood to run down her arms.

“SEVEN!  SEVEN!”

I lunged, grabbed her by the arm, and pulled the bloody wood away from her.  She reached for me with both hands and caught ahold of my face, smearing blood across my cheeks.  I let go.  I stumbled back.  The preschooler stared up at me with an intensity too dark, too old…

“WINTER!  You get over here right now.”

I whirled around to see Miss Marin standing in the doorway, arms crossed.  Behind her, Miss Janice clutched a pouting Corbin by an arm.  Miss Marin strode past me to pick up Winter, who didn’t protest.

“I’m so sorry, Jake,” she said kindly.  “One of us must’ve accidentally left the gate open.  Please, take the rest of the day off.  We’ll pay you, of course.”

I forced myself to nod.  The Misses left with the kids, who’d reverted back to normal small children, whining in their lisping voices and wiping their noses on their sleeves.  I scrubbed Winter’s blood off my cheeks in the bathroom.  I could definitely use a half-day - I wanted to finish painting Theo’s room green, his favorite color.  

Before I left, though, I returned to the office where I’d found Corbin in a trance.  Carved into the wall, right where he’d stood, I found the strange symbol he’d run his finger over.  It looked like four hearts, overlapping, in a cross shape.  Or a four-leaf clover.  

\*\*\*\*\*

That night, I dreamed I was playing in a grassy field, whirling around and around with all my brothers and sisters.  I felt careless and free - the sort of freedom that only exists in children experiencing a happy childhood, who know their needs will be taken care of and a warm pair of arms waits to catch then in a loving embrace, just outside of their field of vision, so their only responsibility to the world is to experience joy.  

I’d never felt it, but I recognized it.

I whirled and whirled.  I took my siblings’ hands, and we danced in a circle, around and around, faster and faster…

Then a cold reality crashed down.

I was alone.  I was unprotected.  I was cut off from that warmth.  

A shadowy pair of arms reached for me…

And then I woke up.

My back ached.  As the dream ebbed, I realized why.  I’d somehow managed to fall asleep, sitting up, against my kitchen cabinets.  With green paint - the paint I’d rolled onto Theo’s walls the previous afternoon - all over my hands.

I stood up, stretching out my sore muscles.  I blinked.

There were words scrawled all over the house - on windows, walls, appliances, and even the ceiling - in that deep green paint.  The same words.  Over and over.

*Save the children.*

In my handwriting.
