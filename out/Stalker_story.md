I swear man Japan is a fucking weird place.

  
I'm an 22 year old guy that is currently working in Germany however before I've study abroad in Japan. I have long been fascinated with the culture, the people, the food, mainly everything about the country. It's perhaps one of my favorites if I'm being honest. However, my perspective on Japan might've just changed after a certain incident.

  
It was a few years ago, I couldn't remember the exact date. I was walking back from college when I spotted a really cute Japanese girl, she seemed to be in the same college as mine although she looked slightly younger since I was a second-year there. I'm a pretty flirty guy, sort of. So I did what I usually do, which was to approach her and ask if she wanted to talk. The girl did in fact responded, her name was Aiko. However, she was acting really weird, her tone was really awkward and her responses sounds like it belongs more to a basic Japanese learner more than anything else. A shop owner, nearby, was warning me to stay away from her. She claims that the girl was here everyday and speak something odd and creepy. Apparently, the girl was suffering from a mental disorder which made her go insane for most of the time if not with the help of assistance. I was pretty stunned and terrified since I did read a lot of horror stories that mainly involves with the other party having some sort of problems with their brain and stuff like that so I just apologized to her and just f\*ck out of there. The girl on the other hand was calm but I can swear I heard a light chuckle from behind my back with the words which I assume to be about a specific time: 8:30 \~ 9 PM.

  
Now of course, I'm a lazy guy so I went to a convenient store, get some drinks, get some food and head home for the day. Well... I spent my time like I usually do, eat, watch some films. HOWEVER, at exactly 8:36 PM, somebody pressed the doorbell, I didn't ordered anything so it was quite strange, I did take a little peak outside and was literally breathless for a few minutes.

  
A FUCKING BLACK FIGURE (I mean the clothes not skin) WITH A MASK ON (it was like a circus mask but was painted a little red)

  
Dude, I'm the type of person to get easily scared during a horror movie so of course it scared me the fuck out and of course I ain't opening that door. Although I did notice that the figure was a bit small and petite, feminine-like.

  
I literally nearly fainted and was curling inside my blanket for a while panting, the ringing sounds did continue for another few minutes before stopping.

  
At around 9:16, I peak outside again and the FIGURE WAS STILL FUCKING THERE. However, I wasn't as nervous as before since I realized something was off, the figure made zero movements, ZERO. So, I literally open the door as fast as I could and kick down the thing before closing it again. Apparently it was a fucking stand with a black cloak and the mask.

  
I was relief now so I opened the door and noticed a tiny box. Inside was a Kokeshi doll, which symbolizes friendship or love. I was too chicken to take it so I didn't do much with it. However, a note was found besides it, the handwriting was pretty neat and clean, now I'm not so good at Japanese by any means but I think it means "15 left". Of course, I don't understand what it means so I ignore it and threw it away. (Yeah, big mistake) Also, the letters were written in a red paint, which I really hope it is just colors.

  
Anyways, I was pretty haunted with the whole situation pretty much, I kept thinking about that note and didn't know what to make of it. However, that same day, on my desk, as expected, another note, this time, the handwriting was more messed up, as if it wasn't the same person writing the note. It said "14 left".

  
Okay, I was really freaked out by now and I did ask some friends of mine for help in which well, they didn't believe me and call me a "baka". 

  
Now, it took me around 3 days, the notes kept flying in, I was really scared for my life right now, what was going on... no one trusted me. I planned to contact the police but was also not sure if this was necessary. After all, I wasn't hurt or anything. But then, at the back of one specific note at the top corner, there was this syllable: け (ke)

Now it indeed is a syllable in the Hiragana syllabary but what the hell does that mean?

I legit spent nearly 2 hours and finally I crack the code (maybe)

The syllable was found at the back of the 3rd note sent by this unknown individual I'm dealing with. If we use a shift of 3 on the Hiragana syllabary from left to right, we get the syllable: き(ki)

  
I was stuck there, no idea what the hell does that even mean?

  
Supposedly, there is one pretty logical theory I could think of, the tree. At the time I got this theory, I just received the 9th note, meaning, "7 left". 

  
Now, besides my apartment room, there is a pretty big tree, but at the time it was autumn so you know... leaves fall and I could see clearly 6 LEAVES remaining on the branches. Does this mean the numbers here represent the leaves? I was puzzled but then I realized there were only 6, why does the note say 7?

  
Okay, on a side note, while all of this is happening, I NEVER saw the girl going back to the place again for some odd reason. I also had a feeling of being stalked, constant noises were made when I walked in secluded alleyways, areas. Even sometimes giggling, which btw freaked me out. I even saw a strange shadow in the streets below one time, nearly made me faint.

  
So... time passes, until, I notice, there weren't any leaves left. But then... the last note came.

  
1 left.

  
Nothing happened, at least, at that moment. But then, at exactly 1:22 AM, I heard a knock on the door, of course no way I'm opening that, but it was all... fake.

I turned around and...

  
I saw the girl, her face was legitimately ON THE WINDOW. HER FACE WAS LIKE THAT OF A PSYCHOPATH, SHE HAD A GRIN ON HER FACE! 

  
I felt as if my blood had just freeze at that point, I think she had a knife too. Now, I did lock the window but somehow she managed to crack it and threw the knife at me, it didn't hit me but it did scratch me. I couldn't see very well due to the darkness. The girl kept laughing while trying to get in, I felt as if I was gonna die there.

  
Now, at this point, you guys may ask, how the hell did you survive? Well uh... I ran out the fucking door and just escaped out of there, ran to my friend's house and call the police.

  
The girl of course, escaped and I never saw any sights of her again. I left Japan a few years after graduating and moved away but it was a terrific experience.

  
Now, some of you may ask, how the hell did the girl was on the window? Well, my friends, because my apartment room is only at the 3rd floor. Very close to the ground.

  
There were some mysteries I couldn't solve: what's up with the syllable? What does the notes mean? Who knocked on the door before the event occur? 

  
I'm not sure and just hope to forget it but my dear friends, please be aware of who you interact with and be safe out there.
