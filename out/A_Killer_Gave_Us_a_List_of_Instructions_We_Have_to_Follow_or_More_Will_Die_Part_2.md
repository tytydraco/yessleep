As the sun begins to rise, casting an eerie glow through the dense fog, the crime scene becomes a flurry of activity. CSI teams in white suits swarm the area, their movements meticulous as they comb through the marsh, documenting and collecting every scrap of evidence with clinical precision.

Audry and I watch them from a distance, our hands stuffed into the pockets of our jackets as a shield against the morning chill. Their careful movements unearth more than just the sad remnants of hurried flight. With each brush and marker set down, the layers of the night's horrors peel back, revealing deeper, darker secrets etched into the earth and trees around us.

One of the forensic technicians, a young woman with sharp eyes and a steady hand, calls us over. "Hey, detectives, you need to see this!"

We make our way over, our boots sinking slightly into the softened earth. The technician points to a set of tracks leading away from the crime scene. They're unlike any shoe or animal print; these are deep, oddly shaped grooves that seem to twist unnaturally, almost as if the creature that made them was skimming rather than walking on the marshy surface.

"Could be some sort of dragging," Martínez suggests, but his tone lacks conviction. I crouch down for a closer look. The tracks are irregular, spaced erratically as if whatever made them was staggering or... not entirely of this world.

Each print has a sharp, almost claw-like feature at the ends, suggesting whatever made them was neither fully animal nor human. They lead towards the dense underbrush, then disappear as if the maker had suddenly taken flight or simply vanished.

"Have these been cast yet?" I ask, keeping my voice low.

The tech nods. "Yeah, we've got casts and photos. But there's something else."

She leads me to the tree where we found the girl. At first glance, it looks like any other part of this morbid tableau, but then she hands me a flashlight. "Shine it here," he instructs. The beam catches on something etched deeply into the bark. Carved symbols, crude yet deliberate, spiral up the trunk.

Each symbol, jagged and deep, depicts scenes that are disturbingly ritualistic in nature—human figures in various poses of submission and agony, their limbs splayed outwards as if in offering. The central figure in the tableau is a towering, skeletal figure, its skin peeled back to reveal muscle and bone.

"The flayed god," I whisper, recognition dawning as the details of the carvings become clearer.

"We're dealing with a cult," Audrey concludes, her voice steady despite the gruesome realization.

After the initial shock of the gruesome crime scene, Audrey and I retreat back to the command tent to pore over the video of Lucia Alvarez. The setup is makeshift, a couple of laptops and monitors propped on a folding table, the humming of generators outside barely drowning out the eerie silence of the marshland.

"Let's run through this again," Audrey says, clicking on the video file labeled "Último Mensaje." The grainy footage flickers to life, Lucia's haunted face filling the screen.

As the video plays, I focus on the background, looking for any detail that might tell us where it was taken. The room is dim, but there are shadows that suggest depth and the presence of objects just out of the camera's view. Audrey jots down notes as we watch, pausing the video at key moments to scrutinize the surroundings.

"There," I point out, pausing the video. In the corner of the room, barely visible, is a poster with distinctive markings—perhaps a local band or a political advertisement. "That poster might help us pinpoint the location."

Audrey nods, zooming in on the image. We examine the poster, the resolution grainy but just clear enough to make out the first of a word and the first letter of the second. "NEW H—" the visible text reads, followed by a partially obscured logo that could be a sun or a gear, the edges blurred and indistinct.

"We need to enhance this, see if we can pull out more details," Audrey suggests, already on her phone, contacting the tech team for image enhancement.

My mind is racing. I recognize that logo from somewhere, something I came across in a report or a briefing note, perhaps. "Let's dig into it later, see if we can pull up anything on local businesses or landmarks with that name."

As the low hum of the generator filled the air, Audrey leaned back in her chair, a frown creasing her brow. "This Lord of the Underworld... who do you think that refers to? It’s all a bit dramatic, like something out of a horror film."

I rubbed my chin, pondering. "Sounds like something Aztec or Mayan, maybe?” My knowledge isn’t exactly comprehensive. Just bits and pieces of stories my mom used to tell me. Gods and spirits, all interwoven with lessons and warnings. None of that stuff particularly interested me.

Pulling out my phone, I type in "Lord of the Underworld" along with some keywords from our current case—ritual, cult, Aztec. The search churns through data, and within seconds, links to various articles and mythological databases pop up. One entry catches my eye, a piece on Mictlantecuhtli, the Aztec god of death and the underworld. I go to images and see the god depicted as a skeletal figure, surrounded by motifs of decay and regeneration.

I show the phone to Audrey, who leans over for a better look. "That’s our perp, huh? “Mictlantecuhtli," I muse, struggling to pronounce the Nahuatl word.

I scroll through more entries, but none provide a clear motive or reasoning behind such gruesome displays. It's like trying to read a book where half the pages are ripped out.

"What do you think he meant by 'for those who have seen death closely but survived'? That's not just random, it's targeted."

I lean back against the flimsy chair, the metal creaking under my weight. "I've got a bad feeling about this, Aud," I confess, feeling the weight of each word. "It’s like... it’s like that message isn’t just for anyone. It’s for us."

Audrey's eyes narrow, her analytical mind piecing together the unsaid. "The Alvarez case?" she murmurs, the name hanging in the air like a cold breath. "We came out of that by the skin of our teeth.”

"Yeah." The memory sits heavy in my stomach. We'd walked through a nightmare landscape, bodies scattered, a community shattered.

We decide to shift attention towards the hunt for the chapel described in Lucia's chilling video begins. We pour over maps of Otay Mesa and the surrounding areas, scouring every database and record we can access for any mention of the San Pedro chapel. The name is common enough to make it a difficult search, but eventually, we narrow it down to a few possible locations. One in particular, an abandoned chapel on the outskirts of Otay Mesa, stands out. It’s isolated, rundown, and has a history of being a hotspot for illicit activities.

With the chapel identified, we return to uncovering the killer's potential hideout. The forensic evidence collected at the crime scene proves invaluable. The peculiar, claw-like tracks leading away from the scene are of particular interest.

Upon closer examination, the forensic team uncovers soil discrepancies in the samples taken near the tracks.

The analysis from the forensics team reveals traces of minerals not typically found in the marshy outskirts of Otay Mesa. Instead, these minerals match those found in the more arid, rocky terrains to the north.

Utilizing geological maps, we pinpoint several potential areas where this soil composition could have originated. It's a tedious process, cross-referencing environmental data with recent satellite imagery to narrow down the locations.

It hits me that "NEW H-" could be the start of a company's name, possibly a mining company given the odd minerals found at the crime scene.

I open up a browser on one of the laptops, typing in "mining company" along with "NEW H" and "San Diego" as additional search terms. The results are mostly news articles about the local industry, but nothing catches my eye. I refine the search, adding "defunct" or "closed" to the terms. After several attempts and refining keywords, a hit—an old article about a now-defunct mining company catches my attention: New Horizon Quarries.

"Look at this," I call over to Audrey, pointing at the screen. The article is from a local paper, dated back several years, discussing the closure of New Horizon Quarries due to a series of legal and environmental issues. It mentions the company's last known operating location—a quarry on the northern edge of San Diego County, not too far from our current location.

This can't be a coincidence. The unique mineral traces, the location, and now a potential link to a quarry—it all starts to form a disturbing picture. We decide it's worth a shot to check out this quarry.

As Audrey and I huddle in the dim light of the command tent, the weight of what we’ve discovered presses down on us. We’re at a crucial juncture, each decision a potential misstep in a dance with an unknown and deadly partner.

“Okay, let’s think this through,” I start, tapping a pen against the notepad filled with details from the night. “We can’t just follow these instructions blindly. It’s obviously a trap—or at least a diversion.”

Audrey nods, her face set in a determined grimace. “Right, but we’ve got to engage somehow, keep him thinking we’re playing his game while we work our angle. We need to track this guy down before anyone else ends up like Lucia.”

The strategy is clear: engage, but on our terms. I sketch out a rough plan on a scrap of paper.

We map out a risky two-pronged approach. Audrey and I, along with a few trusted members from Martinez's team, will head to the chapel as per the instructions in Lucia's video. We'll make a show of following the steps, careful to keep our actions visible enough to suggest compliance without actually fulfilling the ritual's darker requirements. Meanwhile, another team, equipped with the best tracking and surveillance gear we have, will scout out the quarry, hoping to catch the killer or whoever is orchestrating these events off guard.

As the plan solidifies, I pull out my cell, dialing the number of our superior, Captain Barrett. The line clicks, and his gruff voice, perpetually tinged with the rasp of too many years on the job, crackles through the speaker.

“Castillo, what’s the situation?” Barrett’s voice is all business, the underlying concern barely noticeable beneath the surface.

I lean against the cold metal of our makeshift command center, watching the early morning mist roll over the marshlands. “Captain, we’ve got a lead on the murder. We think the perpetrator might be holed up in an abandoned quarry to the north of here.” There’s a pause, heavy with the weight of every bad outcome that could unfold from this conversation. “You think or you know?” Barrett’s tone sharpens, slicing through the fog of uncertainties.

“We’re nearly certain, sir,” I saw, walking him through the evidence and our plan. Barrett exhales heavily over the line, a low sound that carries all the weight of his experience and the ghosts of cases gone wrong. "Alright, Castillo, but I'm holding you to it. We can't have another Alvarez mess on our hands. You get in, assess the situation, and get out. No heroics, understand?"

"Understood, sir," I assure him, feeling the gravity of his words. "We'll handle it by the book."

He grunts, a noncommittal sound that's as close to an agreement as I'm likely to get from him. "Keep me updated, every step of the way. And Castillo?"

"Yes, sir?"

"Be careful. This sounds like you're walking into a den of snakes with a stick. Make sure it's a big stick."

The line goes dead, leaving a small echo of static that fades into the stillness of the morning.

— We spend the early part of the afternoon gearing up, pouring over maps and checking our equipment twice. Audrey and I, along with a couple of seasoned officers from Martinez's team, load up our SUVs with everything we might need—night vision goggles, body armor, and more firepower than I'd like to think necessary.

As the morning sun lifts the dense fog just enough to lend an eerie glow to the surroundings, our convoy heads out. Audrey and I are in the lead SUV, the mood tense but focused. We're heading to the chapel, the supposed site of the next ritual according to Lucia's chilling message. Meanwhile, the second team is making their way to the quarry, moving in quietly with the hopes of catching our suspect off guard.

We maintain open lines of communication, each vehicle fitted with radios tuned to a secure channel. The static crackles occasionally, the voice of Sergeant Rodríguez from the Sheriff’s Department checking in, his tone clipped and business-like. "Team two approaching the quarry perimeter. All quiet so far."

"Copy that," I respond, keeping my eyes on the dusty road leading up to the chapel. The structure looms in the distance, an abandoned relic that looks like it hasn't seen a congregation in decades. Its isolated location makes it an ideal spot for nefarious deeds, far from prying eyes, yet here we are, about to pry.

As we near the chapel, the air thickens with an uneasy stillness, the kind that speaks more of abandonment than peace. The structure itself casts long, sinister shadows across the cracked earth, its steeple jagged against the sky like a broken finger pointing accusingly at us intruders.

Audrey kills the headlights as we approach, the last few hundred yards covered under the cloak of the vehicle's silent glide. We park a good distance away, out of sight but not out of mind. Each step towards the chapel is measured, deliberate, our boots crunching softly against the dry earth.

"Keep your eyes peeled," I mutter to Audrey, scanning the windows of the chapel. They're dark, empty sockets in the fading daylight, giving nothing away. But I can't shake the feeling of being watched.

Martinez, who insisted on coming along, signals to his team. Two agents move to flank the building, their steps as silent as the grave. Another pair positions themselves at the back, cutting off any chance of escape. We're not just walking into a potential trap; we're ready to spring one of our own.

I nod to Audrey, and together we step up to the heavy, wooden front door of the chapel. It's slightly ajar, the dark interior beckoning us inside with an ominous promise. I push the door open with the barrel of my 12 gauge shotgun, letting the dim light from outside reveal the chapel's secrets.

The inside of the chapel is as dilapidated as the outside. Pews are overturned and graffiti mars much of the wall space. But it's the smell that hits us first—a mix of mold, decay, and something faintly metallic. Blood? It wouldn't surprise me.

Our lights sweep across the walls, catching on crude graffiti that speaks of dark rituals. Amidst the chaos, my beam settles on the altar at the far end of the chapel. Above it hangs an inverted cross on the wall, its wood aged and splintered, swaying slightly as if recently disturbed.

I gesture to Audrey, pointing towards the cross. "There," I whisper, my voice barely audible. Martinez, just a few steps behind, nods, his expression grim.

With a nod, I crouch down, pushing aside a pile of debris to reveal a small, rectangular area that's been disturbed recently. The dirt is looser here, contrasting with the compacted filth around it. I use my hands, the cool soil sifting through my fingers, until they meet the hard edges of something solid.

"Found something," I announce, my voice low and steady despite the pounding in my chest. The others gather around as I pull out a small, wooden box. It's old, the wood swollen from moisture, but it's what's inside that counts.

I open the box slowly, hinges creaking quietly in the heavy silence of the chapel. Inside, a collection of bones lies in disarray—femurs, ribs, vertebrae, each more chilling than the last. They are not uniform; their sizes and shapes vary, suggesting they belong to different individuals. Each bone bears the scars of violence, with cut marks and scrapes where flesh was once forcibly stripped. It's a gruesome patchwork of human remains, each piece telling a silent, horrific story of its own.

Audrey, her face pale under the beam of her flashlight, catalogs each piece on her camera with a clinical detachment necessary to keep the horror at bay. "We need to get these to the lab," she says, her voice steady. "Each one of these could help us identify a victim, piece together this bastard's history."

I start rearranging the bones into a spiral on the hardwood floor, more out of a forensic interest than any desire to play into the killer's narrative. Audrey watches closely, her camera clicking at intervals, capturing each phase of the arrangement. The pattern emerges slowly, a grim sort of artistry in the way the larger bones curve outward, tapering to the smaller ones at the center. It's macabre, and deeply unsettling, yet there's a method to this madness, a clue perhaps.

As I place the last bone, a small, oddly shaped skull at the heart of the spiral, I feel a sense of dread pooling in my gut. The arrangement is too deliberate, each piece interlocking with the others in a way that suggests not just violence, but ritual.

As I finish arranging the bones, the radio crackles to life, breaking the heavy silence of the chapel. "Team two to team one, come in," Sergeant Rodríguez's voice is urgent, cutting through the static.

I grab the radio, pressing the transmit button. "This is team one, go ahead, sergeant."

"We've got something here," Rodríguez reports, his voice tense. "You need to see this."

Audrey scrambles to set up the live feed on her laptop. The screen flickers to life, showing grainy, night-vision images from the cameras mounted on the team’s helmets. The footage is shaky, the camera angles shaky as each team member turns this way and that. The screen splits into multiple views, each one a chaotic snapshot of the quarry's rocky terrain. The harsh, white outlines of rocks and sparse vegetation jump out against the black background, but there’s something else—movements, too fluid and quick to be human.

My stomach churns as the camera on Rodríguez’s helmet stabilizes for a moment, giving us a clear view. It’s a cavernous space carved into the side of the quarry, the walls rough and echoing the chaos outside. And there, mounted on the walls, are racks filled with human heads, their lifeless eyes staring out into the dark, empty space.

The lower racks hold skulls long stripped of flesh, each one bleached white by time and exposure. But the top rack... the top rack is a fresh set of horrors, heads of victims in various stages of decay, their features frozen in silent screams of agony.

The sounds that flood the live feed next are unlike any I've heard in years of service— a blood curdling screech that pierces the air, followed by a flurry of panicked shouts and the unmistakable staccato of gunfire. Audrey and I watch helplessly, the images on the screen a chaotic jumble as Rodríguez and his team struggle to respond.

"Sergeant, talk to me!" I bark into the radio, gripping the handset so tightly my knuckles turn white.

There's a crackle of static, then a strained voice comes through. "It's—fuck—it's got me! I can't—" I can hear Rodriguez scream in agony, the sort of sound that tells you it's not just pain, but raw, primal fear.

Through the grainy night-vision footage, glimpses of the assailant flash intermittently—a blur of movement too swift to be clearly seen. But then, the camera jerks as Rodríguez falls to the ground, the view tilting crazily before stabilizing skyward. In that brief, haunting moment, we see it—a creature with a sharp, elongated beak and massive talons, swooping down with the ferocity of a raptor.

The chaos on the screen abruptly turns into a horrifying stillness. As the screams and gunfire die down, the camera attached to Rodríguez's helmet captures a terrifying close-up. His head is pinned to the rocky ground by razor-sharp talons, the creature's grip unyielding. Blood pools around his neck, stark against the pale, moonlit rocks.

​​a voice breaks through, ethereal and chilling, coming from just off-screen. The night-vision feed blurs for a moment, then refocuses, and though the figure speaking isn't visible, the voice envelops us, clear and disturbingly calm.

"You were warned," the voice says, its tone almost conversational but underlaid with a cold seriousness. "Instructions were given. Not just to be heard, but to be followed, Detective Castillo."

Audrey and I exchange a look, a mix of disbelief and terror as the killer called me out by name.

"Who are you? How do you know my name?" I demand, my voice steady despite the uncertainty that grips me.

"I am a herald of the Fifth Sun, a harbinger of rebirth and destruction. This world, this era—it's ending, and the new cycle must be initiated," the voice answers enigmatically.

The talons around Rodríguez tighten, a grotesque adjustment that elicits another stifled scream from him, barely audible over the crackling radio. "Please," his voice is a ragged whisper, a plea drowned out by the voice of the assailant.

“Complete the ritual, Detective,” the killer commands. “I won’t ask again.”

Audrey grips my arm, her fingers tight. “Ramón, we can’t... we can’t go along with this. It’s madness.”

I nod at Audrey, my mind racing. "We need to buy time," I murmur, keeping my voice low as I scan the chapel.

I grab a candle from the altar, the wax firm and cold in my grip. With a flick of my zippo, the wick catches fire, casting a flickering, unsteady light that throws long shadows across the chapel's decrepit walls. I lower the candle into the eye socket of the skull positioned at the center of the spiral of bones. The small flame seems absurdly delicate in the vast, dark emptiness of the space.

The light from the candle shivers as if it senses the weight of the darkness around it. The skull's hollow sockets stare back at us, the flame reflected like a tiny beacon in the depths of its eyeless gaze. "It's done," I say, my voice echoing slightly off the stone walls, more to convince myself that we're still in control than anything else.

“Álcese, Quetzalcóatl," (Arise, Quetzalcoatl,)  the voice says, its tone laced with an edge that makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

With a sudden, sickening pop, the killer's talons tighten around Rodriguez's head, crushing it with terrifying ease. Blood sprays across the rocky ground, spattering the camera lens and obscuring the footage.

Before we can process the brutality that unfolded, a sound chills us to my core—the rattling of bones, not from the feed, but right behind us in the chapel. We whirl around, weapons raised, my heart pounding in my throat.

The bones on the chapel floor tremble and clack against each other with a sound like distant thunder. As we watch, frozen in place, they begin to assemble themselves, each piece moving with unnatural precision. The larger bones form a base, spiraling upwards, stacking into a tight, serpentine coil that rises from the ground like some grotesque monument.

The coil thickens, and then flesh begins to appear, manifesting out of the chill, damp air. It wraps around the bones like clay being molded by an unseen potter’s hands. The flesh is pale and slick, glistening under the dim light as if it were wet. Muscles twitch and contract as they form, binding to the bones with sinewy snaps that echo in the hollow chapel.

The creature’s body elongates, stretching out into a serpentine form, while scales start to cover the newly formed flesh, shimmering under the dim light of our flashlights. The scales are an iridescent array of colors, shifting from green to a vibrant turquoise, each one catching the light like a gemstone.

As the final touch, bright, needle-like feathers sprout along its spine, framing its form in a mockery of regal splendor.

The creature's head forms last, with a jaw that splits distantly reminiscent of a snake’s, capable of dislocating to swallow large prey. Yet, its eyes, when they open, are undeniably human, deep and intelligent.

Audrey lets out a strangled cry, covering her mouth with her hand as she turns away from the screen. I feel bile rising in my throat, the horror of the situation hitting me like a physical blow.

The creature's feathers, bright and sharp as blades, fluff aggressively—a clear prelude to an imminent attack. My voice is sharp as I shout, "Take cover!" to my team.

As the feathers detach and hurtle towards us like a hail of arrows, I drive behind an overturned pew just as the feathers thud into where I stood mere seconds ago. The wood splinters loudly under the impact, the fragments peppering the air like shrapnel.

An agonized scream pierces the chaos. I spin around, expecting to see Audrey safely huddled behind me, but my heart sinks as my eyes find her instead lying vulnerable in the center aisle. Her body is twisted awkwardly, her face contorted in pain as she clutches her left arm, blood soaking through her fingers and staining the cold stone floor.

A few feet away, Martinez lay motionless, a dark pool expanding around him. A feather had torn right through his chest with brutal efficiency, the tip protruding from his back, pinning him to the ground like a grotesque specimen in a collection.

Audrey, pale and grimacing in pain, meets my eyes across the room. There's an unspoken understanding between us, a shared history of close calls and narrow escapes, but nothing like this.

Peeking out from my makeshift shelter, the eerie silence of the chapel weighs heavily, broken only by a low hissing sound and the distant drip of blood echoing off stone. The creature slithers with sinuous grace between the shadows, its scales catching the dim light, creating a tapestry of light and darkness across the floor.

I know the monster is using her as bait. It wants us out in the open so it can finish us off. But I can’t leave Audrey to die, not like this, not when I might still [help](https://new.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/1cu31vv/broken_dawn/) [her](https://new.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/1bg4l0g/i_found_out_why_my_dad_never_talked_about_his/).
