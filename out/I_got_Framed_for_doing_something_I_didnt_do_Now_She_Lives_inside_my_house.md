(I'm sorry for my bad English, its not my native language)

When I was 17, or something like that, I had a friend. She was my only friend, lets name her "Clara".

She was the kindest person i met. Everyday she came with gifts for me and she protected me from bullies. I got enough courage to stand up everyday thanks to her, but something happened one day.

I was walking down The hall of my school. I saw Clara talking to one of her friends and then she came close to me.  
"Hey, I need help with something"  
She grabbed by hand and brought me to the Girls Locker room. I tried resisting, but she kept grabbing onto me without hesitation. She pushed me inside and she started taking of her clothes. I tried to run but she tied my up with a rope. She then proceeded to be half naked and then untied me. She tied herself.  
"Help! Help! Someone's Trying to Assault me!"  
I tried to run away, but as soon as I did a teacher came. No doubt, I got Sent to the office. I got the police called on and sued.  
My Father and Mother Started hitting me as soon as I got home. I also got disowned.

I lived on the streets for the past days. I was only 17 and I had already gone through this harsh treatment, What a lucky man am I?  
My parents managed to pay the Lawsuit but I my life was still shattered. It all happened so suddenly, yet so much happened. I managed to find a place where I could stay in, not a home but a sewer. The sewer had some bags and items I could turn into a bed. I stayed living there. I tried running for jobs, but my criminal record didn't let me. I Gave up, There's nothing I could do huh?

There was one work place where I was accepted. Its a small company that doesn't have much employees to work with. The Manager told me I could work there, for no apparent reason. He didnt care about my Record for some reason. I signed to join the company and proceeded to work there. My job was simple, Be a Deskman. My Payment wasn't bad. I actually got decent payment and saved up enough to live in a house.

3 Years have passed since that day, I got a random Call in my phone. I thought it was my manager, since I didn't have him saved. When I answered, There was heavy breathing.  
"Please... Come... To... Me..."  
The voice sounded like a woman in her 20s. She repeated the phrase over and over again.

Of course I hanged up. There's no reason that I should pick up. I came to my home tired. And heard heavy moaning in the closet.  
"Somebody There?" I said. I got close to the closet and opened it. No one was there. I found some pair of Pants I didn't leave there in the morning, So I knew something happened. This routine happened more and more often. Somebody in my closet kept moaning and when they heard my steps, they stayed silent and left somehow. The Moans were female moans. So thats a clue.

I tried many different methods, Shooting the closet without making any noise from my steps, Running as fast as I can and trying to catch whoever is inside it, etc. None of them worked.

After 2 weeks of this happening, Whoever was inside there, started leaving notes inside the closet. The first note read as follows.  
"Little Riddle for you, I know your a smart guy. I knew you before, I stalked you before, I ruined you before. Guess who it is?". That text only reminded me of one person. Clara.

"CLARA!" I screamed. I heard running through the window. I found a small hole inside the closet, where a human could fit. The noise came from there.  
I crouched down and grabbed my gun, I started going as fast as I can. I found a human silhouette waiting for me at the other side of the tunnel, but I didn't mind it back then. That was a grave mistake.

I exited the tunnel and found a girl. Yellow Hair, Brown eyes, Tall. It was Clara. She had a Baseball bat next to her, she proceeded to knock me down. I woke up, she started to talk to me in a soft tone.  
"Where have you been... After all this time... Where have you been..."  
The gun I had disappeared. I was tied up to a chair and couldn't move. My mouth was taped and All she heard was muffled screams for help.

She started touching me in weird ways and just looked weird overall. I tried moving as hard as I can. But after that, I cant remember anything. I woke up and I was in my bed, Naked. My head hurts. Everything stopped, the moaning, the weird calls.

Why cant I remember?
