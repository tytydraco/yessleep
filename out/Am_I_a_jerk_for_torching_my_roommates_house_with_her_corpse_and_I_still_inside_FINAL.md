I, um… excuse me if this post lacks the levity of previous entries ([Part 1,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11nz6qy/am_i_a_jerk_for_refusing_to_participate_in_my/) [Part 2,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ryj2m/my_roommates_creepy_doll_went_viral_am_i_a_jerk/) [Part 3,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11t1v9z/am_i_a_jerk_for_burning_my_roommates_creepy/) [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11v6pdc/am_i_a_jerk_for_asking_my_roommate_to_pay_half/)). I don’t even know why I’m updating… what truly is the point? A question that really is the central premise of my philosophy degree, so you’d think, having spent so many hours pondering the meaning of it all, I might have some kind of answer, haha…

Turns out, when confronted with death… everything just… dissolves into meaninglessness. So here I am, all out of jokes… (Well, not *entirely* out. I have a separate document with all my philosophy jokes, and haven’t even gotten to the pickup lines… wanna make like Marx and seize my means of reproduction?)

Wow. That probably wasn’t funny even *before* everything lost all meaning… sorry.

Well. Here we go. One last time.

**Life Loses all Meaning:**

Loyal readers will remember that PsychicDeathLady123, aka Marge, was scheduled for an appointment with us this afternoon. Unfortunately, she relayed to me that car trouble delayed her arrival to closer to 9pm or even tomorrow. I’m not sure if a more punctual appointment would have made a difference, since it’s hard to imagine some kooky middle-aged huckster dealing with an actual demon—but who knows? Maybe her broken alternator is the single event in the universe that makes a difference between life and death. Anyway, it’s… it’s a bit too late now.

Three hours ago, 5pm. Curt was still away on some trip he left on a couple days ago. I needed some air, so I went out. I ended up going for a walk, wishing Curt would arrive home because I was so anxious, just on pins and needles, every nerve jangling. I didn’t want to come back inside to face whatever was with Karen on my own. Maybe I was feeling some sort of… premonition. But eventually, it got too cold out. When I got back, the curtains were drawn and the blinds closed. I came into the living room and it was dark. Karen was standing *right there.* A shadow just standing in the dark room. I almost shit myself.

“Jesus, Karen—”

“Where’s Binky?” she demanded.

“I moved her—”

“Why?” she snarled. “Binky’s mine! How DARE you touch her—"

“You were acting strange! You still are—”

“*I’m* acting strange? *You’re* the one who took my phone, keeps sneaking around, and stole my fucking hamster! Well I had my sister bring her back while you were out on your little walk. She’s in my room now, you psycho! And if you so much as set foot inside my room—"

“Karen—”

“No, do *NOT* ‘Karen’ me! You’ve been acting like a lunatic all day, and yesterday, and ever since that damned ceremony! You haven’t slept, have done nothing but drink coffee and type on your laptop. I *just* saw you pacing around back and forth outside in the dark like some kind of creeper—"

As she yelled, I realized she was right. My behavior *had* been strange. But also she was wrong. My behavior was the behavior of someone frightened. And I took out my phone—she may have *sounded* normal, but something in the way she gesticulated was… stilted. *Off*. I snapped a picture. I didn’t see the knife in her hand. I swear. In the dim, the flash went off automatically.

Karen shrieked, throwing a hand up.

When I could see again, she was gone. Then motion above drew my eyes upward.

Karen was *on the ceiling.* Eyes rolled back in her head. Mouth gaping as if she had lost control of her jaw, like a puppet on which the hinge is loose. Her face slack. She moved two crawling steps above me on the ceiling like a spider. Hair dangling almost enough to brush my face. I caught only the briefest, nightmarish glimpse before she dropped on me.

I screamed.

I don’t remember the next moments… just that she straddled me, and I struggled with her for the knife. I… I… I swear I didn’t see her eyes flicker onto me until it was too late. It all happened so fast. Somehow… I, I don’t know… somehow… shit… I’m crying as I write this. For a second, she got this look in her eyes. “Hey,” she said, all confused at me. “What are you—” and then I stabbed her in the chest with the knife we were both holding, and she made this sort of gasping sound, and I backed out from under her.

“Oh god, Oh god Karen!” I gasped.

She fell over. She…

Her body is still there. Still there on the floor, blood pooling underneath, staining the carpet.

Now I look at her empty eyes. All I can feel is a profound, unutterable hollowness in my chest. How vacant those eyes are…

**Ready Player Two:**

I don’t know why I’m bothering with headers. It’s like I can’t turn it off. The part of my brain that’s like, “Ooh, this would make a good subheading” or, “hey let’s throw in one of your philosophy jokes” is still active, even though nothing actually matters anymore.

I found gas cans in Curt’s garage. Who woulda thunk? (Actually, me. Which is why I looked there for them. Also, for what I am about to do, I’m sorry, Curt. Fwiw, you can keep my security deposit.)

See, there’s one more thing I have to do. Well… two things, if you count writing this post. I figured I’d… heh… figured I’d post one last time… wrap things up… let *you* know, at least, fellow spooky-kookies. Let you know so when you read about me in the news, and learn my real name (shockingly, it’s not Plato), you’ll know the truth. I have to end this game. I can’t risk Marge, or Curt, or the police showing up here when I’m not… when I’m not myself. Which is obviously where all this is leading. So I’m going to end the game by removing all the players.

I’m so sorry, Binky. I’m so sorry, Karen. So, so sorry. This is all my fault… she wanted to stop. After I’d set up the cameras and Boo Boy was walking around, she got nervous and thought about ending it… I wanted to get proof so badly. “Look, Karen, you yourself said this could be the greatest discovery of all time. Now let’s just get the footage. The first footage ever of a supernatural occurrence, and on *your* channel! Think about it!”

*I* convinced *her* to keep playing.

*I* fought to keep going until I got the picture.

YTA. It makes no difference, calling it now, but YTA. YTA.

And now I’m… doing the right thing. I deleted the picture.

No one else will see it. Which means no one else will fall under possession by this… thing. There will never be any players but us.

I’m taking care of everything, Karen, so don’t worry. Everything’s A-okay.

**Last Words:**

This is it. All that’s left is to light the match. Whatever I type next will be my last words, and… I cannot for the death of me fucking think of an appropriate phrase to go out on.

I know, I know. It’s dumb. I’ve spent an inordinate amount of time (I mean, relatively, given how little I have left) staring at the screen, trying to come up with some kind of pithy final line.

Don’t be like Plato, kids. Plan your last words early.

All right. This post is ready to go, and most of the links updated. The last ones I’ll do once it’s up.

Still no profound last words. Shit. At this point I’m just prevaricating because I’m terrified, so—I am going to hurry and do this thing now. Here we go. Lighting it up.

This experienced has sucked, by the way. 0/10. [Would not play again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
