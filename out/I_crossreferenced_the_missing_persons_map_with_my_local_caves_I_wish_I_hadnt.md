You’ve probably seen this map too, it pops up on Reddit every few months, usually on r/creepy or r/MapPorn. It shows two images: one is a map of missing persons  and the other is a map of America’s subterranean cave systems. The overlap is practically identical. The caverns  match the disappearances almost 1:1.  
  
Most people look at it, go "huh, creepy," and scroll past. I used to, too.  
  
But this time I zoomed in.  
  
I live in a rural stretch of Kentucky, deep in the foothills. I noticed a dense cluster of red dots right in my county, sitting directly on top of a "minor" cavern system called the Blackwood Sinkholes. It wasn't a tourist trap like Mammoth Cave. It was a jagged scar in the woods that even locals didn’t bother with.

I showed it to my girlfriend, Jess. Calling Jess outdoorsy would be putting it lightly. She’s the kind of girl who owns three different types of hiking boots and thinks a weekend without dirt under her fingernails is a wasted one. I’m the opposite; I stay up until 3 AM reading about unsolved murders and just generally being a vampire.  
  
"It’s a match, see?" I pointed at the screen. "Nobody goes missing here because they get lost. They fall in. Or..." I waggled my eyebrows, "Something pulls them in."

Jess rolled her eyes but grinned. "You want to go ghost hunting?"  
  
"I want to go debunking," I corrected. "We hike out, set up camp near the sinkholes, cook some actual food and drink some bourbon and see if the Mothman shows up.” 

It was supposed to be fun. A mix of her love for nature and my morbid curiosity. We packed the Jeep on Friday. Tents, sleeping bags, and a heavy cooler filled with marinated short ribs and ice for the whiskey.

The hike to the Blackwood sinks was only about three miles from the nearest logging road, but the terrain was brutal. The trees grew thick and wrong here, their roots twisting over the limestone ground like arthritic fingers. By the time we found the main entrance, the sun was already dipping below the ridge.

The cave mouth was a horizontal slash in a limestone cliff face, about ten feet high and thirty feet wide. It looked like a mouth held open in a silent scream. A steady, cold breeze flowed out of it, smelling of wet rock and old copper.

"Creepy," Jess noted, dropping her pack. "I can dig it."

I loved this girl.

We set up camp about fifty yards from the entrance, just far enough to avoid the draft but close enough to stare into the darkness. I got the fire going while Jess prepped the grill grate over the coals. We were doing this right, slow-cooked sticky ribs, slathered in a spicy bourbon sauce.

Heat from gentle coals licked at the meat and the smell was intoxicating. Anyone who loves BBQ knows what I’m talking about. Smoke, fat, sugar, and char. Jess was walking back from the tent with the drinks when a downdraft caught the smoke, pulling the plume low across the ground and sucking it into the mouth of the cave.

"Feeding the beast?" Jess joked while handing me a solo cup half filled with Knob Creek.

"Hope they like ribs" I laughed.

We ate as the sunset turned to twilight and then drank as twilight gave way to pitch black. Jess put her hand on my shoulder. I was thought I was going to get lucky then she told me to shush. That’s when I heard the silence. All day there was a symphony of crickets, cicadas, and rustling leaves. But now  the silence was thick, heavy and oppressive. It felt like the forest was holding its breath.

And then the cave moaned. At first you could probably mistake it for the wind, it was too low and too long of a groan to come from any human lungs. Then it got louder and closer.

Jess whispered low, "Did you hear that?" And it took me everything I had to not tremble.

She shone her flashlight toward the cliff. The beam cut through the darkness, but the cave mouth swallowed the light. 

"Probably a coyote. Or a bear. We should pack the food up tight." I murmured back, more to myself than her.

"That didn't sound like a bear. That sounded... congested."

We started scrambling to clean up. I was tossing the bones into a trash bag when the sound changed. It wasn't moaning now. It was a retching noise. A wet, hacking cough that echoed from deep within the rock.

Then a voice. Or, something trying to be a voice.

"Come..."

Maybe it wasn't English. Maybe my mind was trying find meaning where there weren’t none. It sounded like two stones grinding together.

Jess dropped the cooler lid. "What the hell was that?"

I grabbed the hatchet I’d used for firewood. "We’re leaving. Now."

"The tent..."

"Leave it."

The smell hit us before we saw them. It wasn't the lingering sweet smoke of our BBQ anymore. It was a wave of rot. Rancid meat, ammonia, and something muskier, like a wet dog that had been dead for days.

From the darkness of the cave, they came.

They weren't human. They were wrong... elongated. That’s the only word for it. They looked like humans who had been stretched on a rack. Pale skin pulled tight over bones that had too many joints. Their eyes were milky white, useless and blind. Long rot-stained teeth, chipped and broken and jagged stuck out from low hanging jaws that were too wide and too loose.And there were three of them. Two of crawled on the ground and the third one limped in a jerky motion all insect like.

They went straight for the grill.

One of them grabbed the scorching hot grate with a bare, clawed hand. It didn't even flinch as its skin sizzled. It brought the metal to its face and groaned, licking the grease with a tongue that was too long and too black.

"Don't move," I whispered, terrified that the sound of my heartbeat would give us away.

The creature let out a chittering sound, dropping the grate. It turned its head. It wasn't looking at us, it was blind I could tell, but it was looking for us. It tilted its head, sniffing the air like a hungry dog. It was smelling for us.

And then it arched its back and wailed. It was a nails on chalk board, teeth grinding, bone chilling screech that shot down my ears and prickled at something in my gut. It opened its too wide mouth and I saw my death.

"Meeeeaaat," it rasped.

I threw the bag of trash at them. It was instinct. The bag hit the screecher in the chest, spilling rib bones and paper towels.

The distraction worked for a second. The three of them fell upon the ribs and garbage in a frenzy, I could hear them snapping the bones with audible crunches.

"Run!" I screamed.

We sprinted through the dark woods. We tripped over roots, slammed into saplings, and tore our clothes on briars. Behind us, the snapping of bones stopped, replaced by a high-pitched, ululating shriek that sounded like something between a coyote and a sobbing child.

I could hear them crashing through the brush behind us. They were fast. So incredibly fast.

We burst onto the logging road just as I threw the keys to Jess. We dove into the Jeep. She slammed the locks just as something heavy slammed into the rear window.

The glass spiderwebbed but held. I looked back as Jess peeled out, dirt and gravel spraying everywhere.

In the red glow of the taillights, I saw them. The treeline was filled with them. Some were standing in the middle of the road, dead still, just watching. There was so many.

We drove in silence until we hit the highway.

We didn't report it. Who would believe us? We told our friends we got spooked by a cougar.

But I went back to the map today. I looked at that cluster of red dots in my county and I looked at the timeline.

Most of the disappearances happen in the summer. Memorial Day. Fourth of July. Labor Day.

Holidays.

Holidays where people go outside. Where people light fires. Where people cook meat.

I’d thought the maps overlap because people fall into holes.

It’s not.

The cave systems aren't just holes in the ground. They’re ventilation shafts. And when we play and laugh and cook barbecue, we’re ringing the dinner bell.
