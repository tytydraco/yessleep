This is the testimony of Brandon who was visited in his dream by the Lord Jesus Christ where he was shown the events of the great tribulation. This was in 2014. I understand the perspectives that people may have on this subject, so at least keep an open mind and I hope this post guides some or becomes a reminder to others in the near future where peace will cease and chaos will spread. May Jesus bless your souls.

The world is about to change. The world governments will be met by a figure that will be handed authority on all nations. The reason he will be handed all authority is because the people get thirsty for peace that they lacked for a time. The sense of peace that the figure will bring will be false but the people will follow. God’s grace will leave Earth since Jesus is present when people had prayed in his name during their stay. The Christians will disappear and that figure of authority will explain that those Christians “were taken in punishment by the aliens.” In reality they were raptured. The figure will first appear in Berlin. He will change the world’s nations’ flags into one with green, white and black with golden swords which each of them will represent a terrorist group such as Isis. Those time frames will come very soon. 

The aforementioned figure will mandate every person to bring his bible into a police station or certain fields where they will be stacked and burnt. He will mandate his own worship on Fridays and wearing white garments. The people left on earth are all walking in order and are dead inside. The mark of the beast will be handed out which will send hormonal feedback that will calm any person down. The Muslims around the world will scream that “El Mahdi” has come, not realizing that he himself is the devil and a political figure that will appear on tv soon. The Christians left on earth will make colonies and run to the mountains and caverns. They will dig fox holes to hide from ample amounts of drones that read body heat and sends a signal to the mark that is implemented in the body which will give back a signal of safety in return which means the person has the mark. The mark will be forced at the entrances of towns and cities. Or any places where living is allowed.

 Christians who ran away after the rapture “aliens” will be forced to take the mark lest they want their head cut off on the spot. The false Christians who take the mark will spread a lukewarm Gospel in which Jesus will reply to “ depart from me, you workers of lawlessness” Matthew 7:23. The unfolding of those events are about the begin and Jesus is returning very soon. Repent for the Lord loves you very much. God will banish those evil forces soon enough. Have faith in Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Btw I’m not a bot I’m just spreading awareness since a lot will not even believe this even though they will soon live through it and think that taking the mark will be okay. It won’t be since it will make you calm and unable to want to panic and cut your arm or attempt in one ending his own life. Even then, it is already too late.
