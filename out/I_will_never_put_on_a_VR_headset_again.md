I will never put on a VR headset again.

I’ve always loved VR. It’s been part of my life for years, something I look forward to when classes and work get overwhelming. When my wife and I moved into our townhome for school, we got lucky. There was a spare room upstairs with just enough open floor space to move around freely. I turned it into my VR room and my study space. We kept some clothes in there too, hanging on racks along the wall. It always felt a little…still. Like the air never circulated all the way into the corners. But it worked.

That weekend my wife went to visit her family. I stayed behind. Just me in the house. Quiet.

I decided I was going to finish Resident Evil 4 VR. I’d been playing it off and on for weeks, and I was near the end. The headset wrapped around me and the real world faded away. I was totally absorbed. The kind of gameplay where you forget your physical body is even standing in a room. The sound, the controls, the flashlight glow scraping across dark hallways it didn’t feel like playing anymore. It felt like being there.

Then I heard something behind me.

Not in game.
In the room.
A soft shuffle, like someone adjusting their feet on carpet.

I took off the headset immediately.

Nothing seemed out of place. Clothes racks still. Desk untouched. The door was cracked open just a little. The house was silent. I checked the hallway. The bathroom. The rooms downstairs. I even stood in the kitchen for a minute, listening.

Nothing.
Just nothing.

I went back upstairs, telling myself it was just my brain playing tricks after being so focused. When I put the headset back on, I didn’t go back to Resident Evil. I didn’t want anything dark. I didn’t want to feel watched anymore. So I switched to Onward, a military shooter. Something structured, tactical, grounded. Safe.

At least, that’s what I told myself.

I was mid-match when I stepped too far back. My foot crossed the boundary line, and the VR instantly switched to passthrough mode the grainy black and white feed of the real room.

The door was open wider than I remembered.

And in that doorway, for just a second, I saw what looked like a shadow standing there. Not a trick of light. Not a smudge. A human-shaped shadow, motionless.

I tore the headset off.

The doorway was empty.

I walked downstairs again. I walked through every room. I even opened the front door and checked outside. I stood there breathing, trying to calm my heart, telling myself it was the cameras glitching. I repeated that to myself over and over because the alternative didn’t make sense.

I went back up, shut the door, and tried to relax. Just a glitch. Just adrenaline.

I put the headset back on.

And right as I picked up the controllers, I felt something behind me.

Not a grab. Not even a clear touch.
More like the air suddenly pressed against my back, like someone had leaned in close. And then a breath. A slow exhale that brushed across the back of my neck.

Every hair on my body stood up.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t move. I just stood there with my hands frozen mid-air, trying not to turn around.

When I finally took the headset off, the room was empty again. I left. I didn’t even turn the light off.

I went downstairs, turned on Star Wars: A New Hope, and sat there for hours. Watching something familiar calmed me down. It made things feel normal again. Believable. Safe.

And after a while… I forgot how scared I had been.

Watching Star Wars made me want to play VR again. Something fun. Something familiar. So I went back upstairs to play Vader Immortal.

I didn’t even think to close the door behind me.

Once I was in VR again, I didn’t want to take the headset off because as long as I was in VR, I could tell myself everything I had experienced was camera distortion. Audio artifacts. A tired brain. A trick of perspective. The headset was easier to believe than reality.

Then I heard something downstairs.

This time, it wasn’t subtle. It was a step. Weight on a stair.

Without taking off the headset, I walked toward the sound. I crossed the boundary. Passthrough activated.

I was standing at the top of the staircase, looking down through the glitchy grayscale feed.

Something was standing at the bottom of the stairs.

It shifted slowly, like it had just noticed me too.

I couldn’t breathe. I don’t know how long I stood there.

The air in the room got cold. Not like the AC kicked in. More like the temperature was being pulled out of the air itself. My skin prickled. I felt the sharp cold fill my lungs with my quickening breaths. 

I backed away. Step by step. Into the VR room. I closed the door.

When I turned around, the VR environment was still fading back in, but passthrough flickered for just a moment.

And I saw it right in front of me.

It wasn’t a shadow anymore. It was more real than the room. Lower jaw separated at the hinge, skin torn like it had been peeled and dried in strips, chest caved in and reassembled wrong as if something was wearing a human shape without understanding how humans are supposed to look.

Its face was close. Inches from mine.
The air around me dropped again, freezing, and I felt that same breath on my cheek.

I don’t remember taking the headset off. I just remember being outside on the porch and the sky starting to lighten.

My wife doesn’t believe me.
Maybe I wouldn’t either.

But I know what I felt.
Something was in that room with me.
And it was waiting for me to take the headset off so I could see it clearly.

I will never put on a VR headset again.
