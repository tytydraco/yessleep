I still remember that old town. Albeit, I wish I didn’t. I wish I couldn’t remember how the wind blew through the trees and the dripping of the rain as it left the gutter. I tried to forget, I’ve tried relentlessly to short circuit my brain with black tar heroin and cocaine. I’ve tried to entirely replace my bad blood with it more times than I’d like to admit. 




When I was six, my dad lost his contracting job. The tears he shed, the sounds of his sobs as he talked about the fear of losing our home have been burned into my brain ever since. I still remember how hard my mom had worked to find a job, but due to the cost of living in our large city and her lack of education, she wasn’t able to support us. The only job she managed to find was a job as a worker for a live stock farm in some small Kentucky town. 

At around ten in the morning, our car pulled into a small dirt driveway. The house was actually rather nice, it was painted a light blue- although some areas had begun to chip- and the trims along the windows had been painted with just enough care to prevent dripping. I was the first to step out of the car, according to my mother I’d always been the first to explore new places. 

“It’s… certainly something.” My father had said, opening up the door as he stepped out too. He had been in the passengers seat, as he was severely hung over from a night of excessive drinking. 

“It’s not bad, honey.” She’d replied curtly, grabbing her luggage from the trunk as she stepped towards the door and pushed it open. My eyes had immediately scanned the inside as I ran in front of her, she nearly tripped over me as I did so.



The years passed with very little notable change, our town had remained uneventful for a very long time, the only things that had been remarkable were the few missing people that had popped up on occasion. My father remained an alcoholic and my mother remained a kind, yet subtly neglectful woman. I only had one close friend in my childhood and teen years, he was a boy my age. Unlike mine, his family had lived in the same town for generations, to the point most people knew who he was just off his last name. The Obsorn family was one of those families where no one was sure where they had gained their wealth, people just accepted that they had it. Also unlike me, Kayce Osborn was a complete social butterfly. During our freshman year of high school, he dragged me along to at least ten bonfires and house parties. I still remember the way his smile lit up his face when he looked at me, the little dimple that formed lopsidedly on the left half of his perfect face. 

My "normal teen life" as I called it, had came to an abrupt end on my seventeenth birthday. 

"Hey, Fin's mom," I heard Kayce's voice from my reclined position on the couch, "is he home?" I knew damn well that Kayce had known I was home, as I was always home. 

"I'm here!"

"Dude, you're like, hella old now." The sixteen year old said as he peeked his head in the door. "Hella old and still jobless." It wasn't like I didn't want a job, I just didn't know where to work. I'd tried to work for the ranch once when I was fifteen, but I'd found it too strange- as there were very few cows and yet the town practically lived off the meat they sold. After that, I just stayed jobless. Kayce glanced over at my mom with a look that she knew too well, a silent way of asking her if we could hang out. 

We spent that whole day driving and walking around the town and the surrounding scenic areas. At around eleven that night, Kayce sighed and stretched his arms as he popped his neck against the head rest. 

"My parents have me on an eleven thirty curfew tonight."

"Damn. Why? Since when have you had a curfew?"

"Man, hell if I know," Kayce had begun with a shrug, "you should just sneak in my window or something so we can still hang after my curfew." I had snuck in his window so many times that it was practically my second nature. 

"Okay, yeah. Let's do that. I don't feel like going home and enduring a drunken tirade on my birthday anyway." I said as I pulled out my phone to text my mom and let her know that I was going to stay over at Kayce's house. I started the car up again, driving in silence as Kayce stared out the widow. 

It wasn't exactly hard to find his house, it was the only mansion in town after all. The walls rose higher than the trees outside, three stories of beautiful architecture that I practically shared with my best friend.

Once he got out, I drove down the road and parked, waiting for him to enter the house before I stepped out too. His room was on the second story, but due to the ladder that his mom had put up to grow ivy and flowers on, as she thought it looked pretty, I was able to get up. I pulled the window open with some effort, climbing in and shutting it behind me before I went to hide under the bed. 

I could hear them talking from downstairs, although I couldn't make out the words. I felt bad for even attempting to, as I knew he'd tell me what they were talking about when he came up, but I couldn't help it. I was nosy. After around thirty minutes, which I spent scrolling on my phone, I heard the door creek open. The steps were slow, I could hear heavy and ragged breathing. I pulled away from the edge of the bed, thinking it was Kayce's parents, and inched closer to the wall. The painfully bright light shone through a crack in the door, barely visible behind the figure. Whoever it was took a few more agonizingly slow steps forward, the door shutting as the light disappeared from the small opening. I covered my mouth with my hand, I was sure that if I breathed too loud, whoever it was would catch me. As I did, the bed creaked beneath the weight of the person who'd positioned themselves on it. 

I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath, when I opened them, I was faced with the top of Kayce's head. Slowly, his face was revealed. 

I stared into wide eyes and for a moment, I was sure someone had killed and replaced my best friend. I didn't recognize that look. 

"Finny."

"Kayce?"

"Go home. No. Don't go home. Run. You have to run, run and never, ever come back."



I can't continue with my story, as much as I wish I could to just get it off my chest, just writing is making me feel sick to my stomach. Maybe I'll be able to tell the rest, maybe I'll die with the secrets of my little town.
