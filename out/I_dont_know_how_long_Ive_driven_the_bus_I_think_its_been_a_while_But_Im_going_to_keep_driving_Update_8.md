It called itself Lume. I asked em’ if they were willing to a wait a while. I wanted to let my Trainee rest up a bit still if she needed it. Her rollin’ and stirrin’ to see what was wrong was reassuring, but I feel like good rest and sure hearts need to go hand in hand.

Maybe that’s why I keep mucking things up. Maybe I don’t-

No, don’t you get thinking like that, J-

Hrm. Sorry, I’m just a little. Frazzled.

So, they say ‘yeah, okay’. Their voice is like a buzzing light if someone was trying real hard to make words out of it, and they somehow managed it. And they kind of hummed, like when you leave an old light on and you sit real quiet and. There it is. Bzz, but gentler. I didn’t know why, but I trusted them. Felt, even, like I owed them something. I went to sleep myself feeling all sad and wistful.

When I wake up, when I fix breakfast and I’m bout to go for the milk, I see one of the faces on the carton looks just like theirs. Now, I get concerned. It means one of three things, see. Either I let someone dangerous onto my bus, someone who had gone missing had just washed up onto my vehicle - these are not at all mutually exclusive, mind you now - or someone was trying to make me some kind of trade.

I go up, and they’re just sitting there. They seem to be… Switched off? Like when you pull a lamp and it goes out, but if it could pull its own cord. So it ‘blinks’ awake, I see a flash of its little head beaming yellow real watery till it’s bright and clear. I frown a bit. Not because I find it distasteful, but because it’s a real casual hazard to go waving about possibly shining in people’s eyes. And the definition of harmin’ folk can sometimes be very… Loose.

My Trainee goes up and yawns, and I look at her thinking how strange some of the folk I ride with are. I remember what she told me, and I’m thinking about the… Moon thing. I’ll be honest, I had a few other reasons for, erm, switching means of getting this out there. While I’m not 100% certain where these end up, I know that I can just keep a. Different copy, for myself. Cut out a few words and show her the other.

I know it’s kind of deceptive. I’m trying to keep my voice low because of it, not sure if you can hear that. We’re at that one hotel. Er, motel I mean. She wanted to… Have space. I don’t really… I don’t know. I don’t know what I can say. I can hear the moon whispering to me now. It’s one of the few things from that mall venture that’s 100% clear in my head. I guess it noticed it stuck, since right now it’s saying things down to me.

“Please. Don’t let them come back up. I did not mean to hurt them, I threw them down so they could not be.” That’s what I just heard.

I’ll… Get back on track, sorry.

My Trainee sits with that Lume fellow. It has a lot of little drawings in its hands, and when I look down, I see they look a lot like the ones I found down in my hatch. On the slips. Now, here’s the kicker. I see it writing a few words on some of them, but the writing style doesn’t match any of them. But, well, I don’t pry. I think it’s a friend, we exchanged the word between us, but you still don’t. Just do that.

Of course, that idea didn’t hold up long. I sit down, make sure it still wants to go where it told me. I check what it put in the box, and I see a little origami shape. It’s made of the same material Ori seemed to be, and had a little bit of… How to describe it. Inky-black, crimson-red on it. Like some kind of strange blood. I’m thinkin’ it was, in fact.

It looks like a cat.

“Did you… Make that?” I ask em’.

“No. That was my friend.”

That’s not a very enlightening term, in this instance. I feel this twinge of rememberin’ at the back of my mind, but it doesn’t swim all the way up. I decide to let it go, for a bit. I get this sinkin’ feelin’ in my guts. Enough of one, in fact, I can’t quite get myself to put into gear and get the bus goin’.

“...You wanna drive? The whole way, this time?” I’d done a couple goes with her, so figured the Trainee could handle the wheel a bit. It was a little selfish, but it was also important. And I’d rather not drive while I’m so sure I’m not going to be seein’ down the road quite so clearly.

She nods, gets up and takes the seat for me. I guide her slowly through the routine again, but she already seems to be getting it. “You drive before?” I ask her.

“Nothing like this. I’ve driven a buggy.”

“Like one of those… Those off-roading ones I’ve seen the wallers drivin’?”

“More a… Moony type of buggy.”

I don’t really know how to proceed with the convo, so I go a couple seats back and sit down. Somehow it feels like intruding, but I listen as she and the passenger start talking. I get antsy, like not driving means I’m abandoning a really important routine. I sort of am, but, well, that’s the point. No. Retiring, not… Abandoning. I would never abandon the bus. I get this strange thought like I’m sure a few other people wouldn’t, then doubt for one.

I don’t butt in. I’m too busy thinkin.’ I don’t fully pay attention, I find it hard right then, but I catch some. They talk about where they came from. The Trainee mentions a palace of some kind, and Lume talks about a dark place with lots of lights. A long, winding place, organized in particular ways. They mention being in the dark for a long time. Metaphorically, mostly, they clarify it’s pretty bright down there when their friend wants it to be. When they want it to be. They kinda shine their light to demonstrate, and the Trainee curses as she almost swerves, getting blasted in the eye with a yellow beam bouncing off the rear view.

I think she was trying to be friendly with em’, like I tried to be. And I think that soured her mood a little, since it was quiet, mostly, the rest of the way. We weren’t too far from some of the walls, my weather vane was pointing clear north. And the roads felt. Short. It was a longer ride than usual, though, since my Trainee can’t see it so she just drives through the regular. Eventually, we get to the walls, all tall and good, thick concrete and barbed.

There’s a lot of phrases running along the length of them. I don’t think I’ve ever really described them before, have I? If I look up, they kind of tower real tall, like someone ten times my height or more kept trying to hop it like a fence and they’d almost overcorrected. There’s these. Whatcha call em’. Wide booths, with glass windows, sittin’ every couple miles or so. Always someone - someone like me, something else - sittin’ there wearing something real casual or real formal, the latter all yellow and blue usually.

The walls, in their scratches, shout out things like ‘please mind your weapons’, ‘property is not given until its promised’, ‘it’s safe in here, we are civilized’. I think they’re more like a charm than a warning or whatnot. Like the ones I paste to my door and windows sometimes. I’ve driven almost blind before, you know, those things just. Crawling along the inside of my bus like I’d gone cuckoo bonkers.

There’s big old gate doors next to the window spots. They’ve got a real thick looking side door, too, but that’s just for the wall watchers. I’m pretty sure if I tried to drive through any part of it at full speed I’d smash my front in like a crushed can. That is to say, you probably aren’t getting in if they don’t want you in there, though long as you’re real respectable and not up to no good you can probably pass through.

I wait, just in case. I see my passenger get off, and I feel this guilt riding a wave of a twist in my guts and some real unmannerly relief. I get tense, like I do sometimes, send up a prayer, but for some reason I find myself feeling a hell of a lot more strongly about this particular soul gettin’ into those pearly gates than I’m used to.

They perform the checks. Ask em’ why they want in. They don’t have to, but Lume leaves something - a drawing, I think - in this wide tube that sucks up the gift and deposits it on the other side. Most people leave something. They call you friend at the gate because of it, I think. So there’s no… Awkward consequences, then or later. I think they make mistakes sometimes, though. Like when I let someone not meant to be onto my bus.

Before they go in, they ask me if I can wait a little bit for them to come back. When I ask how long, they say a few hours. I say okay. I sit there with my Trainee, and I smile and tip my hat at her, because she did pretty good. I then kind of realize I put myself in a little bit of an awkward spot. Thing is, that special little word technically clears you of obligations, least unless someone else is involved, but I still feel obliged to see them through as best I can.

But I need to make my routes. I ponder it for a bit, then I roll my shoulders. “If I wait here, will you do the real close runs? There’s some regulars that make small stops, and, well. I think maybe it’s time for you to do a… Solo shift.” It was possibly a little too early, but I wanted to see what she can do. I wanted to know that, if I went up and vanished, she’d be able to handle it.

As she drove off - she’d asked me if I was sure, and when she went she looked a whole jumble of nerves - and I sat nearby for a bit. I minded the flowers and any little discarded things. The nastier folk have a tendency to try to leave valuables ‘accidentally’ for the gate folk, specially when the greenpants of their sort are about. The kind of stuff you might step on, and bam. Bad situation.

To my surprise, I see the fellow at the gate pull up a little pamphlet, flip through, then nod to himself. He’s got a mug, he sips at it. *Number #1 Dad*. I’m not sure if it checks out grammatically or not, but it makes me smile a little. Though my little smile drops away when he speaks.

“You’re already approved, you know. You don’t have to wait outside.”

I kind of knew it already, but I still blink and stare.

“Would you… Like to come inside? You can wait in here, if you want.”

I purse my lips. Rub my hands. It’s chilly, though I can’t quite remember what season it's supposed to be. Eventually, I nod. I’m curious, and I feel vulnerable. As my bus gets far enough away, there’s this. Cord snap feeling. All the roads drop away, I panic for a bit, then after I sort myself out and decide I’m sure it’s temporary I go on through.

Nothing really… Interesting happens. I can see my own bus moving on this set of screens they got in there. It feels strange, looking at my world through a monitor instead of a map. I see some folk pass through. Nobody too remarkable. At least, not till I see… Well, I guess she goes by Lupe here? She comes in from the outside, and she walks in, and she sits down, and she kind of just stares at me for a bit like I don’t belong.

“She doesn’t bite. At least, she doesn’t bite people who tie their laces right.” The fellow watching the monitors says.

“What’s the point?” I let slip out. It just. Felt like I had to ask.

“Making sure everyone gets where they need to go. Where they *want* to, at least.” I see him pause for a second as he lifts his mug, then sigh. “You do something similar, right?”

“What do you even know about me?”

“That you’re a man with a lot of dedication who does his job to the best of his ability.” He goes quiet, for a bit. “You ever been to the end of the road?”

I almost ask him what he means, but I know. “I’m not sure. If we’re talking the literal end, yeah, a bunch o’ times. If we’re talking what’s past it…” I stare out the window for a bit. “...I don’t know. All I know is lot of people want to go there, too. And a lot of people come from there.”

“It’s not worth it. If you don’t think you’re meant to be there, if you don’t feel like you need to be there - you, not someone else telling you - then it is not where you should be.” Lupe speaks up. She’s doodlin’ something between spurts of reading.

I kinda lose my gumption for talking. It’s awkward, and it’s tense, but only for me. The other two chat away like I’m not there. I have a hard time not thinking about Lupe, she’s right there, and I think about the other one, the collar, and they’re not the same - I know it in my heart - but it’s still a reminder. And I’m following the giant, and the wolves are chasing me, telling me it’s their hunt and not mine, and I’m not listening.

Give me just a second. I need…

Okay.

Eventually, the bus slides back into view, golden eyes peeking through the trees and stopping along a road winding through the treeline. At about the same time, Lume comes out, and they go back to the bus. I take that as my cue to leave, and as I go I see the fellow with the mug watch us for a bit, sipping his coffee. I’m not sure what he’s thinkin’, but his face is screwed up in that subtle sort of way one puts it when they’re thinkin’ some sad thoughts.

“How was… Over the wall?” I ask the little feller.

“It was surprisingly boring. But I think my friend would love it. They did not look at me like I did not belong. I told them I had all the parts.”

“The what?”

“It doesn’t matter anymore.”

“...Alright then.”

As I settle into the driver seat, I ask the Trainee how it went. She says surprisingly well. I talk with her, make sure she did all the right things, that she didn’t notice anything odd and if anyone weird tried to come around. It sounds like all was smooth, and I’m proud and I’m pleased as punch.

The little guy asks me if he can go somewhere else, now. He asks me if he can go to a motel, a particular one, and then if they can go to Angelvale after. I see my Trainee tense up when they mention the second place, and I know exactly where I’d heard it before, so I give her a puzzled look. I say yeah, sure, but I lay out clearly that they have to pay and confirm each time, otherwise however far we get counts. They think that sounds swell, so I drive.

The roads all come into focus again. I picture in my head the old map getting scrawled over by the new one. The world gets stranger, but it doesn’t get smaller, and in my head I know for sure even though my map has some edges and blank spots, with some swathes of walls drawn on it in particular shapes, it’s the same map. It all cuts up, like a puzzle handed out in slices and put back together wrong.

It gets me thinkin’. Course, the next pattern distracts the heck out of me, to say the least. So I stop thinkin’. I make stops along the way, as I always do. Pick people up, put them where they go, and watch for changes in the posts. I see Copyhat a bit more than usual. Makes me wonder who puts up the posters, notices, ads and whatnot. Do they just. Poof in? Or maybe there’s someone with a real particular job.

At every stop - I stop at about twelve places, do short routes mostly - there’s a rabbit. I should rephrase. There’s a rabbit mixed with something else. They come solo or in pairs of up to about four. Now, my bus isn’t for the metropolitan areas. It’s a coach. I’ve always had to drive long distance. That means around 40 to 60 seats or so. Luggage bay, ramp. Pretty sure the hatch is non-standard.

There was only one seat not full. My Trainee refused to fill it, and instead went down into the underbelly of the bus. No one pried. But they all looked like her, if you arranged her different. Rabbit paws instead of hands, little rabbit feet. Head, torso, tail. But they all had people clothes on, and they were mixed with something roughly human and proportioned right. The ones with human faces seemed uncomfortable most of the time, had glassy eyes.

They all paid in utility items, and some of them were medical. I now own twelve med kits. One of them put in a rock, and when I whispered to myself where it could’ve come from, they just said ‘moon rock’ and sat down.

All of em’ wanted to go to Angelvale. Couldn’t help myself. I asked if there was a reason they felt comfortable telling me for the big gathering. They said ‘the moon is coming’. I supposed the full moon was soon. Then it dawned on me I wasn’t supposed to let my Trainee outside during the full moon, and I wondered how it made sense I’m pretty sure at least one full moon had passed over us without nothing crazy happening since I’d met her already.

I think I’m going to find out soon. But this one ain’t for her. I’m not planning to have to remember her because she’s gone, but because I’m proud of her. 

So when a new stop is made - you ever see a hoard of rabbits sorts go into a convenience store? All at once? - Anyway, I ask my trainee if this is the family she talked about. “Sort of.” She says, making this halfway wavey gesture. She’d put on this fancy dress she’d gotten way back in Fish - or from the mall, one of the two - and a little tiara. I’m pretty sure it’s a costume. It feels like she waited till they got off for her to get it on. She goes back down, changes back into uniform, comes back up, just sits there.

“So they’re… Good folk?”

“Yes. But not the best.” She’d done a little twirl in her dress, frowned over herself and smoothed wrinkles out of the fancy clothes. Now she was doing it with the uniform, and she made a face like it was disgusting and slimy, then she made a face like she was guilty for making the first. I couldn’t help but make a face of my own at that.

I look at Lume. Little flashlight head just starin’ out the window. They’d turned it off when the bus got crowded. They seemed to be very careful where they looked. If I paid attention, they seemed to be antsy about shadows, flickin’ their head the other way if they caught their light on one or almost had. “I think it would be nice to have such a large family.” They did a ‘blink’, light off then on. “I suppose I have one. But they aren’t as… Animated.”

The rabbits come back in, all rank and file, and their chatter is suddenly a lot louder in my ears. When I look at the convenience store, through the window, I see someone fussing with a lot of different kinds of trade items. It kind of dawns on me that I’m gonna need to refill on cardboard at the Office again already. That mundane thought settles my nerves, and I’m off to the motel.

The whole. What was the word she used? Attendancy? Herd? The whole fluffle goes on into the motel, checks in one by one, and I see the front desk looking kind of flustered and befuddled. I think around then it’s getting late. I wonder how long I’d been driving. Guess I’d been sittin’ around and herdin’ rabbits all day. Whole time, Lume was patient, didn’t seem to have much sense of fear in them, just quiet thoughtfulness. I noticed they watched the left side of the road, though, quite a bit.

That’s around when I decide to give motels a go. It’s when the front desk pulls up some really long list, and they ask me if my nickname has changed and if I need new accommodations. I look at them for a while, then I just kind of shrug. “I don’t think so.” They look at me odd. “Okay, erm. No and no.” I guess I’d checked in there before. Honestly, not a big revelation for me. I’m mostly on the bus, but I can’t have always been. I remember otherwise. I know otherwise.

I offer to get the Trainee a room, and she says sure. The little fellow looks for a coat rack, and I guess they find one. They look outside. It starts to rain lightly, and I figure maybe they had a sense for weather. Or maybe they just paid a lot of attention. My joints throb a little sometimes if the weather is about to get strange, and I guess they could’ve picked up on that. Though there was a tension in em’, now. Stillness.

“You okay?”

“I hope it does not rain long. I want to get home sooner.”

And that’s that. Everyone gets settled. Everyone gets a key. I see a man in a gray suit pass us while I walk down the hall, and he nods and smiles at me in a way that makes me frown. I pick up on the fact the hallway is really, really long. I can’t see the end of it. I pass a plaque with hotel - motel - rules on it. *No smoking (inp), no illicit substances (inp), no using the number 44 stairs (p), no unapproved liminal rewrites (depends)*, and a few other things. What stuck out to me was the little footnote saying inp stood for ill-advised not punished and p stood for punished. It also clarified *Formality in effect*.

I made a note of it, then went into my room. They gave me one close to the entrance, and thus the bus. I appreciated it. The other two went down quite a bit further.

I kind of paused in the doorway a sec, stepped out. Looked down the hall again. I wonder where all the rabbits had gone. I saw one standing outside of a doorway a long ways down, one that had proportioned but still awkward paws for hands. They fussed with the knob a bit, frowned, and then looked back down the hall at me. They mouth somethin’. But they’ve got a rabbit head still, so I don’t quite understand.

I wonder if I should check on them, but they manage and go inside. When I turn back to my own room, I see that it looks, well. Like my bus hatch. The only difference is everything personal is gone, replaced with something plain. Even the slips are there, but I’ve got no idea if they’d work. There’s the lappytop and the little boxes, but the former isn’t mine and the latter is just kind of filled with generic junk.

I get this vision in my head, almost. Like I’m standing in a before. There’s ugly wallpaper with flowers painted on it. A prim and proper little white desk, some simple lamps with boxy shades. An old telephone, the kind that you can’t carry in your hand. A vase with flowers in it, a shaggy but orderly carpet. There’s a tv on a stand, and I flick it on.

I checked two channels, both in black and white. The first one introduced - or, well, ended - itself as *Improper Crimes*, and I watched a man with a penchant for smoking puffing a cigarette. He looks at the camera, and he speaks to me, but not actually me. “And that, my friends, is why you don’t let a ghost do your writing for you. You never know when they’ll get exorcised. It might lead to an… Improper Crime.” A title card dropped, with a classical stinger.

I turned the dial. Saw a new show.

“The thing you’re about to see has not happened. Yet. These are scenes from that story. A story that will happen as soon as *these* men are ready.” It showed me an astronaut climbing along the hull of a funny looking spaceship, some men getting ready for some brave act, some fellows working at desks. Then a launch of some kind. “-This is a countdown. A missile is about to be launched. It will be the-” I forget the name of the thing, but they mentioned a fancy title. They said it meant ‘experimental moon probe’.

I saw a man talking to his son, giving him something. Kissing his wife. I think the thing he gave to the kid, the kid was supposed to return to him when he came back. His wife said something about him being back in two days, and she was real sure of it.

I saw a title card come up, but I went over and turned it back off. The telly, that is. I didn’t want to know how it ended. I felt like I already did, but I couldn’t remember if it was pleasant or not. I sat down, and I felt the weight of my bones and skin wash over me, like all the fatigue of time was catching back up to me suddenly. I looked at the door, and in my mind’s eye I saw it turn black as could be. I saw a dark, long road, with lots of people walkin’. I felt like I’d walked that road.

I didn’t know how many times.

I thought of restin’. Sittin’ or layin’ down, and thinkin’ a while. But I didn’t really have time to. “As soon as *these* men are ready. A countdown.” I heard a deep, narrator type voice, the same one I’d heard a bit ago come from the bathroom. I furrow my brows. I look down at my withered old hands, and when I get up there’s a crack in my back. I smart, curse a little as is impolite, and shuffled my way over. I’d brought my bag in with me, pulled out my hammer.

I slowly opened the door. Meant to pop it just a tad, kinda eye the floor beyond to see what kind of space was on the other side. Instead, someone grabbed the door, pulled it all the way open, and I saw something’s head beaming down at me. It was bright, and yellow, and it was coming from a flashlight that was a little too big shining right in my eye.

I stumbled back, blinked my watering peepers. When I saw again, it was black beyond the door. All I see was the head of the torch, burning bright at me. “Please don’t leave me alone.” I heard Lume’s voice, then. “You never let me-” Cut itself off. Same voice, angrier. Then, mine, sounding like it was coming off a tape.

They spliced things I’d said together. “They had my face. It didn’t take as long to find my trainee as I expected.” The light moved slightly, tilted. “I put a sign on my door.” It came a little closer, the light. But the thing holding it didn’t move into the room, yet. “But, could you do me a favor? I didn’t do good today, I think.” I heard something shuffling. “I want to be a good driver, and get people where they need to go.”

I got off my feet, though it took some effort. My legs were trembling, and they wanted to freeze. My own voice kept talkin’ at me. “You. You drive the bus.” There was a pause. “I want to see the real ocean before it goes away.” Paraphrased words I’d spoken, repeated perfectly.

I think it might’ve been trying to trade something with me. Like it had with Ori. I didn’t want to listen. So I scrambled towards the door, almost knocked over one of the lamps. I caught it on the way out, righted it, so I didn’t invite trouble. And I shut the door behind me. I had no idea if I was safe there or not. I hadn’t done anything wrong, yet, but when the world turns upside down something it’s hard to remember where you’re supposed to be.

I looked up and down the hall, listened for a bit. I didn’t hear anything strange coming from behind me. My Trainee, though, she came up to me. Rather, she was standing outside my door, off to the side a bit. I jumped when she spoke. Her good ear was propped up, turned towards the wall my room was in.

“I hear it. Their heart. It sounds… Worse, somehow.”

“I think we need to pack up and go. Right now.”

She looked at the door I’d come out of. She breathed strange for a second, then took a moment, tilted her head and screwed up her face like she was thinkin’. “Maybe we should talk to them. I want… I want to see if…” She measured her tone, her posture. Like she wasn’t sure on committing to anything just yet.

“It’s dangerous. It took one of my passengers. Only monsters take folk.” I was breathing hard myself. I didn’t want to have to run again, or move through dark tunnels. I just wanted to go to the bus. I started to, my legs carrying me to safety all natural like without my input.

I heard doors creak open behind us. This time, I looked. I couldn’t help it. I saw dozens of rabbits mixed with people, all in different clothes and with individual postures and expressions, peek out of, wander out of, tentatively step from rooms. I saw, amid that sea of fur and skin and fabric, a small light shining through the halls. It was angled down, and it cast a sort of. Light-shadow under all their feet, bounced off walls as its owner tried to look anywhere but into folk’s faces.

“I was going to come home soon. I needed to talk with the maintenance man first.” I heard their voice call.

From about half the doors, I heard a host of stolen voices. Some of them were coming from behind the rabbit folk. I saw them freeze up, others look behind, a few just move out of the door and close it behind them. “You can’t fix it. It’s broken. A witch takes your heart, it’s theirs forever.” I heard a gruff voice, one that sounded like it was trying to be not so gruff but was certain something wasn’t worth the effort.

“Make them wander for me.” I heard the voice I’d heard on the radio when the Lodge was after us, the one that’d sounded mighty different from the others. “Remember, don’t make them suffer. Kill cleanly.” I couldn’t tell if this was stolen now, too, or if there was someone else here.

I saw a rabbit disappear into a doorway. I think it was the one who’d struggled with the knob. It made a squealing sort of noise, and it was gone.

The lights flickered. I saw a storm of dark trailing down the hallway. Heard something being flicked. I didn’t know how the lighting system worked, hadn’t seen any switches, but there’d been rows of bulbs dangling from the ceiling.

I heard a lot of squealing. I also heard a lot of screaming. I saw a hoard of folk moving down the hall, towards us. Some moved carefully, others tried to hop or run in a loping sort of way, like they weren’t used to their own legs. I didn’t know what to do, so I sorted through my bag, tried to find something I could use. While I rummaged, called to my Trainee a couple things we could pull off the bus, I saw other folk being lost to the black.

More people went away than one set of arms could take at a time. I heard the shuffling of paper, a familiar sound, and I heard the clinking of tools. I swear I heard a noise like a train coming from somewhere among the madness. A little bright light was waved every way like someone running bobbing their light, trying to hold their flashlight steady in shaking hands and having a hard time.

I think that’s what got me to move. I remember who these folk were. I pushed my legs, and I started running. I tried to watch where my foot came down, but it was hard.

People pushed past me, and I almost fell. I’m not as fast as most people. But I could catch up to something that was coming towards me. As I watched folk vanish along the length of that long hallway, I saw a pattern. If someone pushed someone, and they thudded into the wall, they fell behind and their voice left the chorus. If someone stepped on something someone dropped, if someone peeked into the wrong door at the wrong time as they all opened up, they vanished.

The number of flashlights bobbing in the dark, the ones running in a pack, were many and ever growing.

Everyone who moved the right way, who didn’t so much as brush a soul too hard or stumble, outran the beast. I watched someone stumble, went to pick them up, and then someone stepped on their back to move around me. They elbowed me. A door to a dark and long tunnel opened beside me, and the offender was pulled inside.

Through a sea of white, browns, and grays I found my way to Lume. They looked down, made a noise that sounded like a choked buzz, and flicked off their light. I didn’t ask questions, I grabbed them, pulled them back by the hand. As I started going back the way I’d come, the flickering yellow and black catching up in sure jumps behind me, I saw a man in blue standing near the entrance. He was holding a wrench.

“I told you you weren’t allowed to use my tunnels unless you didn’t touch a hair on anyone’s head. Mine and yours are separate for a reason. This is my goddamn job, and I’m not going to let you take it away from me.” He started marching towards us, sure as god in his own domain. I think I saw a strange figure looking with pitying eyes somewhere behind him, at the far end of the opposite hall standing next to a stairway with the number 44 written on a plaque.

Lume rips their hand out of mine. The majority of the herd has passed us, but there’s still a few behind. I look over my shoulder. I see one get swallowed by the darkness. But as it passes over them, I hear them calling out a name. And it doesn’t sound. I don’t know, it just sounds right still.

Lume starts going the other way. I reach out on instinct, try to grab them. Something smarts, I might’ve moved too fast and pulled a muscle, and I fall to my knee as I lurch forward. My Trainee comes to pick me up, and she’s got the recorder from the bus. I hadn’t noticed she’d actually gone to grab some things. She’s got a mirror, too. I’m not sure what she’d planned to do with it. Maybe she wasn’t sure either.

It didn’t really matter.

She didn’t use the voice off her recorder, she just used hers. “Please. I need to bring them all with me. I can’t do that if you take them away.” She started stepping towards the encroaching yellow. The hallway was so long. How many rooms did this place have? Enough for everyone, it seemed. I realized I could pick out hissing, thudding, rattling and whispering all down the hall now that there wasn’t as much panic.

The thing in the dark tried to match their volume. “We gotta cook it while it’s still kickin’.  Ensures freshness, quality.” Cruelly casual. “I want to go home. Please. Just let me go home.” Pleading and desperate.

“We’re going to go somewhere very nice together. All of us. Where we’ll be taken care of. Where all the roads are straight, and everyone is always warm. Where nothing’s ever too dry or too wet, where every voice belongs to their owners, where it’s never too bright or too dark.” My Trainee drones on, sounding half herself, half someone on the moon.

I see the flickering pause. Just a second.

But it keeps going. More slowly, now, like something taking hesitant steps. With unsure footing it ambles down the hallway. The borrowed voices start to peter out, becoming overwhelmed by the real ones, and then those sounds fade away too as the people who had rooms here settled down. The people who belonged. Spaced as made the most sense, in accordance with what was left and where they most wanted to be.

I had been there before. It used to be, it’d seemed a nice place. I think, when I’d first flicked through those two channels, that it’d been a long time ago. I think this time had been the third.

I stepped after Lume, and the last of the rabbits filtered around me. The hunt must’ve been over - at least for now - since they moved calmly, more frazzled than threatened. I think they heard, saw, sensed something I hadn’t. I watched Lume go up right into the jaws of darkness. The light stopped right in front of them.

“I was going to come back. I always do. Please. Let’s just go home, okay? I think there’s someone who can help, still.”

“We can’t operate on those who didn’t give consent first. It violates the Formality. Please sign first.” The thing in the shadows had a clinical tone, all of a sudden. I saw my Trainee pause. I think I heard some of the rabbits stop shuffling away, turn, but I didn’t look at them.

The maintenance man walked by me. He slapped his wrench against his hand. I got a twist in my gut, and I moved to grab his arm. “Touch me, and I can break you, too.” Was all he said. And I was gonna do it anyways, I was gonna grab his wrist and tell him no siree, I think we need to give them a second. I realize, finally, I know both of them. I’d seen their lights before. I didn’t know them well, but I’d seen them shining.

He moved me down the length of the hall. I don’t know how he did it. It just. Happened.

“It’s fine. I don’t think it’ll hurt much.” Lume reached out. I think they grabbed the other creature’s hand.

“I am not flesh. Not anymore. It hurts. I think I’m broken.” A distorted voice came out, and I don’t think it was because of them that it sounded so strange.

“No. Sick. Like I… Like I was. And you helped me see again, so I’ll help you too. Just. Put them back. And let’s go home.” They stepped into the dark. I realized their light was off. I wasn’t sure what it meant.

“I love you. I wish it could’ve been different.” It used what might’ve been a line from some old show. I could tell by the feel of it, that far away echo old television has.

The maintenance man did not bother to wait for them to be over and done. He stepped up to them. His strides were longer than they should’ve been. He hefted his weapon of choice, gave it a test swing, then brought it down hard right on the light shining from the black. I heard the sound of shattering glass. I heard a scream that sounded like it was filtered through a broken light. I don’t think it was the voice of the thing that’d been struck.

The maintenance man used his wrench to point to a nearby sign. He trailed it from the words *liminal rewrites* down to *Formality*. He looked down, and I saw a beam shine out, aimed at his face. He just looked away. “Sorry. But you were both adults. You made your choices, and I’ll defend me and mine. I gave fair warning.” And he walked away. I think he knew I’d started fuming, since he vanished into a door. I saw a flash of a maintenance tunnel, one that I had a feeling didn’t have quite so many bulbs as the one I was used to.

The lights flicked back on. I saw something that looked like a cat made of wires, and cords, and metal with a big light for a head and a mane made from a lighting system. I think, in that last stretch, it’d been displaying it proudly. It’s strange claws had dropped a flashlight to the ground.

The rest of it’s pack looked nothing like it. They had a different sort of shape that stood on two legs, one that I suspect had long been deprived of any humanity. “Good hunt!” One said. “I miss the train.” Another spoke, voice all grainy. And they left. They retreated into doors that never should’ve gone to this place anyway, and they left.

A gnarled hand reached out and touched me on the shoulder. Another handed me a recorder. “This belongs to you, I believe.” I’d heard the voice on the radio before.

A witch made of pelts - many of which, I think I could trace back to a person, of all sorts of forms - stepped past me. I gritted my teeth and went to hit her with my hammer, one blow to the back of the head. I hated her, so goddamn much, and I won’t excuse my language. It was a familiar hate.

“You still need to get someone to their destination. You don’t break your deals on purpose, do you?” Her old, withered voice wasn’t filtered through static anymore. “Remember. You owe your friends little. But I’d dare say you should owe them at least that much.” So I stopped. My hands trembled, and I felt young again in the sort of way you do when adrenaline overrides everything else.

“Some animals will chew off their own leg to escape metal jaws. But not all of them will survive. Many of them will bleed out.” She stood in front of Lume like she was daring them to take a swing, but they simply turned their head down and shut it off. “You can keep this one. I’d hoped it’d be useful longer. I’m not cruel. I’m simply a hunter.” She moved over to a rabbit folk, looked them over.

Someone had struck them, with something cold and metallic. It’d left a bruise, but nothing more. It’d still been enough. “The dead escape their debts. But I do not forget the living who still have them.” She looked back at me. “Especially not those who cause suffering beyond necessity.”

I almost let her goad me. Said to look in the mirror. But I bit my tongue, and so did my Trainee. My Trainee didn’t even look at the witch. Just past her. “I can’t hear it anymore.” She said it a few times, till her voice trailed off.

The bog hag, the witch, the lodge master. Whatever she’d been. She just left. I think a lot of rabbits went with her. I don’t know what they’d done to make her want them in particular, if anything at all. But I think, maybe, that thing hadn’t hidden away in the shadows because it wanted to hunt.

I think it thought it was ugly. I think, some things, I think they wait till you think you’re so bad off you get desperate. The world seems. Dull, small, scary. And you look at the stars, and they seem so very bright, and you see somewhere perfect just out of reach.

If I look out my window right now, there’s a moon that’s not supposed to share the sky, small as a pinprick among the stars. They’re dull to me. But I think they’re shining very bright for some other folk. I think I need to keep them on the road, or I won’t be able to keep them from going up. I just don’t know which [one.](https://www.reddit.com/user/PattableGreeb/comments/1hspca3/outside_of_society_belong_or_be_forgotten_master/)
