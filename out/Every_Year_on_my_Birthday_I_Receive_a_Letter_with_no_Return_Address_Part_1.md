Like everyone, I get a couple letters on my birthday. When I say “letters” I mean cards, but they come in envelopes, so hey, I’ll call them letters. Pretty much all of these are from family – grandpa and grandma, some aunts and uncles, maybe one from my parents. I’m not complaining about this of course, mostly because they all come with a bit of cash in them. However, every year, I get one specific letter on my birthday that’s not like the rest.

Ever since I was seven years old, without fail, a letter shows up on my birthday. It shows up even if my birthday lands on a weekend, and it never has a return address. The letter always says pretty much the same thing, although it varies slightly every time – as an example I’ll show you the text of the one I got on my twelfth birthday: (The spelling mistakes are as written in the letter.)

“Deare R-----, (first name censored by me)

Haile and Goode day! I tryst this letter hath reached you as it left me, in Goode Health. I wishe upon thy heade the blessings of our Lord Jesus Christ and all off his Angels and Saynts. It is allway a pleasure to heare that thee antient and noble famile of Dabilstein carries on to this daey.

I tryst you shal preserve to growe into a strong and healthfool younge man, worthee off the name thou beare. Should you ever caree to learne more of thy family history, or upon to visit the family estates, thou art forever and alway welcome too the familial lands in VALKENBURG.

An visit woulde be great appreshiated – as it hath been very longe since I hath had the occasion for familial companee.

For all time,

Thy humble Servant,

Godefrido Dabilstein.”

For context, my last name is Dobbelsteyn, and every year without fail, these letters show up – no return address, no further details, and always essentially the same message as what is written above. I remember when I was seven, my dad handed me the very first of these letters. He had a smile on his face and laughed at my confusion as I read the letter and looked up at him with bewilderment. He told me that he used to receive the letters too, every year from seven until thirty, when they stopped as mysteriously as they started. Dad went on to say that his dad had also received them, also from seven until thirty.

He told me that nobody ever knew who they came from, that they always said the same thing, always showed up on your birthday, and stopped when you turned thirty. Nobody in the family was aware of anyone named “Godefrido”, so him and his dad had assumed they were just some sort of old family prank and waved it off.

Since it didn’t seem like a big deal to them, I eventually started shrugging it off too. Some years I wouldn’t open the letters, but I always kept them in a box under my bed. Oddly enough, the weird letters became so commonplace to me, that once I was older and became a big fan of true crime and mystery cases – it didn’t even cross my mind to question the letters.

As I grew up, I moved out and started attending university. I was living with my girlfriend Octavia and two other roommates when my birthday rolled around. It was the first time I had spent a birthday away from my family, and when the morning came, I stepped out into the kitchen to find Octavia making breakfast for us.

“Coffee is still hot.” She smiled, “Oh also there was a letter in the mailbox for you.”

“Awesome, thank you.” I said, pouring myself some coffee and kissing Octavia on the cheek. I sat down at the kitchen table as I scrolled through my phone.

“Not gonna open your letter?” Octavia asked.

“No… I get it every year on my birthday, it’s just from some weird relative or something.” I said waving my hand dismissively.

“What does it say?” She asked.

“Basically, just happy birthday and saying I can visit if I want.”

“Have you ever gone?”

“No, I literally have no clue who the writer is. He doesn’t even write an address or anything In the letters.” I shrugged.

“Can I?” Octavia said, pointing at the unopened letter.

“Knock yourself out.”

Octavia set down the frying pan and opened the letter, reading it over. She flipped the letter around to look at the back, but found nothing.

“Who’s Godfrey?” She asked.

“No idea.”

“You get this every year?”

“Yeah, the other ones are in that showbox under the bed.”

“You have like eight shoeboxes under the bed.” She said rolling her eyes.

“Well, they’re in one of ‘em.”

Octavia put breakfast on the table and disappeared. I heard some rummaging from the bedroom before she returned with a handful of letters. As we ate, she silently read over all the letters in the stack, looking over the envelopes, staring at them with narrowed eyes. She was a big fan of unresolved mysteries like myself, but obviously didn’t have the same familiarity with the birthday letters that I did.

“Why is it written so weirdly?” She asked.

“I don’t know, they’ve always been that way.”

“And you never thought they were weird?”

“Apparently my dad and grandpa used to get them too – I never really questioned it.”

“Your family has been getting weird birthday letters for three generations and you’ve never thought it was weird?” Octavia said with disbelief in her voice.

“Not really.” I laughed.

“Well if you’re not curious, I am. I’m going to look into this.” Octavia said, and excitedly ran off cradling all the letters in her arms.

“Happy birthday to me.” I said as I finished my breakfast and stole what Octavia hadn’t eaten from her plate.

As with all my birthdays, I spent the day on some me time. I cracked a morning beer and settled in to watch some of my favourite movies. About an hour later, Octavia re-appeared in the room, carrying her laptop. She sat across from me on the couch and excitedly began to summarize her research.

“Okay, so.” She began, “Godefrido Dabilstein was some sort of minor noble from the 1200’s in the Netherlands. Basically, the first time the Dobbelsteyns get mentioned in history. Valkenburg was the area… county… place where he was from, and the family eventually ended up owning a few castles in that area.”

“So, I’m getting letters from an ancestor of mine from the thirteenth century?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Well, no, it could just be some eccentric relative who is still keeping contact with distant relatives though.”

“Well if he wants me to visit, he’s sure doing a great job by never including an address.”

“I looked it up, Valkenburg is a pretty small town – why don’t we go? Aren’t you curious about this at all?” Octavia smiled.

“How exactly do you expect us to afford to get to the Netherlands? Student loan money?” I asked, pausing my movie.

“Well maybe we can stay with Godefrido one we find him?”

“If. If we find him.”

“Well come on, get saving and we can go in the summer and turn it into the vacation. I’ve always wanted to go to Europe.” Octavia said, standing up and smiling.

For the next few weeks, our trip to the Netherlands to find the strange letter-writer was almost all that Octavia would talk about, but I was pretty skeptical of the whole adventure. As time went on, she began to mention it less and less – and eventually, it was hardly mentioned at all.

The summer passed without our planned trip, as money just hadn’t worked out quite right. Octavia was disappointed, but I was fine with our adventure falling through. Octavia said we should try and do it for next year, and the topic was forgotten again.

As my birthday approached again, Octavia’s excitement returned, and she detailed a plan to me to stay up and catch the person who delivered the letter. I had told her that it was always delivered on my birthday regardless of weekends, so she figured it must be hand-delivered. She slept in late the day before my birthday and sat on the couch near the window drinking coffee until late in the night. It was nearly two o’clock when I walked into the living room and looked at her as she sat, watching out the window, head resting on her hands.

“Still waiting?”

“Yes.” She said, yawning.

“Come on let’s just go to bed, we’ll save the money and go to the Netherlands for a few days this summer, this is pointless.”

“But come on, if we know who is delivering the letters it might help us find Godefrido.”

“I don’t think it’ll change anything, come on, besides, it’s two AM which means it’s actually my birthday, and I don’t wanna sleep by myself.” I said, walking over and tugging on her arm.

“Fiiiiine.” She said, yawning and standing up. She went to the front entry and turned off the porch light that she had left on. The second she flicked the light switch off, both of our heads snapped towards the door – we had heard the sound of the mailbox closing. We made eye contact as confusion spread across both our faces.

I walked over to the door, flicked on the porch light, and looked out the door window. The porch was empty. I unlocked and slowly opened the door, looking around the yard for any signs of someone – while Octavia stood behind me on the tips of her toes, peering over my shoulder. I looked around one last time before I lifted open the mailbox and reached inside. I immediately found a small cloth bag inside, which had a letter tied with string to the neck.

I closed the door and turned, Octavia was reaching for the letter and bag when I pulled it away.

“Hey, who’s the birthday boy here?” I smiled.

“Hurry up!” She yelled.

I sat down on the couch in front of the coffee table and opened the letter. It read as follows:

“Dear R-----,

Haile and Goode daye! I tryst this letter hath reached you as it left me, in Goode Health. I wishe upon thy heade the blessings of our Lord Jesus Christ and all off his Angels and Saynts. It is allway a pleasure to heare that thee antient and noble famile of Dabilstein carries on to this daey.

It brightens my hearte to heare tell that thy wyfe hath appeeled upon thee to travel to thy familee seet in VALKENBURG, wich, heareing, hath gladdened indeed my hearte. I looke with greate anticipation to having you visite me at our ancestral seate.

News hath also reached mine eare that thee and thy wyfe stand as suche in pecuniary matters that it be a greate tax upon thy resources heere to travel. I knowe not what coinage the market goeth by in the newe worlde, butte I hav included gulden with my message that I hope shall be enuf to charter a voyage from your eastern coast to the shores of the lowe country.

For all time,

Thy humble Servant,

Godefrido Dabilstein.”

Me and Octavia stared at each other in bewilderment, then turned to look at the bag that had come with the letter. I opened it and poured the heavy contents out onto the table, which proved to be a hefty pile of brightly shining golden coins.

“What the fuck?” I said, lifting one of the coins and turning it around.

“This is insane! We need to go!” Octavia said, jumping up to her feet.

“What are you talking about? The letter gets delivered at 2 AM the second we aren’t looking, and knows things about conversations that only YOU and ME were there for? We’ll probably get kidnapped and killed or something the second we show up.”

“Why would your family receive letters for decades!? If they wanted to kill you or your dad or whatever they wouldn’t wait sixty years. Besides, it sounds like Godefrido is listening somehow. Why would he invest this much time into trying to kill you?”

“I don’t know, none of this makes any sense and I’m tired… and confused.”

“Let’s just go to bed and we can deal with it tomorrow.” Octavia said with a smile. I scooped the coins and letter off the coffee table and tucking both under my pillow, fell into a troubled sleep.

We woke up the next day, and I tried as much as I could to go about my birthday as normally as possible, which proved nearly impossible. Me and Octavia spent most of the day debating about what to do with the coins and the information contained in the letter.

“I say we just go.”

“This all sounds too suspicious to me.”

“How about this? I’m going. If you want to help protect me from the scary letter writer, come along. Otherwise, see you when I get back.” Octavia said, standing up with a smile.

“Come on Octavia, when? How are you gonna afford it?”

“Unlike you I’ve been saving money. And the end of the term is coming up right away. I’ll book a flight tonight and be there in three weeks.”

“Octavi-“

“I’m done arguing. I’m going.” Octavia said, walking away.

I tried bringing the issue up again, but Octavia refused to listen. Like she had said, she booked a flight that night, and wouldn’t hear any attempts to persuade her otherwise. I checked my bank account and found (as I expected) only a few hundred dollars, with most already reserved for rent. I sighed – there was no way to stop Octavia and I had no way to go with her. I didn’t want to ask her for money to fly with her and was musing over my situation when my eyes settled on the bag of coins that had arrived with the letter. I rubbed the face of one of the coins and flipped it in the air before catching it.

I woke up that Monday morning and tucked one of the gold coins into my jacket pocket. I kissed Octavia goodbye and headed off to the university. It was a short walk, and I stopped to grab a coffee on the way. I sipped it as I walked into the humanities building, winding my way up the staircases – past classrooms where lectures echoed softly from. Arriving at the fourth floor offices, I knocked on one of the doors.

“Come in!” Came a voice from behind the door. I opened it and peeked inside.

“Hi Doctor Harris, do you have a moment?” I asked.

“R-----! Sure, sure, come on, sit down what can I help you with? Got a question about translations again for me?” Doctor Harris asked, smiling and gesturing to an empty seat in front of his cluttered desk.

Harris had served as the professor for a number of my classic’s courses, and I had become known to him through some of his classical language courses. He was passionate and enthusiastic about everything he taught and was the only professor I felt I could approach with my current question.

“Actually, I was wondering if you knew someone at the university who could appraise this coin?” I asked, drawing the small gold coin from my pocket and holding it out to him.

“Let’s see here.” He said, putting on his glasses and taking the coin. “A Rhenish Gulden? Where’d you come by this?”

“Family heirloom.” I said. “Is it like… real?”

“I mean, it looks real enough. But it’s quite rare for coins this old to be in such good condition…” Harris said, looking the coin over.

“So, you think it’s a replica?”

“Hard to say… But I know someone who would know better than I would – and would actually be able to test the purity. Mind if I keep this for a few days?”

“No go ahead.” I said waving my hand.

Harris and I chatted for a few minutes casually – what classes I was taking and which ones he was teaching, before I said I had to go and made my way out of the offices.

“It’s probably some fake Chinese knock-off.” I mumbled as I left the campus grounds. “Maybe if it is I can convince Octavia this is all just some weird hoax.”

It was only three days later, on Thursday afternoon, as I was sitting in the student’s union building, when my phone rang with a number I didn’t recognize. It was a local area code however, so I answered it.

“Hello?”

“Hi, Is this Mr. R----- Dobbelsteyn?” An excited voice came from the phone.

“It is. Who’s this?”

“This is professor Hawthorne from the UofA history department – I’m calling about a coin you left with Doctor Harris earlier this week?”

“Oh yeah! The coin, what’s up with it?”

“I was actually hoping you could answer that for me.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, leaning forward in my chair.

“I’m wondering how you got your hands on a mint condition, authentic gold gulden.”

“It’s real?” I said with shock.

“It sure is – and in the best condition I’ve ever seen for one of these.”

“Wow… I… I didn’t expect that.” I stammered.

“I was actually wondering if you’d be interested in donating it to the university – I can also offer you some compensation if that would help change your mind.”

“How much compensation are we talking?”

“I can give you up to two thousand dollars for it.” Hawthorne said.

“Wow.” I started, pausing for a moment, before a slight smile spread across my face. “How much for an entire bag of them?”

There was a pause for a moment on the other end of the line. “Come see me in my office, Tory 3-18 as soon as you get a chance.”

“Alright, will do professor.”

The coins were the talk of the history department at the university. I was paid nearly 100,000 dollars for the bag of coins – more money than I had ever seen at once. I paid off all the student loans I currently had along with my credit card, and Octavia smugly said ‘I told you this is a real mystery’ when I told her about it. I reluctantly bought a plane ticket alongside Octavia, figuring if this mysterious Godefrido was going to just mail me a hundred thousand dollars then that must be worth at least a thank you in person.

The term ended, my exams were written, and me and Octavia packed for our trip to the Netherlands. I was actually getting somewhat excited at this point – still wary over the situation, but now at least more hopeful than I had been before. We arrived in Amsterdam, and decided that, with the extra money we now had, we’d spend a few days in the city and get ourselves a nice hotel.

The city was lovely, and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly before we sat down and managed to find a way to get to Valkenburg. It was a few hours on a few different trains before we finally arrived in the small town. It was a small town – less than twenty thousand residents, but it was a big tourist destination, so we found a nice hotel easily. We were unpacking in the room, and sat down on the bed, letting out a sigh from the day of travelling.

“Okay so… How do we find Godefrido?” Octavia asked.

“No clue – I figured maybe we could just ask around? It’s a decently small town, somebody must know him.” I shrugged.

“Yeah, that’s probably our best bet.” Octavia began. “Let’s split up, I’ll take the south side of the river, you get the north.”

“Deal – whoever doesn’t find anything buys dinner.” I said, standing up from the bed with a smile.

“Alright, let’s meet back up at…” Octavia said checking her watch, “eight?”

“Sounds good.”

I set out from the hotel and crossed to the north side of the town. I felt a bit odd just approaching random locals in the street, so I went into a couple businesses where the employees didn’t seem too busy and asked them if they knew a Mr. Dabilstein who lived in the area – all I received was the shaking of heads, and a few people who thought they might have a cousin with a similar name living somewhere in the area.

I gave up on the search after nearly two hours and found a quaint looking pub on the bottom floor of a brick building that looked a few centuries old. I walked inside, found the place only moderately busy, and took a seat at the bar. The young man working the bar approached me and let out a quick introduction in Dutch. I merely looked up at him and smiled as he put a menu in front of me. I looked it over quickly – couldn’t read it, and gave up. I pointed at a particularly colourful beer tap, and the young man poured me a pint.

“You speak English?” He said as he sat the beer in front of me.

“Yes, I do.” I said looking up.

“Figured. Where you from?”

“Canada.”

“Oh, Canada, very nice, eh?” He said laughing. “What brings you to Valkenburg? We’re a bit out of the way.”

“Actually, I’m looking for someone who lives around the area – do you know someone named Mr. Dabilstein?” I asked, perking up.

“Dabilstein… Doesn’t sound familiar. Though I know someone who might know. Old fella’, must be a millennium old at this point, knows everything about the local area.”

“That would be great, where do I find him?”

“He’s a regular here – wait around long enough he’ll probably show up.”

“Alright, can do.” I said and turned my attention to my beer.

The bartender – who’s name was Ben, and I chatted for the next hour about ourselves. What life was like in the two different countries, hobbies, all the standard bar chat. When the hour had elapsed, the door of the pub opened and an old man, who did indeed look ancient but who still had energy in his step, walked in. He came to the bar and sat down. He wore a large white beard and a sweater that seemed too thick for the summer heat.

“You must be the young man looking for ol’ Dabilstein?” The old man said, ordering a beer and greeting Ben. The old man responded in what sounded like the accent of the American Midwest, which made me curious.

“That’s me, I’m R-----, nice to meet you.” I said, shaking the man’s hand.

“Rick, pleasure.” He said, taking a deep drink from his pint. “Let me guess, you’re getting the letters on your birthday?”

“How’d you know?” I said, being taken aback with the shock of someone else knowing about the letters.

“Because I used to get em’ too when I was young.” Rick smiled.

“You did? I thought it was just my family.”

“So did I when I was your age. Every year, seven until twenty-one, just like my father and his father before him.”

“Oh my god… well… what do you know about them? Wait! Actually, do you mind if I call my girlfriend? We split up trying to find out about the letters, she’ll want to hear this.” I asked, fumbling for my phone in my pocket.

“Have at ‘er.” Rick said.

I called Octavia who gasped excitedly and asked for the name and address of where I was. I provided it and she hung up saying she’d be right there. I put the phone back down and turned my attention back to Rick, who smiled at me.

“She sounds full of fire that one.”

“She is.” I smiled slightly, “So, are you American? How’d you end up here of all places?”

“I had been getting the birthday letters for a few years at that point.” Rick started with a sigh. “I enlisted when I was sixteen – they said I was big enough to pass for an eighteen-year-old. I got assigned to the 30th Infantry Division. When we rolled from Normandy and into the Netherlands, we were the unit that cleared the Nazis out of Valkenburg. Everyone from the town came out that day – flowers, fresh bread, the girls all smiling and cheering. Well, the letters had been telling me for years to come to Valkenburg, and the town was a beautiful little place. Not to mention I happened to fall in with a young girl from the town who I took a fancy to. I wrote her letters until they made to ship me home in forty-six. I managed to get off going back to the states and married her right here in town. Lived here ever since.”

“Wait, you fought in the second world war?” I asked.

“That I did.” Rick nodded.

“Wouldn’t that make you like…” I started, trying to do the math in my head.

“I turned ninety-nine this past fall.” Rick smiled.

“Wow.”

“Tell me about it.” Rick said, sipping his beer.

It was right after this that Octavia came flying through the door of the bar, out of breath and scanning the barroom. Her eyes settled on me and she smiled, striding over to me and sitting down on my right.

“Hi there, I’m Octavia.” She said, extending her arm across me to shake Rick’s hand.

“Rick, pleasure.”

“So, you know about the letters?” Octavia said breathlessly. She turned briefly to tell Ben she would take some water before her attention snapped back to Rick.

“Aye.” Rick nodded. “So, much like you, I started getting the letters when I was seven, which my father told me always happened to all the first-born sons of the family. It had stretched back for generations, the odd letters, always from Godefrido, and always inviting the recipient to come visit.”

“So, are you a Dobbelsteyn too?” I asked.

“Spelled a little different but yes. From what I’ve learned over the years – this only happens to our family. Dobbelstein, Dobbelsteijn, Dobbelsteyn, van Dobbelsteyn, von Dobbelstein, doesn’t matter the exact spelling if they’re all linked back eventually to Godefrido Dabilstein.” Rick said.

“So… the writer is just someone who wants distant family members to move to this town?” Octavia asked, puzzled.

“Could be… Though I’m afraid the mystery runs a bit deeper than that.” Rick spoke. “You see – once I had put the pieces together, I was bit too past my soldiering days – plus I had a wife and kids to take care of. I couldn’t go diving around into mysteries anymore.”

“So, what is it, what did you find out?” I asked, attention completed wrapped around Rick’s words.

“A few miles out of town, there’s an old castle – the old ruins of a castle more like, the castle that Godefrido Dabilstein built all the way back in the thirteenth century. Folks around here say the castle is cursed, to the extent that nobody so much as goes near it these days. They say that some Dutch resistance fighters holed up in the castle during the war, and when the Nazis brought up their howitzers to level the castle, all the shells blew up in their faces, so they gave up. The resistance fighters? Nobody ever saw ‘em again. They’ve tried to restore it, to build something around it, but every time, so much with the construction crew goes wrong that they give up. Ain’t nobody touched the land in near a century now, and the land is just some sort of historical zone that they don’t do anything with.”

“So Godefrido lives in the castle?” Octavia asked.

“You ever had the content of the letters change on you, R-----?” Rick asked, ignoring Octavia’s question.

“Yeah, just this year. We had kinda planned on coming, but I didn’t have the money for it. The letter came with a bag of old gold coins and told me to come visit.”

“The letters changed for me too once I lived in Valkenburg.” Rick started. “They kept telling me to come visit the castle.”

“Did you go!? What was in there!?” Octavia asked, almost shouting.

“The wife didn’t want me chasing ghost stories into old, cursed castles.” Rick shrugged. “I doubt you’ll have that problem though.” He continued, gesturing to me.

“Well come on, let’s go!” Octavia said. Rick was stone faced.

“I’ll admit, I am curious to see what’s inside there.” Rick said contemplatively.

“Well, let’s all go.” Octavia said, waving her hand to gesture to the three of us.

“I suppose I don’t have a wife holding me back anymore… Besides, the kids are all well settled on their own…” Rick mused.

“Perfect, come on, we can all make the trip!” Octavia beamed.

“You sure this is a good idea?” I asked.

“What, do you think ghosts and curses are real?” She said mockingly.

“Well, no…” I started.

“Perfect, then it’s settled. Why don’t we go tomorrow? The weather is supposed to be good.”

Ben, who had been listening to us piecemeal from behind the bar the whole time, piped up. “Sorry, I couldn’t help overhear – you guys are going to the cursed castle?”

“Yes sir.” Octavia replied.

“Want some extra hands? Me and my girlfriend have always joked about spending a night in the castle.” Ben said.

“Sure! The more the merrier.” Octavia said.

Ben was thrilled, Rick seemed hesitant but on board, I was tentatively excited, and Octavia was over the moon with anticipation. We all agreed to meet at Rick’s house the next day for lunch before setting off to the castle, which wasn’t a long drive from town. Octavia and I returned to the hotel, where, reminding her of our bet, I had her pay for dinner in the hotel restaurant.

Octavia slept like the next day was Christmas, and I slept as though the next day would bring some sort of medical procedure. We woke up late, and had coffee followed by a lovely walk along the riverfront. When the agreed-upon lunch time rolled around, we headed for Rick’s house and arrived to find Ben and his girlfriend arriving at the same moment. We introduced ourselves to his girlfriend – Maria, and the four of us were let inside by a smiling Rick. He sat us all down around the large table in his dining room, and brought out coffee, wine, and sandwiches, along with a charcuterie board he had prepared. His dining room was decorated with war memorabilia, the most prominent of which was his old military uniform in a display case. As we ate, Rick regaled us with stories of his time in the war, along with stories about his wife who had died some two decades prior.

When the time came to depart, we piled into Ricks car and made a short trip into the countryside. We pulled off the winding countryside road onto a barely travelled wagon path and plunged into a forest. Sun was breaking through the canopy and turning the floors of the forest a rich green, as we bumped and jostled our way through the woods. We emerged into a large clearing, that was slowly being reclaimed by the forest, and rearing up ahead of us on a small rise were the ruins of Godefrido’s castle.

Two stone towers that must have been towering and impressive in their day had largely collapsed into sad remnants of past times, and crumbling outbuildings encircled by the corpse of a curtain wall surrounded the keep to which the two towers were joined. The occupants of the car let out a chorus of sounds that acknowledged the awe which they felt, and Rick pulled the car to a stop in the shadow of the curtain wall.
