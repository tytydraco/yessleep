Part 1/3

To say I’ve lived a long life would be an understatement. I’ve lived many lifetimes. I’ve loved many families. I’ve seen empires rise and fall like the sun. I’ve seen humanity’s barbarism and savagery morph from swords and spears to bullets and bombs. In my youth I enjoyed war. I enjoyed the blood and glory. Or at least the idea of it. But when you’ve lived a life as I have. When your years are as endless as mine. When you see so many lives lost. You realize war is a tragic waste of short lives. Especially when men kill other men. 

Historians say that the 9th Roman legion vanished without a trace. With the last known sign of them being an inscription on a legionary base at Nijmegen in the Netherlands, which dates to around 120 AD. From there Historians don’t know if the legion was destroyed in one of several Roman wars or if it was destroyed in a rebellion. Most originally theorized the 9th fell in Britain. Some still believe this theory. But it’s just a theory nonetheless. The 9th disappeared from Roman texts in the early second century. But it’s one thing to theorize about history. It’s another to live it. 

I lied about my age to join the legions. The requirement was for you to be at least 17. I was 15. A child by todays standards. Yet I yearned for the heat of battle and the taste of glory. It was a fantasy I carried all my life. I didn’t grow up in a noble house. I didn’t have a rich family name. I didn’t have connections with the Emperor or the Senate. I was just me. A Roman citizen called Marcus. The training was hard. It wasn’t the worst four months of my life though.  After training I was assigned to the 9th despite training with the 11th. At the time the 9th was stationed about a hundred miles west of Jerusalem. 

When I arrived I was greeted by a tall man of broad build. He was maybe twenty years my senior. He was to be the Centurion of my Century. I called him Maxus. He very quickly made it known that he was aware of my age. 

“Lied about your age, did you?” he said with a smirk as I approached him. His voice was booming.

“I uhh..” I stammered as my heart skipped a beat. 

“I could have you flogged for that?” he asked with a raised bushy brow. 

I honestly didn’t know what to say. I didn’t expect to be outed so very quickly. 

“How old are you? Twelve? Thirteen?” 

“Uhh.. Fifteen!” I said sheepishly. 

“Fifteen?!? Are you sure?” 

I nodded as Maxus looked me up and down. We stood just outside the city of tents that made up the 9ths camp. 

“Come then! Let us meet the Primus Pilus!” 

The Primus Pilus, for those of you who don’t know, is the senior centurion in a Roman legion. They are the fourth in command in a legion behind the Prefect, the Broad Band Tribune, and the Legate or Legion Commander.  Now the 9th legion at this particular time was different from most if not all legions that came before it. Yes most legion commanders were typically politicians or senators, one could even be a governor of a province. The 9th’s commander at this point in time is lost to history. In fact, the 9th was also kept off the record at this point in time as well. Our legion commander was called Quintus. Commander Quintus was…. Different. 

Maxus led me to the Primus Pilus tent while the man was meeting with the commander. They were both looking down at a map of the nearby area. Our Primus Pilus, a bald man called Luke, was pointing to an area. 

“Locals said they fled into this mountain pass. A days March for most armies. A few hours for us.” He said. 

Quintus stroked his chin. One could tell by looking at him that he was an Intelligent man. His armor was darker then most Legion commanders. Almost like it was made from a different metal all together. He also didn’t wear the typical red that was associated with the Roman army. He’d traded it in for black.

“And how many did the locals say?” 

“Three hellhounds!” 

“Only three? I thought there’d be more!” 

“They’re hellhounds, Commander! They’re still dangerous to the uninitiated!” Luke reminded him. 

Quintus thought for a second before his eyes rested on Maxus and I. 

“Yes, Centurion?” he asked. 

“We’ve got ourself some new blood Commander.” 

“Ah! I see.. Has he been…… Initiated yet?” 

Maxus turned and glanced at me before looking back at the commander. 

“He only just arrived!” 

Luke smirked at him as straightened up. 
“He looks young! Did he lie about his age?” 

“Yes… Yes he did.” Maxus said. 

“Heh! Typical! Let me ask you something boy! Why did you wish to join the legions? Do you consider yourself a patriot?” Luke asked. 

“I uhh.. I don’t have anything to my name. No family. No house. No titles or land.”

“So you want to make a name for yourself? Be remembered?” Quintus asked. 

“Yes, Commander.” 

Quintus took a deep breath. 

“I’m sorry kid, you’ll find none of that here!” Luke said. 

I glanced at him in confusion. 

“You think I won’t be a good soldier?” I asked.

“You wouldn’t be here if we thought you wouldn’t. What do you know of this legion?” Asked Quintus. 

“It’s a legion? Like any other?” 

“Hmm.” Quintus grunted before drawing in a deep breath. 

“Like any other..” Luke chuckled. 

“If you’re worried about my age. I can prove myself! I’m ready!” I said almost all too eagerly. Very much misreading the situation. 

“Maxus.. Take.. What was your name?” 

“Marcus?” 

“Take Marcus on a scouting mission to the mountains. If he survives, see that he’s…. Initiated properly.” Quintus said with a smile. 

“Yes, Commander.” Marcus replied. His massive hand fell on my shoulder as he pulled me out of the tent. 

“What did he mean by initiated properly?” I asked. 

Maxus didn’t reply. He just continued dragging me along. He brought me to a tent where we were greeted by two other men. One a Thracian called Crixus. The other a Greek who went by Solaris. 

“You two, pack your things! We’re moving out!” Maxus commanded. 

The two of them eyed me. 

“Yes! He’s coming with us!” Maxus barked as if he was reading their minds. 

I was very confused. I was also very tired after having such a long march. I glanced at my Centurion. 

“What’s wrong soldier? Having second thoughts?” 

“No!” I said abruptly.

Maxus smiled widely. 

“Very well then! Let’s go hunting!” 

I admittedly didn’t think much of Quintus mentioning of the hellhounds. Personally I guess I’d thought they’d be rebels or something similar. Maybe I was just tired. Maxus led the three of us to a mountain pass. It was dusk when we arrived. The sun was starting to set at our backs. I was exhausted from the journey. I wasn’t sure how the other three men weren’t. Maxus had asked me several times if they needed to slow down. But I was young. I had everything to prove. 

The pass itself was narrow. One might could get a row of five to six men in between the jagged rocks on either side. Luckily there were only four of us. I can remember stopping just outside of it. The stench of rot and blood seemed to inch its way up my nose. Solaris stopped next to me. 

“Definitely hellhounds.. Their den is probably close by.” he said as he pressed forward. 

I glanced over at Maxus. My grip on my pilum tightened. 

“Den?” I asked. Only now realizing that I should have asked more questions to begin with. I noticed Solaris and Crixus moving ahead of us.

“I thought this was just a scouting mission?” I said.

“Keep your shield up boy!” Maxus replied as he motioned me to come with him. 

I did as commanded. My leg muscles ached. As did the rest of me. We entered the pass cautiously. Crixus and Solaris were at the front. Both of them had their shields up and their swords out. We moved slowly.. Silently.. Our eyes peeled and our weapons ready. The air seemed thick and musty. All was quiet. That was when we came round a bend. I can remember because the Sun had finished going down. I wasn’t sure why, but I could feel my heart beat accelerating. 

“Take a breath boy!” Maxus replied in a hushed tone. Almost like he could hear it. 

It was then that we heard the shuffle of some rocks. I turned quickly. My spear ready. The movement was coming from a ledge that wasn’t twenty feet above me. It was hard to see. Especially in the dark. I readied go launch my pilum at it. But Maxus arm grabbed my shoulder. 

“Don’t!” He whispered right as a massive vulture came flapping off the ledge and into the sky. 

I felt my body go from tense to relaxed. I exhaled. But the moment I did. A long howl sounded off. It was like that of a wolf but deeper. More pronounced. It also sounded extraordinarily close. It felt like my heart jumped into my throat. 

Solaris and Crixus moved forward around the bend, leaving my line of sight. 

“Stay calm boy!” Maxus commanded in a hushed tone.

“I am calm!” I lied. 

We rounded the bend to find Crixus and Solaris standing at the base of a cave. The entrance was gaping. It stood almost twenty feet tall. It was already dark on the mountain. The inside of the cave was nothing but a void. We were surrounded on two sides by even more ledges. I kept my eyes on them almost instinctively. 

As we approached the cave I could feel my stomach start to churn as the smell became overwhelming. 

“I think we found the den!” Solaris said. 

“Do we go inside?” I asked. 

“A hellhound den? Are you daft?” Asked Crixus.

“Leave him alone.” Maxus said as he knelt down ahead of us. He was looking at something down in the dirt. Something I recognized as a wolf print. Only this one was massive. So massive in fact, that I could stick my entire hand inside of it. 

“What have I gotten myself into?” I muttered to myself. 

That was when we heard the bark. Maxus shot up. 
“Form a shield wall! Have your pilum ready!” 

Solaris and Crixus sheathed their swords and pulled their spears from their backs. That was when something inside the black void moved. Three sets of glowing red orbs appeared. It took me all of three seconds to figure out what they were. Eyeballs. Blazing red and filled with malicious hatred. They stood maybe six feet off the ground. Every bone in my body screamed for me to run. But I didn’t. I stood my ground.

“Hold your ground!” Maxus commanded before turning to me.

“Whatever happens boy.. Don’t run!” 

I swallowed hard.

That was when the red eyes in the center began to move closer. The beast walked to the mouth of the cave. I don’t remember if I pissed myself or not. I certainly may have. The beast was a black wolf. A black wolf that was larger than a full sized horse. It’s red eyes were focused on me. It snarled showing its massive white teeth. 

“Solaris..” Maxus said. 

The man launched his pilum at the beast. The throw was hard. His spear moved faster than any I’d ever seen. Maybe even faster then a missile from a ballista. It hit the wolf in the shoulder. The creature yelped as it fell. I blinked a few times. Trying to comprehend what I’d just seen. But there wasn’t any time as the other two wolves were suddenly growling and sprinting out direction. 

I was at the outer edge of the shield wall. The second beast came forth from the cave. 

“Crixus!” Maxus commanded. 

Crixus launched his spear. But the Wolf had only just watched it’s brother fall. It ducked under the spear and charged forward. Ramming into our shield wall hard. I caught most of the force and was rocked off my feet and onto the the ground. I lost my shield. The beast battled with the other three men as I tried to regain my bearings. Only I found the third wolf standing over me. It’s glowing red eyes seemed to bore into my soul. 

“Oh… Fuck!” Was all I managed to get out before its jaws came down. 

I managed to get my spear up but barely. It’s jaws ripped it from my hands before it snapped the wooden handle of the pilum in two. I struggled to my feet as I yanked my gladius from its sheath. The beast growled at me and charged. I didn’t have time to run. I stepped out of the way. Barely dodging it’s massive jaws. I slashed at its neck several times. But my sword only seemed to glance off. The wolf replied to this with a swipe of its paw that sent me tumbling backwards toward the mouth of the cave. I just happened to land right next to the first wolf’s corpse. The beast bared it’s teeth at me. I swallowed hard as I realized I dropped my sword. My hands reaching out for anything the could. Only resting as they found Solaris’s pilum. I managed to yank it out just as the hellhound charged me again. Holding it out point first. There was a loud squelch that was followed by a yelp. The next thing I knew the beast was limp on top of me. A warm liquid was running down my hands and chest. I’d killed the beast. But I wasn’t strong enough to get it off of me. 

It took a few seconds before the beast was moved. Maxus helped me to my feet. A massive smile across his face. 

“By the gods he survived!” 

I could see Solaris and Crixus standing over the corpse of the wolf that’d charged them. That’s when I realized that Maxus had moved the wolf by himself. I wanted to ask questions. What we’re those things? How did he do that? What in Neptune’s creamy ballsack had I gotten myself into? But I was also tired and quite frankly, thankful to be alive.

“And you killed the fucker too! Not bad for an uninitiated man like yourself!” 

I chuckled under my breath. I was honestly just happy he didn’t call me boy again. 

There was little fanfare when we made it back to camp. We’d camped out for the night and left in the morning. We reached camp in the afternoon. Admittedly, my aching body slowed the group down. Maxus took me into a tent near the center of camp where I found Quintus waiting for us. 

“The boy proves himself a man.” He said with a smile. 

My body was still in pain. Maxus stood next to me. 

I’d never seen a tent set up the way Quintus had arranged this one. It was almost empty. Aside from a large white marble box in the center. One that was filled with a red substance that I couldn’t identify. I honestly thought it wine at first. 

Quintus could tell that I was sore. He exhaled slowly. 

“What is that?” I asked as I looked at the marble box. 

“That?” He asked.

“That is what’s going to make all of that muscle aching go away.” 

“So it’s wine?” I asked

Quintus chuckled. 

“You’ll understand more after your initiation.” 

“Fighting those wolves wasn’t my initiation?” I asked. 

“No! That was… A test.. And you passed. You didn’t run away.” Maxus said from behind me. 

“Well then what’s my initiation going to be?” 

Quintus took a deep almost saddened breath before giving me a soft smile. 

“Sorry kid! You won’t understand if I explain it.”

Then I felt the sharp pain in my back as the air was driven out of my lungs. I tried to gasp but it didn’t work. It was only then that I noticed the blade sticking out from my chest. I tried to speak. To ask why. But again, nothing came out. My eyes glanced upward at Quintus. Who had a solemn look in his eyes. 

“It’s okay, Marcus.” Maxus said into my ear as he yanked his sword from my back. 

Everything faded to black after that. I’d say there’s an eerie calmness in death. But honestly, my soul didn’t leave my body. I didn’t see heaven, hell, Tartarus, or Elysium. Instead I woke up submerged in something. Something that had the consistency of blood. I tried to open my eyes but the liquid stung them. I sat up fast, erupting from the surface and trying to take a breath. But the liquid had filled my lungs. Instead I let out a series of overly dramatic coughs as red liquid gushed from my mouth and onto the tent floor. My eyes adjusted and I found myself staring at the white marble on the side of the box. 

“He’s back.” A voice from beside me said. 

I glanced over to find Quintus standing next to me. I was a bit delirious. Everything in my body hurt and the sounds pelting my ears were obnoxious and nauseating. I could hear the whole camp. From the flies buzzing in the treeline to a centurion masturbating two tents down. My hands shot to my ears. But they did little to muffle the noise. 

“Easy! Easy! Let yourself settle!” Maxus said as he helped me to my feet. 

I turned to him with wide eyes. There he was. The man who’d stabbed me in the back. I shoved him hard. But he barely moved an inch. Instead I fell backward. Falling out of the box and onto the ground beneath me. 

“Y-you stabbed me!!” I groaned. 

Maxus turned to Quintus and then back to me. 

“I did. And I’m sorry I had to do that. But that’s how the initiation works.”

“I don’t give a damn about your initiation! You killed me! I—“

I stopped and looked down at my naked chest. There was a scar where the blade had erupted from it. Not a cut, not a gash, a full on, already healed, scar. 

“H-how?” I murmured. 

“It’s called the Omega potion..” Quintus stated. 

“The omega potion?”

“Yes. Tell me something Marcus… Do you know why the 9th hasn’t been on any records in the last twenty years?” Quintus asked.

“It hasn’t?” 

“No.. Because we don’t exist to fight Rome’s endless wars. Not anymore. As far as most are concerned the 9th was lost in Britannia.”

“But how was I assigned here then?” I asked. 

Quintus sighed as Maxus again helped me to my feet. 

“There are few who know of our existence. They pick the recruits. Most don’t have any friends or family. No one to miss them or look for them when they’re gone. No attachments. It makes things easier. Especially with the effects of the omega potion.”

“Effects?” 

“You may have noticed your chest has healed. You can hear Luke touching himself in his tent.” Quintus stated. 

“Among other things.” Maxus said sarcastically. 

“It also makes you fast, strong, almost godly. You won’t age past twenty-five.” 

I looked over at Maxus. The older man smirked at me. 

“I’ve was already this beautiful when I got it!” he said. 

I turned back to Quintus. Who was still watching me. 

“So I can’t die?” I asked.

“You absolutely can die! There’s a good chance you will! I reformed the 9th to protect the world from the dangers lurking in the shadows. To conquer humanities enemies.” 

“Dangers? You mean there’s more then just hellhounds out there?” I asked. 

“Hellhounds, rogue gods, demons, all sorts of beasts. They’re all out there. And you’re gonna have to face them. Speaking of.. Maxus. Show him to his new arsenal.” He said. 


Maxus did as he was told. He led me to my tent. I was to be sharing one with Solaris, Crixus, and seven other soldiers. All of which greeted me warmly. Crixus was our decanus. The one in charge of the ten of us. There Maxus gave me my new weapons. A new shield, gladius, and Pilum. Only they felt lighter then the ones I’d had. I wasn’t sure if it was because I was stronger or if they were made of something else. I guess it showed on my face. 

“They’re made from heavenly steel as will your armor. The weapons can be powered by your soul’s energy.” Crixus said. 

“My souls energy?”

Crixus held up the sword. The blade was black but the edges started glowing a neon blue color. I remember being slightly mesmerized by it and reaching out to touch the light. Crixus pulled the sword back.

“Ah! That will burn the fuck out of you!” 

I chuckled under my breath. 

“My apologies.” I said. 

Crixus only exhaled.
