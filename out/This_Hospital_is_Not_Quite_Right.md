My older brother Luke was just recently in a car accident. This poor old lady hit him as he went through a green light. Thankfully, she had insurance. He was in a different part of town than usual, so he ended up in the closest hospital, not the usual one we go to. I’d never been there before, never even heard of it. But as soon as I got the call, I was on my way.

“Luke, oh thank God you're okay!" I said.

“Yeah, man, banged me up pretty bad though. Fuckin' old lady." He laughed.

“What were you doing out here anyways?" He got sheepish.

“Well, my car's totaled." He said with a frown. I didn't push him any further on the subject of his whereabouts, though I was curious.

“I’d uh give you a hug but..." I said, gesturing to his cast.

“Heh, yeah. It’s cool. Thanks for coming."

“Of course. Well, other than this uh, how you been?"

“Oh, you know."

“Yeah. Well, let me know if you need anything. I’m really glad you're okay."

“Sure thing. Appreciate you stopping by."

“When are they letting you out?"

“Should be a couple of days. I gotta get surgery for my hip." I winced.

“Oh man, I’m sorry. I’ll stay the night with ya."

“Oh, are you sure? I mean you don't have to do that for me."

“Hey, come on, it's a perfect excuse to get out of work." He chuckled.

“Yeah, you're right. Well, have a seat then."

We sat around and chatted for hours until we drifted into sleep. I woke up to sunlight pouring through the cracked blinds of the window. My brother was sound asleep. I pulled out my phone to check the time. 8 am. Damn, I never get up this early. I guess sleeping in a chair will do that.

Not long after, my brother woke up.

“Hey there, he is. I’m gonna go check and see if I can find some breakfast somewhere. What do you want?"

“Eh, surprise me."

“Really? Come on, you don't want your usual?"

“Yeah, fine. Don’t forget the hot sauce."

“Copy that." I waltzed out of that door. Despite the situation, it really was great to see my brother again. Life circumstances had drifted us apart, but we were still close. It was good to have him back, for however brief it might have been.

The fluorescent lights flickered above me as I strolled the halls. It was pretty quiet until I turned the corner. I heard a scream. What the hell? I nearly jumped out of my skin. Did I just hear that? It wasn't an ordinary scream either, not like someone had just been a little frightened. No, that was a scream of desperation and pure terror. It was too early for this shit.

I stood there, breathing heavily. Having just rounded the corner, I saw a door cracked open. Hardly any light seeped out of the room. I decided it best not to investigate any further. I promptly turned around and headed back to my brother's room. I was nearly out of breath from my sprint back when I arrived. I popped open the door.

“Dude, did you hear that scream? It totally scared..." My words trailed. I opened my mouth to speak, but no words could come out. The well that was my mouth had dried up. With unblinking eyes, I stared at what lay before me.

In the hospital bed. His skin was the color of hot coals, like he'd just received a horrific sunburn across his entire body. Blood seeped from his bandages and casts. His eyes were a bright, blinding blue, before they were brown. He opened his mouth. Oh God. it twisted and contorted for what felt like a century. A giant yellow tendril shot out of his mouth. It was slimy, like a massive slug. His body writhed violently in the bed, then he shot up and turned towards me.

I sprinted out of the room faster than I ever had before, slamming that door shut behind me. A loud crash came from inside the room, followed by a thump at the door. It almost knocked me off my feet. My peripheral vision saved me. Just out of the corner of my eye, I spotted something growing closer. 

It was a nurse in a similar state to my brother. Her skin resembled that of a chameleon in its natural state. Where her hands were, long black claws that must have been five feet in length dragged along the floor. She began to charge towards me. Frantic, I booked it down the hallway, turning corners so fast I almost slipped and fell. She didn't let up, keeping her breakneck speed the whole time she chased me down the halls.

I had to find a way out and fast. Who knew what would happen if she caught me? The elevator.

I hopped in and pressed that button at a million miles an hour. The elevator seemed to take its time, as if it were mocking me. She rounded the corner, skidding across the floor. Then, she charged towards me faster than ever. The sound of her footsteps rattled in my brain. My whole body shook as the door began to close. Come on. Almost there. 

As the door shut, she changed course, and I heard a door crash open. Oh God. The stairs! The elevator ride felt like a lifetime. I breathed so heavily I thought I would pass out. Waiting anxiously for that door to open, I hoped she hadn't made it downstairs yet. If she was there, I was as good as dead.

Finally, the door opened. I turned my head every which way and dashed out of the elevator. A loud noise came from a few feet away. The exit was in sight. She had made it down the stairs, and she brought a friend. My brother. I kept glancing over my shoulder to gage how close they were.

I nearly ran into the automatic door and then zoomed out into the parking lot. Much to my surprise, they didn't follow me out. Or at least I didn't hear them. When I was far enough away, I turned around once more. I didn't see them at all.

I found my car in the parking lot and collapsed into the driver's seat. That’s when my phone rang in my pocket. A familiar number. My brother. Hesitantly, I picked it up.

“Hey, I heard you were in a car accident. Are you okay?" He said.

“What? Oh God, something weird was going on. "Who told you that?" I asked.

“I got a call from the hospital." I stared out of the windshield of my car in disbelief. Something horrible was going on.
