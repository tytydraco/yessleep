Three days ago I woke up from the screams. My daughters and wife were horrified of finding me in bed. They had no idea who I was or why I was in that bed. I thought it was a prank, we did pranks on each other all the time, so I looked up at the picture from our wedding and I was shocked to see there was someone else there. Same photo, same suit, but it wasn't me.  I recognized the person in that photo from somewhere but I couldn't put it together. The screaming brought my attention back to my family. They were horrified, against the corner of the room. I could see the fear in their eyes. My wife... my kids. I'd never seen them like that. They were crying, begging me to leave.

The cops showed up... someone had called them from the hearing the screams. They came up and I heard my wife tell the cops she had no idea who I was or what I was doing there... that I had just "showed up" they woke up and found me there. Cops took me and shoved me in jail. I had no ID so I called my parents... the only house phone number I still know. I was hoping it was all a bad dream, honestly I was hoping I was losing my mind and had hallucinated the entire thing, but when my dad answered the phone and asked who was calling, he had no idea who I was... I could hear my mom asking *who*'s *calling?* like I was a telemarketer trying to sell a condo.

I couldn't sleep all night thinking of my family. Trying to figure out what had happened. I missed them so much and it hurt so deeply to see them so frightened. I had to find a way of getting them back, making everything right and back to normal. I fell asleep hoping I'd wake up from a nightmare.

The cops let me go the following day since no one pressed charges. They put me out on the street. I had no phone, no wallet... I had nothing. Nowhere to go. I didn't want to go home. I couldn't stand the thought of causing my kids and wife more pain, I couldn't shake their horrified little faces from my head. My parents lived about an hour's walk from where I was so I decided to try that. My childhood home, the school I went to all my life. Surely I would find something that could make sense. Maybe it was all a nightmare... I reached the street where my parents live. Saw the neighbors I've known my entire life and waved at them but they didn't wave back. They hurried inside their house.

I was dreading what came next. I rang the doorbell to my parent's house and saw my mom open the door. Honestly I've never been happier to see her. I felt like everything was going to be alright. She was smiling, but I quickly learned it was a polite smile, the one she uses in the supermarket, and when she's trying to get rid of a solicitor. She asked "how can I help you sir?" I was frozen. I was trying to make sense of everything trying to keep myself together. I heard my dad in the background, asking who was at the door and I could see how uncomfortable my mom was getting with me just standing there saying nothing. "Sir?" I just left, I walked away from my childhood home, from that street I grew up in.

It was Sunday evening as I walked around the city and saw families eating together, enjoying their weekend. I was trying to piece together what had happened to me. Friday night, my wife and I had gone to a restaurant downtown, close to my office. I had had meeting all day and got to our reservation late. My wife was already at the table. I remember a man was talking to her, chatting her up. We joked about how disappointed that man was at seeing us together, annoyed I'd say. He shook my hand and left but he had a deep, unsettling look.

We had a great dinner, ate wonderful food, laughed. I remember we got pretty drunk from the wine we ordered and ended up taking a cab. We went to bed and I woke up to my family screaming on Saturday morning. That's the night my life changed. Maybe I could go to that restaurant, see if I could piece together my life from that point. When I go there, I realized I was pretty disheveled. The place was nice so I'd never make it past the door looking like I'd been on the street for a couple of days. I remembered I had an extra suit at work. I always kept a spare one in case I needed an emergency change. The problem was I had no idea if I would be able to go in. I'd go in on Sundays only if I was heading out for a trip or coming back from one and had to put something in the safe or do my expenses. But I knew the code so as long as I could make it past the guard, I'd be able to make it inside my office.

I waited for the guard to make his round and head back to the front desk. I approached the side door and put the code. The door opened up and I headed straight for the elevator. As I was waiting for the door to open, I could hear the security guard make his round. The door opened just in time for me to squeeze in before he came around the corner. I went up to my floor, the office was empty, as it was on Sundays. I went straight to my office, punched the code and went inside. My suit was there... It was the first good thing to happen in these couple of days. There was a couple hundred dollars from the last business trip still in a envelope in my desk.

I went back to the restaurant, waited for my table at the bar. I was trying to figure out my next step when I saw someone that immediately sent a shiver up my spine. I head a little bell ring. At first I didn't know why I felt that chill through my bones when I heard it, but then I saw that man, the one who'd chatted up my wife, he was the owner of the place, talking to customers, sending bottles to a table and complimentary Hors d'oeuvres to another. It all hit me like a ton of bricks. I had seen him before. I remember him shaking my hand, being annoyed... that look. His thick dark eyebrows and the little bell he rang every time he approached a new table. He was the man on my wedding photo. I could now remember feeling lightheaded right when he shook my hand, uneasy. I remember the wine doing much more damage than a couple of glasses usually did to me and my wife. And I remembered the nightmare I dreamt on friday night. There was someone in my home, in my bedroom watching over us. Someone stepping into our kids bedroom, snooping around the house and I was unable to do anything, and that little bell, ringing... ringing.

I couldn't figure out what to do. What had happened. All I knew is that my entire body was telling me that man had something to do with it. I waited outside, for that man to leave and I followed him. He took a cab, and I took the next. I gave the cab driver the full two hundred if he could just keep following him. AS we went through roads, the streets felt familiar. Every turn, getting on the highway, off on that ramp I took every day, then onto my street to see him park on my driveway.

I saw my wife come out to greet him, my kids hug him as they went inside to eat dinner. I can see them through the window, sitting at my table. Eating the food we bought just a few days ago. I can see him holding my wife's hand. I saw him ring that little bell that sent my kids to sleep, following the ringing as a practiced command. And all I can think of now is waiting for him to go to sleep so I can go inside my home and end this nightmare once and for all.
