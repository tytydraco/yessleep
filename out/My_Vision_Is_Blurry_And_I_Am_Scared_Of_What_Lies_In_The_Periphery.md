To whoever finds this, please don't look for me. My name is Jessenia and I no longer live here.

I saw a little boy across the road next to where I live. He was standing at the tree line near the forest with his back turned to me. It was a little eerie for how long he stood there, but as a mother myself, I couldn't help but grow concern for his well being. Was he lost? And if he was, how could his mother be so careless to just let him wonder off like that? Then, after taking only a brief step in his general direction, he began to walk down a slope towards the forest.

"Hey little boy!" I called out to him, awkwardly trying to keep the giant bag of food I had just gotten from the food bank from falling out of my arms as I crossed the street. "Hey, where's your mommy?" He didn't respond, but just kept walking further and further down the slope. He was getting to the point where I could barely see the top of his head. I quickened my pace to catch up to him, but he disappeared out of my line of sight for a couple of seconds.

"Hey wait-" suddenly, as I had stepped onto the sidewalk, I had regained my vision on him. However, I noticed he was very deep into the woods. I'm not a scientist or whatever, but even if he had slid down this slope, for one, there's no way he would look as clean as he did with all the rain, mud and dirt he'd have splashed around in. And two, I was basically running across the street. It only took me like 5 seconds to get there and he was only out of my sight for maybe 2 or 3 seconds. The distance he had travelled looked like it would have taken at least 20 seconds. And that's if you were running.

I watched a lot of horror movies growing up. I always hated the idea of being in any horror situation. And at that moment, I knew I was in a spot where if I go down that slope, I may not be coming back up. Mi abuela and I are very religious and we had a fascination with the supernatural when I was a little girl, but I never did anything weird. I didn't draw demonic symbols, I always kept a bible near me and I always prayed to god every night before going to sleep. I'll admit, I should have probably kept doing that last part.

I can't go down there. Everything is telling me not to go down there. It just doesn't feel right. But I also can't just leave him there. It's still raining really hard and if I abandon him, he could catch a cold or worse. After thinking for a good minute, I had a much better idea. I set my groceries down and adjusted my glasses, pulling out my cellphone to call 911.

"911, what's your emergency?"

"Yes hi, my name's Jessenia" I answered, pacing back and forth worriedly. "I'm by my apartment complex and there's a little boy who looks like he's lost in the forest. Can someone come down and help him?"

"Absolutely. Can we please get the address to where you're calling from?"

"Yes, thank you so much. I'm at East Holmes Apartments and my address is-"

The call ended. I looked at my phone. It was fully charged. Maybe I'm just getting bad service because of the rain? I don't know how cellphones work, but I tried calling them again. After it rang once or twice, it just hung up again.

There's no way they're actually hanging up on me. I literally just told them about a little boy lost in the woods... This is an emergency for goodness sake! I thought to myself. I shoved my phone back into my pocket and looked down to where the boy was at. He was still standing there.

I brought my finger to my lips and started chewing on it anxiously, looking around for someone, anyone to help. I DON'T want to go down there, but I can't live with myself if this is actually just a little boy who needs help. I kicked my foot down onto the pavement like a frustrated horse.

"Alright, DON'T MOVE! I'm coming down!"

I really, REALLY regret doing this.

I tried to balance myself as I took careful steps down the slope, occasionally sliding on the grass, fallen leaves and sticks a little, semi-surfing my way down before getting my footing back. I really didn't want my dress to get dirty, let alone fall all the way down and break something.

As I finally reached the solid, flat ground near the edge of the forest, I noticed he still hadn't moved at all. And now that I got a closer look at him, I could make out his details a little better. He had black hair and a bowl haircut, wearing blue suspenders over a brown long sleeve shirt. From what I could judge, he didn't seem to be more than maybe 8 or 9 years old and he looked fairly pale from what I could see.

I walked cautiously into the forest, with slow steady steps, barely even a few inches inside as I called out to him. "Hey... Let's go find your mommy... ok?" He gave no response. "I'm sure she's..." And as I got closer to him, "... worried..."

He walked further into the forest.

Nope.

I turned myself around, ready to run full sprint, but the forests edge was no longer there. Instead, a giant dark tree had appeared in my way, with more trees that stretched for what looked like miles. They were all dark and mangled. Some had leaves that looked like they were rotting for years, some had no leaves at all but the tips of the branches looked shriveled with decay. I took a few steps back, stopping myself with a small jump when I remembered the boy was still behind me.

I only turned my head just enough to see him in my periphery. I couldn't tell what he was doing, only that I knew he was getting closer. And while that was a terrifying thing to notice, there was something even worse.

I couldn't hear him. I couldn't hear the twigs on the ground snapping from his footsteps. I couldn't hear his clothes rubbing together. I couldn't even hear him breathing. But I KNEW he was getting closer.

Tears were welling up in my eyes. I shut them tight, squeezing my arms straight down into my sides, trying to keep them as stiff as possible. I couldn't help but feel them trembling as my hands clenched to the point where I think I almost made my palms bleed. I muttered a prayer and shook my head, hoping this was just some sort of bad dream. Suddenly, I finally heard something. It was a light breeze that tickled my nose.

I opened my eyes and he was in front of me. His body was facing me but his head looked like it didn't change direction at all. Like the back of his head I saw earlier was now facing me, despite his body facing forward. His head started shaking, almost twitching as it leaned down towards me.

Then out of nowhere, a black spray of mist shot out of his head. It was so strong that it had knocked my glasses off and shot straight into my eyes. I fell backwards and cried out, desperately wiping my face of the black liquid as I kicked myself away from him.

Everything was black for so long. It stung to the point where it felt like my pupils were somehow separating from my eyes entirely, like they were about to slide off. I screamed louder as I realized there was no way to get it out. It just stung deeper and deeper into me. It felt like a knife was cutting right down the middle, trying to split my eye in two.

I was struggling for minutes before I could finally open my eyes. I reached out around me and felt my glasses. They were covered in the black liquid and dirt, but I frantically tried to put them on regardless, wiping what I could get off as I slid them onto my face. This was a mistake.

I should have just got up and ran. I shouldn't have put them on. When I did, I saw the little boy in front of me, shaking and contorting into something else. Long, black, sludge-like limbs were bursting out of his ribs, legs and other parts of his body. What made this horrifying was the fact that I couldn't see him clearly.

Now when I say I couldn't see him clearly, you'd think 'well of course you can't, there's probably way too much dirt and gunk on your glasses!' But despite the dirt and grime that coated them, I could make out the trees perfectly. I could see the details within the branches and the leaves, the rocks and twigs on the ground, everything around was in perfectly visible and in focus.

Except for that thing. No matter how hard I tried to focus on it, it remained blurry.

And it was getting closer.

I crawled and stumbled to my feet, tripping over myself, crying out into the forest for anyone to help.

I brushed past the branches, bleeding from each limb as they scratched into me. I leaped over the fallen dead trees, only getting partially stuck in some mud as I tried to get away. I thought I was seeing faces in the trees, twisted and misshaped. I could have sworn on the lord almighty himself that some of them even had eyes. This place was the devils work.

Looking back, I may have only been running half a mile or so, but time made it feel like I was crossing a whole continent. I know I shouldn't have been able to get out, but god must have been watching me from above. I was begging in his name to save me. To guide me towards a light. And he did.

My feet slipped on the wet grass as I fell face first into the slope I had climbed down on. I didn't look back. I gripped the grass and dirt to the point where some felt like they were shoved deep into my nails, clawing with all my might to pull myself all the way up to the top of the slope. I grabbed my bag of groceries and ran across the street to my apartment and locked everything.

I didn't sleep at all that night.

"NO! YOU HUNG UP ON ME!" I screamed at the officer in front of me.

After spending almost the entire next day rocking myself back and forth, occasionally pacing to try and put together in my mind what the heck that thing was, I had finally pulled myself together just enough to turn my fear into a different emotion. Pure anger.

What were they even doing!? I had thought to myself. They're the police for heavens sake! Why did I have to risk MY LIFE just because THEY didn't feel like calling me back!?

These thoughts kept brewing in my head and I must admit, the things I had wished for them were pretty unchristian-like. But I mean, it WAS their fault. They should be held accountable and at the very least, send someone down there to figure out what's even going on. I mean, what if another person goes into the forest? What if they get lost and don't make it out like I barely did? I furiously marched down to the police department and when I reached the front desk, I let them have it.

"WHY WOULD YOU GUYS THINK I'D EVEN HANG UP ON YOU IN AN EMERGENCY LIKE THAT!?" The officer didn't look up at me, no matter how much I screamed at him.

"Ma'am, our department takes each call very seriously with care and concern," the officer said in a monotone voice as he wrote on a piece of paper. He wouldn't even look me in the eye. "If the line was disconnected in anyway, you need to take this up with your current provider-"

"You know what," I interrupted, "I don't EVEN CARE about the line disconnecting. I'm more upset that you guys didn't even send anyone! Can't you guys like trace calls to their locations and stuff!?"

He leaned back in his chair and sighed, bringing his hands to the back of his head. He was looking up at the ceiling for a moment before slowly meeting my gaze. I pivoted my stance, placing a hand on my hip as I stared him down. Why did it seem like he was being so hostile?

His cheek twitched as he cleared is throat awkwardly. "Ma'am, I'm trying my best to be reason-"

"Look," I interrupted. I was getting so worked up that my eyes were starting to water. "There's something bad out there... and if anyone happens to walk by that forest..." I brushed my hair out of my face, trying very hard to keep my composure. "Just..."

He looked down for a moment. Then right back up and me and let out a long, defeated sighed. "Alright ma'am. I'll send someone to check the tree line later today." He reached for his pen and pulled out his notepad. "Can you tell me where this took place?"

I sniffled as I wiped my eyes. "Are you actually going to send someone this time?"

He nodded.

"Alright," I continued, "I live at East Holmes Apartments. The fores-" 

He let out a small cough. Then he coughed again as if he was choking on something. However, the look on his face made it seem like he was about to shout something and held it back, forcing out a wheezing, dry cough instead. I leaned forward a bit. Just as I was about to ask him if he was ok, he raised his hand up.

"Hold on," he wheezed, then took a deep inhale and exhale. "I-I just remembered... I need to make a quick call to someone... Just one second."

I raised my eyebrow, then backed up to give him space since he was still coughing a little. He got up and made his way to the back room where he closed the door behind him. I stood there for a little, looking back and forth to see if anyone was around. Then, mischievously, I walked around the desk and just barely close to the window. Fortunately, despite a drawn down curtain covering most of the window to the room, there was just a small enough crack that I could kind of make out what was going on.

He made his way over to a desk and reached underneath it. What he pulled out was a phone. Not a cellphone, not even a modern day landline phone, but a vintage phone you'd see from... I don't know, maybe like the 30's or something?

He put his finger in each one of those weird hole things and pulled them across, dialing a long set of numbers. He held it to his ear for a while before he started speaking. It was hard to hear anything, but from what I could make out when I tried to read his muffled lips, I think this is what he said.

"Yes, this is officer Rick..." It was so hard to hear. I think he gave out his whole name and badge number before continuing. "East Holmes sir... A woman... Close to her mid 30's..."

I'm only 28, pendejo, I thought to myself.

"... -e step in?... -ear (something?) forest... No, where (division?) 7 was-... "

I was getting really uncomfortable with this. I wrapped my arms around myself nervously as I tried to keep listening in. It was so hard to make out, but it sounded like just a bunch of confirmations and permission requests at this point.

"... Alright... Will do, sir..." He hung up the phone, put it back under the desk and made his way out of the room. I had darted back in front of the desk by the time he had put the phone away and stood there as nonchalant as I could be. When he got out, I noticed he was much taller then I expected him to be and his whole persona had changed. He didn't look like the same disinterested man that had to deal with customer service anymore. Instead, he looked like he was ready to give me a warning. Like a parent catching a child doing something wrong.

"Everything is under control, ma'am." He now spoke in a more direct, stern tone. "We will be looking into the matter shortly."

I dropped my arms down. "That's it then? Are you gonna send anyon-"

"We will be looking into the matter shortly." He spoke almost with a growl this time.

He picked up his notepad and tucked it into his top pocket. "We recommend you go home. You have a good day, ma'am."

I wanted to say something to him, but as I was trying to figure out the words to say, he straight up just walked away, back into room.

I can't believe what just happened. I made my way back to my apartment frustrated, confused and even more worried then I was before. Are they really sending someone or did they just write me off? And what's with that phone? Why do they need an old landline to talk to their superiors?

When I got back home, I dropped my keys onto the table in front of the couch and went over to feed my fish. They were probably really hungry since I had been out for awhile and completely forgot to feed them this morning. I should probably mention that my son wasn't home at the time when all of this happened (Thank the lord). I had dropped him off at my mom's place for the time being so that I could finish wrapping some early Christmas presents I had gotten him a few weeks before. He had a knack for sneaking into places where he shouldn't and it totally ruined the surprise last year. Not this time, mijo.

I didn't know what the police were going to do, but I hoped and prayed they would do something soon. There wasn't much else I could do on this matter, so I made myself a nice bowl of soup, sat down on my comfy couch and put on a new movie that had just dropped on one of my favorite streaming services. It was a horror movie.

I know, I know. I literally just barely survived my own real life horror movie. But I had been waiting for this one for so long that everything in me told me that I NEEDED to watch this NOW. Plus, something about watching people making dumb decisions in horror films made me feel a little better about myself. Don't judge me.

An hour had passed and I was on to my second bowl of soup. The movie was getting really good, really tense. But something felt off inside of me. I felt tired, yet strangely awake? I thought maybe the soup from the food bank was just bad this time, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something else was going on.

I laid back on my couch to get comfortable, still intently watching the movie when I noticed my vision was going in and out a little. I shook my head and managed to regain my focus on the tv. Maybe it's food poisoning? Then something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye.

There's a light in the hallway that partially reflects off of my fish tank. It usually doesn't reveal that much other then the light source, a walk in closet at the end of the hall and some clothes that I lazily kept in a pile on the floor.

But for a brief moment though, I could have sworn I saw a figure standing just outside of my periphery, also reflecting off of the fish tank.

I wish the movie wasn't as good as it was. It was getting really scary. But now, with my anxiety telling me there was potentially something looming over me, my eyes started to shift just slightly back and forth, unable to make a decision on where I should be looking. Why did my mind have to play tricks on me right at the scariest part of the movie?

I laid there as stiff as I could be. I wanted to blink but thought that might be a bad idea. So I finally relented and shifted my eyes just a little bit to the fish tank. Not by much, just enough to see past the rim of my glasses. There wasn't anyone there. Praise. The. lord.

I closed my eyes and let out a long sigh of relief. I reached for the remote on my table but as I reopened my eyes, I thought I saw the figure again.

But bigger in the reflection.

I froze again. I felt my lungs trying to draw in more air then I should be able to, just to keep up with my rapidly increasing heartbeat. I suppressed it as much as I could, trying to be as quiet as possible with each small breath I could take in. I don't know why, but the presence made it feel like if I started breathing any louder, it would rip into me in the most gruesome way just to silence me. I tried to shift my eyes just a little again, barely able to see once again outside my periphery.

It was there. Long, black, sludge-like limbs and what appeared to be crooked antlers sprouting from its head. Worst of all...

It was twitching. And I couldn't hear it.

How did it know where I lived? How did it get in?

I couldn't hold my tears back. They streamed down my face as I tried to gently gasp in more air. I prayed in my head to make it go away. But then, as I felt like my prayer was long enough to write a novel, a terrible realization had come over me.

I really, really needed to blink.

I fought with every ounce of strength not to, but the salty tears felt like they were stinging into me. Please lord, I prayed to myself, don't let me blink. Please...

But I blinked.

Only for a moment. 

And the figure that was reflecting off of the fish tank in my periphery was no longer there.

But instead was now a mere few inches away from the side of my head.

Just barely outside my vision. Blurry and twitching.

I grabbed the blanket and immediately threw it on top of me as I curled up into a ball onto my side. There wasn't anything I could do. My breathing was out of control and if I didn't think of something quick, I felt like I was going to suffocate myself underneath this blanket long before it'd even try to harm me. Should I scream for help? Would the neighbors even hear me in time?

Just then, I felt something touch my shoulder. I whimpered as it pressed down hard, digging what I felt I could best describe as muddy, cold talons into me. The cushions of my comfortable couch felt like they weren't pushing into me as hard anymore.

 was pull me up slowly.

I was so terrified that when I tried to cry out, all that escaped me was a squeak of air. A mouse caught by a cat.

It doesn't make sense to me what happened next, but I thank you lord for watching over me. It pulled me up to the point where I was no longer on the couch, just hanging above with my blanket still over me. But then it stopped. Everything was silent. I was just hanging there in air for almost a minute before I heard something that sounded like... a small breeze. Then, out of nowhere, it just dropped me.

I stayed perfectly still for a long, long time. I couldn't hear it before so I had no idea if it was still standing there. I shut my eyes tight and shuffled uncomfortably for a moment. I can't just lay here. I need to know if it's still there. But I was just so petrified with dread. It wants to kill me. So why didn't it do it already?

I gathered myself as much as I could, breathing in as deep as my lungs would let me. Finally, I pulled the blanket off of me. I rolled off the couch, kicking myself up to run for the door away from the creature. But it was gone. Just gone.

I stood in the middle of my apartment for a long while, trying to take everything in. I blinked before realizing my glasses had fallen off the moment I had thrown the blanket over myself. I picked them up and put them on as I turned on every light in the apartment.

Even though all the lights were on, everything was blurry.

I tried readjusting my glasses.

Still blurry.

I hyperventilated and started to cry.

I still don't know for sure what happened, but I think it had stolen my vision from me.

Later on in the week, I went to get new glasses but no matter what they prescribed me, after a few minutes, it would just get blurry again. I tried to be rational. Maybe the food from the food bank did this to me? I had been eating their supplies for a few weeks now. But my thoughts always went back to that creature and the liquid that it sprayed in my eyes. I just don't know.

I can't tell you to this day why I still can't see, but I had decided to move back in with my family to save up money and find a better eye doctor for me. My brothers came to help me get all my stuff into a moving van and I now live with my mom again. She was kind enough to help me write all this out. To this day, it's still hard for me see anything. It's just so blurry all the time. I miss seeing the stars in the sky, the lake where the ducks would swim, the lights of the city, all the beautiful sights I had taken for granted. My sons face...

I have so many questions about everything, but the most important thing that matters to me is to get my vision back. I fear that if I don't, I might start seeing it again. If anyone else feels like they've seen something similar, do yourself a favor.

Run.

Get help.

And don't look.
