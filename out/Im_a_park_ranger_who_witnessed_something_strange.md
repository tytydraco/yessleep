It’s Christmas Eve, and that means holiday cheer. However, for me that always means work. I work at a national park, so I will not say the name for my privacy. 

Anyway, I work as a Park ranger, and I always work around the holidays. Despite what my coworkers think I don't mind the holidays. I just like the alone time, not many park rangers work around the holidays. 

Sure it's extra work, but it's always fine. Anyway, I'm telling you about this because of a strange occurrence I experienced yesterday. It was a slow day, most people were at home celebrating. I got a call on my radio about a missing hiker. It wasn't too far from my location so I took it. 

I hopped into my jeep and drove over there. As I was driving I noticed a big lump on the path. I got out of my car and walked towards it, it reeked. Unfortunately, I recognized the smell. It was a dead animal, I turned on my flashlight and it was a deer, its throat was slashed open and much worse was done to it. 

I'm used to seeing dead animals, but what happened to this deer made me want to vomit. I shivered, I grabbed a box from my pocket and pulled out a cigarette, and lit it with my lighter. It warmed my body in the frozen air. It's a bad habit I've been trying to break but I just can never break it. I went back to my car to call it in and drove past it. Then I heard the worst, and my tire popped.

 I went out to check it and it appeared that it was popped by a sharp rock. Unfortunately, I already used my spare tire and forgot to replace it. It appeared I would be walking, the missing hiker was only about a mile away, anyway. I looked up to see the clouds pull apart to reveal the full moon. I quickly heard a woman's scream. I ran towards the shout. “MISS!? WHERE ARE YOU!” I screamed. The scream became more beastly and animalistic. 

I turned on my flashlight when I stepped on something. Torn clothes, and a boot, women's size 7. Then as I was walking, I heard a branch break behind me. I turned around to see animalistic eyes. They looked almost human. I put my flashlight on the pair of eyes. It appeared wolf-like. I dropped my flashlight in fear. My brain screamed to run.

 My legs began to make me move in the opposite direction from whatever that thing was. I knew whatever it was chasing me. I heard its footsteps behind me. I ran praying that I could get away. I decided to head to my car. But the worst that could happen, happened. I tripped and tumbled down a hill hitting my head on a rock on the way down. 

Everything was becoming a blur, and I felt whatever it was bite down on my shoulder. As if instinct I grabbed my gun, remembering it was there I fired off randomly hoping I hit it. It ran off making sounds of pain. 

I knew I couldn't let myself pass out, I felt around my belt and couldn’t find my flare. I began crawling around in pain hoping I’d find it. I felt my arm getting numb. I laid over facing the sky with my gun clenched in my hand. Hoping it wouldn't come back. Everything went black, I woke up shortly after in a ranger jeep. 

It was the new guy. My arm was poorly tied with a rag. He looked over at me. “You got pretty banged up, what the hell attacked you?” He asked. “A monster” I responded. I don’t remember what he said as I zoned out. Eventually we got to the ER, and they stitched me up. 

Today strange things have been happening, when I was trying to sleep I couldn’t get a wink of sleep, I was just so hungry, I went to the fridge and ate the raw steak, eating every bit of it. I keep biting my tongue, it appears as if my teeth have gotten sharper too, the park said I could take the day off, but I refused. My arm feels better already.

 It’s strange, I’m a bit worried if I’ll see that thing again and if it will be my end on Christmas Eve, but I have to figure out what that thing is and make sure it can’t hurt anyone. I also know what it’s done to me. If anyone has info on the creature please tell me.
