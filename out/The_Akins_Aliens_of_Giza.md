For decades, the origin of the Pyramids of Giza have been pondered. Theories like it go as far back as aliens abducting cows in farmers fields, sighting of Bigfoot and Sasquches, and the Illuminati. Keyword: theories. None of them have been proven to be true until now. The year is 2067. Archeologists and government officials are scratching their head wondering where the hell the capstone of the Great Pyramid has disappeared to. And ever since then, laws forbidding the scaling of the pyramids have only been more stringent.

"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. It's been over a month in this whole. As a boy I never imagined I would step fourth the chamber of the King. It's not as spectacular as I imagined it to be. It's all just sandstone and more dust than my old apartment generated in a decade. But I can't play thus down either, it's still the coolest thing I had ever done in my life. Maybe when this is all over I can bring my kids down here. They would love this sort of thing. Oh I can hear Jackson already. "Dad over here, dad see this, dad what's that?" He's loved this stuff since he was a kid. Watched to much Indiana Jones. I'd say. Maybe a hint of Pirates of the Caribean too."

"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. Lieutenant Markus and I finally managed to get some good sleep last night. No longer do I fear this place. The first week here I got an hour of sleep only cause I passed out in the heat. These damn uniforms do not hesitate to contain heat. For fucks sake we aren't in Antartica anymore. We don't need inch thick protective gear, nothing in a several thousand year old tomb will awaken. And if you mean skeletons without muscle mass, they are a pushover. Ehh, this entry was to complain. We gonna be here a while. No sense is bringing the mood down complaining to Abraham, Markus, or Annabelle. Being trapped in a pyramid doesnt exaclty leave A LOT of room to blow steam."

"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. Today i began to start hearing strange noise from the depths of the tomb. They weren't all that apparent but they were just noticable enough to pick up. Strange when ever I hear those noises, I get a feeling like someone is watching me. Ehh, it's probably Markus or Annabelle. No sense in riling up the place with superstitious theories and concerns. Moods already bad enough down here. No need to fuel the fire with petty concerns of hearing problems."

"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. All I can think about is Jackson, Meela, and Lukas. I think those noises are getting to me. It's been a month and a half since I saw the lad, Jackson. He turned 17 three days ago. And I missed it. That's all for today. I just needed to vent some air. Blow some steam, y'know."

"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. The noises, it's as if they are beckoning me fourth unto the depths. I am not alone in my hearing either. Annabella and Markus have begun hearing shit too. But they got it worse. Allegedly, they're seeing shit now too. I haven't got that far in my delusions yet. What ever power resides above, please save us from these illusions."

"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. Things have gotten strange around here. Abraham has been more dedicated to his work in the recent weeks it's often days before we see him sleep in his cot. It's almost driven him mad I'd say. We've been down in hell for so long it's likely getting to him. We have all begged him to call in airsupport as we have found nothing but weird object though. Sort of reminiscent of my 1911 here. But they are more closely related to rock with hollow cavities inside them hmm, interesting.

"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. We have unearthed more discoveries. Longer rocks with more hollowed out sections inside. Some kind of scorching happened inside the rock too. Strange, it feels like igneous rock. Solidified magma. Yet even then, the scorching inside the rock feels like... I don't know... dust or ash. It's hard to say."

"Shame, it's almost Christmas. One i wanted to spend with Kiera and the kids. See them open their presents, and the joy on their faces.. I didn't really except 3 months ago to be exploring the Pyramids of Giza. And I NEVER expected 3 fucking months down here either! I feel like that shit I heard from my teacher Mr. Bradley was bullshit "joining the army or the marine Corps is an honorable thing to do." Bullshit... absolute bullshit..."

"There have been talk from Markus, Annabelle and Jun to scale the wall back to the surface. Thing is, we don't have enough rope. We thought of typing the rope together. Jun did the math. We would stop short by about 60%. Fuck it! It's time to do what has been planned for months. Relieving Dr. Abraham as Assignment director and duty. This begins tomorrow. This strikes the fourth month."

"Live broadcast begins in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Dr. Abraham. In accordance to the United States Military conduct c.2055. Those in second in command may subject their superiors to demotion for failure to procure desired results in times like this. Our health has declined rapidly. Teeth have been falling out. Sress has enveloped to consciousness of your subordinates. You are, here by, relieved of duty and honorably discharged from this assignment. 

Dr. Abraham
"No wait. I've come so close to cracking the mystery!!" 

First Lieutenant Faulkner, Ethan.
"You have been ordered and discharged. Displacement of one's self from Assignment QZ is recommended. Do you copy Dr.?"

Dr. Abraham
"Please!! these objects we have found are fascinating. I loaded one of them with the crystals we found. They are firearms of some sort."

First Lieutenant Faulkner, Ethan.
"And NOW you tell us this!"

Dr. Abraham.
"It is possible that a race of people came before us. Explain The Templo Mayor, Chichen Itza, and that mysterious one we found in Antarctic?! There were people before us!"

First Lieutenant Faulkner, Ethan.
"What people?! You are a raving lunatic. You had your chance to be honorably discharged. You are now being detained. You threaten our health and now you bring up pertinent information crucial in our well being and survival. Annabella, call in air support, we are leaving. Forever!"

Lieutenant Jameson, Annabelle. 
"Yes Sir!"

Dr. Abraham
"NO! NO!! NOOO!!!"

"Suddenly, with Dr. Abraham anger and cornering, he is transformed into a something that of a nightmare.

First Lieutenant Faulkner, Ethan.
"WHAT THE FUCK ITS THAT, SQUAD FIRE FIRE FIRE!"

"Air Support to Lieutenant Annabelle of the United States Marine Corps. Do you copy. We are T-minus 5 minutes away from QZ. Be ready for extraction."

Lieutenant Jun Serscho. 
"This is Lieutenant Sercho. We have a code red emergey. United States military needed. There are millions of them. HELPP!!"
