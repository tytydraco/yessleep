It began with all black.

And then my eyes snapped open.

Right away I could tell he must have been waiting for me to wake up for quite some time. Nevertheless, he still looked surprised as my line of vision went straight to his.

“Come on,” he spoke, extending his hand. “We’re already a bit behind.”

He looked a little exhausted, yet his tone was patient.

“But... I’m tired,” I protested, having barely let any time pass for my eyes to adjust to my surroundings.

“I know,” he said, taking me into the palm of his hands. “But the good news is, you don’t have to play anymore.”

Play anymore?

A clear flashback appeared in my mind:

Me, facing the porcelain white tiles of my bathroom shower, hot tears burning down my cheek.

“I don’t want to play anymore,” I had said, not even fully understanding what I meant back then. Everything felt so hopeless.

When he scooped me up I felt weightless. I had always struggled with feeling like a bag of heavy, wasted space my entire life... yet he picked me up so effortlessly that I finally noticed how much bigger he was than me.

He set me down on the floor gently and started walking ahead with my hand in his.

“Where are we going?” I asked.

“We’re going back to where I found you,” he said, not even bothering to look back at me.

“Should I have brought anything with me?” No matter how big my steps were, his giant ones always stayed ahead.

“No,” he replied. “None of your things will be of use to you when we get there.”

I guessed he was right.

To be honest, I always thought the things I had would bring me some clarity I had not been able to find before. But instead, they became ticks on the list of reasons why this game was never going to work out for me in the first place.

That desk I bought last Christmas? I had envisioned myself sitting at it late at night, rushing to put the finishing edits on that blog I always wanted to start. Instead, it sat full of old coffee cups and makeup I never bothered to put back in my vanity.

“What if I don’t want to go back there? What if I want to stay?”

As I asked this, he paused for a moment, looking down at the ground over his shoulder.

“You know, that’s pretty normal,” he continued, his pace a little faster now.

I stayed quiet the rest of the way. I understood then that nothing I said would change his mind. Everything around us was so far away, it felt like we were walking through a cloud of haze.

We approached a door, so seamlessly blended into the wall you’d hardly notice it from a few steps away.

“Are you ready?” he asked. I met his gaze and nodded, not sure of what else to do in that moment.

As the door opened into a room of pitch black, my attention shifted to another room I hadn’t noticed before, just to my right.

Everything had been quiet before. But now, it felt as if someone had hit “unmute” on the chaos unraveling in the room that appeared out of nowhere.

Out of the three teenagers standing over my lifeless body, only the girl let out a bloodcurdling scream. The two boys stood quietly in horrified shock, never imagining that the object they thought was an abandoned mannequin by the riverbed was actually a person. One of them had tried CPR, but whatever sign of life was there when they first spotted me had now completely disappeared.

My attention snapped back to the room in front of me as the darkness filled with a blinding white light.

“Go ahead,” he said. “We can try again in a few more years.”

I stepped into the room,

And everything went black.

The door closed as he grabbed the clipboard that had been attached to it. Under a box that read *Occupant Return Reason*, he wrote:

“Self-termination. Eligible for re-evaluation in 3020.”
