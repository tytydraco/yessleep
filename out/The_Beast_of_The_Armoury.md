The Armoury has stood steadfast and unchanging since long before my town was a haphazard smattering of copper mines and railway stations. Nobody can remember or even conceptualize of a time where there wasn’t a massive concrete eyesore looming menacingly over us all.

It’s an undeniably worthless building, as any weapons originally stored in the facility have undoubtedly been obsoleted with time. Worse, The Armoury takes up valuable space near the industrial district that mining companies have been eyeing for years. The building is technically owned by the municipal government, and the late mayor was willing to die on the hill that the concrete tumour was not to be taken down. Apparently, it’s an invaluable symbol of our heritage, or something.

The late mayor eventually did literally die on that hill, but it was of an unexpected stroke he had while driving. In the confusion and turmoil of trying to elect a new mayor, the mining company I work at was given permission to demolish The Armoury, provided that they take all of the necessary safety precautions beforehand to ensure that the building wasn’t packed end-to-end with deadly thermite or something.

Jason and I were tasked exactly for these safety precautions. Our job was to go inside the building, create a rudimentary map of the layout, identify anything valuable or dangerous, and leave. We thought the task would be a welcome break from the gruelling physical labour of our day-to-day.

For the first hour, we were right. The building was actually very interesting to explore. The entire massive premises was illuminated only by oil lamps dangling precariously from the ceiling. Obviously, since the lamps were completely burnt out over the centuries the building was abandoned, our only protection from pitch darkness came from the LED construction string lights we hung off the walls, and my flashlight.

The first several hours of the expedition were devoted entirely to a fruitless attempt to illuminate the excessively long hallways and map what we could see. The architecture of the building was asinine; numerous corridors led to massive empty rooms, some triangular or hexagonal in shape. My job was to draw the map while Jason set up the lights, and as we spiralled further into The Armoury the map was making less and less sense.

Three or so hours into the expedition, the map lost all coherence entirely as the hallways started to overlap. At one point in time, we could be standing in what we could literally see with our own eyes is a hallway, but on the map be in some insanely-shaped room (that made literally no geometric sense) that I know we encountered two hours ago. Mapping The Armoury was like mapping a nightmare; the architecture of the building was fundamentally incompatible with the principals of cartography.

Jason was angry. I can’t blame him; I would be mad too if some amateur cartographer fucked up so bad we got lost in a pitch-black ancient hellscape on a random Tuesday afternoon. He figured my map was wrong, and it was hard to disagree with his reasoning while simultaneously acknowledging the fact that my map had parallel hallways intersecting and literal dodecahedron rooms.

Jason was kind enough not to physically assault me right there in the hallway as he attempted to make sense of the chicken-scratch I called a map. I could see him physically resist the urge to punch me in the throat as his eyes darted to the map, then to me, then back to the map, then back to me, as if trying to see if I was playing a prank him. He took three deep breaths, then suggested through gritted teeth that we follow the lights back out of The Armoury and start from scratch.

I agreed, and he pushed past me back toward the way we came. He left me a couple metres behind.

We were making decent pace when Jason stopped dead in his tracks. When I asked him what was wrong, he murmured something unintelligible. I didn’t catch what he said, and asked him to repeat himself, at which point he grabbed me by the shoulders (he was a big guy) and physically dragged me to the edge of a bottomless pit.

I could see the LED lights circling down into the abyss, past the point they were even visible. There was no floor to the pit; the pure magnitude of the nothingness we were facing appeared to swallow up even the high-power industrial lights in the enormity of itself. My head was swimming even attempting to comprehend what had happened.

Obviously we couldn’t go back the way we came. The only alternative was heading further into the heart of The Armoury, in spite of our own better judgement. Jason took the lead again, as he was overcome by a frantic desperation to escape. When I checked my phone for the time, it read 9:30am. We were in The Armoury for about a half-hour.

I didn’t tell Jason this for two reasons: he wasn’t listening and I was concerned he would completely lose his mind. I get that time slows to a crawl when you’re not doing something you like, but I promise I was in the Armoury for at least four hours at that point, more likely six.

Eventually, we ran out of LED lights to hang up but Jason didn’t even notice as he soldiered on into the pitch black. I trailed behind him, attempting to illuminate his path with my flashlight, but he didn’t even seem to notice. When he turned a corner, he stopped in his tracks a second time.

I figured it was another pit, so I stepped aside so he could get past me. Strangely, after a couple seconds, he fell to his knees in complete despair of exhaustion or possibly elation. I asked him if he was okay, but he wasn’t listening.

He started to say something, but was interrupted.

In the dark, the first thing I identified was the movement. Even from five or so meters behind Jason, a gust of wind blew into my face. It was a shock, as the past five-odd hours I was surrounded by nothing but dead air.

The second thing I identified was the noise. Coming from where Jason was just a second ago, there was a wretched gurgling sound paired with a deep gasp. When the gasp ceased, the gurgling continued and grew louder. I turned the flashlight to the source of the noise.

I only got a glimpse in the half-second before I ran. I remember seeing bare legs protruding horizontally from a tumourous, beige, pulsating mass about the size of a car. There were teeth and there was blood. There were eyes, too, and I dropped the flashlight and ran when they darted to stare directly at me.

There was a doorway that had taken shape about a metre behind me. It wasn’t there before, but I didn’t give a flying fuck. When I burst through it, my eyes were assaulted by the oppressive morning daylight. I had escaped.

Jason didn’t escape, but that’s apparently because he never went in at all. In the months to come, my higher-ups assured me repeatedly that they sent me on a solo expedition. There is no proof of a Jason ever being employed at my workplace, and my bosses seemed uncharacteristically concerned that I was so dead-set that I didn’t enter alone.

When I told my full story, I was laid off with a substantial severance package. From what I hear, they postponed destruction of The Armoury after it came to light that my expedition only produced an incomprehensible map, an unbelievable story, and lost hundreds of dollars worth of LEDs.

I know that another attempt to tear down The Armoury is soon to follow. For now, however, it still looms over the industrial district, ever unchanged in spite of its very nature.
