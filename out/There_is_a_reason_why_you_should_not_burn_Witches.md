Let me preface by saying I have always been very honest about what I was. I’ve never had any shame with what I am, with what my mother was, my grandmother; and a long line of women stretching back to the seeming beginning of time.

I am a witch. I have always practiced, I have always had power; and not once have I ever harmed another living being. Not ever, despite what anyone might say.

Several years ago, I saw a shirt a young lady was wearing on a rare trip to town, it said “I am the descendent of the witches you forgot to burn.” That shirt made me laugh. I ended up buying one off the internet at the public library. I don’t have the internet at home you see.

I have been a self-imposed hermit for decades now. It’s for the best, I made a choice, and I have to stick with it. Back in the 70’s when I was still relatively young, something dark came to our town. Even I couldn’t ascertain where it had come from. Not even my mother or my grandmother or any member of our small coven could understand it’s origin. Regardless of where it had come from, it had come here.

We first became aware of this dark thing when the first child went missing. The little boy turned up later, dead and drained and emaciated like a dried cicada husk. We were blamed first, because of course we were. If there was anything from rain to snow to someone with a bad case of acne everyone in our town pointed a finger at us. Some did it in jest, some in habit, and some in outright and malicious hatred.

Edith had been the first once to sense the thing. I still remember that evening. We had met for tea, no witchy business at all, it’d had been a delightful afternoon tea; when the poor lady had clutched her pearls and gasped like she’d seen a mouse.

“Are you alright Edith? Tea too hot?” my mother had asked softly.

But I knew she suspected that was not the case. Not with the way her eyes narrowed as she looked at the middle aged woman.

“No! Dear heavens. Something has come to our town. I felt it pass through like a cold wind down my spine. Something wicked.” Tears were in her eyes as she spoke.

My mother nodded and poured out her tea, reading her tea leaves while the rest of us looked on in anticipation.

Her face was grim as she read what the bits of water logged tea leaves had to say.

“My dear ladies, we have work to do,” my mother said standing, wiping her hands on her apron as she stood.

And we got to work. Day and night, each of us using our particular talents to not only track the thing, but find a way to contain it.

Constance read her ancient tomes and texts. Mary tracked the beast to it’s lair using her divination skills. My mother and grandmother had their spells and potions, and I helped. My skills were in dreams and their interpretation. I spent many days fast asleep in medicine induced stupor to glean what I could about this interloper.

All I could learn was that it was ancient. Perhaps at one point it was worshiped, it had been summoned by those with less skill to do their bidding, instead it had killed its would be jailers and fled into the world; finding victims and blood where it could.

“Do you have a name Gretchen? Without a name to bind it our prison will not be as effective.” My mother asked me, her voice filled with concern and anger. Though thankfully that anger was not directed at me.

“No mother. No name. It has many names and the dreams have not revealed its true name to me.” I said softly.

“No matter. The magic and bindings will hold. Though we ourselves will be bound to it until our deaths,” my grandmother explained. Her voice was old and strained after so many weeks of working magic. She seemed as frail as paper, and as thin.

“And what about after our deaths Elizabeth? What then,” Mary asked, her voice sharp and worn thin of patience.

“Then it shall be free. Unless we can learn it’s true name and banish it from whence it came,” my grandmother said with a tiny shrug.

“A price we must pay to contain it. It’s been killing children. And it will not stop until it has gone through every innocent life in the town,” Edith said teary eyed.

We lay our trap. It was easy. I was the willing bait for the thing. I was the youngest, and mother and grandmother had filled me with potions and tinctures to make me more appetizing to the thing.

We lured it to a small cave located on our property. We needed somewhere private where prying eyes would not see us, and more importantly not disturb the thing once it was captured.

It came quickly, on it’s shadowed feet. It took no effort to hide itself, it was darkness itself. No prey escaped it once it had its eyes set upon it.

By this time over a dozen children and young women had been killed. More blame was laid at our feet. We were being threatened to our faces. Dead animals were being thrown into our yards, bricks with threats written on them were tossed though windows.

When I felt the things presence at my back it took all the strength I had to not run. Our magic was strong, and unbeknownst to the thing it was already trapped. I could feel the panic set in when realized it could not leave the cave. Whispered threats were uttered as it reached for me and found it could not grasp me.

It writhed, it screamed and begged, and it promised all manner of worldly goods and powers if it would let us go. We ignored it. We all took turns sealing the small cave with bricks and mortar. No easy task to do in the forest on unsteady ground but we managed.

When the final brick was laid our powers were tied to its containment, to its life and hopefully eventually death. As long as one of us lived it would be locked behind its prison of earth and brick.

But then we started to die. One by one as old age claimed us. My grandmother first, followed by my mother. Constance drowned on a trip to Florida Edith and Mary lived to be in their nineties, but the grim reaper comes for everyone in the end.

I am the last. I am in my eighties. I have never married or had children, though it was not for lack of trying. The rumors that it had been me and my coven who had killed those innocents all those years ago never went away, they only grew. And no man wanted me. I have been friendless now for many years now.

I have tried to find out the true name of the thing but to no avail. I have looked in books, I have scoured the internet and found nothing. I have reached out to other supposed witches and been met with scammers and liars. I feel so alone.

And now I am dying. The last few years the harassment has gotten so much worse. I have not been able to safely leave my home as when I do I am followed and stalked. I’ve been threatened with death, and today it seems like they have made good on their threats.

My home is on fire. The flames are creeping along my hallway and I can see the light from the fire getting brighter. And there is smoke, so much smoke!

Outside my window I hear them screaming. Screaming the same thing people like them have screamed for centuries.

“Burn the witch! Burn the witch!”

I have fallen to the floor and I’m coughing. And I am afraid. Afraid for myself and the others, there are many innocent people that live in this town now.

I can feel the thing stirring now. I can feel it’s anticipation. Once I die it will be free, and the bricks have already begun to fall away.

As the flames finally reach my door I feel pity. I have no illusions about the pain and fear this creature will unleash on the people of this town. And they are about to learn a very important lesson, one that will be written in the blood of their children.

There is a reason why you shouldn’t burn witches.
