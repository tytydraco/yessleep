My girlfriend left me. I went to work like any normal day and when I got home she was gone, along with most of my stuff. I had to get a new TV and furniture, as well as kitchen appliances. I got almost everything off craigslist for a nice price. Good thing the house and car are in my name or she’d probably try to take that from me too. 



The thing that has been odd though is now that I am alone, for the first time in 6 years, I don’t feel alone. I can feel her in bed with me still. See flashes of her moving around the bedroom, closet, or bathroom. Even though it’s a new bed and sheets I swear I can smell her too, something like her perfume and shampoo.



This might make me sound weird, but at first all this was comforting in a way. I felt like I lost everything, like I was an alien in my own home. But these things I noticed were like a flash of my old life.



Recently though, these things have become too real to be just me imagining things. It started in my dreams oddly. I kept having a recurring dream from different perspectives. I would be trapped in a dark room before a masked man would come in and stab me. The icy blade would throw me awake covered in chills. 



The other one was the same dream from an out of body perspective, where the same sequence would happen but the dream wouldn’t end after the knife. Instead I followed the killer outside. He would put the body in a big metal barrel and set it on fire. Then I would wake up with a hot flash.



But when I would wake up from this I felt comforted by a firm cold arm wrapped around my waist. I would spin around in bed, for the feeling to release and see an empty bed. Of course it was empty, maybe I was still half dreaming when I awoke. But it kept happening.



Three days ago I swear I heard crying in my closet. I just got off work and was pretty tired as I have been struggling to sleep with everything happening. As such I almost ignored it and continued making dinner. But the reality set in, maybe someone was hurt, or maybe I’m just going crazy. Either way I’m a pretty big guy and I needed to go check. I strode down my hall trying to look and sound confident with my body posture and movement. I definitely wasn't though.



As I made my way in my closet and turned on the light there was nobody. Obviously there was nobody, I live alone. I tried telling myself that over and over while fixating on a point in my closet. My pants parted on the bottom hanging rack in such a way it was like someone was sitting under them. I moved in closer and spread them to check behind. Nothing, except my carpet had some black marks on the floor. In the shape of two bare feet. Definitely way smaller than mine, I couldn’t have left them. I changed the lock on my door, my ex couldn’t have left them, and I vacuumed a few days ago, they couldn’t be very old.



I went into a panic, investigating my whole house. My pot of water boiled over in this time and made a huge mess in my kitchen. But I was alone, so I made dinner and went to bed. That night I had a new dream. It started at the same barrel but the fire was gone. The bones were cool. I watched him remove the charred bones and bring them inside the basement again, the blood was gone from the floor as he laid the burned skeleton down, I woke up on the verge of tears from fear and feeling of sadness I couldn’t place. I swear, on trying to go back to sleep I heard an “It’s okay” in my ear followed by a kiss on my forehead.



The next night I had the same dream, awoke with the same feelings, except nothing comforted me. Instead I had two words ringing in my head. Save Me. I barely slept that night and got ready for work in the morning. Milling over my dreams and subsequent experiences trying to see what I was missing. The only thing I could think to do came to me right before I left. I said aloud in my room, “If you need help, you got to tell me how.” Before walking down the hallway towards my front door.



This leads up to tonight. I just woke up from a dream and felt like I need to clear my head, organize my thoughts and such, before I uncover what I think I will. My dream tonight started where my last one ended. In the basement, bones on the floor. 



The man cut open the bottom of a mattress and removed some of the padding. He then carefully laid the charred bones inside. Pressing the padding back inside. And carefully stitched up the hole he cut. He then cleaned his floor and shampooed the mattress.



I knew what I asked last morning and could only assume the worst. My bed is flipped over ready to be checked. I’ll finish this when I get back I guess.



I don’t know what to think, how to feel. It was true. She was trying to tell me something, it just took me a while to understand her. I’ve been up all night. I had to call the police after finding burnt human remains in my house. They took my bed as evidence and questioned me to all hell. I told them the truth, how I got my bed off craigslist, we met at a public parking lot. The paranormal experiences leading up to tonight, followed by me opening the bottom of my mattress and finding her. They checked my hands and house for any evidence I did it but couldn’t find any. 



I’m terrified by the thought that I’ve been sleeping on top of a corpse for months. I just had to tell someone and this is the only place I could so soon after what happened. I’m going to post this and book a stay at a hotel for a few days as I want out of this house. Always investigate your used furniture. Who knows who the previous owners were or what they did with it.
