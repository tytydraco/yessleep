 

I hadn’t thought about the previous night, but seeing the rosary brought everything rushing back. 

I didn't have time to think about it though. I ran out the door all the way to the mailboxes just as the bus was closing the door. Thankfully the driver was kind enough to let me on anyway. 

It was a five-minute ride to school, then we had a 30-minute period for breakfast. I spent the whole time listening to music and writing poetry to stay distracted. 

I went through creative writing and English pretty easily. I talked to some of my friends during these classes. I apologized for not seeing them outside of school and said I just wasn't feeling well. I forced myself to not look around for the man. I couldn't look at him.

Chemistry was fun. We had a test on elements and did a lab, so I was able to stay distracted. Then I had physics. This was one of the classes where I couldn't understand the teacher. I slept through class.

When I got home, I took a two-hour nap before going to work. My shift was from five to ten. 

I was a hostess at a small, but nice restaurant/bar. The entrance was a room in itself. If I looked to my left, I could see into the doorway for the restaurant. Behind me was a glass door leading to the bar.

We were never really busy, but always steady. I was technically a hostess, but I would often grab glasses from the bar, and run them to the kitchen, bring customers drinks and condiments, and help servers wrap silverware. We all helped each other.

I tried to smile and be cheerful through my shift, but it kept falling flat. customers kept giving me awkward smiles when I talked to them about specials. I had a couple servers come up to me and ask what was wrong. I told them I was fine. I couldn't tell them about the man sitting right behind the glass doors watching me. They'd think I was crazy. I was sent home early.

It was dark, and I had to walk two miles, but at least I had my music. I put my headphones in and started on my way. I focused on the lyrics, singing along and only looking at the ground in front of me.

Half of the walk was through town. But when you turn onto my road, it is surrounded by trees on both sides, so thick you can't see through them. No streetlights either.

I was about halfway down the road when I became very anxious. I finally decided to turn around. He was crawling along only feet behind me. I started walking backwards and he moved with me. 

*BEEEEP*

It felt like my heart exploded and I jumped. But it was enough to break my stare. I turned and ran the rest of the way.

He followed me inside and stayed in my room with me. I finally broke down and called a friend of mine, Tara. Her family was very religious, so I told her my story.

“Okay, let me talk to my dad about it, and I’ll talk to you tomorrow and let you know what he says.”

I hung up. I took a shower. I could feel him just outside the curtains. I swear I could see his long hands wrapped around the edges of the curtains out of the corner of my eye. Somehow this was even worse than when I could actually see him. I could feel panic building and tried to wash as quickly as possible.

When I got out, he wasn't right outside. He had moved to the side, next to the toilet. He watched me dress, still smiling. Then followed me to my room when I was done. 

I stayed up all night. I read through my physics book, trying to teach myself what I missed in class. 

The next day I saw Tara at breakfast. We Got our food, then she pulled me aside to talk to me. She said her dad was willing to come over and anoint my room. He couldn't do the whole house without permission from my father. I told her that I would really appreciate it.

The rest of the week passed pretty much the same. School. Work. Insomnia. Nightmares. 

Until Saturday. I woke up without the White man. I briefly wondered if he was gone because of what I had planned. But I let it go. It didn't matter because for the first time in months I felt cheerful.

I made myself some eggs and bacon and ate and read while I waited for Tara to come. They showed up around eleven. My dad wasn't home, but that was normal on weekends. 

I opened the door so Tara and Tim could come in. Tim had a small container in his hand.

“It's Vegetable oil.” He told me “It isn't about what you use, it's your intent.”

We went into my bedroom, and he dipped his finger and put a dot on the top of my door frame. Another on the left. One on the right. One in the middle of the floor in between the door frame. We all held hands and he prayed for me and asked for protection for this entrance. We copied this process for both windows as well. Then I thanked them for coming, gave Tara a hug, and they left.

Things got better after that. I started talking to friends more. I started caring about their problems. I started going out again. The creature backed off. I could see him, but he stopped coming into my room. Just that small break from him made me feel peaceful. I could finally sleep again. 

For a few months anyway. One night I was lying in bed falling asleep to Adultswim and I heard it. That beautiful music box. 

I'm going to stop here for now. It could be a coincidence, but every time I start talking about him, I feel like I slowly lose my energy and after a while my memories get foggy. I apologize for how slowly I have to speak about my past. Goodnight, for now.
