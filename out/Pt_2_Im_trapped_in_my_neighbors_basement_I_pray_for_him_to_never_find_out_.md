When I said I wasn't going insane, I was lying. And lying hard. 

You don't notice it at first, but the levels of sanity  you lose in the dark ascend exponentially. When I was a little girl, just 7 or 8 years old, I was enormously terrified of the dark.

It's ironic how I would spend my evenings telling horror stories with my classmates so that then I couldn't sleep at night. The difference between now and then is that, at home,  I could call my parents and cry for help. Not here. If I dare to make the slightest noise, my fears are likely to be overtaken by reality.

I could do nothing but to think. I remember asking my parents, after I ran away from home,  if they would still look for me if I went missing again, if the police would look for me if I disappeared. 

I guess that, but that moment, my poor mother's heart had to be  completely shattered. My father's eyes, from whom I've never seen a tear, should had to be flooded. 

My siblings would be another story; they should have probably thought it was all a show to get my parents' attention. It's very likely that, as time went on, their worryings finally ended up overcoming those thoughts.

Despite doing nothing, I felt weaker and weaker every day. The mystery woman wasn't coming as often as before: I was starting to smell awfully (felt like a rottening potato) and, despite not being able to reckon the hours, the then almost-never-missing trays of food weren't appearing as beforeand hunger was starting to get the best of me.

On behalf of that, there were almost no changes in my *routine*. When she gave me more food than usual, I came to know a fasting period was coming ahead. Tried to ration the food as best as I could., t
Needless to say is hard if you can't see the food by itself.

You may also be wondering by now, if I couldn't see, how the heck was I able to drink ? I should spill everything if I wasn't able to see the glass. And I did. I even started to think I would die of thirst,  going as far as licking the fallen drops from the floor out of desperation.

Anyways, they say time and practice get you used to even the worsts of lucks.

Wrong:  almost everything. 

I never got used to the lack of light, the voices and things I thought I heard and saw deep in my madness and what I wish were dreams.

At all costs I avoided sleeping. Although I never wasn't really sure whether I was sleeping or not.

 In what I thought were my dreams, tall and thin figures, obese and disgusting beings, inhuman silhouettes approached to me with the sole mission to have fun with my misery. No matter how hard I tried to move or run away, my legs did not respond.

 Impotence was eating me from my insides. Day and night. Never left alone. It was horrible. It came the moment when I had no tears left to cry, and the only thing that helped me cope with my fears, was inflicting pain in my body to stay awake.

That was my life, every day, every hour and every fucking minute. Until one day... One day something changed. 

I woke up and, instead of the now familiar tray, I found my self holding a sheet of paper. A damn sheet of paper with something printed on it. It was a photo. I photo I couldn't see

I don't know why, but I couldn't contain my laughter anymore. A laughter of pity came from that cruel joke. A joke that was on me. A joke I couldn't see.

By then,  I didn't care if the devil himself would came to shut me down on that very moment. I was already dead and I just wanted, no, *needed*  to laugh. I wanted to laugh at myself. At my stupidity and my luck, for being the victim of a joke do gas black as the room I was locked in.

I laughed so hard that my whole body ached. I was so thin, so thin that my body could have cracked from laughing. It hurt, but it was liberating. It was either that or crying. You should know you need less muscles for laughing.

I was so immersed in laughing, I didn't notice that the door was opening, someone's eyes staring at me. My heart missed a heartbeat, maybe two heartbeats. It took me a while to realize that  it was her; the mysterious and crazy woman. 

Not being used to the light, my eyes hurt, making it even harder to see. I thought it was impossible, but she was even thinner than the last time I saw her. I thought she shrunk a couple of inches too. Maybe my eyes were deceiving me, but her hair was totally white; as white as it can be.

She sat next to me. Looked at my face for a while like looking for something, *someone*, and started  talking, carefully pronouncing every single word with a *very* sweet voice.

*I know you probably don't  want to talk to me right now* She hesitated for a moment before continuing, trying to hold back what I thought were tears *You might also have many doubts, which I would like to answer, but I feel like now is not the right moment, plus I don't feel capable to...* She coughed a little before continuing. She was really making an effort to talk 

*Whose picture you're holding in your hands, is... *was* my son's: Tom. He took it when he was 15 years old or so,  your age I think*... 

I completely forgot about the photo. Finally being able to see some  light in those circumstances was so miraculous by itself that was having all my attention. 

When looked at the picture, I immediately noticed his messy black hair,  his really nice features and his beautiful blue eyes... *his mother's eyes*

*My husband was a monster," she continued. *I didn't realize that when I first met him. He was so sweet and kind that I didn't hesitate for a second to run elope with him when he asked me to. I was head over heels for him. And I thought he loved me too.... When I had my first child, his true nature came out. My baby was the only reason why I kept taking all that abuse. I tried to protect him, I really did. But when a child became three,  I had no energy left to keep going on. To endure the pain The time came when  I stopped disguising my wounds and hiding the pain...* 

She stopped talking for a moment, trying to decide wether to say what she was going to say and if yes, how to say them.

She stuttered a little before being able to formulate the next sentences. 

* When Thomas was born, all the abuse redirected towards him. My husband made it his main and only goal in life to cause him pain in order to fulfill every and all of his twisted fantasies.  I was... I was so relieved that I wasn't taking all his shit. I ignored his screams. Somehow let it happen*.

She closed her eyes, sighed, and began to cry.

*The day came when he killed him,* she said, raising his voice with every word,* the fucking son of a bitch killed my baby, his own son, beating him to death. And then the damn coward killed himself too, And I consented to it, because I once loved him... because I once loved my children... Because I loved myself... And I regret, I regret it every single second of every single day. I regret ignoring him, letting him die, my baby. I can no longer sleep, I can no longer eat, my children no longer want anything to do with me.... You don't know the pain a mother feels when she loses a child. That day... *That I lost them all... And I know... and I know that the day will come. The day will come when we finally meet in hell and I'll make sure he finally pays for everything he's done** 

Then she screamed. Hid her face with her hands and sobbed for a while. 

We where like that until she suddenly went silent, wiped the tears of her face, raised it and looked me straight in the eye, filled with determination.

 *It won't be long* I heard her say. *I promise, just... Just  hold on  for a little longer. We'll both get out of here, trust me, but I need you to be quiet, really quiet for a while. I'll get you out of here. And someday you'll know truth. But please, you need to trust me first*... 



*How could I?*  

I was confused. Very confused. Did that woman intended to turn me into Thomas or something? Was she delusional? Was that why she had kidnapped me? 

It was so crazy, but I honestly would be surprised if it was the so named *truth*.  She looked so haggard. So pitiful. No matter how hard I tried, something in me couldn't hate her, even though, for starters, she was the one who took away my freedom and locked me in that place. Not that I felt sympathy for her,  but I had the feeling  that I was missing a piece of the puzzle. I felt like,  without it, I was in no position to judge yet.

When the door closed, I was again submitted back into darkness. That familiar but still strange darkness.

Now, I deeply wanted to believe, once again, in the hope. The hope of one day being finally free.

For the last time in my life, I was a child again.

Just an innocent child who believed n fairy tales once more.
