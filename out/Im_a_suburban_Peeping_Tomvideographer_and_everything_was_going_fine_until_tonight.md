I fucked up. 

I knew better than to do it in my own subdivision – you do not shit where you sleep and all that – but could I resist? 

Could I control my own impulses for once in my miserable goddamn life?

Of course not. 

I shouldn’t have been doing this in the first place but, my God, if you’re going to do it, stick to those other two subdivisions. Hundreds of houses, thousands of windows, but you couldn’t help yourself, could you? You just had to creep up to hers. You just had to walk across the street to fucking Marcy’s house. Like a moth, fatally yet irresistibly, drawn to the bright light of that bedroom window, you could not help yourself. 

And you got caught. Not just red-handed (whatever that means); because you got caught worse than that. You got caught with your phone in one hand and your worthless micro-penis in the other. 

You got fucking tackled by her husband, Brian, who you didn’t even know had that in him. Such a seemingly gentle guy. A good dude, too. That look in his eyes when he saw it was me is a look I will never forget for as long as I live (however long that is). 

In that moment, in the moonlight, lying in that damp grass with those fucking sprinklers going off, all my secrets laid bare, he saw me exactly as I am. 

A guy who is shockingly not who you thought he was. 

Marcy knows too now. 

The whole neighborhood is going to know in the morning. You’ll probably have to register as a sex offender. 

You’ll probably get dragged off to jail. 

My wife will know. 

My kids will know. 

My son. 

My *daughter*. 

Jesus fucking Christ. 

I’ll lose my job for sure. I’ll get disbarred. Kiss my whole legal career goodbye. 

I’ll be the subject of ridicule. “Juvenile Justice Lawyer and Pee-Wee Hockey Coach busted as Peeping Tom.” You can see it now. Probably one of those headlines people email each other on slow Fridays at work.  

All because I couldn’t fucking control myself. 

Because the thrill – that electric current that would surge through me from being where I wasn’t supposed to be and seeing what I wasn’t supposed to see – was simply too great of a temptation to resist. 

At least it was when it came to the possibility of finally seeing Marcy and her perfect fucking legs and ass naked and perhaps even better, recording it all so I would have it forever. 

Because there’s nothing worse than a faded memory. 

Well, I suppose there are a few things worse. 

What I wouldn’t give to have just gone home instead of going into that backyard. 

It’s like a nightmare I can’t wake from. 

My biggest problem is that I can’t pretend this was a big misunderstanding.

Even if I wanted to, I can’t. 

Because Brian has my phone. 

And there’s no way he’s going to give it back to me. 

I’ll be ruined forever. Would he have sympathy for that? 

If someone was creeping around outside my bushes, taking video of my wife while jerking off, just a matter of feet from where my kids were sleeping… 

I wouldn’t. 

And neither will he. 

No. In the morning, he will call the police (if he hasn’t already). 

And my phone will become evidence. 

They will jailbreak it. 

They will find all my videos. Well, all that are in the cloud, which is enough. But that will lead to a warrant for my house, where they will discover the LaCie external hard drives which contain more of the same. Like they would need more evidence. That stuff on the orange LaCies is just gratuitous damage. Insult to injury, as they say.    

If only I could go back in time, undo it all, I would. 

I just don’t know where it all started. 

 

Where did it all begin? 

The simplest answer would be in the pool house. Or perhaps my mother’s art studio (before she stopped taking her Lithium and slit her wrists in her clawfoot tub like Marat). 

I would say I grew up well-to-do, upper middle class. 

My wife says “rich,” but everything is relative (we’re not rich now). And she knows I’d give it all back just to have a “normal” family. She says there’s no such thing but I just mean a father who was not an icy philandering sociopath and a mother who was not a manic depressive sculptor of female nudes. My sisters were older and mainly out of the picture by the time I came of age. But that’s not to say they didn’t occasionally return to our house with their very attractive college-age girlfriends and go swimming. 

It just so happened that right around the time I discovered girls, I also happened to discover that if one was to lie under the door of the pool house changing room, one could get a nearly unobstructed view of whoever was changing, showering, peeing on the toilet, off the reflection in the Italian marble floor. 

Thirty-some years later, I can still recall their names and the shapes of their bodies: their tits (Christina and Meredith); their curves (Betsy); their bushes (all of them, it was the 90s). Those were my favorites, and the ones I saw most frequently, but I must have watched at least 20 or 30 of them parade their wares. I can still feel the cold of the marble against my cheek, my shallow breath momentarily clouding it with condensation and the way my dick – a diamond cutter back then, although still comically small – pressing uncomfortably against the equally unforgiving cold marble floor. 

Real life and the girls I encountered in it forever thereafter, could never compete. 

I suppose the women I spied naked in my mother’s art studio even before that played a part in the warping of my psyche as well. Those women, while never as attractive or as overtly sexual as my sisters’ college friends, probably laid the groundwork for what became my inexplicable attraction to much older women – I’m talking women 20 to 30 years older than me. An attraction that somehow aged with me. Meaning, even now in my early 40s, I still find myself attracted to women in their 60s and even 70s (not women in their 80s – I’m not some sort of pervert). 

Who am I even writing to now? 

Is this some sort of confession? 

And why am I writing? 

Is this a goodbye note of sorts? 

You swore to Christ you would never do that. 

I suppose there is no clear answer. 

And if there is, I don’t have it now. 

I think everything is on the table, as it were. 

I will admit that I now have my gun on my desk as I write this. 

What am I going to do with it? I don’t know. My wife and kids are asleep in other rooms (sleeping, what I suppose will be their last night of normal, wholesome, uninterrupted REM sleep). At least for some time. 

I don’t think I ever slept well again after Mom… 

I’m not going there. I’m just not. 

What are my options then?  

Option 1) go back over there and try to reason with Brian and Marcy before they call the police (again, if they haven’t already). I should peek out the window and see what’s going on. OK, I’m back and it looks the same except they’ve now turned their floodlights on and there appears to be a light on in the back of the house, a room I now know is their bedroom. 

Option 2) go back over there and demand my phone back (by gunpoint if necessary); the obvious problem with this is that it would escalate things even further and expose me to even more criminal liability; unless I was successful, in which case, I would still need to hide from them every day until we move (which I suppose is an inevitability at this point anyway). 

Option 3) I could just call Jerry. He’s a pretty good criminal defense lawyer even if he does just plea every single one of his clients out. Would a plea be the worst thing? 

Option 4) I could go wake up my wife and try to get ahead of this. Or: 

Option 5) I could… I’m not even going there. Not yet, anyway. 

 

So, what’s it going to be then, eh? 

I should have known it was going to end like this. 

And none of this would have happened if I hadn’t started taking my “night walks.” I told my wife they were to “clear my head” without the distraction of having to bring the dog. 

Walking the dog during the day was how I first encountered Marcy (and Brian). It was the summer we moved into the subdivision and I was struck dumb when I first encountered her on the sidewalk. She was petite and tan with the most perfect set of legs I had ever seen. I’m not even a leg guy but I wanted hers to wrap around my neck and squeeze my head, vicelike, until my eyeballs popped out. And she had these impossibly tiny white shorts on. I thought she was in her 20s or 30s. It wasn’t until I got a bit closer and noticed the wrinkles on her neck that I realized she was 20 or 30 years older. 

But of course, that didn’t deter me. On the contrary. It made me want to see her posing naked for a sculpture. 

Our dogs looked alike so naturally we allowed them to meet. Small talk was exchanged. Yes, my family and I had just moved into the Thomas’ old place. We just relocated from the West Coast to be closer to my wife’s family. A son who’s twelve and a daughter who’s nine. Yes, we’ve heard the schools are great. So nice to meet you. We’ll see you around. 

And we did. 

My wife and Marcy became fast friends. They decorated the subdivision’s communal property at Christmas three years in a row. They frequently met up and drank wine at another neighbor’s house. I continued to make small talk with Brian whenever I would bump into him, usually on the sidewalk while walking our dogs. Even our dogs liked each other. What more could you ask for? 

Of course I thought of Marcy every time I fucked my wife. 

I’m not proud of it but how could I not? 

You get tired of fucking your wife. 

You even get tired of pornography eventually – at least I did.

I needed something different – something real, something visceral – and so one night, I decided I needed to get some fresh air. I went for a walk by myself (leaving my dog at home).  

I was walking on the sidewalk through a neighboring subdivision when I saw a woman sitting on the couch in her front window. The curtains were open and I could see that she was in her robe, just watching TV. 

She was not an attractive woman (not in the conventional sense). If anything, she was somewhat heavyset. I might even say fat. But her face was not unattractive and she had extremely large breasts that seemed to almost spill out of her black silk robe. 

But perhaps more than anything, I could see her and I knew she could not see me. 

I stood across the street and just watched her for a minute: The way the white light of the TV flickered across her expressionless face and those massive tits of hers in that darkened living room. 

I wondered if she was alone. I wondered if she knew she could be seen by strangers. 

She must have. 

I suddenly began to feel alive again. Standing there under a streetlight in the dead of summer, I felt like my cheek was pressed against the cold marble of the old pool house. 

I telepathically pleaded with this woman to disrobe and give me a show, and for a split second, as she stood up, I thought she might – but then I saw the headlights of a car approaching and I reluctantly continued on with my walk. 

But the seed was planted. Or replanted, as it were.  

I went home and jerked off to it. I came almost immediately.

I knew the next time I went for one of my walks, I would photograph it (or better yet, take video of it with my phone). That way, I would have it forever and I wouldn’t need to rely on my memory, which is fallible, less immediate, and, over time, fades. 

What I wouldn’t give to have even grainy VHS video of Christina, Betsy, Meredith, and the like, bushy beavers and all. 

 

But all that’s gone now. It’ll be some time before I jerk off to anything again. More likely than not, I’ll end up in a jail cell, being someone else’s obsession in a communal shower. Someone stereotypically named Bubba. Why is the prison rapist always named Bubba? Someone should look into that. 

The night walks were harmless enough. My wife certainly didn’t complain. Often, I would return home horned up. Sweaty from the walk, I would shower, think about what I had seen – sometimes furtively reviewing the rough footage I had just taken through half-open blinds and curtains – and I would emerge from the shower primed for lovemaking. 

My wife loved it. She felt special. She probably figured I had been thinking about her while I was out casing the neighborhood. 

If only that were the truth. 

As I said, many of the women I taped were not conventionally attractive. Many were overweight, somewhat homely, and almost all of them older (I’ve never been into younger girls or even girls my age). But what turned me on was the excitement of the viewing. The trespass. The danger of getting caught.

Unlike when I was a kid in the 90s, the entire world is now under constant surveillance (even from space). Nearly every home has at least one camera running at all times and there is an infinite number of motion detectors and lights that make sneaking around an extreme sport. It’s definitely not what it used to be. 

Sometimes it makes me sad that kids today will never know what it felt like to just walk around unseen and untracked late at night. 

Where was I? 

Oh yes. My night walks. The women were – with only one or two exceptions – not attractive (definitely not my sister’s gorgeous college friends showering or my mother’s naked models posing sensuously in her studio for hours on end). And I was OK with that. 

But not far from the back of my mind was Marcy. 

But I knew I couldn’t go there. 

That was one place I could not trespass. 

So of course that became my ultimate fantasy. Marcy became my holy grail. 

But I swore I would never go there. The stakes were simply too unbearably high. 

Then, CUT TO, tonight.  

 

After a hellish day at work, and a late family dinner of Chinese take-out that left me wholly unsatisfied not just a half hour later but somehow even while we were eating it, I decided I would take one of my nightly walks to “decompress.” 

I prowled around much longer than usual. I began at the other subdivision, where I first saw the Rubenesque woman who kickstarted my foray into peeping (she had long since moved away and I never saw her again after that initial sighting) but tonight there was nothing to see. One window featured a Latino kid kicking a Nerf soccer ball against his closet door. Another picture window led to an unfurnished room (someone getting ready to move in or perhaps out). Another back slider offered me a view of a grown man sitting at his desktop computer as he seemed to be stressing over bills (though I could have been projecting). Frustrated, I walked to the other subdivision in our neighborhood.

Somehow that was even worse. There was, simply put, nothing to see. It just seemed as if the entire world had conspired against me and decided to close its collective blinds. 

So I began walking home and just as I approached my house, I could see the light in our master bedroom was on. I intuitively sensed that my wife was lying on the bed in her nightie, expecting for us to be intimate after my walk as we had often been in the past. 

But I wasn’t sure I could go through the motions without some sort of sexual jolt I had become accustomed to. That was when I decided to break my own rule. And I decided to walk over to Brian and Marcy’s. 

I didn’t expect to see anything salacious or great – her splayed on the bed naked; or her getting fucked silly while watching porn or anything spectacular like that. I was simply looking for something – anything – to get my juices going. To feel alive again. 

I went to the window in the back and that was when I saw it. She was lying on her bed, watching a Lifetime movie in gym shorts and a tank top. 

My heart rate quickened just seeing what her bedroom looked like: The four-poster; the 65” OLED flat screen; the beige duvet and the mattress on which she slept. 

She reached down and scratched the inside of her thigh. I thought she may be getting ready to masturbate (wishful thinking) so I took out my phone and hit Record. At this moment, I still probably could have gone home with the little footage I had and fucked my wife like a normal man but instead, I did what I always do: I got greedy. 

I unzipped my shorts, took out my dick, and began fondling myself. As I zoomed in on her inner thigh, I heard what sounded like a loud carbonated pop in surround sound. 

Sprinklers. 

As water began spraying my ankles, she must have turned around and saw me. 

When I looked back in the window, she was gone. I took a step closer, standing off to the side, peering around inside but I saw nothing. It was just as I took that step back when Brian tackled me and took me down to the ground. 

I never heard him coming and I certainly never saw him until he was on top of me.  

I struggled to get up and that was when he saw me. 

At first it was a look of confusion. Then, for a moment, I thought he was going to laugh. But it was just a momentary facial contortion or tic – probably his shock turning into betrayal which then quickly metastasized into a rage I didn’t know he was capable of.  

“Fuck are you doing out here, bro?” 

He had never called me or anyone else “bro” before. 

I was catching my breath and getting ready to invent some sort of excuse but then I saw him look at my dick – the sad little mushroom head of my pathetic penis popping out of a tuft of overgrown pubes. Already small, it had retracted even further with the cold of the wet sprinklers and with the violence of the sudden trauma.  

“Seriously, man. What the fuck?” 

He then picked up my phone. It was open to video. 

For the first time in my life – a life that has been spent talking and spilling words indiscriminately – I had nothing. I was speechless. 

“Get the fuck out of here,” he said. 

But he was still holding my phone. And I couldn’t bring myself to ask him to give it back. It didn’t seem like he would anyway. So I turned around and walked back to my house. I did not run. But I could feel his eyes – and Marcy’s – burning laser-like through my back. 

I let myself in through the back gate. I zipped myself up and caught my breath, then slipped back inside my house through the back door. 

My wife was asleep in the bedroom. As predicted, she was in her nightie but she had her earbuds in and she had already fallen asleep listening to one of her True Crime podcasts. 

My son and daughter’s doors were both closed. My son hadn’t been feeling well earlier in the day so I imagined he was already asleep. It was past my daughter’s bedtime so I knew at a minimum, she was in bed with the lights out. 

Inside the house, it was so quiet and peaceful; it was as if what had just transpired outside, had not really happened. 

And I wished to God that it hadn’t. 

That’s when I came into my office and began typing this. 

I just now realized my shorts are still wet. 

Now I need to figure out what I’m going to do. 

 

Marcy and Brian know that I’m a sicko. They’re going to call the cops if they haven’t already. I have a loaded .38 on my desk, which I still don’t know how to shoot (I bought it to “protect the house” but I never fired it once). Couldn’t this right now be classified as “protecting the house?” 

My house *is* under attack – or it will be. 

*I* am under attack. 

My family will soon be under attack from God-knows-what. 

I need to protect them. 

What am I going to do? Shoot Brian and Marcy? 

And what about *their* kids? 

I suppose there’s another option but… Fuck, I can’t go there right now. 

The only thing I can do right now is to go downstairs, wake up my wife, and break the news to her. I must tell her that the neighbors – Marcy and Brian – caught me jerking off in their bushes while I was videotaping Marcy through their bedroom window. 

I do not know how I am going to disseminate this information. I fear it’s beyond anything my wife can comprehend. I fear that it will simply not compute because the person I am talking about and these things I am describing do not comport with the person she knows. It’s definitely not the person she married.  

She knows me but… she doesn’t know all of me. 

Do we ever fully know each other? 

So that’s what I’m going to do. I’ll take the gun with me just in case. I don’t need my kid coming in here and finding it. So I’ll take it with me. 

I’ll tell my wife what happened and then we’ll take it from there. 

Let the proverbial chips fall where they fucking may. 

As I typed that last sentence, the doorbell rang.

And now the dog is barking.  

Fuck.
