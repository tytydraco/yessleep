Time. 


Time has never been a friend to me. More like a distant ethereal reverie of a woman I once knew. Except I never knew her, never met her, I’ve only ever heard her tale. Heard of her soft cradling hands and her gentle long locks blowing in the wind.
A Spector. 
The fragments of my memory are all holders of a facet yet have no perceived relationship with Lady Time either. Even the beast inside me, birthed millennia ago has no sense of the allusive Goddess. 
The collective fears we will never find her. 
Memory. 
Fragments held by different idols. 
Found, discovered, treasured. 


One of my first memories, revealed to me in a dream. Confirmed to me by my mother much to her horror. 
What do you tell a little girl when her nightmares turn out to be true? 
I’ll never forget the darkness which overtook her eyes when she realized I did remember. When she knew that it was not a nightmare but my hidden reality. 
I remember the cicadas. 


Some call them heat bugs because their wings bring on the summer heat waves. Wings like the harbinger of fate. 
Dreadful rising…
rising in pitch and finally echoing off into the endless distance. 


Noise insects of change. Insects of life and death and rebirth.
Screaming and chirping drilling through my ears into the night. 
Screaming and whirling. 
Buzzing and humming. 
The beat of my own heart. 


My father screaming. 
The shattering of glass. 
My mother crying.


I remember I burrowed myself under the seat of the car. Pulling and clawing desperately at the foam of the seat, fear coursing through my small body. I was desperate for safety. My flight instinct on full blast as my tiny hands carved away a path to barricade myself in from the chaos around me. My need to escape the shattered glass of the white trucks window and the harsh howlings of my parents. 


My first memory of childhood rediscovered. And my only memory of my father, whose face was too obscured in my mind for me to conjure. 


Fatherless, broken, and I hardly even knew it then. I was too young for the reality of my cards handed to me to sink in and too unaware of how unequipped I was to play the game. It would come to be that my memories were increasingly fleeting and it would come to be that my childhood was shrouded in mystery. 


Oh, Little did I know of the labyrinth of my own mind. Memory is a beast at the mercy and command of our minds. 


I reflect this all now only in my grown age, perhaps in a different time and space all together. 


What is time and space anyways? Who is to say?


As for myself, you can call me the Shaman. This book is my memory, my grimoire, my brain, and most importantly my spirit. If you are reading it now, two things may be happening. The first possibility is that I am somehow dead. There is a theory I read once that suggested all we experience and remember are simply the flashes of our last waking memory while on the crux of death. If I am in fact already in the arms of my beloved then this was meant to put thrust into the world and before your eyes in any possible avenue. It is no surprise you are here. 


Learn as I once learned. 


If I am living however, then perhaps it is the Gods, the cosmos or fate itself who brings you before my words little witch.
