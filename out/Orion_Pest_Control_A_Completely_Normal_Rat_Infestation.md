When it came to fulfilling my debt to the Houndmaster, I was skeptical. Things are *never* easy with the Hunters. This couldn’t just be a regular ol’ rat infestation. Were they enchanted? Did they breathe fire? Were they of unusual size?

Yeah. If only. The Dread Pirate Roberts never had to deal with this bullshit. I might need a vacation.

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U) 

On the day I was scheduled to come out, I loaded up the truck with enough salt to mummify a small village, a spare hagstone, and my mundane pest control equipment. I wasn’t sure what to expect, so it seemed prudent to be prepared for anything. And since she didn't specify that I was to come alone, the boss offered to come along. Partially to ensure my safety, but also because he had to blow off some steam after getting into a twenty minute long phone argument with someone from that motherfucking development company. 

Yup. They're back. It's not over, after all; apparently, one of their chairmen being mutilated wasn't reason enough to maintain the alleged 'indefinite postponement.’

That makes me wonder about them. They were pushy about the first development they brought to this area, but they didn't receive nearly as much pushback as they have now. There was still plenty of it, mind you, however the space they took up before wasn't occupied by something as terminally territorial as a Wood Maiden or a False Tree. To summarize, we had minimal escalated Housekeeper cases until that suburb was built. 

Now, it almost feels like they're targeting these protected areas on purpose. 

“They want us to get rid of the Wood Maiden,” Victor ranted on the way to the Houndmaster's address. “Apparently, what they took away from the last few weeks is that more aggressive measures should be taken against the ‘local wildlife,’ as the *nice* lady on the phone put it.”

The way that he practically spat the word ‘nice’ told me everything that I needed to know about how this lady’s demeanor must’ve been. 

The groan I let out came from the heart. Seeing as I was driving, I had to fight the urge to throw my head back in frustration. “You've got to be *kidding* me!”

“Nope. And if Orion doesn't take the job, she said that they’ll find someone who will.”

I spared a moment to balk at him. All I could do was repeat, once more with feeling, “*You've got to be fucking kidding me.*”

“That's what I said.” He huffed. 

“We're not accepting, right?”

“*Hell,* no. Fuck them, and fuck the Avalon.”

When I got to a stop sign, I made sure there was no one behind us before taking a moment to face him so that we could discuss this properly. 

I asked him, “What exactly are we planning to do? Anything?”

He sighed, rubbing his temple with two fingers as if trying to blow up the development company with his mind. “We tried talking to these people back when they messed with the False Tree, and it didn't work. Neither did threatening them. I’m done trying to save these people from themselves. This time, we're just going to let nature take its course and do our best to make sure that no one in our operating area gets caught in the crossfire.”

Later that day, the River Kingz let us know that the development company reached out to them about the Wood Maiden. Naturally, Sam outright told them to get bent. As of right now, we're not sure who else the company has contacted. All I can say for sure is that things are about to get ugly. *Very* ugly. 

Like Victor has said, we're just going to focus on our turf. Do what we can to keep those that live here from ending like those poor randos that got roped into the Wood Maiden's vendetta against the chairperson. The forest is going to fight back. It always does. We just have to do our best to minimize the casualties. 

So, for the time being, that meant focusing on something within our scope: the Houndmaster’s completely normal rat problem. 

The old farm house at the address she provided had definitely seen better days, but I have to say that even in its run-down condition, it was still impressive. It boasted a lovely wraparound porch that provided a picturesque view of the countryside. Ornate detailing around the eaves that reminded me of a fancy gingerbread house (not *that* one, though) also caught my eye. However, the house desperately needed some TLC; the eggshell exterior had chipped off after what I assumed was decades of neglect, a few of the windows were boarded up, and the lawn gave me some major Annwn-related paranoia. It had a similar energy as stumbling upon a residence below the Mounds. 

The Houndmaster's McLeod electric van was parked in the gravel driveway, along with a snow-covered Malibu. Her hounds rolled and played in the snow, not bothered by the winter chill in the slightest. 

It still feels wrong to refer to them as that, but truthfully, I’m not sure what else to call them. They didn’t appear to mind being treated like dogs or altering their psyche to be more canine. 

She opened the front door before I could knock, seemingly nonplussed to see Victor with me. The inside of the house appeared to be a construction zone. As I stepped past her, I noticed that the Houndmaster had a toolbelt around her waist, as well as a couple of bandages wrapped around her fingers. 

“Forgive the mess,” She said in her usual stiff, polite tone. “I've been so caught up in repairs that I lost track of time.”

Glancing around at the outdated, curling floral wallpaper, I replied, “Don't worry about it. Looks like a bit of a fixer-upper.”

“I wanted a project.”  

*Well, congrats, you definitely got one.*

Victor got right to the point, “Is it safe to assume that these aren't typical rats? I imagine the hounds would've been able to take care of them otherwise.”

“Correct. They aren't.” She said vaguely, crossing her arms over her chest before elaborating, “They look strange. I didn't want my hounds getting close to them, in case whatever they have is transmissible.”

*What they have?*

“‘Strange’ how?” I prodded. 

Rather than answer verbally, she strode towards the kitchen counter, then presented a mason jar to us. Within the glass was a rat. The most peculiar thing about the rodent was the numerous growths resembling lumpy, dark bone protruding from its patchy, brown fur. The worst of them jutted out from the top of its head. The poor animal looked confused. Its beady eyes were squinted, its little nose wrinkled in distress. 

*What the hell?* 

At first, I wondered if they were tumors. Rabbits have been known to develop carcinomas that resemble bone; it’s believed that this condition is what led to the myth of jackalopes. However, I began to doubt that this was the case when we all got the displeasure of witnessing the growth begin to *undulate*. A slight wriggle, as if it were trying to delve deeper into the rat's skin. The poor thing flinched as I fought the urge to grimace.

The boss gestured towards the jar, “How did you capture this one? And where did you find it?”

She told us that this particular rat had been found right there in the kitchen that morning. The unfortunate rodent had been wandering around, looking lost. It hadn’t reacted when the Houndmaster had scooped it up with a pair of salad tongs, not wanting to touch it directly for obvious reasons.

“Has it just been disoriented?” I questioned. 

The Houndmaster glanced at the clock hanging above her stove. 11:59. She set the jar down on the counter in front of all of us, saying, “Might want to get in a high place for this.”

As soon as the clock struck twelve, the rat suddenly became agitated. It squeaked loudly, scraping its little claws against the glass, whirling around in a desperate attempt to escape. Rustling could be heard from within the walls. More squeaking. More clawing. 

My hand went to the salt on my belt. The Houndmaster stiffened, but didn’t stop me or Victor as we drew a circle around the three of us. Of course, we had no way of knowing if the salt would affect these bizarre rodents, but it was worth a try.

“There are more of them.” She commented plainly. 

To which, Victor muttered, “Probably breeding and passing on whatever this shit is to their pups.” 

There was a thud from one of the other rooms, followed by another. With wide eyes, I watched as a blur of fur and hardened tumors swarmed the kitchen floor. The closer they got, the more the hagstone shook. The rodents were frenzied, their tiny squeals and scratches sounding like a jeering crowd. They steered clear of the salt circle, honing in on the trapped rat on the counter. 

The rats crawled on top of each other, their little paws grasping at the counter. They used each other as steps. All we could do was watch as the rodents formed a sentient ladder. Victor seemed just as stunned as I was. While rats are intelligent, social creatures - much more than they get credit for - this is *not* normal behavior.

Once the swarm made it onto the counter, they rushed the jar, causing it to shatter across the tiles. Now that the captured rat had been freed, they all moved in a shrieking wave back in the same direction they’d manifested from.

“Every day, at noon, they become… restless.” The Houndmaster explained, sounding tired. “Once the hour is up, they go back to being docile.”

*You couldn’t have just told us that?*

Victor clearly had the same thought as me, “Well, since we got to learn this the hard way, we’ll have to do things a bit differently than normal.”

“I felt it would be easier for you to see them for yourselves rather than try to explain it.” The Houndmaster replied coolly.

Ordinarily, when it comes to rat infestations, the protocol is to locate and seal any potential entry points that the rodents could be using. The next step is to eliminate their nests, then finally, deal with the colony directly. We had rodenticides on hand, ready to set out, but with the horde rampaging, setting everything up was going to be easier said than done.

Hold on. Above us. The other two heard it as well. Scratching. The hagstone shook even harder than before. 

“*Oh shit!*” Was all I could get out before pieces of the ceiling began to rain down on our heads.

I broke the salt circle so that the other two could get out, then sealed it again as rats began to fall from the floor above. More commotion could be heard from upstairs as some of the swarm split off. The ones trapped in the salt shied away from the substance.

That was our cue to get out of the house. Nobody wanted to find out if their bizarre growths were contagious by first-hand experience. Lab rat is not a part of my job description. 

The Houndmaster was gone in the blink of an eye. That left Vic and I to find our own escape route. There was an uproar of squeaking and skittering as the horde pursued us, moving quickly, albeit clumsily, due to the tumors in their sides. As soon as I reached the threshold, I withdrew the salt again, hurrying to draw a line to keep them contained. They funneled towards the gap between the salt and the doorframe as it closed, stopping abruptly once the line was complete. 

At the same time, Victor had circled around the house, looking for other entryways to close off. I did the same once I was finished with the front door. 

After we were reasonably convinced that the swarm couldn’t get out, we located the Houndmaster, surrounded by her hounds on the front lawn. I *still* have trouble looking at them directly without shuddering. God. 

Victor paid them no mind, all business as usual. “You said that the rampage always ends at one in the afternoon?”

“Promptly.” She confirmed. 

That meant we had almost an hour to wait until the horde calmed down again. Great. And it was as cold as the grave out there. 

She then nodded towards the road, “I suppose I should also inform you that my colleagues will be dropping by to help with repairs. Briar should be here shortly. The other one is running late.”

I couldn't help but glance at Victor at the mention of the thorny boi. He had no visible reaction. 

The Houndmaster chilled outside with her pack, sitting on a garden chair without any regard for the low temperatures. Either she is simply that dedicated towards her dogs, or she truly doesn't mind the cold. Of course, those two things aren't mutually exclusive. Meanwhile, Victor and I opted to sit in the truck with the heat on. 

I know I've bitched about the cold in almost every post since this winter began, but I truly can't stress enough how unbearable the weather has been this winter. It's been making my job even more difficult than usual, given that we deal with a lot of infestations in poorly insulated areas, not to mention all the time I have to spend in the woods to take care of atypical problems. 

While we're on the subject of the forest, Victor called his buddy from the Department of Wildlife while we were waiting on the swarm to die down. It turns out that the wildlife guys had been fighting the Avalon's construction, too. They had just been in a hearing with the development company's lawyers roughly an hour before we set off to deal with this rat problem. 

The Department of Wildlife had tried to invoke the Endangered Species Act, claiming that the construction site was interfering with the nesting habits of the rare blackpoll warbler. However, the company's attorneys argued that an inspection was done prior to preliminary construction bullshit and there was no evidence of nesting activity. After what had to have been a grueling morning for the wildlife guys, it was unfortunately concluded that the Endangered Species Act didn't apply until more documentation was provided on Wildlife's end. They were planning to bring it up at the town hall meeting. 

It's like I told yinz before: *nobody* wants this thing built for various reasons, and I would consider ancient angry forest spirits a damned good one. 

“What is up with these people?” I complained after Victor got off the phone. “Do they have a vendetta? A death wish?”

Victor, rubbing his temples again, gave me a defeated shrug, “I have no idea, but I'm over it.” 

The rest of our time passed getting status reports from our coworkers. While the boss and I were working on the rat hivemind, the others were trying to make contact with the Wood Maiden. Deirdre had taken this on as her primary responsibility in the hopes that the enraged Neighbor would be more willing to speak to her as opposed to a human or a member of the Dead Duo. As of right now, the idea is merely to talk her down from targeting those unrelated to the Avalon. 

Of course, she hasn’t been going alone, especially since the Wood Maiden used her likeness to intimidate me. Reyna and Wes have been switching off on protective duty. Unfortunately, no real progress was being made on that front. The Wood Maiden hadn't taken anyone else that we knew of, and hadn't accepted Deirdre’s attempts to communicate. 

Like Victor, I had given up any hope of reasoning with anyone on the development's side. Clearly, that was beyond their scope. 

That being said, for legal purposes, I promise I was joking when I turned to Victor and quipped, “So, when are you going to send your demon boyfriend to eat the board members?”

Victor gave me The Glare™. “He's not my boyfriend. I'm not sure what we are.”

“‘We?’” I raised my eyebrows. 

“Stop being obnoxious, you know what I mean.” He said flatly. “Also, we are at work, need I remind you.”

“Yeah, speaking of work, those rats.” I know, excellent segue. But their behavior wasn't sitting right with me. “They're way smarter than they should be. Almost like there's something else directing them.”

He nodded, “I was thinking the same thing. What tipped me off was how they dropped in above us, exploiting the limits of the salt circle. Rats are intelligent, but not *that* intelligent.”

Glad we were on the same page. We also agreed that the time was another thing that was intriguing. It was only at midday, and only then, that their behavior changed. There had to be some significance. 

Once the hour was up, we rejoined the Houndmaster. Like before, her hounds waited outside. Probably for the better. The scratching had ceased. So had the squeaking. Just as the Houndmaster had said. 

Now that things had calmed down, Victor and I could properly do our jobs. We started off with searching the rooms in the direction where the swarm had come from, which was a spare bedroom, the living room, and the basement. It was reasonable to assume that the colony’s nest was in one of those rooms. The basement was the first place I checked, since that seemed the most viable of those options. 

The first indication that my judgment was correct were the rat droppings I found around and underneath the furnace. Victor located a crack in the ventilation that reeked of excrement, along with clumps of fur. We had a winner. Getting in there to clear things out was going to be a long, arduous process. 

When we saw the rodents in their nests, once again, their behavior was all wrong. They didn't try to hide or run from us. They just sat there in a state of catatonia. There was also no sign that the rodents had chewed up anything in the vicinity, which was peculiar; rats are ordinarily destructive, nibbling on anything they think will make good nesting material. This includes wiring and insulation. 

I know I keep repeating myself, but it was so strange. I remember thinking that it was almost like the rats were on standby. At the time, I didn't realize how right I was. 

Rounding them up into traps didn't take nearly as long as it should have. They didn't run or fight. They just sat there idly. At one point, Victor and I exchanged another look. At least while the rats were aggressive, it made some sort of sense. They were still behaving like animals, albeit hostile ones. 

I also want to assure everyone that we donned masks and gloves to deal with these things. Not only is that standard PPE for this task, but we weren't sure if those tumors were contagious and neither of us wanted the dishonor of being patient zero. 

We worked as quickly as we could, not knowing if the rodents would become lucid. The Houndmaster had said that the swarming behavior only occurred at noon, but there was no way to know if that was a concrete set-in-stone rule for these infected rats. 

After we got all of the rats that we saw, we checked the area again. Not finding anything, I got to work on sealing that space off to prevent any more unwanted guests while Victor searched the rest of the house. To my chagrin, he found another nest in the spare bedroom. 

To summarize the severity of this infestation, I'll just say that if the Houndmaster decided to hunt whoever didn't disclose the rats for sport, I wouldn’t blame her. The place may be a fixer-upper, but a new paint job is one thing. A house full of rats with strange growths is a whole different level of nope. 

Between the rats and having half my body stuck in the space between walls that I was digging through, I was uneasy, to say the least. Especially since the walls in question were owned by a member of the Wild Hunt. 

I'm not sure how, but I suddenly became aware that one of the Hunters was in the room with me. There weren't any footsteps or any other noises to tip me off. The best way that I could think of to describe it is that the air had shifted. Became heavier, somehow. Maybe it's because I'm becoming more used to being around them and picking up on the inhuman subtleties in their movements, or it's another exciting aspect of the second sight. 

“What do you make of them?” The Houndmaster's voice came from near the stairs. 

While I finished caulking a crack that I'd found, I was honest with her, “To tell the truth, I've never seen anything like this before.”

“That's promising.” She replied sarcastically. Her ire didn't seem directed at me. 

*Yeah, she's definitely going to sic her hounds on whoever sold her this place.*

Even with both Vic and I working together, it took a long time to seal everything up and round up every rat we could. Afterwards, we set up some traps around the house in case there were any that we missed. We made sure to use traps that wouldn't hurt the hounds, not wanting to incur the Houndmaster's wrath. 

I've never seen her unruffled before, and I think I'd like to keep it that way. 

When I finally got done in the basement, I came upstairs to find that Briar was sitting on the floor next to where Victor was laying on his side, concentrating on his work despite the Huntsman's distracting presence. Even though he was allegedly helping the Houndmaster with repairs, he seemed more focused on the boss. It was then that I noticed thorns reaching out from a large pot filled with dirt to hold a piece of lumber up for the Houndmaster as she drilled into it. 

As I passed by with my container full of lobotomized rats in hand, Briar frowned at them without uttering a word. The Houndmaster and Victor were both too engrossed in their work to pay me any mind. I carried the rats out to the truck to set them into the cab. At the time, I'd still been pondering all the abnormalities we'd witnessed in the rats so far, so when I suddenly heard Briar's voice by my side, I jumped. 

“Surprise!” The fucker said with a smile that made me want to punch him.

As I breathed slowly in an attempt to get my heart rate back to normal, I struggled to stay polite as I asked, “Shouldn't you be helping with repairs?”

“I am. I've even got thorns searching inside the walls for more little friends. There aren't any in the attic, by the way. Gotta say, I think I might do your job better than you do.”

Growing annoyed, I said, “We're no longer accepting applications.”

The rats began to jostle in their cage. Wary, I watched them, wanting to see what they would do. Briar also went quiet. If only the silence was permanent. 

The rats appeared to be anxious rather than hostile, flinching and trying to hide underneath each other. Slowly, I glanced at the Huntsman by my side. His brow was furrowed in concentration, seeming to be staring past the cage. 

“Did you find something?” I asked, momentarily pushing my irritation to the wayside. 

Rather than answer, Briar turned abruptly to hurry back inside. Surprisingly, he allowed me to keep up with him enough to follow him to the upstairs bedroom. 

The Houndmaster and Victor were already there when we arrived; she was in the hallway outside the door, watching as he used a knife to pry up one of the floorboards. He asked the Houndmaster if she still had the tongs she used to grab that one rodent. She retrieved the tool, handing it to him as she waited for him to reveal what he'd found. 

It was a tarnished silver locket. The charm that would ordinarily contain a picture was sealed shut by a substance that looked similar to what was growing out of the rats. 

Unexpectedly, Victor asked me, “How does the locket look to you?”

Confused and apprehensive, I gave him the same description as I did above. Afterwards, he pensively informed me that he couldn't see the growths on the necklace. To him, it was just a regular, old and somewhat dirty locket. 

It hadn't even occurred to me that he wouldn't be able to see the jewelry‘s anomalous quality. Deirdre keeps assuring me that it'll get easier. I wish that moment would come sooner. 

The locket shuddered. The tumors covering it squirmed, moving to cover the locket's hinge. 

“It doesn't want us to open it.” I told Victor as he rose to his feet, still keeping the cursed necklace trapped firmly in the tongs. 

“Do it outside,” The Houndmaster ordered us firmly. “I've got enough repairs to deal with, and the last thing I need is a fight to put more holes in these walls.”

*Not our fault you bought a former crack house.*

Regardless, Victor and I obliged. Meanwhile, Briar seemed much more invested in our task as opposed to doing what he actually came there to do. 

“It's not a loose soul,” He mused, accompanying us out the front door as the Houndmaster went back to what she was doing prior to the locket's discovery. “But it has similar qualities.”

Over his shoulder, Victor asked, “What do you mean?” 

Briar's explanation didn't clear anything up. “It's all fragmented. Like a remix. Or maybe a regurgitation would be a better descriptor.”

The macabre image of chunks of a human being assembled like stained glass haunted me after Briar's latter suggestion, for some reason. 

Victor kept the locket at arm's length as it swayed from the tongs. Once we were outside, rattling from within the truck became audible. The rats. 

*What now?*

Upon investigation, they were all scrambling over each other, paws grasping towards it while tracking the locket with their gazes. They gravitated to the corner of the container closest to where the boss was walking past, following his movements like little furry magnets.

“Hey, boss?” I called to Vic. “The rats are losing their shit.”

“Bring them out here!” He shouted back. “I want to see something.”

Curious, I plucked the cage up, glancing between the locket and the trapped rodents as I rejoined him. They appeared to be desperate, forming a clump together as they strained against the container. The closer I got to the locket, the more agitated the rodents became. 

While we were doing this, the thorny boi was supervising. He perched on the hood of his old yellow boat of a car, scrutinizing our method with his arms folded across his chest. 

I thought back to what Briar said. A fragmented mess of what remained of a soul. What were we in for?

While the rats continued to squeal and squirm restlessly, causing the cage to rock violently in my grasp, Victor and I stared at each other. He appeared to be just as unsure about this as I was. 

I cocked an eyebrow, asking uneasily, “So, do we think it would be bad or good to put these two things together?” 

While Victor gauged the rats' reaction to him pulling the locket away, Briar called from where he was sitting, “Fuck around and find out!”

Take a guess what face Victor made at him. “Shouldn't you be *inside*?”

“Nah, I'm good here! The thorns got it covered!”

Their lovers’ quarrel got interrupted as the cage lurched in my hand. The rodents were becoming more and more frantic with each passing second. Before doing anything else, I set the cage down on the ground, then encircled it with salt, leaving only a little gap that would be easy to close. 

“This is a terrible idea.” Victor said gruffly. 

I nodded. “Yeah, but the last thing I need is another debt hanging over me.”

“I know.” He sighed. “Let's fuck around and find out, I guess.”

With that, Victor tossed the necklace into the circle. I didn't waste any time closing it. Good thing, too. The cage burst open shortly afterwards. Both of us reflexively ducked away. Stray shards of metal flew across the yard like shrapnel. Vic got a piece stuck in his leg. Shards hit my arms painfully as they guarded my face, but by some miracle, nothing broke the skin.

When I looked up, I saw the rats’ pelts *melting,* forming a mosaic of flesh and disheveled fur. The locket stayed at the top of the amalgamation as it began to take shape. Two legs, the right longer than the left. One arm that ended in a jagged stump at the elbow, the other halted at the shoulder. A neck with no head. The locket dangled from it. Almost humanoid, but like it didn't have enough material to get there. Little beady eyes, taken from the poor rats, dented its raw skin like pockmarks alongside the tumors jutting out of its torso. 

Raspy gurgles erupted from the rat-being's exposed trachea. The stench of wet fur, rat excrement, and fresh meat all blended together was potent enough even with the distance between us to make me gag. It limped towards the salt circle, letting out an enraged hiss when it couldn't move forward anymore. 

I hadn't seen Briar move before he suddenly appeared by the boss' side. Before I could say or do anything, Victor ordered me to get the lighter fluid. He didn't have to tell me twice. Whatever that thing was, I did *not* want to get near it, not even with Ratcatcher, as ironic as that statement is. 

The lighter fluid was in the back from when Wes and I dealt with the Hunger Grass, along with the matches. While salt is a fantastic tool, I have to say that a little arson can go a long way as well; it can kill almost anything, including me. Don't tell anyone, though. It's my only weakness and I don't want to get fired. (Pun intended. I am not sorry.)

While Briar examined the metal stuck in Victor's leg, I raced back with the supplies, thankful that we'd had the foresight to set a salt trap. It would've gone worse if that pest had been able to reach us, or *way* worse if it had escaped. 

The pest was trying to reach for Victor and Briar, recoiling each time a fraction of an arm neared the salt circle. The eyes in its chest flicked towards me as I approached, the pest scampering backwards in a twitchy, rodentlike motion. Dousing it with lighter fluid consisted of me running around the circle comically, trying to get the pest covered enough to burn it. It took longer than I care to admit and probably looked ridiculous. 

After I was sweating from the exertion, I finally got enough of it covered before lighting a match and throwing it into the circle. As the flames licked at the amalgamation, steadily traveling up its limbs and billowing like the leaves of a great tree in autumn, the pest's garbled grunts became louder. The closest it could manage to a scream through the exposed vocal cords, I imagine. 

The metal around its neck glowed, hotter and hotter as the inferno continued. *Shit!* The salt had melted in spots. It began to lumber after me. 

*Fuckfuckfuck!*

A gunshot. Victor had gotten the shotgun, stocked with salt shells. The pest flinched, but continued to charge me. I could feel the heat even through the distance between us as I booked it.

I hadn't wanted to get close enough to slash at it before. Now, it would be impossible without catching fire myself. 

Suffice to say, Vic and I fucked up. It happens, especially when it comes to dealing with new, never-before-seen pests. 

Just as I was losing ground, an unexpected savior emerged. Thorns the diameter of fire hoses erupted from the snowy ground, sizzling as they seized the burning pest. I couldn't tear my eyes away as the vines effortlessly ripped its half formed limbs from their sockets, forming sharp cocoons around each part that they extracted. More and more coiled around it until it wasn't visible anymore. Occasional glimpses through the thorns revealed that only a pulpy mass remained of it. 

It had only taken seconds for it to be over. The smell was unbearable. Burnt flesh and fur. 

*Don't tell me we owe the thorny boi, now, too.*

I turned to check on the boss, catching a brief glimpse of him and Briar by the side of the truck. 

*Oh.* 

Thinking it would be best to give them their privacy, I ventured inside. It would probably be good to let the Houndmaster know about the rats anyway. 

When I plodded into her foyer to announce that the job was complete, she was fully invested in her work, her eyes drifting towards me for roughly half a second as she replied, “I appreciate your haste in handling this manner. I consider your debt to me paid in full.”

Cool. Good. One less thing to worry about. 

By the time that I got the nerve to head back towards the truck, Briar had finished removing the metal shard that had impaled Victor's leg.

What else did yinz think I was giving them privacy for? 

Briar was on one knee, examining the injury further. Victor sat on the truck’s floor as the Huntsman sneered, “That's, what? Three times I've helped you today, leader of Orion?” 

“Just two,” Victor replied curtly. “I know that counting is hard, but do try to keep up.”

Without looking up from his work, Briar raised a hand to flip the V at him. 

“Yes, that many.” Victor was choosing violence. 

The Hunter snorted, which turned into a snicker with a shake of his head. Victor actually gave him a small smile in return. Come to think of it, the only people I've seen be able to clap back at Briar without having to run for their lives afterwards are Iolo, the Houndmaster, and the boss. 

*Not your boyfriend, huh?*

Once Briar had determined that Victor's wound was closing normally, that was our cue to leave. The boss was unusually glowy when we got back to the truck. I have to say, it's kind of nice to see him like that, even if the Neighbor responsible for his good mood is a bit of a jackass. 

Personally, I was anxious to see Deirdre after the grotesqueness of this misadventure. All I wanted to do was curl up under a blanket with her, a bowl of popcorn, and a bad horror movie. 

She's really cute when we watch them, by the way. When we get to the scary parts, she tucks her legs up and hides behind her hands, peeking between her fingers. I've told her we can switch to something else, but she keeps suggesting watching them, so she must not hate them *that* much. That, and I think she likes an excuse to occasionally bury her face in my shoulder when her hands don't make a good enough hiding place. 

To tell the truth, I don't have any updates when it comes to her condition other than that her shadow looks less watery, if that makes sense. It's more solid. That bird silhouette hasn't been back, either. We're still not sure what that's about. 

I can't help but wonder about Deirdre’s premonitions, though. Maybe that bird is the one delivering them to [her.](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/SO6b77lmMD)
