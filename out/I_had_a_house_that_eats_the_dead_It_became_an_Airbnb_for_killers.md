I was still processing the implications of [Pamela's letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/114ckwe/i_had_a_house_that_eats_the_dead_i_wasnt_the/), but now I had a more pressing concern: with Aaron gone, money quickly became an issue. Looking over my finances, the banker was incredulous that I’d ever gotten a mortgage. After all, I was just a single mom with no discernable income.

“My advice?” he told me. “Either sell that house or start renting out rooms. Otherwise, this bank will end up auctioning it to the highest bidder.”

The house had a spare bedroom with an ensuite bathroom on the ground floor near the back. It was fairly separate from the rest of the living quarters. I figured it would be easy enough to rent out for a few nights at a time. I had a locked door installed in the connecting hallway, such that the room was completely isolated from the rest of the residence.

Then, I simply put up a listing with a price that seemed obscenely high. I was fully booked within hours.

Maybe I’d been naive, thinking that the house had a new energy now, one that would attract the right kind of people. I couldn’t have been more wrong.

The first guest claimed to be a dentist in town for a convention, but nothing added up. First, I’d never seen a dentist with dirty fingernails before. Second, his suitcase stunk like death, though he’d clearly doused whatever was inside with a generous spritz of bad cologne.

Within five seconds of meeting him, I was reconsidering the entire enterprise. As I handed him the keys to the back unit, he couldn’t take my eyes off my chest.

“What a lovely sweater,” he said softly. “Real wool. You can always tell the real thing.”

It was one of the few pieces of clothing the house hadn’t eaten.

“Thanks,” I said, trying to drop the key in his hand without touching him. “Enjoy your stay.”

“Oh, I’m sure I will,” he said. “The house is a true specimen. A true specimen indeed.”

The man took his time settling into his room. I couldn’t see what he was up to, but I could certainly here him knocking around. Occasionally, he laughed out of nowhere. I hoped he was on the phone to a funny friend, but it seemed more likely he was lost in thought, contemplating something dark. I wondered how it would feel to go to sleep that night, knowing he shared a roof with my children.

Then, around dinner time, the man left. I waited until his car pulled away and then entered his room. Of course, I knew I shouldn’t, but I couldn’t resist. Strangely, he hadn’t unpacked at all. The bed was still made, even the toilet paper was still neatly folded with a triangle at the end. The only evidence that he was there at all was his suitcase sitting unopened on the folding luggage rack.

At that point, I figured I’d come that far. I had to know what was inside. Quick as I could, I strode over to the suitcase and opened it. I gagged as it sprung open, the odor of death washing over me. I had become so used to the house’s unnatural cleanliness, that the suitcase’s contents hit me harder than I could have expected:

Inside were dead animals, all crammed together like melted marshmallows, filling every square inch of the suitcase. No breed or species had been ignored. I saw a small dog, a squirrel, a dead lizard, even a possum.

This wasn’t the work of some careful taxidermist. The animals were still bloody, some crawling with maggots. Others were so rotted that they almost seemed to blur together with their neighbors, making it impossible to tell where one ended and the next began.

“You’re not eating them,” I whispered to the house. “Why? Trying to avoid revealing yourself to him?”

The house didn’t answer. I didn’t have to. I could sense its fear.

I’m not sure how long I stood there looking at the mess, but at some point, I heard keys jangling at the exterior door. Perhaps he’d forgotten something.

I closed the suitcase as quick as I could, hurrying to reset the clasps. Panic surged through me as I imagined other suitcases, filled with me, with Derek, with Grace, our bodies severed and mingled like the animals.

Finally, I got the clasp back in place.

Just as the exterior door opened, I speedwalked back to inside door of the main house and quietly closed it behind me. I was breathing so hard by that point I thought I was going to pass out. As I reached the living room, I bumped into Grace, who looked at me with scared eyes.

“Is there a bad man staying with us?” she asked.

“Yes,” I answered.

“Are you going to make him go away?”

I put my head in my hands. “I don’t know.”

That night, the man’s snores filled the house. They were almost inhumanly loud, as if a hibernating bear had taken up residence downstairs.

After I put the kids to sleep, I stepped out onto the front porch. For the first time in almost a decade, I craved cigarettes. There on the porch sat Pamela’s urn. I still hadn’t mustered the courage to bring it inside the house. Maybe I never would. After making Carter disappear, I’d promised myself I’d never feed it another person.

Of course, I’d already broken that promise once.

“What am I supposed to do?” I asked the urn. “Grab a knife from the kitchen. Sneak into his room and stab it in his throat. What if I miss? Is it my job to erase every creep who sleeps here?”

The urn said nothing. I lingered for a while there, watching the clear, uncaring stars. Then I went to sleep.

The next morning, I awoke to the sound of screaming. Out on the street, my neighbor Roopa was standing over some kind of bloody carcass in the street. When I ran out to her, a chill ran through me. It was her beloved calico cat, Otto, minus his head.

“Who would do this?” she asked through tears. “What kind of person would do this?”

“When did this happen?” I asked.

She shook her head. “It must have been early this morning. I didn’t let him out until at least midnight.”

I managed to hold in my sobs until I reached the house, but I broke the minute I walked inside. Derek was right there, and he ran up, throwing his arms around me.

“What happened?” he asked. “What happened?”

“I need you and Claire to go stay with Aunt Amy for a little while,” I said. “Everything will be okay. But there’s something I need to take care of.”

A few hours later, I saw the man walking to his car. His suitcase seemed just a little bit heavier as he wheeled it to his car. He gave me a small wave.

“How did you enjoy your stay?” I asked quietly.

“Oh, better than I could have imagined,” he said. “I’ll certainly be telling all of my friends and acquaintances about it.”

For a second, I turned, ready to retreat, to let him leave. But something in me couldn’t let that happen.

“One last thing,” I said after a few seconds. “We should do a final walkthrough together. Just to make sure there were no damages–or anything that would incur an additional cleaning fee.”

“Is that part of the regular procedure?” he asked, curious.

“I can do it myself if you like,” I said. “If you’re eager to get on the road, that is.”

The man took one more look at the house and smiled.

“I wouldn’t mind a few more minutes inside,” he said.

An hour later, I sat on the stairs to the basement, watching the hot spot devour the last of the man’s body. Next to him lay his obscene suitcase, now licked free of its contents. The next time I saw Roopa, she’d have no recollection Otto had ever existed. The same was true for the rest of the pets’ owners. I hoped that was a kindness.

The man hadn’t put up much of a fight, ultimately. I’d asked him to bend down to examine an imaginary stain. Then I’d plunged a kitchen knife in his back. I hadn’t hesitated for a moment. It had been easy.

Perhaps Pamela’s letter had inspired me. And maybe that had been the point all along. Some people needed to be put down, erased. Maybe that’s why places like this house existed. Maybe death wasn’t enough for the worst people in the world.

Pamela had done enough now. I saw that. She had sent the letter and set me on my course. And if she, too, wanted to join the erased, who was I to stop her?

Before I could reconsider, I grabbed her ashes from the front porch and took them inside, fling them all through the house. The glittered in the air like falling snow, disappearing before they even hit the floor, slurped into the gray void that was the house’s stomach.

And for the first time, I saw the house for what it truly was. Not evil unto itself at all, but a vortex for evil, a wasp trap filled with some kind of irresistible nectar.

All it had ever needed was some kind of poison inside.

And as I watched the last of Pamela’s ashes fade into nothing, I knew I would never let another evil man leave my house alive again.
