We were high school sweethearts. All flustered and infatuated with eachother. Normal for a couple who were in their very first relationship. However, this incident has made be rethink everything that has happened, before my girlfriend died. 


Daisy was her name. Fitting for someone like her. Full of innocence and joy. 

She spoke with elegance and kindness. She had strawberry blonde hair, going up to her shoulders, and it was a little wavy at the ends of it. I used to tease her over it. 

Daisy had a large family. 1 sibling and a horde of extended family relatives. I was very close with her family, actually. She had a sister, named Marigold, who usually accompanied us on the many dates we would have. 

Unlike Daisy, however, Marigold was the complete opposite of her. Marigold was rude and snooty, and usually was very moody. Marigold was bipolar. Changed moods a lot. It was annoying, up until a certain point. Then I realized something. Something critical, and important. 


You see, a few days before Daisy's death, Marigold went into an episode. She ended up harming her sister during it. My beloved girlfriend was hurt. Her family were being defensive towards Marigold, saying that she couldn't control it, and that it wasn't her fault. But I was beyond angry. I felt numb inside, as I had constant anxiety over whether she would survive or not.


I lived in an area known for its bustling nightlife and clubs. So it was normal to me to casually see a few drunks around causing trouble to anyone and everyone they can spot. I was in a park, and it was around 11PM when I started to see something unusual. It was just in the corner of my eye, but obscured by the many trees and wildlife around it. Then, I saw it. 

It was a humanoid figure. The figure appearance was horrifying. It had no skin or fat, just muscles. The muscles were protruding and were constantly relaxing and tensing up, with a squelching sound every second. 

The figure started to walk towards me. I froze in place, as my thoughts started to race and confirm whether it was real, or of I was just hallucinating it. I started to dart my eyes towards the other people in the park, who were simply unfazed by this monster. 


"I have a deal for you." It started to speak, its mouth squelching and squeezing at every syllable it could say. I was speechless. I could only watch its body tower over me, standing there intimidatingly. 

"What are you?" I said, fear filling my body. 

"My deal is simple. I'll grant you anything you want, but for-" 

I cut him off. "I decline your offer." 

The figure stared at me with its bloodshot eyes, staring me down with pure anger. Adrenaline fuels me as I started to run away, never looking back. 


Daisy died the day after this specific incident. I was with her as she breathed her last breath. Overcome with grief, I left her bedside, and decided to take a stroll in the same park, reliving our precious memories together and wondering what I had done to deserve this. I was just pondering over my thoughts, when I saw a familiar face. 



The figure was sitting down, cross legged. As it spotted me, it said something I could never forget.Â  



"Don't disobey me again."
