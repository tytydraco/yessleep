It was not my intention to go through the door, but you see a door in the middle of your family's land, and you think, sure, why not? But I am getting ahead of myself, let me explain a thing or two so you understand what led me to the door.

  
I am by no means an interesting person, unless you think a gay gamer nerd who works a corporate job in a small town is "interesting". Do not misunderstand, I love my life. My dog Jasper keeps me company while I sit at my computer and play whatever game I am obsessed with. Right now, it is Wizard101 (Yeah, people still play it). However, I would be lying if I did not say that nothing "exciting" really happens to me. 



That was.... until the door. 



My apartment does not have any laundry hookups, so I do my laundry once a week at my grandparent's house in the middle of nowhere. I also tend to do puzzles and listen to D&D podcasts while I wait for the clothes to finish. Like I said, nerd. This also gives my aforementioned dog Jasper a chance to run around unhindered by a leash or my watchful eye, though he does sit at the window and whine for attention. 

 I should also mention that when I was younger, I would walk around my grandparents' land all the time, playing games of magic and storytelling that could possibly make a pretty good fantasy series if I do say so myself. I say this to add that the place has always had a mystical feel to it. There are woods there, fields for the cows to graze, and even tanks (it is a body of water, bigger than a pond, smaller than a lake, usually manmade). Beyond mystical though, it was always *tense*, like when you run your finger over a zit that is just ready to be popped. Just one small nudge or tear and it is over. 

That is what the door did.

  
We drove up to the house on a Sunday after a particularly brutal week of work. Annoying coworkers, difficult clients, etc. etc. The weather was alright, pretty mild in general, grandma was going to one of the many great-grandchildren's ball games and so it was just me, Jasper, and probably my depression. I was getting along with the puzzle and Jasper was just whining and whining for attention when I had the unnerving feeling of being watched. We always said that the house was haunted, either by family members or some random ghost, we did not know. But it made me want to get out of the house.

So, here I am, currently walking through the woods, Jasper by my side, exploring that which I have not in probably five or six years. You always feel like you are being watched in these woods though, like a higher being or entity was ready to smite you or an axe murderer would get you for fun. The trees wove in such a way that you could not see the end of the trees but they were not thick enough that you could not see the open pastures beyond. There was a fire a few years ago that got rid of all the brush, so the stomping around was pretty easy. 

  
I had been wandering for about thirty or so minutes when the hair on the back of my neck stood up and the area around me was still and quiet. Not a natural silence either. Or, if I were to compare it to a natural silence, it would be that moment before a thunderstorm begins or that early foggy mornings where you do not know if the world ended and you are the last one left. 

With that feeling I froze in place not sure of my next move. Never in my life had I felt my nerve endings this raw and primal, ready to get me the F\*\*\* out of the area at the first break.  That break actually came from Jasper who started growling. Whoever is reading this, it may not seem unusual for a dog to growl during this situation, but for Jasper, it is horrifying. He is a calm medium-sized Australian Shepered. Case-in-point, we were on a run the other day and a dog two to three times his size comes charging at us barking. The owner is yelling, there is a mom across the street telling her kids to stay on the porch, and my friend is getting between this dog and Jasper. But what is Jasper doing? Nothing. He just chilling minding his own business sniffing some grass wondering why we aren't running. So, when I tell you he started growling and had all the makings of an attack dog, I was scared. 

I broke the tension of the air before anything else could and darted out of the wooded area into what my family calls the "new ground". We had bought it after the original tract of land my grandparents settled on so that is what us kids called it. Though, maybe it had that name long before my family ever came into contact with it. 

Jasper was on my heels as I broke through the brush, there was some newly grown thorns tearing at me but I did not care, one thing I learned growing up here, never let your guard down in the woods. The sweat was building on my neck and shoulders as we made it to the field. While the weather was starting to turn cold, the grass was starting to die, but still it was tall enough to conceal whatever had created the tension. 

Frantically I looked around, Jasper going crazy trying to get my attention as I tried to locate whatever was triggering both mine and Jasper's feral survival instincts. But, as soon as we were both ready to fight to our dying breath, it stopped. The world decided we were not important anymore and the tension dissipated like a breath after being underwater for a little bit. I nervously laughed as Jasper went back to his docile state, looking at me for pets. 

I crouched down and satisfied his need for pets. I got a little lost in his eyes for a second though, one full blue and the other brown with a quater of it blue like the other. And I am a firm believer that while the guy has a very derpy face, he knows more then he lets on behind those eyes. 

As I stood up though I froze in my tracks as I looked beyond our little pocket into the rest of the New Ground, where a door had appeared. 

I have walked these field since I was five or six and never has there been a door. It was a nice door, sat on the far end of the field next to a very old tree that honestly was probably dead and just had not decided to fall. Sticking it to God or something. As I looked closer though I realized the tree was what was holding it up, and that roots were snaking through the edges of the door and ingraining themselves with the old tree. 

Curiosity got the best of me and I walked towards the door. Jasper got the hint and followed close, either to protect me or to be clingy, I know not. The air was tensing again, or maybe it was just me. I do not know really. I looked around waiting for someone to pop out but it was just me, my dog, a tree, and a door. As I got to the door I realized that it was my size and the roots sprouting from it were *new*. And not like, oh they grew over a few years new, they were growing as I watched it, pulsing with some energy that I felt was not entirely on an axis of existence I was aware of. I felt Jasper tense as well as I looked around the tree, nothing special other than a random door appearing. 

The sun had been shining when I began exploring the area, but now the clouds rolled in, gray and heavy with emotion, quickly blotting out the sun. The wind picked up, adding to the crescendo of nerves. My adrenaline was already on edge, so it was only magnified as I waited for my next move.

I said at the beginning of this, it was not my plan to open the door, I mean honestly you only see that in movies. However, as I stood there, waiting for the zit to pop, the door opened, and inside was.... *nothing.* Now, reader, I do not mean it was a room with nothing in it or just dark, it was nothing. I could feel the lack of atoms, the lack of matter, the lack of existence from beyond the door. And I knew that it was not supposed to be here. Or, if it was, humans were not supposed to know about it. 

While I sat trying to calm my heartbeat and turn to leave, it hit me that I had not truly breathed in ages, causing me to take quick inhale of air. Apparently this was enough to scare Jasper who darted forward. Before I could grab him he crossed the door line and just... disappeared. One second was my little fluffball and the next he was nothing and the door slammed shut. 

The weird thing though was that moments after he disappeared I could feel his memory draining from my mind. I have had Jasper for almost a year now but could not remember where I got him. 

The memories of how he would sit in a chair next to me while I gamed were losing color and form, disappearing into the nothingness that was the door. The depressive nights where I held him close and cuddled with me through the pain, started to fade like a printer running out of ink. 

Or how when he wanted attention or needed to go outside he would spin and yip at me until I went over and rubbed his head, causing him to lean into my hand, his soft fur bringing me out of whatever stupor I had been in. 

I could feel the tear on my face as Jasper slowly slipped from my reality. And, as I slowly lost my best friend, I saw that the roots were  growing even more viscous, growing and humming with energy that could only be the bond between a man and his dog. And, the sadness I felt was replaced with rage. How dare this random door steal my dog away from me for its own gain, leaving me with the hole I had in my life that Jasper had filled so long ago.

Like I said, I had all intentions of not going through that door. But, if you are a dog owner, you know that I could not let that door have those memories. Without Jasper, my current self would be lost, and that was something I could not allow. It could not have my dog. Not now. Not ever.

So, with a shaky step, I approached the door and, without a thought, knocked softly. The door creaked open, sounding almost like a stomach growling for food, and I did what any "sane" person would do, I stepped through.

If you are reading this, I do not know how it got here, but maybe it can be a tether to my world, my reality, my *axis*. I know that my life right now may not be exciting, and could be considered *bland.* But I can feel that palpable air of change, that while I may not be where I want to be, I am where I need to be. And I know that wherever I *need* to be, Jasper has to be right there by my side. Let's just hope that the door closing behind me doesn't sever this connection.
