*“Tom?!”* my mother shouted as she cleaned the kitchen after dinner.

“What?” I shouted in reply. *“What?!”*

She often did this. She would shout for me or my sister and then deliberately not say anything, so that we had to go find her.

“Yes?” I huffed, standing in the kitchen doorway a moment later.

She gestured at the green waste bin, flinging soap suds in its general direction. “Can you take the food waste out to the compost, love?”

I rolled my eyes. *“Sure…”* I sighed.

“Thanks poppet,” she whistled, humming along to the radio.

I grabbed the bin by the handles and heaved. Its contents *stank.* Wrinkling my nose, I hauled it through the door and up the stone steps to the garden. Outside, it was dead quiet. We lived in a quiet neighbourhood, but it was almost preternaturally still tonight. There was barely even a breeze. The sky too was crystal clear.

We kept the compost at the top, near the back wall, the streetlamp beyond which throwing a bilious trickle of amber light across the garden, discolouring everything. This light often kept me up as I had thin curtains, but I was grateful for it in moments such as these as it meant I never needed to juggle a torch along with also.

Staggering under its weight, I dropped the bin as soon as I reached the composters and felt suddenly, inexplicably alone; a thought which made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. Occasionally, I’d watch something scary before bed and then be coerced into some chore or other in the garden, inevitably giving myself the heebie-jeebies as I wandered about in the dark, but this felt different.

I felt afraid.

Shaking it off, I reached for the fork and tossed the compost briefly, but not as much as I should’ve done. Something was nagging me, gnawing at my senses. All of a sudden, I was overwhelmed by the feeling that I *shouldn’t* turn around.

The shadows around me intensified.

Then I heard it.

*Hrr-Hrrr-Hrrr…*

A man’s laugh. Dreadful. Slow.

I was still holding the fork, but I could feel my hands shaking, my legs starting to quiver.

Fear, like a white-hot current, pulsed up and down my spine - to the point that I felt faint.

Rejecting the impulse of every nerve, every sinew, I willed myself to turn round.

There, crouched atop the old wall was the silhouette of a man in a hat, ringed with orange light. I could see almost nothing of him - just a window of smooth, uneven facial skin and his bright, shining eyes - but he radiated pure malevolence, pure violence…

*Hrr-Hrr-Hrr…*

I felt like I was going to vomit. Like I was trapped in a nightmare.

*I couldn’t move.*

He grinned at me slowly.

I heard a scream.

Everything went black.

\*

I woke up screaming.

A few minutes later, when I eventually came to my senses, I realised both parents were watching me. They were sat nervously, perched uncomfortably on chairs they’d brought upstairs from the dining room.

I felt the weight of my Dad’s hands on my shoulders.

“What’s wrong?” he asked worriedly. “Tell us what happened, son.”

I shook my head. Like knives flashing across my mind’s eye, pictures of the man on the wall assaulted my vision. I began to shake violently.

“The compost… I was, taking the bin out and there was…there was…”

I began rocking back and forth, tears trickling down my cheeks.

“It’s okay,” my mother soothed, “you’re safe now.”

I nodded, but still the words wouldn’t come. I wouldn’t let them come. I didn’t want to breathe any more life into that horrible thing I’d seen.

“You’re safe, son,” my father repeated.

Gulping, I tried again. “There was a…a man, watching me. On the back wall.”

As soon as I’d uttered those words, I felt my father’s body language change - like he could suddenly relax. I watched as he looked over at my mum, sharing a sort of sly wink.

*“I’m not fucking kidding!!”* I exploded, suddenly angry. *Why were they not taking this more seriously?*

“No, no, of course not,” my mother consoled, “but it was probably just some drunk from the local pub…”

*“It was not just some fucking drunk from the local pub!”*

“Don’t talk to your mother like that,” my father warned.

I crossed my arms in disgust, wishing that they would both just disappear.

But then I took a deep breath.

This was important. They needed to know the truth. *We weren’t safe.*

*He could still be out there…*

“The man. He was tall, slim. He was wearing mostly black, I think, and he had smooth skin on his face. Weirdly smooth. And…”

“And?” my father interrupted annoyingly.

“...*and,* I think he was…I think he was wearing a…*top hat.”*

Here, I expected my parents to laugh, but neither did. They looked at one another gravely.

“You’re sure?” my father asked.

“Yeah, pretty sure. But it was dark, I guess…” I added, suddenly unsure of myself.

“Go lock the doors, Mag,” my father told my mother. “Make sure Jinny’s okay.”

“D-Dad?” I mumbled, feeling the fear start to bubble up again.

“It’s a long story…” he began, his gaze turning inward. “Every town has its urban legends. *Its boogeyman.* Ours is no different… Growing up," he grimaced, "people used to tell stories about a mad hatter. *A murderer.* *A ghost.* A ghost we called *the Top Hat Man…”*
