"Put this on my death row list," my wife Kelly liked to say whenever we'd have a particularly delicious meal.

It could have been nothing more than the Animal Style off the secret menu at In-n-Out that we had when visiting her sister in California.

I don't think it's an uncommon phrase or sentiment to say such a thing. It's cultural shorthand for something so delicious that you'd choose it as your final meal.

When this happened, I was in the business of final meals as the warden at the state prison in Buckton.

You might have read about what happened in the papers. This incident put The Buck on the map, but not in a good way.

I suppose this will serve as my confession. You see, what was in the news isn't the whole story, and it sure as shit isn't the true story.

This is.

The first person to ever be executed in what would become the state of Maine was a lady by the name of Mrs. Cornish back in 1644. She'd come up from Massachusetts - and most Mainers today would consider that a black mark enough on her record to affirm a sentence of death.

*We, the jury, find the defendant guilty by reason of tailgating and clogging up Route 1 in their asshole Audis, your honor. Fry 'em.*

Now, the way I understand it - or at least the men who write history have recorded it - is that Goodwife Cornish liked to sleep around. I don't mean to sound like I'm slut shaming, as the kids say nowadays. But if we're talking context of the times, there wasn't much worse a woman could do than to step out on her husband, what with all the Puritanism that was in the air.

When Mister Cornish had the misfortune of turning up in the river with dozens of stab wounds and his head stoved in from blunt force trauma, Mrs. Cornish was arrested for it. They said the motive for the killing was that he had discovered her affairs.

To test Mrs. Cornish's guilt, the authorities conducted what is known as Trial By Touch. If the accused touches the body of the deceased and the corpse begins to bleed, well then, you're guilty. That's just good science. Unfortunately for Mrs. Cornish, the late Mr. Cornish's body is said to have bled when she touched it, and the Goodwife was hung up high on a too-short rope down in York County shortly thereafter.

That might sound like bullshit, but you'll have to remember we were predating the Salem Witch Trials by a good half-century here, so it wasn't exactly an age of reason.

The death penalty in Maine went away in 1887 because of a botched hanging. I don't need to tell you which direction the winds of change have been blowing these past few years, and it won't be a surprise for you to learn that capital punishment made its triumphant return.

I didn't have strong feelings either way about the matter. At the time, I was one of the three deputy wardens, and we were involved with more day-to-day operations in the prison and less on the administrative side. I was paying more attention to who shanked who in the laundry than anything that was going on at the State House in Augusta.

But then Warden Hayes had a widowmaker heart attack driving down the Turnpike, and his Buick veered across the median and crashed with an oncoming semi-truck in the northbound lane. He'd have been dead a second time if the heart attack hadn't got him, and the doctors assured Ellen Hayes that it would have.

I had the most seniority among the deputies, so it was my position for the taking. At that point, Skunk had been at The Buck for nearly three years when the Warden passed. I inherited the job, a shit ton of paperwork, and the first execution in Maine since the Gilded Age.

Jefferson Davis Langone III – or as his friends and enemies called him, "Skunk" was born and raised in Brooklin. Don't confuse that with Brooklyn as in New York or Brookline down in Massachusetts.

Brooklin is an idyllic little spot tucked down on the coast, hard by Blue Hill and Deer Isle. Growing up there hadn't done much for Skunk in the way of a peaceable outlook on life. Not that any of that was his fault. From what I could glean from the newspaper reporting that followed in the wake of his crimes, he had been highly intelligent but with no affinity for schooling. Skunk lived with his eight siblings and parents on a saltwater farm.

That's a spot of land that hugs right up along the ocean, using seawater to feed crops. The most famous association with that practice is E.B. White, which has led to generations of writers romanticizing the practice.

But there's nothing romantic about it. It's a hard life. A rogue wave during a storm can flood your fields and kill your crops. And who wants to head out to milk the cow when the gales of January come early? By all accounts, Jefferson Davis Langone II – Skunk's father – was a hard man.

So, it doesn't come as much of a surprise that Skunk turned out the way he did. I’m certain that very few inmates I've encountered grew up in stable and loving homes. Skunk had a rap sheet a mile long before he really got down to business.

That business was killing his ex-girlfriend and then setting fire to her apartment to try and make it look like an accident. The fire spread, and before all was said and done, four other people in the building had died.

The jury was out for a whole ten minutes when they returned with a conviction on all charges under penalty of death by lethal injection. One of the local rags ran "SKUNKED!" as a headline.

Our one-man death row was converted office space just above the plate shop. And yes, the guests of the governor are still making the vanity plates for your Volvo, even in this era of automobile automation.

Before becoming the big boss, I never had occasion to speak with Skunk. But as the new face of the operation, I thought it was a good idea to sit down with him to hear him out if he had any complaints.

So every few months I would go in to see him. Part of it was performative on my part because it's not the fifties anymore. Warden Hayes was from the old school, and we needed a change. I've found that treating prisoners like human beings can reduce recidivism once they're back out on the streets.

You may call that soft since we're dealing with convicted criminals—some of them violent—but I've seen how the revolving door works. Frequent flyers was the term we used.

In Skunk Langone's case, there would be no potential for future crimes. He had a one-way ticket. But I sat down with him in the visiting area once a month. Our visits lasted barely two minutes and always went the same way.

I’d ask him how the guards were treating him, and he just nodded and said, "Good," without making eye contact. I'd tell him if he needed anything, just let the head guard, Tommy Marks, know, and I'd see what I could do. Within reason, of course.

On our last visit a month ago, I got up to leave, thinking that the next time I spoke to him would probably just be before his execution.

As I headed for the door and nodded for the guards to bring him back to his cell, Skunk called out to me. "Hey," he'd said.

I stopped and turned around, meeting his coal-black eyes. This is where you need to understand something about the inner workings of a prison. Inside, there are no secrets.

When Paul Butler and I were guards on C block and he got tuned up by his brother on Thanksgiving and showed up to work on Monday with a black eye, every inmate knew what had happened. Why? Because of the simple fact that guards are incorrigible gossips, and that includes with their charges.

It's a form of currency. You tell Mr. 6-8 on an armed robbery bid that so-and-so got popped for a DUI or that someone's wife is stepping out on him; he's not going to give you as much trouble. Because that gives him power over the other screws. So, what Skunk said to me didn't surprise me in the least.

"Sorry about your wife, Warden," he said. And he sounded like he meant it.

\*\*\*

The last meal for death row inmates varies by state. Most placed a budget on it – forty bucks seems to be the average. Good luck having a side of potatoes if you're partial to a sixteen-ounce porterhouse before you shuffle off your mortal coil.

Some jurisdictions require the food to be locally sourced, which seems tonally inconsistent with capital punishment. *We're committed to best practices from farm-to-execution table.*

Some will allow you a beer. Others have been granted the privilege of dining with a fellow condemned inmate. A warden in Louisiana shared a meal with the condemned and even went so far as to pay for a lobster dinner out of his own pocket.

Even before Skunk made his request, I decided I would operate with a similar amount of latitude. I was at a low point.

A month before the execution date, just after Skunk's last-minute appeal had been turned down, my wife Kelly left me. And \*left\* is doing an awful amount of heavy lifting here. Kelly sent me a text message and said we were through. She said that she didn't want to see me again and that I shouldn't come looking for her. She drained half the money from our checking account and disappeared.

We'd had problems, but I didn't think they were any more serious than anyone else's after twenty years together. In my line of work, I know a lot of cops. I asked a couple if they could help me track her down, and they kinda shrugged and said she was an adult and had every right to disappear. The evidence was right there in front of me.

I didn't take any time off, only started working eighteen-hour days instead of the usual twelve. So when Skunk's request reached my desk, I guess I felt a bit…needed. Or needy. Your wife takes a walk, and you think, well, I'm not worth a shit.

On top of that, Skunk's execution had been weighing on me. I hadn't sentenced the man. Hadn't heard his appeal, and I wouldn't be administering the lethal dose of chemicals to him. I wasn't the governor who had already rejected Skunk's appeal. But I still felt like somehow Skunk's death would be on my hands.

I'm not a bleeding heart, which you might have guessed, especially given my line of work. But here was this guy – and he wasn't a good guy by any measure. But I was about to oversee his death, and he had a straightforward request – he wanted a world-class meal.

Now Portland, Maine, is foodie heaven. I'm a meat and potatoes guy for the most part, even more so after Kelly left. But there's something called the James Beard Awards, which, from what I can gather, are the Oscars for restaurants. And Portland has had a disproportionate number of eateries make the list over the past fifteen or so years, given its population.

I mulled over Skunk's request, realizing the cost would be more than the fifty dollars the folks up in Augusta had designated for these occasions. I was wifeless and childless, owned my house outright, and had a fully vested pension upon retirement. I had enough to get by.

I sent word that Skunk should make a list of potential restaurants. I didn't tell anyone that I planned on making up the difference out of pocket. No one needed to know.

A couple days later, Tommy Marks told me that Skunk wanted to meet with me about the meal. So I shuffled up to death row and found Skunk sitting in the visitor's room, his shackled hands on the metal table.

I gave him a nod and sat down in the chair across from him.

"How you doing, Skunk?" I asked. "I'm dying," he said, and I saw a twinkle in his eyes that hadn't been there the last time I spoke to him. Maybe it was acceptance as to his fate.

I managed a smile for his line but got around to the matter at hand. "I hear you wanted to ask me something," I said.

He inhaled, let it out, and the words began to tumble from his mouth. "You know. Somebody like me," Skunk started, and I could tell he'd been running this over in his head.

"Somebody like me, I come from nothing. Never had nothing either, once I was older. Every mistake a man made in life, well I made it. Never got joy from nothing. I never even had cable. So when I come here, and you see all these channels? It's like a different world. You know what I mean? HGTV? The classic movie channel. What I like the most, it's the cooking shows. You know, to see the preparation? It's like…I don't know anything about art. But it feels like art. Maybe it's because my idea of going out to eat is McDonald's. But in here, I dream. I dream about food. That's all I dream about. Good fucking meals, you know?"

I put up my hand to stop him. "I don't mean to interrupt your soliloquy, Skunk. But I already told you, it's all good. From wherever you want. It's yours."

"And I appreciate that, Warden, I do," he said. "But I want someone to come here and prepare a meal for me down in the kitchen. Like a real, proper four-course meal."

I tilted my head back and looked at the drop ceiling and fluorescent light above me. I suppose my body language betrayed my concern with the request. I exhaled through my nostrils.

"I can't bring somebody in here -"I started, then realized it was even more complicated than that –

"Nobody is going to want to come in here," I said. I saw Skunk's face fall. "I mean no offense, but..."

I threw out my hands as if to say *you realize this is death row, right?*

"What if I had somebody? He asked, "Somebody willing to do it? Gratis. No cost to you or anyone else."

I arched an eyebrow. "You've got a chef that's willing to do this? Already?"

He nodded, his head bobbing up and down like it was on hydraulics. "I'm telling you. This woman. I read her interview after she won the Beard for Best New Restaurant. She's a real bleeding heart. Ten percent of net proceeds go to some charity or another, fucking homeless endangered spider monkeys, I dunno. But there's no way she's pro-capital punishment. I don't mean to stereotype, but Google her."

"Who?" I asked because I didn't have any idea who we were talking about.

"Christina Boullet," he said.

I'd reached out to Christina via the contact on the site for Back Cove, which humbly labeled itself as \*inspired molecular gastronomic takes on classic fare.\* Whatever the fuck that meant.

When I got home to the empty house, she'd already responded with a polite "thanks but no thanks." I could break the news to Skunk in the morning and maybe offer some fresh Maine lobster as a substitute.

But I never did get to tell him that Christina had declined because when I got to the office, my phone rang, and the caller ID said Back Cove. Christina said she slept on it and had reconsidered.

"That's great," I said, "I'm sure he'll appreciate it."

"So when can I expect you in?" she said, and I laughed. It came across as impolite, but it was out of shock.

"Oh, I'm sorry – it can't – you'd have to come here." There was silence on the other end of the line.

"I'm sorry," she said, her voice lower now, "I can only cook here. I don't even cook in my condo."

"I understand," I replied, though I really didn't. I mean, conceptually, I did. But I didn't get it. It was some artistic headspace she needed to be in, touchy-feely bullshit. And if there was one thing I didn't get, it was touchy-feely bullshit.

Kelly would have told you that. If there had been a sticking point in our marriage, it was that one. Mike Campbell was not in touch with his feelings. Sure, I'd bring roses on anniversaries and shed the requisite tears at a funeral. But I'm not a Modern Man.

I thanked Christina again before hanging up. I still didn't tell Skunk because I didn't want to disappoint him. \*Your final request before I pump you full of chemicals is denied, my good sir.\*

When I got home that night, it was my turn to sleep on it. I tossed and turned, and every time I was about to doze off, I could hear Skunk's cries, the ones that had yet to escape his lungs. The ones that I imagined he would emit as we led him down the hall to meet his maker.

Shortly after 4:00 a.m., I got up, made coffee, and began to formulate a plan.

\*\*\*

The Board of American Prisons recommends a 3 to 1 prisoner-to-guard ratio. That is, for every three prisoners, there should be one guard on duty. Since we only had Skunk and I didn't have any one-thirds of a person handy for staffing, we overachieved with a 1 to 1 ratio on our death row block.

If Skunk needed to be moved to the yard or somewhere else in the facility, the guard on duty would radio down, and a floater from the main blocks would come up and assist, just for safety purposes.

But in Skunk's time, he'd never so much as looked at any of the guards cross-eyed. It was a cushy detail. There was a TV, and if you had the overnight shift, you could snooze on the couch in the office. Time and a half shift differential and your sleep rhythms don't get all fucked up like most overnight workers.

Skunk had seen the outside of the prison over the past few years only for trips to court for his appeals hearings and once when we thought he was dying, but he just needed an emergency appendectomy.

Maybe it was the guilt of what I was about to do to him or what I'd done to Kelly to make her leave. It was probably a little bit of both.

I stopped by Back Cove before they opened that afternoon. One of the front-of-the-house staff directed me back toward her office when I told her I was from the state, which wasn't a lie. She was sitting behind a desk, looking just like the picture on the restaurant's website—blue hair, a nose ring, a ring in her lip, gauges in her ears.

Like Skunk, I don't mean to stereotype, but she looked the part. If she knew who I was, she didn't betray it. "I'm Mike," I said, "from…" I jerked my head in some vague direction as if that would indicate where I was from.

But she understood right away. She stood, we shook hands, then told me to sit in the chair across from her.

"Second thoughts?" she asked. I nodded slightly as if admitting that out loud to anyone would mean serious trouble.

For a moment, I didn't say anything, and neither did she. I studied her, considering what I was about to do. And what I was about to do, at a minimum, could get me fired. At worst, I could end up alongside my inmates, which I'm sure a few of them would have loved.

But I was fresh out of giving a fuck, so I said the thing I shouldn't have:

"Can you keep this quiet?"

\*\*\*

On the afternoon of Skunk's last supper, I told Paul Butler that he could go home early to beat the snowstorm that was set to dump a good foot of snow on the region. "I think I should be here the last night, give him his meal. The priest from St. Anthony's is coming over after that. You head home," I said, hoping I didn't sound like I was hiding something.

Paul nodded but looked unsure. I realized what the issue was – "You'll still get paid your differential," I said, and his head bobbed up and down like a nutcracker on speed. Rule number one of warden'ing is you never get in the way of a screw and his extra pay.

"Thanks, boss, thanks," he said, grabbing his cooler and heading for the door. He stopped and eyed the greasy Wendy’s bag I was holding in my hand.

“That for him?” he asked. I nodded.

“Thought he was going fancy?” he said.

I shrugged. “Changed his mind.”

Paul chuckled. “Fucking moron.” Then he left.

When he was gone, I walked down the hall to Skunk's cell. He was dead asleep on his cot, which I found positively mystifying. Forget about the fact that he was going to be executed tomorrow; the man was, in a few hours, going to take his last breaths outdoors. To feel the cold of the winter crackle in his lungs a final time.

He was going to dine as a free man, or as much of a free man as I would allow him to be – and here he was, sawing wood. We had a few hours, so I went back to the couch in the office and tried to sleep.

This resulted in me fucking around on my phone, checking the forecast, and thinking about what I was about to do.

A half-dozen times, I almost called Christina and told her to forget about it. She had promised that since it was a Monday, the restaurant would be closed, and she would be the only person in the place. Not that it mattered since we would be arriving in the dead of night.

But could a person really be trusted to keep this kind of secret? Maybe. She didn’t seem to be doing this for any reason other than that she was against the death penalty.

 Either way, I was committed to fulfilling Skunk’s request, consequences be damned. Maybe it was some latent guilt from twelve years of Catholic schooling. Or not so much the guilt but that this was to be an act of forgiveness on my part.

Not that I was some high and mighty entity, but merely displaying some measure of humanity toward an evil man would say something about…something. I don’t know. Maybe I just wanted to feel.

 At 11:00 I checked the closed circuit camera and saw that Skunk was awake and using the electric razor to trim down his stubble. I took a garment bag off the hook on the door and walked down to his cell.

 At the door, I opened the slot and placed the bag inside. The squeak of the hinges on the slot made Skunk turn back and he saw the garment bag sitting on the tray on his side of the door.

 His eyes fell on it. Inside was the suit he had requested to wear for his execution. But tonight, he was going to wear it for dinner.

 Our eyes locked through the eight-by-eight security glass window and we both held our gaze. I think we were both realizing that this was actually going to happen, and maybe neither of us could believe it.

 After a moment I snapped out of it.

“Fifteen minutes,” I said.

 Back in the office I opened up a cabinet that controlled the surveillance cameras for our block. The one in Skunk’s cell. The visiting area. The hallway. I clicked them all off. For good measure I turned off the one in the stairwell that led down to the sallyport where my truck was parked.

There was video coverage there as well, but it wasn’t controlled from here. It didn’t matter because I’d parked my truck so that a camera wouldn’t catch us coming out of the stairwell.

 After the cameras were off I threw on my coat. I looked at the handcuffs on the desk and took a deep breath.  

\*\*\*

My Silverado pickup was an extended cab, but I didn’t make Skunk ride in the back. He sat in the passenger seat, handcuffed hands behind his back.

 His hair, long and streaked with gray was slicked back. The off the rack suit was a bit too short in the arms but otherwise he looked like your uncle dressed up for a cousin-in-law’s wedding.

 Never mind that Skunk would probably burn the place to the ground, cooking the bride and groom and all the guests to a crisp.

 We drove in silence, the snow coming in horizontally toward the windshield, appearing as if we were making the jump to hyperspace.

 Even with the truck the roads were slick. I was going slow but at one point hit a patch of ice, felt my tires spin before the slip differential kicked in.

 "Radio?" I asked and Shrunk grunted which didn't provide me any guidance so I left it off.

 He took this as an invitation to speak, I guess. "How much they saying?" he asked, as if we were just a couple fellas down the corner store shooting the shit about the weather.

 \*Sayin' it's gonna be a corker, eh, bub?\*

\* Yessah, just picking up some milk and bread for Mutha.\*

 "Foot and a half inland. Maybe fifteen down this way."

 "Huh," he replied and I'm not sure if he was impressed. We resumed our silence.

 Soon, the lights of Portland appeared, reflected off the cloud cover.

 I got off 295 just north of the city. There were two cop cars at the bottom of the ramp dealing with a car that had slid into a ditch.

 I gripped the wheel tight, had visions of sliding off the road myself with Skunk in the passenger seat. "Oh him, officer? Just the guy who's going to be executed tomorrow. No big deal."

 We eased past them and Back Cove was just up on the left in an old mill building. Christina had told me to pull around the back and park by the dumpster.

 I saw her Hyundai hatchback there and I slid in next to it. Or at least, I assumed it was hers, what with the NO FARMS NO FOOD and “It will be a great day when our schools get all the money they need and the Air Force has to hold a bake sale to buy a bomber” bumper stickers.

 I went around to the driver's side to open the door. Skunk slid out, his boat shoes sinking into the snow. He gave a slight huh of bemusement, like he was Dorothy stepping into Oz for the first time.

 In the back doorway, I saw Christina standing in the shadows waiting for us. I led Skunk toward her and she held the door.

 "Welcome," she said as if we were a couple of walk-ins off the street looking for a table. But you couldn't walk into Back Cove. They had a lottery system to get a table and it booked six months out.

 On the rubber matt inside, Skunk and I both stomped our feet to shake off the snow. Christina locked the door behind us.

 She slipped between us and held out her hand.

 "This way," she said and slipped around a corner. We followed, me with a hand at the small of Skunk's back. We went through the kitchen which had blinding fluorescent lights.

 "This is where the magic happens," Christina called back over her shoulder. Through the kitchen door we stepped into the darkened restaurant.

 The walls were exposed brick and decorated with eclectic abstract art. The dark wood tables were all bare, save for one in the center of the rest that was draped in a stark white tablecloth with two place settings. In the center of the table there were two candles.

 I pulled out a chair for Skunk and he slid down in it. I looked at his cuffed hands behind his back.

 "I take these off, you're not going to give me any trouble, are ya Skunk?" I asked. I'd thought about this as it had been one of the possible sticking points for the whole operation. Skunk was a violent bastard but he was a hundred and forty pounds soaking wet.

 If he decided he'd like to make a run at me, I was fairly sure I'd tangled with bigger and badder dudes when I was a guard. Besides, he'd never once tried anything with any of the guys who were assigned to death row. Would he really use this opportunity to get cute? I didn't think it was likely.

 So I slid the key into the cuffs and unlocked them. Skunk rubbed his wrists and I went to take the seat across from him, which Christina had slid out for me.

 I plopped down and thanked her. I placed the cuffs on table and Christina tensed.

 "I'm sorry, but can you put those out of sight? It's just a little...corporal for my tastes," she said.

 "Oh, sorry," I said apologetically and slid them into my jacket pocket.

 "Can I get you anything to drink?" she asked.

 “Sober for five years, might as well keep the streak intact,” Skunk said and it was the first time he sounded almost wistful.

My three beers a night had been another consistent point of contention with Kelly and it was a habit I’d never kicked when we were together. I hadn’t had a drop since she left, so I figured I’d keep my own more recent streak going.

 “I’m driving,” I said.

After a couple of minutes, Christina brought the first course out, setting a plate in front of each of us.

 My nose involuntarily wrinkled and Christina saw it.

 "I'm sorry, I’ve never done this before -" I stammered, trying to apologize.

 Christina wasn't flustered either way.

 "Oysters and pearls," she incanted, "Butter-poached oysters with a sabayon featuring tapioca pearls and caviar."

 I'd never had caviar and the black little beads looked like the mouse droppings I found in the attic each spring. I could take or leave oysters, had never been a particularly big fan of the briny flavor or the sand that crunched in your teeth.

 But Skunk's eyes were like saucers as Christina headed back toward the kitchen. He picked up a spoon and scooped up some of the broth. He brought it to his lips, closing his eyes, savoring it.

I figured I would never have a meal of this quality again so I picked up my own spoon. I only got the tiniest bit of caviar along with some of the oyster and a tapioca bead. I brought the spoon slowly to my mouth and the flavor exploded there.

 "Holy shit," I said, and it was the best thing I'd ever tasted.

 Skunk chuckled, seemingly delighted at how much I liked it.

 "Life changing, isn’t it?" he said and I had to agree.

 Hell, I almost said "put it on my death row list," as Kelly used to, but remembered my bedside manner.

 I greedily went in for more, but Skunk took his time and I can't say that I blamed it. Maybe he'd manage to choke down some eggs for breakfast the following morning, but I couldn't imagine he'd have much of an appetite. So you might as well go out like this.

 Christina returned to find both of our plates empty. She looked at me.

 "Was everything to your liking?"

 "It was...incredible," I said and that was the truth.

 "Good. There's more," she said and took our plates.

 "Salad," Skunk said just before Christina returned with two plates.

She set them in front of us and this time I didn't turn up my nose even when she said "Warm chicken liver with escarole and frisee salad."

I grabbed for the bigger fork at the left side of my plate but Skunk said "uh uh" as he reached for the smaller fork. "Salad," he said lifting it in the air.

I grabbed the smaller one and dug in. Then I swore to myself I’d never eat Iceberg with ranch again.

As we waited for our main course, we both did our best to avoid eye contact, because there was nothing for us to talk about, save for the guillotine that was looming over Skunk’s head.

After what seemed like an endless silence, Skunk cleared his throat.

 “Just want to thank you for this,” he said, “’bout the only nice thing anybody ever did for me.”

 “I’m sorry, Skunk,” I said, “Sorry that’s how it’s been for you.”

 He shrugged. “All over but the dying part now, I guess,” he said as Christina appeared from the back.

The main course was Pork Jowl Boudin with Black Trumpet Mushroom Crust, celery root, and a bordelaise sauce. If Skunk was going to hell in 24 hours, he was certainly in heaven right then. And so was I. 

Jowl, as you might have surmised is just a fancier way of saying pork cheek. The flavor of this one broke my brain and Skunk and I sat there grinning at each other like a couple of idiots. I knew I shouldn’t be doing this, knew I certainly shouldn’t have been enjoying the experience as much as I was.

The man sitting across from me was a cold blooded killer and here I was reveling in this meal with him. What should have been solemn and quick had turned to a decadent, drawn out affair.

I checked my watch and it was after midnight. We needed to speed this along so I could get Skunk back to his cell before anyone noticed.

“Wonder what’s for dessert?” I asked.

 “An apple,” Skunk said, “She always ends with that.”

That seemed curious to me. Was it baked?

 On cue, Christina appeared with a tray topped with a silver domed cover.

I thought of the crème brulee that Kelly and I had served at our wedding, which prior to this had been the fanciest dessert I’d ever had. I thought those little flamethrowers that made the top of it crust over were just about the coolest things.

Christina set the tray down between us. From beneath it I heard something, muffled and garbled. It sounded like…a voice.

I wanted to reach for the cover to take it off, but suddenly realized that I couldn’t lift my arms or any other part of my body, save for my eyes.

 I was paralyzed.
