The lock was broken. I could see it from the driveway. I picked up my glock from the glovebox. I wasn't scared-- thrilled, I guess I was. I had waited long for this to happen. I unlocked the door and made my way up the driveway.

As I pushed the already slightly ajar door wide open, my grip on the gun tightened; my breath became constant and-- I am not ashamed of admitting it-- the smile on my face grew wider.

It was a considerably small house, a kitchenette cum dining room straight ahead with a small living room on the left with a staircase on the right. I had no backyard and therefore had no need for a backdoor.

I reached the door to my living room. I perked my ears trying to catch any trace of my prey. No luck. I quickly spurned into the room and levelled my glock. Alas... Something else caught my eyes. It was the lack of chaos in the room. I was expecting the room to be in a ramshackle affair. I wondered-- did he start from my bedroom upstairs?

I made a quick search of my dining room. Expectedly empty. The climax of my hunt was nearing. I could feel it. I made sure my steps were  inaudible. I paused on the final step leading to my upstairs bedroom. "This is it", I thought. Every American homeowner has wet dreams about a day such as this. I rushed in without a second thought.
-----------------------------
I felt Rage. Pure, unadulterated rage. Disappointment aswell-- as I found everything in pristine condition with no sign of an intruder ever stepping foot inside. 

Any sane man might have felt relief. But not I. My Hopes were dashed to the ground. I could not help but imagine the sheer fear in his eyes if I had caught him. His lifeless eyes featured a lot on my mind aswell. "Some other day", I mumbled.

I let a long sigh out. I realised I had to report this to the authorities. I put down my phone on the counter and went out-- it was nearly dead. I went downstairs, got my replacement lock from the living room and went out. Making sure to lock the door this time.

The police did not appreciate the situation. They found it unbelievable that my house was broken into but nothing was amiss. Nonetheless, they promised to send a plain-clothesman to keep an eye on my house for the next couple days. I was a tinge bit disappointed-- it meant that the man could keep an eye on me aswell.

I didn't compain, much. The drive home was uneventful, though I could not shake off a foreboding feeling. I turned on the radio but it could not help me. It felt as if every other driver was looking at me. Through me. It felt as if they knew what I wanted to do.

I got home, barely avoiding a crash. Thankfully, my hands stopped shaking as I reached my home. I immediately took a swig of tequila from the fridge. Finding an urgent need to distract myself, I decided to go ahead and play some Warzone. I made my way upstairs to my computer. It was heavily budgeted, but it got the job done anyways. I was about to fire up the launcher when it suddenly struck me. I never checked the CCTV footage.

I cursed under my breath, got up and got my phone from the bedside table. Once connected to the computer, I looked up the file for today. I saw myself going out with a grumpy look at 7:23 am and then nothing for a long time. I fast forwarded and stopped at 2:57 pm. There he was. My escaped prey. It started out normally enough. He took about a minute and half to pick my lock. But then, just before entering, he pulled off his balaclava and looked up straight into the  camera.

Looked is the wrong word. Stared is better. It felt as if he didn't stare at the camera, but at me. Through me. Seeing myself for who I truly am. Mocking me. Mocking my pathetic desire for murder. I finally realised I hadn't breathed in a long time when he finally went in.

 I fast forwarded again and saw myself pulling up the driveway, get my gun from the glovebox and tip-toe my way in with the gun aimed at 5:13pm and then go out again at 5:25, and come back again at 6:47. I ran the footage right up till the present live footage.

 I closed the application decidedly unnerved. With an unsettled feeling, I got the Warzone launcher back up. 
It was in the middle of a particularly boring match when I finally realised the reason for the sinking feeling in my stomach. 

While I did see him break in at 2:57 pm;

I never saw him leave.
