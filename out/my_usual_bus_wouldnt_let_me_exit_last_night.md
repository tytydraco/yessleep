Basically what the title says. I live in a really big city in Germany, but more on the outskirts of town, since housing is cheaper there and my parents were actually able to afford a house that came with a big garden. Most apartments uptown are really expensive and me and my sister would have to share a room, so I’m pretty happy with how things are. The only disadvantage is the way of getting around and to school. We have one tram and one bus line. 

If I want to get to school, it takes me 40 minutes, nerves of steel (since you can’t rely on German trains) and I have to change trains several times. My school,as well as most of my friends, are right in the city center. On my way to school one of the trains crosses a bridge over the river and sometimes I use those two minutes that I can see over the city, to switch between looking back at where I live and looking out front, where the train is going, to visualise the distance. 

Basically, what I’m trying to say is, that when I visit my friends in winter (I take the bike in summer, though it takes almost a full hour, to avoid the pressing heat of German trains that mostly come without a functioning AC) and I’m taking the multiple trains and busses back home at the end of the evening, I’m often the sole passenger. Very rarely I’m joined by a few familiar faces (at some point you recognise those living in the area since it’s basically like living in a village with the forest on one side and the river on the other, the latter sectioning us from most of the rest of the city) who work in the city and get back home late at night. 

Usually, that’s the case with the tram. The busses are mostly empty, since they take longer and most people prefer the train over the swaying drive through narrow streets with a stop coming up every few hundred meters. 

I prefer the bus though, since I have to walk quite a bit from the tram station back to my house, which, as a girl walking at night, isn’t my preferred option whatsoever. It has happened before that I got back home from friends and was greeted by drunken men, sitting on the pavement, drinking beer and calling me over. So no thanks. 

The bus stops twice, at the beginning and the end of my street. With my house being right in the middle of the street, it’s the better option for me. If it’s late and I’m drowsy, I can even miss my stop and get out the next one, and I have to walk the same distance. 

It’s currently the end of January and the sun usually sets around 4-5 pm, my curfew around this time of year is 10 pm. Me and my friend group had spent the afternoon together, sitting around the table and yapping at each other, when I realised the time (around 9:20). Knowing I’d be late, I called my dad to inform him. He wasn’t particularly happy and offered to come pick me up, but I declined, knowing he takes his sleep very religiously. 

I told him I’d be fine and reminded him of the karate classes I had when I was eleven, which didn’t calm him down, but the idea of having to get out of bed and drive 20 minutes to come pick up his useless teenage daughter didn’t seem to amaze him either, so he reluctantly agreed to let me take public transport alone. I’m always the first one to leave meet-ups, so I took advantage of being late anyways and took extra long to get my stuff. I left my friends apartment at around 9:50. 

After punching through the stuffed metro (it was a Friday as well, so people where using their “Feierabend” to go knock themselves out in some club with friends and coworkers), and squeezing myself in an overflowing train, which basically spit me onto the train station as I got out again, the cold air of January was a well welcomed gift. I now was left between taking the tram back home or the bus. 

The bus would’ve arrived 5 minutes later than the tram, but I needed to cool down anyway and the option of walking the kilometre from the tram station to my house came with the possibility of coming across a few drunks leaving the local pub. So I sat down at the bus station and watched a tram coming from my quarter of town driving by in the direction of the city, packed with people looking for a fun night out. 

When it arrived, I was one of three people sitting down inside the warm and stuffy bus. I haven’t been inside many buses outside of Germany, so I don’t know if the smell inside is universal, so I’m going to describe it. It smells a bit as if hot gasoline spilled onto plastic and the fumes had creeped into the soft cover of the seats. It smells of sweaty armpits (even in winter), dead skin, old people and old cars. It smells warm and suffocating and if you get carsick easily, then the smell is guaranteed to be a catalyst. 

Luckily, I’m used to it by now and after noting it shortly, I’m able to ignore the smell of generations of sweaty passengers blazing under the summer heat in the rolling tuna can, sweat dripping on the cushions, being rubbed in by the next sweaty passengers sweaty ass. I swear to god some people have never even entered the aisle in the store where they sell deodorants. 

I looked for the least disgusting seat (sometimes you never know what those dark stains actually are and I’m convinced the seats are only patterned as some sort of camouflage for all the dirt) and sat down at the window. 

With U2 blasting through my headphones and the street lamps passing by in a blur, I did the thing where you pretend to be in a movie. After around 20 minutes of possibly the most boring film scene ever, I pressed the stop button and a jingle calling through the bus let the driver know that the next stop was mine. By then, I was the only passenger left inside the bus. Sometimes I wonder if at some point in the future they will discontinue the bus line, since it seems like a waste of fuel. 

As I imagined what it would be like driving the bus, chauffeuring around empty seats and possibly a jacket left behind late at night, I noticed that we weren’t slowing down, even though my stop was coming up at the end of the street. Wondering if I’d hallucinated pressing the button, I pressed again. This time, I was left without a jingle. 

After aggressively pressing several times, I got up to try another button. After reaching the third button, and pressing it down hard, the bus took the corner into my street at full speed and I grabbed the edge of the seat, barely avoiding crashing into another. My arm hurt at the sudden pull of my whole body weight. Helpless, I stood in the middle of the bus, pressing the stupid buttons over and over. 

You’re probably asking yourself why my first cause of action wasn’t to go up to the front and talk to the driver, and obviously the thought had already crossed my mind. 

But you see, one of my biggest fears is talking to strangers. I avoid it any time I can, especially when I need to ask for help. I wasn’t able to go to the store alone until I was around 14 or 15, because I was scared of talking to the cashier. I’d always take my younger sister with me, who used to get angry with me for being so socially incompetent. I can’t talk to teachers properly, I’ve never made a friend because I went up to them but instead I got adopted by all the friend groups I’ve ever been a part of. 

Asking the bus driver to stop would basically mean correcting him or telling him he’d done a mistake and everything inside me turned inside out at the thought of an old grumpy man shouting at me because I told him how to do his job. I know that sounds stupid, but that’s just the way my brain works and I can’t help it. But eventually I realised, that it would be my only option. Maybe the driver hadn’t seen me because we were separated by his drivers cabin. Maybe he’d turned off the systems, because he thought the bus might be empty. 

Admittedly, that just sounds stupid, but what else was supposed to have happened. While I still stood in the bus aisle, trying to gather up the courage to walk up front and talk to the driver, I felt the bus hit a familiarly shaky part of the road. I looked out of the dirty window, just as we passed my house. I recognised it although it was dark outside and almost all the lights were turned off. My sisters window faces the street and her pink curtains glowed in the dark. She probably still sat over one of her art projects. 

That short moment of seeing the peace and comfort of my home gave me enough courage to walk up front. Grabbing support bars left and right as the bus rumbled over the neglected street covered in holes, where me and my sister used to put little paper boats in when it rained and they turned into small oceans, I planned out my words. 

“Uhmm, sorry, sir, excuse me, I need to get-“, I said to the empty chair. 
 
I stopped dead in my tracks, both hands holding on to something on each side to not fall and break my neck. 

“What the fuck?” 

The steering wheel was turning seemingly at random, all on its own. The bus was going straight, but the wheel had a slight drift to the left, which didn’t seem to bother the rest of the vehicle. 

“Uhm…” 

Dumbfounded I stared at it, as it took a sharp turn to the right, but the bus went on as always. Down the street, I could see the next stop approaching. 

“Uh, hello?”, I called out, not sure how to proceed. 

I don’t know if I expected the driver to suddenly reappear again or what I was trying to accomplish, but obviously nothing happened. I stared at the dimly glowing green numbers next to the steering wheel, telling the time. 10:47 pm. 

Suddenly, there was something right at my neck, hovering just over my skin. It was the primal instinct of being watched. My shoulders tensed and even though it was fairly warm in the bus, a shiver ran over my whole body, down to my feet. Too scared to move, I slightly tilted my head to look at the surveillance camera on the ceiling. I could almost feel it looking back. 

As the bus rushed past the next stop and its warmly lit bus shelter, I was thrown out of my stupor. Not looking behind me, I rushed to the drivers seat and grabbed the wheel, or at least tried to. But no matter how many times I tried, my hands wouldn’t reach it. It was like trying to walk up to a rainbow, where it moves away with every step. It was definitely there, but I just couldn’t reach it. 

My mouth fell open to hatch a breath. I tasted it before I smelled it. I tasted dead skin cells and gasoline and years worth of sweat and plastic and the air was so warm, that it almost seemed as if I was breathing in an animal. I immediately closed my mouth as the smell intensified, but the taste lingered on my tongue and made it feel hairy. 

I tried covering my nose while still trying to reach for the steering while, my feet helplessly searching the breaks but only finding air, and as the bus took the next corner, I slid out of the drivers seat and crashed onto the floor, my hands meeting with the wet dirt of shoes brought in by late passengers, my only proof that there in had been people inside the bus prior. I didn’t dare to turn around, still fearing something lunging at me if I did so. 

The adrenaline numbed my muscles and I didn’t notice the pain in my arm anymore, that I had tugged moments earlier. My head spun as I got up, nothing seemed clear anymore, the walls were caving in but miles away, I couldn’t reach for the seats and the old streets under the wheels made standing difficult, I was thrown around, trying to keep my balance at the inside speed the bus was going now, how were we not hitting anything, how was in not hitting anything? How could I stop this nightmare, I caught a glimpse of the surveillance camera and now I knew it was looking at me, but it was just sitting there as my vision blurred. Something started to drip, maybe the windows, but it all just looked so wrong. 

Finally, I got hold of the edge of a seat. I was laying down on the floor inside the boiling dirt, the rigid smell of old gasoline entered my ears and nose and clouded my brain. I didn’t move. There were sounds coming from the engine, it was screaming silently but I didn’t understand. My nails felt weird as if there was something between them and the bare flesh of my fingers and my bones seemed to distance themselves from me. 

I heaved myself up, my body at least five times as heavy as usual. I was driven by adrenaline, and I was at the end of the bus, no at the front, no underneath the seats, I was looking down at me and I was looking out from behind my eyeballs. I fell forward and hit something, I heard a jingle and then a door slowly opened. 

The icy wind hit my skin, cooling down the sweat an dirt as the bus carelessly rushed through the streets. With the inside of the bus being distorted, the outside looked as always. The dashboard bubbled up to my face and the time display showed 10:62 pm, nothing that was possible. I was in a daze, almost unconscious, still trying to reach for the wheel. 

The bus screeched around a corner and I hit the pavement. The adrenaline covered to pain of the impact and the backlights of the bus vanished in the distance. 

I sucked in breaths of cool air as the rancid smell of the bus seemed to drip out of my ears onto the concrete. I didn’t even try to get up to the nearest bush as I rolled onto my side and let vomit spill out of my mouth. I didn’t dare to move. I just lay there and waited until I regained feeling of my body. Then, after an ungodly amount of time, I dragged myself home. 

I still don’t know how I got there, how I opened the front door and stumbled into my room. But I won’t ever enter a bus again, ever.
