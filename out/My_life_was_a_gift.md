I don’t know who to turn to. At this point, I’m not what’s real anymore.  

Let me start at the beginning.

A few years ago, my life wasn’t going well. I was in debt and about to become homeless. I was at my wits end and felt like I was about to do something stupid.

One day I felt compelled to check my bank account. I don’t know why. I was well aware that my account was well into the minus. Amazingly when I checked my account, I had over a grand. I didn’t know where it came from and I didn’t care. I know you’re supposed to report stuff this but with the situation I was in, you can understand why I didn’t.

A few days later, I checked my account again. Over ten grand now sat in my account. I didn’t know who my mysterious benefactor was and I was too happy to care.

This went on for a few months and eventually I had millions. I had a big house in a gated community and a few cars I had always wanted. Life was good and it was about to get better.

Even though I was very wealthy, I still wasn’t very social. Sure I went to a bar a few times and bought rounds for everyone but honestly who wouldn’t.

I was at a fancy lounge one night. I was out on the balcony looking out over the city, wondering if my luck would last. That’s when I met her. That’s the night I met Lilith. She was absolutely gorgeous. Hair as black as night and wearing a black sequin gown. Probably the best dressed in the place. She came and stood next to me at the balcony railing and we hit it off immediately. It was like she appeared from nowhere and wasn’t even interested in the party and just wanted to talk to me. Which, knowing what I know now, is most likely true.

For a few years Lilith and I lived together happily. She was perfect. She liked all the things I liked. Same food, movies, music, hobbies… everything. Honestly it got boring sometimes. You need challenged in life. Having someone agree with you constantly is dull. 

We got on great. She met some of my family and they got along too. I wanted to meet her family but she just said she wasn’t in contact with them anymore. I decided not to press her on it cause I figured it was a sensitive subject.

The years went on. The Money kept coming and Lilith was pregnant.

I was the happiest I had ever been.

I went crazy with decorating the babies room and buying everything we would need. I even bought a new SUV to put a car seat in. A sports car exactly fit for an infant.

When it came to baby names, it was the only time we disagreed. We found out it was going to be a boy and started thinking about names. I wanted to name him after my Grandfather, however she wasn’t moved. Every time we talked about it, she was firm. The boy’s name would be Raziel.

I figured it was because she was very goth-ish. I kind of liked it truth be told.

The time came. We went to the hospital and were sat in the maternity ward. 
After a long, exhausting night, in my arms I held my own flesh and blood. My son.
Raziel.


The night after the birth, I was sitting next to Lilith’s hospital bed, holding Raziel. I sat there looking at the two most important things in my life. I knew I would do anything for them. I felt like the luckiest man on earth.

That’s when it happened.
The event that has shaken everything I believe to be real.

The nurse finished checking on Lilith and left the room. 
Just as she left, the hallway lights turned off. The light in the room began to flicker and Lilith began smiling at me while giving me a ‘Kubrick’ stare. I was too unnerved to even ask her what she was doing.

I looked over to the door. A black mist began to form on the floor within the darkness of the hallway.  I can’t describe exactly what I felt when I saw this. It was like I was extremely hot but extremely cold at the same time. My head and chest felt heavy.
Out of the mist stepped a man in a sleek black suit. The mist enveloped him as he moved toward me. He walked slowly into the room and towards the chair opposite me. It felt like an eternity between each of his footsteps which seemed weightless but somehow shook the floor.
He sat across from me and stared me down with his bright amber coloured eyes.

Between the stranger and Lilith both staring at me, I finally pushed out some words.

“Who are you?”

The corners of his mouth curled into a crooked smirk.

“I have many names. Most of which are forgotten. Some are muttered in times of weakness. Others in damnation.”

I could barely hold myself together.

“Oh my god.”

“Not quite.”

He leaned forward in his chair.

“Do you like your gifts?”

“It… it was you? The money?”

“Don’t forget your family, dear boy. Are they not the best gift?”

“What are talking about? Don’t you hurt my family.”

“Oh I would never harm them. Especially young Raziel here.”

“How do you know his name!?”

“I chose it.”

I looked to my son in my arms, then to Lilith, still gazing at me unblinking.

“What do you want from us? Why do this? The money for all those years. Lilith… is Lilith a gift too?”

“Of course. Did you not ask for this? In your times of darkness, did you not ask for assistance? You prayed to many but I alone listened.”

“Who the fuck are you?”

I was sobbing at this point. I had no idea what was happening anymore.

“I’m simply… a business man. I’m here to collect on my part of the deal.”

“My soul?”

He laughed to himself.

“Not this time, no.”

He gestures towards my son.

“I am merely here to… see Raziel here.”

He reaches over and gently gives Raziel’s tiny hand a shake. 
He smiles at my son and leans back in his chair again.

“Listen carefully to me. Ensure the safety of this child. Your life will continue as it has these past few years. You will remain wealthy. Once I leave, everything will be as it should.”

“I… I don’t care about the money anymore. My family is enough wealth for me now.”

“Don’t be foolish. Disregarding a gift from me is very unwise.”

He stands up from his chair and looks down upon me.

“Treasure these moments… While you can. There will come a day when I return for the child. His destiny lies elsewhere.”

And with that, he walks out of the room and dissipates as he reaches the hallway.

The lights return and everything returns to normal.

I turn to Lilith, who seems to back to her ordinary self. 

“Babe, I could destroy a bacon cheeseburger right now.”

Her smile fades as she sees me. Probably still a wreck.

“Babe, what’s wrong?!”

How did she just ask about food at a time like this? Does she not remember what just happened? 

I still doubt it was real sometimes. 

I never mentioned it to Lilith. I don’t want her to think I’m crazy or even worse… that it was real and she knows exactly who that man was.

I still get nightmares about it. 

I’ve even noticed that anyone I interact with feels like they’re on a script. They’re way too nice. Neighbours I don’t like smile and wave when I drive past. Creepy ‘body snatcher’ type stuff.

I write this as I look over Raziel in his crib. He’s sound asleep. He’s perfect. Too perfect. He barely crys or makes a sound. He’s… unsettling. I don’t know how it’s possible but I don’t think he’s even mine.
