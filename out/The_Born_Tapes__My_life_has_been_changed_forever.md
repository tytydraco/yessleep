I used to have nightmares when I was younger. They all had similar themes. Some I would be bound unable to move, some I would be in a car going down a stretch of road with the engine roaring louder and louder, and sometimes it was just sound. In these dreams I couldn’t see, I couldn’t move, and my mouth was seemingly taped shut as no matter how hard I tried, nothing would escape my lips. There was only the sound of static mumbling from what I guess to be a radio somewhere. I could never make out what it was saying. My Mum died during childbirth. I think these dreams were my body’s way of processing the whole thing of not having her around. My dad found other ways. Usually, the ones where his lips were at the end of a bottle, but I don’t judge him. He would get angry sometimes, but he never made me feel afraid of him. We were on the road a lot for his job so he would give me lessons on things like Maths, English, and History. When I was 17, he found a job where we wouldn’t have to move around so much. We had our first real home, one without wheels. I started a job as a paper boy and committed myself to online courses for a couple years. He didn’t believe it, nor would anyone else when I told him I had been accepted to join the police force.  This is where I came across “The Born Tapes”

 

My first 3 months on the force involved shadowing the head of Crime Scene Investigation, Detective Crawford.  He was pushing 60 but he was brighter, faster, and wittier than anyone in the department. He was nice to me when he had to be, but I liked it how strict he was. Thanks to him I had a routine and a career I looked forward to growing into. The first few weeks largely came down to picking up his morning coffee by the time he came in around 6 AM, and then sitting at my desk deciphering and converting his notepad into a Word document alongside writing up any reports. That was all until last week when he placed a camera on my desk.

 

“What’s this?”          

 

“Work.”

 

“Right…. but what is it?”

 

He sighed. “Plug it into the computer’s USB and watch the recordings. Someone handed it to us a couple years ago saying he had gotten it from some guy at a flea market selling a box of junk. I tried figuring it out, but it only led to dead ends and closer to my Wife filing for a divorce. I like to get the new guys to look at it to see if they can find the thing we never could.”

 

With that, he left. I picked up the camera, the USB cord already attached, and flipped it over in my hand. Scratched into the side was the word “Born”. Shrugging I plugged it into the computer and clicked on the first video file.

 

The first file was titled “Meal”. The video was shot from a first-person perspective and lasted all of 1 minute. The person filming was sitting in a café as a waitress walked over to their table and placed down a coffee and 4 slices of toast on a plate. The camera was then placed down on the table as the person’s hands came into the frame above. They had brown sleeves, and their hands were impossibly grimy. They picked up a slice of toast and began to tear away the crust. Once done, they picked up the coffee and placed the crustless toast on the plate beneath. They then slid the plate to the side of them in front of the seat beside them in the booth. The camera was then picked back up and was now facing the empty space beside them where the plate was placed in front of. The camera remained in this position for 10 seconds before the person reached out their hand and patted the empty seat. The video then ended.

 

File 2 was titled “Lucky”. This video was again shot from a first-person perspective but this time it only lasted 12 seconds. The camera was positioned as if being a dash cam in the front window of what I assumed to be a car. The video consisted of a man and a woman pushing their baby in a pram across the road in front. This was all that happened.

 

File 3 was titled “Prophecy”. In this video, the camera was positioned to look out of a window. The glass was cracked in several places with a thick coating of dust obscuring the view slightly. I assumed it was maybe filmed in a shed since in the bottom right corner of the video you could see the edge of a wooden windowsill and the ends of a green finger from maybe a glove. Outside of the window was a field of wheat. After about 20 seconds a figure shuffled into view outside the window. They were wearing a long white gown far too big for them as the sleeves came past their hands and dangled only inches from the ground. Their face was covered in makeup. So much so that the eyes appeared black from a heavy application of eye shadow and their face was completely white save for a choice of vibrant red lipstick and two large circles of pink on both of their cheeks. They had long, bright blonde hair that curled around their shoulders. They were too far away from the camera to make out any details of what they may have looked like besides the costume. They stood there staring at the camera holding their hands, or rather their sleeves together in front of them. After 30 seconds they made a motion with their arms as if rocking a baby. The figure then walked out of frame. The sound of a door being opened could be heard in the background before the camera was picked up and the video ended.

 

File 4 was titled “Storm”. This video was again shot from the first person and lasted 9 minutes. The first 4 minutes were seemingly shot from the same window as the file “Prophecy”. Outside the window, the viewer could see exactly what the name suggested, a storm. Heavy rain pelted against the window, and I even thought it was going to force it open. In the distance, although the video was at night, you could make out clouds that flashed white periodically shortly followed by the sound of thunder. Throughout the entire video, a baby could be heard crying in the background. The person filming turned around to reveal a baby in what could only be a bed the person had tried to make using a brown coat that was possibly from the video “Meal”. The person filming walked slowly towards the baby positioning the camera inches away as the child’s face filled the frame. Turning red, tears, and snot running down their cheeks as their whaling screams continued. The person filming then made a tutting sound and walked over to the window before and picked up a brown toy bear from a pram and gave it to the child. The child accepted the toy but continued to cry. The person filming then yelled and exited the room stomping their feet as they entered a small bedroom slamming the door behind them as the child continued to cry. In the room, there was a yellow-stained bed and beer bottles all over the floor. There was a blonde wig on top of the bed beside an open book. The person filming walked over to the book and picked it up. It was a Bible. They carefully moved it to their bedside table before ending the recording.

 

The final file was titled “Becoming a Man”. The video was again from a first-person perspective and started with the person filming sitting on the bed from the video previous with their legs crossed in front of them. The door was open, and the table was in view with the baby asleep holding the bear. The person filming stood up and walked over to the baby. They made a tutting sound again and wagged their grimy finger in front of the baby. The baby began to stir at this point. The person filming then snatched the bear from the baby as it instantly began to cry again. They then slammed their fist on the table and pointed at the baby. Still pointing they backed their way towards a door and walked outside. Turning away from the building the video revealed a thick wooded area as the bear was flung into the shrubbery. They then walked back inside, the baby still crying, and walked into the bedroom picking up a beer bottle. They then walked back over to the table and gave it to the baby who batted it away with their hand causing it to smash on the floor. The camera then moved from side to side as if indicating the person was nodding their head “no” as they tutted again and scooped up the shards of glass. They then placed the glass beside the coat. The video then ended.

 

It was late by the time I finished, and I was just as confused as when Detective Crawford gave me the camera. I didn’t know what to make of the tapes. I felt useless for not being able to think up a single opinion or conclusion as to who or where the person who owned the camera was. One thing was for certain though. I was disturbed. Disgusted in fact. What had I just watched? Who filmed that? Did they abduct that baby? I seem to think so at least. If it wasn’t then why was the video of the family titled “Lucky”? Why did they treat the child so poorly?” What was the Prophecy? Was it some demented way of deluding themselves into thinking the child was a gift? When I arrived home my dad greeted me at the door.

 

“Hey Champ, how was work?”

 

“It was fine”

 

“Doesn’t sound fine to me”. Raising an eyebrow at me.

 

“It's just… One of the cases got to me is all.”

 

“Well, I got just the thing to take your mind off it.”

 

“Really?”

 

“Yep! There's a box of my old stuff upstairs. It’s been waiting all day for someone to move it”

 

“Really dad? You couldn’t do that yourself”

 

“Hey, hey. I move boxes for a living, why would I do it for free?” He said chuckling to himself.

 

I walked past him and up the stairs to his room. The box was on his bed ready for me. Sighing I picked it up. Rocking in my hands a little a tennis ball rolled out of the top bouncing on the floor and under the bed. Rolling my eyes and cursing to myself I put the box down and bent down to get the ball. As I grabbed the ball, I couldn’t help but notice a box of cameras. Call it curiosity but I couldn’t help but look as I dragged the box out. I picked one of the cameras up flipping it in my hand…. Scratched into the side read the words “Road Trip”. My hands shook, my mouth quivering, and heart racing. What is this? Why is it here? Why does it look the same as the Born Camera? All these questions and more raced through my mind. My legs buckling as I stood up, I put the camera in my pocket and walked downstairs.

 

“H- He- “. I made an impression as if clearing my throat. “Hey Dad, I left something at work. I'll move the box when I’m back okay, I don’t want someone taking my things.”

 

“Oh okay, Son! Don’t be long or I’ll end up having to come after you myself.” Chuckling to himself again from the living room.

I opened the front door and carefully closed it behind me before bolting up the drive to my car and taking off into the night. My whole life has been a lie. What did he do to me? What did that thing do to me? I pulled into the empty car park of the police station and let myself in and plugged the "Road Trip" camera into my computer. There were 5 more videos.

File 1 was named "Warning". My hands trembled as I clicked on the video. My fears were soon realised as a figure wearing the same costume as the figure from the video "Prophecy", shuffled into frame. The camera was facing the door that opened outside the shed as the figure stood within the door frame holding their hands together just as the video "Prophecy" started. It was dark outside. The figure stood in the doorway for 2 minutes before entering the building and walking over towards the camera. Just before reaching the camera, red and blue lights flashed in the background from within the forest. The light seemed to fill the whole room inside as the figure broke into a sprint towards the camera. They picked up the camera and positioned it to face the baby before panning the frame towards the door as the person filming made a sign as if to cross themselves . The video ended with the figure picking up the baby and making their way to the door.

I was crying at this point. Why did my dad have this? I wasn't convinced. Surely, this wasn't my dad. Surely it was just like how the "Born Tapes" were found and he had just bought them at a flea market... Right? I frantically clicked on file 5, which was titled "Proud." There seemed to be a passage of time by this point as the camera started from within a dark room in front of an open door. In the room beyond, the camera showed a boy sat on the edge of a motel bed. The boy looked roughly around the age of eight.... it was me. My stomach dropped. My mind raced. I don't know what to do, but I have to watch the rest. I have to get the rest of those cameras from under my Dad's bed.
