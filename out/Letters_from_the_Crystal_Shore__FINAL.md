[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fpclaz/letters_from_the_crystal_shore/)



A few hours later I found myself walking through campus. I was getting a few odd stares as I trekked. I had tried to clean myself to the best of my ability after I woke up from the dream but I was on edge. In the shower, every time I would close my eyes the scent would hit me and the water pattering would morph into a cackle. I eventually got clean enough and threw on some new clothes. 



Just like last time when I woke up, the letter was folded neatly on the ground near where I had opened it. I grabbed it this time without giving it my full attention and shoved it into my bag. 



I was feeling drained, just like the first time except on a whole new level. My head just felt murky, my thoughts slightly out of reach and disheveled, like I was trying to read them from just below the surface of a pond barely getting enough strength to lift my face above the water only to drift back down.



Eventually, I made it to the library and asked the old librarian if the school had any books on glyphs. She leaned down to type on her computer and I thought I felt someone's presence behind me. I didn’t think much of it until I heard a faint chuckle. My head whipped around without me thinking and found a girl laughing at something on her phone. She jumped back a little at my abrupt movement and I quickly apologized but she didn’t move back to fill the space she previously occupied. After another moment the librarian pointed me in a direction on the second floor of the library. The girl was giggling again but I forced myself to keep moving.



I eventually found my destination. It was a few rows of shelves dedicated to languages. There was more here than I could ever hope to go through, some I had heard of and others that were long dead.



I searched through a few that contained varying scriptic languages, Egyptian, Sumerian, and even Mayan but nothing quite matched up. I stayed there for hours trying to find at least a clue about the letter, but nothing ever appeared. Any lead I thought I had died off and led to nothing, at least it did for my limited understanding. A little while later after the lights had come on and the sun had fallen I was deep into a book when a voice spoke.



“Find an interest in languages son?” an old inquisitive voice broke my concentration.



I nearly lept out of my chair. Turning to face the man I nodded. He was an old gentleman, I guessed a professor of some kind based on the attire.



“I’m trying sir, but I can’t seem to find exactly what I’m looking for.”



“Why don’t you let me take a look, perhaps I can help you out.” 



I reached to get some paper out of my bag to try and draw what I was looking for but I decided to take another approach. Grabbing the paper I handed it to him folded up. He took it and inspected it for a moment.



“Odd,” he stated, “where did you get this from?”



I thought about lying but I was desperate for answers, “It was in a letter that just showed up in my apartment.” I gave him a few other details but decided to leave out the dream part. Figuring that I needed to get out of this without getting an ambulance called and ending up in a ward somewhere.



He stared at me for a moment before answering, “Interesting… well, let's see what we're working with,” he cracked the paper open and blinked a few times before his mouth twitched slightly and then crawled upwards opening up into a toothy grin. It only lasted for a moment before his muscles eased and he was once again a relaxed old man. There was a prickling sensation on the back of my neck.



“Do you mind if I take this with me young man? I have more materials back in my office that can help me find out what these are.”



“Yeah, please, that would be great,” I said, shaking my head in agreement, “I’ll be here again tomorrow or would you like to meet somewhere else?.”



“Here is fine, shouldn’t take me too long,” he said before nodding to me, "Well, I’ll be going then,” the man said as he turned and began sauntering off, holding the paper at his side. The paper that I could see was still devoid of writing. I stood and began to walk after him but as I reached the end of the bookshelf an acrid smell hit me and suddenly I jolted, founding myself standing on a shimmering shoreline. I blinked and rubbed at my eyes, opening them again to find myself back in the library. I needed some sleep. Peering around the corner there was no sign of the professor. I sighed. Hopefully, I would be getting some answers tomorrow.



Rest that night didn’t come easy. I tossed and turned deep into the night, how late is anyone's guess but I woke up the next morning feeling slightly better than yesterday. The morning was a blur. The bags under my eyes were darker and the mark on my neck an angrier shade of red. The fact that I couldn’t stop scratching at it definitely wasn’t helping.



I skipped breakfast as I didn’t feel like I could eat, I wondered briefly when the last time I ate was but didn’t care too much. Today I had to get some kind of answer. 



The library was the same as yesterday and I skipped the front desk and went back to the same spot in the language section. The professor wasn’t there yet so I made myself comfortable. Hours passed, it was getting late and there was still no sign of the professor. I wasn’t giving up though. I would wait all night if I had to. My eyes were dropping low and at some point they closed completely.



“Trying to solve the puzzle are we?”



My eyes opened and I found myself in a thicket of charred trees. The scent of ash was overbearing, but not potent enough to drown out the familiar stench. The voice continued.



“You listened to my suggestions, without question. What a good little human,” the voice paused and I could almost feel a smile directed at me, “or is it because you're finding it harder to think clearly,” a hoarse voice sounded within the trees before low chuckles rolled through from all directions. I tried to pinpoint the source and thought I caught little glimmers of movement, but never a solid thing. It flittered by just out of clear view. 



“What is happening to me?” I half yelled and half questioned my dark surroundings.



“Now nobody likes spoiling the ending,” he stated and my head twinged. Then it did it again, and again. I winced trying to silence the nagging in my head. I felt a head rest on my shoulder this time and found I could move. I jerked around and found the professor looking at me.



“You alright son?” 



I was back in the library again. I found my hands in a vice covering the nape of my neck. I released them and tugged at my hoodie to make sure it was covered.



“Yeah, sorry just a little tired” I lied, partially, “what have you got for me professor.”



Taking in the professor, I noticed that he was looking a little disheveled. His polo was wrinkled and his hair unkempt compared to the uptight visage he carried yesterday, now he looked, off. I thought about what had transpired the day before and decided to ask, “Professor, can you even see what’s on the paper?”



“What do you mean,” he smiled, “no, of course I can’t,” he laughed a little before continuing, “after all, how can I see what wasn’t meant for me?”  



“What,” I asked, all tiredness leaving my voice as a new feeling overtook me. Unease crept up my spine and into my throat, “meant for me, what are you even talking about?”



“Ohh, the letters only find people with stories. Stories to make, or a story to tell,” as he finished I was reminded of what the man in the burnt forest told me about people being stories. I knew that I needed to leave. I was suspecting that the professor was somehow involved in this. Was this why the thing in my dream told me to come to the library? Does the professor know about the dreams? 



I stood, moving to leave. I brushed by the professor and he smelled burnt. Like ash.



“Everyone has a story, the god of the black sea will take them all.”



I was running before I even knew it. The run back to my apartment was long and frantic. I kept seeing shadows move out the corner of my eye but didn’t stop to give them attention. The people I passed voices jumbled together and became laughter as I ran. Slowly fading off into the distance until finally I was at my apartment. The singular building on a dark lit street never looked so inviting. I ran up the stairs and burst inside, slamming and locking the door behind me.



I just stood there for a while panting trying to catch my breath and slow my heart down a bit before it came up my throat. My neck itched something awful and no amount of scratching could ease it. I went to the bathroom to splash my face. Bending down I cupped some water and threw it over my face, scrubbing a lot harder than necessary. Reaching out blindly I grabbed a towel and wiped myself clean then opened my eyes.



A floorboard out in the hall creaked and I turned to the noise. Half illuminated in the bathroom light were two midnight irises, so dark they would stand out in a sea of shadow. They were piercing right through and into me. The eyes began to move closer and the whole house shuddered. 



I felt the mark on me begin to writhe and squirm. I reached out and slammed the door shut. I took a few steps backwards until my heel connected with my shower and I tumbled backwards, taking the curtain down with me.



My vision darkened and I began to hyperventilate, bringing the plastic liner firm against my mouth with my gasps and beginning to throw my arms around wildly to throw it off. Eventually I could see again. The yellow hue from a fluorescent light had never felt so inviting.



Something pressed into the door. The hinged squealed in protest but eventually it let up. Slowly, black ooze began to seep through the crack. My head began to pound, the substance smelled like ash and decay. Little oily tendrils sprout out of the growing mass randomly, reaching, searching.



I tried to think of a way out. The only way would be to step into the substance and try the door, I knew already that would be futile. The mass was only increasing and is beginning to drip from the sides. 



Then I looked in the tub and something caught my eye at the bottom. A corner sticking out just below the shower curtain I had wrestled off. An old yellowed corner. 



With shaking hands I reached out and grabbed it, pulling it free. I screamed in anger, the black sludge seemed to pulse and began flowing in faster. It had now covered the floor entirely, turning it into a viscous void of light.



Then I thought of my phone. I pulled it out and called the police.



“”Hello?” A woman's voice came through.



I told her that I was trapped and needed help. I left nothing out, my care of sounding sane was gone because what was happening was not in the realm of sanity. A trip to the loony bin would beat this any day. The line went quiet. Then laughter cut through the line and it felt like an ice pick plunged into my eye. They laughed and laughed, until finally another voice came out.



“You know what you have to do boy,” a voice sounding just like the professor came through.  There was a pause as slight cuts of static came through warping the audio, “come tell us your story.” The line cut and I was left alone. I tried calling again but all I got was white noise.



It’s been about two hours since then and I’ve written all this down. I don’t know what will happen if I try to post this. Maybe no one will get it, maybe someone will. The sludge is up to my stomach now. I can feel it, the tendrils reaching out and molding to me. The door it glued shut. It’s so cold and I’m getting tired. 



I’m going to go tell my story, so if you don’t have one. Don’t open the yellowed letter, or it will make one for [you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SoullessHQ/)
