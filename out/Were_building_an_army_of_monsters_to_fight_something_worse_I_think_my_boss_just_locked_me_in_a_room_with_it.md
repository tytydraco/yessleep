Most people dream their nightmares. Mine was assigned to me. 

You can call me Reyes.

I don’t exist—at least, not on paper. No birth certificate. No ID. Not even tax records. I’m a ghost. Twenty-six years-old, with only a single job to my name. The kind you don’t walk away from.

You’ve never heard of my employer. It’s not the CIA or NSA, but something older. A paramilitary outfit so far off the books, the books don’t even know it exists.

Our mission? Hunt monsters, break their minds, rebuild them. Turn boogeymen into weapons. Urban legends into soldiers with teeth.

Monsters into Conscripts.

We call ourselves the Order of Alice.

My job isn't fighting monsters. It's filing them. Cataloguing things that go bump in the night, sorting them into neat little boxes labeled: *“Bad News”* and *“Run for Your Fucking Life.”*

I'm an Analyst, which is a fancy way of saying I'm boredom with a pulse. A living post-it note. The kind of guy who gets passed over, then run over. 

Or at least I was.

It’s funny—they say most nightmares start with falling. But for me, the falling came later.

What came first was the knock. 

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

The silence hit before the lights. 

At first, everything felt normal. Keyboards tapping. Muffled conversations. The mechanical rhythm of an underground office too tired to notice the world ending.

Then the sounds began to vanish—

Clicking keys.

Buzzing lights.

A cough, then nothing.

All of it swallowed—like someone had muted the world.

Then the walls shook. Not a tremor, but a *rumble*. Low and guttural. Like something waking up beneath the floor.

I froze.

Cubicles waved around me like cardboard graves. Fluorescents flickered overhead. My screen glitched—just once. A flicker. A smear of static.

Then the knock.

**BANG.**

My coffee hit the floor.

**BANG.**

I shot to my feet, heart thundering against my ribs.

Three inches of titanium reinforced the office door. Protocol said that was more than enough. If a Conscript ever broke loose from the Vaults—unlikely, but not impossible—the door would hold.

**BANG.**

It wasn’t holding.

I lunged for the emergency lockdown switch. Slammed it.

Metal shrieked as blast shutters clamped over the entrance. Someone behind me whispered a prayer.

“Christ,” a voice rasped. “That sounded close.”

“Could be a Vault breach—”

The lights flickered.

Then the steel *bent.*

Not dented—*warped.* Like something on the other side was punching through material C4 couldn’t scratch.

My lungs locked. I backed up.

The door didn’t open.

It *exploded.*

Sheared off its frame like a decapitated limb and spun across the floor, crashing through three cubicles.

Smoke spilled in.

And something massive stepped through.

It was at least seven feet tall. Maybe more. Its armor looked *grown*, not forged—rusting steel plates shaped like dead leaves, colored in bruised reds and rot-brown. Each step dripped rust and memory.

Atop its shoulders sat a wicker mask, gnarled and sprawling, scraping the ceiling tiles. Twisting upward like scorched antlers.

Someone whispered behind me. “An Overseer…”

“I’ve never seen one that big,” another voice hissed.

“That’s because it’s not supposed to be up here. Look at the suit—it’s an enforcer. It should be guarding the Vaults.”

“Forget the suit. It’s a fucking—”

“Jack.”

My breath caught. They were right.

The playing card pinned to its chest was tattered and dark—but unmistakable.

A **Jack of Clubs**.

“I didn’t even know the ranks went above ten,” a woman muttered.

*Me neither.*

There weren’t any official records of Jacks, Queens, or Kings among the Overseers. The whole concept was little more than water-cooler myth. Ghost stories for Analysts.

And yet…

“My friend swore she saw a memo once—said there was a Joker locked in Vault 6. Might even be an Ace.”

Somebody snorted. “Your friend’s an idiot. Vaults only go to 5. I’ve *been* to 5, and trust me—nothing could escape those cells.”

The Jack exhaled. Like a furnace choking on blood.

The office fell dead quiet.

“Must be a containment breach,” someone whispered, voice raw. “Only reason Clubs ever come topside.”

My stomach dropped. A breach meant something had gotten out. Which meant blood. Which meant bodies. Which meant paperwork.

*Shit.*

And I wasn’t the only one panicking. Fear jumped from desk to desk like static. Within seconds, the whole floor had dissolved into murmurs, gasps, shifting feet.

That’s when Edwards, our timid supervisor, finally emerged from his cubicle. Pale and sweating. The moment he saw the Jack, his eyes went full dinner plate, like he was halfway through a heart attack. 

“Oh my…” he gasped, momentarily forgetting how to speak. “R-Relax, everyone. This is… obviously a miscommunication. I’ll get it sorted right away.”

He cleared his throat and forced a smile, like a man trying to be polite to an avalanche.

“Good morn—err, afternoon, Mr. uhh—Clubs. You seem to be… lost. Understandable. Big bunker and all. Why don’t I walk you back to the elevator, hm?”

The Overseer didn’t react.

Edwards reached out, gave its arm a light tug, like a dad coaxing a toddler from the toy aisle.

It didn’t budge.

Its head snapped sideways—fast. It moved not like something alive, but like a memory. Jerking. Disjointed. Unfinished. Its eyes were black voids, buried in bark-twisted sockets.

And they stared.

At me.

“Analyst Reyes…” it rasped.

The room froze.

Not a breath. Not a whisper.

Just my name—hanging in the air like a curse.

I didn’t even know they could *talk.*

My legs moved on autopilot, inching backward until I hit the wall. My heart kicked at my ribs like it wanted *out.*

The Overseer raised one hand—fingers long and curling. 

Beckoning\*\*.\*\*

I gulped. Pointed at myself with a shaking finger. “You… want *me*?”

It nodded. Its neck creaked like ancient timber splitting in the cold.

I turned, scanning the room. Desperate for someone to speak. To intervene. To *help.* But all I saw were lowered heads. Avoidant eyes.

Cowards in pressed collars, hiding behind masks of bureaucratic obedience.

Fuck. 

*Of all the Overseers… why did it have to be a Clubs?*

They were known for one thing, and one thing only.

Violence.

“Mr. Edwards,” I stammered, voice breaking. “This isn’t protocol. Tell this thing it can’t *do* this.”

Edwards—gaunt with a mane of silver hair—set his jaw. He took a breath. 

He once joked that stampeding monsters were nothing compared to the MREs he ate in Kabul. I figured he was exaggerating. Now I wasn't so sure.

He squared his shoulders the way I imagine soldiers do when someone yells incoming. “Now listen here. My employee is absolutely right. You have *no authority* to—”

The Overseer moved, dragging Edwards behind it like lint on a sleeve.

“**Analyst Reyes,**” it said again in a low and final tone. “You have been *requested.* Specifically.”

Fingers like steel cables coiled around my tie.

Lifted.

I thrashed. Kicked. Didn’t matter. I was a paperclip dangling from a skyscraper, and no matter how loud I shouted, nobody dared to move. 

They just watched. Stunned. Haunted. Like it was already too late. 

“**Stop!**” Edwards bellowed, his voice losing its nervous tremble. My anxious supervisor suddenly found his spark—turning braver than the whole office combined.

“For God’s sake,” he shouted, chasing us into the hall. “You *can’t* just abduct my staff! The Inquisition will have your *head* for this—you’ll be shuffled back into the bloody Deck!”

The Overseer paused at the elevator. Turned back.

“The Inquisition,” it said, almost amused. “... Who do you think sent me?”

Edwards’ jaw dropped.

“No…” he whispered. “They wouldn’t. Not an employee. Not unless—”

The PA crackled overhead.

A woman’s voice, cold as ice and sharp as law:

“**Edwards. Stand down.**”

His face drained of color. The fire in his eyes vanished, replaced by something closer to shock—almost… betrayal.

“…Owens?” he whispered, staring up at the hallway camera.

Owens.

Director of Inquisitions. 

Wonderful.

If she wanted me—if she'd personally signed the order—then something was very wrong here.

“Why now?” Edwards asked, voice choked. “Reyes isn’t—”

The PA cut him off.

“The situation has changed.”

A pause.

“The First Draft has stirred again. It seeks the Pair.”

The First Draft?

The Pair?

I’d never heard the terms. Were they some kind of codename? Some buried Conscripts that no one talked about?

“That can’t be right,” Edwards muttered, voice haunted. “The First Draft—Ash, we agreed it wasn’t real.”

“And we were wrong.”

Edwards stopped breathing.

Owens’ voice again. Cold. Final.

“Jack of Clubs. Bring Analyst Reyes to Chamber 13. Immediately.”

“Chamber 13?” Edwards reeled. “You can’t be serious. You can't honestly think Reyes is—”

“Enough, Edwards. Let me clarify the stakes: either the Order ends tonight… or Reyes does.”

The PA crackled as Owens signed off.

Edwards slumped against the wall. His face not registering fear, but resignation.

“Wait!” I shouted, lunging forward. “Please—!”

But I saw it then, just before the elevator doors slid shut. Edwards staring at us. Like he’d seen a ghost. Like his worst nightmare had somehow dreamed itself to life.

Only he wasn’t looking at the monster. 

He was looking at me.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

The elevator hissed shut.

The Overseer clamped a tarantula-sized hand around my neck. It jabbed a finger at the elevator panel, each input stiff and deliberate, like it was forcing the building itself to obey.

The screen above flickered.

Not green. Not blue.

Red.

Ten digits scrolled across in silence. No labels. No indicators. Just a blinking cursor and a sound like a lock being unpicked in reverse. Owens told the Overseer to bring me to Chamber 13. I’d never heard of it—but whatever it was, it turned Edwards whiter than a sheet. 

“Where’s Chamber 13?” I croaked. 

The Overseer turned those hollow sockets on me. Its voice was dry as rust. “Within the Vaults.”

My blood curdled. The Vaults were for Conscripts—monsters. They buried at the bottom of the bunker, the kind of deep that doesn’t show up on maps, only warnings.

“There’s been a mistake,” I said, pulse pounding. “I’m not cleared for anything below Level Three. Listen, I’m just an Analyst. I punch numbers. I run audits. I don't—”

The elevator jolted violently.

A groan like bending steel. Then a *crack!*—sharp, sudden. One cable. Then another.

“Oh, fuck…”

We dropped.

Not a smooth descent. Not free fall.

This was *propulsion*.

As if the earth had opened its throat and we were being swallowed whole.

I tried to scream. What came out was a ragged choke, my cheeks flapping like canvas in a gale.

The Overseer didn’t flinch. It shoved me down, flattening me against the floor.

Wind screamed through unseen vents. The walls trembled. My ears rang. My body wasn’t falling—it was *disappearing*.

Light shrank to a pinprick. Pressure caved in. My knees buckled. My head swam.

Just before everything vanished, I heard the voice.

Not the Overseer’s.

Hers. 

The woman that haunted my dreams.

The Ma’am.

It rang all around me. Syrupy. Mocking.

*“Never forget that I’m the one writing your story,”* she hissed. *“And that I can end it whenever I please.”*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

And just like that—I was back there.

Back in the house I tried to forget.

Sunlight filtered through slats in the boarded windows, casting stripes of gold and shadow across the breakfast table. A pale tree had broken through the floorboards and grown tall through the ceiling, its bark smooth and bone-colored, its branches heavy with parchment where there should have been leaves.

The Ma’am reached up and plucked one.

She returned to the table, where her latest draft lay scattered. Her glasses rested low on her nose, her pen already back in motion. She didn’t look at me.

I never called her mother.

It wasn’t allowed. 

She said *Ma’am* was a title of respect. Said it would make me a better boy than the others—the ones she sent outside. The ones who never came back from the Thousand-Acre Wood.

“You’re staring,” she said, still marking the page. “You know that isn’t welcome behavior, Boy.”

I mumbled an apology and lowered my eyes to the plate. My eggs had gone cold.

Her fingers began to drum. Slow. Uneven. A rhythm I knew by heart—the countdown to something cruel. Then, with a sharp exhale, she dropped the pen.

“Eat,” she snapped. “Carol didn’t make those eggs so you could stir them like a little brat, did you, Carol?”

Behind me, something clanged.

Carol—the older woman who hovered by the stove like a caretaker and a ghost—hurried forward, wiping her hands on her apron. Her plate trembled in her grip, but her smile… somehow, it stayed warm.

Always warm.

“He’ll learn, dear,” she said gently. “He’s still just a child.”

I smiled at her. Small. Grateful. Even now, I could feel it—that aching kind of affection that blooms after a nightmare, sharp and tender and temporary. She was the only one who ever tried to protect me.

Carol set her plate down and ruffled my hair with a hand that smelled like thyme and dish soap.

“He can’t help being distracted on occasion,” she teased. “Isn’t that right, Levi?”

The name cracked the moment in half.

The Ma’am’s mug detonated against the table. Coffee splashed across pages and skin. Her face didn’t move, but her eyes had locked onto Carol with a heat that could’ve peeled wallpaper.

“What did I say about using that name?” she hissed. “He is to be referred to as *Boy*—until such time I decide to keep him.”

Carol froze. Her smile withered.

The Ma’am turned her gaze to me. Her voice went soft.

“Isn’t that right… *Boy*?”

I nodded quickly, stuffing a bite of egg into my mouth like it might save me. 

Carol’s voice came smaller now. “It’s just… maybe he’d do better if he had more encouragement. More love.”

The Ma’am stood.

The slap came without warning.

A sharp crack against Carol’s cheek. The second blow was already rising.

I was on my feet before I even realized it. “Don’t!”

The Ma’am turned.

Slow. Methodical. Like a snake uncoiling mid-strike. 

“Did you just give me a command, *Boy*?”

Each step she took sounded louder than it should’ve. Like the house was listening.

The Ma’am was a small woman, brittle at the edges, with goldenrod hair that might’ve once made her look soft. But her beauty had curdled. Her cheekbones jutted like broken glass. Her eyes were bone-dry wells.

And still—still—I was terrified of her.

“It wasn’t a command, Ma’am,” I said, heart galloping. “I only meant… it wasn’t Carol’s fault. I messed up. So I should be punished.”

She blinked. Once.

Then smiled.

That awful, thin-lipped smile. The one that said *I win.*

“You see, you old crone?” she crooned, not even glancing at Carol. “The Boy doesn’t need affection. He needs *correction.* Even he understands that.”

She sank back into her chair, plucking a fresh page from the branches above.

“Maybe he won’t end up like the rest of his worthless siblings,” she said, almost cheerfully. “The last thing this family needs is another failed draft.”

Carol stood still. Her hands trembled at her sides.

The Ma’am’s voice snapped like a whip. “Well? Are you deaf *and* senile? You made me break my mug. Clean it up. Or I’ll send you to the woods too.”

Carol didn’t move.

Not at first.

For a single breath, her face hardened. And for the first time, I saw it. Not fear. **Defiance.**

Then she looked at me.

And what I saw in her eyes wasn’t pity. It wasn’t grief.

It was love.

The kind that stays, even when leaving would be easier.

She knew exile would be safer. That the forest, with its Hungry Things and whispers, was still kinder than the Ma’am. But she wouldn’t leave me behind.

She straightened, hands still trembling.

“Of course, dear,” she said quietly. “My mistake.”

I wanted to scream. To tell her it *wasn’t her mistake.* That the Ma’am deserved the woods. Deserved worse.

But I didn’t.

Because this wasn’t real.

This was a memory.

And now the edges were beginning to rot. The wallpaper peeled in long curls like shedding skin. The windows oozed. Table legs warped and coiled like roots seeking soil.

And the portraits—

Dozens of them. Hung crooked. Bleeding. The Ma’am’s visions of her monster. The Hare.

Some bore antlers. Others wore hats. One had no face at all.

And still, they smiled.

Their mouths opened in eerie unison, wide and wet and grinning. And they sang my name.

Soft. Rhythmic. Like a lullaby at a funeral.

I reached out to tear one from the wall, and the whole world came down with it. 

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

I jolted awake to the sound of steel screaming.

The elevator was still falling. Groaning, buckling, folding in on itself like a dying animal.

I tried to move—couldn’t. Thick arms locked me in place. The Overseer. It must’ve caught me when I blacked out, snatching me out of the air before physics could pulp me against the ceiling.

Christ.

I twisted in its grip, craning my neck toward the gnarled wicker mask. The Jack of Clubs stared back, hollow sockets swallowing all light.

“Brace yourself,” it growled.

**REEEEEEEEEEEE**

The shriek that followed could’ve cracked teeth. The brakes had kicked in—but they were losing. The Overseer lifted me off the grated floor, cradling me like a toddler. 

Then: impact.

The world punched upward. Steel howled. Concrete split. My lungs collapsed inward like paper bags in a vacuum. If the Overseer hadn’t absorbed the brunt, my legs would’ve come out my ears.

A soft ding broke the silence. A chipper voice chimed through the speaker overhead:

“**THANK YOU FOR VISITING LEVEL SIX. PLEASE STANDBY FOR REALITY EQUALIZATION.”**

The Overseer dropped me, my knees hitting metal with a hollow thud. Then came the retching.

When I could breathe again, I wiped my mouth with a shaking sleeve. “Did I… Did I hear that right?” My voice sounded like it was trying to crawl out of my throat. “We’re on Level 6?”

The Jack of Clubs gave a stiff nod.

No. No, that wasn’t possible. 

There wasn’t any such thing as Level 6. That was the whole point. Everyone knew the bunker had five levels. Orientation drilled it into us like gospel—five levels and no deeper. You ask about Level 6, you get a warning. Ask twice, you get reassigned. Ask three times?

You just didn’t.

I gripped my hair, heart thundering. This didn't make sense. None of this made any goddamn sense.

The Overseer tilted its head, slow as a glitching puppet. “Your eyes,” it whispered. “They sing wrong… songs.”

My stomach knotted. “My what?”

“We remember when ours sang that way…” The Jack began sniffing, each inhale ragged and wet. It took a step forward. Predatory. Curious. Like something just before a kill. “So faint above… but down here… yes. Down here, your stench is inescapable. Familiar…”

Its hand rose toward my face—

“**REALITY EQUALIZATION COMPLETE**,” the speaker chirped. “**SUB-VAULT ACCESS GRANTED.”**

The Overseer froze. Then it withdrew like someone hit the reset button. Shook its head. Backed off.

A shudder ran through me. What was going on with this thing—was it malfunctioning?

Or is this why Owens wanted me specifically?

**“PLEASE TRAVERSE THE SUB-VAULTS RESPONSIBLY,”** the speaker continued. **“REMEMBER: YOUR SANITY IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!”**

Steam hissed from the seams in the wall. The doors screeched open—revealing something impossible.

The hallway ahead twisted like a draining whirlpool, red-brick walls spiraling into infinity. The corridor turned as I watched it, slow and deliberate, like it was breathing. Moonlight poured down from a black sky. My eyes stung.

This had to be an illusion. It had to be.

The Overseer shouldered past me, its bulk making the stone quake. “Stay close,” it ordered. “Do not linger. Do not stray.”

I staggered after it, glancing back at the elevator—which was now twisting too, warping as if it were never built for this world.

Whispers came back to me. Lunch break horror stories. A supposed pocket dimension beneath the bunker, used to house Conscripts that couldn’t be held by conventional means. A collapsible plane of reality. Apparently, the Sub-Vaults would rearrange themselves every few hours, like a maze rewritten in real time, rendering escape impossible. 

Through glass panels, I glimpsed nightmares: geometries that hurt to look at, shapes that shouldn’t exist. Colors with no name—colors that pulsed like tumors. The deeper we traveled, the more I tried to maintain any grasp on reality by subconsciously analyzing the Conscripts. Anchoring myself in what I knew. 

“Threat Level 5,” I whispered. “Localized massacre potential. Recommendation: reinforced containment. Threat Level 6….”

Cell doors lined the walls—some no larger than confession booths, others yawning wide enough to admit mountains.

One door had hinges the size of coffins. Another had *teeth*.

I didn’t ask what they held.

A chill spidered down my spine anyway, like some part of me already knew.

Laughter echoed from somewhere distant.

Or maybe sobbing.

Or maybe both—blended into something wet and wrong, the kind of sound that peeled paint and rewrote memories.

I don’t know.

The deeper we went, the harder it became to separate noise from thought. Sound from shape. Sanity from suggestion.

The hallway twisted. Twitched. At times, I swore it was breathing.

We passed two other Overseers.

Spades.

Six and Four.

They moved like shadows stitched into armor—taller than the Jack of Clubs, but leaner, narrower. Their suits weren’t rusted like his, but smooth. Sleek. Vanta-black, like they’d been skinned from the void. Spade-tipped spears rested in their hands like questions with bloody answers.

They watched us as we passed. Their heads cocked in mirrored angles. Their voices buzzed, low and backward, like a prayer being unspoken.

A language made of edits.

“What are they saying?” I whispered.

The Jack glanced down at me. “They believe you are a variant—an undealt card. They wish to dissect you.”

Footsteps clanged behind us. The Spades smashed their spear tips on the stone and hissed a phrase that sounded like mangled poetry.

“They think I’m malfunctioning,” the Jack explained, voice flat. “Protecting you instead of the Deck. They intend to correct the error.”

Its fingers flexed—rebar creaking under strain. “They are welcome to try.”

We walked on. The Spades followed for three corridors more, never speaking again. Just watching. Weighing.

And then, with one tilt of the Jack’s head—

They vanished.

Slipped back into the walls like bad ideas. 

Eventually, we stopped.

The Jack reached into its tangled armor and retrieved something impossibly mundane: a brass key.

He fit it into a door that looked… average.

A white, wooden thing. Slightly scuffed. Maybe pine. The kind you’d find in a dentist’s office or a suburban hallway.

Above it, a rusted plaque read:

**CHAMBER 13 — RESTRICTED ACCESS ONLY**

The Jack stepped aside. Gestured for me to enter.

And for the first time since we descended, I hesitated.

Because no door that normal has any right being in a place this wrong.

“Inside,” the Jack ordered.

Nothing else for it, I obeyed. 

Chamber 13 was circular, a stone wheel carved into nothing. A lonely lightbulb hung impossibly from a cracked-open ceiling, where thousands of pages floated in a black expanse. Beneath the bulb were two chairs. A metal table. Nothing else.

The Jack turned to leave. 

“Wait,” I stammered. “That’s it? What am I supposed to do?”

It paused, paid me a long look. “Write.”

“O-okay. Write what? A threat report? A Conscript catalogue? Help me out here.”

The Jack’s voice dropped like a stone into a still lake. “Your ending.”

My heart jackhammered.

Could Overseers tell jokes?

“You have one hour,” the Jack rumbled, deathly serious. “Should you fail to write an ending, one will be provided for you. I'm told it will not be to your… preference.”

“You have one hour,” it said, tone ironclad. “Should you fail to write an ending… one will be provided for you. I’m told it will not be to your… preference.”

And then it left.

The door slammed shut like a gavel.

Lock engaged. Final. Cold.

And just like that—I was alone.

Terrified.

Panicked.

And *achingly* alone.

I lunged for the handle, twisting, yanking. Nothing.

Shit. 

One hour. One ending.

I’d worked for the Order long enough to translate bureaucratic euphemism: if I didn’t scribble something worthwhile fast, they’d send in a Conscript. Probably one with claws. Or teeth. Or an appetite for Analysts.

I sank to the floor.

Back against stone. Hands on my knees like they might keep me from shattering.

I’d filed enough post-mortems to know how our monsters killed. Slowly. With deranged satisfaction. Like children tearing apart their favorite toys just to see what the stuffing looked like.

Fuck. 

Maybe I should just end it myself. Save whoever scrapes up the blood a bit of effort.

That’s when I saw it.

The table. It wasn’t empty anymore.

Something waited beneath the cone of flickering light—something *old*, its shape so familiar it twisted my stomach.

A typewriter.

Not modern. Not sleek. *Rustic.* The kind with keys that bite back, edges like teeth, and ribbons stained the color of clotted memory. It looked… *personal* in an awful sort of way. Like it remembered me somehow. Like it *blamed* me.

I stepped forward, breath hitching.

The chair scraped back with a screech like bone on stone.

I sat.

The bulb above buzzed louder, casting long, twitching shadows across the stone. I stared at the typewriter. It stared back.

I reached out.

My fingers settled on the keys—cold metal nubs worn smooth with use. They *hummed*, faintly. Not mechanical. Not electrical. Something *older*.

Something *alive*.

“Right,” I said softly, voice shaking. “One ending. Coming right up.”

I pressed the first key.

Nothing happened.

I gave a passing thought to the kind of ending I *wanted*.

Something tasteful. Tragic. Maybe bittersweet, if I was feeling literary.

Instead, I settled on the beach.

Somewhere warm. Somewhere quiet. A cabana on a forgotten island where no one knew what the word "Conscript" meant. Where my pension came with an umbrella drink and I could finally grow out my hair without a supervisor filing a grooming report.

Yeah. That’d do.

I cracked my knuckles.

Grinned.

And started to type.

Only—nothing happened.

No words. No sentences. No punctuation. Not even a pity-period.

The page stayed blank.

I mashed the keys harder. Nothing.

I sighed, face-planting onto the desk and cradling my head like it might keep the shame in. “How the hell am I supposed to write my ending with a busted *fucking* typewriter?”

Silence answered.

Then it clicked. 

Not metaphorically. 

Literally. 

The typewriter *clicked*—low and alive, like it was clearing its throat, and the keys began to move on their own. One by one, deliberate and clean, like fingers guided by something long dead and very patient.

*CLACK. CLACK. CLACK.*

I sat up, watching in numb disbelief as the words etched themselves onto the parchment like stigmata.

My pulse thundered.

And then I frowned.

It was… a *work report*?

Boilerplate. Standard. A 431C: Threat Classification Summary.

I’d filed a dozen of them just this week—boring death-sheets for monsters we couldn’t kill and didn’t understand. But this one… this one made my skin crawl.

Not because of the formatting.

Because of the subject.

**ENTITY DESIGNATION:** THE UNWRITTEN ONE

Every major field—*Origin. Abilities. Weaknesses.*—was marked with the same word: **UNKNOWN**

I leaned in, stomach twisting.

**Suit: NIL**

**Rank: JOKER**

My breath caught.

The word sat on the page like a stain.

JOKER.

I’d heard the rumors. Everyone had.

Barstool nonsense. Analyst ghost stories told during overtime shifts—about mythical cards that didn’t belong to any suit. We joked about Kings and Queens locked in the lowest Vaults. About a secret Ace that could overwrite the entire chain of command.

But the Joker?

That wasn’t a card.

That was a *mistake.*

A wild card. A wandering error. A monster so fractured it couldn’t be shuffled back into the Deck.

There weren’t supposed to be any because there *couldn’t be.*

But the typewriter kept typing.

Relentless.

Mechanical.

Certain.

**THREAT CLASSIFICATION: 10 — UNFATHOMABLE**

I reeled.

Ten?

That couldn’t be right. Nine was the ceiling.

Nine was fucking *god-tier*—reserved for time-feeders and dream-slaughterers and everything locked behind reinforced reality.

But this… Ten meant unfileable. Unkillable. It meant we didn’t have a word for what it was, only a prayer for what it *might not* be.

My hands were ice.

I stared at the page and something inside me *shrank.* Not from fear. Not from awe.

From *recognition.*

Is this what the Jack meant when he said I had an hour to write my ending? That if I failed, the Order wouldn’t just kill me—they’d feed me to *this.*

This *Joker.*

This rogue Overseer.

This impossible, uncontainable, unshuffled thing.

I laughed.

Short. Ragged. Ugly.

All this time, I thought I’d been reading a threat report, but I was wrong. I’d been reading a eulogy. 

An obituary for yours truly—all that was missing was a condolence [card](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCryptid/comments/jba8ww/story_master_list/).
