This incident I’m going to talk about happened about a year ago. For context, this was right after the time I graduated from high school; me and my friend whom we will call Devyn, wanted to go celebrate this occasion, but we didn’t have a lot of money to go drive across the county like some of our other classmates were doing. Instead, we just decided to go camping in a state park about 20 minutes away from our town. We decided to go for three days, mainly fishing, hiking, and doing shenanigans that many people wouldn’t be able to see. We brought one tent to share, fishing poles, sleeping bags, and a couple of MREs in case we couldn’t catch anything; we planned to eat the fish we could see in the lake there. Since we were dumb teenagers, we decided that we didn’t want to set up in the campsites but instead set up our tent about half a mile away from one, thinking we could get more privacy there. We planned to sleep for two nights, knowing that if things got bad, we could walk to our car parked at the campsite half a mile away.  
After setting up our tent, we immediately went fishing to catch something for dinner as the sun was setting down fast. We caught our fish, fillet them, and cooked them over the small campfire we made. It was about 9 pm when we were completely done, and we goofed around for a couple more hours before heading to bed. I don’t exactly remember the time we decided to go to bed, but I assumed it was around 11:30. I dozed off for an hour before I woke up, I didn’t remember what seemed off until I looked out the cover of the tent and saw that the fire was out. The thing was, I don’t know us putting out the fire, and there was no way the fire could have gone out that quickly in an hour. I just assumed that Devyn must have woken up sometime before me and put the fire out, so I went back to bed. However, when I woke up and asked Devyn about it, he said he never got up that night, let alone put out the fire. That was the start of the horrific events that would follow.  
That same day, we went hiking around the local trails in the park and again went fishing, but we had yet to find a way this time. We were starving and decided to return to our campsite to grab our MREs for lunch. When we returned to the campsite, though, the whole place was trashed. Everything was lying around. All of our tent contents were thrown around the campsite, and the weirdest part about all of this was that none of them had been stolen. I would have considered initially it a raccoon or another animal, but none of our food or MREs were taken. We ate our lunch, confused and just staring at each other. I think I was getting more scared than Devyn, as the fire last night and the campsite were too coincidental.  
	  
We were considering packing up, except that we only had one night left, and we were going to leave tomorrow morning anyway, so we just decided to stick it out for that last night. And that might have been one of my life's worst decisions. I was tired so I went to bed around 10, and Devyn decided to stay up a little longer before going back to bed. After sleeping for a few hours, Devyn shook me awake and said, “Listen, there’s someone in the woods not far away from our campsite.” I groaned and got up to listen, I checked my watch, and it said 2:13 am. I listened for what seemed like a minute, I was about to tell Devyn to quit playing with me when I heard it. There was someone crying for help in the distance of the woods, it was very distant but you could clearly hear someone in distress, we listened for a few minutes as it got closer to our campsite. We both looked at each other in horror as we heard it. Eventually, the voice got to the edge of our campsite before it just stopped and stood there. I grabbed a flashlight and whispered to Devyn, “If we hear that voice one more time, we are going to fucking book it to the car and leave our stuff.” Devyn nodded in the darkness and agreed. Just as I said that, there was a loud scream, and a tree branch was thrown right onto our tent. I screamed, “Run”, and we both quickly unzipped the tent and dashed it. As we were running, I turned my flashlight in the direction of where the tree branch came from and it there was a tall and lanky pale creature leaning behind one of the trees just staring at us. I only saw it for a glance, but that was all I needed to see before my body was boosted with adrenaline.  
We ran past the campsite and got into our car, I told Devyn to drive us back into the town we came from where we stayed the night. We didn’t even sleep at all that night, we sat in a Walmart parking lot just wondering what we saw. That morning, we drove back to the park and went to our campsite, where our stuff was once again scattered throughout the campsite but nothing was stolen. We drove back and promised to tell none of our friends or family about what we experienced, fearing that we might never get the chance to go camping together again. To this day, Devyn and I wondered what we saw, and I pray no one has experienced what we had in that state park.
