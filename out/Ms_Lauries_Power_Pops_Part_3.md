“You didn’t hear me drop an f-bomb, got it?” I said to [Rosie](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/jFggVsDjOV) as she looked up at me, confused.

“Got it!” Rosie then tugged at my sleeve, like she had done earlier in the evening when we were trick-or-treating. “What’s a [*Fire-starter*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/yA5zlREVtX)*?*”

“It’s a movie, sweetie. We’ll have to watch it, but when you’re a little older.”

Rosie shrugged her shoulders. “Alright.”

My daughter rubbed her eyes and yawned. I yawned too, stretched my back as best I could in the tight confines of this children’s tree house, and started to fall asleep.

Rosie asking me a question woke me up. “Do you know where the bad men took Ben, Mommy?”

I sighed, watching the sun slowly rise in the horizon. “No, Rosie, I don’t,” I replied, stretching my hand. A dull pain radiated throughout my knuckles. A faint evil laugh echoed in my head. “But I think I know of someone who might.”

A rush of anger flooded throughout my body, giving me just enough energy to sit up. I pat Rosie on the leg, trying to wake her up some. “C’mon honey, it’s time to go. We can’t stay up here forever.”

“But I’m tired, Mommy! Let’s just nap for a little bit?” She held my hand, giving me her biggest puppy dog eyes yet. As much as I wanted to give in to the will of my little girl, there was no telling where my son was and what god awful things people were doing to him. Every second counted.

“I know baby, I’m tired too,” I sighed, holding back a yawn, “but we’ve got to go now okay? We’ve got to bring your brother home.”

Rosie took a second to mull it over. “Okay,” she said, picking herself up and patting the dust off the charred remnants of her witch costume.

I grabbed Rosie before she could leave out of the tree house’s entrance. “Wait sweetie, let Mommy go first.” 

If there were any lingering dangers outside I was going out to face it first. There was no way in Hell I was letting anything *else* happen to my daughter. With all the blood and carnage I’d seen in the past few hours, there was no chance I was risking her safety. Lord knows the regret I’d been feeling letting my children eat those damned lollipops made by my psychotic next door neighbor.

Slowly, I climbed down the ladder, scanning the empty park with caution. After waiting a minute to see if any left over militia men would ambush me, I remained unharmed. I gave Rosie the okay signal. Slowly she made her way down the rickety steps. I tried to use my power to hold the old tree steady, but I was so worn out I had no idea if it was working or not.

I had no idea how *anything* worked anymore.

Rosie jumped off the ladder and into my arms. I held her in a tight embrace, silently vowing to never let her go.

“Look how pretty the sunrise is, Mommy,” she said, pointing at the warm tones that filled the sky.

I let her go, staring at the sky with her. “I see, baby. I see.”

“Do you think Ben can see it too?” 

I grabbed Rosie’s hand and started walking towards the park’s entrance, wiping a stray tear from my cheek. “Sure honey, he can see it too,” I lied, trying to give us hope. If we were going to get through this, I needed to believe my boy was alright. “All three of us are looking at the sky right now. Like we’re all together again.” 

“All together again…” Rosie repeated in a whisper. 

“Don’t worry Ben, your little sister will come rescue you! We’re superheroes now!” Rosie shouted proudly, releasing her grasp on my hand. She took off running. I chased after her, unsure if any more soldiers were around. 

I caught up to her and trapped her in a bear hug. “You can’t run off like that, Rosie!” I scolded. I loosened my shaking grasp, looked her in the eyes, and swept some unkempt hair out of her ash covered face. “I know you’re excited and want to save your brother, but the bad men are still out there.”

“I’m sorry, mommy,” she apologized, tears forming on the cusp of her waterline.

I sighed and hugged her again. “It’s okay sweetie. I’ll tell you what, we’re going to play a game.”

“A game!?” Rosie piped up as I walked up to the first car I could find. I tugged on the handle, finding it was locked. I gave up and moved onto the next car.

“We’re going to pretend we’re spies, okay, Rosie-posey? We’ve gotta be quiet and sneaky so the bad guys can’t get us.”

Rosie jumped up and down excitedly. “I love playing spies!”

“I know you do, kiddo,” I chuckled softly as we came across a rusted blue pickup truck down the street. I tugged at the door handle, which miraculously opened. There wasn’t a key in the ignition, so I opened one of the visors. A set of car keys jingled as they fell on to the drivers seat. 

Our luck was seemingly turning around.

“C’mon Rosie, hop in,” I said, walking around and opening the passenger side door.

Rosie reluctantly joined me, hopping into the passenger seat. “But isn’t this stealing? You always tell Ben and I not to steal, mommy.”

I cursed myself for trying to be a good parent.

“We’re not *stealing* it per se,” I said, buckling her in, “We’re just *borrowing* it for a little bit, alright?”

Rosie shrugged her shoulders before dropping the subject.

I closed her door before making my way back to the drivers side of the car. I rested one hand on the top of the truck and the other on the door. 

Exhaustion wracked my body. I had very little energy left, but I needed this to work. I needed to be able to use my power. I needed to be able to do this for my son and my daughter.

My eyes were shut tight as I wished and prayed the truck would become invisible like I had been earlier. If Rosie turned invisible just by touching me, I hoped the same thing would happened with inorganic objects.

I felt a small tug in my gut. When I opened my eyes, the truck and Rosie were both gone. Cautiously, I made my way into the truck.

It was trippy. The moment I stepped foot in the truck’s cabin, I could see both the interior and Rosie again. I still knew we were still invisible though, I could feel it. 

Now we could go home without being seen by anyone.

I put the keys in the ignition, causing the truck to roar to life. I pulled out into the street and slowly headed for the house. The radio buzzed on, an alternative and rock station had just started playing “Disarm” by *The Smashing Pumpkins*. A shiver jolted down my spine as the band name brought back horrific memories from earlier that night.

Our once small and peaceful town looked like the set of a post apocalyptic movie. 

Military vehicles littered the streets. Stray children roamed about while others were running for their lives as soldiers chased after them.

Large pillars of smoke billowed into the sky as small fires were burning everywhere.

I had to park the car as another hummer drove past us. The open back revealed a bunch of guns being shoved in some kids faces. My hand covered Rosie’s eyes as it drove further down the street. I think I recognized one of them as one of the other PTA mom’s daughter. She was a good kid. She didn’t deserve to be treated like that. 

The scenery outside got particularly bad as we neared our house. Near ground zero. We were neighbors with the woman that caused this superpower outbreak after all.

We passed a house with another Hummer parked in the driveway. It was being used to transport dead bodies. All around us, military personnel were piling bodies of the deceased up and then loading as many they could fit in the back of their vehicles. Medic’s carried body after body out of houses all around town. 

The aftermath of everything that happened was bizarre to see. You’d think a war went down here or something. 

“Yay, we’re home!” Rosie mumbled sleepily as we slowly rolled up to the house.

“Which still looks relatively untouched, thankfully,” I muttered to myself. If Rosie heard me, she didn’t seem to care. I knew that look in her eyes. She was eager to get to bed.

I let Rosie rest her eyes for a moment as I double checked our outside surroundings. To my relief, the street was clear of the scary looking Hummers and soldiers. I scanned Laurie’s property. Her porch was empty, but she was there. The smoke of a recently put out cigarette rising from her crystal ashtray clued me in. I also figured she was inside considering the power was still out on our block, yet, a faint glowing light could be seen behind her windows.  

Presence of life was good, because that meant I could end it.

I gently tapped Rosie awake, my pointer finger pressed against my lips to let her know to be quiet. She shook her head In acknowledgment. Slowly, very slowly, I opened the door to the truck, unbuckled her seatbelt, then slid Rosie over the middle console and onto my lap, letting her jump out first. I made sure to maintain skin to skin contact the whole time, still unsure if I could keep things invisible without touching them. It was my turn to get out next. After cautiously sliding out of the driver's seat, I once again carefully shut the car door. I released my grip off the vehicle. The camouflage the blue rust bucket had been under started to dissipate. 

Holding hands, Rosie and I then carefully tip-toed through the yard, past my Jeep with its poor deflated tires, and into the house. As soon as we made it past the doorway, I almost dropped to the floor from exhaustion, unable to use my ability any longer. 

Despite looking normal on the outside, the inside of my home was in complete disarray. A rancid smelling mixture of burnt smoke and rotten eggs clung to the air. The result of the firefight between my children the night before.

Not wanting to be in there longer than I had to be, I did what we came back to the house for. Stationing Rosie on the couch for another little power nap, I ran up to her room, being mindful of the leftover puddles and my water-damaged floors, to try and grab a fresh set of clothes. Unfortunately her closet hadn’t survived the fire. I sighed, my only other option being raiding Ben’s closet. Luckily, his clothes had stayed intact. I nabbed the first things I could find, taking a pair of black basketball shorts and a white shirt.

While upstairs, I also grabbed a change of clothes for myself from my closet and the iPad my kids shared- which, by the grace of God, had mostly charged before the power cut out. 

Back downstairs, I woke Rosie up and brought her into the bathroom to change and clean her up. She’d been wearing that damned damp and tattered witch costume all night. I hoped she hadn’t caught a cold while hiding out in that treehouse. 

To make things easier on myself, I let her play with the iPad as I stripped her down and used a couple water bottles to rinse the dirt and grime off her skin and hair. I dried and brushed her hair as she stared in the mirror, disapproving of the outfit choice. The shorts fit her well enough, reaching just past about half way down her shins, and the shirt was definitely loose. I just shrugged before helping her down from the sink counter she’d been sitting on, guiding her out of the bathroom. It was my turn to clean up.

My hair went up into a high ponytail after I washed my hands and face, then I changed into jeans and a plain black sweatshirt. Taking an Advil with that last little bit of water, I left the bathroom feeling as refreshed as one could be with the night I’d had.

Ready to face the world again, Rosie and I left the house. On the way over to Laurie’s porch, I spotted a decently sized rock and picked it up. It was just the thing I needed to initiate my plan to find out where Ben was taken. 

“Rosie, Mommy needs you to play with your iPad, okay?” I said, sitting my daughter down on Laurie’s porch step with her back facing the front door. She nodded in understanding, opening one of her favorite fashion games. 

Taking a deep breath, I pressed the doorbell. Fur Elise rang out as I tightened my grasp on the rock, keeping it concealed behind my back. A couple of nerve wracking seconds later, Laurie finally answered her door. “L-Lisa?” She asked, surprised to see me. “What are you doing-“

I cut her off, smashing the rock as hard as I could on her left temple. My rage levels had spiked off the charts. Just *looking* at her after everything that she’d caused was rage inducing. “How’s your jaw feeling, Laurie?”

Before she could respond, her eyes rolled to the back of her head as her body fell back on the floor with a loud, satisfying, thud. 

The game noises coming from Rosemary’s tablet suddenly stopped “Mommy?” She asked, concerned.

“Keep playing your game!” I whisper-yelled, dragging Laurie’s unconscious body further back into her house. 

\*\*\* 

Did you know that in the seven years we’ve been neighbors, I’ve never once been inside this woman’s house before?

And yes, it’s exactly like how a mad scientist’s house would be depicted in a movie or tv-show. Stacks on stacks of paper littered around every available corner. I couldn’t tell you what type of flooring she had due to the fact that every square inch of it was covered in manila folders, each having some kind of identifying chicken scratch on them. Laurie’s living room could’ve made it onto an episode of *Hoarders* with the amount of equipment and junk that had been piled up on her couch, coffee table, and around her tv stand. Though she’d turned the kitchen into some sort of makeshift lab, the only “inhabitable” area on the first floor seemed to be the adjacent dining room. A chill ran down my spine as I shuddered to think of what the upstairs looked like. 

After dragging my neighbor’s limp body through the hoarder house, I propped her up on one of the back table chairs. Laurie’s head lolled to the side, her tongue falling out of her mouth. The thought that she could be dead crossed my mind. She *was* on the older side and I *had* hit her pretty hard. Then a soft moan left her mouth, indicating that she was still alive. *Weekend at Bernie’s* style, I pushed her head straight up, her tongue retreating back into her mouth as I did so. 

Conveniently, a bundle of red nylon had been hanging off the back of another one of the table chairs. Unraveling it, I began tying Laurie down, starting with binding her wrists to the armrests then moving on to her ankles.  

“Mommy, can I come in yet?” Rosemary called from the front door impatiently, a bored expression displayed on her face as her iPad dangled by her knees. 

Turning away from the door, a light groan left my lips as I rubbed my eyes until stars enveloped my vision. “Give me just a second, sweetie,” I answered. 

After making sure Laurie’s bindings were secure, I drug a chair out of the dining room, placing it right outside the doorway on the living room side. After a quick check to make sure no military prowlers were roaming the streets looking to pick up any stray super children, I ushered my daughter inside the house and guided her to her seat.

From the dining room, Laurie began to stir. My heart started racing, it wouldn’t be long until she woke up. Not wanting Rosie to hear any of what was about to ensue, I dug my earbuds and phone out of my pockets, quickly opening my music app and pulling up the last playlist that was on before. Once the earbuds were in, Rosie happily started kicking her feet to the rhythm of T*he Offspring’s* “The Kids Aren’t Alright” while she continued to innocently play on her tablet.

I didn’t have time to change it from my playlist back to a kid friendly one, okay? At least she was facing away from our neighbor that I had tied up in the kitchen.

God, I’m a bad mother.

My attention turned back to the dining room. The noises coming out of Laurie’s mouth becoming more frequent, so I made a quick trip to the kitchen and filled up a random cup I’d found with cold tap water. 

Deciding to speed up the process, most of the water in the cup was dumped on to the mad scientist’s head and lap. 

“W-what?” Laurie asked breathlessly, looking around frantically as the icy water shocked her system awake. She soon discovered that I had tied her up, beginning to squirm and tug at her binds all while looking at me with wide, terrified eyes. All that movement had irritated her head wound, causing Laurie to wince in pain.

Narrowing my seething eyes, I splashed the leftover water in the cup at her, making sure to hit that angry looking cut on her temple. 

She cried out a strained, guttural groan, beginning to tremble something fierce. “P-please don’t hurt me! I’m- I’m about to become a very rich person,” she laughed out nervously. “What do you want? I can get you money, drugs, *power*, anything!” 

Fishing the rock from earlier out of my pocket, I began to toss it up and down catching it in the palm of my hand. Laurie’s eyes followed the object a couple times as confusion swirled within them. Then, I willed the chunk of Earth to stay in the air. Slowly turning my wrist to the left, the atoms and minerals that made up the stone separated, leaving behind tiny particles that twinkled as the dim light above the table reflected off of them. Flicking my wrist to the right returned the rock back to its original state. I then let the mass gently fall back into my palm. “No thanks, I already have power. I suppose I have you to thank for that, don’t I?” 

“Oh,” Laurie said. Her whole demeanor changed from that scared old lady that was pleading for her life just a moment ago to one of indifference. The act was up. “You ate a lollipop, didn’t you, Lisa?”

“Mhm,” I answered, crossing my arms into my chest. “So did my children, and as you can see, one of them is missing. Where’d they take my son, Laurie?”

The sudden military presence had Laurie’s scent all over it. 

She sighed, adjusting herself in her wet clothes. “Unfortunately, that’s the one thing I can’t give you.” 

“Bullshit,” I scoffed. “You’re not getting out of here until I do.”

Laurie took a second to mull it over. “Fine. See that radio over there?” She nodded her chin towards the end of the table where a small black radio sat across from me. I hadn’t noticed it there before. “Why don’t you come over here and give it to me? With one click of that red button, I can tell my men that you’re looking for your son. They can take you *right* to him.”

Involuntarily, my nose turned up at her in disgust. “Nice try, but I’m not an idiot.”

“Really?” My neighbor then bellowed out a deranged laugh, “because you were stupid enough to give your kids one of my lollipops!”

I saw red. Before I could think, my hand was gliding across the skin of her right cheek, leaving a satisfying burn on my palm. With how hard I’d smacked her, I must’ve given her a concussion, definitely a bruise that would take quite some time to heal. 

“You’re really going to do this?” Laurie asked, still giggling even after spitting out some blood. “With your daughter just in the other room? What kind of example are you setting for her?”

“What kind of example are you setting by giving *children* dangerous superpowers?” I snapped back angrily. Reacting to my emotions, the ground beneath us started to shake, causing the lights to sway and items all around the house to fall to the floor. 

Rosie yelped from the other room. The sound caused my heart to ache. Immediately the trembles stopped as I ran to check on my daughter. For the most part she was okay, just a little rattled up by the house shaking.

Something then clattered behind me. Returning to the dining room, I found Laurie still sitting in her chair. Her knuckles were white as she held onto the chair arms for dear life, looking at me like I could collapse the roof on her any minute. The best part was that, for the moment, she was silent.

I chalked the noise up to be another piece of loose debris and used this opportunity to make my point crystal clear, “Don’t you fucking worry about my kid. This is between you and me. Now, I’m going to ask you again, where is Ben?”

The silence only lasted for a minute before that grating voice of hers started up again. “All you need to know is that his life is now being dedicated to pursuing a better future for humanity.” 

I felt anger start to bubble up in my gut again. Then, a wicked smile spread on my lips as something interesting came to mind.

“Do you want to know what’s funny, Laurie?” I asked, closing my eyes, listening to the earth around us.

“What?” She indulged me.

The elements that made up our bodies hummed at the same frequency, singing an enchanting song only I could hear. With a deep concentration, I started sorting through the melody, searching for just the right note. “Fundamentally, us humans are all made from the same Earth. We all rely on the same minerals and vitamins to keep our bodies alive…”

My dear neighbor just looked at me, staring into my eyes to see if she could decipher what the hell I was getting at. With a snap of my fingers, it wouldn’t be too long until she figured it out.

Laurie suddenly doubled over as much as she could as an intensely painful sensation filled her side. She opened her mouth but only choked gasps managed to escape.

“Kidney stones are at the top of the list of the most painful conditions that a human being can experience. So you see with this ability of mine, I can make it so the minerals and salt in your kidneys crystallize in an instant… and I’m cooking up a good big one for you now!” 

“O-okay! Okay!” Laurie groaned out through gritted teeth, giving me one nasty scowl. “Enough…”

A delighted expression formed on my face, not expecting her to crumble that fast. I eased up on the kidney stone, “Ready to tell me where my son is now, bitch?”

Laurie then let out a throaty laugh. “Enough playing games. I’ve had my fun.”

Rosie screamed from the other room as the front door was suddenly kicked open. A soldier pointing an automatic rifle at my daughter burst through the door. The sound of glass shattering in the kitchen revealed another gunman had broken in from the back door. In an instant he had the barrel of the gun trained on me. Frantically, I looked for the radio that had been on the table. It was gone and we were surrounded.

“H-how?” I stammered out, trying to think of a way out of this. I tried to take a step back to my Rosie, but that resulted in both guns safety being switched off. 

“Oh neighbor, you’re not the only adult here who ate a lollipop!”

“*You!?!*”

Laurie scoffed. “Don’t sound so surprised, Lisa. I *am* a mad scientist after all. An even madder one now that I’ve developed an amplified intelligence!”

Now it was my turn to laugh, ruefully. “You experimented and risked your life, my *children’s* lives, f-for what?! The off chance you might’ve been granted a superpower. You’re absolutely insane!

“With science comes sacrifice,” was all she said, calmly. Too calm. She still had one more trick hidden under her sleeve. I could tell, it was a look Rosemary had given me many times when she was being naughty. 

”There was a reason I told you not to eat my candy,” Laurie began to explain, proving my point. “Through my experimentation I came to learn why children were the ideal candidates to ingest my serum. It all comes down to one simple reason, they would be the easiest to control, only developing one superpowered neural pathway. Adults on the other hand can and will develop multiple, which makes controlling and creating an army more difficult. If started off young we can break, train, and guide these children to become the best soldiers this planet has ever seen by adulthood.”

My knees went weak as I understood the weight of her words. Knowing now what she planned on doing to my kids and why they got one power while I got two.

If adults get more than one power, case in point, and Laurie already told me she got super smarts after taking that serum, then…

Suddenly, I was grabbed from behind, my wrists forced together as the back of my knee was kicked in. A hand forced my chin up. I saw Laurie looking down at me. Surprising, considering in my peripheral vision Laurie had still been tied down to that chair. 

Super smarts and cloning were Laurie’s powers?!? *Fucking seriously?*

Before I could try to use one of my abilities, a sharp stabbing pain came from my neck as she jabbed a long needle into a vein, injecting something into my bloodstream. 

Whatever it was started working fast. I got extremely light headed, the end of my vision filling with inky black. The hum of the Earth started to sound dissonant compared to the symphony it usually was. My body started to feel heavy and light at the same time as I tried to fight the drug. It was like falling down a never ending abyss. 

“Thank you for walking right into my trap, dear. I’ll have so much fun learning all about that other power you developed,” I heard Laurie whisper in my ear as my attempt to stay conscious began to fail. My eyes shut voluntarily as the sounds from the outside world began to dim. “Don’t worry Lisa, you’ll get to see both of your kids again, I’m not a *monster* after all.” 

\*\*\*

I woke up to a bright light humming to life and assaulting my eyelids. My eyes blinked open, slowly adjusting to the lights. Then my last memories came rushing in. 

Startled, I jerked upright, finding myself in a mind-numbingly white room. Squinting down, trying to prevent myself from going blind, I discovered the clothes I woke up in were not the ones I had gone to sleep in. My outfit consisted of a pair of white long pants with a matching short sleeved v-neck. The fabric felt like scrubs. Embroidered onto the right breast was a number. *111.* Most concerning of all was the leather collar strapped to my throat that wouldn’t come off. There seemed to be some type of device attached to it.

“Mom?” I heard suddenly.

My head turned at the sound of that voice. It was then that I found out all the walls were made out of a strong see-through material.

“Ben!” I cried, leaping to the wall that divided me from my son. In the middle were a couple of holes to let the air in and circulate. I poked a finger through to touch him, he touched me back. Tears welled up in my eyes. I didn’t think I’d ever see him again. He wore a similar outfit to mine, but with the number *110* instead. He also had that torture device strapped around his neck.

I looked to the right side of the room to find Rosie still asleep on her cot. She was in the same *uniform* as my son and I. “Rosie, baby, are you okay?” I asked her.

Rosemary shot up from her bed at the sound of my voice. “Mommy,” she sobbed, putting her hand up to mine from her side of the wall.

Laurie was right, I did get to see both my children again. The only downside seemed to be that we were locked in some kind of glass prison cell. 

A loud bang came from the other side of Ben’s room, interrupting my family’s bittersweet reunion. The cause of the disruptive noise came from none other than Jaime, who was also blind folded on top of having one of those collars around her neck too. “Would you keep it down, I’m trying to sleep!”

A pair of women’s heels suddenly sounded out, coming from down the hallway. Ben and Jaime immediately went rigid upon hearing whoever those footsteps belonged to.

The suspense grew as they got louder the closer they came to our cells. Rosie and I looked at each other nervously, not knowing what to expect. I did my best to give her a reassuring nod. “As long as we’re together, we can do anything,” I whispered to her. I looked at Ben and conveyed the same message. 

“109, 110,” A feminine voice acknowledged Ben and Jaime, passing them by.  A small, mousy woman then appeared in front of my cell. She wore dark brown pants that flared out at the bottoms, paired with a tan button up, all worn under a pristinely white lab coat. Her dirty blonde hair had been styled up in a bun, a few strands left loose to function as faux bangs. She carried a clipboard with her.
