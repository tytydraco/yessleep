“Sing along, Marty!” My mother called, her dress and matching bat mask swaying as she danced along with my father, the goat hooves of his costume clopping against the villages stone road, the sounds of them and the others all blending all together as the festival of the Sun Devourer went on, and my uncle grabbing my arm and pulling me into the crowd, dancing and singing alone to the jig. 

“Lassie, indulge your mother for once!” He said as I danced along with him, the ears of my hare mask swaying with my movements, but I didn't sing along, too busy trying to do the dance properly, and as the fake paws of his raccoon costume and the paws of my hare costume thumped against the ground, and as we danced and the people around us sang, we heard a young girl, no older than three, let out a blood curling scream as she flailed in the midst of the crowd, clawing at her skin as it began to bubble and ripple, thick black goop coming from her mouth, and she struggled to cough it up as it suffocated and drowned her, her sheep costume getting ruined by the inky bile.

No one reacted, we all kept dancing along, even her own parents ignoring her as they kept dancing despite her trying to call for help, her voice muffled as more filled her lungs, some drippings from her nose and her tear ducts, and after she began to turn blue, she passed away and fell to the ground, getting trampled as we all kept dancing, even as her blood and the black goop got on our costumes, we still danced, just to please our beloved God, Dravorran.

It wasn't till hours later, dawn on the horizon, when we finally stopped, folks laughing and trying to catch their breath, we finally noticed the poor, poor girl, nothing but a mushy mess of herself inside her lamb costume, something done by all of us without anyone noticing.


We held a close casket funeral later that evening, all of us in our nicest outfits as my uncle blessed the family, the girl’s body, and our village while the rest of us tried to figure out what was going to become if this incident got out to the rest or Ireland, or anyone else on this damn island that didn't believe in our god. Some spoke of a ‘prophecy’ about our God and how this was planned, others argued and shamed them for being so heartless towards the girl and her family, and I personally don't know what to think about it.



I would like to ask for advice for the situation because I'm worried more will die this way, and I can't get away since I have no money and I've never left our village. I know based on what I've read from our books, and what I could get on our village’s library computer that this has never happened before, so I still have no idea what I can do.

I apologize if this doesn't make much sense, my hands are shaking as I write this and my chest feels tight at the thought of how we danced on top of the girl and turned her into mush, like as if we were all foot trending. It doesn't help that I've never used a computer to write before and I only know how to use this website because someone visiting with a cell phone had shown me so we could message online. 

If you end up reading this, I miss you Mavie, please write back to me soon.
