*Snap.*

Overhead, the braided steel zipline cable gave as the Oak Walker strode forward, breaking the anchor bolt free of the tower with its broad wooden chest. The rusted metal line ripped a narrow path of destruction as it tore out of the tower room, smashing pedestals and scattering trinkets everywhere. With more wind pouring into the gouged-out tower, the flames leaped higher, feeding on the dry vines with a voracious appetite. The heat reached near-searing levels of intensity, and I dragged myself behind a scorched partition just to evade the flames.

“Jamie!” I coughed, nearly blinded by a billow of charcoal dust, and cringed as a section of the roof almost caved in on top of me. “Chris, where are you? I can’t see!”

*Boom.*

Underneath me, the tower shook, and I squinted into the night to feel my breath catch in both aching lungs.

Like a great mountain of twisted wood, the Oak Walker lumbered past my hiding spot, not thirty yards outside, each step corresponding with another burst of gunfire from the ground below. Bullets crashed into it from multiple directions, but even the heavy *boom-boom-boom* of a .50 caliber machine gun didn’t seem to make the beast so much as flinch. A screeching of steel told me one of our vehicles had met its end under the club-like foot of the Oak Walker, and despair rose in my throat. I hadn’t meant for this to happen; my intention was to set up the beacon, lure Vecitorak in close to it, and let the defensive high frequency emitter scramble him like a rotten egg. I’d figured once he died that any chance of resurrecting the Oak Walker would be gone, and I could then use the necklace to free Madison. Not for a moment had I considered the possibility that ‘freeing’ Madison meant killing her, and yet now that I sat in my little corner, I couldn’t help but seethe at my own naivete. She was dead, both body and soul, and it was all my fault.

*Oh Maddie, I’m so sorry, I didn’t know . . .*

Across the room, I caught a glimpse of Chris hoisting Jamie up so she could pull Tarren free of the vines, while Adam lay in a heap on the floor, his legs bent at odd angles. Tall flames kept us apart, but to my horror, I watched as Vecitorak turned from his perch in the wall to move closer to me.

I waited for his decayed flesh to burst into flame as before, but dark roots wriggled out from his various wounds and smothered the tongues of fire even as he walked through it. Like greasy snakes, the vines slithered over his torso to engulf the mutilated man, forming like armor around him in a manner not dissimilar to the Oak Walker’s organic hide. Out from his hand, Vecitorak wielded the dagger, and it glistened in the firelight as the crimson blood of a thousand lost souls oozed from the grain in a semi-sentient tide. With each step he took, it seemed the dull *thud* of another titanic stomp from the Oak Walker matched it, along with the eerie cheers of the Puppet horde outside. Behind it all, I caught a surge of hushed static that seemed to dwell within my ears, whispers that rose in my mind, a slow tide of chilling voices that clawed at my frantic thoughts with unwavering malice.

“You can hear it?” His words dripped with smugness, and Vecitorak grinned from behind a half-mask of vines as growth covered the mutilated side of his face. “Perhaps I was wrong about you; the Void’s call is not given to all, so there must be a greater purpose to your miserable life. Join me, Hannah. Join *us*, and see what power the Master will gift you for your obedience.”

*I have to get out of here.*

Struggling to rise on both shaky legs, I bolted into the smoke, the nightmarish figure hot on my heels. There wouldn’t be enough space in the burning room to evade him for long, but I couldn’t let him get near Chris or Jamie. I’d already failed to rescue Madison; I wasn’t about to lose my two best friends in the entire world to Vecitorak’s blade. If that meant playing a losing game of cat-and-mouse with this walking demon, then so be it.

I pivoted left and managed to turn to let off a burst from my submachine gun as I fled, but the rounds had as much effect as if I’d thrown a handful of pebbles. Striding after me with triumphant ease, Vecitorak barely flinched at the incoming lead, and smashed through partitions of vines or walked over flames as if they weren’t there.

“To have come all this way.” Unphased by the chase, he tracked me through the clouds of fiery ash, Vecitorak strengthened by the Oak Walker’s rise to an invincible degree. “Only to hide in the dark from your true potential . . . what a waste. Come with me, and together we will—”

*Bang.*

A gun barked in the shadows, and Vecitorak’s head twitched in the shock of a speeding bullet. Like before, it had little effect, but it made the vine-encrusted fiend pause and turn his masked head in annoyance.

Chris stood beyond the tide of fire, watching me in desperation over the sights of his Mauser pistol. On his right shoulder he supported Adam, whose broken legs dragged over the floor, while Jamie held Tarren’s unconscious form in her arms next to Chris. I could see in their pale expressions that both wanted to rush to my aid, but the heat was too intense. At this rate, if either tried to come after me, it would mean not only their death, but the death of whoever rested on their arm. Still, I knew that wouldn’t stop them from trying.

*No. I won’t have more dead people on my conscience. No more.*

In md panic, I cast around the soot-covered room with my eyes and caught sight of the groaning ceiling shift above me. My enhanced senses kicked in at last, and I picked out the other spots in the room where more sections did the same, many of the support already torn to bits by Vecitorak’s rampage. The high winds outside clawed at the teetering structure, and I figured there had to be enough metal and wood above me to do the job.

“Get out!” With a curt wave to Chris, I darted around a stack of wooden boxes that were turning black in the inferno and avoided a swing from Vecitorak’s knife. “Take Tarren and go!”

*Crash.*

The heavy blow landed instead on a nearby partition of growth and sent it crumbling into broken shards of dried out husks.

“You can make it!” Chris tried to keep the front blade of his antique handgun on Vecitorak’s head, but the arcane mutant was too quick, almost keeping pace with me in the dark. “Jump across, come on!”

*Thud.*

Another jackhammer of a strike missed me by inches and pulverized one of the old concrete support sections of the original tower room.

“It’s too hot!” I dodged falling chunks of cement and fought to breathe in the suffocating atmosphere of dust, smoke, and flame. “We can’t leave the others here. Go, I’ll be fine!”

Chris opened his mouth to shout a contradiction, but a dull *crunch* cut him off, and I looked up in time to watch the tower roof give out.

With most of its beams demolished, the celling tumbled down around me in a rain of burned wood, rusted metal, and cracked cement. Some of the flames were smothered by the falling debris, and the rain poured down from the gray clouds to quench more of it, but the sudden influx of fresh oxygen outpaced it all. In a great *whoosh,* a sea of red flames and black smoke boiled into the sky, and the heavy wind fed it like a furnace blower. Shrapnel beat me all over, but a large slab of concrete buried Vecitorak, while Chris and the others fell backward as the floor under them buckled. To my horror, they careened down into the staircase below and were hidden from my sight.

*Smack.*

A red-hot piece of broken metal glanced off the side of my head, and I dropped to the floor to curl into a ball, bracing myself for the unavoidable pain of being crushed.

Fire crackled, the rubble clattered to a halt, but all went still in the icy onslaught of rain.

*No way that should have worked.*

I blinked, opening my eyes to find myself half-buried in dried vines, a twisted piece of sheet metal, and a few heavier bits of cement. Flames leapt across the heaped-up growth across the tower’s surface, but for the moment I was alone on a tall island in a sea of night.

Each breath hurt, and I tasted coppery blood on my lips, but I dragged myself out from under the junk to peer down at the ground below. Tracers zipped across the marshy field, the combined ELSAR and coalition troops putting up a fierce fight, but it was no use. Wave after wave of flitting shadows hurled themselves into the machine gun fire, unending, unafraid, with a single-minded drive to conquer. Over them all stood the Oak Walker, its mighty feet crushing anyone who got in its path, and the bark-like hide sealed over the bullets holes as fast as they were punched into it.

Exhausted, I sat back on my heels and gulped down a fresh breath of the cool night air, hunched behind the wide piece of sheet metal to hide from the searing heat. My toes poked out over the edge, and I felt defeat creeping into my mind, as I stared down into the carnage.

*I can’t get down, they can’t get out; we’ve lost, we lost everything. My fault. It’s all my fault.*

Behind me, the bent sheet metal creaked, and I scarcely had a moment to turn before a clammy hand yanked me off the ground by the steel collar of my cuirass.

*Thunk.*

A hard jab hit me in the ribs, but the steel of my armor turned the wooden point of his dagger as Vecitorak jabbed at me in a blind fury.

“*Fool!*” He rammed the oaken dagger into my stomach, the blade catching the overlapping plates of metal again, but it knocked the wind out of me as I hung suspended over the yawning expanse. “I offered you power, a place by my side, *eternal life*, but you threw it all away!”

*Wham.*

Another strike rang off my shoulder pauldron, Vecitorak getting closer to finding a soft spot in my armor by the moment. I couldn’t breathe, between his attack and my armor choking me, and gripped his decayed wrist with terror as my boots kicked in the air. Sooner or later, he’d give up and plunge it into my head, and I figured the only reason he hadn’t so far was either due to shock at the destruction of his tower, or the desire to keep me alive as he slowly turned me into a mindless Puppet. If he relaxed his grip, even for a second, I would fall at least thirty feet to the ground below. No one could survive a fall like that, not even with the mutations of the Breach.

Groping for my war belt, I tried to pull my pistol from its holster, but Vecitorak saw through the attempt, and spun on his heel to toss me into a nearby pile of debris atop the tower.

*Whump.*

Pain flared in my limbs as I bounced and rolled, coming to a stop far too close to the edge of the tower’s ruined peak. Greedy tongues of fire licked at my pantlegs, my throat burned from being constricted, and I gritted my teeth as I forced myself to roll over. Vecitorak advance on me, his knife held at the ready, and this time, I sensed that he wouldn’t make the mistake of hitting my armor.

With deep breaths Vecitorak seemed to collect himself and pressed one foot down over my left ankle to keep me from crawling away. “You don’t understand. Your kind never do. He will claim you all the same, along with the rest of those who followed you here, to their deaths. Like that little girl, they can struggle, but in the end, all light succumbs to the Void. This is for the best, Hannah. If you had seen what I’ve seen . . .”

Pinned by his foot, I managed to palm my handgun and steeled my frayed nerves for what would come next. He was going to destroy me, violate my soul in a way unimaginable to the human mind, exterminate my very consciousness as he kept my physical body as his slave. Perhaps he was right; perhaps there never had been a chance of victory, not for us. In that knowledge, a small part of me wondered if I wouldn’t be better off pressing the barrel to my own head.

*But I don’t want to die, not now, not like this . . .*

Thumbing back the hammer on the Mauser, I drew it from the leather holster, my heart pounding in dread.

*Snap.*

Vecitorak jerked to a halt with a grunt and looked down to see a long bit of shining steel poking out of his chest.

From behind him, a limping figure ripped the cutlass free, and two bloodshot eyes glared at the shadowy mutant. “*Where is she?*”

For once, Vecitorak seemed just as surprised as I was to see another person in the ruins of the tower. Grapeshot looked even worse than our previous meeting, his clothes spattered with blood, fresh cuts raked across his body from Peter’s sword. His right cheek had been cleaved to the bone, one finger was missing on his left hand, and the captain’s right leg dripped a steady trail of crimson as he limped on it, indicative of where his opponent’s blade had struck home. Despite all this, he remained upright, as if driven on by pure spite and determination, a sight that made my intestines churn.

If he was here . . . where was Peter?

Shaking himself out of his stupor, Vecitorak lunged at the pirate, but Captain Grapeshot ducked his attack and drove the point of his cutlass into the priest’s knee. This tore enough of the vines to slow the mold king down, and as their combat intensified, I dragged myself away from the tower edge.

As I fumbled to yank my Type 9 from where it had bundled up on my back I circled around the piles of rubble, and my elbow hit the assault pack that slumped across my shoulder blades.

*Wait a minute . . . there’s an idea.*

Nearby flames burned so hot they made the edges of my uniform curl, but I peeked at the captain and Vecitorak from my place of cover and watched them continue to slice and jab at each other in a whirlwind of violence. This could be the only break I ever got even if I’d failed to rescue Madison, but if this worked, I could still carry out my mission. ELSAR could activate the beacon system, seal the Breach, and the Oak Walker would just have to find another tear in reality to haunt. Yes, this was still doable; I just had to act fast.

Slipping the pack from my shoulders, I holstered my pistol with trembling hands and pawed at the black plastic case inside. Out came the square yellow beacon, and underneath, I ripped up the foam liner to reveal a silver metal tripod with a spring-release catch to one side. Retractable spikes on the feet seemed to work as anchors if I could find suitable ground for them, and as I screwed the tripod to the underside of the beacon, I remembered what Colonel Riken had said.

*‘Do not push the button before deploying the tripod; it will automatically activate in five seconds, and you’ll get fried.’*

Not far off, the titanic silhouette of the Oak Walker lumbered through the battlefield, still assailed by rifle fire on every side. In the flickers of lightning from the storm overhead, I saw again its bark-like hide, the twigs of its crown, and heard the faint chorus of a thousand whispers hissing in my ears. These seemed to correspond with its deep, baleen roar, and I noted how the Puppets on the ground followed it like a flock of birds flying in sync.

In my head, a switch threw itself, and I found myself back in that clinic with Jamie and Dr. O’Brian standing over me.

*‘A psy-organic . . . one of the most powerful mutants types there are . . . and you brought one down . . .’*

My gaze fell to the beacon, hope rekindled in my chest, and I whispered the words to myself as though they were a magical incantation. “. . . with a doggy beeper.”

*Clang.*

The clatter of steel brought me out of my thoughts, and I swiveled my head around to see Vecitorak break Captain Grapeshot’s cutlass in half with one clenched fist.

Weeping streams of blood down the arm of its bearer, Vecitorak’s wooden blade arched downward in a blur.

Grapeshot gasped in pain, even as Vecitorak lifted him up by the knife itself, the weapon gouged deep into the pirate’s ribs. I watched in horror as the vines spread out over the boy’s torso, under his skin, and consumed him. Flesh popped, muscles squelched, and blood ran red over the squirming growth to pool on the rubble beneath Grapeshot’s boots. Layer by layer the oily roots coiled around him like a snake, starting at his legs and working their way up in a hungry march of purposeful agony.

Frozen in his torment, the boy’s eyes flicked to me, and something in Grapeshot’s face softened. For a brief moment, the old him shone through, the last vestiges of Samual Roberts surfacing from the mask he’d worn for so long, and he granted me a stiff nod.

“Tarren.” He rasped and raised his one good arm between Vecitorak and himself to keep it above the rising tide of vines. “Get her out.”

I spotted the olive-drab object in his pale grasp before Vecitorak did, and dove to the ground behind the nearest pile of broken concrete.

*Ka-boom.*

They flew away from each other, the two men shredded from their bodies as the grenade rocked the tower. Vecitorak’s charred form toppled into a nearby heap of bent steel I-beams, while Captain Grapeshot’s lifeless body tumbled away over the side, down into the darkness. My ears rang from the detonation, the sodden clothes on my back whipped in the shockwave, but the smoke hadn’t even cleared before I saw it.

An enormous, humanoid form, headed right for the tower.

*We’ve got its attention now.*

Amidst the dying flames and pouring rain, I stood up from the rubble, my heart racing. Chris and Jamie were trapped under the debris somewhere nearby, and if they could have seen me, they would have done everything in their power to stop what I was about to do. Vecitorak grunted and groaned in the nearby rubble, his mutilated husk slowly pulling itself back together through the sheer power of the Breach’s gifts, but I still had a good thirty second head-start on him. There was no one left to help me now, no one between me and my destiny, and though I was afraid, I knew I couldn’t run away anymore.

“Here!” Long strands of wet hair clung to the side of my face as I sucked in a deep breath and faced the oncoming nightmare. “I’m right here!”

Through the gloom it descended, leaning down to inspect me, and my limbs froze in place as the whispers in my head screamed with an accompanying rush of static. The Oak Walker was truly massive, no more than fifteen yards away now, its face level with me as it peered down at the destroyed tower. No features adorned its visage; no nose, eyes, or mouth, merely a smooth surface of interwoven vines that wrapped around its triangular head. Yet through this wall of slow-moving growth, a voice whispered into my subconscious, deep and inhuman, yet with more force than even the Leviathan of Maple Lake had shown. Multiple pitches resonated within the words, a million different tones, as if a multitude of trapped souls chanted in unison.

*“You go to your death.”*

Fighting the paralyzing fear with every fiber of my being, I readied my thumb on the beacon’s green activation button. I had to break Colonel Riken’s most important rule at just the right time, and if I misjudged a single step, it would all be for nothing.

*“You do not understand.”*

A wave of visions not my own flooded my mind like a blinding storm, and I had to wade through them to regain control of myself. Screams of wounded men wavered over the echoes of distant artillery. Blood stuck to my hands, thick and hot. A field of bodies stretched on before, piled in twisted slumps, the smoke of battle floating over their torn faces as the guns continued to roar. A large, mushroom-shaped cloud roiled on the horizon and the trees caught fire, the sky itself turning blood red as the vision reached its crescendo.

*“You are a curse.”* The Oak Walker’s voice called from beyond the sight, lulled me forward, but I resisted it like a wild animal to hold my ground. *“A blight on the perfection of rot, growth, and sprout. I can save you.”*

Shutting my eyes, I concentrated with all my might to summon *the focus* and pushed the foreign tendrils from my consciousness.

For a split second I saw the stranger in the yellow chemical suit, his golden lantern held out to pierce through the Oak Walker’s visions with shining rays of light, illuminating the way out.

Without any other choice, I ran to him, and the instant my foot crossed over to the path of light, my eyes flew open.

Gargantuan hands of birch bark reached for me in the icy rain, and out of the corner of my eye, I caught Vecitorak stumble upright as his body reformed from the vines.

“No.” The dark priest croaked, as if sensing my plan, and shambled toward me with one arm outstretched in a manic plea.

My boots flew under me, over a grimy steel beam that protruded from the burning heap like a ramp, and I threw myself at the edge of the tower.

Sweeping some of the wreckage into the air by their speed, the Oak Walker’s hands passed by me on either side, too slow to prevent my charge.

At last, the cement ran out, and with a breathless shout of exertion, I hurled myself into the expanse between us.

Time seemed to slow, the air rushed by, whispers begging in my head for me to submit but I shut them out. Instead, I let the old memories parade through my mind one last time: Jamie’s laugh, Chris’s handsome smile, the sunrise at New Wilderness. So many things I would miss, so many things I would never do again. All the same, for the smallest of moments I had them back, and basked in the coziness of those happy memories.

*This is for my friends.*

Mid-air, I pressed my thumb down on the green activation button, and the countdown started.

*Beep.*

Somewhere over my shoulder, the still-reforming body of Vecitorak lunged off the tower after me and clawed at the air next to my heels, desperate to stop my flight.

*Beep.*

My arms gripped the beacon tripod high over my head like a two-handed spear, and gray bark-like hide hurtled up at me.

*Crack.*

The sharp spikes at the end of the tripod burrowed deep into the face of the Oak Walker, and searing torment flared in my fingers as I swung by the tenuous hold.

*Beep.*

I slammed against the mutant’s dense skin, nearly losing my grip as the massive mutant reared back with surprise, and the world around me blurred with the motion.

*Beep.*

Falling short on his own jump, Vecitorak latched onto the Oak Walker’s chin somewhere below me, and I heard his sharp fingers dig into his Master’s hide.

*Beep-Beep-Beep.*

At the last three tones, an eruption of static howled in my brain, and a fierce vibration rippled through my arms. My eyes swam with tears, the sensation as cruel as a thousand knife blades, and my skin crawled as if it were melting off my bones. I couldn’t help but scream at the top of my lungs, and the fingers of my hands gave out as every muscle in my body spasmed in seizure.

Down I fell, and the world moved by in a shutter-stop parade. Overhead, the Oak Walker bellowed as its enormous crown split in two, chunks of vine wriggling off the beast as it disintegrated. Vecitorak screeched in his descent towards the ground, vicious black roots overwhelming him much as they had his victims until he was smothered in the mass. Trees cracked, the ground below seemed to slide as if fluid, and the clouds above formed a whirlpool spiral around themselves. Lightning brighter than any I’d ever seen cut apart the storm in a single white bolt, the entire cursed place lit up for one final moment.

At the apex of the bolt my tear-strewn eyes discerned a shape, one barely perceptible beyond the thin veil of this reality; a golden door, held open in the clouds, from which brilliant gouts of light poured in a way that tugged something loose in my chest.

Just as the tugs managed to pull free of whatever held them inside, the ground rose to meet me, and I collapsed into the blackness of complete oblivion.
