Back home, we used to live in small clusters, communities centered around two to three pairs of breeders. Strays and relatives would form a group with these families to give and receive protection, food and company. One clan would amount to fifteen to twenty individuals, thirty at most. That kind of behavior would suggest that we viewed other groups as enemies, but hostility was, in fact, rare. Otherwise, my species would have most likely not endured long enough to populate the majority of the… planet? The space we inhabited, at any rate. I have no idea how big my dimension truly was. Perhaps it spanned a whole universe, like this one. Or maybe it was cramped by comparison, like the place with the staircase. 

I was never a breeder. Creating larvae did not appeal to me. I accompanied a pack with three pairs of breeders, hunting and scouting for them while eating from their share and living on their turf. Romantic partnership didn’t exist among us, not in the way humans define it. Any two individuals could biologically create offspring between one another. It was a lot more uncomplicated than it is here on earth, the emotional aspect included. At home, breeders found themselves based on prowess, respect and esteem. There was appreciation involved, but mostly assurance and confidence. The ability to feed, provide and shelter. Human love seems to be much more rooted in tenderness and care.

That’s what I thought about when I was sitting in Frankie’s car, staring at its owner who was occupying the driver’s seat. *What a distinctly human emotion I had developed.* I stroked the edge of the notebook in my lap. Having retrieved the item from Jewel’s old room, we were on our way to Mary Markov. 

“Penny for your thoughts,” Fran said.

“Jewel was a breeder,” I replied. “On Raek-Vi’ir.”

“Don’t worry about that freak, Sunshine. They’re the agency’s problem now.”

“I know.”

“We should focus on breaking the signal.”

“I know.”

“That’s what matters now. And we’re pretty damn close, so all this shit is gonna be over soon.”

“I know,” I repeated, opening the notebook again. It didn’t say much, at least nothing coherent. There were names and addresses in there, though; lots of them. I wondered how many of them were still alive, but I would leave that to Mary Markov to find out. The coordinates were on one of the last pages written on, rather closer to the end of the book. The rest of the space was filled with a bunch of drawings. They were of nothing earthly or fathomable, just odd shapes and scribbles, but some of them looked strikingly similar to Jewel’s true form. Smaller though, with bigger heads, shorter tails and larger eyes. *Younger.*

“You think that’s what drove them crazy?” Fran asked after emitting a small sound of defeat. “The loss of their children?”

“Maybe. Back in my world, breeders would have died to protect theirs.”

“Ugh, I know. In this world, too. I don’t know what it is with parenthood. It does stuff to people’s heads I don’t care to explore.”

“You seem to enjoy Rhonda and the others pampering you,” I pointed out.

“I like feeling cared for. That’s different, though. Humans overthink it. So you made more of yourself, big deal. It’s not like this planet is already overloaded with them.” He scoffed, drumming an impatient rhythm on the steering wheel and glaring at the slow driver ahead of us. 

“I don’t want to be a parent either—”

“That’s good,” Frankie interrupted, pointing at his crotch, “because I’m *pretty sure* I’m infertile.”

I smiled, reached over and patted his arm. “—but I think the concept in itself is rather… *sweet*. I don’t understand the need from a personal perspective, but I daydream about being raised by human breeders sometimes.”

“Cute,” he said very, very softly. I sank back into my seat, crossing my arms despite not actually being offended. A little while later, we pulled up outside of Nettie Peterson’s house where Mary Markov’s truck was parked, its owner awaiting us inside. 

“You’re sure you can’t come?”

Fran shook his head, curls bouncing. “I need to get back to the diner, at least for the rest of the day.”

“Why did you start working there anyways? You keep saying you have enough FunFlair money to live comfortably.”

“I do, but I just… oh well.” He shrugged.

I grinned. “It’s because you want to help your moms, isn’t it?”

“Pff.”

“For an allegedly bloodthirsty Ancient, you’re rather gentle,” I remarked, grin widening. “*Soft-hearted.*”

“Oh shush.” He waved a hand at me like he was chasing away a fly. “You. You have a stupidly bright smile. I know you’re mocking me, but you’re so… sunny.”

I laughed.

He leaned over to unbuckle my seatbelt. “Anyways, good look with Markov and the heads. Keep me updated.”

I assured him I would and then, just before he pulled away, I drew close and pressed my lips to his. I hadn’t contemplated the action at all. It was purely out of instinct. He didn’t squeak, didn’t pull away, didn’t start. He stared at me for several seconds, and that’s when I realized what I’d done. 

“Oh. *Oh.* I’m so sorry.”

“Wow,” he said at length. “So we’ve gone from a greasy diner after hours to a car. Not the upgrade I’d been meaning to provide.” He paused, then removed his piece of gum from his mouth and tucked it behind his ear. “Eh, might as well. Close your eyes. It’s way better if you close your eyes.”

“But I want to keep looking at you.”

Sighing, he carefully covered my eyes with his palm, his smooth skin tickling my lashes as the world turned black. Thus blinded, I felt his mouth on mine once more, firm but balmy. He drew away after two seconds, removing his hand from my face and looking entirely too smug. 

“That felt really, really nice,” I said.

“Just nice?”


I fumbled for a more fitting adjective but my higher faculties had seemingly abandoned me. Frankie, noting this, appeared pleased. “Yeah, okay. I *accept*. Now get out, I gotta go make money and you gotta go play with severed heads a little.”

I reluctantly climbed out of the car, only to see Nettie hastily withdraw from where she’d been pressed up against one of the windows when I started walking towards the house. It was Kit Sutton who opened the door for me, wheedling me inside. “Did you get it?”

I held up the notebook.

“Great! Oh, I can’t believe we’re actually doing this.” She was bouncing on her heels, pulling on the hem of a familiar-looking sweater. Nettie had apparently returned it to her.

“Are you coming?” I inquired.

“Actually, no. But Nettie wants to, and Ms Markov says she can.”

Thus summoned, the newsreader appeared before us in the hallway. She was quick to snatch the notebook from me, skimming through the pages with nervously trembling fingers. “Oh thank God,” she breathed out, apparently reaching the part with the coordinates. “I was worried they were tricking us again. Let’s hope this leads us where we’re hoping it will.” She flitted off into one of the other rooms to make some phone calls, sending her personnel to retrieve the heads for us. She stayed with the three of us until receiving word back from her staff a while later. They had located and unearthed the crate suspected to contain the beacon, and it was being transported back to the agency building that also held her office. We would take care of it from there, although I admittedly had no idea what “taking care of it” would entail. The newsreader couldn’t answer me this question either, saying that we would have to take things one at a time and begin with examining this *special treasure*.

Nettie exhibited a nervous curiosity in the proceedings, wishing to be present for the box to be opened. I could readily understand her emotional investment, and seeing as I would be there anyways, I figured it’d be great to have her there, be it only for moral support. Thus, the three of us drove over to Mary’s workplace, where a room had been set aside for the crate. To our collective surprise, we found that the door to said room was being crowded by several staff members, all visibly distressed. When the newsreader asked what was going on, one of them, a young-ish woman in a pencil skirt, came forward, her features creased by a deep frown.

“Will already went in there to break the locks open and now he won’t come back out,” she explained. “He’s acting really strange.”

Mary Markov let out a frustrated groan as she reached out to open the door. I was unsure of what she’d expected after this rather vague warning, but it certainly wasn’t what we saw when we stepped inside. Nettie’s hands instantly came up to grip my arm. The room was small and square, with nothing but a single little table in the middle. Resting on top of it was a crate of the same size as the last one Eli and I had guarded, several heavy-looking locks lying discarded on the floor beneath. Kneeling in front of the table like he was cowering before an altar was a large man—Will, I assumed. His toolbox was sitting beside him, but he wasn’t busying himself with it anymore. He didn’t even acknowledge us as we walked in. 

His shoulders were trembling with silent, toneless sobs. I cautiously stepped around the table to regard his front. His eyes were wide and unblinking, his mouth shut, his lower lip pushed out and quivering. It looked beyond strange. 

“Will?” Mary asked, motioning for Nettie to shut the door as she moved a little closer to him. Her hand hovered above his upper arm, and she threw me an uncertain glance. I gave her a shrug and she slowly, ever so slowly, lowered her fingers to meet with his sleeve. The second she made contact, sharp, shrill laughter sliced through the silence. Nettie jumped, and Mary immediately withdrew from her coworker. From across the table, I could only look on in horror. 

Will’s jaw had dropped, and from deep within his throat, this awful, garbled sound rang out. He wasn’t *actually* laughing, there was no movement of the mouth involved. The noises were coming out of his chest, emerging from between his parted, stiff, rigidly open lips. His arms were frozen in position, clenched fists twisting the neck of his shirt. 

"Oh God…" Nettie's eyes danced across the room, flitting between Mary and myself. "What's happening to him?"

"We need to get him out of here," Mary replied, her voice firm despite the way her brows furrowed. She stepped close once again, extending her arms to pick him up, but he didn't budge. Her pulls and tugs amounted to nothing as Will remained still as a statue, the chilling laughter never ceasing. Nettie was covering her ears with her palms, fear pulling her mouth into a clenched-teeth snarl. "Should we get help from the others? Security or something?" she pressed out, raising her voice over the chaotic noise with some difficulty. 

"We don't know how they'll react to the beacon," Mary shouted. Will's uncontrolled laughter was getting louder and louder by the second, morphing into hacked, gasping screams. 

"It's just because he's been in here so long!" Nettie yelled back. “Else we’d already be losing it, too!”

She had a point. Mary Markov apparently agreed since she gestured for Nettie to go get help. As soon as my savior human had slipped outside however, Will’s cowering form sprang to life. It happened completely out of the blue. Without a warning, he shot up from his spot on the floor, threw his arms around Mary and shoved her to the ground, sprawling on top of her. A scream died in the agent's throat as the back of her head connected with the floor, the dull thud making my stomach turn. She was still alive, though, still conscious, and my heart leapt with relief when I saw her raise her hands to shield her face. They grappled for a mere second before Will managed to wrap his hands around her neck. 

Not wasting any more time, I unfurled my tentacles and bared my teeth, lunging at the fighting pair. I tried to pry Will away from her with all limbs available, but he resisted with a strength I can only describe as superhuman. I had wrapped my tentacles around his chest and shoulders from behind, hanging on with all my might as I felt his muscles strain and coil in my grasp. After several excruciating moments, the man’s arms gave in and he let go. The air leaving my body in a loud grunt, I hurled him square across the room and he slammed into the far wall—I heard the crack of breaking bones before he crumbled to the floor. The sound sent chills down my spine, a small sting of guilt penetrating my chest.

Mary Markov had collected herself to some extent, laboriously pushing herself into a sitting position and cradling her throat when I rushed to her side. I helped her to her feet, one hand steady between her shoulder blades and the other on her arm. “Can you breathe?”

“Yes… yes, I’m alright. Thank you.” Her voice was rough and brittle, and she had to swallow twice before speaking up again. “Is Will alive?”

I glanced over to where he’d fallen only to freeze when I realized he wasn’t there anymore. The newsreader’s hand, formerly having rested on my shoulder for support, clamped down, her nails digging into my skin beneath the bunched up fabric of my shirt. Following her gaze, I tipped my head back to look at the ceiling. 

Will had somehow climbed up into the upper right corner of the room, holding himself in this unnatural position as he stared down at us. The skin of his face had turned bright red, and his eyes were practically bulging out of his head. Pushing himself off with his arms and legs, he flung himself down on us. Mary let out an ear-piercing shriek and jumped back while I managed to raise my tentacles just in time to break his fall. I staggered back as the impact of his entire weight surged through me, but I stayed on my feet, wrapping my extra limbs around his thrashing, writhing form. He was howling and screaming like a creature of myth, but thankfully, I didn’t have to keep him still for long. 

A mere moment later, the door burst open and four burly security guards came storming in, closely followed by my savior human. They helped lower Will to the ground, then quickly carried him outside. Nettie Peterson, Mary and I trailed after them, the newsreader slumping against the wall outside, her breathing shallow with shock and exhaustion. I was slowly retracting my fangs and extra limbs.

“I’m sorry,” Mary muttered. “I had hoped this would be… easier…”


“What happened in there? That guy Will, was he possessed or something?” Nettie inquired, raking a hand through her curls.

“You could say that. I was expecting complications due to the residue energy, but I had no idea what shape they would come in.” The newsreader arched and straightened her back, producing a painful cracking sound. “It’s like I said, dimension hoppers are remarkable, Miss Shirley here being the third I’ve met in person. Most jump reluctantly, it’s out of their control. There’s not much known about this ability, only that it occurs in beings from all kinds of dimensions. It’s also been reported in humans before. Apparently, this power, if you can call it that, entails the capacity to reshape the individuals’ bodies into something more fit to the dimension they end up in. Some retain aspects of their previous form that may appear at random, but most don’t.”

“Eva can control her tentacles,” Nettie chimed in. “Ever since she’s been using them a lot, she’s been getting really good at it. She can jump dimensions at will, too.” There was a hint of pride in her tone as she regarded me with warm eyes.

“Nettie practiced with me,” I explained. “She figured out how.”

Mary Markov glanced between the two of us. “Well, I have known for a while that Miss Shirley’s strengths exceed those of most other inter-dimensionals. Either way, all of them are beings of unbridled, raw energy, and when a creature such as that is killed, some part of that energy stays behind. Jewel has somehow managed to bend it in their will, making the heads call out to that black hole-thing.”

“They’re not still alive, are they?” Nettie’s highly expressive brows rising as her eyes grew wide beneath their lime green lids.

“I’m afraid to say that they most likely do retain some semblance of awareness,” Mary confessed, watching regretfully as Nettie covered her mouth with her palm. Hoping that the cold from my fingers seeping into her skin would provide some comfort, I pressed them to the side of her face.

“They don’t know who they are or what exactly is going on around them, mind you,” Mary assured us. “It’s just the remains of their former power in those heads now. They’re probably scared and confused, and acting out of that fear. Think of it like a poltergeist haunting.”

“Yeah, because I definitely have a lot of experience with those,” my best friend replied with a strained chuckle. “If they’re like some kind of ghost, isn’t all we need to do to lay them to rest somehow?” 

Mary looked skeptical. “I doubt a simple burial could achieve that.”

“We do need to calm them down somehow,” I thought aloud.

“And how?”

“Oh, I didn’t have any particular ideas,” I admitted. “But we could always turn to witchcraft.”

So I made my way back to Tom's Diner to see Rhonda. And somewhere in a prison block, Jewel pretends to have a panic attack and requests to take in their meal alone.
