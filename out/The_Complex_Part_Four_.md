[Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1efxwow/the_complex_part_three/)

Is it really Hell if it's where we belong?

A woman steps out of the elevator. She appears to be in her early to mid twenties and has a relatively short stature. She's wearing a loose-fitting, light-blue T-shirt with a pattern of a large, white sunflower printed on the front, along with a pair of tan cargo shorts, and some pink flip-flops. Her hair was a dirty blonde that hovered about a quarter of an inch above her shoulders, and presented on her face was a pair of thick, black-rimmed glasses. She stumbled out of the elevator with a cautious confusion that I've grown all too familiar with myself. She begins to make note of several of the same things I did earlier, including the clock that once again read 12:18. She makes a quick glance in my direction before nearly jumping out of her skin. Obviously, she wasn't expecting me, which tells me that this might not be her first dream either.

I gently let go of the knob, and turn away from the Hell Door. I slowly make my way over to her, making as few unnecessary movements as possible while also trying to indicate that I'm not a threat. I quickly glance over my shoulder back to the door only to find it, once again, gone. Once I'm within speaking distance to her, I notice that she is significantly shorter than I am. She glances up at me and appears to be shaking while trying to maintain a brave face. The closer I get to her, the more I can feel my stomach sink. I know this woman. In fact, I'm almost certain that I saw her only a few minutes ago. She is one of the people from the many, many portraits I've seen. In fact, she was one of five displayed on the calendar labeled "The Founders." I didn't like the sound of that.

"Who are you?" She asked, her voice shaking.

"I'm just a guest here, same as you." I answered plainly.

"No. I mean, what's your name?"

I hesitate for a moment, thinking about how I should answer her. After a moment, my brow furrows. She could see that I was becoming nervous, and took a few steps backward.

"Why don't you tell me your name first?" I ask her.

She tilts her head slightly, almost like a puppy who doesn't understand their owner's behavior. Her eyes widen as she begins to understand what I'm getting at.

"I... I don't know." The anxiety and confusion in her voice is becoming more noticeable.

"Me neither." I couldn't help but notice the defeat in my voice.

"What is this place? What's going on?"

"Deep breaths, Sunny. Do you remember how you got here?"

"Sunny? Is that my name? How could you know that?"

"I don't. I just figured nicknames would be useful right about now. I saw the sunflower on your shirt, and... you know."

"Oh. Right. Sorry. What should I call you, then? Hoodie? Jeans?"

I let out an audible sigh before regretting it immediately. Sunny is very obviously the socially awkward type, and we're in an incredibly stressful situation. I look down at the clothes I'm wearing. It never crossed my mind before, but it's the exact same outfit as I've worn in the other two setting, and most definitely not what I fell asleep in. At least, I don't think it is. It's hard to remember exactly. Grey hoodie, blue t-shirt, blue jeans, and black and white sneakers. I believe that these are clothes that I do own, but very much a casual type of outfit that you'd wear when meeting up with friends.

"Grey, I guess. Best to keep things simple."

"Okay, Grey. What was it you asked me? How I got here?"

"That's right. Do you remember how you got here?"

"No. When I came to, I was in an elevator. I don't remember this building, and I don't remember driving here."

"What kind of car do you drive?" I asked because an unsettling thought began creeping in my head.

"I, uhhhh... I don't remember exactly, but I think it was a blue sedan? Why does that matter?"

"It doesn't really. I guess I'm just making small talk." I felt a sudden and strange mix of satisfaction and pity as my suspicion was confirmed. I did indeed see a blue sedan in the parking lot, but I wasn't about to tell her that.

"Do you know why we're in an abandoned hospital?" She asked, her voice cracking slightly.

"I don't think this place is a hospital. I don't think it's abandoned either."

"What is that supposed to mean?"

"You haven't seen them yet?"

"Seen who? Grey, what are you talking about?"

"There's no point in lying to you. Not in this place. I'll show you. Follow me."

I gesture slightly with a tilt of my head to the door at the far end of the room, behind what would be the nurses' desk. Her eyes dart to the door, back to me, and then to the door again. Despite her being an adult, she seems completely out of her depth and almost gives off the impression of an abandoned puppy. I don't want to leave her here. I look her in the eyes and give a gentle nod, and she nods back. I walk her over to the door that leads to the hallway while taking a quick glance that the Founders calendar, trying not to draw attention to it. Where once there were five people in lab coats depicted, Sunny being one of them, now there were only four. I wasn't close enough to make out exact details, but I remember that Sunny was the shortest among the five, and now her image was gone. Her portrait on the wall was also now blank. We walk to the door, but before I open it, I gesture for her to look through the window.

"See them?" I asked.

"Yeah, barely. They're too far away for me to see clearly. Are they workers here?"

"Not quite." I said under my breath, but just loud enough for her to hear me.

"Who, or... What are they? They almost look like ink blots."

"If I had to guess," I started while completely unsure of what I was going to say next, "I'd say they're more like background characters. It's almost like how someone would describe hospital workers without going into detail."

Her expression shifts from what was once fear and almost crying into one of annoyance and outrage, like I had just said the dumbest thing she'd ever heard.

"What the hell does THAT mean? Background characters?! Like we're in some kind of fucking story?"

Her words stung more than I thought they'd would. I wasn't expecting that reaction from her, though it's true that nothing about what I just said made any sense. She averts her gaze for a moment before collecting her thoughts.

"I'm sorry," she says. "I have no idea where I am, how I got here, or even how long I've been here. I didn't even think to consider that you're in the exact same boat as me. You probably know just as little as I do."

"It's fine," I said, bluntly but as kindly as I could muster. "To be honest, you're the first person I've met in this place, and this is the third time I've gone around."

Her eyes widen as she places herself directly under me in order to stare into my eyes. "You've been here before?"

"Not here, specifically, but this is the third time I've ridden the elevator to this building. Thirtieth floor every time, too."

"So? What does that have to do with anything?"

"I don't know. Maybe nothing, but every time I'm dropped on the thirtieth floor, but the environment changes each time. The first one was an office and the second one was a school."

"Really? That's..." Her voice trails off as if she's realized something before coming back at barely above a whisper. "That's interesting. I guess this would be my second time, then."

I remember that the last dream was the first time I saw a car in the parking lot. A blue sedan, if I recall. "Hey, Sunny." The thoughts itching at the back of my brain begin to crawl their way out of my mouth. "Have we met before? Or, more specifically, have you seen me before?"

"I don't think so. Why do you ask?"

"Sunny, I need you to think really hard on this one. Have you seen me before?"

Her eyes fixate on me for several moments, studying my face. She then closes her eyes, her head tilts down towards the floor, and she begins whispering to herself. "No," she says. "I've seen pictures of other people who I don't know, but you weren't one of them, I don't think."

I let out a long breath through my nose as if I'd been holding it the entire time. I admit that I wasn't expecting that answer.

"Again," she almost squeaks out, "why do you ask?"

"It's because I've seen you before Sunny. Three times, as a matter of fact. In the portraits of the two dreams before this one, and on the calendar over on that wall. You're not on it anymore, though."

She shakes her head seems to disregard the important part of that information. "You think that we're in a dream?"

"It's the only thing I can think of that would make sense. Although, only one aspect of this place makes sense in that regard. I still can't understand what you're doing here if this is my dream."

"IF this is a dream, that is."

"Right. Well, shall we?" I gesture at the door to the hallway.

"Shall we what?"

"Start walking. In my experience, it doesn't get me anywhere, really, but it's something to do."

"Huh. Okay, I guess."

I sarcastically shrug and open the door. The long hallway stood looming over me the same as always. This time, though, I had company. I'm not sure if that makes me feel better or not. Looking over to my left, the same parking lot lays in wait, only this time in darkness. Several street lights dot the vast canvas of grey and white, hinting at the horrors that may lay beyond without giving away the surprise. What it does do, though, is completely obscure the once ominous tree line. Past the edge of the lot now sat a mostly empty void with what appeared to be ink-like shadows flowing in and out at the edge, almost like a tide whose undertow threatens to drag you to the very depths of Hell itself. The shadows, themselves, resembled very much the same ink-like design of the shadowy figures that haunt these halls. Something noticeably missing from the parking lot, however, is the blue sedan that I saw last time. If it really is Sunny's car, then it almost seems like whatever entity runs this place doesn't want to tip its hand too early. The same portraits of the supposed Founders line the hallway, but now several of them are blank and only display the silhouette of a person. I couldn't quite recall at the time, but all of these blank portraits were undoubtedly pictures of Sunny.

"Grey," she whispered nervously. "What the hell is this place?"

"You said this is your second time, right?"

"Yeah. At first, I thought it was just some weird dream I had, but with you here, I don't know what to think anymore."

"I wish I could help you, Sunny. I really do. You seem like a nice enough person, so I won't lie to you. I have no idea what this place is, but I know we're just getting started. Maybe not today, but I can only assume that four more people will be joining us."

"I believe you. You said you've seen me before in some portraits, didn't you? Am I to assume that these blank ones used to be portraits of me?"

"You figured that out already?" I asked, impressed. "Yes, you're dead on, unfortunately."

"Then you think these other four people are also, somehow involved in this?"

"It'd be my best guess."

"Then... I guess my question is, why didn't I see you in any of these portraits? I didn't see myself last time, either, but I assumed that that's to be expected since I can't see myself now. So, Why didn't I see you either?"

I didn't answer. How am I supposed to answer a question like that? "Here we are," I said. "End of the line."

"Now what?" She asked, clearly upset.

"Now, we go through. The first night, I woke up after the third loop. The second night was the same only after... Hmmm." I pause, briefly considering whether or not to tell her about the Hell Door. "The second night was the same. This would be my third loop, now actually. So I'm not sure what happens next now that you're here."

"Do you think that I'll have to make the next two loops myself?" She asked, the worry in her voice rising again.

"Most likely, but I'm not exactly an expert. Now, before we go in, did you see them?"

She looks at me before immediately averting her gaze to the floor. "I wish, I hadn't, but yes."

I let out a deep sigh in sympathy for her. "They're watching us now. They weren't before, but we must have gotten their attention. Just keep your head down, and you'll get through this."

She nods. "Thanks, Grey. If this is your last stop, I hope I see you again soon."

I let out a light chuckle. "What an awful thing to say," I said, jokingly.

Her eyes widened as she realized the implications of what she just said. "No! I mean..."

I smile. "Just kidding." I said in gentle a tone as possible. Looking ahead, I turn the handle and step through the doorway. The last thing I remember hearing is her laughing.

I wake up in my bed. My head is throbbing and my throat is dry. I roll over and check the clock which reads 3:27 AM. I've only been asleep for just over four hours. That last dream was the longest I ever remember experiencing. If I didn't know any better, I'd say I was in there for almost half a day. I step out of bed in order to run to the restroom. Looking myself in the mirror, I notice that I'm wearing the same clothes I was in the dream. Clothes that I most definitely did not fall asleep in. What the hell is going on?
