Day 2

I didn’t sleep last night. I couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw it — the figure, its hollow eyes staring into me, its twisted body looming in the darkness. It’s as if my brain refuses to let me forget what happened, replaying the moment over and over again.

Morning came, and the sunlight did nothing to ease my anxiety. It felt false, like a temporary reprieve from whatever was waiting for me in the shadows. I spent the entire day trying to convince myself that it was all just a nightmare, a trick of my exhausted mind. Maybe the late-night phone call had freaked me out more than I realized, making my imagination run wild.

But deep down, I knew the truth. I wasn’t alone in this house anymore.

By late afternoon, I was running on fumes, my nerves raw. I avoided every reflective surface — mirrors, windows, even my phone’s screen — terrified I’d see that thing staring back at me. My thoughts spiraled, growing darker with each passing hour. What if it wasn’t just a nightmare? What if it had followed me, even now, in the daylight?

As the sun began to set, I made a decision. I was leaving. I had to. I threw some clothes into a bag, grabbed my car keys, and made my way to the front door. The house felt eerily quiet, like it was holding its breath, waiting for me to make a move. Every creak of the floor beneath my feet felt amplified, every shadow seemed to stretch longer than it should.

When I reached the door, I froze.

The doorknob wouldn’t turn.

It was locked, which didn’t make any sense because I hadn’t locked it. I jiggled the handle harder, trying to force it open, but it wouldn’t budge. My heart started racing again. I turned around, looking at the house behind me.

And that’s when I saw it.

Standing at the end of the hallway, in the exact same place it had stood the night before, was the figure. It hadn’t moved since I’d last seen it, but this time, I could see it more clearly. The pale, almost translucent skin stretched too tight over its bones. Its limbs bent at impossible angles, and its head tilted unnaturally to the side. The eyes — those horrible hollow eyes — were locked onto mine.

It didn’t speak this time. It didn’t have to.

It was waiting.

My hands shook as I backed away from the door, my mind racing. There had to be a way out. A window, a back door, something. I ran into the kitchen, flinging open the back door — but it wouldn’t open either. It was like the whole house had trapped me inside.

A cold sweat broke out across my skin as the air around me grew heavier, colder. I glanced back toward the hallway. The figure was still there, but it had moved closer. Slowly, deliberately, like it had all the time in the world.

I bolted for the living room, throwing my shoulder against the large window. The glass rattled, but held. Desperation clawed at my chest. I grabbed a chair and hurled it against the glass. It shattered with a deafening crash, but instead of daylight streaming in, the broken window revealed nothing but blackness. Thick, impenetrable darkness, as if the world outside had ceased to exist.

I staggered back, breathless. It was too late. It was all too late.

The figure was in the room now. I could feel it before I saw it. The air grew colder, thick with an unnatural presence. The lights flickered, and for a moment, the room was plunged into total darkness.

And then, it was right behind me.

I didn’t turn around. I couldn’t. But I felt its breath on the back of my neck, cold and dry, like the touch of death itself.

"I told you," it whispered, its voice a rasp in the silence. "I’m already inside."

I bolted for my bedroom, slamming the door shut behind me, my chest heaving with ragged breaths. But I knew it didn’t matter. The door couldn’t keep it out. Nothing could.

I collapsed onto the bed, gripping the blankets like they could somehow protect me. The room felt suffocating, as if the very walls were closing in on me.

Then, from the corner of my eye, I saw it.

In the mirror.

The figure stood behind me, but this time, it wasn’t just a reflection. It was there, in the room with me. Its head tilted, hollow eyes fixed on me, unblinking.

I turned around to face it, but when I did, the room was empty. Yet in the mirror, the figure remained, watching, waiting.

It raised a hand, slowly pointing toward me.

The lights flickered again, and this time, they went out completely.

I couldn’t see it anymore, but I could feel it — right next to me, in the darkness.

And then, the voice came again, closer than ever, a whisper in my ear:

"You can’t run. You’ll never leave."

The last thing I remember before I blacked out was the cold, skeletal hand resting on my shoulder, and the overwhelming sense of finality that came with it.

When I woke up this morning, the house was exactly as it had been. No broken window, no shattered glass. The doors were unlocked, the mirrors clear.

But I know it’s not over.

It’s still inside.
