I'm writing this from the psychiatric ward, where she’s gotten me locked up for insanity. My accusation of the beloved “gardener and author” Penelope was far more unbelievable than a student with no history of mental illness, including genetically, going suddenly loopy. Everyone gasped and pointed the finger of delusions at me, but I’m not schizophrenic, I've just seen the truth. Penelope Harrow has been putting deadly nightshade in my food, and the facts will get out there before I die.

She came into my life a year ago, on the 21^(st) of January 2024. My dad was swept off his feet and forgot to be just that, a dad. She always hated me, making snide remarks about how little I did for my dad, or how I should be out with friends more. My dad wore rose-tinted glasses, and the comments went over his head. The symptoms started soon after she moved in, I was getting sick constantly. My throat was always dry, and I had fevers almost weekly. I would get so hot that I'd hallucinate and become delirious. My grades started to slip and with that so did my dream of studying at Oxford, I didn’t even manage to attend the mocks that would give me my predicted grades. The doctors told me my future would have to wait for my health. Penelope was suddenly acting caring, bringing me meals, and making me eat them, even when I was vomiting. They'd make me better, she’d say, my body needed fuel. I did appreciate her efforts at first, however fake they may have been, I'm not a psychic, so I didn’t immediately think the worst. I knew I didn’t like her, though.  

My sickness left me ordered to bedrest, and with so little energy, YouTube was one of the only ways to cure my boredom. I enjoy history, so I was watching a video on medieval poisons, and one caught my eye: deadly nightshade. I froze as I saw the side effects: hallucinations, dry throat and mouth, constipation, and increased heart rate. All the things that I'd been suffering with for months, that the doctors couldn’t diagnose. They were all right in front of me. I spent the whole of that day researching and was dead set on the culprit. I eased myself up to the bedroom window and looked into the garden that I hadn’t been well enough to sit in for months. Garden peas and potatoes were growing as well as carrots. I saw sunflowers, and daisies scattering the grass, and tucked away behind the tomato-filled greenhouse, there they were. The nightshades, and my stepmother, who was looking around cautiously, before plucking one from the stem. It was nearly dinner time.

When she brought up my food, I refused it “I know what you're doing to me”

She forced a look of confusion, but I saw the twinge of fear in her dark eyes.  

“I'm not sure what you mean, hunny. You're not well” she said, patronisingly.

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing when that night she cried to my dad “She attacked me! She was accusing me of poisoning her, she’s not well”

I was helpless when the next day the doctors took me away. I've been good, so I'm allowed an hour of communal time in the library each day, though my computer usage is monitored. I've made this Reddit account, and I hope they don’t make me delete the post. I hope one of you believes me. If anyone sees this, spread the word, Francine Grey is innocent, and Penelope Harrow is a monster.
