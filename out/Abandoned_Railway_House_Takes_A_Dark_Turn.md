Hey folks, posted this in a thread about dark experiences doing urban exploration. Was encouraged to post here. I love to write and am happy to have been directed to this sub. I hope you enjoy this traumatic adolescent memory, lol. 

A friend and I were with a couple of girls back in the day in our late teens. We were driving around in bumfuck, bored, decided to drive to a nearby mountain and see the sights.  Hoping to get some action after a joint or two. We come upon this old dirt road that came out into a large open area going up the side of the mountain. There was a random gate with a simple latch. From there, you could see an old train depot about halfway up the open area. 

The area was in the middle of absolutely nowhere and had a lot of history in logging, which the train would have been primarily used to transport lumber and workers. Depot may not have been the right word, as no trains were parked there. But it was a decent sized building with a small booth out front that still had the rusted levers and mechanisms to switch tracks. 

So the girls start saying that we should go in and explore the main building. Obviously teasing us to see if we'd chicken out. As it honestly looked pretty dilapidated and ominous. But in the spirit of teenage hormones and insecurity, we opened the gate and drove onward. After exploring the booth and the perimeter, we went in. 

At first, it was completely empty, nothing too crazy. But it was definitely eerie. I'm desperately trying to ignore the weed stoking my paranoia of suddenly running into another person way out here. Half for my own sanity and half because of the girl practically on my hip, who I could tell was visibly uncomfortable but trying to play it off. Her friend was laughing and doing the whole "boo!" shit out of rooms to the rest of us. 

We get to an area that was once probably a kitchen and see a door that we can only surmise is some kind of basement. We open it slowly. We never made it down. Up to pretty much the first three steps is just still water from years of mountain snowmelt. Maybe there were busted pipes that had run long enough before being shut off however many decades ago. 

I have no fucking clue, all I knew is that the water looked repulsive and smelled worse. The floorboards feeling somewhat soft suddenly made a lot more sense than just age. I'm immediately envisioning us falling through the floor of this shithole and getting dunked into a soup a century in the making. But in the hubris of youth, we kept going upstairs. 

It was just a long hallway with a window on the end and two doors on each side. The light from the window made the doorways seem like black holes, but that may have been the fact that my entire mind is just begging to get this over with and get the fuck out of here. But we hadn't found anywhere near the worst of it. The first three rooms are nothing but cobwebs, and dust. But the fourth. 

Two dirty mattresses that weren't new but too new for this place. Side by side. Dark stains on them. No sheets. Two backpacks, one that was just emptied of junk all over the floor. But on the mattress and off to the side were multiple pairs of women's panties with blood on them. What got me is there were different sizes. There were fresh food wrappers, too. 

My gut fucking sank and I genuinely began trembling, the other backpack had a more masculine look to it and had some clothes visible in the main compartment. My senses immediately flooded with dread, and the feeling of "something really bad happened here, get the fuck out now" was overwhelming. I looked at the girl I was with, and she was silently crying beside me, death gripping my sleeve. 

My friend and his girl were dead silent and wide-eyed beside us. They'd been goofing off the entire time. You could hear a pin drop. We all wordlessly were listening to see if whoever was responsible was moving in the building. What felt like an eternity passed until I finally snapped out of the panic. The sun was setting. 

"D, we gotta move, fucking hoof it. Don't run downstairs, we'll probably go through." 

I don't think I'd seen him drive faster, which is saying something. He didn't touch the brake until we were miles away and back into a town. Nobody spoke for a good couple of hours. We went about the night, paired off to our own places. Outside of one conversation I had with D about it years later. None of us spoke of it again. 

I got chills writing this off the memory alone. I was fucking terrified.
