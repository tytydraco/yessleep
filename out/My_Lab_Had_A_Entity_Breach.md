I am a scientist at a hidden lab in **\[REDACTED\]** We expirement on entities from different dimensions and its a interesting job. We are very isolated in this lab and have no signal usually and so our operations are underground. On the very bottom floor of the lab we have a wormhole machine that nobody is allowed to except special engineers, workers etc. None of us know what goes on down there but every second business day we get a new entity every day. These vary from strange humanoid creatures to other types of.. things that are different. There aren’t much words to describe these things but we have to study them, investigate on them and other things that I cannot disclose. When the jails are full the prisoners are sent here to suffer. Even if they were to escape they couldn’t get far as the freezing tempetures (-10 degrees Celsius) make it impossible. Their purpose is to get experimented on and die, most of our entities are very aggressive. This week I was assigned to experiment on a entity called a “Skin Stealer.” I have named this entity this because from my research they eat flesh when hungered. From an expirement i ran. They are tall humanoid like creatures. They can mimic human speech. Occasionally it repeats what the prisoner said before it was feasted on. Their blood is also transparent. After discovering that last bit of info i headed to the lounge for a break. I was watching the World Cup Final on the television when the lights went out. Me and Max were confused. Max was my friend who worked in the lab and he also experimented  on entities aswell. He was also telling me about his entity who he named “Crunch“ apparently he can sprint faster then Usain Bolt and feasts on humans, He hasn’t done more research then that.

The lights were cutoff and then an alarm started blaring. The red emergency lights were switched on and the lights were flashing. According to the lab rules we had to wait until they announced the problem. About 15 seconds later an announcement came off from the speaker.

**“THIS IS A ENTITY BREACH. TRUCKS ARE BEING PREPARED AND PLANES”**

This meant we had to run as fast as we could to a jet to transport staff members to The nearest country. Me and Max opened the door from the canteen. The lights were flashing and the alarm was blaring louder then in the room. There was heavy gun fire going on and screams off terror. More men in armed black armour suits were sprinting down the hall. On this hall where the canteen was located was pretty darn long. There were at least 10 rooms of staffs quarters this was the place we came to relax. We looked down the hall and saw bodies and blood was splattered on the doors, there was a massive puddle of blood and a scientists body and a guard trying to shoot the entity with his handgun. He was a floor guard, just a regular security guard but the men in the black armoured suits were armed with MP4s and hand grenades. There were 5 of them. The other stairwell leading up to the lab floor was shut off to prevent anymore entities from entering the floor. One of the guards ordered us to run. We sprinted up the stairwell leading to the outside. While i was running up, i heard a blood curdling scream come from behind me. I turned around to see my dear friend getting grabbed in the dimly lit hall, where it smelt like blood,sweat and smoke. My Skinwalker grabbed him and took a massive bite of his ear. Blood splatted on my lab jacket, i muttered a quiet sorry and adrenaline made me run so fast i was on the top floor nearest the exit almost immediately. When i came out there was automatic gunfire and prisoners lined up to exit to the trucks. The guards surrounded the staff exit. I exited and safely boarded the plane. I let out a soft sob for my friend.

15 Minutes later they announced that we would be taking off we hurdled off the arctic runway and as we were lifting off the ground there was a massive explosion and the lab was destroyed. Gone. My entire life and career was destroyed in a flash.

After safely touching down in Buenos Aires we were directed to a hotel where we stayed until our flights to our native homes were done. I was the only one flying to Ireland. After about a week of silence i got an email, it read

**Greetings Mr O’Brien.**

I am afraid your job at our lab has been terminated. A staff member smashed all the glass cages somehow and released them all, causing pandemonium and we had to demolish our lab in Antartica via nano thermite. We have sent you all a 5000$ reduncy fee. Any history of you working here has been erased.

Thank you for your work,

Artur Jackson.

After that i opened my bank account and I saw a one cent transfer with a note attached.

Dear Mr O’Brien, we saw what you have done. That thermite explosion was you, who detonated the lab and i know it was you who called the UN to inform them about our illegal expiermentation. For this we have to punish you, thank you for your work.

Fuck, they scanned my pockets and saw the matches, i think my facial expression gave it away aswell. I am writing this now because i heard a knock at my door. Please…pray for me.
