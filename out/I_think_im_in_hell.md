Hello people

I saw this reddit and wanted to vent to it. There's something on my heart that I have to tell someone, but I'm afraid that people won't take me seriously. A Therapists would just think I was just another weirdo. I don't even know whether I can reach anyone here or not, after all, I don't think this is really the earth. Maby every replay on this post will not be a real person. I just dont know what realyty actualy is.

It all started on that fateful day, the day I died for the first time. It was a beautiful day, a day you won't forget, the birds were chirping and people greeted each other. I was on my way to work when suddenly a speeder hit me with his car, I felt like my bones were breaking and my organs were bursting and then I felt nothing anymore just cold and then I woke up.

I looked around, all sweaty. I wasn't in the hospital but in my house. When I turned on my phone to see what time it was, I saw that it was the same prime time that I had woken up before. The date was also the same. I knew for sure that I wasn't just having a bad dream. It was the same day. My first reaction was to call in sick (I didn't want to get run over again). I just wanted to switch off for a bit after this and didn't do anything else until the evening. And it started again when I wanted to take a bath I slipped out and hit my head and my eyes went black. I stood up again. And this cycle repeated itself,

I died, I came back

I died, I came back

I died, I came back

I died, I came back

I died, I came back

I died, I came back

I died, I came back

And up untill now i died 78 times, from burning, drowning, poison every way posible, if i try to avoid my death I just die in an other way. After the 3 first deaths I began to think for a reason or an explanation why only I experience it. I started to think that it may be a curse or maby my consciousness shifts to an other version of me in an other univers or the most frightening the theory i came up with is that this place is my hell. The place where I "burn" for my since as a person. Mayby my first death just was my real death and thats it. I am just forevery her. Alone. You probably asc me why alon, dont you? its easy if this here is hell than those people here might actually not be real but just illusions so that I would see my loved ones just in the knowlage that they might not be real. That might be the real torture.

best regards, the cursed one
