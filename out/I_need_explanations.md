Me (22), Girlfriend (26). I know this post is long, but I need to understand this, I want to understand this logically. I do believe in the supernatural but I would like to solve this logically.

My girlfriend recently moved to a new town for work, rented and moved into a new 20-story apartment with her co-worker a few months ago (they live on the 11th floor). We don't live together, she is working as an office assistant at a private church school. She tells me about hearing noises at night a few times now, such as clicking noises, piano noises, marble noises, and moving furniture from upstairs. But I never thought of it being the supernatural, but something happened yesterday night that’s making me doubt my logic.

If I had to describe the clicking noise it would be a loud switching of a light switch which doesn’t resemble any switches in her house. The piano noise is just a single note being played over and over again, I have no clue what the piano noise could be. As for the marble noises, I am confident it was the pipes because I heard that before in my apartment as well. I get it if I hear furniture moving upstairs during the day but we hear furniture moving at midnight every now and then. Unless our neighbours upstairs love moving furniture in the middle of the night.

Something weird happened a few weeks back, she received a parcel without a label indicating who's is it from. Just her name and unit number on it written down with a marker and the parcel was wrapped completely in multiple layers of orange tape. My girlfriend never opened it and just left it outside the unit for a day to see if anyone took it back, or if it was sent to the wrong unit even tho highly unlikely. pic is in the link: [https://imgur.io/a/EzIqZeQ](https://imgur.io/a/EzIqZeQ) 

The next day the parcel was still there and my girlfriend took it inside and placed it in the 3rd bedroom where nobody stayed in, they use it as a guest bedroom. The bedroom is closest to the entrance and has a window that can be accessed if someone wanted to climb in from the walkway outside of the unit. They aren’t close to any neighbours and never mentioned their names to any of them. My girlfriend left the box in that room for a few days and never checked on it, we just kinda forgotten about it tbh, I told her I will come by during the weekends to check it out for them but it was gone. We asked the housemate if she had taken it but she said no. The windows were locked and no sign of breaking in. We discussed about the possibilities:

1. maybe it's the neighbour wanting to gift them something
2. maybe a stalker perhaps? But they recently moved to a new town and don’t really know anyone. My girlfriend also mentioned she didn’t encounter any weirdos.
3. Maybe someone gave and told the security guard to send the parcel up to their unit.

But all the possibilities we came up with don’t explain why the parcel was gone inside their unit. The person who left the parcel would have needed access to enter their unit to take it back and know my girlfriend’s name and unit number. But we never conclude the conversation and just kinda moved on with our lives and forgot about it again.

We did try to move out but we are still having complications with her housemate and the landlord since the tenancy agreement is til next year.

Last Wednesday, 21st June. They heard piano noises from outside their room at midnight but just slept anyways. My girlfriend did use those apps that can check what notes were being played and that’s how we know it's only one note being repeated continuously.

2 days ago, her roommate went back to her hometown to visit her family. But last night or should I say just now 2:40am, she texted me saying she is scared and that she heard noises again and can’t sleep. I asked if her bedroom door was locked, and it was. I told her not to go outside while we continue to observe if there were any other noises from outside. I even told her to check for footsteps, but no sign of shadow or sound of footsteps from the bottom of the door. The kitchen light is always on so we could see if there’s someone walking outside.

She told me she heard someone or something sneezing outside as well as clicking noises. She went to the door and recorded what she heard to send to me, she sent me 2 voice messages (vc) with a 5 minutes gap between both vc and in both vc I could hear someone sneezing outside her room. I suggested getting on a call with her as she falls asleep. So if anything happens I can call the police or drive to her apartment straight away. I didn’t go straight away because I have a strict Asian dad who would kill me if I leave my house at 3am.

Sometimes the clicking noises are soft as if it's far away and sometimes it's loud as if it's the thing just right outside her room. The noise comes and goes, and it usually lingers for a few mins before stopping again. She went back to sleep and I was just listening, I heard the clicking noises a few more times, and at 4:30am I heard it again. This time it was super loud, even from the call. Every 1-2 seconds it clicks. I texted to see if she was okay, but she was still asleep. 4:41am she woke up from the noises and saw my msg, we switch to video call so she can show me around her room. There’s still clicking noise that comes and goes. I tried googling to find an answer and didn’t find anything and see if anyone experienced similar things. I saw someone who mentioned hearing similar things on Reddit, that's why I am making this Reddit post.

As of now, I think the parcel incident and the noises she heard from outside her room at night are separate incidents but I can’t be too sure now. It’s 8am and I haven’t slept. And the last noise we heard was from 5am. She is safe, she went back to sleep a while ago and still on a call with me. It's morning now, I will sleep once I am done with this post. Please if anyone knows what’s up. Please let me know… I am worried about her safety and afraid of the unknown. Both incidents are very concerning.
