I am an astronaut, and on my first mission, an entity spoke to me from within the stars. I've always loved space and the stars since I was a kid. I loved the cosmos so much that on my seventh birthday, my parents bought me my first telescope.


The stars were my fascination; I could not stop observing them. At that time, NASA had a channel where you could see Earth from the point of view of a satellite. It was the epitome of Pokémon to me; I was obsessed.


So, becoming an astronaut was an obvious decision. On my first mission into space, I was more than ecstatic. I could barely handle myself at the space station; my dreams had come true, but with a sense of duty.


While space is beautiful, it is equally dangerous. Any rash decision could lead to suffering a cruel, slow death, along with the other astronauts—six in total, including me. Our job was to maintain a space station that is being used for studying deep space.


The first week was normal: nothing out of the ordinary, typical maintenance, cleaning, software updates, and regular spacewalks. It started during the second week of the mission, as I was installing a new software update for a sensor, Chief Scott, the senior astronaut, tapped me on the shoulder.


"Morris, call it a day; you have done good work today. Get yourself some shut-eye."


"Yes, sir, thank you, sir," my response came out very stiff.


Chief Scott laughed, "No need for formalities, son; we're all astronauts here—old or new; it doesn't matter."


I thanked him and excused myself; my nerves still got to me a little bit. Chief Scott was in charge of us, and everyone except him was a new astronaut.


When I got to my cabin, I realized how tired I was. My body was still not completely accustomed to the station's day and night cycle. I immediately got into my sleeping bag that I had strapped to the ceiling of the small room. I sank into sleep, and that's when it first invoked my presence.


I was floating in space, facing down. My body was inert and naked; the lack of sound and the searing cold were enough for me to realize that I was dreaming. This lucid dream was painful and macabre.


Being in space with no gear is an astronaut's worst nightmare. I tried not to be afraid; I knew I would wake up eventually.


Until I heard it—the tongue; it spoke. I could not understand it or describe it. The human vocal cords do not have the ability to reproduce such verbiage. Its language was one that only a god could comprehend, ethereal and beyond comprehension.


Even though I couldn't decipher its speech, the emotions portrayed coursed through my veins: fear, urgency, dread, vulnerability. It was trapped among the stars, craving freedom. It had existed for eons in this state of stagnation; it was pleading for help.


I woke up cold; its unearthly dialect no longer echoed in me. I was finally alone in my mind again. I stared down at my empty, cramped cabin. A loose charger cord floated near me.


It made no sense that something that ancient wanted my help or existed. This dream was challenging any notion of reality that I knew. 
My mind was hyper-fixated on the perception that a different kind asked for my aid.


In a space station, you're stuck 24/7 with your crewmates. If someone is acting strange, everyone notices immediately. I spent the next day feigning normality when, in truth, my mind was drowning in questions.


Was it real?


Am I going insane?


If it's real, where is it?


Why does it want me to help it?


All these questions and more were racing in my mind as I was getting suited for my first spacewalk ever. Chief Scott watched as Fernandez and I were being helped with our gear by our fellow astronauts, Malcolm and Smith. 


"Fernandez and Morris, you know the drill. You will both be under constant communication with us and Ground Control. Your task is not a difficult one, but in any situation, just know you're not alone," The Chief informed us.


"They're all set," Malcolm notified The Chief.


Smith patted me on the shoulder. "Have fun," he said.


Chief Scott nodded to us, and we were then released into the inky darkness that is space.


The task at hand was nothing strenuous; we were just cleaning the debris that had accumulated in various parts of the space station. My thoughts kept distracting me so much that it was slowing me down significantly, to the point that Fernandez noticed.


"Morris, are you nervous?" she radioed me.


"Fuck," I had thought to myself.


"Just a little bit. Let's continue," I radioed her back.


"Remember what the chief said, Morris? We can rely on each other," she radioed back instantly.


I wanted her to drop it. Fernandez is a nice person; I have been in some deep-sea diving training with her, so we knew each other pretty well. Her being concerned for me meant that I had already failed at acting normal.


She took the hint, and we proceeded to work. My eyes were constantly drawn to the stars.


Where was it?


In what self-luminous ball of gas was that being supposedly confined? I stared at the cosmos; my vision blurred and sharpened rapidly.


I started getting flashes of red, boiling heat. The entity's voice thundered in my brain, the indecipherable language screaming,


"Close, so close!"


At least that's how it felt. It was showing me its location.


The heat flared; it was so potent. The entity howled in pain. My head felt like it was going to explode into a thousand gory pieces. That's when my senses came back to me.


A cacophony of screaming voices greeted me as I returned from the astral trip that had been forced upon me.


Fernandez and The Chief were yelling at me through the radio.


"Morris, you're floating away! Morris, come in! Morris, answer!"


I realized I was more or less 20 ft away from the station. My safety tether was straining to keep me from wandering deeper into the void. I slowly positioned myself facing the space station and activated my jetpack, propelling my body in bursts back to the station.


Back inside, I got questioned extensively. I had been unresponsive for 15 minutes; everyone was freaking out, justifiably. Fernandez was on the verge of tears, and The Chief made me get checked out by Dr. Taylor, our astronaut medic on board.


Dr. Taylor asked me what had happened out there. I lied that the pressure of the air in my suit caused me to black out momentarily.


He grumbled, "Damn it, Morris! You're making me work for no reason."


"Ground Control wants a whole new physical done on you," he said while he shined a light in my eyes.


I could still see the sights it had shown me; they were burned into my retinas.


The entity had said, "Close, so close!"


Proxima Centauri is the closest star to Earth, a red dwarf star from the Alpha Centauri system. Proxima is 4.25 light years away. There was no possibility that I could aid in its release.


I was not allowed to perform any space walks after the incident. Ground Control had to first analyze my physical exam that Dr. Taylor sent them; then, maybe I would be able to partake in the activity.


My first space walk was a fiasco; I was livid with myself. All my hard work was going down the drain. What honestly had me the most upset was that I had become extremely engrossed by The Entity above anything else, even over my career. 


Life in space has always been a source of discourse for centuries. I felt like I was on the verge of a groundbreaking discovery. I could have been the man that put the debate to rest.


I was foolish thinking that I was in charge of any situation that I had control; all I had were delusions of grandeur.


I was festering in my own self-hatred while I exercised my puny attempt to demonstrate that I had the capability to join in space walks.


Malcolm floated by; he was catching bubbles of water with his mouth. Malcolm is the most free-spirited member of the crew. He doesn't seem to worry much.


"Are you getting your glutes back in shape?" he asked humorously.


He was trying to get my spirits up, but I couldn't even muster the idea of smiling. I faked it anyways;


I gave him a dry smile. "I can't have myself passing out again," I said.


He nodded; a solitary bubble of water crashed into his brown hair. "You'll be out there again in no time. Ground Control just wants to make sure you're healthy.


"We're out here for five months; you will get another chance." He said waving his fingers at me.


"I hope so. This is what we work for, to be out there," I said, trying to lean into his positivity.


"You gotta keep that attitude, man. The worst thing you can do is be depressed in space," he said more cheerfully.


I wasn't so sure; I felt like I was overreacting, but I did not know if The Entity would call out to me again in the same manner out there, causing another blackout.


I went to sleep after exercising and talking to Malcolm a bit more. I didn't have to wait long for the Entity's call.


To me lucid dreams are incredible experiences; it feels like you are peering into your own brain, getting a behind-the-scenes look at your soul.


All that said, they are very unpleasant when you are dying in them. There was a massive hole in the spacecraft, and I was being sucked out into space slowly.


I was trying to hold my breath, attempting to keep as much oxygen in my lungs as possible. Despite what Hollywood has demonstrated in movies, a death in space is unhurried and excruciating.


Any amount of oxygen dissipates; your blood boils and freezes over depending on your position to the sun. There's nothing to hold on to; you cannot scream, you writhe in pain, and you die a silent death.


In this dream, I was getting a taste of that steady torture; my body was being melted and frostbitten consecutively. My deprivation of oxygen had fully set in; the asphyxiation provided by space was causing me to contort my desperate body that was begging for air.


Just when I was about to break my spine, the Entity's rumbling voice started to resonate within my core. Instantly, I recovered the ability to breathe again; my coagulated body settled back to its normal state.


I looked at the sun; its radiation blistered so bright, but it did not bother me. The Entity's voice reassured me it was protecting me from the wrath of space; it felt heavenly. The rumbling comforted me; the nightmare had evolved into a religious experience.


There was no pain left to feel, just glory. The next day, I felt refreshed. I had been baptized in space; everything felt and looked brighter. My worries were fading away.


I felt amazing. My inner turmoil of the past days was not important to me anymore. I wanted to find a way to help it, a way to relieve its pain just like it did to me.


I could hear the voice of God whispering in my ear.


A month passed, its presence spreading like a disease. I could hear its voice periodically susurrating in my ear; its intentions were clear. It wanted to show me the secrets of the oblivion. 
To do that, it needed my help to escape its burning prison.


Under the abnormal solace that I had been feeling, a creeping sensation of being watched permeated through me. It was a constant feeling of being observed, especially in our telescope room.


We peer through the telescopes at the celestial bodies, and they reveal their shapes and colors to us. I felt as if I was being stared at right back, but it didn't deter me.


I had been spending a lot of time in the telescope room, studying the Alpha Centauri system obsessively.


The Alpha Centauri system is a southern constellation that consists of three stars: Rigil Kentaurus, Toliman, and Proxima Centauri. Proxima is the smallest and faintest of the trio. Rigil and Toliman are sun-like stars, and they stand out far more.


The rest of the crew had joined me that day, except The Chief, who said that he had been feeling under the weather the last couple of days. He was isolating himself in his cabin in case he could pass it on to the rest of us.


Everyone has their own telescope, but we all share the main telescope that has the capability to look into deep space.


"So what's got your attention so caught as of late, Morris?" Smith called out to me while he looked through the telescope.


I hesitated to answer, but in the end, I did not see the harm in responding truthfully: 


"The Alpha Centauri system."


Fernandez, who was struggling to put her long black hair in a bun, stopped and stared at me. Smith, who was still looking at space, asked me


"Why are you so focused on that constellation?" He asked with a hint of humor in his tone.


"Toliman and Rigil looked like one star; you can't even see Proxima." He continued incredulously 


"You're watching paint dry, brother." Malcolm piped up.


I resisted the urge to be defensive; it wasn't their fault they wouldn't understand. Even if I told them, I was going to laugh their jokes away, but Fernandez spoke before me.


"But it isn't, though! The Alpha Centauri system doesn't just have those stars; it has the exoplanets Proxima b, c, and d." she said


Proxima b might be habitable and Earth-sized. Proxima d is another Mars, a planet that orbits way too close to its Sun." she said excited 


And Proxima c is like a ghost; not confirmed; not even with modern technology has its detection been recreated." I chimed in.


"How is that not interesting? You guys stare at Earth trying to see the continents move in real-time." Fernandez poked fun at the guys.


"You got us there!" Malcom laughed


"Yeah, I completely forgot about the exoplanets," Smith said, chuckling while he adjusted the telescope, his eyes never abandoning the great beyond.


We went quiet for a while; everybody went back to minding their own business. Fernandez and I quietly talked about the exoplanets, specifically Proxima c and its mysteries. Smith suddenly startled everyone.


"Holy shit, Morris, you may have been on to something!" His voice was full of awe and surprise.


"What do you mean?" I asked, trying to figure out if he was joking.


"Come here, it looks like we have something to report to Ground Control if they haven't already noticed it!" Smith motioned me towards the telescope.


I took a look; Smith had changed the direction of the telescope; it was facing south. He was looking at the Alpha Centauri constellation.


With how much I had been studying the constellation, I should have recognized it instantly, but it took me a solid minute because there were two stars shining brightly.


Proxima was gleaming radiantly; it looked down on me, smiling beautifully. I basked in its glow momentarily. I eventually backed away from the telescope; all I could say was,


"How?"


"I don't know, but it's amazing!" Smith said breathlessly.


Fernandez and Malcolm joined in, peering through the telescope as well. Smith left the room to go get Dr. Taylor, who had gone to the bathroom. We took turns watching like moths to a flame; we were hypnotized.


My attention was so captured that I was oblivious to the unnatural spectral left that echoed throughout the space station.


For the next two weeks, we saw little to nothing of The Chief. Ground Control and the crew were very worried for his well-being. He reassured us from behind his locked cabin door that he was healthy enough to remain in space.


Ground Control was offering to transport him back to Earth and bring a replacement supervisor so the mission would not be interrupted.


"I will be completely fine soon," The Chief said; his voice was muffled slightly.


"At least let me check you," Dr. Taylor said, knocking on the door.


"You just might have space motion sickness, or the microgravity might be affecting you." Dr. Taylor lied to the chief.


In truth, the entire crew thought The Chief was dealing with psychological problems that were being produced by stress. It's very common for these problems to arise in astronauts who are in space for a prolonged amount of time due to the confinement.


To Dr. Taylor's impatience and annoyance—Chief Scott's response to his pleas was just hearty laughter.


"I would know if I had that; this is something different. Let Ground Control know I'm all right."The Chief said dismissively 


"We will fulfill our mission."  


He left no room for argument; he was completely bought into his own narrative. This forced us to discuss what was the best course of action. While Dr. Taylor continued to talk with The Chief, 


"Someone has to stay by his door." Smith said pensively.


"Yeah, we have to make sure he doesn't hurt himself and that he eats and drinks. We can't have him starving himself." Fernandez added.


"It's so strange; he's an experienced astronaut. You'd think something like this wouldn't happen to him." I said.


Smith furrowed his brow at my statement. "I hope Dr. Taylor gets him out of that room. It's going to be a real bad look on The Chief, leaving new recruits like us fending for ourselves. As capable as we are, he still is the supervisor."


"They could fire him, or they could retire him." Fernandez said.


"Trust the doc, guys. He also has a degree in psychology; he'll have him out of that room." Malcolm interjected.


"Plus, Ground Control is super pumped with our sighting of Proxima." Malcolm said triumphantly 


"It's the first time they have gotten a proper sighting without having to use its radiation signatures." he said enthusiastically.


Malcolm always likes to see the bright side of things; he managed to get a smile out of everyone, but the issue still persisted when Dr. Taylor joined us.


"Any luck Taylor?" Fernandez asked.


The doctor shook his head."He is as stubborn as a mule." 


"We can't keep lying to Ground Control for too long. Do you think you can get him out before we all get in trouble?" Smith asked the doctor.


"Of course; I just need more time with him."Dr. Taylor answered immediately.


"Then the consensus is final, Taylor. You're going to stay by The Chief's side all day while we maintain the station."


"Are we all good with that?" Smith announced.


No one objected. The Doctor, on the contrary, was eager to treat the chief. He wanted to coax The Chief out of his cabin. Everyone else resumed their daily routine while the doctor remained vigilant. He only moved to eat or to go to the bathroom.


A day or two later, I was carrying some prepared suits. As I was passing by the hallway that led to The Chief's cabin, I saw Dr. Taylor crouched down, pressed against the door, whispering indistinct words.


In those days, my head had been feeling fuzzy, and it grew tenfold when I looked at the doctor; his hands were pressed together, almost in a praying position. It was a surreal scene, but I didn't question it.


I summed it up to the doctor giving The Chief some sort of private therapy with their religious beliefs. The days went on; Ground Control had gone quiet, and the doctor practically lived by the door.


The entity's voice became prominent; I could hear him in the walls. Those days were a blurry daze, almost as if I was in the backseat of my mind while someone else was driving.


While I was in this stupor, I had a recurring thought that stood out to me: the entity's voice was less urgent, more passive. It still wanted my help, but compared to when it first made contact with me, it almost seemed calm and calculated.


I don't know when I dozed off, but it felt like I was regaining consciousness. I was standing on the precipice of the space station, looking down at the vast void.


The stars sparkled at me with their flirtatious beauty. His voice surrounded me; it surged through the fog in my head. It was excited; it wanted me to jump.


If I really trusted it, I would and should release myself, abandoning my current state, allowing my vessel to ascend and become a living shooting star that would head in its direction. My will was his own, but it got too exhilarated.


I was on the verge of accepting its command when the vision of a mummified body appeared in my brain. Its features were familiar; the body shape, although emaciated almost to the bones, was recognizable to me.


The husk was me.


That grotesque display snapped me back to my senses. He was going to protect me from the nature of space, but in exchange, I was going to become a living corpse, preserved in rot and cold. 


I was going to feel every moment of it—my flourishing decomposition—all until I wasn't myself anymore, just its flesh puppet.


It wanted me; it needed me.


Why?


Nourishment.


I woke up in my cabin, standing in front of my door. I was breathing heavily, and my clothes were completely drenched in cold sweat.


I stood there for a while, trying to regain my composure; my body temperature kept going from hot to cold with every drip of sweat that slid down my back. When I was attempting to get my wet hair out of my stinging eyes, three very slow consecutive knocks rang through my cabin door.


The sound sent a chill through me. I moved towards the door, but I struggled because I was completely on edge, and my limbs didn't want to stop trembling.


When I opened the door, on the other side stood Chief Scott. He stood there smiling in the dim light; the space station was in its nighttime cycle. The quiet, droning hum of the space station was interrupted by the chief's voice:


"You spoke with him, didn't you, Morris?"


I could only nod.


"It was beautiful, wasn't it?"


"It is," I croaked out.


"You know how it feels to rejoice in his presence, so why did you deny him?" he said to me in a disbelieving manner.


"Why did you not accept his divinity, Morris?"


"It lied; it's been lying to us," I said. My throat was so dry I could barely talk.


The Chief closed his eyes; he moved his head disapprovingly. "We were almost complete; now you're going to suffer for interfering."


He then lunged at me; his hands were going for my neck. I fought back, trying to defend myself as we twisted in the air. Suddenly, a piercing pain ruptured from my arm. The Chief had given up on strangling me; he was biting my arm.


I punched him with my free arm many times, trying to get him off. He was like a feral animal. I let out a scream of pain; he was gnawing hungrily at my flesh.


Minutes that felt like hours later, I heard yelling voices entering my cabin as I violently struggled to remove the rabid Chief off of me.


"What the hell is going on?" Smith and Malcolm hollered as they ripped The Chief off my bleeding arm.


"He's gone mad!" I screamed.


Chief Scott was laughing maniacally; his mouth was full of my blood. Smith and Malcolm held him down while Fernandez had torn up a white shirt I had to use as a tourniquet for my wound. They dragged him out of the room.


"Did he just come in here and assault you?" Fernandez asked while gritting her teeth as she tightened the makeshift tourniquet.


"Yeah, I opened the door, and he attacked me for no reason," I lied; I didn't need them thinking I was crazy as well.


"I wonder how Dr. Taylor didn't notice he left his room?" she said, leading me out of my room.


I stopped dead in my tracks and looked at her.


"We need to check on Taylor."


We rushed to Malcolm and Smith, who had restrained Chief Scott with one of the safety tethers.


"Have you all seen Dr. Taylor?" we said urgently. They turned to look at The Chief; his face had turned solemn.


"Taylor has accepted his mission; he has released himself to him. He is beyond our reach now."


Smith, the strongest of the four, stayed behind with The Chief, who was grinning a toothy, blood-smeared smile at us. He just sat there with a look of triumph in his eyes.


We scrambled to find the doctor; we were afraid Chief Scott had hurt him or worse. But what we came across was more severe. We heard the computers announcing the process of the airlock being unlocked for a spacewalk.


From the cockpit, we could see Dr. Taylor's naked form waiting as the doors of the airlock were slowly opening.


"Shit! Shit! What are you doing, Taylor?" Malcolm yelled as he attempted to override the process, but it was too late.


Dr. Taylor mouthed something at us and floated away into space.


He had said, "Your turn."


"What the fuck is going on?" Malcolm exclaimed while he punched the glass of the cockpit.


"Has everybody lost their mind overnight?" he yelled.


I could barely process what had just happened. The Entity was greedy; it wanted all of us. We needed to get back to Earth as soon as possible. 


"We need to get a hold of Ground Control immediately," Fernandez said quietly.


She was leaning in the corner of the cockpit, her hands pressed on her face, tears falling from her eyes. I tried to use the DSN (Deep Space Network), but the radios were extremely damaged, rendering them useless.


"Fuck, the space suits are destroyed!" Malcolm yelled.


All of our space suits were cut up and punctured in vital parts. We were in a terrible situation—we were deserted in space with no way to communicate an SOS signal.


"We need to stay calm," Fernandez said to a trembling Malcolm.


"Go check on Smith; make sure he is fine. Morris and I will check The Chief's room," she instructed.


We split up. My arm still throbbed, but the adrenaline of the moment caused me to barely acknowledge the pain. We went to Chief Scott's cabin, hoping to find a spare radio to attempt a cry for help.


On our way to The Chief's cabin, I noticed the station looked off. There were tools floating all around the place; our lockers were broken into, and everyone's belongings were ruined—phones, chargers, and other things were completely defaced.


As we entered the room, we came across a visceral scene of psychosis. All the cabins are exact replicas; they are sterile, just like hospital rooms, but The Chief's room was in disarray.


His clothes were all trashed in the corner of the room, and the walls were carved into with a knife. He had carved obscure symbols and a crude depiction of the Alpha Centauri system.


He had drawn the three exoplanets that surround Proxima Centauri and had written one of the few words of English on them:


'Disciples.'


The bizarre display had us shaken. Fernandez had started crying again. I was completely fixated on the deranged sight.


There were some orbs drawn, floating towards Proxima from outside of the system. He had written,


'Become one.'


My head was feeling fuzzy again. I had been communing with this monstrosity, being seduced by its false promises of greatness. I was just sustenance to it—nothing more.


Touching the carvings felt intense. I knew full well that I almost became like The Chief and Dr. Taylor. I turned around to tell Fernandez that we wouldn't find anything here.


I was shocked to find that I was alone; Fernandez was gone.


I looked for her desperately; my mind was swirling with frightening scenarios, and the worst one prevailed. Finding her wasn't difficult; the sound of her weeping led me to her location. She had returned to the cockpit.


She was on her knees in the corner of the room, crying and muttering softly as if she were confessing her sins to the corner.


The closer I got, the more perturbed I became. She was wearing nothing but her white tank top, and she was holding what I guessed was the knife that the Chief had been using to carve the walls of his room. Fernandez was pleading on her knees.


"Please forgive him; please let us join you together!"


My head reeled; I felt dizzy. She was begging for mercy on my behalf.


"Stop talking to it! It has been deceiving us! Please!"


I was cut off because Fernandez snapped at me, 


"Shut the fuck up!" Her voice was full of venom as she continued to speak. 


"Can you not see he is furious? We, no you have to beg for his salvation! Don't be stupid, Morris; beg!"


"Do not deny him again; we have to fulfill our mission!" She stared at me intently; the knife in her hand reflected the dim white lights of the space station.


My mouth tasted like copper; I had bitten my cheek.The urge to give in was strong, but the memory of myself as a decrepit husk prevented me from going back to that enticing bliss.


"I can't!" Please!"


She then started screaming and stabbing the wall and the floor. Her voice shifted drastically, taking a deep, rumbling tone; she was howling throes of hunger—it was deafening.


I tried to stop her, but she was completely possessed.The incessant noise and her relentless strength allowed her to knock me out with the blunt side of the knife while I struggled to take it away from her.


The blood from my forehead seeped into my eyes as darkness consumed me. The last thing I saw was Fernandez's face near mine; her pupils were so dilated that her eyes were small pools of black.


The sound of synchronized chanting and the pulsating pain in my head woke me up. My hands were bound, a safety tether tied them tightly. 


Before me I saw four naked figures facing away from me: Fernandez, Smith, Malcolm, and The Chief stood before me, praying to the walls. The Chief turned around, hearing my movements, and smiled at me.


"Welcome back, Morris. I hope you have reassessed your decision to defy him."


I couldn't answer; I just stared at him. The ritualistic background noise of the crew made my headache worse, causing that fuzzy feeling to return. He got closer to me.


"We are more than ready for our ascension, but he is giving you one more chance."


"He can only bestow his gifts if you're willing to accept them. As your Chief, I highly recommend that you welcome his grace; he is virtuous."


"Do not deny him again; you will regret it for the rest of your life."


His words were stabbing through my brain like railroad spikes. The fuzziness in my head was at a fever pitch; my mental sluggishness was at an all-time high. I could hear its voice again, rumbling deep within me, surfacing throughout me.


Its voice used to be reassuring; now, it was just a sweet signal of death. I wanted to succumb, to revel in his eminence, and become one with it, but I knew its real motive, its dark intention. I wanted to reason with the crew, but there was no getting through to them. My crewmates were gone.


I screamed; I would not let it take hold. I wrestled with the fog that threatened to overtake me.


The Chief sighed, disappointed "You were so close, Morris. You have denied him for the third time; you have sinned against God."


Then one by one, they abandoned the station and released themselves into the unknown. I was left alone, fighting to unrestrain myself.


I needed to close the airlock. It was tough, but I managed to do it with my face, pushing the lever that closes the doors of the airlock.


A week passed, and I spent it hungry and fearing death until a spacecraft sent by Ground Control saved me from my predicament.


Ground Control had sent a group of astronauts on a mission to retrieve us the moment they couldn't communicate with us anymore. They were horrified by the state of affairs; they freed me from my restraints and treated me for my wounds then they transported me back to Earth.


Back on Earth, I was interviewed. I lied a lot; any amount of the truth from my perspective would have had me sent to a mental institution immediately.


The official report that Ground Control went with after that was mass hysteria induced by stress and mental illness, and I was the sole survivor of the unfortunate event.


Ground Control gave me a paid leave of absence, a psychologist, and five elegant invitations to my crewmates' funerals.


They told me to take my time to recover and come back strong, but I'm not going back because there is no need.


Most people believe hell is beneath them, but to me, hell is above.


I can still feel his presence within me, occasionally talking to me in my slumber, just like before. It let me go. I'm on Earth at his wishes. He wants me here, waiting patiently on him.


I know he is on his way, and I won't be dead when he arrives.
