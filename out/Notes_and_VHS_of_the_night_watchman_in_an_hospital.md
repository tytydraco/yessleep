Ok, so to be clear, I cannot guarantee that the following is legit. I mean, sure I saw the VHS, I basically wish I'd never find this f****** thing in the first place. Now what, the police would laugh at my face. Macey doesn't give a damn and would not tell the workers, not to risk a shitstorm of resignations. I have to broadcast these tapes, but where? the medias? the internet? They will call it a scam, they'll point at me and my family. At least I've got the notes so, here it is...


I am Paul Webster.
This is the complete notebook panel of Jarvis Garrett, night watchman at the T*****n Physical & Mental Institute, B*****, Ohio.

I had to change the watch path. The corridor to B3 level 1 is blocked by wheelchairs. I put them all back to the storage ward in C6 yet a smart ass seems to want them all parked in the middle of the freaking corridor. 
4 a.m: Still blocked

Pr.Macey asked me to take pictures of all "dysfunctions" with the throw away camera he let on his desk near the anatomic head model. Charlie from the psych aisle told me the bath therapy pools light went on around 2.45 a.m. Get back on the talkie, he went and turned it off, clear.

B3,B4,A2,A5 no records.

Grinn  is f***** around with me...Once again the surgery room 2 is a mess. He thinks I am entitled to clean after him, store back his  tools. Dude better stop it, even if Macey's on his side. 
3.20 am: The bath therapy pools are empty. When did they do that? I am positive it was full yesterday morning when I left

Room 42: "illegible" Blackish stain 

I took a pic of the traffic jam of wheelchair on the corridor to B3. That's it, Macey will have to fire that douchebag...

Pretty certain someone was sitting on the couch in the TV aisle. It was dark but someone...something moved. God I need my maglite back Charlie you paddy ass!

Tricia made a pecan pie. I found it on the restroom table with a note on it "For Jarvee". I took a pic of the vodka  stached under the blue armchair, I know it's Dave's but this old fart better quit the booze or he'll end up on psy ward.

Room 1: Sleeping pills on the nightstand. Stacy says "the granny on the ceiling gave it to me".
Room 24: As expected Allister eats the lining on the padded door. Restraint Type1. Seen by Pr.Macey.

The prosthetic storage room was wide open. Someone is kidding me, now it's on. They put a freaking mannequin in one of the empty pools of the bath therapy. On its back a note says "Mum please, not me" 

The pic taken in the corridor doesn't showcase any wheelchair stucked in. I'm sure 100% there was a huge blockade of wheelchairs when I took the pic.. 
Available at the end of the notepad.
