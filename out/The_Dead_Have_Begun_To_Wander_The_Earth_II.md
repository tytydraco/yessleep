The sunrise looked especially beautiful this morning. Perhaps it was just my sleep-deprived mind, or maybe I was just looking too hard for something beautiful. Nevertheless, watching the warm amber light slowly spread over the hills and engulf the trees might’ve been exactly what I needed. I’ve still yet to hear anything from anyone online, although our constant moving around these last few days probably hasn’t helped my already terrible reception. I don’t know if these words are reaching anyone, but that won’t stop me from writing them. If you've seen my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/hSjgMFbcIZ), or if you’ve heard it from someone, like I did, you might have heard that the military set up some kind of outpost in Seattle. We rolled into Seattle four days ago, and I wish someone told me what I’m about to tell you. The first thing we saw was the cars, hundreds of them, all of them wedged together and abandoned forming a makeshift roadblock. Entrance by vehicle would be impossible.


“Damn.” Travis spoke as he clicked his tongue.


I scanned the area for any signs of life, or military presence, but found none.


“This doesn’t… Shouldn’t there be guys out here or something?”


Travis kept his eyes on the road. “We’ll have to go on foot.”


I got out as he did. “Does something seem off to you? Shouldn’t we see soldiers by now?”


Travis pulled a backpack out from under his seat. “It'd be dangerous to be walking around out here, even with guns. If they’re stationed anywhere, it’ll be inside.”


I suppose it made sense, but I couldn’t shake this strange feeling I had. I felt it in the pit of my stomach rise to my chest, I mistook it for hunger at the time, but in retrospect it was fear. We immediately encountered a problem with leaving the van, we didn’t have the keys for it. Since Travis ‘borrowed’ it, we couldn’t lock it from the outside without breaking a window to get it open again. We decided to load up on as much food and water as we could before leaving, and we could only carry about half of the stuff we currently had. Travis gave me a sidelook as I grabbed my laptop bag, and I tried not to notice. Even though it was dead, even though it made carrying another backpack harder, I just couldn’t leave it. Before we left, Travis reached into the glovebox and pulled something out, along with a few small boxes. He crammed the boxes into his pack and weighed the item in his hand, a gun. As he stared down at it, I followed his gaze. I’m no expert on guns, but I think it was a revolver. It looked like a gun you’d see in a cowboy film, only shorter and thicker, and the little thing you pulled back before shooting was gone.


“Ever shot one of these?”


I shook my head. “No.”


He sighed. “Me neither. Too bad we don’t have a rifle.”


He tucked it into the side compartment of his bag. We started our trek shortly after, wading through a sea of abandoned cars. Most of them had their doors wide open, and my eyes fell on one with its windows covered in blood. I stepped over clothes and children's toys that had been torn from an open trunk, and littered what little road remained. I had to squeeze myself between two cars, accidentally kicking and scattering numerous items. When I passed them, I tripped on a suitcase and almost lost my footing. As I steadied myself on a nearby car, my eyes caught sight of the pale white flesh that almost blinded me in the sunlight. A leg poked out of a once floral dress from the driver's side of the door. Almost like I’d become fully aware of it, the stench hit me. The smell of death was oppressive, assaulting my nostrils and stinging my eyes. Acid crawled its way up my throat and bit my tongue, while I held both hands over my mouth and gagged. It was so awful that even now I have trouble recounting it without feeling sick. My stomach frantically began to churn, and the strange feeling you get just before throwing up started to envelope me. I clenched my hands tighter in an effort to push whatever was coming up back down, but it was having no such effect. Travis must have seen my state by this point, because I felt his hand on my shoulder as he tried to usher me away from it.


“Don’t look at it kid.” Were the only things I could hear as I squeezed my eyes shut.


I’d like to say that I managed to get over it, and we went on our merry way. I’d like to say that I didn’t spend half an hour furiously puking as tears and snot streamed out of my face. But that would be a lie. By the time I was done, I was beyond embarrassed. Travis just handed me a handkerchief and never mentioned it again. By the time we reached the city the taste of vomit was all but gone from my mouth. But our arrival was met with nothing but the sound of wind blowing through the buildings. It was empty, the roads were practically barren, and the streetwalks even more so. One or two cars were parked on either side, although I doubted their owners were coming back for them.


“Where the hell is everybody?” I said as my heart began to slowly sink.


Travis had his head on a swivel. “We’ll wind through the city, keep an eye out for anything living, or dead.”


I sighed. “Travis, what are we doing here? This place looks abandoned.”


But he just started walking. “We came here looking for the military, better start looking.”


Even if this didn’t turn out to be the military safe house we thought it was, maybe we could find other people, at least, that was what I told myself. We spent most of the morning tiptoeing around Downtown, moving slowly and keeping our ears open for anything. As we came across a strip mall, all the display glass lay scattered on the floor, destroyed by ransackers or undead. I still wasn’t comfortable with calling them zombies, it almost didn’t make them feel real, it was like making light of everything that’d happened, everything they’d done. As I peered through the windows my eyes caught sight of the numerous bodies shuffling in the dark. I tapped Travis, pointing over to where I was looking. He nodded.


“Doesn’t seem like they’ve noticed us, keep away from the windows.”


I whispered as we continued on our way. I’d continue to peer into stores as we passed, only to be met with the same vague outline of bodies either standing still, or shuffling around. So long as we moved relatively slowly and kept quiet, it didn’t seem like they paid us any mind at all. But that didn’t stop my heart from almost stopping every time I saw one. I almost yelled out when we turned a corner and I spotted a group of them in the street.


“We’re not going through this way. We’ll double back and take a different road.”


I dreaded them just turning their heads towards us and walking this way, but as long as we remained calm and continued to move slowly they didn’t. There were a couple of times that we’d see a group of them in the street and have to double back in order to avoid them. By midday, we’d seen all that Downtown had to offer. Just as I thought we were done, we came across a few military tents set up next to a building. Just the sight of it made my heart spike with hope, but Travis quickly put his hand on my shoulder.


“Hold up kid. Maybe you should stay out here, let me take a look, alright? Whatever's in there might not be pretty.”


I nodded, and agreed to keep watching, which I honestly did quite poorly. I was so in my own mind about everything that by the time he spoke, I practically jumped.


“Oh shit, sorry, didn’t mean to scare you.” He looked a few years older than me, and a few decades younger than Travis.


“Who, who are you?” Was all I could think of to say.


He half heartily put his hands up in the air, like I had a gun trained on him. “I’m, my name's Matt.”


I stared at him. “Why are you putting your hands up?”


He seemed aware of what he was doing, then slowly put his hands down. “Uh, sorry.”


It was clear how nervous he was, and how unsure of me he seemed. But almost as the universe's way of breaking the ice, Travis emerged from the tents, a few pieces of paper in his hand. As soon as Matt caught sight of Tarvis, he waved.


“Oh, hello!” He called out, which prompted Travis to put a finger on his lips.


Matt looked confused as Travis approached, looking between him and me.


“Who's this?” He asked.


“His name’s, uh… Matt?”


Matt nodded. “Yeah, nice to meet you two, sorry you are?”


“Travis.” He held his hand out, and Matt shook it.


We took a few minutes to get acquainted with the new stranger, apparently he’d driven in from Tacoma and pretty much found exactly what we did.


“God damn, what the hell happened to this place?” Matt spoke as his eyes wandered the streets.


“That’s what we wanna know.” I chimed in. “We just got here ourselves.”


Matt nodded. “Right. I just came here hoping that there was some kind of safe house or something, you know, like a bunker maybe?”


Matt had also heard of the military's presence in Seattle, which prompted Travis to show us the papers he’d found. Apparently the tents were full over overturned tables and chairs, with papers littering the floor, all copies of the same document made up of roughly six or seven pages. From what Travis found, it seems he’d been correct, there had indeed been an initial effort to set up some kind of relief shelter here in Seattle. However after ‘Loss of Significant Outposts and Resources’ it seemed that there was an attempt to evacuate all remaining civilians. I can only imagine how well that went. It was a little difficult to get through most of the military jargon, but Travis pointed out one of the last sections on the final page.


“...Authorise the immediate relocation of all able forces to the east coast…” I read out loud.


Matt took a deep breath. “Shit. So even the army couldn’t handle this huh?”


I looked over at Travis. “So we’re headed to the east coast next?” He nodded.


Matt looked dumbfounded “Woah, what? Seriously? You're going to go all the way to the coast? That's ages away!”


He was right, it took us almost half a day to get here, and it’d take us much much longer to catch up. Travis folded the papers, and began stuffing them into his backpack.


“Better than sitting around waiting for a miracle.”


I could tell Travis was wanting to leave right away.


“Wait, you guys came here in a car?”


Travis nodded.


“Me too… If you guys are leaving, I might as well follow, y’know? I mean, if that's cool with you.”


“Do what you please.”


Matt looked slightly happier. “Thanks… Hey, you guys need any fuel? I’ve got plenty of fuel with me.”


I shook my head. “We’re good, thanks. You need any food? Water? We’ve got heaps.”


He laughed. “That actually sounds great, I’ve got barely enough for myself as it is. I mean, if you don’t mind.”


“It's no trouble at all.” Travis chimed in.


That's when it was decided that Matt would come back to the van with us, take some food, and return to his car.


“Your vans parked outside the city?” He asked as we made our way back to our vehicle.


“Yeah, we couldn't get in, the road was blocked by all the cars.”


“Damn, I got in just fine, actually parked the car a few blocks from here.”


Apparently not all the roads were congested, some of the other entrances were fine enough to drive through. Just as we were coming up on the van, we began to realise something was wrong.


“Fuck.” Travis broke out into a sprint.


“What the hell?” I narrowed my eyes, focusing on the shattered windscreen.


The van looked like shit, the wheels were gone, a spray of blood decorated one side, and five bullet holes decorated the other. Travis threw the side door open, and confirmed our worst suspicions. Everything was gone. They’d left nothing, food, water, clothes, even the extra box of bullets in the glove box, it was like they never existed in the first place. I leant against the hood of the vehicle as I sucked in a deep breath, trying to calm myself down.


“You telling me that you guys didn’t even lock it?” I didn’t answer, so Travis did.


“Can’t, don’t have keys.”


Matt looked confused. “You lost the keys?”


“Never had them.”


Realisation dawned on his face. “Oh, right. Well… We can still take my car, it’s got enough room for all of us.”


Travis pinched the bridge of his nose, then walked over to me. “Still got the clothes on our backs, and a vehicle to ride in. Chin up kid.”


It sucked, it really sucked. But he was right. We still had some of our supplies with us, it wasn’t the end of the world, not yet. I was thankful that Matt had been such a good guy about this, someone else in his place might not have offered to help. Travis must’ve been feeling this way too, because next he said:


“Mighty kind of you, helping us like this.”


But I think he just made him embarrassed, because Matt just said: "Seriously, it's no big deal, we’re all headed the same way y’know?”


I was grateful for the help, but dreaded the fact that we’d have to lug our pack all the way back into the city. By the time we’d gotten back, it was starting to get dark.


“I parked it just a few blocks from where I found you guys, do you remember where-”


Travis would’ve remembered, better than me at least, but Matt never got to finish his sentence. Because instead, we heard the screeching of tires, and the deafening sound of a crash. It sounded like a thousand panes of glass were all shattered at once, the sound echoing through the empty streets and amplifying it. We all froze, Matt had a look of horror on his face, his eyes darting around wildly.


“What the fuck…” I could hear my heartbeat in my ears as I stared at Travis.


He was running, and I followed him. Even with his heavy pack on he was moving at a pace I could barely keep up with. My brain was still processing what it’d heard, but I didn’t need to think about it for too long. I realise now that panic and fear have a way of skewing my recollection of events, how it drapes a veil over my memories and makes it difficult to remember details. I say this because I don’t remember how long we ran for, I just remember seeing the look in Travis's eyes as he stopped. I make the mistake of following his gaze. A car was planted in the side of a building, jutting out sharply. The front of it was gone, flattened by the wall of bricks it’d met. The tire that I could see was unnaturally bent, broken beyond all hope, but that wasn’t why my eyes were drawn to it. Fragments of sharp bone punctured the rubber, it could’ve been anything, it was impossible to tell. I thought that the tire was pulsing at first, it looked like it was contracting and expanding. But it was the bones, the bones that had jammed themselves into the tire were moving independent of each other. Either trying to pry themselves free, or destroy it further. However my mind began to wonder elsewhere, the more I looked at the car the more it began to resemble my friend Ira's car. The same car I rode in with Ben and Amy on our hiking trip. The same trip that might’ve been my last fond memories of Ben. I was so caught up in my own thoughts that I didn’t see the brains of the driver that decorated the wall, and the corpse that desperately scoped it up into its mouth. I didn’t see the woman that was torn out of the passenger side and subsequently pulled apart.


I didn’t hear her screams turn to throaty gargles as her throat and chest were ripped open and feasted on. But what I did hear was the gunshots, three in quick succession. Travis held the gun shakily, but every shot hit its mark, they just had no effect. Each bullet passed through their decaying bodies, but they weren’t even phased, they just continued to shovel her small intestine down their throat. Two more gunshots, one of them sinking into a zombie's head. Half of it blew off, but it acted like it barely noticed. I stared at the scene in horror, that woman's eyes will haunt me until the day I die. They were huge, brown, filled with pleading tears as her body convulsed and blood began to spill from the corner of her mouth. Finally, the last bullet hit her between the eyes. I looked over at Travis, who was already letting the empty bullets fall out of the gun. The next thing I remember is the noise, the low hum of shuffling feet. They were everywhere now, either focusing on the car or on us. They crawled out of buildings and from around corners, the silence had finally been broken. For all the times we’d kept quiet and avoided their notice, at this very moment none of that mattered, we were now their only focus. I stared at the horde of them as they slowly began to close off the road ahead of us.


“Travis…” My hoarse whisper was the only attempt I made to grab his attention.


He whipped his head around, and I followed, just in time to see that our options were becoming unsettlingly few. The way we’d just come was also blocked, a hungry wall of hands and mouths impeding our path. I tried to think of something, anything. But they were everywhere, every door and window I laid my eyes on had a corpse through it, or coming out of it. I felt Travis rush past me as he yelled:


“C’mon kid!” Quickly digging his fingers into a chainlink fence that blocked off some vacant alley.


He moved as fast as he could, but still took about forty seconds to get over it entirely. As he landed hard on the other side, desperately scrambling over it. I came over the top, the tied off metal cutting into my hands and legs as I dropped down. We immediately continued moving, running as fast as we could with our filled up packs. I assumed we were just trying to get away from everything that was trying to kill us, but I should have given him more credit. Travis came to a stop, holding his arm out to stop me as well.


“What?” I asked breathlessly.


“If we go through here… we come back the way we came.” He said through steady breaths, motioning his head towards an open door.


“You, you want to cut through a building? Are you serious? Did you see how many-”


“We need to be quick about this, can’t be dragging our feet. Every damn corpse in the city heard that crash, not to mention those gunshots. We can’t be wasting time sneaking around.”


He began to walk towards it, but my legs were rooted in place. As he got to the door, he peaked his head in briefly.


“Quit standing around, nothing's inside.”


I just hoped that he was telling the truth. It was dark inside, whatever lights once operated now didn’t. Travis had pulled a small flashlight out of his pack, shining it around to get his bearings. He moved quickly, but quietly, trying to navigate to the front in order to leave. My eyes roamed all over the walls, and the boxes that lined them. I wondered what kind of place this was, what it would’ve been before everything happened. We moved through a kitchen, the light from the torch gleamed off the silvery surfaces of the tables. As soon as we entered, my gaze immediately fell on the bloody display left by the corpse slumped over the counter, and I held my breath. Travis stopped for a moment, then crouched down and turned his light off.


“Okay…” He whispered. “Theres a few of them in the next room, just grab onto my pack and stay right behind me. Don’t make a sound, you got that?”


I nodded, just before the question came out of my mouth. “How many are there?”


“Just a few.” He deflected.


“How many is a few?”


“Just stick close kid, okay? And stay low.”


We both crouched down, and I grabbed onto his pack. It wasn’t completely pitch black, the grey daylight from outside poured in through the main window, and just barely illuminated the room. It was enough for me to see how many there really were, how much Travis had played down the situation. Forty, maybe even fifty corpses all stood in silence, their raspy breathes and groans the only ambient noise. I felt panic and fear rise up in me as it had so many other times, and I focused on keeping my breathing shallow to take my mind off things. I moved, and stopped, and moved again with Travis, sticking as close as humanly possible to him. We weaved between the numerous tables, using them as a makeshift cover. The insanity of the situation was a constant thought in the back of my mind, and I tried not to think about the fact that we could be discovered and killed in less than seconds if anything went wrong. But it didn’t, by some stretch of a miracle, we didn’t die that day.

As I was just a few steps away from freedom, I quickened my pace, hoping to make it out quicker. However, as I went to move my left foot forward it locked in place. I was moving too fast to stop myself from tripping, and could only watch in horror as I tumbled forward, crashing into Travis. I scrambled to get to my feet again but no matter how hard I tried, my leg remained locked in place. I glanced down at my foot, and immediately wished I hadn't. Fingers that had been rotted black clamped down around my boot, belonging to an equally rotted arm that snaked out from underneath a table. From where I was laying, I couldn’t see past the shadow that obscured whatever lay underneath. As I drove my other foot into the hand that held me in place, I began to notice that every other corpse in the room had its eyes trained on me. Only sharp breaths came out of my throat as I frantically reached down to pry myself out of its beartrap-like grip. No matter how much I pulled, I never felt any amount of give. I needed help, I needed Travis to help. As I quickly sucked in the air to scream, I was met with the maws of death. Its skin was tight, like all the meat had fallen off its face leaving only bone and skin. One thing I immediately noticed was that its eyes were missing, something I hadn't seen before on any of the others. Its gaping mouth was breathless, I imagine the air they exude would have to be toxic. When I realised it was inching closer to me, I immediately pulled my head back just in time to hear its jaw snap shut. I don’t know why, but the sound always stuck with me, even now I can imagine it clearly. The sound was so loud that it echoed slightly.

I panicked as two hands wrapped around my arms, but felt confusion wash over me as they quickly pulled me outside. As I sprawled out on the sidewalk Travis helped me get to my feet. I went to say thank you, when I realised that the arm was still attached to my foot. I yelled, and Travis tried to get it off, to no avail. My eyes fell on the doorway in front of us. They'd all walked towards the entrance at the same time, bumping up against each other and blocking a single one of them from walking through. Despite their clumsy uncoordinated decisions, they all moved as one. The doorframe was obstructed by a single entity, reaching out to beckon me into its many hungry mouths. Travis saw it too, before reaching into his pack and pulling out a screwdriver. He levered it under each finger, trying to pull me free as the metal dug into its bone. I tried to help, though I doubt I really did all that much. But with a wet snapping sound, the first finger was off, then the second, then the third. Each bent backwards at the joint before falling onto the pavement and slowly writhing. As we managed to get myself unlatched from the arm the entrance gave way, and a pile of corpses spilled over onto each other. Travis didn’t need to say anything, he just started running, and I followed him.

“Thanks.” I said quickly, but he either didn’t hear me, or didn’t have time to acknowledge it.

From there, it didn’t take us long to find Matt. “Jesus. What the fuck was that? What happened?”

He spoke as he emerged from his hiding place, an upturned trashcan. I didn’t say anything, I just let Travis tell him that we needed to leave.

“No shit.” He replied as he led us to his car.

We got turned around for a little bit, but eventually he found it, a beaten up brown station wagon. As he unlocked it I dove into the back and was met with various chip packets and cans of empty soda. I threw my pack and laptop bag off as I saw Travis throw his bag in as well. Matt pulled himself into the driver seat and shoved the key into the ignition. The first and second turns didn’t do it, but the third time the engine roared to life. I felt myself ease into the car seat just a little bit, hoping that I could put everything I’d seen and experienced behind me.

“They’re blocking the road.”

Four words that immediately reminded me that we weren’t in the clear just yet. I pulled myself up, looking over at Travis, who’d spoken them.

“What? Oh, I see what you mean.” Matt squinted his eyes as he spoke.

The street at the very end of the road was now blocked off by a large group of them, slowly dragging themselves towards us. Matt tightened his grip on the steering wheel.

“We’ll just have to run them all down.”

But Travis immediately spoke up. “No! Jesus, you don’t want them under the car, that's how you crash.”

He stood there, thinking for a moment before he spoke again. “I’ve got an idea, but you’ll have to wait here.”

With that, he just left. Matt looked over at me. “What the fuck was that?”

What else could I do but shake my head. “No idea, but he’s reliable, you can trust him.”

Matt didn’t look convinced. A couple of minutes later was when we heard it, the sound of a car horn. It was long and continuous. Matt looked around for a moment and I smiled to myself when I saw our roadblock start to dissolve.

“You gotta be kidding me.”

Matt had the same stupid smile I did as he watched the horde abandon us and pursue their new louder target. We waited for Travis for a few minutes, although I didn’t start keeping track until after I realised how long he’d been gone.

“You think he’s coming back anytime soon?” I couldn’t tell if Matt was serious or joking.

“Yeah he’ll be back.” I said defensively.

But after ten minutes I started to panic. “Shit, c’mon old man…” Matt muttered as his eyes looked up into the rear view mirror.

I peered my head over the seats, and saw four new corpses that had taken an interest in us.

“Goddamn, hurry the fuck up.” He said, his eyes darting all over the place.

I just want to say, I never once considered leaving Travis behind, but I got seriously close when the corpses got within a few feet of the car. When the door was thrown open, my heart almost jumped out of my chest.

“Fuck! Holy shit Travis.” Matt took it worse than I did.

“Go, but take it slow, don’t run any of them over.”

I’m thankful to say that the rest of our trip was uneventful. We took the same road out that Matt took in, and were out of the city by sunset. We stopped at the first gas station we found and filled up some jerry cans Matt had in the back. He also had a portable gas generator, which I convinced him to let me use to charge up my laptop. He was just as surprised as I’d been to find out that the internet was still up, for the moment anyway. The whole Seattle thing was a few days ago, we’re back on the road now. We don’t have nearly as much food as we used to, but I’ve found that my appetite seems to get smaller as the days pass. I don’t know if it's the stress or the dead bodies, but I’m somewhat grateful for it. We’ll continue to move towards the coast, even if it feels like an impossible task. I just hope it's not like Seattle. If anyone sees this, if this somehow finds you, stay away from Seattle. It doesn’t matter what you heard, or who you heard it from. Whatever used to be there is gone now. I would probably also extend that to most cities, they seem really good at hiding in urban areas. But maybe I’m just paranoid, who can blame me? But I need to end this here, Travis wants to show me how to use a gun, and I’ve procrastinated enough. Stay safe, and stick together, we’re all we’ve got.
