I’m Mel. I’m 17, I have no friends, I’m obsessed with true crime and horror movies, I have one glass eye, and my mom works at a hospital and is never around, so if I want spending money I have to work for it, which is how I ended up here at Midwest Mart. Like most Midwest Marts, it’s the only 24 hour grocery store in my small town. Oh, and I’m a raging insomniac like my mom, which is why I, like her, ended up on night shift. That, and no one else would take it.

So there I was, the only one in the store. Hardly anyone steps foot through the door after 11 PM, so I had no one to keep me company but the buzz of the LED lights and the 24 hour corporate-owned Midwest Mart radio station playing one season out of date pop songs over the loudspeakers, occasionally interrupted by advertisements for Midwest Mart exclusive products. I was sitting at the checkout counter with my journal open. My therapist says journaling about your day is good for taking perspective, but nothing ever happens to me. Nothing ever happens in this town, period. So I have nothing to write about.

I was trying to write a diary entry from the perspective of a squirrel who had just discovered coffee when I heard the electric whir of the automatic doors. I looked up, more surprised than anything, to see a rather tall man walk in. Or rather, he wobbled in, his face obscured by the high collar of his trench coat and the wide brim of his hat. He uttered a gruff “hello.”

I didn’t say anything back. I don’t really know why, but it kind of made me feel shitty. I feel like I often ignore people when they talk to me to keep up my “edgy girl” persona, but I really want to smile and say hi. I guess I just assume that when people look at me, they expect a certain attitude to come with the color of my hair, how I do my make up, and the clothes and jewelry I wear. Is it really rebellion if I just do what everybody already expects me to do?

Anyway, I was curious about this guy and I had nothing to do, so I grabbed the mop and bucket and started mopping the aisles just to get a glimpse of him. Plus, if I passed by him, maybe I would get the chance to apologize for being rude earlier. Who knows, maybe I’ll get the chance to actually have a conversation with a real person for once. You have to understand, when I say nothing interesting happens in this town and no one is worth talking to, I mean *nothing* and *no one*. So I wanted to check this interesting character out for myself.

When I got to his aisle, I was shocked. I could see several small hands, definitely more than two and definitely too small to belong to a human adult of his size, peeking out of the trench coat and grabbing cans of beans and corn before returning to the depths of the coat.

“What the fuck” I didn’t mean to call out. My body had an involuntary reaction before my mind could even comprehend what it was seeing. I seemed not to be the only one who was taken off guard, because at the sound of my voice, the figure stiffened and the trench coat dropped. There stood a stack of goblins, with gray skin, beady black eyes, and crooked noses and ears staring back at me, looking equally as bewildered as I felt.

An eternity passed between us without a word. The spell of silence seemed to break when the mop fell from my hands and clattered to the floor. All at once, the top goblin hissed and flung a can of baked beans directly at my face, knocking out my glass eye with a sickening *pop.* I didn’t bother stopping to recover it, just turned and ran the other way, cupping my hand over my exposed eye socket. In a comically cruel twist of fate, I seemed to slip over my own eye, falling forward and crawling away from the goblins as they scrambled down from one another and had to come together to decide if they should chase me, gather up their plunder or reassume their disguise.

I managed to hide behind the end fixture of the aisle. Sitting on the floor with my back against it, I reached back to grab anything that could help me, and my hand found the neck of a handle of shitty domestic vodka, which I brandished upside down like a club. As I heard little feet pattering toward me, I steadied my breathing, and swung the bottle around the corner. I wish it were made of glass, so that it could shatter and spray liquid and broken glass everywhere for my attackers to fall into, and I would be left with a sharp weapon. Instead, it was made of plastic, so all I got was an almost hilarious *thud* as I smacked one of the goblins and sent him flying into the shelves. He grunted as canned goods collapsed on top of him.

I’m not an athlete by any means, but my mom is always telling me to pick up a sport like she did because I have a lot of big emotions and no physical outlet. And my therapist is always saying exercise is good for your mental health. There was a lot of pent up rage and fear behind that swing, and in that moment, I started to get it. If I got out of this alive, I thought, maybe I’d take up softball like she did.

With a vital distraction on my side, I scrambled away from the goblins and opted to army crawl down the next aisle, so as not to alert them with my footsteps. I tried to keep my breathing as quiet as possible as I peeked under the display cases, I saw their little feet and shadows move around, and heard their voices for the first time.

“We should just leave,” one of them said.

“No!” responded the other. “We have to find her. Kill her! She saw us.”

“How did she see us?” the third asked. “Humans never see through our disguise!”

I trembled as I saw my own eye roll across the floor and stare back at me. What was I going to do? See the craziest thing to ever happen in this backwater town and not even live to tell the tale? My mind scrambled to hold on to anything of value as I entered a life or death situation for the first time in my life. I looked from my glass eye to the handle of vodka in my hand. Then my mind went back to the other universe, where the bottle was glass and the goblins were slipping all over vodka and I had a sharp broken bottle in my hand.

"That’s it!" I thought, and snapped back to reality. I reached, as slow as a snail and silent as the grave, under the display case and grabbed my eye, before slowly pulling my hand back and popping it back into my head. It was a risky move, I had no idea which direction my attackers were facing so they definitely could’ve spotted me; but if I was going to die that night, I would die with that little piece of dignity intact. I wouldn’t make my mom pay for a replacement for the funeral.

I slowly unscrewed the cap on my bottle of vodka and let the contents crawl out at the speed of gravity, crawling a translucent layer across the floor. The smell almost made me wretch. Then, I wung the plastic bottle across the floor of the grocery store, and it made a satisfying *thump.* The goblins, as if on cue, made a mad dash towards the source of the noise, slipped on the almost invisible liquid covering the ground before them, and careened into the displays with a deafening *crash!* 

I used the sound as cover to get up and start running, as silently as I could in doc martens, back to the counter where the cigarettes were kept. I grabbed a matchbook and baseball slid back to the pool of vodka, pulling all the matches from the book and striking them at once. I dropped the fistful of fire into the liquid and watched it ignite. As the fire caught and spread across the floor it engulfed the display cases the vodka had spread under, and now I could hear the little thieves panicking as they scrambled to get away from the fire.

I knew that for my plan to work, time was of the essence. I doubled back to the canned food aisle and my eye fell upon the thing I was looking for: the mop. I looked up, and at the other end of the aisle was a goblin. Our gazes met, and a malicious, sharp-toothed grin spread across his face. That was when the sprinkler system kicked on and the fire alarm went off.

A wall of steam obscured us from each other’s view as the sprinklers hissed and spat water everywhere. I made another running baseball slide for the mop, and my hands found the mop at the exact same time as another pair of grubby, gray hands.  Once again I channeled all my teenage rage and swung the mop with all my might, striking the little goblin and sending him sliding across the wet floor. I barely had time to celebrate my victory when I felt needle-sharp teeth dig into my leg. I turned and saw another goblin stuck to me like a bulldog, jaws locked on my thigh.

With a plunger motion I used the tip of the mop to beat the thing off of me and limped towards the exit. I could hear more feet scuddling behind me, and I was not moving at full speed. I made it through the automatic door, and jammed the mop behind it, stopping it from sliding back open as the third goblin smashed into the glass behind me, cracking it. It went ballistic, pounding at the door with all it’s might, but enough Midwest Marts had been robbed now that that glass was bulletproof. It should hold at least until the Fire Department showed up, who were called as soon as the alarm system went off.

As I heard the horns and sirens approaching and my world suddenly became bathed in red and white light, I pressed my back against the door and slid down, a mixture of laughter and tears escaping my face.
