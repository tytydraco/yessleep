Everyone says it’s a miracle that I’m still alive and it’s unexplainable that my brother is dead.

I’m not as good of a writer as him; I found this account pulled up on his laptop after we discovered his body in his bedroom, signed in on my phone with the usual sign-in information that I know he used to use on all his stuff. I read all of the posts he made here in the days leading up to his death. They all have the tone and structure we’ve gotten to know in his writing. I’m trying to do his prior story justice, but I can’t possibly hope to replicate his writing style perfectly. Still, he always loved the endings to stories, specifically when they would answer all the little mysteries that had been building up over the course of the plot.

I’m sorry to say I am unable to answer all the mysteries surrounding my brother today, but I feel convicted to share what I can. To be honest, I wrestled with adding anything to this account, given how dramatic and poetic of an ending my brother left his last post at. But ultimately, I do believe he’d want anybody who has interacted with his story to have as much information as possible. So, I’m huddled away in my room well past dark, typing this out on a crappy touch screen phone. It’s going to take me a while, every time I think about him I have to stop tears from flowing out of my eyes.

It doesn’t help that I can hear the muffled sounds of my mother crying from across the house. Life is going to be very different from now on. I can’t imagine that any of us will ever be as happy as we once were. I can barely think about the fact that mom and dad very nearly lost *both* of their children last night, and my stomach gets horribly twisted every time my thoughts even approach the stark reality that I will never see my brother again in this lifetime.

To be clear with everyone, I’m still in shock; it’s only been a little over a day since everything happened to me, and blotches of my memory have been difficult to grasp ever since the incident. The physical trauma and ensuing intense relief being immediately upturned by the horrific tragedy that was my brother’s dead body lying before his window on the floor of his room just about broke something in my brain, I think.

My name is Anya, and I’m his younger sister. The last time I saw William alive was when he dropped me off at my friend’s house for a sleepover me and a few of the other freshman girls had planned a couple of weeks ago. That whole interaction is in a weird space in my mind now. It somehow feels like it happened forever ago and *just happened* at the same time. He had looked a little tired, but he had been acting perfectly normal for him. Teasing me, asking me about my day. I would have never noticed that there was anything wrong and I would have never guessed he was in a rough mental spot if I hadn’t read the posts he’s been making over the past week.

I struggle to sort out what I think about the story those posts convey. Each of them boasts a gripping title, they all contain seemingly impossible elements. He was a writer. He loved to fantasize, invent plotlines, tell stories. For my own psychological comfort, I want to believe he was just writing one last story. I would like to go even further and imagine that he actually had no idea he was going to die, and it was all one morbid coincidence.

The numerous anomalies surrounding my survival and his death compel me to think otherwise, though. I’m not sure if my brother’s account of his last days contains the entire or unfiltered truth, but I can’t help but think there *is* truth in them. So, in the spirit of getting both his and my truth into writing, this is what happened to me the night my brother died.

The overnight began with some gossip, as our get togethers so often did. I’ll be the first to admit that there’s something deliciously entertaining about discussing the life and problems of other people, especially when there’s plenty of commentary me and my friends can add. Several different topics of conversation phased in and out as we collectively considered what to do with ourselves first. The plan was to eventually group up in my friend’s finished basement and watch a musical that we had all been dying to see, but we wanted to save that for when it got late. That being said, we basically just lounged around and followed whatever whims came our way; more gossip, social media scrolling, guilty snacking, arguing over musical taste and celebrity crushes, sometimes all of that simultaneously.

When we had finally succeeded in wasting our time until nightfall, we watched our show. I thought it was mid, which felt disappointing at the time, but now most things I’ve been disappointed over feel pointless.

The true catalyst (my brother loved that word, I hope I’m using it right) to the incident happened when my friend suggested that we go for a midnight walk in the large woodland are that was included in her parents’ property. Apparently, there was a fantastic spot to view the moon and stars, and she suggested that we could each talk about our ideal romantic partner and love life while staring at the beauty of the nighttime sky.

I, along with the rest of the girls, thought it would be a great time. Personally, it felt just enough like we were ‘sneaking out’ to give off that aura of taboo behavior, but safe enough that it was completely harmless. The perfect way to chase a high with your friends without consequence. So, after bundling up in our winter clothing, we headed out into the cold night, careful not to awaken my friend’s parents who had gone to bed.

This is around the point where my memory gets fuzzy and I am reliant on everyone else’s recounting of the night to explain what happened next. To save the trouble of trying to straighten out all the details for an elaborate description, I’m just going to bluntly get to the point: the location my friend wanted us to get to required the crossing of a small frozen lake if we wanted to arrive in any sort of timely manner.

My friend had crossed safely numerous times, she swore up and down. It certainly seemed like the ice was thick enough to support our weight. We were wrong.

Like I said, I don’t really remember any of this. I’m actually kind of glad about that. I can’t imagine how powerful the short-lived terror would have been. I’m sure that would be seared in my mind forever if I could properly recall it.

According to the accounts of my horribly guilt-racked friends, the ice collapsed beneath us when we were over one of the deeper parts of the lake. All but one of our group fell in, but the others were able to scramble out. I apparently had the misfortune of slipping and hitting my head on the ice when I fell, most likely getting knocked unconscious before I even sunk into the water.

None of my friends possessed the bravery or the swimming ability to attempt a rescue. I don’t blame them; I’m not definitively sure if it was cold enough that night for hypothermia to set in super quickly, but regardless, it was dark and cold, and my body had been completely submerged and shoved under a broken ice layer. Trying to save me would have probably cost them their lives or health. So, in a panic, a couple of them called 911 while the other two ran back towards the house to alert the adults.

Things didn’t move the fastest from there due to the woefully unideal conditions of the incident. It was the dead of night in the middle of winter, and I needed saving from the center of a frozen lake. Miraculously, my body was able to get recovered by responders that night, but every one of them had been in agreement that it would be too late.

I had been not only in frigid water for too long, but I had also been actively under it beyond a reasonable amount of time for human survival. I should have *definitely* drowned. And if by some stretch of the imagination I didn’t, I should have some serious, life-threatening problems from the icy temperature of the water surrounding me for that long.

Yet, not only was I alive, but when I returned to consciousness shortly after being rescued, I didn’t appear to be suffering from any injuries, internally nor externally. It baffled everyone, and the mandatory trip to the hospital didn’t offer any insight to this phenomenon. They couldn’t force me to stay there given that every test they conducted resulted in my total and complete health.

Personally, I can say that I felt great; I didn’t even have proper recall of the incident.

My parents had rushed over from their date night to my friend’s house after receiving what must have been the heart stopping call from her parents. They said they had never been more scared in their life during the horrible period of time that elapsed between my fall into the lake and my rescue. I get extremely stressed out just thinking of the frantic frenzy that must have ensued when my friends had scattered to alert people of the terrible danger I had gotten into.

For what now feels like the smallest moment in time, I experienced love and relief from my parents like I never had before. All of us were hugging and crying and thanking the heavens that I had survived a life-ending scenario through some unexplainable miracle. It honestly had a certain magic to it that I don’t believe can be replicated.

Then we went home.

I can’t properly describe to you what it’s like to go from such a once in a lifetime high of surviving the impossible to the soul crushing low of finding your brother’s fresh corpse sprawled on the floor of his bedroom.

I was the one to discover him.

“William!” I had called his name excitedly as we returned home when the sun had already risen for the new day; mom and dad had said he didn’t answer any of the numerous phone calls they gave him which they chalked up to him being already asleep when my incident occurred and his phone more than likely being on vibrate, or silent, or something like that.

I didn’t care if he was sleeping, I *had* to tell him about the death-defying adventure I had just been through.

He was always the first to hear about anything concerning my life; I loved telling him what was happening with me, my friends, my social and academic life, I just loved talking to him about *anything*. He always had such genuine care and interest in his voice, something that was unparalleled in any of my other friends.

I practically skipped over to his room, threw open his bedroom door, giddy to shake him out of his slumber and tell him my crazy story.

I didn’t scream right away; instead, I was frozen in disbelief, unable to move until my parents had come up behind me.

The curtains and blinds of his window were wide open, the light of the gradually rising sun from the dawn of a new day flooding into the room, illuminating the awkwardly sprawled form of his body on the floor.

When the truth of what I was seeing finally hit me, I let out a grief-stricken shriek as I buried my face into my mother, sobbing as my father dove to the ground, cradling William and weeping after he checked his pulse, confirming that he was dead.

Never before have I lived through such sorrow. Not only from within my own heart, but from the people around me. I’ve never seen my dad cry. That night I saw my father breakdown in a way I thought was impossible for him, an absolutely gut-wrenching sight to behold. My mother was of course in hysterics for hours to come, and my brain seemed to lock itself in an unending cycle of denial.

I’m never going to stop crying unless I move on with this, so I apologize if it seems like I’m adopting a heartless tone for this next part. It’s the only way I’m going to be able to finish this without constantly stopping to wipe the tears off of the screen as well as my face. So, here we go.

Absolutely nothing was physically wrong with my brother. He was definitely dead, not breathing, no heartbeat. But there was not a single sign of physical wound or stress on his body, and I know for a *fact* that he wasn’t taking anything that could have killed him from the inside, like drugs, or something like that. First of all, there was zero sign of any sort of illegal or otherwise life-threatening substance anywhere near is body, or in the house at all (unless we’re counting stupid household item stuff which would require an unholy amount of consumption to kill him that fast, and nothing seemed to have been remotely messed with). Second, my brother was *super* picky about what went inside him. He was a vegetarian, an outspoken anti-alcohol person, all around germaphobe, and repeatedly made fun of people who enjoyed getting high through various methods. And to the idea that he somehow took his own life which my parents jumped to way too fast- my brother would *never* do that.

He loved life, he especially loved his hobbies, and I know he loved me. I will never accept the idea that he purposefully brought himself to an end, not when he had so many aspirations and goals he wanted to reach, primarily ambition when it came to his writing and his deeply embedded desire to find a woman to fall in love with.

Like I said, I can’t answer all of, or realistically speaking, *any* of the mysteries here.

I read his posts over the past few days, and I’m not sure what to make of them or how to apply them to his situation. I don’t know if I can so easily jump to the conclusion of believing in other worldly entities that are capable of stalking and interacting with people without anyone else being able to see them just based off of the writings of a storyteller and his untouched corpse.

But no matter what way I look at it, last night, something unexplainable saved me from meeting my end and something unexplainable took my brother’s life. Regardless of how much in my brother’s account of his last days alive is true, whether every bit of it is objective fact or if it is all one grand delusion, I don’t feel like I have any closure at all when it comes to the nature of how he met his fate.

The only thing I’m sure of is that he held more love for me and confidence in the trajectory of my life than I ever fully realized. Reading what he thought would be his last written words, his final chance to communicate with someone, practically broke me just as much as the discovery of his body did. More than anything else, he wanted me to know that he believed I was going to change the world for the better.

That sentiment feels like the only light in this overwhelmingly dark time. My brother has all the optimism in the universe when it comes to the impact of my existence.

I promise I’m not going to let you down, William. I’ll study hard, train hard, make friends wherever I go, do anything I can to improve the world, just like you always believed I could. I’ll do all of it in honor of you.

I just wish you’d be here to see it.
