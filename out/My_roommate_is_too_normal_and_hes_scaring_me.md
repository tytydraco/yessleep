It’s hard to know where to begin with something like this. “Start at the beginning”, well yeah, no shit, that’s obvious.

But how do you know where the beginning is? Life isn’t neat; it isn’t broken down into little plots with defined starts and ends. It’s one big mess of choices and coincidences that merge and weave together to make what is normally a very boring story.

So I’ll preface this by giving you what you need to know about me.

I’m not smart. Ask anyone who knows me. These days, they’ll say I’m reliable, responsible, personable, and lots of other –ibles and –ables that mean nothing. But I’ve been very stupid at times, made some very dumb mistakes and choices that I still pay for. But I’d say nearly everyone has at some point.

 So, second, I want you to know I’m not a bad guy. To say I’m a good man would be a stretch, I’ll agree, but I’m not cruel, or unkind, or even particularly hateful. I don’t even hate my mother, however much she might deserve it.

Anyways, here goes:

My roommate is normal.

That might not sound bad, almost sounds like a compliment, even.

But it’s terrifying.

He’s just left, gone to do… something. I really couldn’t say. But it feels like when you’re in the deep end of the pool and come up for air, or when you’ve been lost in the woods for hours and just found a trail you recognize. It’s that kind of relief, and all because this guy is seriously screwing with me.

Somehow, no one even notices him; he just blends in. And yet, he’s ruining my life.

Let me rewind to this particular story’s beginning, as all stories probably should, except the super weird or time-travel related.

It was summer, a month-or-so ago. I had just been promoted to a full-time job (Assistant Manager of a Whataburger). I was hoping to finally follow in my big sister’s tiny shoes and find a place of my own, moving out of her spare room. I live in a pretty big city. Not Austin or Dallas or anything, but big enough rent is pretty crazy if you want your own pad that isn’t in a ghetto or between two crack dens.

I found the perfect place, about a 20-minute drive from my Whataburger, not too central but central enough. 770 bucks a month, two bedrooms. I could survive, just. But in the long-term I’d need a roommate. Going halves on that and I’d be able to save, invest, that sort of shit. So I hit up social media, tried to find someone to fill my gap.

Didn’t take all that long, maybe a week or two screening out the weirdos. My sis helped me vet the guy. His name was Mike, 26, same as me. Worked an entry-level white-collar type office job somewhere in the city. Typical hobbies, didn’t smoke, drink, or do drugs, which was good for me. We decided to meet him.

My sis, Jen, came towards the end of my shift. It was nearly 3 in the afternoon, so plenty quiet, and we mostly just shot the shit while I wiped a few tables and looked busy, not that the main manager was in.

Then he came.

I’d said, “I finish at 3, so maybe come round then?”

And I could swear, the moment that the clock struck 3, he came through the doors. We recognized him from the app we’d found him on. I can’t remember what exactly it was now.

Either way, neither of us found anything odd then, when we first met Mike. He was civil, good posture, fairly well-spoken, with a normal smile set in a normal face.

“What did you think?” I asked Jen.

She’d shrugged, “Better than a crackhead. Dude seems normal. What did he say he does for fun again?”

I couldn’t remember then, and I sure as hell have no idea now.

He only walked out maybe 10 minutes ago, but if you ask me for the specifics I think I’d struggle. He had one of those faces. Like an extra from an old TV show, the kind of guy who’s there somewhere in every episode, but you never even notice until someone points them out.

He just blends in. He isn’t ugly, and he isn’t handsome. He has no notable scars or marks, and if you put a gun to my head, and really forced me, I’d guess his hair and eyes were brownish. But I wouldn’t want to be in a position where I’d stake my life on it.

For the first week or so he was great. Well, average. He normally cleaned up after himself okay, and wasn’t too loud. We didn’t really talk, didn’t hang out at all. He just didn’t seem the type.

He had his life, and I had mine. Or so I thought.

My job involves some pretty long hours. The head manager of my restaurant is also the franchisee, Mr Dixon, or Dick, as we all call him. He takes what he calls a “Hands-off approach”. That means he’s basically never in, and I’m stuck doing almost everything. Some days I work as long as 12 hours. I don’t mind though, keeps my mind off things, and the overtime pay is pretty sweet.

Most mornings Dick’ll stick his head, and its many chins, in the door, and say “Something’s come up, I gotta go downtown. You got this, champ?”

“Sure.” I’ll say.

“Good man, good man, keep this up and you’ll go far.”

And that’ll be the last I see of him. Sometimes he might turn up at close, grab a diet Dr Pepper, and sit there sucking at it while we shoot the shit and I sort the kitchen. On a Saturday night, he might occasionally take me to some bar, catch a game or something. He always pays too.

I don’t mind, I kinda like the responsibility. If you’ve never worked in fast-food, it’s pretty tiring physically. You’re on your feet all day, keeping track of a hundred things at once. As a manager I should probably be doing more, well, managing, but invariably at least 1 or 2 of the high school stoners we employ won’t show, so I have to jump on the grill.

It’s fine, makes me tired enough I can just go home and collapse at the end of the day, and don’t have to think about anything too hard.

If I’m not working on Sunday, I might get out my battered old Honda Civic and visit my sister. She’s got a good job, receptionist at a fancy golf club about an hour south of town. We don’t talk to our parents much, not anymore. It’s always been us against the world.

When I was younger, a lot of my friends never really understood how I could be so close to Jen. I heard all sorts of horror stories about siblings fighting constantly, stealing pocket money from each other, spreading each other’s secrets all over school, that sort of thing. I never got it. My big sis was always the only person I could rely on.

I wish she was here now.

Everything changed a couple of days ago.

It was a pretty normal Saturday. I left around 7am, and Mike was already up, sat in the living room, eyes fixed on the TV, facing away from me.

“I’m heading out.” I said as I passed through.

“I’ll be here.” He replied, as always.

It was after the lunch rush had been and gone, and I was sitting pretty behind the counter, talking with one of our new hires. The moment the clock struck 3, there Mike was. I don’t think I even heard the door open.

It was a weird feeling, one moment I’m talking with this kid, he’s telling me he’s saving for a car, and everything feels     normal. Then, there was this pressure, this feeling, like the entire world is watching me. I cut myself off. Felt my hairs on my arms rise, and there was this… embarrassment. A gut-wrenching sensation, like when your parents have found your weed stash and you know you’re about to have all your secrets laid bare.

I turned, and there he was. Cargo shorts, white T-shirt, looking for all the world like the most average customer you could have, and he was staring at me hard. So I pushed down that feeling, greeted him as warmly as I could muster, being that he is my roommate, and took his order.

He did nothing, and it was the most intense moment of my life. He ordered normally, a double meat meal. The kitchen beeped, and employees moved around me. And I was stuck, trapped like a deer in the headlights as my roommate continued to stare at me. A cold sweat ran down my face and arms, and I blurted out the rest of my lines, telling him to wait by the side, but I’m pretty sure I jumbled it all up. The beeps from the kitchen drowned out everything but the blood rushing in my head.

He moved over, though, never taking his eyes off me. I was shaking as I packed up his box, keeping my head down, looking only into the sauce trays under the counter. I couldn’t bring myself to ask which he wanted, so I just threw a few of each in. Dick would kill me if he was there.

I was feeling dizzy, lightheaded, borderline nauseous as I handed over the box. I didn’t want to look, really didn’t, but I couldn’t stop myself, and I took a quick glance into his normal face.

His eyes burned, and scalded my soul. That embarrassment returned 100 times stronger, and those night terrors you have about being naked at school felt like nothing in comparison. It was as if he could see every secret, every part of my being, laid out like a dissected animal.

My heart beat so loudly in my ears even the kitchen beeps fell away, and for a second I felt like I was gonna throw up or pass out or something. I’d never felt anything like it, never felt so known, so judged.

Just as I could take no more, he thanked me for his meal, and he left.

My shirt was stuck to me, even with the AC on full blast. I had to run to the bathroom, and I probably sat there for 10 minutes once I was done, just waiting for the shaking to subside.

 When I came out, I went over to the kid who’d been at the counter with me.

“Uh, hey.”

“You good, man?” He said, giving me an odd look.

“Uh, sure, why?”

He shrugged and made a face. “You look kinda rough dude. You sick?”

I shook my head, trying to place a reassuring smile on my face that probably came out as a grimace. “All good, just a little hot in here, don’t you think?”

The employee made a noise that could have meant anything.

“Anyways,” I started, “that guy who came in just now. He seem kinda… off to you?”

“Huh?” He looked perplexed. “Which guy?”

I tried to recall anything visually that stuck out about him, but it was like trying to find words to describe the taste of water.

“That guy just now, cargo shorts, white tee? You were right here with me, man.” I said, trying to keep the edge desperation out of my voice.

The employee’s eyes flicked with recognition. “Oh, that guy? Nah man, he seemed normal. I barely even noticed him. Why?”

I struggled to find anything to reply with. “Dunno. He was almost, like, too normal, y’know?”

The new hired just looked puzzled. “Uh, sure, I guess.”

I dropped it real quick. It’s like I say. My roommate is just normal. It’s a weird paradox, he’s so normal no one even seems to notice him, but like, that just makes him too normal.

It was that effect he had on me. I’d never seen it before. At home, all he really did when he wasn’t in his room was maybe watch TV or eat something. Before now, I don’t think he ever really looked my way at all.

In fact, now that I think about it, he almost blended in with the beige wallpaper and the gray couch. I couldn’t say I’d ever even taken notice before. He was like a lamp or an unused chair that happened to pay half the rent.

By the end of my shift, around 10 that night, I was still feeling pretty shaken. In fact, I wasn’t feeling like going home. He was always in bed around midnight, so when Dick turned up and hit me with that “Coming to the bar, sport?” I said sure.

I’m sure you know the kind of bar it was. Faux wood paneling on the walls, tacky neon signs, pool tables with ripped up felt, floor always slightly sticky, and Creed blaring on the jukebox. A real dive. The sort of place Dick seemed to like for some reason. Couldn’t ever figure out why, he had money, lots of it, but he seemed to like the dreary miasma of run-down bars.

Dick was spilling over his stool, gulping at his Bud, and I was nursing mine over the bar.

“So anyways,” he goes on, “I always wonder how you manage to stay thin. I mean shit, you built like a crackhead.”

That elicited an ironic smile from me. “Just genes I guess, man.”

That got a chuckle out the big man. “Well shit, I don’t remember the last time I fit in a pair of jeans.”

I laughed along with him. But today’s encounter was eating at me, and a few beers had done a lot to loosen me up.

“Hey, look Dick.” I began, struggling to find what to say. “I had a real weird customer today. Kinda freaked me out.”

Dick’s glazed expression snapped serious. “Was it that damned tweaker who’s always on 16th and Dallas? I told that fuck he weren’t welcome since his last OD in the shitter.”

“No, no. It wasn’t a tweaker. It was this guy. He was, like, normal. Too normal, you know?”

“Uh, no. Can’t say I do.”

I kept pressing, though what answer I wanted I didn’t know. “He looked normal as hell. But he stared at me. It was super intense, like he could see into my fucking soul.”

But Dick’s eyes were glazing over as he sank what was left of his beer. “Heh, I remember when the ladies gave me that kinda look. Maybe he had a little crush on you?” And he started giggling.

 

……

 

 

I came back to my senses a few hours later, maybe 2am. I was staggering back towards the apartment. I say that, I was still drunk, just this part I can remember. I assume I’d shared Dick’s Uber, and was only about a block away from the apartment. The world was spinning, and I was trying to keep upright whilst shuffling in vaguely the right direction.

I don’t drink much anymore, not more than 2 beers usually. But today had shaken me, and I’d pounced on that warm feeling that booze gives you, like everything’s gonna be fine and damn whatever comes tomorrow.

Tomorrow hit me hard as I rounded the corner.

One minute I was in the reassuring embrace of a drunken stupor, then, I was standing stone-cold sober looking at the unsuspecting 2-storey building that was my home. It was cold, I realized, despite my jacket. Yet the sweat came anyway. There was some sense, something prehistoric, primordial. I knew I was prey, being stalked, watched by the ultimate predator, and I knew there was nothing I could do in the face of such overwhelming power.

He was watching me, my roommate. He was standing at the window, had been standing there maybe for hours. I couldn’t see him, not from this far, but I felt it with utter certainty. The adrenaline was flowing, I could feel my heart banging in my chest, and I took a step forward. And another.

I was drawn in. What the hell else could I do? It was 2am, and that was my home.

Slowly, I kept moving forward, every atom of my being the sole focus of that presence I felt watching me.

There was that small, logical voice in my mind. I’m surprised it was still there, thought it had died off long ago, absent as logic was from nearly all my prior decisions. But still, a part of me said there was nothing to fear. It’s just a guy, a normal, mortal man with a weird stare.

Now as I said, I’ve been plenty stupid in the past. I know what it’s like to drive yourself into paranoia. Some part of me wondered, as I staggered down the street, if I was just freaking out, if maybe I’d had something other than beer and shots, if I was high.

But I knew I wasn’t, and I know I was right to be afraid.

I didn’t look up at the second floor window when I approached. I didn’t want him to know I was scared. But I could feel his gaze beating down on like the summer sun, could almost feel it singe my flesh. I shuddered, but then I moved around from that side of the building and his presence left me, towards the worn, steel stairs. Ascending them, caged by solid steel that rang underfoot, I felt safer.

Next came the door. A plain, white door, marked with 3B in plain black. I stood there, the automatic light throwing a sulfurous orange glow about me. And in the middle of the door, beneath the plain, glossy number was the peephole.

I couldn’t tell you how long I stood, poised with the key, looking into the beady little hole. It might have been 2 minutes, might have been 2 hours.

In some way, it was worse than the certainty of knowing he was watching. Maybe he was on the other side, watching my warped form, or maybe he was already asleep.

Standing there, adrenaline leeching from my system, probably still way too drunk, I made the decision, unlocked the door and entered.

The apartment was almost as I’d left it that morning. TV and PS4 were in their place, the fan had been left on, a jumble of wires, chargers, and the router sat on their little end table. Gray couch with miscellaneous stains. Fridge covered in tacky magnets from Jen’s trips and old receipts. Everything was normal.

Except the window.

The window was open; the curtains billowed lethargically in the night’s breeze. I stepped up to it, and putting my hands on the sill, I could look out, and see exactly where I’d rounded the corner and felt his gaze, I could look and see how I would’ve been spotlighted by the streetlamp. I felt my skin crawl, and I turned to look at my roommate’s door.

It was closed, and hopefully locked. The apartment was still. He either wasn’t here anymore, or else was asleep.

The day was starting to catch up with me, and all the tension and adrenaline had been draining since I came in. I felt unsteady as I closed the window, drew the curtains. Staggered through to my room, closed and locked the door as gently as I could, pushing the deadbolt home as quietly as I could manage.

Then I collapsed on the bed.

 

……….

 

The next morning I awoke, sticky, reeking, with a miserable pounding in my head and a mouth that tasted like crap. I’d passed out without turning on my AC, and the hot Texan morning was doing a number on me. I dragged myself from the salt-crusted puddle I’d left, having taken my clothes off some point in the night. A glance at my phone told me it was 11:49 and I had 2% battery left.

Shit, I thought. I put the thing on to charge and crawled through to my bathroom. Luckily both rooms had their own, though I wasn’t thinking about my roommate just then. I quickly showered, rinsing away the grime of the stifling night and pissing while I was in there. A quick brush of the teeth and I felt somewhat more normal.

Clothes on, I closed my hands around my door handle, determined to make some coffee and start my morning, when yesterday hit me. In a flash, the encounter at the Whataburger and him watching me stagger home. In an instant, I felt scared again. Scared and angry. What the hell was I so afraid of? In the cold light of day, with an aggressive hangover and things to do, it seemed silly to be terrified of my own damn roommate.

I unlocked the door with viciousness, and grabbed my keys and wallet.

As I stepped out, I was greeted with blaring laughter from the TV.

Mike was there, facing away, ostensibly watching an old repeat of The Big Bang Theory. His back was straight, unnaturally so. He sat stiff and immobile.

Some character quipped, and the laugh track erupted, but my roommate wasn’t laughing.

He was statue-like, my roommate, unflinching as the laughter went on, sitting still as a taxidermy, not looking back at me.

I could barely bring myself to speak.

“Hey,” I got out.

“Yes.” He said, and for the first time it struck me how flat his voice was. Not even emotionless, but flat. As if someone had taken a recording and screwed with the levels and balancing and left a voice devoid of anything.

My mouth moved and no sound came out. Some big punch line went off on the TV, and the laugh track howled and shrieked, and my roommate didn’t move or make a sound.

“Look.” I got out. “I’m going out for the day.”

The hollow voice came back. “I’ll be here.”

That was what he always said, and for the first time it registered in my brain, not as a friendly affirmative, but as a threat. I all but ran out the apartment.

I was in my shitbox Honda and half way down the street before I realized that I’d forgotten my phone. I was half tempted to turn around, but decided I wouldn’t need it.

As I was driving, I realized I was still really pretty drunk, so I stopped for an early lunch at a Burger King. Nothing good, just a double Whopper with cheese. I felt that a big slab of meat and bread like that, plus a crappy coffee, might help me sober up.

Whether it helped or not I don’t know. I didn’t crash on my way to Jen’s place, at least. Once I’d arrived, it was hard to knock normally rather than bashing the shit out of the door, but I restrained myself.

Now I’m kind of a scrawny guy, tall, but thin, built (as Dick said) like a crackhead. My sister is quite the opposite, short, a bit chunky, and covered in tattoos. I said hey, trying to not look too insane when she opened the door.

“Hey yourself. You could’ve called.” She started.

I smiled and shrugged. “Forgot my phone. Had a crazy morning.”

“Right. You coming in? Sue won’t be home for a few hours anyway.”

I nodded, and followed her in.

It was nice, Jen’s apartment. Far nicer now that I’d moved out. White, modern, minimalist (besides for the amp and cables strewn across the floor), with a big kitchen and a huge TV we’d both pitched in for.

“How’s the spare room coming on?” I asked, trying to seem casual as I poked my head into the room I’d lived in since I was 17. It was bare and empty, all my crappy posters and other crap I’d left long gone. That hurt a little. Like my sister had ripped a part of me out of her life. Not that I could blame her.

“It’s coming. It’ll be cool to have an office.” She said, coming over to peer in besides me.

I nodded. “Yeah. I’m sure.”

Jen is more the creative type than me. Her and Sue wanted a place to work on her music for ages. It’s just a hobby really, but she’s always talking about it, and she always needed a special place to work properly. Back in high school, she never did any homework, until our Dad set up a little study area in a spare room.

“So,” she said, “what’s this visit all about?”

I sighed hard, crossing my arms as I threw myself on her couch. I sat for a moment, biting my lip, as I tried to think of something to say. There weren’t any secrets between us, except maybe one of mine, but it was hard to frame it.

“It’s my roommate.”

“Oh, right. What’s him name again?”

I hesitated. “Mike, I think.”

Jen snorted. “You think? Some roommate you are. Don’t you talk with the guy?”

“No.”

“No?”

I looked at her, feeling embarrassment rising once again. “I’m scared of him.”

Immediately her expression sobered. “Why? He’s not into drugs is he?”

“No!” I started. “No, it’s not drugs. He’s… There’s something real off about him.”

“Off how?” Jen pressed. “Something we should tell the police?”

I shook my head. “There’s nothing to tell them. His behavior is just, strange as hell.”

 “Was he jacking off in the living room?”

“No!” I took a breath. “Look, I never speak to the guy. Don’t even notice him. But the other day, he came into work, and he stared at me.”

Jen looked unsure. “Well, yeah, you live together.”

“Not like that. He’s scary, Jen, terrifying. He came in and stared at me, like he could see into my soul.”

I watched her face fall at my words; I saw the pity in her eyes, that sudden hard edge of accusation.

“Are you on anything?” She asked.

My sister, my rock, and the one person I could trust. She thought I was having a relapse. It broke my heart.

People do stupid things. It started in high school. My girlfriend at the time, she got into it through her older brother’s friends, and I wanted her to think I was cool. Stupid shit, I won’t go into it here. I’ve been clean for 5 years, now, all thanks to Jen. But her reaction made it all come back.

I talked longer, I explained as well as I could, told her about last night, about this morning. Finally, she was coming around.

“-and he wasn’t laughing? He was just sitting there?” She asked.

“Yeah.”

“Well, it was the Big Bang Theory; I don’t know anyone who laughs at that.”

I kept my frustration buried. “Yeah, but he was completely emotionless, not moving, not blinking.”

“Okay, I can see why you’re freaking out a bit.” She said.

“Thank you,” I said sardonically, “but what the hell should I do?”

She leaned back into the couch, looking sidelong at me. “I guess I’ll have to mediate.”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean I’ll talk to him. Figure out if he’s got something against you, or why he’s being so weird.” She explained.

“Okay, Jen. Thanks. I’m glad you believe me.” It was a weight off my chest, having my sister back on my side. She always was, even when my own parents threw me out. She’d done a lot for me, and here she was coming to my rescue again.

It’s isolating, going through things alone. Just having a single person to share these things with brought a sense of peace and security I’d been missing for a day.

We’d been talking for nearly an hour at this point, and Jen agreed to come back with me, talk to my creepy-ass roommate, and help me sort all this shit out. I was standing, grabbing my keys off the kitchen counter, when I looked out the window.

“What the fuck?” It slipped out of me, along with every shred of hope I’d gained since I left that morning.

“What?” said Jen, peeking round my elbow.

He was there. Other side of the road. Standing, watching.

Jen tensed as she saw him.

“He isn’t moving.” She said, an edge creeping into her voice.

“Nope.”

“Okay, wait here. I guess this makes it easier.” Jen said as she slunk into her room, coming back out with her purse.

“Makes what easier?” I asked, as she began digging through all the receipts and crap in her bag.

“Not laughing at shit sitcoms I get, but no one stalks my little brother.” She emerged from her bag with a spray bottle.

I blinked, “What’s that?”

She rolled her eyes at me. “Deodorant, dipshit.” She only called me that when she was super pissed. “What do you think? It’s fucking mace. You’re right, this guy’s a fucking creep, following you out here, and now he knows where I live too.”

She gave me a look as she strode to the door.

“I’m sorry I ever doubted you, bro.” She said.

In that instant, a flicker of my old hope returned. At least I could always count on my sister.

She stormed out the door in a fury; pepper spray in hand, shoulders set. She might be short, but she could be terrifying in her own way at times. My roommate, however, didn’t move. He just stood, rooted to the sidewalk, in front of the apartment block opposite, and he was still staring at me, not noticing 4’11” of protective older sibling marching towards him.

She was right on him when he turned.

It was slow, she was shouting, bringing up the spray can, when Mike began to speak. He turned and looked at Jen, and her shoulders fell.

I couldn’t hear them, not from in there. I had no idea what they were saying.

But Jen seemed to fall inwards on herself. Together, she and my roommate turned, facing me. Mike kept speaking, and Jen looked down at her feet. He put a hand on her shoulder, almost reassuring.

She dropped the can, and my gut dropped with it.

I have no idea what happened, what he said. But next thing I knew Jen was coming back over, mace picked back up. At the door she stopped, and I saw the tears on her cheeks. Her voice wobbled.

“Get out.”

I couldn’t understand. “What? What’s wrong with him, is he gonna le-“

Jen pointed the pepper spray in my face.

“Get the fuck out. Never talk to me again, or I’ll call the fucking police.”

My mind raced and I felt sick, as she slammed the door on me. With nothing else to do I looked about the street, but my roommate was gone. I was shaking, probably in shock as I walked by to my car. I was breathing hard.

I didn’t even know I was driving until I pulled into my parking spot, just as the sun was going down in a big splash of orange.

What the hell did he tell Jen? What could he have told her? And why the fuck would Jen believe my weird roommate? I couldn’t make sense of any it, I shut my eyes and pounded on my dashboard, probably making the cracks in it worse, but I didn’t care.

I tried to tell myself that it was an act; that Jen was doing something to get rid of Mike. I just needed to trust her. But part of me knew. There are mistakes I’ve made, ones I’ve only told Jen about, sure. And also one I’ve never told anyone. If my roommate somehow knew it, if that’s what he told Jen. I could see that leading to her reaction.

But I couldn’t see how he could know, or why she’d ever believe him.

I looked up at my apartment. He might already be back. Probably was. But I needed my phone at least. I figured that I might as well take all my crap, leave town for a few days, until this is sorted. I think I could sort shit out with Dick, not lose my job. Besides, I was gonna have to deal with Mike.

I came up. He was here. Standing in the kitchen, with his back to me. It was like being in a room with a temperamental nuclear bomb, I felt so tense. I don’t know if I was trying to sneak, that’d be pathetic, but I kept my breathing shallow, and stepped as lightly as I could across to my room.

If anything, I think he kept turning, kept his back to me.

As soon as my door was locked, I grabbed my gym bag, and stuffed it full of every clean piece of clothing I could find. Then went toothpaste, toothbrush, deodorant.

Then came a knock on my door.

I froze, heart smacking my ribs.

Then came his voice, still and terrible.

“You want to leave.”

It wasn’t a question.

“That wouldn’t be a very smart choice.” It continued.

I wasn’t sure what I could have done, no words came to mind, everything was blank. There was nothing I could do but listen to that still, dispassionate, almost artificial voice.

“You should have been honest with Jen, years ago.”

I clenched my fists, my teeth, my whole body tightened, against my will.

“It weighs heavily.” The voice stated. “So very heavy.”

I felt hot, flushed, every muscle tensed as I sat and listened.

“It’s important to talk.”

There was nothing I wanted more than to be somewhere else, anywhere. I almost considered diving through the window.

“It would be best if you confessed.”

I shut my eyes, willing my roommate to leave, to give me a chance to get to my car.

“Then, I will go now. I have some things to see to. But I am very willing to listen when you return.”

The outer door slammed, suddenly. I jumped, almost cried out, as all that tension suddenly bled away. I have no idea what the fuck he was talking about. He’s been gone a while now, and I’ve finished packing my stuff. I’m going to leave now, get as far as I can tonight, then I’ll give Dick a call, sort out work. Looks like Jen’s blocked me on everything. I guess I might have to go talk to my parents.
