This happened a few weeks ago, now that I'm fully sitting down to write it all out. 

As of writing this I've turned 18. Happy Birthday to me. 
I really don't know where to begin. 

I guess at the start.

I used to live somewhere in Maine, with my parents. But they weren't the best, and I couldn’t live there anymore. It wasn't living at that point, it was surviving.

So one afternoon when my mom passed out, needle in her arm, I stole her keys, packed my things, then stole her car. 

I only had 36$ that I had taken with the keys. But I didn’t care, I wanted to leave. 

After a few hours, I needed gas, and so I stopped at a gas station next to a truck stop. I was hungry, so I bought snacks, peanut butter m&ms and I forgot what else, then I filled my car up. 

I sat and ate the other stuff I bought, still can't remember, when I saw how dirty this trucker’s truck was. It gave me an idea.

I walked over to the trucker and told him I was needing gas money, that I had lost my wallet going home. Then offered to clean his truck for 30$. Thankfully he agreed. Saying “Good looking out boy, I was planning on a tryna hook a few lizards tonight. Hell if you get it good I may give you a nice tip.” I wasn't sure what he meant, but I quickly followed him to his truck. He said something else, then patted my back. I got to cleaning. 

It wasn't that nasty, or dirty. Just a lot of empty containers. It took 30 minutes, and he was gone for an hour. But when he came back, he was excited about how clean it was. “Damn boy, I haven't seen it this clean in years. You know what. Take it all.” The trucker said to me, then handed me 2 100$ bills out of a stack as thick as my arm.

I went to my car happy, and decided I wouldn't stop again until I needed gas. To save the money.

The trip was decent, but boring. It all looked the same, until I hit West Virginia. 

I decided to take a more scenic route through the mountains that my GPS offered. 

There had also been a sign for gas, and food. So I took the exit. 

After 15 minutes down a road full of curves and surrounded by thick forest I had made it to what once could have been called a town. 

It had a gas station that had pumps that were out of order, and 3 busted up buildings with more busted houses deeper into town.

I needed gas, so I stopped, not knowing the pumps don't work, I pulled into the gas station and parked right outside of the doors. 

As I went into the store, I could feel the cashier staring at me. I thought nothing of it, I have Maine tags in West Virginia. 

When I entered I went straight to the counter. Then asked for 40$ on whichever pump worked. “Ain't any of them work.” The Cashier said, with a thick southern drawl. “Where is the next gas station that has gas?” I asked, kind of frustrated. “Well, if you take a right when you leave here, then go on down the road for 10 minutes, take a left, then continue for another 20 minutes you'll be in the town next over.” The Cashier explained, chewing tobacco. “Alright, sounds good.” I said, hoping I'd have enough gas to get there. “You better get goin’, it ain't safe out here at dark for tourists.” The cashier said, kind of harshly. Now I know he was just trying to scare me back towards the highway. “Why is that?” I asked, smugly. “These animals out here ain't like what you have up north. Nothing like it. Just take my advice. Maybe go back the way you came, bud.” The Cashier said, spitting tobacco after his sentence. “I think I will be fine, thanks anyways.” I said, leaving the store. I wish I would have listened.

I took his directions, unknowingly I took the wrong left, and that turn took me on what seemed like an endless road, covered in forest. After 20 minutes of driving I took out my paper map, but according to the map I wasn’t on a road, I was in the middle of nowhere. Same with my car's GPS device.

After another 20 minutes I was almost out of gas, and decided to turn around. Hoping I'd have enough to get back to the run down gas station.

10 minutes after I turned around, I was out of gas, and stuck on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere. I either walked back, or waited for someone to drive by. It was also starting to get dark, and I had no flashlight. So I decided to stay in the car, and hope someone drives by.

Once it got dark, I turned the car on to listen to music. Not like the battery dying would make my situation worse. 

After 30 minutes since the sun set, I started to hear things. Nothing that would cause too much panic if I was in a different situation. 

There was a distant howl, from something I have never heard before or since. Leaves and sticks falling from the trees above onto my car, Like something was jumping from branch to branch.

After an hour the howls had stopped, but heavy footsteps off and on from the edge of the woods kept me from dozing off. I assumed it was a bear, or a curious deer. Regardless, I wasn't checking.

Once the noises stopped being as frequent I couldn't keep my eyes open. I started to doze off. 

I fell asleep for what felt like 30 seconds when I heard the scrape of nails against my car window. Jolting awake, to see 3 long scratches next to where my head was. 

I jumped into the passenger seat, and screamed. Like a bitch, I'll admit it. But I thought it was a bear, but I was wrong. So wrong. After a minute of silence, I heard heavy breathing behind me, and whipped around to see some creature drooling, and breathing at the window where my head was again. 

It was not a bear, I am not sure what it was. I can describe it. It looked like a giant squirrel, which now might make this story less believable. But I wish I was lying. 

The head was covered in blood, dried and fresh. Teeth yellow, and rotting. Eyes blacker than anything I have ever seen. 

I screamed again, of course, and jumped into the back seat, looking for anything I could use as a weapon. 

I eventually found an umbrella. But before I could even think what I could use it for, glass shattered and the creature was in the car.

I opened the door, and jumped out of the car, running into the road. The creature was digging through my car, looking for something.

After a minute it had found it, my peanut butter M&ms. 

It ate the package whole, then coughed and choked a little. 

I was frozen, what could I do? It had my car, and I was in his territory. 

But by some sick luck, headlights began to shine from afar, and the creature retreated into the woods. 

The Cashier from the gas station pulled up, yelling for me but I was still frozen. 

“Get the fuck in the car, that thing wont stop til the morning. You can stay with me.” The cashier said, ushering me into his car. 

After a second I came back, and hurried into his car. 

He started to speak again, But I was still dazed. 

Before he could take the car out of park, his window busted, and he was ripped from the car. All I could hear was his body being violently ripped to pieces, then I jumped in the driver's seat, and began to drive.

I felt a bump as I drove away, knowing for sure it was that cashier. With no time to be upset, I started to drive as fast as I could. While stupidly staring in the mirror to see if the creature was following.

It was faster than I predicted, then I crashed into a ditch because I was more focused on what was behind me than in front of me.

I tried to move the car, hoping it wasn't too deep. But I had no luck, and then I heard a thud on the roof above me.

I quickly scanned the car, for anything to protect myself. When I opened the glove box, a hand gun fell out. I grabbed it and checked to see if it was loaded. It was. So I fired 2 shots into the roof.

As soon as the second bullet pierced the roof, the creature let out a horrible scream, the only thing I can think of that is close to the sound it made is an Aztec death whistle.

After the scream, it was silent. The sun was just starting to peek over the trees, and I decided it was now or never. 

I quickly scanned the trees, seeing movement far ahead of me. I decided to go for it. I let off 3 more shots in the direction of the creature. Another scream, then a loud thud, like it had fallen from the trees. I quickly checked the trunk of the cashier's car, hoping maybe for gas, or food. 

I found gas, a full 5 gallon tank. I quickly made my way back to my car, filled it up, and jumped into the driver's seat. Then drove away.

It has been 3 weeks since this happened, I haven't seen anything on the news regarding the cashier, or a giant squirrel creature being found dead.

I made my way to Illinois, far from any mountains. Just how I want it to be until I die. 

If anyone has any explanation on what attacked me, please let me know. I can't find anything online. Maybe it's a were-squirrel.
