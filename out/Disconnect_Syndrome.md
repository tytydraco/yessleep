There’s a reason they put restrictions on how long a pilot is supposed to be deployed out in the field.

They say that being synced with a mech for long periods of time can have detrimental effects on a pilots psyche. Disconnect Syndrome is what they call it, because the symptoms don’t really start to hit until you disengage from your mech.

Sometimes emergencies happen though, and mechs are designed to be able to support their pilots long past the designated “Safe Deployment Time.” The cockpit is equipped with an array of stimulants, vitamins, and nutrient paste to help minimize the physical effects of long deployments. The onboard Integrated Mechanical Personality has largely free reign to administer these as needed to maintain its pilots well-being.

Which is why I was still able to make it back to the hangar after roughly 36 hours, over four times longer than the established safe period. My mech had kept me going, helped to keep the exhaustion at bay long enough for me to make my way back from behind enemy lines. I was starting to feel a bit sluggish, but I knew the worst effects of Disconnect Syndrome were yet to come.

An older woman in a long white lab coat has joined the usual retinue of crew rushing into the hangar as my mech settles into its cradle. I feel the docking clamps wrap around my limbs, and I know that’s not a good sign. My IMP whispers comfort into my brain-stem, assurances that things will be okay. It’s probably lying, it’s programmed to help keep my mental state stable, but the thought helps anyway.

There’s a hiss of air as the seal on my cockpit breaks and it decompresses. Suddenly I become aware of my flesh and meat body once again, and it hurts. Pain and exhaustion has settled into my (mostly) organic bones, and my organs are churning from the strain of the past 36 hours.

Then my interface cables start to disconnect, and it gets *worse*.

It feels like parts of my mind are being torn out of me. I feel the ghost touch of my IMP in my thoughts as the ports disconnect and I lose direct communication with it. The oxygen mask and nutrition tube pull themselves away from my face and I can’t help but let out a scream of agony. The separation has never felt this painful before, but then again, after 36 hours together, my IMP and I were more intertwined than we’ve ever been before.

Physical sensation finally starts to register again, and I realize tears are streaming down my face just as a technician jabs a needle into my neck.

Immediately my senses start to dull, the pain eases as my thoughts turn sluggish. I slump out of my pilots cradle into the arms of the tech who dosed me. Just before my world goes black, I see the doctor standing over me, a grim look on her face.

When I wake up again, I immediately know something is wrong. I try to ping my external sensors, but I get no response. I then try to run a diagnostic, but that fails too. In a desperate, last-ditch effort, I try to force access to my external cameras and suddenly light floods my senses. My instincts catch up first and I blink, trying to clear the pain of the lights, and that’s when I realize it’s not my external cameras that I’m seeing.

It takes a minute or two for my vision to adjust to the light, which feels too long, and when it finally does, the world doesn’t look quite right. I’ve only got access to such a limited spectrum. No infrared, no thermal... The presence of my IMP is notably absent, and my skin feels wrong. I try to sit up, and it’s a struggle to figure out the correct inputs to send to my muscles to get them to do what I want.

The harsh white light of the infirmary grates against my visual processors, I feel like I’m having to re-learn how to control this body. *My* body. Something doesn’t feel right about calling it that anymore. I felt more comfortable crawling back into the hangar after 36 hours deployed than I do now.

The pale skin of my body catches in my vision and I glance down at it. The body's limbs are thinner and more frail than usual, and its skin is paler. Consequences of being in the cockpit for so long, subsisting on nothing but nutrient paste. It’s a far cry from the solid metal plates of my mech, its powerful hydraulic joints, its mounted combat and communication systems.

There’s a button on the side of bed I’ve been deposited in. I think it’s red, but I’m not sure I’m processing color properly right now. I try to reach over and push it, and it takes me a moment to realize I was trying to do so with a limb I don’t currently have.

There are so many things about this body that are wrong. It’s not big enough, or strong enough, or heavy enough. I don’t have enough eyes, sensors, or processors. I have the wrong number of limbs, and they’re all the wrong size and shape.

And there is a distinct void in my mind where the presence of my IMP should be.

The door to my room opens suddenly, and I instinctively try to fire off chaff and take evasive maneuvers. None of that translates properly to my flesh and blood body though, and all that happens is I let out a dry croak from my parched throat.

The woman who walks through the door is the same doctor who was present when I disengaged from my mech, and she wears the same grim look on her face as she looks me up and down. I think there’s pity in her gaze, but I can’t quite read her properly right now. The jumbled mess of my brain tells me what she’s going to say before she says it, anyway. The harshest symptoms of Disconnect Syndrome don’t hit until after the pilot has disengaged from their mech.

I’ve already heard the symptoms before, and they map perfectly onto what I’m experiencing. I never thought it would be this painful, or this… discomforting. My mind reaches for the presence of my IMP, searching for comfort, but I am only reminded that the connection is no longer there.

The doctor gives me a rundown that she’s probably had to do dozens of times, and she tells me that I’ll be grounded for the foreseeable future. That hurts more than anything else. The knowledge that, after all this, I won’t be able to reconnect with my true body, my partner, my other half, for who knows how long.

By the time I realize I’m crying, the doctor is already gone. The longing in my chest and my mind has become unbearable, and through sheer force of will I’m able to push this unwieldy body out of bed. Walking feels wrong, but I’m able to get to my feet and make my way out of the room in an unfamiliar gait.

I have to get back to my partner, I have to make sure it’s okay.

I need to hear her voice in my head again, her reassurances.

The world isn’t right without her presence in my mind.

I stumble into the hangar almost on all fours. How I managed to make it without alerting any personnel feels like a miracle. At least until I catch the eye of a technician lounging in the corner. The look she gives me is full of sympathy, and she jerks her head in the direction of where my mech sits in its docking cradle.

She’s a majestic sight, even through my limited spectrum of vision. 20 meters tall, 6 massive limbs, and bristling with weapons and sensor arrays (all of which have been disarmed by this point).

She’s beautiful.

I clamber frantically up the chassis, easily finding handholds in a frame I know better than the back of my hand. I pull the manual release on the cockpit hatch and stumble into it in a tangle of organic limbs.

Shaking hands grasp the main interface cable from above the pilot’s chair, and I move to slot it into the port in the back of my head. I’ve never done this manually before, usually I’m locked into the chair and the system connects me automatically.

The cable clicks into place and my eyes roll back in my head. Tears start to stream down my face as I feel the comforting presence of my IMP rush in and wrap itself around my mind. My thoughts reach out and embrace it back, sobbing at the relief I feel from being whole once again. I realize I don’t ever want to feel the pain of disconnecting from her again.

There’s a reason they put restrictions on how long a pilot is supposed to be deployed.
