The thing keeps getting louder.

I keep hearing weird noises and i don't know what to do. For context, i live in a victorian house in the middle of nowhere. My only neighbours are always on vacation so its always very quiet where i live. Well, as i said i keep hearing something in the middle of the nigth. Its always at 2:07am


Well, one day i was just tidying up the house when i heard it for the first time. It was a low growl, almost like a dog. At first, i ignored it and continued to clean the house but then something fell on the floor. It made a shattering noise, so i assumed it was a vase or something like that. I ignored it once more and continued to do whatever i was doing. I didn't hear anymore noises that evening. 

Later, in that dawn, i heard it again. This time it was louder. It was growling again but it looked much angrier this time. I was getting a headache so i decided to get up. My head was throbing from the lack of sleep so i wasnt able to fall asleep again. After i got up, i walked downstairs but i couldnt ser anything due to the darkness. I checked the clock. Exactly 2:07am. This was weird a fuck. I gave up from searching what was making the noises and i made my way back to my room. I shouldnt be up this late anyways, especially because i had work in the morning. Eventually, i fell asleep. 

I woke up in the next morning to my alarm. I clicked on "snooze". My head was still throbing from last nigth's "encounter". If i can even call it an encounter. I got dressed and went downstairs to have breakfast. Then i left for work. I was feeling sick and i definitely needed to get some more rest. 
That day was tiring and i hated every single part of it. When i got home i was exhausted and just wanted to get some rest. But of course i wasnt getting any peace. The minute i stepped in the house i felt something was off. It was too silent. I walked around for a bit to see what could be wrong. Everything looked normal. Thats when i heard it. The breathing in the back of my head. Fuck. It was rigth behind me. I froze and couldnt do anything. It grabbed me. I finally decided to do something, so i ran. I ran until i couldnt breathe anymore, i ran until i exhausted, i ran until i colapsed on the floor. I didn't stop running until i was sure i was safe from that damn thing. But i could hear it rigth behind me, growling and running in all fours. I turned my head to look at it, and what i saw was horrifying. It didn't have a head but it knew where i was going. It had giantic members that looked like spaghetti and it was covered in blood. My blood. It had bit me, how come i hadn't noticed? Thats when i felt the searing pain. Now that the shock phase was gone i could feel my arm aching. I stumbled on a rock and fell. The thing was getting faster and faster and i was starting to panick. I tried to crawl my way out of there but my effort was in vain. It was already in front of me. I heard it growling.. before it consumed me.
