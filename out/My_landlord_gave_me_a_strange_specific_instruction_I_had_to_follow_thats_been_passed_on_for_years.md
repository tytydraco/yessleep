I used to live in a crappy apartment in New York. I was desperate to move to a better home, and I found one all the way in North Carolina. It was near a decent paying job so I ended making a hard decision and moving states permanently, until I get enough money to be financially stable in New York.

The home was nice, big and very clean, and the landlord was renting it to me for cheap, I mean cheaper than it look anyway. We made the deal quick when I saw it, but I was in more awe in person. 

However, I found something strange in the home. There was multiple sound playing devices. There was Alexa’s and speakers in every room, there was TV’s in every room, there was even a small TV in the 2 bathrooms. This was incredibly odd, I questioned him but he didn’t give an answer and instead continued talking about the positives reviews.

However, right when I was about to make myself comfortable in my new home and unpack and do all the necessary things I needed to do, the landlord finally answers the question. “All, well, most the electronics were left here by previous renters of the house for it to keep as a gift to the next renter”. He emphasized the “gift” hardly. 

I nodded and stated my farewells before he tells me to come back to discuss an important matter involving the house. “I almost forgot something. Never let the house go silent for long enough. Once you hear silence, to the point where either nothing is bearable or you start to hear ringing from your ears, you must do everything to break it”.

I had a long of questions. As I was about to state my first one, he continued his rule set, almost as if he was making sure I understood and had to understand everything he said and everything he will say. 
“If the house goes silent for 3 seconds, it’s not a big deal. 5 second is not that much of a biggie either. 7 is where you should be cautious. 10 is where you must break it, there’s a chance it will start to reek or noises will be heard.If  it reaches 15, make the opposite of silence. Make the whole thing loud to overcome the noises and hope it gets scared off. It lurks on the silence. If it goes anything higher than 17, give me a call and try to survive until  I appear. This should be everything you need to know. Have fun on the house and call if you have questions”.

Call if you have questions? Brother, I have a whole multiverse of questions flooding in my mind I wanted to ask you in that moment. He had  walked long gone before I could level ask one of the millions of questions flowing inside my mind, and plus I was tired, so I went in and made my way to the master  to sleep  on the unfinished bed. Until I realized, it’s silent. 

I turn on my phone to a podcast I didn’t finish watching. It had been only 6 seconds so I was in the clear according to his rules and the consequences. I immediately got on the bed and turned the tv on. While I charge my phone, letting the podcast on as-well.

I fell asleep rather quickly. I woke up with the tv morning channel  and some random videos playing on my phone since my podcast ended while I was sleeping. When I checked my phone, I had an unread text from my landlord. “If you read this, then you made night, congrats. At least you’re not a 2.0 of Jacob”.

The heck? Why am I getting congratulated for surviving at a house? Do people usually die after renting out this house? And who is Jacob? I didn’t let it bother me, as I had more important stuff ahead of me like work and fully unpacking everything. Turns out my new job wasn’t bad at all, in fact it’s better than my job in New York, and unpacking was easy since I had nothing to do. 

The following day, I mowed the already short lawn out of boredom, before going to my room for a deep slumber. I reach for the remote that’s on the pillow next to me as I lay down to turn off the television to get as much good sleep as I can. I then close my eyes and made myself comfortable with the blankets and rearranged my pillows before a loud crash coming from the garage can be heard. 

My stomach feels like I been stabbed, and I start to feel lighted as my heart races by the second. I then decide to stop hiding underneath my bed sheets and quietly crawl out the bed before I  yell “Who’s there” before grabbing a wooden bat that was for some reason in the room’s closet. I turn the tv on and put the volume not low but not that high either, just enough for it to be heard downstairs, so  the house could not go completely quiet, so whoever is intruding my house doesn’t hear me. 

My stomach roared  from fear as I approach the door leading to the garage. Each second my heart beats louder as I clench onto baseball harder, preparing myself to absolutely wreck whoever is lurking in my garage. When I opened the door leading to the garage, a couple of random junk from shelf’s fell and noises similar to boxes being kicked ringed my ears , like if someone heard I was coming and decided to run, except, there was no where to run.

The door where you click a button to open to drive your car into the garage was never open nor opened, and I was blocking the manual door. It’s as if something was here, and vanished into thin air when it sensed my presence.  I immediately ran to my room, locked the door, and hid beneath the sheets. After 5 minutes or so of calming myself down, I text the landlord and told him to explain what the heck just happened.

“Hey man, I was sleeping and all of a sudden a loud noise coming from the garage. When I went to check, no one was there, and there no was no where to run since all ways to leave the garage were blocked. I’m shivering right now, I’m hiding under my sheets in fear”. He responds not even a minute later. “Are you joking? Was there silence at all in the house and for how long?”

“Why would I joke around, and there was silence, I needed to sleep man. I don’t know for long exactly, but my estimation is 10 or so seconds before I heard the noise from the garage I guess.” 
He responded immediately and with a lengthy paragraph, he was mad, like if I messed things up and converted things into an urgent matter. 
“Are you kidding me? I told you multiple times not to let off a quiet atmosphere in the house ever! Why aren’t you listening to me? Do you not value your own life? Don’t ever make the house silent, even if you’re not there. Is there any smells or noises?”. 

 “There no noises or smells, and as for the silence, I’ll always keep 1 or 2 TV’s on.”

“Good. Text me if you need anything else”.

15-20 minutes after I hid in my room in fear of the demon or whatever that was, I finally got the courage to step outside my room. It was cold, and apart from my room, silence fought the turned-on television in my room. 

I grabbed the bat and went downstairs to get the bat, and connected the speaker to the downstairs TV and started I playing random NFL highlights on it to make noise downstairs. It was weird having to live in a house where it constantly HAS to be loud, but I got accustomed to it after bit.

3 weeks passes after that encounter with some unknown noise maker in the garage, and everything seemed to go well in the house, until I got a loud buzzing from my phone that made me jump and spill my water. It was an alert for an upcoming storm that might cause a flash flood.

The landlord texted me unexpectedly. “Hey have you heard about the incoming storm”. I ignored him for half an hour before I replied to him.
“Yeah, might bring a flood, but who knows?”
He was typing  within 10 seconds, this must have been an important matter.

“Yes, and storms/floods like these always bring problems relating to internet connections or power outages 9 times out of 10. In case of the lights going out or the internet and your plan failing to work, use or buy a streaming service that allows you download videos and watch them even if internet disabled. Make sure you put it at full volume if it’s on your phone, and if it is , I recommend walking around the house every 30 minutes with the phone playing whatever you desire at full volume on your phone. If the television can still turn on and manages to go on some apps, then make sure you logged and go on to the streaming service that has downloadable videos or music on 2-3 televisions and turn the volume up to half or more. Do these specific instructions during the storm, just incase if the power goes out”.

“Alright”. He didn’t bother to even check the message, he said what he needed to say and got back to whatever he was doing.
On the television of my room and downstairs, I logged on to a streaming service that can download videos and you can watch them whenever, they were offering a free trial, I wouldn’t have bought it if it wasn’t offering it. I ended up putting a video combining 2 podcasts to make sure that it goes as long or longer than the storm. 

1 hour later, it feels like I’m in the middle of the worst hurricane. Trees look like they were about fall down, the heavy rain fail sounds like meteors hitting the ground, and like my landlord predicted, there was no internet.
I put the television in my room to 45% volume and 85 % for the one the living room. My house sounds like a food court, the opposite of a library. Somehow, I manage to fall asleep during  the rain and the televisions. 

But I’m awoken by a sound louder than both the rain and the TV’s combined. It sounded like a shotgun being fired right next to my ear. I jump out from my bed, I grab my bat and go to the corner of my room. As I wasn’t scared enough, I then hear what sounds to be a short thing walking through the house. 

It wasn’t like a monster lurking through the house or a murderer sneaking, it was like a gnome taking a stroll. Go to a carpet and tiptoe the quietest you can yet make it bearable aswell, that’s what it sounded like. I checked the time and it has been 9 hours, and the storm still kept going. 
However, I haven’t ever been so scared until I realized that I can’t hear the televisions. It has been silent and I don’t even know how long. I had no other videos downloaded and I had no internet. I almost vomit. My life flashed before my eyes without even seeing anything that had the risk of killing me.

I texted my landlord a total of 34 times. Each message saying something among the lines of “HELP ME. ITS SILENT AND I DONT KNOW HOW LONG ITS BEEN SILENCE, BUT NOW IM HEARING LOUD NOISES AND TIPTOES”
My landlord responded instantly, I don’t even know how, he probably had the message already typed out expecting a problem like this to occur. “Why why why? Why do you never follow my instructions? WHY? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? SAFELY UNLOCK THE FRONT DOOR. DO NOT LEAVE. ILL BE THERE IN 5. GET EVERYTHING YOU THINK CAN PROTECT YOU.”
Out of adrenaline, I fought the ongoing  fear and sprinted to the door, unlocked it, and sprinted back in a flash. However, that boost of adrenaline must of taken a tole, because my legs were sore and now I’m more scared than ever. After 30 seconds the door open. HES HERE!

“WHERE ARE YOU, KENNETH?” Said my landlord. “UPSTAIRS” I said with all my might. I hear the slide of a shotgun, before rapid footsteps. In walks my landlord into my room, he’s soaked wearing a yellow rubber jacket, and grey pants with rubber boots. He’s holding an umbrella in his left  hand which is covering his head, and the shotgun hugging his chest and embraced with his right hand. 

5 minutes after discussing what’s happening, a sound can be heard from the bathroom. My landlord goes to investigate. 2 shots can be heard. 2 minutes later  someone walks to the door. I was going to tell him what took so long, when I’m stuck by fear, shock, and disgust. It was a creature, but not like a furry demon, it was like a shadow with white veins or streams flowing around him, he has a smile that I don’t think he does voluntarily, and he has wide eyes. He’s stares into my soul as my landlord crawls next to him, holding his arm. It was bloody, but the more I looked into it, it looked like it was about to fall out, like if I punched it, it would just get chopped off. His shotgun was gone. 

The monster then silently walks to me, before the television turns on. The internet was back. A video from my recommendations plays and the monsters starts to reek and make sensitive noises, he later leaves and disappears. We call the police. After them not believing us and them trying to convince us, they just let us go after we got our wounds healed in the hospital.

I am moved to a different home, and the landlord continues to rent the house. Me and him still get in touch. The new home has no problems, it’s basically the same. Same price, similar size and shape.

I had a guest over yesterday at my new home. I went upstairs to bring something she requested for until she came up. I was expecting her to joke about me taking too long until she told me something that struck me to the core.
“There was a noise in your garage, when I went to check, there was nothing there. Is this a prank or what?”
It came back for me. He did a number on my past landlord with his arm , but he never did nothing to me, and it returned to give me a haunting experience once again.
