When Sarah suggested we spend the weekend at her family’s old cabin, it sounded like the perfect escape. I needed a break, and so did our little group. The stress of college, relationships, and everything else weighed on us, and Sarah swore the cabin was “rustic but cozy.” She didn’t mention how deep into the woods it was or how long it had been abandoned.
By the time we arrived, it was already dark. The drive had taken hours, the narrow dirt roads winding endlessly through thick trees. When we pulled up, the cabin looked like something out of a forgotten era—weathered wood, a sagging roof, and windows clouded with grime.

“It’s not much, but it’s ours for the weekend,” Sarah said with an apologetic smile.

Her boyfriend, Eric, chuckled. “Rustic, huh? I’d say borderline condemned.”

“Shut up,” Sarah said, playfully shoving him. “It’s better on the inside.”

It wasn’t.

The cabin smelled like mildew and old wood. The furniture was draped in dusty sheets, and the fireplace was clogged with what looked like years of soot. But it had electricity, a working fridge, and running water—barely—so we made the best of it.

There were five of us: Sarah, Eric, me, my roommate Jenn, and her boyfriend, Nate. We were close, but the kind of close where everyone has their secrets.

The first night started innocently enough. We unpacked, cooked a simple dinner, and played cards by the fireplace. But as the night wore on, an uneasy feeling crept over me. The cabin was too quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you notice every creak, every rustle of the trees outside.

Around midnight, Jenn noticed it first.

“Do you hear that?” she asked, her voice low.

We all froze, straining to listen. At first, there was nothing. Then, faintly, we heard it: a low, rhythmic tapping.

“It’s probably a tree branch,” Eric said, though he didn’t sound convinced.

But when Sarah opened the door to check, there was no wind, no branches near the cabin, and the tapping stopped.

The next morning, I woke to find Sarah sitting on the porch, her arms wrapped around her knees.

“Couldn’t sleep?” I asked, rubbing the fog of sleep from my eyes.

She didn’t look at me, just nodded. “I kept hearing something. Like whispering. It’s probably just the wind.”

I didn’t want to admit it, but I’d heard it too.

That day, we explored the woods around the cabin, trying to shake off the weird vibe. The forest felt… wrong. The trees were too tall, their branches twisting unnaturally high above us. The ground was soft and spongy, like it had rained recently, though it hadn’t.

At some point, Nate found an old trail that led deeper into the woods. Against our better judgment, we followed it.

It ended in a clearing.

At the center stood a circle of stones, arranged in a perfect ring. They were ancient, their surfaces etched with symbols none of us could recognize.

“What is this?” Jenn whispered, stepping closer.

“Probably some old campsite or ritual thing,” Eric said, laughing nervously. “Creepy, but cool.”

But Sarah looked pale. “We should go,” she said quickly, grabbing Eric’s arm.

“Come on, it’s just—”

“We need to go,” she snapped, her voice trembling.

That night, the tapping returned, louder this time. It seemed to move, starting at the front of the cabin and circling around it.

We locked the doors and tried to ignore it, but none of us slept.

At some point, Sarah broke down. “We shouldn’t have gone into the woods,” she whispered. “There’s something out there. Something my grandmother used to talk about.”

“What are you talking about?” Eric asked, his voice tight.

“The Hollow Ones,” she said. “She used to tell me stories about them. They live in the woods, and they hate being disturbed. If you see them…” She trailed off, her eyes wide and unfocused.

“If we see them, what?” Nate pressed, his voice shaking.

Sarah swallowed hard. “It’s already too late.”

By the next day, Nate was gone.

We searched the cabin, the surrounding woods, even the clearing, but there was no sign of him. His shoes were still by the door, his phone on the kitchen counter. It was as if he’d vanished.

Jenn was inconsolable, clinging to me as we huddled in the living room that night. The tapping had grown constant now, louder and more insistent.

“We have to leave,” I said, but Sarah shook her head.

“They won’t let us.”

“Who?” Jenn sobbed.

Before Sarah could answer, the tapping stopped.

And then, the door creaked open.

The thing that stepped inside wasn’t Nate.

It looked like him, but its face was wrong—too smooth, too blank, like someone had sculpted him from clay and forgotten the details. His mouth was just a faint line, his eyes empty hollows.

Jenn screamed, and the thing tilted its head, as if curious.

“They’re here,” Sarah whispered, her voice trembling. “Don’t look at them. Don’t speak to them.”

But it was too late.

Jenn broke free from my grip, running toward the thing that wore Nate’s face. It reached out, and the moment she touched it, she was gone.

No scream, no sound. Just gone.

The last thing I remember is the cabin filling with them. Silent figures with blank faces and hollow eyes. They moved slowly, circling us, their heads tilting in unison as they watched.

Sarah was the first to run. She bolted for the back door, Eric close behind her.

I don’t know if they made it.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t. The last thing I saw before everything went black was a hand reaching for me, pale and impossibly smooth.


When I woke up, I was alone in the clearing.

The sunlight filtered weakly through the trees, but it didn’t bring any warmth. The forest around me was silent—not just quiet, but wrong. No birds, no insects, not even the rustle of leaves in the breeze. Just… stillness.

The circle of stones was gone, but the ground where it had been was bare, scorched in a perfect ring. I stood, my legs trembling beneath me, and spun in place, searching for any sign of the others.

“Sarah?” I called, my voice cracking. “Eric? Jenn?”

Nothing.

I don’t know how long I stood there, my heart pounding as the silence pressed in. The only sound was my breathing, shallow and uneven, until something broke the quiet.

A faint tapping.

Not loud, but distinct. Rhythmic, like fingers drumming against wood. It came from deeper in the forest.

I should’ve run. Every instinct screamed at me to turn and bolt, to leave the cabin, the woods, everything behind. But something pulled me forward.

The path back to the cabin was gone. The trees seemed taller, their trunks twisting unnaturally. I tried to retrace my steps, but no matter which direction I walked, the tapping grew louder.

Eventually, I saw it: a figure standing in the shadows between two trees.

It was Nate.

Or at least, it looked like Nate. He was facing away from me, his head tilted at an unnatural angle. His clothes were torn, his skin pale and waxy.

“Nate?” I whispered.

He turned slowly, and I froze.

His face was almost right, but not quite. His eyes were empty sockets, his mouth stretched too wide in a smile that didn’t belong. He lifted one hand and tapped it against the trunk of a tree, slow and deliberate.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Behind him, more figures emerged from the shadows. Their faces were blank—featureless, smooth skin where eyes, noses, and mouths should’ve been. They moved toward me, their heads tilting in unison, as if studying me.

I stumbled backward, tripping over roots and falling hard onto the soft, spongy ground.

“Don’t follow me!” I screamed, scrambling to my feet.

But they didn’t stop. The tapping grew louder, more frantic, as if it was coming from everywhere at once.

I don’t remember how I got out.

One moment, I was running, branches clawing at my face and arms. The next, I was standing on the side of the highway, dirty and shaking, the forest looming dark and still behind me.

A passing trucker stopped and offered me a ride. He asked me what happened, but I couldn’t explain.

I didn’t even try.

It’s been weeks now, and I still can’t sleep. When I close my eyes, I see them: the Hollow Ones, their blank faces watching me from the trees.

The tapping hasn’t stopped either. I hear it everywhere—in the walls of my apartment, in the pipes, in the quiet moments before sleep.

Last night, I found a small stone on my kitchen counter. It was smooth and dark, etched with one of the symbols from the clearing.

I stared at it for what felt like hours, trying to convince myself that it wasn’t the same. It couldn’t be. I’d thrown it out the window, heard it hit the pavement below. I was sure of it.

But there it was, cold to the touch, heavier than it looked.

And then the tapping started again.

By morning, I couldn’t take it anymore. My hands shook as I fumbled with my phone, scrolling through my contacts until I found Sarah’s name.

I didn’t expect her to answer.

But she did.

Her voice was shaky, barely above a whisper. “You’ve been hearing it too, haven’t you?”

I didn’t ask how she knew. “Sarah, what’s going on? Why won’t it stop?”

There was a long pause. I could hear her breathing, shallow and uneven.

“They don’t let you leave,” she said finally. “Not for good. If we don’t go back, they’ll take us. Piece by piece.”

“Who’s they?”

Another pause. “I don’t know what they are. But I know what they want. They feed on us—on fear, on guilt. And once you’ve stepped into their circle, you’re theirs.”

Her words sent a chill down my spine. “Then what do we do?”

“We have to go back.”

We met at a diner off the highway.

Sarah looked like she hadn’t slept in weeks. Her hair was pulled back into a messy ponytail, and dark circles framed her eyes. She wasn’t alone.

Eric sat beside her, his jaw clenched tight. His usual cocky demeanor was gone, replaced by something quieter, more haunted.

And Jenn was there too. Her face was pale, her expression blank, but she nodded at me when I sat down.

For a moment, none of us spoke. We just sat there, surrounded by the faint hum of the diner.

“They’ve been following me,” Jenn said suddenly, breaking the silence. Her voice was flat, distant. “Every night, I hear them. And Nate… I think I see him sometimes. Standing in the hallway.”

My stomach twisted. “Do you think he’s alive?”

Sarah shook her head. “He’s gone. Whatever we saw in the woods… that wasn’t him.”

Eric leaned forward, his voice low. “We have to end this. If we don’t, they’re going to take all of us. You’ve seen the stones, right?”

I nodded.

“That’s their way of marking you. They’re calling us back.”

We drove back to the woods that night.

The road was darker than I remembered, the trees pressing in from both sides. Sarah’s hands gripped the wheel tightly, her knuckles white.

When we reached the cabin, it looked worse than before. The wood was darker, warped, and the windows were gone, replaced by empty black voids.

None of us wanted to go inside, but we had no choice.

“We need to find the clearing,” Sarah said, her voice trembling.

The path was harder to find this time, hidden beneath layers of fallen leaves and twisted roots. But the forest seemed to guide us, the air growing colder and heavier as we walked.

When we reached the clearing, the stones were back.

This time, they were glowing faintly, a pale blue light that pulsed in time with the tapping.

Jenn froze, her breath hitching. “Do you hear that?”

We all did. It was louder now, coming from the center of the circle.

As we stepped closer, the air grew thick, almost suffocating. The shadows around the clearing seemed to shift, moving in unnatural ways.

At the center of the circle was something new: a small, crude altar made of twisted branches and bones.

And on it was Nate’s jacket.

Jenn let out a strangled cry and rushed forward, but Sarah grabbed her arm, pulling her back.

“Don’t!” Sarah hissed. “That’s not him—it’s a trap.”

The tapping grew louder, more insistent, echoing in my skull. The stones seemed to hum, vibrating underfoot.

“What do we do?” Eric asked, his voice tight with panic.

Sarah pulled something from her bag: a worn, leather-bound book. “My grandmother… she told me stories about them. There’s a way to break the connection, but we have to do it together.”

She opened the book to a marked page, her hands shaking. The words were in a language I didn’t recognize, written in jagged, uneven script.

As Sarah began to chant, the forest seemed to come alive.

The trees groaned and twisted, their branches reaching toward the clearing. The shadows at the edges grew darker, shifting into figures—tall, thin things with hollow faces.

They moved closer, their heads tilting in unison as they watched us.

“Keep going!” Eric shouted, stepping in front of Sarah as if he could protect her.

But one of the figures reached for him, its hand impossibly long and pale.

Eric screamed as it touched his shoulder, and he collapsed to the ground. His body twitched, his mouth open in a silent scream, but his eyes… his eyes were gone.

Jenn grabbed my arm, her nails digging into my skin. “We have to stop them!”

Sarah’s voice grew louder, the chant faster, more desperate. The stones glowed brighter, the symbols burning into my vision.

The figures hesitated, their movements slowing.

And then, with a deafening crack, the circle of stones shattered.

The shadows dissolved, the air clearing in an instant. The forest was silent again, but this time, it felt right.

Eric’s body lay still on the ground, his face pale and blank. Jenn knelt beside him, sobbing, but Sarah pulled her away.

“We can’t stay,” Sarah said, her voice hollow.

As we turned to leave, I glanced back at the altar. Nate’s jacket was gone.

And in his place was a small, dark stone etched with a new symbol.

It was different from the others—sharper, more intricate. The edges seemed to shimmer in the faint moonlight, and as I stared at it, I swore it was pulsing in time with my heartbeat.

“Leave it,” Sarah said sharply, her voice trembling. She gripped my arm, pulling me away. “Don’t touch it.”

Jenn knelt beside Eric’s body, her sobs cutting through the silence. His chest still rose and fell faintly, his breath shallow and labored, but his eyes… they were gone. The empty sockets seemed to watch us anyway, unblinking and unnervingly aware.

“We can’t leave him here,” Jenn whispered, her voice breaking. “We can’t just—he’s still alive.”

Sarah hesitated, looking at him, then back at me. “He’s not the same,” she said quietly. “He’s marked. Like the stones. If we bring him back…”

Jenn stood abruptly, glaring at her. “You don’t get to decide that. He’s coming with us.”

I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t even know if I agreed with her, but the thought of leaving him here in the clearing, like an offering, felt wrong.

We carried him back to the car. His body was heavy and cold, and his breathing grew shallower with each step. The tapping had stopped, but the forest was still wrong. The trees didn’t move, but I felt them watching us.

When we finally reached the car, Eric stirred. Jenn nearly dropped him in surprise as his head lolled to the side.

“Eric?” she whispered.

His mouth twitched, almost like a smile, but his voice wasn’t his. It was too low, too distant, like it was coming from somewhere else entirely.

“They’re not done,” he said.

Jenn froze, her grip tightening on his arm. “What—what do you mean?”

Eric didn’t answer. His body went limp again, and Jenn started crying, begging him to wake up. Sarah looked at me, her face pale and tight with fear.

We drove in silence, the tension in the car so thick it was suffocating. Eric was propped up in the back seat, his head resting against the window. Every so often, his body would jerk, like he was caught in a nightmare.

Jenn wouldn’t stop staring at him. “He’s going to be okay,” she said, more to herself than to us. “We just need to get him home. He’ll be fine.”

But we all knew she was lying.

It wasn’t until we pulled into the gas station near the edge of the woods that I noticed the stone.

It was sitting on the dashboard, perfectly centered. The same dark stone from the clearing, the new symbol etched deep into its surface.

“I told you not to touch it,” Sarah hissed, her voice shaking.

“I didn’t,” I shot back, my stomach twisting. “I swear, I didn’t.”

But there it was, pulsing faintly in the dim light.

Eric stirred again. His head rolled forward, and this time, his eyes were open—black pits, endless and empty. His lips curled into a slow, unnatural grin.

“They’ll come for you,” he said, his voice layered with something else. Something not human.

Jenn screamed, scrambling out of the car, but Sarah didn’t move. She was staring at Eric, her face pale and rigid.

“We have to go back,” Sarah said finally, her voice barely above a whisper.

“No,” I said, shaking my head. “We broke the circle. We ended it.”

Eric laughed, low and guttural. “You didn’t break anything. You only opened the door wider.”

The air around us grew colder, the lights of the gas station flickering. I turned to look out the window, and there, standing at the edge of the woods, were the figures.

Tall. Silent. Watching.

We left the car at the station and walked into the night, too afraid to stay but unsure where to go. The tapping started again, faint but relentless, echoing in our minds no matter how far we went.

We carried Eric with us, though he didn’t speak again. He didn’t need to.

We knew.

They weren’t done with us. Not yet.

And no matter where we went, they would follow.
