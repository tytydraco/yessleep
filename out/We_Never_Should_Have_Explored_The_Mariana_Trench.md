We had been prepared and trained for the descent into the Mariana Trench, yet I sensed an eerie atmosphere when we began the journey downwards. The pressure was intense both inside and outside of our vessel, and the atmosphere seemed incredibly oppressive. It was like being in a sensory deprivation tank only lit up occasionally by little flashes of light. My heart raced faster as we got to the bottom of the abyss.

We were going somewhere no human had ever gone before, giving me an inexplicable feeling of dread. Despite this, I tried to push these emotions aside so that our team could begin their environmental observations. But then, without warning, all power to our submarine was cut off plunging us into complete darkness, instilling fear among my colleagues. I could hardly hear anything besides my own breath and the sound of my racing heart. We tried turning the lights back on, but it was no use.

All of a sudden, there was an eerie growl coming from outside the submarine. At first, we thought it might be some deep-sea creature showing its distress at our presence, but then I saw what was causing it: a massive shape that I couldn't make out in the darkness. The next moments were filled with fear and dread.

We attempted to steer away from the monster, but realized we were no match for it. It seemed as if it held us captive, cherishing our terror until it chose to attack us. The beast lunged at the submersible and battered it with tremendous force; I could feel the metal straining under this terrifying pressure, thinking that soon enough we would be crushed beyond repair. Miraculously, we managed to escape and head up towards safety.As we pulled away from the edge of that forgotten world, I felt a sense of relief.

But it was fleeting; we had come too close to something that no human could comprehend. Our brief encounter with an ancient evil remained as a haunting reminder. It was hard to forget the terror we experienced, but our journey had not been in vain. We'd witnessed something truly incredible, and even if it came with a cost, I was filled with amazement at the power and enigma of the deep. This experience had transformed me, and it would forever change how I saw the sea.

Just before the mysterious entity left, I shone my flashlight out of the window and caught a glimpse of what appeared to be an appendage of something much larger. A massive black leviathan lurked in the depths of the abyss miles below us. It moved slowly, before sinking deeper into the depths and out of my view as I sighed with relief. Our ascent was silent, and all of my crew mates were thankful to have made it out of the incident alive. We had encountered what was probably the largest scientific find of the century, and the scars on our submarine and the videos were proof enough of its existence.

The depths were harboring secrets beyond my comprehension, and I got to observe them first-hand. But as I pen this now, I can't help feeling that the creature is still out there, waiting for its next target. And I can't help asking myself, [what other terrors](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/mjn4ot/the_complete_seaside_trilogytimeline_in_order/) are crawling in the Mariana Trench?
