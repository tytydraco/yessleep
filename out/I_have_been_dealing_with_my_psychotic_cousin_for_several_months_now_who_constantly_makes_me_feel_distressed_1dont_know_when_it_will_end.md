Every few weeks, my cousin Dilly inexplicably finds his way to my doorstep late at night, and each visit brings more unnerving experiences. No matter how hard I try to understand or explain it, his presence defies all rationality.

The first encounter occurred several months ago and was severely distressing. I live alone, but when I heard a knock at my door, and when I opened it, he was already inside the house, standing right behind me. He then transformed into a 30g packet of amber leaf tobacco and started doing kick flips all over the walls. It has been stressing both me and my guinea pig Smashton.

This continued with similar experiences for the coming weeks. Determined to capture evidence of the strange happenings, I let Dilly in, discreetly setting up a hidden camera. But my attempt was futile, for as soon as he stepped inside, the room began to transform. The air filled with an ominous aroma, and before my eyes, chocolate semen started seeping from the floor, slowly engulfing the room.
I watched in horror as the liquid formed a sinister pool, and from its depths arose a distorted image of Dilly. His features contorted, and his innocent face twisted into a malevolent grin. Without a word, he darted out of the room, leaving me to confront the nightmarish aftermath.
My anxiety has escalated to new heights. I feel like a puppet trapped in a macabre puppet show, with Dilly as the puppeteer, pulling the strings of my reality.

Determined to find some semblance of sanity, I confided in my Aunt, hoping she might have an explanation. But even she seems strangely indifferent to Dilly's inexplicable visits. Her response was chillingâ€”a faint smile forming beneath a slightly visible moustache that sent shivers down my spine. Her eyes held a flicker of something unknown, and I couldn't shake the feeling that she knew more than she let on.

As weeks turned into months, my fear and unease has just intensified. My guinea pig, Smashton, seems to sense the strange energy that clings to the house, and his once playful and curious nature has withered away. I notice him hiding more often, as if trying to escape the unsettling presence that lingers within the walls.
One sleepless night, unable to bear the torment any longer, I decided to confront Dilly directly. With a mixture of apprehension and determination, I waited for his inevitable arrival. As the clock stroke midnight, the door creaks open, and there he stands, wearing an expression that mirrors my own confusion.

"Dilly, what's happening? Why are you here? What do these strange occurrences mean?" I pleaded, hoping for an explanation, for any shred of normalcy to return.

But Dilly remained silent, his eyes filled with a glimmer of sadness and longing. In that moment, I felt a pang of empathy for my young cousin, realizing that whatever force is drawing him here is beyond his control.

I don't know when this will end, or if anyone has experienced similar things, but I really am at a loss for where to go from here.
