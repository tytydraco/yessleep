A year ago, I was tasked by my parents to check on their house every week while they were traveling abroad. The drive to and from my hometown is conveniently the duration of an episode from my favorite podcasts, so I did not mind the weekly escapism on the road. Another comfort of mine for impromptu road trips was usually taking Bruno with me, but he was misbehaving so incessantly during the first house check-in that I figured long-distance travel gives him anxiety now. In preparation for the second check-in, I left him at my house with his all-time favorite treat.

The hour-and-a-half drive went by in a flash. As I walked towards the front doorstep, I noticed an envelope tucked underneath the doormat. I pulled it out and examined the outside thoroughly—sealed, no postmark, no addresses, no ink at all. Breaking the seal revealed a sliver of paper with a QR code in the center. I skeptically looked around the neighborhood before I unlocked the front door and entered my parents’ home.

Bewildered on the couch, I scanned the QR code with my phone's camera which prompted a link to pop up. I have always been cautious of phishing scams but the URL itself seemed to be a legitimate YouTube link. Out of pure curiosity, I clicked on it, causing the YouTube app to open with an unlisted video titled “New Home, New Adventures, New Memories (Part 1)”.

My eyes darted around the page and landed on the channel name “New Resident”. When I clicked on it, I was further perplexed by the channel’s emptiness—blank profile picture, no public videos, no description. Shrugging it off, I went back to the video and pressed play.

**Video Series Part 1 - Grocery Shopping**

The video begins with an amateurish-looking title card “New Home, New Adventures, New Memories” followed by texts that fade in and fade out—“A Choose Your Own Adventure Series” and “Part 1 - Grocery Shopping.” It then cuts to a POV shot of a person walking through an aisle inside a store. Glimpses of a shopping cart can be seen at the bottom of the frame with contents appearing to be boxes of food, a set of kitchen knives and utensils, and other supplies just out of frame.

In an almost disorienting fashion, the video frequently cuts to random shots of the POV panning the items on the shelves or turning into different aisles, each shot being sped up more than the last. The last shot includes the POV speed walking down a wider walkway and then a freeze frame with white text that says “What should I buy next for my new home?”

The video ends with two clickable options on the screen: “Mug” or “Kitchen Gloves”

\*\*\*

My eyebrows were furrowed throughout this mundane yet moderately-edited vlog. Was I supposed to find this video entertaining? Who thought a QR code on people’s doorstep was a good way to advertise this so-called series? Questions were racing in my head, but I left little time for contemplation before clicking on the “Kitchen Gloves” option. YouTube opened another unlisted video titled “New Home, New Adventures, New Memories (Part 2)”.

\*\*\*

**Video Series Part 2 - Drive-Thru**

The video begins just like Part 1 except now with the text “Part 2 - Drive-Thru”. It cuts to a POV shot of the person reaching for yellow kitchen gloves in the store and then exiting the building. The next shot is the POV driving on the road followed by a side glance towards the passenger seat where a plastic grocery bag sits, exposing yellow kitchen gloves and a mug engraved with black text.

Just as disorienting as Part 1, the video frequently cuts to random shots of the POV panning beyond the windshield and turning into different roads, each shot being sped up more than the last. The last shot includes the POV at an intersection turning into a road where you can see multiple fast food restaurants in the distance and then a freeze frame with white text that says “From which restaurant’s drive-thru should I pick up food?”

The video ends with two clickable options on the screen: “McDonald’s” or “Jack in the Box”

\*\*\*

A wave of goosebumps appeared on my arms when I observed the freeze frame closely. The intersection and restaurants shown in the video were a 5-minute drive away from my parents’ house. My brain had not processed whether the close proximity of this person is something worrisome or simply innocuous, especially if other folks in the neighborhood had received a similar envelope.

I reassured myself that the nature of the questions at the end of each video lends to the silliness of the series and its creator, so I proceeded and clicked on the “McDonald’s” option. The next unlisted video was titled “New Home, New Adventures, New Memories (Part 3)”.

\*\*\*

**Video Series Part 3 - Home Sweet Home**

The video begins just like Parts 1 and 2 except now with the text “Part 3 - Home Sweet Home”. It cuts to a POV shot of the person in the car entering a McDonald’s drive-thru. The video then cuts to the POV leaving the drive-thru followed by a side glance towards the passenger seat where a greasy bag of McDonald’s sits, now eclipsing the view of the grocery bag.

Deviating from the patterns of Parts 1 and 2, the video cuts to black for a few seconds and then cuts to the POV parking on a suburban street with the sun glaring over the horizon. The last shot includes the POV approaching the house to the left with an SUV parked on the driveway and then a freeze frame with white text that says “How should I enter my new home?”

The video ends with two clickable options on the screen: “Front Door” or “Bedroom Window”

\*\*\*

My eyes widened, my heart sank to my stomach, and chills ran down my spine upon seeing my parents’ SUV and house in the video. My breath quivered as I tried to inhale and then exhale deeply. Not sure what to do next, I carefully peeked through the blinds; my car and my parents’ SUV were still outside, nothing or nobody else in sight. I then turned my head forward, cautiously glancing towards the back of the house.

My body’s fight-or-flight response defaulted to a third option: freeze. My eyes slowly returned to my phone with the hope that the next video gives me the courage to do something, anything proactive. My body buried itself further into the couch as I clicked on the “Front Door” option, which led to an unlisted video titled “New Home, New Adventures, New Memories (Part 4)”.

\*\*\*

**Video Series Part 4 - Home Protection**

The video begins just like Parts 1, 2, and 3 except now with the text “Part 4 - Home Protection”. It cuts to a POV shot of the person’s gloved hand frantically trying to open the front door but to no avail. The video then cuts to the POV going around the house, opening the gate to the backyard, and approaching a window behind the house. The gloved hands open the window with ease, and the POV enters the house and goes into a bedroom.

In a similar vein as Parts 1 and 2, the video frequently cuts to random shots of the POV panning family pictures on the wall and turning into new areas of the house, each shot being slowed down more than the last, each shot becoming dimmer and dimmer as night begins to fall, each shot having a large kitchen knife entering more and more into frame, each shot having the knife graze deeper and deeper into the surface of every subsequent family picture. The last shot of this sequence lingers on a closeup of a man’s face with the knife’s tip slowly twisting on the man’s forehead.

The video then cuts to the POV facing towards the front door with headlights projecting onto the front windows. After the headlights outside turn off, the video is solely illuminated by the street light filtering through the blinds. The POV and the knife at the corner of the frame leisurely advance towards the door. All of a sudden, a loud barking emanates outside.

The POV instantly pivots, runs through the darkness of the house while panting, and closes a bedroom door behind them. The video footage continues to roll but is now completely black. The unrelenting barking and the voice of a man emerge inside the house and become more and more audible. A sudden light under the bedroom door illuminates the video ever so slightly, and the deafening barks are now on the other side of the door.

The video cuts to the bedroom window backlit by the moon, with gloved hands coming into frame and slowly opening the window. It then cuts to a POV shot outside of the house facing towards the other side of the now-closed window. The POV crouches and moves towards the gate. The next shot is the POV casually approaching their car. Their non-gloved hand reaches for the handle, only to stop when the house’s front door opens.

POV turns around, and a medium-sized dog runs into frame, barking at peak volume. The barking continues for several seconds. The POV slowly leans down and extends their hand out, allowing the dog to briefly become silent and smell their hand. After a few seconds of sniffing, the hand slowly moves around the dog’s head and begins scratching behind the dog’s ears. A man from a distance jogs towards the POV and into frame.

Man: “So sorry about that, Bruno has been barking nonstop since I got here. Hope he didn’t scare you.”

POV: “No worries. Dogs will do everything they can to protect their owners. I was just about to be on my way. Are you heading out too?”

Man: “Yeah. Just wanted to stop by the house. And check my parents.”

POV stands up. Bruno resumes barking.

Man: “Alright, alright, calm down Bruno. It’s time to go home. Very sorry again, hope you have a good rest of your night.”

POV: “Thanks, you too... See you later.”

The last shot includes the POV entering their car while tossing a large backpack into the backseat and then a freeze frame with white text that says “To be continued.”

The video cuts to black and ends.

\*\*\*

Hyperventilation. Sweats. Panic. I remembered approaching this man the week before. He had worn glasses, dark clothes, and a backpack. His last words to me echoed in my mind: “See you later.” The adrenaline finally compelled my body to stand up, leave the house, lock the door, and rush to my car. My hands shook violently as I dialed 9-1-1. I tried my best explaining to the call taker everything that happened—the envelope, the unlisted videos, the intruder.

After the call taker said cops should be arriving shortly and ended the call, a thought immediately occurred to me: I need to gather as much evidence as possible. I started screen recording my phone and returned to the YouTube app, only to see the error message “This video has been removed by the uploader.” I pressed the back button, and it was more of the same for the other three videos. There was no longer a way for me to access the “New Resident” channel either. Any evidence that these videos existed was gone forever.

Defeated, I sat idly by in my car waiting for the police.

\*\*\*

A few weeks later, I told my parents everything when they returned from their stress-free, month-long trip. To my relief, they believed me and were not upset that I had not told them earlier. It was absolutely imperative that I helped them get a security system, doorbell camera, and backyard camera installed right away. The intruder was still somewhere out there.

After investigation, the police reported several fast food wrappers being the only things present in the outdoor trash can. The wrappers were from Jack in the Box and McDonald’s. Unfortunately, the police investigation amounted to nothing further. No signs of the intruder leaving any of his belongings behind. No unusual fingerprints or DNA on the envelope, piece of paper, food wrappers, doors, my old bedroom window, or the scratched family photos. No useful testimonials from neighbors. No way to view the deleted videos from the QR code link. Even my description of the intruder and his car ended up being too general and vague.

The police ultimately agreed that a security system was the best path forward and that if there is any other suspicious activity relevant to the investigation, please report it back to them.

\*\*\*

Today, I decided to visit my parents’ home. After months of repressed feelings and skirting around the topic, the three of us finally reflected on last year’s events.

Me: “So… has anything out of the ordinary happened ever since the security system was installed? Any weird strangers popping up around the neighborhood?”

Dad: “Other than you and Bruno, I don’t think so.”

Mom: “Yeah, no mysterious wrappers from Wendy’s or McDonald’s appearing in the trash can. So that’s a plus. Of course, I still get scared at night thinking about an evil man walking around my home with a knife.”

Me: “I still get nightmares too. And not that it matters, it was Jack in the Box, not Wendy’s. Guess the dude’s not a fan of square patties… I still find it funny how his videos were supposed to be a Choose Your Own Adventure game and I chose McDonald’s for the guy, but he just couldn’t resist also getting a Jumbo Jack. Like at least have some damn integrity.”

My dad’s eyes widened.

Me: “What? Too soon for me to tell dad jokes?”

Dad: “No. You just reminded me of something. From the videos you described.”

My dad walked over to a kitchen cabinet and tried to reach for something. My mom peered from behind.

Dad: “Not sure exactly when, but about a month ago, I found this in the sink one morning and didn’t think much of it. I use it a lot nowadays but I'm 100% certain it wasn’t in this house before.”

Mom: “Oh really honey? I thought maybe you bought that.”

After my dad pulled it out, I felt my heart pounding in my chest. I was in utter shock. My parents gauged my reaction, almost as a confirmation, and quickly came to the same realization as me.

It was a mug with the engraving: [“New Home, New Adventures, New Memories”](https://i.imgur.com/2eQB0zJ.jpeg).
