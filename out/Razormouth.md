I have been reading a lot of stories online about urban myths and serial killers as I have had an experience with one that fits in both categories. I am not a storyteller per say but honestly this is the only way I can tell my experience to anyone reading. I am just an ordinary person who works a normal job and honestly what I saw haunts me every time I close my eyes. I am writing this journal as I feel that whatever or whoever I saw that day will finally come to close my chapter.

It happened in November, the weather was more like autumn as winter had not yet started so the temperature was cold but somehow bearable to me, the night felt crisp honestly and I did not have to cover my mouth and could breath in the cold air. I lived 2 blocks from the bus stop so I took my time walking as I enjoyed it, my car was in the shop for its service which was why I am walking home. The area I live is a middle class suburban type of place with single story houses, my place was my parents’ before they passed on. I liked it and saved me a bunch in rent and other costs. The street was empty at this time of night which suited me, as I walked I took the time to look at other houses noting that many still had their lights on as it was around 9:30.

As I walked I came across a house that was in complete darkness, this was odd as our area did not have the usual empty houses and such like. The occupants’ cars were still parked in front of their garage so one could surmise they were home, the odd thing was that the front door was open and a window looked broken. The window that was broken was the living room one so I stopped to get a better look and saw a hand sticking out the front door, it was resting on the floor. I slowly took a few steps toward the house to get a better look and see if I could help, as I got closer to the front porch I stopped.

There was blood oozing out the front door and slowly making its way to the front steps, I took a step back and then slowly another. I did not want to get caught in a situation that could lead me to the same fate so I began retreating further and as was about to turn and run home I saw it. I refer to her, she looked like she was left out in the sun to dry as the skin looked white as paper to me even in the semi light. I was transfixed by the sight and slowly a hand was raised by her and she placed it on the window, the window was the one I supposed to being in the dining area. Placing the open hand on the window I could see it was covered in a red paint of sort, she began to slowly move it side by side like as she was waving to me while leaving streaks of the red paint on the glass . Then I saw the worst thing I could not ever imagine, she opened her mouth and in the light it let of glints of sharp things I could only guess to be razors like the box cutter type. I lost my composure and ran, my house was 4 minutes away but it felt like 4 days to me, I ran to the front door and fumbled in my pockets to look for the keys all the while looking to see if I wasn’t followed.

Entering my home I sank to the floor I tried to steady my breath and remembered that I have a phone and should call the police, I fished out my phone and tried to call a few times. My hands were shaking uncontrollably but finally I managed to call and waited for them to pick. The operator picked and I basically blurted everything out in a couple of seconds to which the operator tried to calm me down. I took a few breaths as told and recounted everything to her and gave the address, she let me know that a unit will be sent to check up on the place. While that was happening she asked if I have locked my door and checked my home also to which I panicked as I looked up at my door, I jolted up and lock it. I told her that I lived alone and always lock up, she told me to remain calm and keep the phone close as she will call again to check up on me. I closed the call and switched on the lights to my home and made my way to the kitchen where I sat down on the dinner table, the adrenaline was wearing off and I felt like I was drowning in warm water.

I think I may have passed out as when I woke my phone was ringing and so was the front door, I saw it was police calling. I picked up and it was the operator, she asked if I was ok and I told her I had passed out from exhaustion, I got up and walked to the front door. She let me know that this happens when you are involved in such situations and should take a bath before getting some rest. Looking through the spy hole on my door I could see there were 2 officers standing outside, I let the operator know this and she let me know that she had asked to check up on me also. I opened the door while keeping the line active, the officers introduced themselves and I nodded. The operator said that I should talk to the officers and will be cutting the call now.

I cut the line and put my phone back in my pocket and let the officers in, I led them to the living room and we sat down. One of the officers tried to comfort me by talking about my place. It was a short banal conversation but it helped, I then told them my account for the night. The listened without a word and when I finished asked for a clear description of the figure I saw and tired my best to give them one but honestly even that description felt off, the face I saw looked like a badly made ghost mask but honestly it still is scarier to think of now. They told me to be vigilant as this was the first case in this area and they fear there could be more and that since I saw this person I may be in some danger now. I asked what happened to the family in that house, what they told me brought shivers to my core.

“Honestly Miss, we don’t know. There are no bodies in the house but there was blood everywhere its like the perp tried to repaint the house in their blood. I know we should not be speaking to you about this but you saw the blood on the front door. Beyond that we cannot figure out who or what this person is but whoever they are have the FBI looking for them also. So here is where I ask you, is there a place you can go to for a while or at least till we catch this killer. Its for your own safety.”

I told them that I had no other family or place I could go to as this was the only home I had. They considered this and one of them excused himself and walked out the front door to make call. The one still sitting told me that if I did not have place to go to then another option was witness protection which was brought up by the agents. I knew that once in witness protection I would basically start again and by the looks of it I had no other choice left.

Its been 6 months since I was moved to this random town, given few resources to start my life again I did my best. At first it was ok and things weren’t so bad, I got used to the life. It was then I started to notice things happening at night. There would be noises from outside my apartment like someone pacing around to tapping on the windows.

I called the police a few times and in most cases it turned out to be nothing but they swore that could feel like someone was watching them. I was becoming paranoid myself, I called the agent assigned to me and asked if could be moved and he informed me that it was impossible as he did not have another place I could be moved to.

I asked why the investigation was really taking so long and he did not have an answer but said that I was the only tangible witness to this serial killer’s crimes. I was confused, since I checked online there were no mention of such crimes on the news sites and asked why. He informed me that it was being kept out of the news as there were no bodies only blood trails and missing bodies that could easily be recorded as fraudulent death reports. The real problem was that locations of every crime was random and nothing connected them at all.

I was getting worried by all this and now I am getting even more paranoid as there have been scratch marks on my door and windows, I tried to use a camera to catch the prankster but nothing. There were now knockings in the middle of the night and even whispers of a voice. I am scared that soon I will be next.

Today I found a bloody razor on my doorstep, it was just laid on the doorstep. Please help.
