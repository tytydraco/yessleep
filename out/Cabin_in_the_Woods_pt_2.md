I’m back, and I know I owe you all an explanation. After my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/3EDxZaI8nW), I bolted from the diner without responding to a single comment. At the time, I thought I was being paranoid, that maybe I just needed to clear my head. But looking back now, I think I was running. Not from the town, not from the cabin, but from the feeling that something was closing in.

I told myself I’d come back, that I’d sit down and properly respond when I had the time. But the truth is, I didn’t want to face your questions—or your answers. Because acknowledging it, writing it down again, made it feel real. And I didn’t want it to be real.

I’ve spent the last few days trying to convince myself that what I saw, what I felt, could be explained. But I can’t. The forest, the clearing, it—it’s all still here, pressing on the edges of my mind. I can’t escape it, not in the cabin, not even in the town.

I’m writing this now because I can’t keep it inside anymore. The fear, the questions, the need to understand—it’s all too much. I don’t know if I’m posting this because I want answers or because I’m hoping someone will tell me I’m not crazy. Maybe it’s both.

I didn’t respond before, but I will this time. I’ll stick around, no matter how hard it gets to read what you all have to say. Because I think I need to know. I need to know what’s happening to me before it’s too late.

Looking back on Days 4 and 5, I realize how much I let my guard down. At the time, everything felt normal—calm, even. I convinced myself the odd things I’d experienced were just my imagination: the open door on Day 2, the smell of smoke that had no source, the uneasy vibe of the forest. I kept telling myself they had logical explanations because it was easier to believe that than to face the alternative.

I told myself the cabin wasn’t creepy, just old, and the forest wasn’t watching me, just unfamiliar. I even began to enjoy the solitude. I started repairing the house, reading on the porch, and thinking the isolation was helping me reset. I genuinely believed the worst was in my head, that I was overreacting. But that sense of calm… it wasn’t peace. It was the eye of the storm.

Day 6 was when it all fell apart.

I don’t know what possessed me to go into the woods today. Something about the morning was wrong from the start. The light filtering through the windows had that odd quality again, making the dust in the air look like it was suspended in amber. It felt too quiet outside, like the world was holding its breath. I should’ve stayed inside, but the cabin wasn’t a refuge anymore. The walls felt too close, the silence too loud. Every creak of the old wood made my skin crawl. So I grabbed my bag, stuffed it with water and a flashlight, and stepped out onto the porch.

The forest loomed around me, its twisted branches clutching at the gray sky. The air was thick and damp, clinging to my skin like a second layer. I told myself I just needed to clear my head, to prove to myself the woods were just woods.

But they aren’t.

At first, it was uneventful. The trails were overgrown, but they were there, faint paths carved by animals or long-forgotten footsteps. The ground was soft with moss, muffling my steps. I kept telling myself this was fine, that I’d turn back after an hour or so.

Then the forest started to change.

The trees grew closer together, their trunks twisted and leaning inward, their branches tangling above me to block out the light. The air became heavier, carrying a faint, metallic tang that turned my stomach. The moss underfoot gave way to bare dirt, dry and cracked as if it hadn’t seen rain in years.

I don’t know when I first noticed the carvings. They were subtle at first—marks in the bark that could have been the result of animals or weather. But the deeper I went, the more deliberate they became. Spirals, jagged lines, and shapes that made my head hurt if I looked at them too long.

And then there were the bones. Tiny piles scattered along the trail—small and fragile, like bird bones, but arranged too neatly to be natural. I stepped around them, careful not to disturb the patterns. The back of my neck prickled, like someone was watching me, but every time I turned around, there was nothing. Just trees.

By the time I stumbled into the clearing, I was ready to turn back. But the moment I saw it, my feet froze.

The clearing wasn’t right. The ground was packed dirt, perfectly circular, surrounded by trees that leaned inward like they were bowing. In the center was a structure—a pile of sticks and stones that looked like it had been thrown together by a madman. The angles were wrong, almost impossible, and staring at it made my vision blur, like my brain couldn’t process it.

The air was electric, buzzing faintly against my skin. Around the edges of the clearing were more piles of bones, larger now, human-sized. Symbols were etched into the dirt, their lines so precise they could’ve been cut with a blade.

And then I heard it.

At first, it was just a low rumble, so deep I felt it in my chest more than I heard it. I told myself it was thunder, but the sky above was gray and still. The sound grew louder, more distinct—a guttural, rasping noise that made my skin crawl.

I scanned the treeline, and that’s when I saw movement.

Shapes, dark and shifting, slipping between the trees like shadows that didn’t belong. I couldn’t tell how many there were. They moved too fast, too fluid, like they weren’t bound by the rules of this world.

Then they stepped into the clearing.

People—or something that used to be people. They wore dark robes that hung from their bodies like wet paper, their faces hidden in shadow. They didn’t speak, but I could feel their attention on me, their collective gaze pressing down like a physical weight.

I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn’t move.

And then, from behind the altar, it appeared.

I don’t have words for it. I’ve tried to put it into language, but nothing fits. It was tall—taller than any human has a right to be—but wrong, like its limbs had been stretched too far. Its skin was pale, almost translucent, and its face… if you could call it a face, was a hollow mask, featureless except for the faint impression of eyes.

It moved like it was gliding, its body too smooth, too deliberate. The air around it seemed to ripple, like the space it occupied didn’t want it there.

The robed figures began to hum, a low, droning sound that seemed to vibrate through my skull. I wanted to cover my ears, but my arms wouldn’t obey. The thing behind the altar turned its hollow face toward me, and in that moment, I swear I felt it inside my mind, sifting through my thoughts like they were pages in a book.

I don’t remember running. I don’t remember how I got back to the cabin. The next thing I knew, I was inside, the door locked, my back pressed against it as I gasped for air.

The silence inside was deafening, but I knew it wasn’t safe. Not anymore. The woods aren’t just alive—they’re waiting.

And I think they’re waiting for me.


I’m posting this from the cabin. I don’t even know if it’ll go through. The signal’s weak, flickering in and out like everything else around here. I can’t bring myself to leave, not after what happened. The idea of stepping outside—of being exposed to whatever’s out there—makes my stomach churn. Every creak of the wood, every gust of wind against the windows feels like it’s something waiting to get in. Or maybe it already is in, and I just can’t see it yet.

I’m terrified.

But here’s the thing I can’t shake: I need to know. I need to understand what I saw out there, what’s happening in these woods. If I don’t, it’s going to eat me alive. Is it because I’m scared of losing my mind? Maybe. Or maybe it’s something worse—maybe it’s the same pull that led me into the woods this morning.

I don’t know what I’m going to do. Stay inside? Try to barricade myself and wait for what, though? Or go back out there and see if I can find more clues—answers, anything that makes this make sense. The idea of walking back into those trees makes my throat tighten, but so does the thought of sitting here and doing nothing.

It feels like the forest isn’t just waiting for me. It’s calling me.

I’ll respond to comments if I can. I don’t know when or if I’ll be able to leave again. If anyone has any idea what this could be—what I saw, what’s happening—please tell me. I need something to hold onto, anything.

For now, I’m staying put. But I don’t think it’s going to let me stay hidden for long.
