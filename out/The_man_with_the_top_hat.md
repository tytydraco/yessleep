He is getting closer to me, every few minutes I see him walk pass this room. I wish he would just leave, I wish I would awake from this nightmare.

I'm not crazy, atleast.... I don't think I am. As the minutes pass into hours, I don't know whats real and what isn't anymore.

 The day started out like any normal day, my alarm went off and I got up. I work from home, so I made a cup of coffee, checked my watch, and headed into my office. I say my office, it was more like a tiny closet. Anyways, as I sat down, and got situated I fired up my PC and checked my emails. I check my personal email, and then my work email. As my inbox was brought onto the screen, a email stood out to me. It was from a Gmail I didn't recognize. 

The title of the email was "today is the day", confused I clicked on it and began reading it. To empathize why this email scared me I will type it out word for word below.

>"Today is the day! Your day has finally come, and we are so proud of you. We know you are probably excited, but he couldn't be there until later today. Our apologies. - Sincerely DFS"

I honestly just assumed it was one of my friends playing a prank. It's not unusual for one of my friends to try to fuck with me like this. But something felt a bit off, like a feeling of discomfort when you walk through a dark room alone. I deleted the email and exited the window. I then proceeded to start my work day.

The day went by too slow, it was one of those days that feel endless. Finally it was 4:00 pm and I could end my work day. I left my office and made dinner. A hour or two passed and I decided to check my email on my phone. The email I deleted was back, and... it was updated. 

As I opened it, my whole body turned cold and I found it hard to stop shaking. 

>"UPDATE: We saw you accidently deleted our email Damien. We would like to update you from our recent email to you. The man with the top hat has been dispatched to your location. Your death is importent to us, and we hope our services were to your satisfaction."

The next thing I know I head my front doors knob jiggle and the lock proceeded to click, it was unlocked. I ran into my office and closed the door. I dialed 911, but  minutes passed and it was just a constant ringing.  I gave up and I started writing this. I remembered I had cameras, and loaded the feed onto my phone. As I looked, I saw a person. A person with a pale face, wearing a suit and a topcoat.

After 15 seconds the thing dissapeared. I changed cameras and it's face was I the cameras lens. I screamed and threw my phone across the room. I'm scared it will find me. It feels like a dream, but I don't think it is. It's almost midnight and it's starting to search closer to my location.
