I have a predictable morning routine.  I get up at 4am which gives me about 3 hours of solitude and quiet time before the rest of the family starts their day.  I get the whole first floor to myself since everyone is sleeping upstairs.  I spend about the first 2 hours doing my daily self-care, drinking coffee, and watching true crime YouTube content.  
If I have enough time left over after all of that,  I will lie back down on the couch for about 30 minutes,  put in earbuds, and turn on some type of meditation. 
We have a big chocolate lab and a small dachshund Jack Russel mix. Our lab is built like a horse but he is a big softie.  He has never behaved aggressively in any way. He will bark sometimes but the most noise he makes is just moving around the house,  sounds like a damn elephant stampede.  
Our little dog, on the other hand, is aggressive and barks when the wind blows, nothing gets past her.  She is always downstairs with me in the mornings as soon as I get up but passes out in her dog bed by the couch. Our lab is usually asleep upstairs in my daughters room but sometimes when he hears me lay down on the couch he will come barreling down the stairs wanting to go out.  It irks me but I get up,  let him out and then go back to whatever I was doing.  

I have learned to sit on the couch and wait a few minutes before getting comfortable to see if he’s going to react to the noise of me sitting down.  Sometimes he does wait until I am already playing my meditation in my earbuds to come down but he is so big and loud I always hear him coming down the steps no matter how deep into the meditation I am in. Also, I can always sense him panting, pacing around me or sitting by the couch so I know I need to get up. 

 But here is when things started getting weird. 

A few mornings ago,  I was almost done with my meditation and my timer was 3 minutes from going off, I did not hear him come down the steps or sense him pacing around.  I suddenly smelled “dog breath” and it was strong.  I slowly turned my head and he is sitting like a statue with his face really close to mine and just staring at me.  Even when I looked over at him,  he didn’t move a muscle, just sat there like a statue and didn’t budge.  I thought to myself that he was being creepy but figured he was just trying to be a good boy and not disturb me.  
I start getting up and finally he breaks out of the trance and goes to the door.  I don’t pay much attention to what he does after I let him back in but sometimes he does go back upstairs to my daughter’s room. 

I did take mental note that I never heard him or felt him that morning but I just chalked it up as being in a deep meditative trance and having my meditation up louder than usual. 

The next morning I had not been on the couch yet,  I came out of the bathroom around the corner and he was sitting there in the middle of the kitchen like a statue again just staring toward the bathroom.  I never heard him get up (which when he jumps off my daughter’s bed he sounds like an earthquake) and then I hear him coming down the steps. 

Even when I came out of the bathroom, he didn’t budge at all or react until I went over to the patio door to open it for him.  He shook himself out of the trance and went outside.  I got busy doing some other things since he will tap on the glass with his paw when he is ready to come back in.  I was waiting for it any minute. 
I checked out the door a few times and couldn’t see him (he tends to blend into the dark where the light doesn’t reach the way back). The yard is fenced in so he can’t wander off.  He will hang out there for quite awhile sometimes so I just went back to what I was doing.  I almost forgot about it until I heard him come barreling down the steps about 5 minutes later! 
I froze. I was really confused as to what just happened.  I knew I let him out.  I did not let him back in,  I did not remember him coming back inside. 

This freaked me out.  He went right up to the door and hit the glass to be let out.  My heart was racing and I was moving slow, my head was swirling with what just happened.  Just as I had started to accept maybe I did let him in and was too distracted and forgot about it already, I opened to sliding door and his haunches immediately raised. He sniffed the air for a minute, tucked his tail and turned around, sliding all over the hard wood floors to get back up the steps ( he is typically a really big wuss).  
Now my heart is like a jackhammer in my chest.  He has never ever behaved or reacted in that way at all.  My little dog is always reactive to him when he does get spooked and she will immediately start yapping and wanting to charge wherever she thinks the threat is.  
I look over at her and she is completely out. Just snoozing away like nothing is happening which is unusual for her. 
It took me awhile to rationalize all of this and come to a logical conclusion to push it off as some freak thing.

Well this morning,  I am in the middle of meditation again and I feel something breathing on me.  I smell the most rancid dog breath ever.  Both of my dogs have horrible breath but this was like something died and rotted in the sun for days.  It was so bad.  I turn my head and there is my dog, as still as a statue again,  staring intently at me except his eyes looked darker, and drool coming out of the side of his mouth.  He was also growling this deep guttural growl that I never heard from him before.  
We have had him since a puppy and he is 5 now.  He never behaved like this.  I jumped up spooked and it broke whatever trance he was in, he paced over to the door.  I was concerned maybe he was sick with the drool, bad breath and growling. 
I open the door, watch him go down the back steps while simultaneously hearing him come barreling down the steps from upstairs!!! Now I am thinking “F this”!! I slam the sliding glass door shut and lock it,  frantically searching the yard for whatever I had just let outside.  
My lab comes up and stands by me,  looks out the door and does the same thing as before.  He tucks tail and books it back upstairs.  This time my little dog does react and she comes charging over to the sliding glass door. Usually she is ready to charge in and take on whatever it is, no matter how big or bad it smells.  She will bark at the door until she is let out but this time,  she started whining and shaking intensely,  this is very out of character for her.  
So now I am wondering, what the hell has been coming to me in the mornings impersonating my dog? How did it get passed my little dog without so much as causing any reaction out of her the 3 times that it was right there… What is happening ? 
I would think I am crazy and imagining shit if it wasn’t for my dog's reactions. 
Most important,  I am terrified of when it will be back especially now that it has to know I am aware it is NOT my dog…
