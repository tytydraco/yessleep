When I was a boy, during summer vacation, my mom would drop me off at my aunt Tina’s house on her way to work. Tina didn’t babysit so much as abandon me. As soon as my mom’s car was out of sight, we’d hop in Tina’s car. She’d drive me to the library, drop me off, and pick me just before my mom arrived that evening. While waiting for my mom, Tina sat me in her kitchen with a glass of lukewarm sink water, crackers, and a stack of old Reader’s Digest—if I didn’t have a library book. Then, she’d disappear.

Her house rules were simple: no drinking the Pepsi in the fridge, stay in the kitchen, and play outside when possible. On cold or rainy days, though, I was confined to the kitchen.

And so was her cat.

The cat was terrifying. Huge. Shaggy. Dark gray. It crouched on the refrigerator, its lashing tail nearly touching the ceiling, its rolls of fat bulging over the sides. Its claws—long, yellowed, and wickedly sharp—hooked into the fridge’s surface, dimpling the metal.

Its amber eyes burned into me, glowing faintly, with an intensity that made my scalp prickle.

I tried to ignore it. I’d read a library book, flip through magazines, or stare at my hands, but its gaze was a physical weight. When I couldn’t take it anymore, I’d glance up.

Sometimes, it would yawn—a deep, guttural sound that exposed its jagged teeth, black muscular tongue, and the wet machinery of its jaws.

The yawns seemed intentional—like it was showing me its arsenal or telling me I was boring. It stretched out its impossibly long legs too. Once, I think one of its massive, kitty litter sprinkled paws, grazed the top of my cowlick. Then it would pull back, lick its lips, and settle again, shifting like it was preparing to pounce. I think the fridge would rock a little.

I told myself it was just a house cat. It wouldn’t hurt me. Dogs attacked people. Cats didn’t.

One evening, noticing my nervous glances at the cat, Tina said, “He doesn’t need me to feed him. He hunts in the ravine.”

I nodded, trying to look inquisitive while avoiding looking at the topic of discussion.

“He’s a good boy,” she continued, her tone reverent. “Keeps things safe.” She paused. “You know about Mr. Karp’s schnauzer, don’t you? The little shit that barked all the time?”

I hesitated. “Did it go missing?” I asked. I had seen the missing posters for various pets around the neighborhood.

Tina smiled faintly. “Yeah. But I don’t miss it.” she said, then turned and walked out of the kitchen, leaving me alone with the cat.

Its glowing eyes followed her retreat, then shifted back to me.

Whenever the weather was nice, I’d make sure the cat was on the fridge before slipping outside. The ravine behind Tina’s house, as creepy as it was, still felt safer than the kitchen.

It was in the ravine where I solved the mystery of the missing pets.

That day was overcast, and it was even darker in the ravine beneath its canopy of overgrown foliage and twisted branches. The air was damp, clammy, and laced with the scent of rotting leaves, stagnant water, and maybe a hint of sewage. To me, it seemed like a jungle, and I was an explorer. Maybe that’s why I wandered a bit further than usual, my footsteps crunching pleasantly on leaves and twigs and sinking slightly into the ground.

I was looking down at my shoes and imagining how Tina would react if I tracked mud into her kitchen when a flash of something silver and bright blue caught my eye. It was a dog collar, frayed on one side, with a silver tag on it. I bent down, picked it up, and examined it. The collar was still in a loop, and the buckle and dog tag were bent out of shape. I looked closer at the tag, trying to read it.

“What are you doing down here?”

I just about jumped out of my skin and swung around, my hands out in front of me defensively. One of them was holding the collar.

A man stepped out from the shadows. It was Tina’s neighbor, Mr. Karp. He’d seemed like a nice enough man when I’d occasionally seen him in his yard or walking his dog, but down here in the woods, he was too close, too tall. And the expression that crossed his face when he saw what was in my hand looked insane.

“What—what did you do to my dog?” he demanded, his voice rising in pitch with every word.

“Nothing!” I squeaked, cringing in fear, my eyes starting to well up. Without thinking, I began to turn slightly—unconsciously preparing to run.

The man grabbed my upper arm, his grip painfully tight and digging deep into my skin. “Tell me the truth!” he screamed, lifting his other hand to slap me.

Suddenly, a dark, gray mass slammed into the man, knocking him away from me, and both of us to the ground. The cat landed between us, its jaw unhinged, gaping impossibly wide. Its black tongue coiled out like a python, looping around the man’s ankles, thighs, and waist. And then, just as the man started to scream, the cat swallowed him whole.

The wet snap of its jaws echoed through the ravine, and for a moment, I thought I heard the faint muffled sound of the man still screaming.

The cat stood there, licking its lips. Its tail swished delicately, then its glowing eyes shifted to me. I lay there, too shocked to do anything.

It padded toward me slowly, its paws silent on the damp earth.

When it reached me, it leaned in close. Its breath was hot—rancid. Horrible. Then it rubbed its cold, wet nose against my cheek, purring.

That was forty years ago. I never told anyone what happened. Who would believe me? What would I even say? Tina never mentioned her neighbor again, but as his grass grew longer and people started asking questions, I think she knew.

When my aunt died, I went to her funeral. She was family, after all. No one talked about the huge cat she had all those years ago. Obviously, I wasn’t about to bring it up.

I’m not a cat person. Does that go without saying? I had a dog. When I got home from the funeral, he was gone. The cat was there instead, on my front porch, waiting. Purring.

I didn’t have the courage to turn it away. It hasn’t aged. Not a day. It’s as huge, shaggy, and gray as the day we met.  I’m gray now too, and now its claws curl into the top of my refrigerator, dimpling the metal.

When it wants out, I let it out. It disappears for hours, sometimes days, but like the proverbial cat from the song, it always comes back.

The town has changed. There are no stray dogs anymore. No birds in the trees. No homeless on the streets.

Sometimes, the cat coughs up things. A wallet, its leather bleached white, its contents a pulpy mass. A woman’s purse once, shredded and damp, its contents crushed and partially dissolved. I’ve found things in the litter box too—a crushed watch, jewelry. Rings. Little treasures caked with poop and sprinkled with kitty litter.

I burn what I can in my fire pit. I throw the rest out the window during long, lonesome, nighttime drives. What else am I supposed to do? Collect a mountain of evidence? Turn in my cat?

Once, I came home to find my front door hanging open. What I assume were burglary tools scattered across the floor. The cat was in the living room, sitting on an empty duffle bag that wasn’t mine, licking its claws. It burped when it saw me.

I don’t lock the doors anymore.

Sometimes, late at night, I fall asleep to the sound of its claws clicking on the floorboards. And I wake in the morning to the pressure of the cat’s weight on my chest.

Its eyes burn into mine, I feel its claws through my comforter. Its breath is still hot—rancid. Horrible.

I scratch its chin.

Its cold, wet nose bumps mine, and it purrs.
