I'm not sure if I'll regret this decision, but I think it's too late to think about that anyway.

I had a box of VCR tapes delivered to me a couple of days ago, only it wasn't really your normal delivery. 

It was more of like when a kid tries to prank you by ringing your doorbell and then running away, so you're greeted with nothing after you open the door, except instead of nothing, I was greeted with a box filled with 10 VCR tapes.

Curiosity got the better of me, so after a bit of searching, I ordered a VCR player from eBay.

It arrived fairly quickly, luckily I already had a compatible old TV stashed up in my garage.

My viewing experience began after I excitedly hooked up the VCR to the dusty TV that looked more like a mini fridge than a TV.

To better keep track of what I've watched, I'll transcribe these videos, one by one.


TAPE 1: POSTMAN


*Ring*

Robert (Opens his eyes): What the hell?

*Ring*

Robert (angrily whispers to self): I'm too damn hungover for this...

*Robert groggily walks to the door while the ringing continues, he looks at the peephole, strangely it seems to be either covered with something or blurred by some kind of liquid.*

Robert: Umm, hello?

Person at the other side of the door: Hello, Mister Robert! Got a package here for you!

Robert (scratching his head): Package, what package? 

Person at the other side of door: Oh yes, your name and address is written on it, says here you don't even have to pay for it. 

Robert: Well, I didn't order anything recently, must be some kind of mistake.

Person at the other side of door: I don't think it's a mistake, sir!

Robert: Yeah, how so?

Person at the other side of the door: Well, I looked at the info written on the package itself, looks like you won some kind of prize from the Coca Cola company.

Robert: No way!

Person at the other side of the door: I heard there's a random prize giveaway organized by the Coca Cola company going on recently, seems like they picked you as the winner, it's your lucky day, sir!

Robert (whispers to self): Was about time Coke rewarded me for drinking their bottled cancer for ages!

Robert: You sure I don't even have to pay for the delivery fees?

Person at the other side of door: Everything is paid for already, the only thing I need is your signature.

Robert: You really made my day, man! Been a while since I won anything! Let me just find my wallet and I'll give you a tip for your trouble.

Postman: That won't be necessary. Not trying to be rude, sir, but we postmen are busy people, we can't afford to lose too much time, so If you could kindly just open the door and take the package, I would be very grateful, As I already said, I'll just need your signature as proof that you received the package!

Robert: Sure thing, man! Let me just grab a pen so I can sign it!

*Robert scrambles to the living room, he tries to find a pen in his messy room, but he notices something that makes him freeze in place.*

Robert (YELLING) I'M CALLING THE POLICE!

*A blood chilling, almost animalistic screech followed by heavy, yet fast footsteps emerges from the other side of the door as soon as Robert finishes his sentence. In no more than 30 seconds, the sound of the main building door slamming shut is heard.*

*Robert quickly takes a peek at the window trying to see who or what exited the building, he momentarily sees an extremely tall figure that would put even the tallest of basketball players to shame disappearing in the darkness.*

*Robert slowly approaches the clock in his living room.*

Robert (while looking at the clock): Thanks buddy, I owe you one! 

*TIME ON THE CLOCK: 2:53 AM*

*TAPE ENDS*
