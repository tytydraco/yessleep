This post is not meant to glorify this behavior. I am sharing my personal experience and have already reported this to authorities. Below I will include a list of things and how they do it, including my experience as their subject. 

1. My family is being held hostage by multiple people in town. I have found wired in the ceiling that are transmitting a frequency.

2. First they gather a bunch of personal information on you and look at your daily patterns. Your pattern of movement, speech, emotional patterns, etc.

For me, this included using my friends and family 

3. Then they start to ask you open ended questions to see how you would respond. They want to associate a noise, word, smell, sight, or taste to something in your pattern.

4. After that they will try to recreate that situation on a repeated basis. So let's say you open a door a certain way, they will associate a sound with the opening of that door. They will then take that sound of the door opening and tie to something like an emotional response by greeting you the same way each time.

5. Once there is that pattern going. They will then see how you are after the pattern is established and carry on from that point.
Say you have 7 patterns in the day. They want to take one pattern, and turn it to 2 and then to 3 and so on.

6. Then from there, they can start to emotionally manipulate you. They will change the patterns to love you around in a way that they can control you.

By now this sounds like a pavlovian response. Training a dog to a sound cue, however the next part is where it gets disturbing and my current situation.

7. If you take a sound cue and associate it with an emotional response, thats parenting. However you can then tie that sound cue to an emotional memory of the emotional response. Ie you go sound cue > emotional response > emotional memory > emotional response of that memory > and then you can tie that to an emotion itself.

8. The ability to get to an emotion to present itself through a sound cue or other sense, is a powerful thing. Now emotions are tied to many things, so you've created a window of opportunity to tie that sound cue to multiple parts of the brain.

9. Once that cue is in the brain and your brain fires a synapse, then you can start to stress that part of the brain repeatedly. You can then tie it to another part of the brain that holds a different memory with that same emotion so long as you can make the connection between the two.

Here is where I am at currently.

10. If you tie a cue to an emotion, an emotion to another emotion, and then make those connections. What happens when you start to play with that connection? If you increase the frequency of the cue, or speed, will the synapse fire differently. The answer is yes. Then you take the pitch of that sound and move that around in order to create "higher" or "lower" connections in the brain.

11. You can start to tie cues to different aspects of human nature once you reach a high enough frequency. I'm going to use sound for the next example, because sounds frequency can be fired more than smell or taste or the other senses.

Currently, I have found wires in the ceiling of my grandparents house. Where I lived previously, I had started to become targeted and thought I needed to move. When I got to my grandparents, I saw the same thing happening. They were using the same words and phrases, they were constantly watching me.

12. For example, take bird calls or bird chirps. You tie those to an emotional state. We'll call it pattern 1. That pattern becomes stronger the more the chirps are reinforced and the more you can call back to that pattern with those chirping noises. Then, you increase the frequency or speed of them. Then you increase or decrease the pitch depending on which part of the brain you are trying to target.

13. It's one thing to tie a sound to an emotion. But what if you tie a sound to an emotion to a smell and you tie the original emotion to your biological clock.

So it looks something like this

Sound to emotion
That sound > second emotion > a smell
That original emotion > series of emotions > and once you have those series of emotions you can tie them to something like motor skill since your body will have generally the same response to similar emotions.

So the pattern is
1. Sound > second emotion > smell
2. Emotion> series of emotions > motor skill
So the final output is 
3. Smell > motorskill 

14.
When you amp up or decrease sound that is tied to a motorskill, then you have a window of opportunity into almost anything in the body. The reason for this is because you can then tie back that biological function to more words. When you get someone repeating a pattern enough and focused enough on the environment, you are then able to get that person to follow almost anything you do.

The wires in my family's home have been transmitting a higher and higher pitched frequency. I mean literal wires put in the house in order to target me. I believe it's because I stumbled into a place where a group of people who I'll call "Their Family" works. I say that because they call each other by brother and sister, they have birthdays and they communicate like a family would , with their own language.

From what I know, they're involved in many different aspects of crime. Drugs, prostitution, laundering, murder, extortion, etc. 

15. 
With your words, senses, memories, motorskills all tied to something else, then you can start to manipulate their body. The reason I bring up this "family" is because they share these insights with each other. They pass around cues for people and do their best to manipulate and control people. This isn't something that a single person can do on their own, they need more than one in order to make sure that every aspect of the body can be tied down. Remember those 7 patterns I brought up? Well they try and take up as much of that space as possible. So it's not like one part of your daily routine is messed up and you can move on, they will find every aspect of you and keep you where they want you.

16.
From what I've gathered, there are multiple ways to kill someone with this. Im going to share two that I know I'm being targeted with, although there are more.

1. 
The first is causing someone to have their eyes and brain become incredibly sensitive to light. I know of this one because I have unknowingly been through this before which is why I am able to put together so much and see what is happening.

2.
The second is heart attack. If you have the ability to control motorskills then you have the ability to constrict or expand blood vessels. If you have the ability to constrict or expand vessels, then you can move energy throughout the brain, and this includes the ability of tying new thoughts and memories together.

17.
The ability to move things around in the body, that is the primary thing they are after. What they mostly need is a cypher, or more fittingly a one way cypher.
You tie words to words, and you mix all their words up so that you can understand what they're saying but they can't. Similar to how a child gets parented.

18
The way they start is with, "who, what, when, where, why, how, how come"

19
You can tie a question like "when are you going" to "what are you doing", and if it's a question you ask out of nowhere and you expect their response "going where?" Then you tie the word "where" to something like "who"

20
So you have them essentially saying "doing who?" And then you go on with the pattern like that with their words. You obscure the words through whispers, making their ears sensitive to sound, and if the pattern starts to become really engrained then you can make them hear their own words in the environment which can slow or speed their movement. You can also tie hearing their words in the environment to something like sensitivity to light or muscles that control blood flow.

21
Then there is a feedback loop with having someone hear themselves in the environment.
If you have someone get used to hearing themselves in other people's speech, if you have a group of people, then you can rotate those words around their head in varying levels of volume. That is one way to obscure.

In my personal experience, the wires in the house are part of my feedback loop. When you have a high enough frequency then the frequency gets transmitted through the metal framing. Any sound you associate with a certain level of frequency, becomes another layer of the pattern. So you can whisper words underneath other words in order to get someone to fire two different parts of the brain at the same time.
