My name is Kyle. I woke up this morning in the wrong place. Nothing feels quite right. This world looks like mine, in many ways, but it's not. I don't know who to call and I don't know who can help. If anybody reads this, please, get me out. Please let me out.

I woke up this morning like normal, rolled out of bed to let out the new puppy out the back. He's been sleeping through the night, thankfully. I can't say that about my restless night. I tossed and turned for hours, never getting more than 15 minutes of actual rest. I'm tired as hell now and I don't think that will get any better in the short term. After letting him do his business, he ran back inside to eat, then laid down with one of his toys. I began my morning ritual of getting my coffee fix. Ten steps to the kitchen, turn left, open the 3rd cabinet from middle. Grab a mug, open the pouch of grounds, pour them in til they reach the 3rd line. Fill up the water, place the mug underneath, then we're off to the races. My parents always said I had OCD, but it's never really bothered me. I can remember things well when it's something I do daily. Just like every night it's; up from the couch, 20 paces to the door, turn the deadbolt back and forth, 3 times, then jiggle the doorknob left and right, 3 times. They think it's some mental illness, I just think it's a good routine.

Jokes aside, I know it's probably something like OCD but I've never been fully evaluated. It doesn't affect me or my relationships, as far as I can tell. It's tiring at times, but leaving the norm usually makes days worse. I like that way my life is set up. That's why this morning was so irritating. Ten steps to the kitchen, turn left... wall. There's no wall there. I look right, 3rd cabinet from the middle. I walk over and open it to find tea bags and small glass cups. No coffee pouches in site, nor any of my mugs. I was sent reeling, opening the rest of the cupboards to check on their status. Plastic plates with fine silverware stuffed not so neatly in the wrong places. Mixing bowls thrown haphazardly into places they don't belong, with other utensils sitting inside them. No rhyme or reason, no plan or design, and absolutely not my kitchen. I began to lose it when the sound of banging on my front door snapped me out of it. I walked calmly over to find the door unlocked already. "*That's not my door."* I opened it to find a man standing there, looking oddly familiar, besides the lack of eyes and hair.

  
"Oh good, you're okay! Okay you're fine. You had me worried. You haven't missed my text since three years ago. That stomach bug almost did you in. Are you ok? What's going on? I texted you but you didn't reply. It's been almost three years since you've done that. Remember when you had that stomach bug? Are you ok?"


Hearing it speak, I realized it was supposed to be my best friend, Ryan. I've been friends with Ryan for most of my life, and I would get a text from him every morning asking for my breakfast order before work. He's my neighbor, works at a bakery and knows my routine, so it's not surprising that he showed up like he did. With the way I slept last night, I must've missed grabbing my phone from the side table. I assured him I was fine and grabbed the toasted bagel with chive cream cheese from him. It was my order every morning. He laughed it off and asked if I'd be alright now, to which I didn't reply. He looked hesitantly at me and asked again. I caught myself just staring at him, but eventually told him I was fine and I needed to get a shower. He shrugged it off and said goodbye, then turned to go about his day. I slowly closed the door, and turned the deadbolt. Back and forth, three times. I quickly crept over to the window and pulled the curtains closed, but kept a small crack to watch where Ryan went. He walked out to the sidewalk and stood there, facing the street. Slowly, he turned left and started a dead sprint down the road. There's no way he could have known where he was going.



I stood there in disbelief for a moment. Before I could collect my thoughts, another banging started, this time at my basement door. It isn't a basement, per se, but more of a dark cellar used to house the HVAC and plumbing. The banging didn't stop for a full 5 minutes. I watched the clock. At that point, I had had enough, so I walked over to the door. As soon as I was 3 steps away, it stopped. I heard a slight whimpering on the other side, like a puppy. My puppy. I stepped back and peered around the hallway corner to see my puppy inside his open crate in the corner of the room. The banging started up again until I moved back, 3 steps away. This time, the whimpering was still there, but it had also been joined by a slight whispering. I couldn't make out what it was saying from where I was standing. I inched myself closer to the door, and as I did, the whispering grew louder. It was whispering, then talking, then as I got within a foot of it, the voice was screaming.



"LET ME OUT. LET ME OUT. LET ME OUT. LET ME OUT." Over and over again. I backed away but it didn't subside. Instead, it started banging the door violently in between in phrase. I could hear the doorknob rattle and the hinges creak as it was happening. I turned away, ran over to the dog and grabbed him up, then ran into my room. I've been here since. It's been 53 minutes (will be longer before I post this) and it hasn't stopped. I'm wearing headphones to help drown it out. I swear I can hear it through my vents too, and about 2 hours and 4 minutes ago, I started to hear a scratching. Since then, I've determined that it's coming from below me, under the floorboards, like someone is trying to chisel their way through it with their fingernails. I've checked my phone a few times and I can't text or call. Services seems to only be working one-way, because I am receiving them. I've gotten exactly one text since the banging started, from Ryan. It reads, "Hey buddy! You should do as you're told."
