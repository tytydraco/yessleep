“Listen up, we are going to split into groups of three.” Sheriff Jenkins yelled. It was weird seeing him sober and, well, actually doing his job. There were less than 3000 people in this town, so there was not a long going on. Usually. However, this evening was different. He split several groups before turning to me.



“Will, you are going with Leo and…” I caught a glimpse of her with peripheral vision. Please not her. Just not her. “...Charlotte.”



I could feel her eyes turning to me, but I couldn’t bring myself to look back at her. I haven’t seen her in four years, not since…



“Alright shall we?” The old man proclaimed. I looked at Leo and nodded as she approached from our side. 



“Hi Leo. Will.” I couldn’t bring myself to even nod at her. I wanted to say so much, but words could not escape my throat, as if they were grappled by hooks. It didn’t matter, I wasn’t able to say much here anyway, “Let’s start by the lake, I heard several other groups will start on the other side, near the quarry and old road.” Charlotte suggested. 



“Alrighty, let’s go kids.” Leo proclaimed, completely oblivious to the tension between us which felt as if it could be cut with a knife. 



Leo led, and two of us followed. We slowly left the mob that was rounded up in front of the police station, each group of three going their way. 



Jane, daughter of the local clergy, did not come back from school this morning. By the afternoon her parents were already worried, as she was not answering her phone. I found it a little weird that a 9 year old girl had a phone, but that seemed irrelevant now.



Unlike modern myth, where it’s presumed that 24 hours have to pass before a person is declared missing, Sheriff Jenkins and Jane’s parents wasted no time. It was nearly dusk on the same day before everybody able was rounded up to create the search parties. Other than a flat meadow right beside the lake, the town was surrounded by thick evergreen forest. This will be no easy search.



Cold, fresh air by the lake was slowly replaced by earthy smell enhanced by damp leaves below our feet as we entered the forest, suddenly becoming much darker than it was supposed to be during this time of the day, making us fire up the flashlights. Shivers ran through my spine, not because of the cold air, but because I was reminded. The last time I was in the forest was 4 years ago. With Charlotte. 

  
  


Slowly, we walked through the forest, beams of flashlights grimly illuminating dense trees, disappearing in the far darkness, that made me feel as if we were being watched. I did not want to be here by any means, but small towns make people feel closer than they would in big cities. I felt an obligation to help, as if my own family member was missing, which in a sense, was.



Leo went in front shouting Jane’s name, and once he was several feet away from us, Charlotte leaned towards me and whispered : 



“Do you think…”



“No.”



“You didn’t even let me...”



“I don’t have to. No. We are not going there.”



“It would be the perfect place for a kid to hide, or whoever possibly kidnapped…” she went silent as Leo stopped in his tracks.



“What are you kids yapping about?”



“Oh, nothing, I was just asking Charlotte how her family business is going.”



“Ah, yes, good. It is good to make small talk in situations like these. Makes us feel less scared.” Leo replied, half absent, still looking around, waddling with fleshlight. “Well go on Charlotte, I heard your father had a real lucky break there.”



I could feel her cold stare, but she turned to Leo after a few moments, following my game.



“Yes uncle Leo.” Everybody knew everybody in our town. It was not weird to call anybody older an uncle or aunt. As I said, family. “They were just trying to drill a well, and they thought the machine broke when black liquid started spilling. We could not believe it was actually oil.” 



“Good, good. I am glad for your family Charlotte, that is big and serious business. But I know you and your family will be smart about it.”  
  


“Oh we are. And I am.” she smiled at Leo, as if there was a joke there only she understood. 



“Enough of that though, let’s find little Jane.” she said after a while, pulling me back into the moment, remembering the very reason why we were here out in the dark.



This time, Charlotte led the way. Leo turned to me to talk about his chickens and his bowel movements, I think, as I didn’t really listen to him. Something was familiar in the way Charlotte was leading us, and pretty soon my suspicions were confirmed. We were heading right there, where it happened, and I couldn’t say a word in front of Leo. It would be too suspicious.



“Hm, what is this?” Charlotte asked when we reached a familiar mound. A few feet tall, it stood up against the flat ground of the forest, one of the only places in the forest that was not clouded by heavy treetops, allowing it to breathe in the purple dusk sky above. “Wait, there are traces of the steps here.”



So far I was anxious and annoyed, and suddenly pure fear surged through me. She was right, there were traces of steps around the mound, and they led right to the entrance. We exchanged looks of fear and confusion, while Leo followed the steps, finding otherwise nearly impossible-to-see hatch. The round door on the side of the mound, camouflaged with moss, opened with a heavy creek. He turned to us, confused even more.



“What is this?”



As if we practiced we just shrugged in confusion, pretending we did not know it existed.



“I don’t know, but she might be in here.” Charlotte said.



Leo yelled Jane’s name several times into the hatch. No answer.



“We should get back and find help.” I said.



As Charlotte opened her mouth, Leo cut her off.



“She might be in there. Hurt too. Seconds could be crucial.” 



God. Damn. It. Traces of steps were there so he was most likely right. If we went back now, it would probably be difficult to find a mound again, in the middle of the forest, during the night. Although we found it easy this time. Perhaps too easy.



Two of us followed Leo, which I was glad to do, because he could not see blood drain from my face and my hands shaking, as we entered a narrow passageway, hunched down so we do not scrape the ceiling with the top of our heads. When we did not yell for Jane, I could hear echo of my own breathing, wondering if it’s as loud as it sounds. Probably more. I could pass it off as being scared, as I didn’t know what this bunker even served for. Which I truly, I did not. Last time we tried exploring we did not come far or stayed too long.



My gut was sinking as we approached the end of the tight hallway, which widened into a sizable room, filled with desolate lockers and benches that looked pre world-war-2. A room where it all happened. 



As we entered, I flickered fleshlight to the right, hoping by some miracle I won’t see him. A miracle did not come. 



A rotted skeleton lay on the floor, still in the jeans and yellow jacket he wore when we killed him. When Charlotte killed him. It was supposed to be a small argument, when they ironically argued if we should let our elders know about this weird place we randomly found on our hike. Charlotte pushed him just a bit too hard in anger, and he stumbled, hitting the sharp edge of the bench with the temple of his head. He did not move after falling, and he did not move ever again.



We agreed to not speak with anyone about it, claiming we did not see Alex that day, and forming a search party back then just as we did today. I remember the weight of hiding the secret from Alex’s mom, which almost made me want to confess, just so she could have some closure. Charlotte convinced me not to do it then, and up to this day we did not talk, not just about that day, but about anything at all. 



A beam of flashlight caught something else, something dark, a line. I followed the line for a moment before realizing what it was. Blood. A few feet away from Alex's skeleton, little Jane lay motionless against the wall, an obvious bullet hole in the middle of her forehead.



Before I could scream, a loud sound echoed behind me, making me jump, and I turned around to see Leo falling, dead before even hitting the ground. Charlotte turned her still smoking gun towards me.



“WHAT THE FUCK?” I yelled at her.



“Sorry Will. I am sorry about them too, but it had to be done.”

“But, but...why?”



“You heard me talking to Leo. We struck gold with oil at our ranch, and we are about to become rich beyond comprehension. We’ll be under the scope soon, and the smallest rumor could be the end of us, such as, you know…” she said pointing at Alex’s skeleton.



Charlotte always had narcissistic manners, thinking just about her and protecting her own interests. I did not think she was capable of premeditated murder though.



“Killing one person is worse than killing three? One of them being A FUCKING KID?” I pointed at Jane, still struggling to come to the reality of the situation. A single tear ran over my cheek. 



“Not if there are no witnesses. I heard you that day when it happened with Alex, when you almost spilled everything. But no bodies, no murder, nobody can be blamed. I am sorry about little Jane and Leo, but I’ll just say I got separated from the two of you..” She cocked her gun, pointing at my forehead.  



“Wait, wait!” I yelled, trying to buy myself some time in desperation. “How did you know it would be exactly us coming here? Jenkins could have paired you with anyone.”



“He is paid too, and he too will be dead in some time. Can’t trust a drunkard. Goodbye Will.”



I did not hear a gunshot, just the bright flash aimed at my head.
