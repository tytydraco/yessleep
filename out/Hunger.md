It has been exactly  7 days since my orange tabby Clementine has been missing, sighing, I close my front door and put down the staple gun from when I was putting up missing flyer's. Plopping down my bed, I cried myself to sleep, wondering if he'll ever come home again and what happened to him...

Waking up from my hunger, I groggily went to the kitchen. My other cat, Sadie, watches me from her cat tower as i pass by like a zombie. Of course not forgetting to greet and pet her fluffy head as I turn to the corner, into the kitchen. After finishing my quick meal, I put the dirty dish into the sink. My stomach starts hurting, a starving sensation I can't shake off. For almost 2 weeks I've been experiencing this, feels like everyday it's just getting worst and worst, like my stomach is about to burst open. It has gotten to the point ive collapse and lose consciousness, Ive gone to the Doctor but they said nothing was wrong... how can nothing be wrong when how much I eat nothing seems to get rid of this hunger. 

Feeling hopeless I lay down on the cold kitchen floor, shutting my eyes close and wrapping my arms around my stomach as the feeling gets worst, and worst. Opening my eyes, due to the throbbing headache, I lose Orientation as I start to slowly black out, but from afar I could tell Sadie was coming over with something in her mouth. Before she could reach me I fully lose consciousness.

Slowly waking up from Sadie's meows and walking over me, I put myself back together as I held my still throbbing head. Standing up, from the clock I saw it was already the next day. Sighing, I was about to walk out of the kitchen when I stepped on something. Screaming in agony, I looked down at what I stepped in, shards of the broken plate I used yesterday. Fuck, I hopped over the the bathroom just in front of the kitchen and cleaned my foot up and wrapped gauze around it. Going back in the kitchen, I cleaned up the rest of the broken plates. While I was silently cleaning, I smelled something weird, like something died. Looking around the kitchen floor, I couldn't find anything, but then I spot the trashcan hidden in the corner with all the garbage digged up everywhere and flies flying around it. On closer look, I realize there were rats half bitten and rotting away near the trashcan. I gagged and gave Sadie a deathstare as she continued to lick herself all pompous on the counter. 

Fatigued, I went back to bed, as I was laying and getting comfortable the feeling came back again. Uncontrollable aching, it's getting so annoying. I hate it. Forcing myself to sleep and bear the pain... but not a few seconds later, I feel myself going insane at how painful it was getting. Rushing into the kitchen, I grabbed anything I could eat. Bread, left overs, frozen beacon, raw chicken, anything. Shaking from the never ending hunger, I cried and sobbed on the floor, I just want it to end. As I was laying hopeless on the kitchen floor again, I see Sadie coming up to me again, this time dragging something bigger. A raccoon...? A dead raccoon. Looking into Sadie's eyes, it felt welcoming and yet so dark, I refused. Shutting my eyes tightly and Biting my lips, I pray for it to end. But it'll never will, something in my mind said. The hopelessness overcomes me and I reached for the dead raccoon. Sinking my teeth into it, ripping it apart as I eat it inside and out. Suddenly my hunger goes away... suddenly I feel nothingness as I come to my senses. I ate a dead raccoon...

It's been who knows how long at this point, I refuse to look at the clock or do anything other than be on this cold kitchen floor with only Sadie to accompany me and the meals she brings me. A knock on the door spooks Sadie, she hisses as someone calls out for me from outside. Who could it be? The slow creeking of the door and the voice getting cleaner tells me they came in. Turning around the corner into the Kitchen, a see an old woman, my neighbour, look at me in shock and horror. A dirty, smelly, fly infested, half dead, bony, hollow shell that I was once before.

Seeing her suddenly made me hungry again... for the first time in days that I've been glued to this floor, I crawled towards her as she gets on her knees to help me. God, I'm starving.
