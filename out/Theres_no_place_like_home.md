The air was humid the night it all began- It sat  heavy and stagnant, just as my inevitable fate lie ahead…

I remember mosquitos nibbling on my calves as I unlocked the door to my apartment. After fumbling with my keys in the dark, I exhaled with relief as I entered my living room.

A pair of eyes shined in the dark, and as I flipped on the light, my cat, Ollie stood squinting and meowing at me.

After loving on him, and showering, I finally sat down to eat dinner and watch something.

I turned on The Wizard of Oz and twirled my Ramen noodles, sinking into the sofa.

It was my mom’s favorite movie growing up, and has become sort of a comfort for me.

I smiled as the familiar black and white introduction to the film began.

That’s when I heard it… a knock at my door.

I tapped my phone screen and my stomach dropped - 12:16 AM.

Who could possibly be at my door at this time?

My family lived states away, I’ve been single since my ex cheated on me 6 months ago, and all the mean girls had iced me out at work.. I had no one.

Except Ollie.

As my eyes met his, we both jumped as we heard the knock again.

Suddenly, I heard a familiar voice -

“Brittney sweetie, it’s me- mom! Let me in!”

I felt puzzled…

First off, “sweetie” was not a part of my mom’s typical vocabulary.

Secondly, she was 2 plane rides and 17 hours of driving away… We spoke every day and surely she would have mentioned an impromptu trip?

I looked over at Ollie, and his wirey fur validated my unease.

I finally (reluctantly) decided to look through the dreaded peep hole. I tip toed to the door, slowly raising myself up.

It was… my mom?

I mean, it looked like my mom, but my gut screamed the opposite.

The woman who claimed to be my mother was now further away from the door, staring straight ahead, with a scowl on her face.

“Brittney I am your mother! You better open this door for me NOW!”

Palms sweating, I cleared my dry throat and finally broke the silence.

“Mom?” I quavered, “what are you doing here?”

Her response was quick, and had more of a natural cadence now-

“Well obviously I came to surprise you! Now you’re really starting to upset me - let me inside, you’re being rude!”

As I reached to open the door, my mind scrambled- my brain battled my gut.

My intuition took the lead and brought me to only one logical solution- calling my mother.

Maybe I was being paranoid, maybe I would hear her phone ring on the other side of the door- and if I didn’t, it would confirm that this person outside was indeed an imposter.

I’m not sure what I was thinking to be honest, but I know my gut rarely failed me.

To stall, I told the woman,

“Okay, I’m sorry mom! Just- give me a second, I’m getting dressed… just got out of the shower.”

Nothing but silence in response.

I called my mom’s cellphone- no answer.

I looked through the peephole, holding my breath…She was smiling?

A big, toothy grin- except it didn’t look happy- and she definitely didn’t look like she was getting a phone call.

I called my mom again. And again. And again.

Finally, she answered. Clearly I woke her up from her slumber.

The thing outside remained frozen, with that disturbing grin sprawled across its face.

My real mom’s voice was a hug dipped in honey, in comparison- it jolted me out of my thoughts.

“Brittney what in the world is going on? Are you okay? What’s wrong?”

I was so terrified I could barely speak,

“Mom… where are you?”

The silence of her thoughts lingered too long.

“Mom!”

She interrupted my panic.

“I’m home, I’m home. What are you talking about? What is going on? Brittney? Brittney? Hello?”

I heard the voice on the other side of the door begin to mimic my real mother’s words…

“I’m home, I’m home, there’s no place like home.”

How did this thing look just like my mom?

How did it copy her voice?

Suddenly, as if a premonition, I heard the phrase again-

“There’s no place like home!”

This time, it was the voice of Judy Garland - the movie was nearing its end.

My insides knotted at the synchronicity of the words, as they remained floating in the air.

The imposter unleashed a manic laughter that made my skin crawl.

I could still hear my real mother continue to yell my name in the background.

Soon her voice was muffled, and soon I couldn’t hear anything at all.

Sweat drenched me, as my vision blurred , heart raced, and my world went mute.

A panic attack? Now? 

Dear God please let some sort of fight or flight kick in.

Before I could even finish the plea in my head, Ollie landed in my lap, breaking my state.

I thanked the lord, grabbed my phone, my cat, and locked myself in the bathroom.

I looked down and was confused when I saw my mother had ended the call…

You’d think she’d be concerned enough to stay on the line.. but maybe she fell back asleep?

I forced myself to focus and call 911. I texted my mom, explaining what happened, so she wouldn’t be too worried. She hasn’t read it yet, so I’m guessing she’s still asleep?

I found it hard to believe she’d simply fall back asleep if she knew her daughter was in some sort of trouble, but I couldn’t worry about that now-

The knocking slowly progressed to banging, scratching, and something else I can’t quite place- a clicking noise maybe?

The racket  grew louder every minute.

Finally, it grew so loud I could hardly stand it anymore.

I pushed my fingers into my ears and closed my eyes, trying to breathe.

Ollie, my solace, climbed into my lap, attempting to calm me with his deep purrs.

It felt like I sat on that floor for hours. If it weren’t for my furry companion, the panic attack would have won in a heartbeat.

Finally a man’s voice bellowed the word I’d been longing to hear:

“Police!”

After shakily letting them in, the cops did a “thourough” sweep through the inside and outside of the apartment.

Nobody was there.

I felt (and looked) delusional. I apologized profusely for the inconvenience- my trauma, the inconvenience.

Life continued on, as it does and I did start to convince myself it was all a dream..

I readjusted to my mundane routine.

After work, I hesitantly put Dorothy back on my screen- A weird nightmare wasn’t going to ruin my comfort movie.

Everything was normal for a week or so… until one night, I heard a knock at my door. I looked at the clock - “12:16 AM.”

Ollie looked at me, knowingly - fur wirey again.

My first instinct was to again, call my mom… I picked up my phone, and went to my recent call history- We had chatted this morning about the new Lavender Starbucks drink.

I clicked my mom’s contact, but the line didn’t even ring… just a robotic melody and an animated woman saying,

“This number has been disconnected.”

Disconnected?

How?

Not possible.

I literally just talked to her a couple of hours ago.

The knocking continued, causing my chest to tighten.

I hadn’t talked to my sister in a few months, but she lived closer to mom, so I figured I’d give her a call- at least I knew she’d be awake.

The knocking on the door grew louder, but clearly whatever it was couldn’t come in unless I let it in.

Right?

When I finally got ahold of my sister, I projectiled the entire story, frantically, over the line.

She seemed confused.

“Britt, what the hell are you talking about? Are you actually okay? Kinda sounds like you’re having a menty-b..”

The knocking grew so loud I could barely stand it.

I thought my ears may start to bleed, my blood boiled.

I knew I must have sounded crazy but I rushed through the series of events and asked again,

“Why is mom’s number disconnected?”

Silence.

Again, a silence that lingered too long.

“Britt,”

she paused, as if waiting for me to remember something.

“Britt… Mom passed 6 years ago… You know this. Seriously are you okay? I know grief is hard, I think you should talk to somebody-”

Her voice trailed off as I hung up the phone in disbelief.

The silence screamed.

The knocking had stopped.

Relief never came however, because  following the silence, was my previously locked doorknob, turning.

As years of memories swirled around me, flooding my reality, my blood froze at the sound of an unnaturally chipper voice,

“Brittney it’s mom! I’m home! I’m home! It’s time to come home.”

I heard the stranger’s heels click three times- A hasty warning as the door swung open violently.

I instinctively ran and hid underneath my dusty bed, but I knew she saw me. I knew it was only a matter of time.

As expected, I was left alone with my labored breathing for only a moment- cut off by frigid breath on the back of my neck, and a whisper far too close for comfort or escape.

I was no longer alone, no longer in “hiding.”

How ironic that the words that comforted me for so many years, may be the last words I ever heard…

The creature that once disguised itself as my mother was no longer recognizable.

As I fell out of consciousness, the beasts’ words mocked me, pulling me in with a satisfied smile, and the lingering words…

“There’s no place like home.”
