 Well, now I have to wash my face a bit, shave my cheek, maybe some woman will get involved, sniff my shirt to see if I can still put it on, behind me there's a fridge, and in that fridge, there's vodka, vodka, vodka.

A bottle and silesian sausage from the butcher's to a canvas bag, and I fly. The journey passed without any major adventures, apart from being splashed by a puddle by a passing Polonez car and a tramp in an articulated Ikarus (a bus poduced in Hungary), whose presence pushed the rest of the passengers to the opposite side of the vehicle, disturbing the center of gravity of the machine calculated by the Magyar designers. Then just a quick jog, 2nd lane to the left, first in the row, Marcin's, but he's not here now, then 3rd to the right and 2nd in the row, this one is from Gienek, but he won't be here today either, and from this point the 4th turn, there it is - Zbyszek's dream plot. On the plot there is Zbyszek himself with a big mustache, Marcin with a big nose and Gienek with a big belly. "Aloha, guys!" – I shouted, happily shaking the bottle, “and who is this kid  hanging around here?” – I looked from the little one to Gienek. “Well, the old lady told me to take Łukasz with me, after I solemnly assured her that I was only going to water the vegetables, no drinking, hehe”.

 

The party with sausages from the fire was going on until the bushes called me to them, toss my cookies, and finally the floor is mine. I wake up at night in the gazebo, I still have to piss, I stagger far far away to the bushes. I pass Zbyszek, who is also moving with the same step of a wanker-wasting-man and I must be hallucinating, because it seems to me as if his mustache has fallen off, and yet he still had it a moment ago. I do my thing, I go back to my place and look in surprise at the floor, after all it was wooden, what is the carpet doing here? Never mind, the booze has got the better of me, I go back to sleep.

 

No, I don't believe it, it's pressing again, I get up, oh, my back, my legs, how did I have to sleep that it hurts so much now? I go to the known place, and here Zbyszek and Gienek at the table are beating another round. "Oh, I thought you had enough for today" - I asked - "and where is Marcin? Did he go home?". They only responded with surprised looks, so I waved my hand and went into the bushes, coming back I looked at them, Zbyszek still without a mustache, but Gienek suddenly bald, only now did I see the third participant of the feast - a human skeleton, raising a glass with a bony paw and digging his empty eye sockets into me. And hallucinations, I'm afraid, I have to stop drinking, I fell over.

 

I woke up again, feeling something running down my face, a light rain was coming in through a hole in the roof, the inside of the gazebo stank, the furniture seemed to be falling apart. I got up with great difficulty to go outside, I didn't recognize the area, just a long lawn, no vegetables, no "my" bushes. "Mr. Mociński, Mr. Mociński" - I suddenly hear from the side - "you can't sleep here, I've told you a hundred times, I'll take you home". I look at the stranger, his face seems familiar, it's Łukasz, but how on earth? He should be a child, but in front of me stands a grown man. I collapse again.

 

I have to get out of here, I know the way from the gate well, I'll retrace my steps. Then just a quick jog, but with a cane, 2nd alley to the left, first in the row, Marcin's, but he's not here anymore, then 3rd to the right and 2nd in the row, this one is from Gienek, but he won't be here either, and from this point 4th turn, there it is - Zbyszek's gravestone decorated with a cross.
