First off, my house isn't that big. From the outside, you'd see a pretty average size two-story house.

It's not the biggest house on the block, but it's where me, my wife, and our dog call home. Two bedroom, two bathroom, and a basement.

Occasionally, I'll notice some strange noises coming from the basement but I usually figure it's just some animal scratching on the walls outside or something.

Lately, however, the noises have been getting louder and more frequent. It's gotten to the point where we can't ignore it anymore.

Honestly, we don't usually go in the basement that much, it's mostly served as storage for all our crap. Going downstairs, you'd find stacks of boxes, kayaks, old furniture, stuff like that. 

Tonight, we were sitting in the living room downstairs, when we heard a loud thud from down in the basement. We paused the TV, and looked at each other.

"What the fuck was that?" She asked,

"I don't know, maybe something fell over?" I responded.

We got up and walked over to the basement door. She was too creeped out to go, so I stepped down while she kept guard upstairs.

I can't really blame her, seeing pitch black leading downstairs was enough to send shivers down my spine. But I got down there and turned on the light.

The basement wasn't lit up entirely well, some of the light bulbs obviously needed to be replaced and it didn't cover nearly everything so I had to resort to the flashlight on my phone as well.

I was walking around, realizing how desperately we needed to organize and dust down here, when a shadow darted in front of me and knocked something over. Far too quick for me to make anything out.

"Jesus fuck!" I exclaimed.

"Are you okay?!" She yelled down.

"Yeah, I'm fine. I think there's an animal down here." I responded.

"Are you serious? Get back up here, and shut the door! I don't want you to get rabies or something." She said.

Right after that, I heard a door click shut in front of me. I looked over to the far side of the wall.

There were multiple stacks of boxes that blocked the majority of the wall, but behind that I could barely make out the sight of paneling and some windows.

I walked closer, there was definitely something here that wasn't the same concrete wall that was there before. Once I pushed some boxes out of the way, there was no mistaking it.

This was the front of a house. A black door, one window on both sides and white wooden paneling.

"Come down here, you have to see this." I yelled up at her.

We were both standing in front of this new discovery in absolute awe. After some initial shock, we were discussing how something like this could've possibly showed up, when we had never seen it before.

"This is creepy as hell. We should go." She said to me.

"Wait a sec, I'm gonna open the door." I replied.

"Fuck that, I wanna leave now. Let's go stay at my parents. I've listened to enough paranormal stories to know this can't be good. Plus there might be a coyote or raccoon in here right now." She stammered.

"Oh please, I doubt there's anything supernatural here. This is where the concrete wall starts." I said, opening the door.

Just to suddenly realize how wrong I was. When the door was fully open and we looked inside, we saw a fully furnished living room.

The best way I could describe the appearance of this room would be a 50s aesthetic. Not only that, it honestly looked warm and cozy inside.

When we stepped inside, I can't explain just how comfortable we felt. This overwhelming sensation of belonging and security washed over us.

If it wasn't for the fact that we both knew just how bizarre this was, we might have wanted to stay in there. That feeling we suddenly had was taken over by our grounded sense of reality.

This was wrong, and we both knew it. This room shouldn't be here. But it doesn't end here, there's two separate hallways that look like they lead even further in.

Not only that, I could see a door that was open and led even further down. There are more levels to this area.

"Can we please leave, this doesn't feel safe at all. Please." She begged me.

"What? Come on, we should explore this some more. It's not often that your house gets extra square footage!" I said, being the enabler I was.

She was reluctant, but I could tell she wanted to look around just as much as me. And we might've too, if we didn't hear something coming up from the stairs below.

Something was sprinting up towards us, barreling and crashing into the walls as they did. Right at that moment, I didn't want to take any chances with whatever might be lurking down here.

I grabbed her arm, and we bolted right out of there and ran right upstairs back to our living room. I slammed the basement door behind me, when I felt continuous bangs right behind me.

They were quick, and they just might've caught us if my reaction wasn't faster. Thank God me and her were able to run out to our car and get out of there without having to face whatever the fuck that was.

As I'm typing this out, we're in the guest room of her parents house and we're both really shaken up.

Does anyone know what we should do? I mean, we have to go back at some point. We can't just stay here forever.

Has anyone ever experienced something like this? Because I'm genuinely at a loss here, hoping someone can help us get our house back.

Fuck, I just realized our dog is still there...
