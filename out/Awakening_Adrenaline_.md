Awakening Adrenaline 



Have you ever wondered why it's a child's instinct to become afraid of the dark? Why adults sometimes wonder what's under their bed? You know what I mean - that creepy, crawling feeling when you get out of the car alone at night, and suddenly it slithers in. A feeling of a bit more weight around the edges of your consciousness. You see it from the inside; there's a shifting of the way your perception reads the moment. It's all pretending and fear, feeding itself one bite at a time. One moment you're singing happily in your car, the next you're scared shitless of imaginings inside your brain.

The man standing just out of your field of vision is staring and waiting. You see his black suit and feel the history of all the other children he's stared at. There's a memory of his ability to approach your personal space in the blink of an eye, rushing up into your face with a whoosh of gothic playfulness. It will burn into your memory so deeply that you'll never need to experience it again, and always remember the moment enough that it happens on its own inside your scared, mushy brain.

Now you're getting it - the fear experience is rolling in like fog. You begin to tell yourself you won't run, that it's just an imagining, stamping your foot trying to find reality. Oh, but no, it's winning. It starts at your knees, the weakness rolls up your body until it hits your heart. So strange because it's all in your head. The pressing is like a volume button stuck on high, and you can't change it. Rising and rising, icy and slithering, and completely in control of the station in your head that's irrational and animal. It says, "Run!" It says, "I'll get you!" It says, "I'm scaring you!" You respond with a remote moving of your limbs to get yourself to safety. Outside of yourself in your response, because no sane person would be controlled by something that wasn't real or tangible.

It's similar to a dog running so fast its ass is tucked under, and all four legs piston together. Your reality is closing in upon itself; you can't think anymore, just feeling - just feeling the icy fear that's reached the inside and back of your mind. RUN! Breath comes faster, and your mind is lost in the moment, no longer trying to trick yourself into thinking you were ever safe. You run into your home and slam the door. The warmth and safety of the couch and light welcome you. It fades - the fear - as if you just woke from a nightmare to find yourself in your comfortable, warm bed. What was I afraid of? It doesn't feel like a real thing so shortly after the assault of adrenaline.

From outside, there's a whisper that only her cells can hear: "I am not in your present, my dear. I am a twisted construct of childhood memories coagulated into a delicious feast for any passing, hungry fiend." "Until next time, sleep well."
