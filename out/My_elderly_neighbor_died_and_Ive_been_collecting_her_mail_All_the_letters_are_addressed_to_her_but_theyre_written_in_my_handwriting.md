Eleanor Vance was the perfect neighbor. She was 88, quiet, and kept a garden full of the most beautiful roses I’d ever seen. We had a simple, friendly relationship. I’d help her with her groceries, she’d give me a warm, crinkly smile and tell me stories about her late husband. When she passed away peacefully in her sleep last week, I was genuinely sad. Her only living relative, a niece in another state, asked if I’d mind collecting her mail until she could sort out the estate. Of course, I said yes.

The first few days, it was just junk mail and a few sympathy cards. But yesterday, a real letter arrived. It was a thick, cream-colored envelope, addressed to Eleanor in a familiar, messy cursive.

My cursive.

I dropped the rest of the mail on the floor. It was impossible, but there was no mistaking it. I’ve always hated my handwriting, the way my 't's never quite cross and my 's's look like a child’s. This was it. My hand, my penmanship. I thought it had to be a bizarre prank. Trembling, I opened it.

The letter was dated two days ago. It began, "Dear Eleanor, I had the strangest day."

It went on to describe my day, in my own internal voice, with perfect, impossible detail. It mentioned the frustrating meeting I had at work, the burnt coffee I made, the moment I almost called my ex but decided not to. It described the specific shade of the sunset I watched from my window. It was a diary entry of my own life, written by me, addressed to her. A diary entry I had never written.

I’ve been collecting her mail for a week now. There’s a new letter from me every single day. Each one details my life with a terrifying, intimate clarity. I’ve become a stranger to myself, my own actions narrated by a phantom scribe. My life is being documented by a hand I can’t control.

I haven't slept. I’ve been tearing my own apartment apart, looking for... I don't know what. A hidden camera? A journal I don't remember keeping? Nothing.

This morning, I used the emergency key Eleanor gave me to let myself into her apartment. I had to know. Her home was just as she’d left it, neat and smelling of lavender and old books. On the small writing desk in her living room, there was a single, sealed envelope.

It was different from the others. This one was addressed to me. And it was written in her elegant, shaky script.

My hands were slick with sweat as I opened it. The note inside was short.

"Dear Thomas,

Thank you for the stories. They were a great comfort in my final years. I'm so sorry, but the deal is the deal. It's your turn to listen now. He's very lonely, and he needs someone to talk to. Just be a good neighbor. That’s all there is to it.

Yours, Eleanor."

I dropped the letter. A deal? Listen to who?

That's when I heard it. From the corner of Eleanor's quiet, empty living room, a faint, dry whisper. It sounded like the rustling of old leaves. It was trying to form a word.

My word. My name.

And from my own pocket, my hand began to move on its own, reaching for a pen.
