The Woman at 3AM (True story – Miyerkules Santo, 2024)

It was Miyerkules Santo—Holy Wednesday. I don’t know what it is about Holy Week in the Philippines, but there’s a strange weight in the air. A kind of silence that feels... wrong. Not peaceful. More like something waiting.

The house felt normal that night. My room was locked, curtains drawn, electric fan humming. No bad energy. No horror movies. Just me, drained from the day, closing my eyes like I always do.

Then the dream came.

I was floating. Or maybe I was just standing still. It’s hard to explain, because the dream didn’t feel like a dream. I wasn’t in a place I recognized. It was just dark. Cold. And then, there were symbols. Strange, glowing characters hanging in the air in front of me. I couldn’t tell if they were numbers or letters, but I knew one thing for sure:

I couldn’t read them.

Not because they were foreign, but because it was like my brain had forgotten how to read at all. I stared harder, but the more I tried, the more my mind just blanked out. It felt... wrong. Like I wasn’t supposed to see them.

Then I woke up.

Or I thought I did.

I was aware. I could feel my blanket on my legs, the fan brushing cool air against my skin, my pillow under my head. I was fully conscious—but I couldn’t move.

Sleep paralysis.

I’ve had it before. I know the drill. Don’t panic, wait it out, it passes. That’s what I told myself.

But this time was different.

The air felt heavy, thick like smoke. I felt pressure on my chest—not physical weight, but like something was draining the oxygen out of the room. And deeper than that, I felt it.

A presence.

Something was in the room.

I fought to open my eyes. At first, nothing. Then, slowly, I managed to lift one eyelid just a crack.

And I saw it.

Light from the morning sun was leaking in through my curtains. But the light was dimming, flickering unnaturally. Like someone—or something—was standing over me.

It was a woman.

Long black hair. Pale skin. No clear face. Just standing there, inches from my face, leaning over me.

Watching.

My first instinct was to scream. I forced my throat to move. I could feel the tension in my neck, the strain in my jaw. I was screaming with everything I had.

But there was no sound.

Only silence.

And her.

I wanted to believe it was my sister. But my door was locked. It’s always locked when I sleep.

I started panicking. My heart was slamming in my chest. The worst part wasn’t that I couldn’t move—it was that I knew I was awake. I was seeing her while fully conscious.

I did the only thing I could do.

I focused on my fingers—just like I always do during sleep paralysis. I crawled them up my arm, inch by inch. It felt like moving through cement. Then I pinched myself—hard.

And suddenly—

I gasped. My lungs filled. I bolted upright.

The room was empty.

Door still locked. Curtains still closed. Fan still humming.

But I know what I saw.

That wasn’t a dream. That wasn’t my imagination. That wasn’t “just” sleep paralysis.

It was her.

And she was watching me.
