After the Necronomicon incident, the book was swiftly sealed away in a vault where Horus kept such dangerous artifacts. The black van sped away from the chaotic scene, leaving behind a trail of death and destruction. I barely registered the ride to the hospital, my thoughts clouded by the physical pain and the heavy weight of what I had just encountered.

The next few weeks were a blur of sterile hospital rooms, whispered conversations about my miraculous survival, and the lingering sting of cracked ribs and a fractured collarbone. Doctors prodded and poked, ensuring I hadn’t suffered any internal damage. As I lay in the hospital bed, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had been left unfinished, that the darkness I had fought was not entirely vanquished.

Eventually, I was cleared to leave, though the bruises and soreness served as constant reminders of my encounter with the Necronomicon. I was eager to get back to work, despite the warnings from my doctors. Small jobs began trickling in from Horus—mundane tasks that barely required my full attention. I was restless, craving something more significant, something that would challenge the skills I had honed over years of studying alchemy and the occult.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the world was bathed in the soft glow of twilight, I received a call from Horus. Another exorcism, they said, just another routine job. An old nun at a secluded convent had been possessed, and I was to handle it quickly and quietly. It seemed straightforward enough, the kind of job I could do in my sleep.

When I arrived at the convent, the atmosphere was thick with an unnatural stillness. The air was cold, biting, and the shadows seemed to stretch unnaturally long across the stone walls. The nun, Sister Agnes, was bound to her bed in a small, dimly lit room. Her frail body trembled under the weight of whatever malevolent force had taken hold of her. The candles flickered, casting eerie shadows that danced across her contorted face.

I prepared my tools—a collection of herbs, sigils, and alchemical concoctions—laying them out on a small wooden table beside her. The air grew heavier, and a sense of foreboding settled in my chest. As I began the exorcism, reciting the incantations that had been passed down through centuries of occult practice, the nun’s eyes snapped open. They were pitch black, voids of nothingness that seemed to swallow the light around them.

A low, guttural laugh echoed from her throat, a sound that reverberated off the stone walls and sent a shiver down my spine. It wasn’t Sister Agnes laughing—it was the demon within her, mocking me.

“Do you think you can banish me, little alchemist?” the voice rasped, dripping with malice.

I ignored the taunt, focusing on the ritual. But before I could finish the incantation, the nun’s body jerked violently, her muscles straining against the bindings. The laugh grew louder, more maniacal, as if the demon found my efforts amusing.

And then, in a moment of horrifying clarity, I felt it—a sudden, invisible force pulling tight, like a rope yanked taut. There was a sickening snap, and Sister Agnes’s head twisted sharply to the side, her neck broken in an instant. The life drained from her eyes, leaving only the hollow gaze of death. The room fell silent, save for the fading echo of the demon’s laughter as it departed from her lifeless body.

I stood there, frozen, the weight of what had just happened settling heavily on my shoulders. This was no ordinary demon, and this was no ordinary exorcism. Something dark and powerful had been at play, and it had just slipped through my fingers.

But as the nun’s broken body lay still, I couldn’t help but feel that this was only the beginning—a warning of something far more sinister lurking on the horizon. Little did I know that this seemingly insignificant job would tie into a much larger, darker tapestry of events, leading me deeper into the abyss than I had ever dared to venture.

The jobs I had undertaken for Horus had not only sharpened my skills but also significantly boosted my financial standing. The wealth I accumulated allowed me to procure more potent tools, rare herbs, tinctures, and a vast array of archaic books and manuscripts. I spent the next three months in intense study, my apartment gradually transforming into a cluttered sanctum of alchemical and occult knowledge. Yet, there was an unsettling calmness in those months. Horus had gone silent, and the air was thick with a sense of impending doom. I could feel it in my bones—something big was brewing.

Then, on a particularly frigid night, the call came. It was Horus, their usual stoic tone now tinged with urgency. Fifteen agents had been killed. The dread that settled over me was like a cold, unrelenting hand gripping my soul. Before I could even process the information, a black escort vehicle screeched to a halt outside my door. Within five minutes, I was speeding through the darkened streets of Elgin, the city I had thought I knew, my heart pounding in sync with the engine’s hum.

We pulled up to what appeared to be an unassuming metal storage building— the kind you’d expect to find filled with forgotten boats or dusty RVs. But as I approached the side door, an overwhelming stench hit me. The metallic tang of blood was so thick in the air that it triggered an immediate wave of nausea. My stomach churned as I stepped inside, my mind struggling to reconcile the normality of the building’s exterior with the carnage within.

The scene that greeted me was nothing short of a nightmare. Blood coated every surface—walls, floors, even the ceiling—and the mutilated bodies of fifteen agents lay scattered like broken dolls, their faces unrecognizable, their limbs twisted in grotesque angles. It was as if the room itself had been baptized in death. My heart raced, each beat hammering against my ribcage like a desperate, caged animal. The walls seemed to close in, suffocating me with the stench of death and despair.

And then I saw her.

In the center of the room, a little girl—no older than nine—floated inches above the ground. Her small hand was wrapped around the throat of a middle-aged woman, who I later learned was her mother. The child’s eyes were vacant, black voids that seemed to absorb all light. Her mouth was twisted into a grin, her laughter a symphony of dissonant voices, each one more twisted and malevolent than the last. As I took in the horrific scene, the girl’s head snapped toward me, her eyes locking onto mine with an unnatural intensity.

With a sickening crack, she snapped her mother’s neck with a flick of her wrist, the woman’s lifeless body crumpling to the blood-soaked floor. My heart skipped a beat, dread pooling in my gut like molten lead. Before I could react, the demon-possessed girl flung her arm in my direction with the same casual ease one might use to shoo away a fly. The force of her gesture sent me hurtling across the room. My body slammed into the ground with a bone-jarring thud, the impact driving blood into my mouth and eyes. The coppery taste mixed with the grime on the floor, the nauseating scent of iron and decay overwhelming my senses.

I tried to lift my head, to see her coming at me, but my body was paralyzed with pain. The girl moved with blinding speed, her small frame hovering inches above me, her presence radiating an oppressive, suffocating energy. She leaned down, her face inches from mine, and spoke in a voice that was a cacophony of screams and moans. The sound seemed to pierce through my skull, each word reverberating through my mind like a physical blow.

“I want my book back,” the demon hissed, her breath reeking of sulfur and decay.

I could barely move, barely think. Summoning what little strength I had left, I spat out a defiant, weak, “Fuck you.”

The demon’s response was immediate and brutal. With a swift, merciless motion, she brought her foot down on my lower back. The sound of my hip snapping was drowned out by my own scream, a raw, primal cry that tore through my throat. The pain was unlike anything I had ever experienced, a white-hot agony that obliterated all coherent thought. But the demon wasn’t done. She grabbed the front of my skull, her fingers digging into my flesh like burning iron.

As she delved into my mind, searching for any knowledge I might have of the Necronomicon, her touch burned like acid, searing my skin, my thoughts, my very soul. Every ward, every protective charm I had ever placed upon myself was rendered useless. This was a power unlike anything I had ever encountered—a force that scoffed at my alchemical defenses, that laughed in the face of my occult knowledge.

I didn’t know where Horus kept the Necronomicon, but the demon wasn’t fooled. She could see that I knew it was in their possession, and that knowledge was enough. I could feel her sifting through my memories, her grip tightening as she grew more impatient, more angry. My vision blurred as I struggled against her mental invasion, my thoughts becoming a jumbled mess of pain and fear.

The demon finally released the paralysis on me, her expression one of disgust and disdain. She looked at me, her black eyes burning with a hatred so intense it was almost palpable.

“You are pathetic and weak,” she snarled, her voice dripping with contempt. “Next time, be prepared, or I will start my reign of destruction by killing anyone you ever cared for.”

With a quick, vicious squeeze, she crushed my skull, the sickening crack echoing in my ears as darkness enveloped me. The last thing I heard before slipping into unconsciousness was her maniacal laughter, a sound that would haunt me even in the depths of my coma.

I awoke two months later in a hospital bed, the sterile smell of antiseptic and the steady beep of monitors the only indication that I had survived. My body was a patchwork of healing injuries—ribs taped, hip in a cast, skull wrapped in bandages. The doctors told me I had been in a medically induced coma, my injuries so severe that it was a miracle I had survived at all.

But as I lay there, staring up at the white ceiling tiles, I knew that the real nightmare had only just begun. The demon was still out there, and she wanted her book back. And I knew that next time, I would have to be ready. Or else
