Hey Little Adam 

From first glance you would get curious from the site just by the name too right?

I know I damn sure was. Whenever I was bored one day after school, no friends, and just sitting on my computer with a can of pop by my side scrolling through web forums. 

There was a user on there trying to promote a website I guess they built. Hey Little Adam. 

This is what the post said: 

HEY GUYS! 

Another lonely weekend bored as hell? Don't have a woman or man in your life to bring you happiness?! Or are you just looking for that little thrill to make your day or night exciting! 

Well introducing Hey Little Adam! A chatsite unlike no other! I'm not promising anything just click the link below and find out and I hope you all have fun on Adam! 

That was the basic feel of the post. I was skeptical and so we're the comments. But then I saw a few that caught my attention. 

1: Hey Little Adam is a wonderful site! Chatted with them for a few hours until sadly they had to mandatory log me out! Will use again! 

Mandatory log out? Maybe it's because of all the people wanting on the site to keep up with moderation. 

2: Hey Little Adam is so nice! I wonder who is the other person on the screen? Would really love to meet! 

Those were all the reviews which really scratched my head in. 

So I did what anyone would do in this situation. I clicked on the site. 

The site was your basic white backdrop with a login screen. I made myself a username using a email from a different site. I'm sure y'all know which one. Then I pressed login. 

I expected to wait a few minutes to be able to chat but no I was instantly greeted with a Adam_182. 

Adam_182: Hey 
DensedBucket: Hey
Adam_182: Your username is funny 

So right off the bat it just seemed like a generic conversation with a random person on the Internet. 

DensedBucket: Why is your username Adam? 
Adam_182: We are all called Adam

This made my heart race a bit. Why are they all called Adam? And who was We? I then got another message. 

Adam_182: Are you a kid like me? 

Not a big deal other kids use sites like this when they are bored as I am. 

DensedBucket: Yesâ€¦
Adam_182: He will come for you 

Now I'm sweating bullets. What did he/she mean? Unless they are just pranking me. 

DensedBucket: Who will come for me?
Adam_182: Adam he knows where you live
You live at [Redacted] 

I fell out of my chair. How did they get my address? Needless to say I logged out of my computer and unplugged it. 

I was scared shitlesss that night. My covers were drenched in sweat to go to sleep. I kept thinking on if I should tell my parents or maybe the police. 

The next week was constant paranoia. Looking over my shoulders at random passerby and car's slowly riding down the road beside me. After a week of nothing I eventually came to turns that it was only a prank. But you have to be sure sometimes. 

Then a few hours after I came home from another school day I heard a ring on my doorbell. Thinking nothing I went and opened the door and stepped out to look. That was then I heard the crunch of me stepping on something underneath my feet.

It was an apple
