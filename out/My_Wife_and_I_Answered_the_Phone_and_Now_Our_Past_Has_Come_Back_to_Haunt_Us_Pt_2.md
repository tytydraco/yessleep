[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/xaLVtezNvx)

I thank everyone who has taken the time to read my retelling of events thus far. 

This has not been an easy tale to recount for for all of you, but I still have plenty more to get off my chest. 

These are the events following the aftermath of the phone call that I have been able to compile and document.

-

“What in the hell was that?!!” Jane screeched in hysteria, gripping my shirt with a strength I didn’t know she had.

I could see a fire in her eyes that was both rage and unadulterated fear.

I felt like a statue, my limbs stuck in place as I reeled from everything in complete shock.

I should have never messed with that ouija board.

The thought filled my mind like an echo chamber.

The barrier between the living and dead was destroyed by my own hands. Now something has infiltrated our home and is toying with us.

How do we get rid of something like this?

“Hello? I’m talking to you?” A hand waved in front of me, snapping me back to reality.

I felt myself blink sharply in reaction, “I…I don’t know.”

“What do you mean you don’t know? Our dead daughter just contacted us on the phone! That’s not normal!”

I didn’t want to lie, but I couldn’t also begin telling her the truth. If she was this upset now, what she would find out would devastate her.

“Don’t worry about it. I…I’ll take care of it.” I got up to put the phone on my night side table before getting up to go downstairs.

“Take care of it? What is that supposed to mean? Why are being so weird right now?” Jane interrogated as she followed me.

“I am weirded out right now, I’m sure it was just a prank call or something.” 

My footsteps thudded down the stairs along with hers, I could hear her seething voice close behind.

“A prank caller? A prank caller has our deceased daughter’s voice? Are you out of your mind?”

She walked in front of me and stood in place, blocking my path to the basement door.

“You are hiding something”

“Jane, we are not doing this right now. Let me take care of this.” I began to walk around her but she didn’t budge.

Instead, she just crossed her arms and sighed angrily.

“No, you’re not. We are taking care of this. You can begin by telling me what is going on.” 

“Maybe it’s just better if you didn’t know.” I stated as I once again tried to step around her.

“I am your wife, I am to know everything.” 
She sprawled her arms out to the side her limbs fully blocking the door.

“What is down here?” She asked, a brow raised inquisitively.

My throat felt dry, I’ve never feared a confrontation more in my life. The love of my life stood before me but I couldn’t speak a word.

“What…is…down…here?” She repeated slowly, adding emphasis to each word.

In a twisted irony, my love for her kept my lips sealed. How do you tell your wife about a twisted obsession?

I drooped my head low for I couldn’t bear to look Jane in the eyes. She deserved to know the truth, but I didn’t want to drag her into this mess that I created.

“That night from ten years ago…the one where we…” I cut myself off before I spoke of Grace’s fate.

I saw Jane nod out of my peripheral and I continued, “Well, that and loss of family and friends over the years lead me to do something in the basement. I’m sorry Jane, this is all my fault.” 

I lifted my head up and walked towards the basement door that Jane stood in front of. I looked her in the eyes and I could see tears of anger and sadness begin to form.

I wanted nothing more than to wipe them away but in this moment, they deserved to fall.

“Let me show you.” I placed on my hand and the door knob and waited for her to step aside.

When she had done so, I opened the door slowly and turned on the light.

I guided her down the stairs where my ritual from the previous day stayed undisturbed.

When we reached the bottom of the stairs, my wife collapsed to her knees and began sobbing. 

I continued to stare stone faced at the candles that had long been blown out, surrounding the ouija board as she wept.

I’m not sure how long it was because it felt like an eternity before my wife got up from the floor and began screaming at me.

She demanded an explanation for my actions and so, I did just that.

My confession poured out of me and I did not leave a single detail unturned.

I told her about the discovery of the ouija board, I told her about my communications with my dead family members, I told her about my fascination with talking to other spirits, and then I told her about Grace and that horrifying voice.

When I had finished telling her everything I could, her expression fell blank. I watched as she shook her head, turn around, and walk up the stairs, leaving me behind in the basement.

I wouldn’t blame her if she decided to leave me, hell, I would leave myself if I were her. 

Not only did I have to repair the damage I had done with the ouija board, now I had to repair the damage that I had inflicted onto Jane and I’s relationship.

That is, if there was a way for me to mend it. 

As that depressing thought crossed my mind, I heard footsteps coming down the stairs.

A moment later my wife was beside me only I noticed she was brandishing a hammer in her right hand.

“What are you doing with that?” I asked, genuinely confused.

That blank expression from earlier was still there as she looked me in the eyes.

She then turned her gaze towards the ouija board. That’s when my mind put two and two together.

Before I could react and stop her, she flung herself towards it and began crushing it with the hammer.

The crunch of the wood as it caved from the brute force filled the basement air as I tackled Jane to the ground.

“GET OFF OF ME!” She howled in rage as the hammer dropped from her hand.

“What the hell are you doing?! Are you insane?!” You can’t just destroy the board!” I  turned to see the remains of the ouija board, cracked and destroyed from just the few blows my wife was able to land.

“Sure I can, I just did.” I saw a smirk form on her lips. 

“No, you don’t understand-“

“Get that thing out of here right now.” She cut me off as she slipped out from underneath me and slowly began walking towards the stairs to exit.

“Do you understand what you have just done?!?!” I shouted, my words falling on deaf ears as I was once again left in the basement.

Her destroying the board shattered the barrier between the living and the dead. The spirits that were in communication with me could now roam freely which meant we were in danger.

I quickly ran up the stairs behind her and turned off the lights, “Jane…you have put us both at serious risk.”

“No!” She snapped as she turned her head around to face me as she continued making her way towards our bedroom. 

“You and you alone put us at serious risk when you decided to use that stupid ouija board!” 

“There are rules Jane, and you broke one of them. The spirits are going to manifest and cause us great harm!” I clenched my fists in anger, I just wished my words would get through to her. Why couldn’t she listen to me?

“How? By pestering our phones? We will survive.” I could feel the sarcasm oozing from her words as she went into our bedroom.

“No…real, physical danger.” I stated as I stood in the door way, watching her get into bed.

“Goodnight.” She stated bluntly as she turned over on her side, refusing to face me.

I knew this side of her. She was acting tough on the exterior to hide the crippling fear on the interior.

What I had shown her had upset her and she had retaliated in the way that she thought was appropriate.

She didn’t understand like I did, and that is all I wanted her to do, understand.

The ramifications of this were going to be severe, I could just feel it in my heart.

I didn’t want to argue anymore as I knew my words would all be in vain so I took myself back downstairs towards the living room to sleep on the couch.

It was there that I lay restless, thinking of the potential horrors that could come from the destruction of the ouija board. 

It took me a long while to even begin to comfortable on the couch and fall into a slumber but eventually I know I did because I woke up to the sunlight hitting my face from the blinds.

I remember feeling strange, as I experienced something I couldn’t exactly recall. 

I can’t necessarily explain it but it felt like when I was asleep, someone was looking down at me. Like something was watching me sleep…

In the days following the phone call, Jane and I put on our masks and did our best to move on with our lives. 

We had barely spoken a word to each other in the days following the incident, but what exactly could we say to each other? 

How does any parent cope with hearing their deceased child’s voice? 

The events of that night weighed on us heavily as we strived for some sense of normalcy.

Devoid now was the happiness that filled our household. Instead, a sense of uneasiness and tension permeated in the air. 

Every moment felt like a bomb was about to go off, and Jane and I did our best to just avoid each other at all costs.

It was well-deserved, but I hated it. I missed talking to her and being by her side. Now it seemed like she couldn’t even begin to stand the sight of me.

That paired with the shadows I’ve been seeing has made me an emotional wreck.

There was always that feeling that I was being watched and every time I would turn, I would see a shadow manifested somewhere nearby.

I would see them in the hallways, in various rooms, in the shower, out of our windows, I couldn’t escape them.

I couldn’t escape the noises either, they insufferably plagued the house.

The cacophony of disembodied voices that crawled through the walls at night, the knocks, the bangs, it was madness.

No matter how hard I did my best to ignore it all, the noises wouldn’t go away.

I desperately wanted to reach out to Jane to see if she too had similar experiences but I knew better than to talk to her when she was like this.

If she wanted to talk, she would come to me first.

My first bit of communication with her came yesterday in the form of a piece of paper on the kitchen counter.

It simply read, “Clean out the basement.”

Short and to the point. That was her alright.

I hadn’t stepped foot in that basement since that night. This was for sure her way of making me go down there and clean up my mess figuratively and literally.

I sighed as I put the piece of paper back down on the counter and made my way towards the basement door.

I opened the door and my hand instinctively going towards the light switch. Instead of flicking it on however, I peered into the darkness.

What I saw sent chills down my spine.

There was an outline of a person standing directly at the bottom of the stairs looking up at me.

I instantaneously flipped the light switch on in reflex to see…nothing.

There was nobody there. The figure had vanished from view. How was that possible?

I swear I could have seen someone, but where could they have gone?

I’m going insane, first the shadows, now this? I’m like an addict suffering from withdrawals, I ridiculed myself.

I turned the light off and went to retrieve some cleaning supplies from the garage, when I happened to look back down the stairs.

The person had reappeared and was looking up at me again.

I felt myself freeze in place. Who, or what was I looking at?

I dared not move. I feared whoever was down there was going to come chasing after me.

However, that didn’t happen.

Instead, the person stood their ground firmly at the bottom of the stairs like a statue.

We stood there looking at one another for what was only a few seconds, but it felt like an eternity. 

I grew the courage to eventually turn the lights on and when I did, my eyes drifted towards the basement.

I felt the blood drain from my face as I realized…the figure hadn’t gone away when the lights came on. 

I felt a scream manifest in my throat but I was too scared to let it out. 

There at the bottom of the stairs, was Grace. Her long, brown hair looked messy and disheveled over her burial gown. 

Grace’s white skin emanated from the darkness like the light of a full moon. Her skin was cracked like porcelain on her face, neck, and arms. It gave her this peculiar look, like a doll that was left to corrode in an attic.

Her eyes that lingered upon me looked like bottomless holes. I could see remnants of a coagulated, black substance that had once creeped out of her eyes plastered across her face.

I didn’t know what to say or do, I was glued to the top of the stairs. 

Before I could react in any capacity, I felt her hair in my face and those lifeless eyes were mere centimeters away from mine. 

“Murderer.” She rasped, the smell of vast decay emanating from her breath as I felt her cold grasp upon my neck.

My heart was pounding so loud I could feel my body trembling from it. 

Sheer panic flowed through my veins and my fight or flight instincts took over.

My feet carried me away from the top of the stairs as fast as they could and towards the kitchen.

I had hoped to make it to the garage so that I could run outside but in my attempt to flea, I tripped.

I braced myself for impact and winced as I collapsed onto the floor, my head narrowly avoiding a chair at the dinner table.

The pain shot through my arms and chest as I felt the wind leave my lungs and I struggled to recapture it. 

I felt an immense dread cloud the air as I watched Grace slowly lumber from the basement entrance towards me.

My heart pulsated rapidly and I felt my eyes become immensely heavy.

I couldn’t move, I was paralyzed. My adrenaline had left just as quick as it had come to me.

To my horror, I saw Grace stand over me her corpse like figure twitching as an eerie gasp of air escaped her pale lips.

Our eyes locked and it felt like I was staring into the abyss.

She began kneeling before me, lowering herself to my level in seemingly slow motion. 

As her face came closer to mine, my eyes closed…and everything went black.

What felt like seconds later, I woke to Jane kneeling beside me and calling my name. 

I could feel myself coming back to consciousness as I rose from the ground slowly with a groan. 

What had I seen? Had it been real, or was it all just some hallucination brought on by stress and anxiety?

“What happened? I came home and I saw you on the floor.” Jane placed her hand on my back and comforted me, her eyes filled with worry. 

“I’m fine.” I grunted, still in slight pain as I got into a standing position. “I saw your note to clean out the basement and when I opened the door…I saw something”.

“Note? I didn’t write a note.” Her face displayed complete and utter confusion.

I imagined I mirrored the same look as I processed what I had just heard.

“This note!” I gestured at the kitchen counter and walked towards where the note lay. 

I picked it up and handed it to Jane. She studied the four words that were in handwriting in shock.

“I-I don’t understand. This is my handwriting but I swear to you that I didn’t write this!”

Grace. She had tried to lure me into the basement. Had I gone down there…would she have killed me? I shuddered at the thought.

Jane put the note back down on the counter and shook her head in bewilderment. 

“What exactly did you see?”

“I…I don’t know. It was like a manifestation of Grace. It wasn’t her though. It was as if something was pretending to be her.” 

I wasn’t sure how to explain what I saw, but what I was able to explain frightened her. I could tell from the look on her face.

“Are you sure?” She asked, wanting to be absolutely certain. I think she knew deep down in her heart that my words were true but she didn’t want to believe it.

“Yes, I know what I saw.” I spoke firmly, confirming what she feared.

The tense air between us collapsed and I could hear Jane choking up, on the verge of tears as she confessed.
 
“I’ve seen them, the shadows. I hear the voices too. You’re not crazy.” 

It was then that I embraced her in a hug and promised that everything would be fine. 

She sobbed into my chest and I caressed her hair as she let out her grief, her anger, and her fear into those tears. 

I didn’t want to let go. I wanted to do nothing more in that moment than protect her from the darkness that had taken residence in our home.

I cursed myself internally for bringing this upon myself and my wife. How could I be so foolish to bring something malevolent into our home? 

I’m not quite sure how much time passed as I was lost in my thoughts but eventually, Jane calmed down. 

I wiped away her tears and kissed her on the cheek gently.

This display of affection brought a faint smile to her face and shortly thereafter, we discussed what our next course of action would be.

It was our first talk in quite some time and it felt good to get what had been manifesting in ourselves out there in the open.

If the events that had taken place that day were a small taste of what was to come, we were in dire need of help.

That’s when we came to a decision, a decision that brings me to what I am about to tell all of you.

Tomorrow, I will be returning to the church I had abandoned all those years ago after Grace had died. 

I’m going to confess my sins and confide in God’s light. Hopefully I will obtain some guidance as to how to cleanse ourselves of this petrifying presence.

I will make an update post at a later time but until then, I leave everyone reading this with this lesson I have learned; 

The Devil is not as black as he is painted, for he wears the skin of your loved ones.
