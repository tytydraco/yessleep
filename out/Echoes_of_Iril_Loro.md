I’m not the kind of person who usually shares stuff like this online, but what happened to me still clings to me in a way I can’t explain. Maybe someone out there has felt something similar—some kind of pull, or echo, left behind by the people who walked through a place before you.

This happened in 2016, just before the birth of my daughter.
But it starts much earlier, in a village I visited as a child.

I grew up in Morocco in the 1990s. My family belonged to a very old community, and like many families with deep roots in the region, we occasionally made pilgrimages to the south of the country to tend to abandoned cemeteries and synagogues left behind when most of our people departed in the ’50s and ’60s.

One trip took us to a town called Iril Loro—a place no one from our community had visited in over 40 years.

I must’ve been around seven or eight. My father arranged for us to stay in the home of the local governor. During the day, we wandered around the village, a place built almost entirely of sun-dried mud brick. I remember playing with the local kids, climbing the winding streets, peeking into homes and ruins. It felt ancient and forgotten.

At some point, I asked one of the boys about a crumbling old building with a carved symbol above the door—a Star of David.
He looked uncomfortable and told me nobody went near it. It was cursed, he said. Haunted by the spirits of the people who had vanished.

I laughed it off. But I remember the feeling. Like eyes on me.
Like something inside was waiting.

That night, I had a dream.

In it, I was standing with my father at the top of a dusty stairway that wound through the village. The sky above us was a deep, unnatural gray—too dark for day, but not quite night. My father said we had to go to the synagogue. There were prayers that needed to be said, and they didn’t have enough people for a minyan—a quorum of ten required in our tradition for certain prayers.

We walked through narrow alleyways to the old building.
But when we stepped inside, it was empty—except for rows of chairs, each with an old photograph placed carefully on the seat.

Portraits. Black and white. Men in traditional robes, bearded and stern, looking out at nothing.

Then the room filled with a quiet hum.

The photos began to move.
Their mouths opened.
And they began to pray.

I woke up gasping.

I ran to my father, heart pounding. He was still awake, sitting with the governor and sipping mint tea in the courtyard.

I remember blurting out the dream all at once, barely breathing between sentences. My father, usually skeptical of anything supernatural, went quiet.

Then the governor leaned forward and asked me:
“Did you say the photos prayed?”

I nodded.

He looked at my father and said, “There is a Geniza beneath the synagogue. No one has touched it since your people left.”

A Geniza is a kind of burial vault for sacred documents—old prayer books, personal writings, anything bearing divine names. In our tradition, you don’t throw those things away. You bury them.

My father asked if anyone had been inside since the 1950s.
The governor shook his head.

The next morning, instead of heading straight to the cemetery, we went back to the synagogue. It looked just like it had in my dream—dusty, cracked, and forgotten. The Star of David above the door was chipped but still visible.

The adults began clearing the stones from the far corner of the building, revealing a small, dark hole.

The entrance to the Geniza.

It was barely wide enough for a child to fit. So, of course, they asked me to go in.

Looking back, I can’t believe I agreed. There could’ve been scorpions, snakes, or worse. But something in me felt… compelled.

They lowered me down with a rope and a flashlight. The beam of light cut through thick dust as I touched the floor.

I wasn’t sure what I expected. Parchment? Rotten wood?

Instead, I saw sacks. Dozens of them, stacked against the walls, marked with faded writing.

I walked closer.

They weren’t texts. They were burlap aid bags—stamped with markings I didn’t recognize at first.

Then I saw it: USAID. Foreign aid. Rice. Flour. Cereal.

I called up to the men above, and they helped haul the bags out one by one.

But what we found inside wasn’t food.

We opened the first sack under the flickering light of a single bulb the governor had strung up with a long extension cord. The air was thick with dust and silence.

Inside the bag weren’t grains or papers.

They were portraits. Dozens of them. Black-and-white photographs—faces frozen in time.

I recognized some of them.

Not from real life.
From my dream.

I didn’t say anything. I just stared.

My father reached in and pulled one out carefully, like it might fall apart in his hands. He stared at it for a long moment. Then he looked at me.

“You saw these people… in your sleep?”

I nodded slowly.

We opened more bags. They were all the same—photos of men, women, children. Some wrapped in plastic to protect them, others faded and cracked. Tucked between them were scraps of paper in different scripts—Hebrew, Ladino, Arabic. Letters. Prayers. Pages from books long gone.

That night, we laid the photos out in the synagogue like a gallery of ghosts. The governor lit candles, and the men in our group said Kaddish, the prayer for the departed.

It felt like something had been waiting all those years.

Some part of me thought that was the end of it.
That we’d put the spirits to rest, or whatever had clung to that room.

But I was wrong.

Because the dream came back.

I’ll post the next parts if you like the story. This is all true.
I even have photos of myself being pulled out of the Geniza as a kid.
