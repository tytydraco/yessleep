Me, my wife and my daughter who I will not be disclosing the names of recently moved into a new house. It’s a pretty house but the basement is unfinished so we’re thinking of turning it into a workshop, this would be good for my job as I often work with wood and metal. While moving in my daughter and wife went to grab food, I was left alone in the house to continue setting up. After about five minutes I heard something behind me, it was a quiet voice, almost a whisper. I walked to the basement door and it got louder so I slowly opened the door and turned the light on. Nothing. So I went down and tried calling out. Nothing, there was nobody there, I tried looking all around the basement and the whole house. I couldn’t find anyone.

By the time I finished looking, the girls got home. I figured it was my imagination and didn’t say anything to them so they didn’t get worried. We ate the food then rested for the rest of the day, we were tired from renovating all day so we went to bed at about 7pm. I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, when I was finished I went downstairs for a drink. When I was grabbing a cup I can swear I saw the shadow of someone near the basement door. When I turned on the light nothing was there so I went back upstairs to join my wife in bed. 

It happened again. When I was alone I heard the voice calling me from the basement, it was louder and more familiar. Instead of some random voice it kinda sounds like my daughter saying “dad come down, I need help” but I watched her leave the house.. I walked to the basement where the sound was coming from. As soon as I gripped the handle, the voice was gone.  The door opened to show nothing there but a dirty old staircase. This time I told my wife when she got back, this prompted her to make a joke and laugh until she saw my face. Her humorous smile quickly turned into a face of worry. “Are you sure that’s what you heard?” As I was about to answer her my attention shifted behind her, in the closet I saw someone crouched down staring at me. I lightly shoved her and ran to the empty closet, there was nobody there. I looked back to my confused and slightly annoyed partner to explain everything.

Now every time it’s dark I see people around my house slowly inching closer to me. I’m also hearing the voice more at night, it gets louder and more insistent every time. I think it wants me to find it but I can’t, maybe I have to look deeper.. I think this repeated event is starting to take a toll on me, I’m more on edge recently and I’m also getting less sleep.

It happened again like normal but it was different.. this time when I heard it,it was so loud and when I went down, I saw her run down. I darted down the stairs and tripped down the last few steps but I didn’t see anything. I heard my daughter run downstairs to ask if I’m okay so I told her I’m fine and went back up. Even during the day when there’s other people around me I hear incoherent whispering and murmuring around me.

My family is starting to get worried, I’m often distracted by things moving and people talking that aren’t really there. I’ve also been a bit more short tempered and quiet according to them. 

I’m scared. They’re everywhere, I can’t get rid of them. The whispers are louder and the one in the basement in almost yelling at me to find them. I NEED to find them or something will happen. What if they do something to my family? What if they need help? I need to find out.

I’ve been tearing up the basement for hours but I still can’t find anything. I go to the basement and stay for hours every day. If I don’t find who’s calling for me what will happen? I’ve been in the basement for days, I see people in the dark corners and they are talking to me.

My wife is trying to get me out of the basement, she’s suggesting therapy or moving out. She must be crazy, I have to find the truth. 

We had a fight yesterday because she tried to force me out of the basement but I don’t want to leave, even my daughter is trying to get me out. I think they’re trying to hide it from me, but I won’t let them keep me away from the truth.

The crazy woman called a priest. I don’t know what to do anymore, she scares me. When he came in and started the ritual I had to stop him. I smashed his holy water and shouted at him before returning to the basement.

I haven’t left the basement in days.. I haven’t left the house in even longer. I can’t remember the last time I opened the front door, my eyes are dark, I’m pale and I’ve lost a lot of weight from not eating or going outside. But it’s worth it if I can find out the truth. The voice went from whispering to talking, to yelling and now it’s screaming my name. I don’t know how she can’t hear it, the screams echo through the house even when everyone is downstairs. 

My wife has been crying a lot, I haven’t seen her or my daughter in a little while, they must be hiding from the monsters around the house because I heard them say something about not feeling safe here anymore. I’m not sure when they’ll come back down but I need to find the truth. 

I don’t think it’s just in the basement, I couldn’t see it because it’s in the walls. I need to tear down the walls and find them. I’ve started ripping the walls down so I’m gonna start on the floors. 

I KNOW HOW TO FIND THEM. THEY ARE DEEP IN THE GROUND SO IF I GO DOWN FURTHER I WILL FIND THE SOURCE OF THE VOICE  MY JOURNEY WILL FINALLY BE OVER!!

I’ve finally lived my truth. I found my people, the beautiful tall people with their gorgeous glowing eyes. I heard police at the top of my cavern with my daughter. I need to call her down so she can find us. I whisper her name so she will find me soon and join this new family I’ve created :)
