Lana Dawson welcomed me into the house with a tired smile.

She was desperate—like everyone who hires a medium. And I was just as desperate, which is why I was back to this gig. Trying other jobs only confirmed that I wouldn’t make a living doing anything else.

Lana hired me because it had been twenty years since her parents were brutally murdered in that house—a crime that remained unsolved despite an extensive police investigation. She was luckily at her grandma's when it happened.

Even private detectives had put their hands in the case and found nothing. In the end, I imagine reluctantly, she found me through a friend of a friend. 

Luckily for her, I needed the money and booked my flight right away.

It was a typical home in a quiet suburban neighborhood, surrounded by mostly vacant houses. Lana decided to never sell it, simply keeping it empty, frozen in time. Perhaps hoping some day it would help her find the truth.

As I walked inside, an old woman next door was watering her plants, the only neighbor left. She glanced over and gave me a polite wave.

"This is a peaceful neighborhood of mostly widows and retirees," Lana explained later. "Nothing like that ever happened before or after."

The sorrow still present on her face was undeniable—I imagine from the weight she had surely carried all these years.

–

The living room was completely empty. Not even spiders roamed around. There was just dust and a single light bulb no one had ever bothered to take down. 

Lana pulled back the curtain, flooding the space with sunlight—probably for the first time in years.

She gave me a quick tour through the kitchen and bedrooms. I could tell she wasn’t very hopeful that I’d find anything, and I couldn’t blame her. Never promise a client results—that’s a rule I learned early on.

Most of the time, when I visit “haunted” houses, there’s nothing to see. Either the dead moved on, or they simply don’t want to be disturbed. Not the kind of pitch that brings in clients.

But spirits tend to remain where they died. The energy of death clings to a place, anchoring them there. If Lana’s parents still lingered in this house, they could talk to me.

I asked her for a chair and placed it in the center of the living room.

"I’ll try to channel the voices of the spiritual world now," I told her. "So please, we need to remain silent."

That was just a fancy way of telling her to stay quiet so I could hear if any dead would actually talk.

I sat down and closed my eyes.

–

For several minutes, I waited in silence, hearing nothing but the wind and birds outside.

I was ready to give up and explain to Lana my no-refund policy when I heard faint weeping. It was soft, almost inaudible, and gradually grew louder.

"Is there someone here among us?" I called out firmly.

The crying stopped, and a metallic, ethereal voice asked, "Can you hear me?"

"Yes, I can. Who are you?"

No response. The entity simply resumed crying. I explained what I heard to Lana, who was now slightly more excited by the discovery. It could be her family.

"Please, tell me. Are you Mr. or Ms. Dawson?" I tried.

The weeping stopped abruptly.

"Do you know where Ms. Dawson is?" the voice asked. "I want to tell her I’m sorry."

"What do you mean? Sorry for what?"

The light flickered for a second, and I saw the curtains shift slightly before the answer came.

"For what I did to her," the voice confessed, its tone laced with sorrow. "For killing her the way I did."

I felt my heart pound in my chest and turned to Lana. 

"I don’t think this is your family."

–

Now, in my experience, spirits can be deceitful. It wouldn’t be the first time some smart-ass ghost tried to play me for a fool, so I didn’t immediately relay all I had heard to Lana. 

She would probably freak out anyway, and I needed her to stay quiet for the rest of the session.

"Who are you?" I asked next, to no response.

"Do you know what happened that day?" I tried again. This time, after a long pause, the voice answered.

"It wasn’t supposed to happen like that," it murmured. "She shouldn’t have had to die."

That was an interesting response. 

"What about Mr. Dawson?" I asked.

"The man got what he deserved!" The voice suddenly deepened, taking on an almost demonic tone. The light bulb flickered violently.

Its reaction made sense based on what I had read about the crime scene. Mr. Dawson had died from fifteen stab wounds, most likely in his bed. The killer was probably driven by emotion.

But Ms. Dawson showed signs of a struggle—her only fatal injury was a deep slice across her neck. Maybe her death wasn’t intentional at first.

This could actually be the murderer.

"But why did you do it?" I decided it was time for tough questions. "I just want to help you find peace. It’s the only way you’ll leave this house and see her again."

There was a long silence. Then it spoke, its words thick with emotion.

"Because I loved her more than anything… I used to watch her every day. Getting in her car, walking the dog, buying groceries. She did it all with that same smile. When she waved at me, I felt it in my bones. My wife hated it... she knew I was in love with Ms. Dawson, that's why...". It stopped. 

"That doesn’t explain why you killed her," I pressed. 

My questions likely revealed the true nature of the voice to Lana, and her eyes widened in shock.

"I didn’t want to!" the voice roared. The bulb exploded, making Lana jump. "I just wanted to get rid of him so we could be together! But she wouldn’t accept it… she… wouldn’t come with me."

The weeping resumed. I pressed for more answers, but got nothing.

Everything I had heard spun in my mind like a whirlwind. When everything clicked, I stood up and walked to the door.

Lana was as pale as snow, visibly shaken by what had happened—even if she hadn’t heard a word, the energy in the room was impossible to ignore.

She asked me why I was leaving.

"I’m just thirsty," I casually said. "There’s no running water here, so I’ll ask the neighbor for a glass. I’ll be back in a minute."

–

The neighbor looked surprised to see me knocking on her door. She was a tiny, fragile lady. Maybe in her seventies.

She was making bread but stopped to answer and invited me in for some water. As I followed her to the kitchen, I took the opportunity to observe her home—furniture that had to be at least half a century old and a large portrait in the living room of her and her husband, taken long ago.

She handed me a glass of water and went back to kneading the fresh dough.

"I hope you don’t mind me doing this," she said, using all her small weight against it. "I just love having them ready for dinner."

"Don’t mind me at all," I thanked her, sipping the water slowly. "By the way, you and your husband are so beautiful together in that photo," I said, referring to the portrait.

Her face stiffened for a brief moment before returning to its usual warm smile. She confessed to me he had abandoned her years ago, but it was hard to let go of the memories. One day he simply got out and never returned.

Determined to change the subject, she asked what I was doing in that dusty, abandoned house. I told her I was a medium.

"Oh, that’s fun," she giggled. "Did you find anything there?"

"Yes, as a matter of fact, I did," I answered. "I found your husband. He told me a lot about you, about him… and about what he did to the Dawson family."

She froze, hands still buried in the dough. Slowly, she turned around, scanning my face to see if I was joking, if I really knew the truth about what had happened twenty years ago.

I didn’t. It was a bluff, an educated guess.

For the killer to be a spirit trapped in that house, he had to have died nearby. For him to know the private details of Ms. Dawson’s life, he had to be someone that lived close. Someone who could watch her every move. Like a neighbor. And there were not many of them around here.

I had no idea it would work, my theory could be pretty much wrong. But the bluff paid off, because the woman broke down in tears.

–

For Lana, finding the truth was all that mattered—and I gave it to her.

Her family had been killed by a neighbor obsessed with her mother. In a moment of madness, he took advantage of the night to break into the house and confess his feelings just as she had gone to the kitchen for a glass of water.

When she rejected him, he grabbed her and slit her throat with a sharp fish knife. Then, in a fit of rage, he walked into the bedroom where the father slept and stabbed him to death.

It took me a few more sessions with the killer to get the whole truth out.

The neighbor’s wife confirmed and admitted to Lana that she had suspected her husband all along. And when she confronted him, he fled, never to be found, probably dying somewhere years later.

The end.

Or at least that’s the end I told Lana.

I can’t say she was happy about it, but at least she knew now. There could finally be peace.

What I didn’t tell her was that the husband never fled. And his wife didn’t simply confront him with words.

When he arrogantly admitted to the crime, showing no remorse, she shot him with the handgun they kept under the bed and buried him in the backyard.

I advised the woman to lie to Lana—keeping her safe from any legal trouble. That way, everything would end up in its right place.

The old woman, in her home.

The husband, trapped inside that house, drowning in his own despair.

Screw his peace.

The end.
