I’m writing this to prove I existed. If someone reads this, maybe it'll mean I was real. My name is \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. I live in \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*. Or at least, I did. I don't know anymore. Maybe I’m dead. Maybe not. I can’t tell how long I’ve been here—days, weeks, longer? Time's twisted here. It doesn’t behave.

I’m not the type to stand out. I’m the kind of person who can disappear for months without anyone truly wondering where I went. I have friends—real ones. Ones who care. Ones who keep trying to drag me back out into the world. But I don’t like the world. I like my apartment. My bubble. It’s safe. It’s quiet. It doesn't judge me.

I close my curtains and pretend the city outside doesn’t exist. I keep the lights off, and the blinds sealed tight. My whole life is inside these walls: sleep, eat, work online, play games alone, repeat. That cycle became my heartbeat. In here, my time didn’t move forward. It just looped. Days blurred together like brushstrokes smeared across the same gray canvas. Loneliness used to hurt, but eventually, it became a comfort. At least when you’re alone, no one expects anything from you.

Until one day, my walls cracked.

My friends had been pushing harder than usual. Maybe they sensed something. Maybe they saw through the persona I wear when I occasionally answer their texts. I must’ve let my defenses down for a moment, because I said yes. A week from now. Dinner. One night. Just a short trip out of isolation. I regretted it immediately.

That entire week dragged like the countdown to an execution. I barely slept. My chest stayed tight. I kept procrastinating. I kept telling myself I’d cancel. I’d fake an illness. My imagination ran wild trying to craft believable excuses. But none of them left my mouth. Because I’m an agoraphobic socially awkward shut-in, not an asshole. I stick to my word. Even if it kills me.

The day was here before I knew it. My phone lit up with excited messages. My stomach churned like it was full of broken glass. I stepped into the shower for the first time in what felt like forever. My greasy hair resisted the shampoo like it was protesting. I changed out of my pajama pants—those loyal sentinels of comfort—and dressed like someone who belonged in public.

Every step toward the front door felt unnatural. Like gravity was defying me. I grabbed my phone, my keys, and stared at the doorknob as if it might bite. When I finally opened it, the hallway beyond felt alien. Over lit and too quiet. Only three other people stood out there, yet I felt exposed, as if their eyes pierced straight through me.

I avoided eye contact and made a slow, awkward shuffle to the elevator. Every part of me screamed to turn around, lock the door, disappear. But I didn't. I pressed the button.

The elevator opened like it was waiting to swallow me whole. I stepped inside, still trembling. The panel stared back, bland and metallic. I hit the lobby button and the doors closed.

I watched my reflection in the brushed steel interior. I looked like a ghost. My hands shook. My eyes were sunken. I felt like a fraud. A walking failure trying to pretend he could just slip back into society. My breathing grew shallow. The descent was slow—too slow. Time warped, stretched like molasses.

Then everything changed.

A violent jolt shook the elevator. The lights flickered—rapidly strobing like lightning trapped inside the walls. The shaking got worse, like the elevator was resisting gravity. I stumbled, grasped for the emergency button—but it wasn’t there. Or rather, it was… translucent. Unreal. Like a desert mirage pretending to be solid.

Only one button was left. Glossy. Unlabeled. It practically pulsed under the dim light. I didn’t want to touch it—but I had no other choice. I pressed it.

Instantly, the shaking stopped. The lights snapped off, plunging me into suffocating darkness. Silence wrapped around me, thicker than air. I slumped to the floor.

Then, the lights came back—soft, strange, dimmer than before. And the elevator began descending again. Smooth. Silent. Unnatural.

I tried to collect myself. I rubbed my eyes and leaned back against the wall. At some point, I must’ve passed out. When I woke up, nothing had changed.

I was still in the elevator.

It was *still going down.*

My phone was gone, as if the elevator didn’t *want* me to have it.

The panel had changed again. No longer hazy or flickering—it looked solid now. But still... one button. Still no label.

And I realized, with a sinking horror, that I no longer had the tiniest bit of control that I had before. Wherever I was going—it wasn’t dinner. It wasn’t back to my apartment. It wasn’t anywhere I recognized.

The elevator was taking me somewhere else.



The elevator slowed, then stopped.

No ding. No announcement. Just a soft metallic breath, like something exhaling through the cracks in reality. The doors parted.

Beyond them wasn’t a lobby.

It was a wasteland.

The air glistened with a sickly haze that bent light in unnatural ways, warping the horizon like a wave. A scorched sky hung overhead, low and oppressive, painted in shades of nuclear dusk—deep amber bleeding into toxic moss. The ground was fractured, veined with glowing fissures that pulsed rhythmically, like the earth itself living. I had to make a decision. After what felt like an eternity, I stepped out, against every instinct I had.

The elevator didn’t wait. It closed behind me and vanished. Like it had never been there at all.

The silence was violent. No birds. No wind. No signs of life, but somehow, I felt watched. Like the land itself had eyes, buried somewhere under the cracked soil.

My footsteps crunched over glassy fragments of something that might’ve once been buildings. Metallic skeletons jutted from the ground, twisted beyond recognition. I passed what looked like a melted swing set half-buried in ash. A child’s toy sat nearby, half-disintegrated, staring at me with hollow eyes that made me look away.

I tried calling out, just to hear something besides the hum of the atmosphere. My voice came out strange—muted, swallowed instantly, like the place didn’t want sound.

Then I heard it.

A groan. A massive, heavy exhale from something far off in the distance. Something alive. The sound rolled across the wasteland like thunder wrapped in breathing. I dropped to the ground and waited.

Far across the glowing ravine, a shadow moved.

It was big—no, enormous. Something primal and wrong. Its outline shimmered as if reality couldn’t decide what shape it should be. It had legs, maybe. Or arms. Or too many of both. I couldn’t tell if it was walking or dragging itself, but every time it moved, the ground beneath it recoiled. I felt it in my bones.

I wanted to lay down in the fetal position and disappear, but staying meant being found. And I didn’t want to know what happens when it finds someone.

I scrambled behind a chunk of rebar, my breath hitching. My throat felt scorched just from being in the air. I scanned for shelter, or anything resembling a way out.

That’s when I saw it. In the distance—a metal structure. Boxy. Familiar. Another elevator.

It stood out like a relic from my world, surrounded by twisted terrain like an island of normalcy in a sea of decay. But it was far. Too far. And between me and it… was the creature.

I don’t know how long I waited. Time didn’t feel real here. But eventually, it turned. It moved in another direction, slow and groaning, like it had somewhere to be—or maybe it didn’t care anymore.

I ran.

Every step felt like it weighed a hundred pounds. The air tasted metallic. The land shifted beneath me, like it was trying to make me trip. But I reached the elevator. It was just standing there. No walls. No enclosure. Just the doors and the panel.

It opened before I pressed anything. I stepped inside. No hesitation. The doors closed. It began to descend.



Nothing had changed, but everything felt different.

The elevator no longer hummed. It listened.

I stayed standing at first, rigid and alert, like prey that hadn’t yet been spotted. The fluorescent light above blinked intermittently—long pauses, brief flickers—its rhythm broken, like a metronome set to an irregular heartbeat.

The tension stretched, rubbery and thin. I sat down.

The carpet was coarse. Cheap. Synthetic fibers pressed into my palms as I lowered myself. The air inside the elevator was thick, bordering on hostile, like the pressure in an airplane just before something goes wrong.

I gasped.

Not from panic—something deeper. Like I’d been holding my breath for years without noticing. Like oxygen had been rationed in this place, and now I was stealing it back. My chest rose, fell. Rose. Fell. Nothing else moved.

I lost track of time again.

It wasn’t hours, or minutes. It was something older, something more ancient. I sat there in that suspended moment, breathing as if relearning how. The silence had shape now, filling corners, creeping across surfaces, folding around my body like weighted fabric.

Then—ding.

Not loud. Not cheerful. Just inevitable.

The doors parted. And he entered. Slowly.

As if gravity worked differently for him. Each step was surgically placed, heel then toe, with no sound. A silhouette made of wrong angles and soft suggestions of humanity—a suit filled not by flesh, but by the memory of it. His face wasn’t blank. It was unfinished. Wet clay, smoothed over where features should’ve formed. All but the eyes. Round. Bulging. Fixed ahead like spotlights in a fog.

He didn’t acknowledge me. Not even with a twitch.

He took his place near the doors and stood with the posture of someone used to being ignored. Limp arms. A tilt of the head that spoke of habit, not awareness. If this elevator had mirrors, I wondered if they’d reflect him at all.

The doors closed. We descended.

The space shrank—not physically, but spiritually. The silence grew legs and crawled up the walls, settling into my ears like parasites. I didn’t dare shift. Even the sound of blinking felt like a scream. My throat burned with restraint, lungs aching not from lack of air, but the effort it took to remain invisible.

A scent crept in.

Dust. Sweat. Old paper. Like a forgotten file cabinet forced open in the dark. It wasn’t a smell—it was a memory leaking from the vents.

Then—ding.

He moved. Not urgently. Not eagerly. Just… necessarily.

The doors opened to a hallway.

A hallway that knew shame.

Muted colors. Carpets in grayscale. Fluorescent strips set into the ceiling, sputtering in sequence like Morse code tapping out past mistakes. Doors lined each side. Wooden. Identical. Almost closed—but not quite. Each one inviting yet hostile.

He stepped out.

The elevator didn’t wait. But I watched.

Inside those barely-ajar doorways came noises. Not words. No language. Just reactions. Emotion sculpted into sound. A gasp at the wrong moment. A laugh that wasn’t with you. The shrill pitch of someone pretending not to notice you. A whisper meant to be overheard.

Figures emerged, clothed in expectation. Business attire. Party dresses. School uniforms. They drifted around him. Orbiting. Talking. Living.

But never seeing him. Not really.

He remained still in the center of their world, unmoving, unmoved. A relic. A placeholder for someone more acceptable. More social. More “normal.” Their conversations passed through him like smoke. Their joy ignored his presence like it was background noise.

Just before the doors slid shut, he turned.

Not fully. Just enough. Not to make eye contact. Just enough to be known.

And then he was gone.

The elevator was mine again.

But emptier. Somehow.



During the descent, I reached into my pocket without thinking. And it was there. My phone.

I don’t remember getting it back. Not after what happened. Not after what should’ve happened. I don’t remember feeling it. I didn’t hear it vibrate. But it’s here now. Warm. Flickering. Like it never left.

So I’m typing this now. From inside the elevator.

It’s still going down. This time feels longer than the last. The lights overhead still pulse with their slow, rhythmic hum. The walls don’t look the same anymore.

I don’t know where I’m going. But I know I’ll be there soon.
