The human brain is programmed to have a set number of thoughts and memories in its lifetime. When a person has reached this limit, they either die or suffer an auto-induced coma. If a person is about to die without reaching that threshold, however, the brain releases chemicals that make it experience some thoughts and memories it would've gone through had it lived a full life. Every part of the brain lights up with electric pulses and chemical reactions, and after a few moments, abruptly shuts down to oblivion. Normally, after someone has experienced this, all brain activity ceases, and the person is pronounced dead. I’m not normal. 

I was only a child when I experienced this. The rain poured while eight-year-old me danced around my backyard. Laughter filled the air as I swirled around in a state of euphoria alongside my childhood friend who we’ll call Grace. 

While I was having fun, a finger tapped my shoulder. 

*“Tag, you’re it!”* 

I looked back and rushed towards Grace’s fleeting figure. 

We ran around the neighbourhood, clueless to the ways of the world and unfortunately, to its perils. Two blinding lights pierced the rain’s veil, and we froze like deer in the headlights to the screech of skidding tires. I drifted in and out of consciousness while the sound of sirens blared, and people stood around me surrounded by blinding lights. 

Suddenly, I woke up alone in a cubical room. After getting my bearings I stood up and looked around. The room didn’t seem to have a color—as if the walls were non-existent, and I could look far into emptiness. Regardless, I felt that there were walls around the room, and I was proven right when I walked into one. Rather, I kept moving in a direction for some time, but I always found myself as close to the center as I was earlier. I looked up and saw an infinity of nothingness, as if I were staring up into a starless night sky without the moon’s soft glow. After looking closer I made out figures that were several shades darker than the void, like shadows lurking through a muddy river. They didn’t seem to take notice of me. 

There was a door on each side of the room. Each looked essentially the same, but something made each door unique. Although a sense of nostalgia emanated in varying degrees, I felt different emotions resonate from each one. One door felt painful to approach; my chest tightened as if my heart were shattering. Another door felt warm—comforting even. When I went closer, the smell of wet grass and earthy rain filled my nose. 

On opening the door, everything looked blurry. However, a little concentration helped me make out some details. The sun shone weakly through grey clouds while fine drops of rain fell, making me feel warm and cold at the same time. A person who resembled an older version of me was spinning around alongside a person who resembled an older version of Grace. At first, I thought it was just a coincidence. Sure, a lot of people look like one another but the one thing that differentiates them is personality. But after some time, I could swear that they and we were one and the same. They had the same smiles on our faces, the same playfulness we had, and the same shines in our eyes. But one thing was different. They were holding each other’s hands, the sparkles in their eyes seeming to be lit by the passions they had for each other. 	 

I laughed,  

**“Grace and me? But she’s like a sibling to me.”**  

As I chuckled to myself, a resounding bang came from somewhere far away, probably a dozen rooms from where I was. I froze, trying to figure out what might have caused this. A few minutes passed by and still nothing. I looked around and saw the vision of me and Grace repeating, going blurrier until a dark void replaced it with traces of shadows, much like the ones above the sky.  

Another bang rang out, this time unmistakably just a few doors from me. Goosebumps crept up my body as I finally got a sense of what the sound was: a door being shut close. I wasn’t alone, something was coming after me.  

Only then did I notice that there was a door on each side of this room too. I bolted after a random door. Despair filled my core for every step I took closer to that door. However, this didn’t overpower my fear as the bangs behind me steadily sped up. 

Tears were falling from my eyes, not from the bangs but from the room. I barged in and studied the surroundings, curious for what about this room made my heart a fragmented mess. Inside, it was also blurry, like when car windows fog up. Blurs continued to swirl around but I made out a person in a room’s doorframe with a silhouette behind them. Suddenly, I heard a horrific scream and before the image became clearer, the door bangs became more imminent, making me dart for another door in terror. 

Different types of tears started falling from my eyes, tears of euphoria. Each step I took made me a little bit happy inside. I slowly forgot the pain I felt earlier, and I rushed eagerly towards this door.  

After entering the room, I felt like I was on top of the world, like I had experienced a hundred victories. A sports commentator hyped up a roaring crowd. Cheers erupted from all around and from what I could hear, an underdog team had just done the impossible and emerged victorious over a juggernaut of a team. The crowd ceaselessly screamed, and some were even jumping up and down on the stage, resulting in a series of \*Bang\* \*Bang\* **\*BANG\***. Everyone continued to go wild until the crowd was suddenly snuffed out. Their images faded like lines of candles being blown out one by one and the whole room slowly lost its colors and hues until only a chilling darkness remained. However, the bangs did not recede and instead were getting louder and faster. I realized too late that the sounds were getting nearer when the door behind me blew open.  

As soon as it did, the whole room blackened even more, if that were possible, and the few shadows that remained were drowned out by a darker void like black ink drops spreading across grey water. A petrifying coldness climbed up my nerves and I couldn’t resist the urge to look slowly behind. There was nothing, rather I couldn’t see it at first, but I knew from how my heart stopped that something was there. Among the shadows I could sense a being that seemed to suck out all the light and life in the room. It replaced the shout of the crowd with a deafening silence and the cheerful atmosphere with a sense of dread. However, although void surrounded everything, the doorframe of the room it came in from was directly behind this creature as if framing it in a picture, and a silhouette could eventually be seen.  

It had no definite form, changing and twisting the shadows according to its will. At one point, it looked like a person but with limbs longer than usual like arms that somehow reached a couple inches below its knees, legs that were broken in too many places that it seemed a miracle it could stand up, and a threatening posture that was too stooped forward for any normal human as if it would pounce at any time. Then, painful cracks from what I could only guess were broken bones filled the air like hard celery breaking. Its limbs began to pop and divide, morphing into what looked like diverging cracks that slowly spread out like tree roots. It gradually reached toward me, and through the randomness of its forms there was one thing constant, the feeling that something was out of place. I realized that the forms I was seeing were the lies of my eyes, pathetic estimations of whatever the creature could look like in an attempt by my brain to make sense of what it was seeing and to keep its sanity. It probably could feel that I was looking at it and as soon as it did, it moved away from the doorframe and into the cover of shadows. The winds became erratic, as if they were running away from something massive which was moving towards me. Every part of my body, every aspect of my soul was desperate to run away, and so I did.  

I dashed through numerous doors with scene after scene playing through blurry backgrounds. With each room I passed, the visions became duller and darker to the point that it was like running through the bottom of a muddy ocean. Eventually, it reached a point where even the doors were becoming less visible and after some time, I somehow reached a dead end.  

Everything around this room abruptly ceased to move and the scenes looked frozen in time. The only door in the room was the one I came through. A loud boom from behind made me look. Two red dots appeared which I assumed were its eyes until more glowing dots blinked into view. For each step it took toward me, I took a step back until it reached a point where it didn’t matter as I reached one of those invisible walls.   

Ice-cold blood flowed through my veins as it reached out a morphing branch of dripping darkness towards me. Upwards in the dark sky, I could see the figures were no longer moving around. It looked like they were leaning towards me, investing their full attention on me. I could sense a tinge of amusement and anticipation from them. 

Suddenly, the thing's branching limb started piercing my chest and I could feel a static noise spreading across my soul. Red stains filled my vision as I looked up in agony and saw the shadows above vibrating in excitement. Just as I was about to pass out, a white flash shot across the sky, lighting it up in the process and illuminating the figures’ outlines. They were many but they moved as one, like a huge school of fish changing shape with the blink of an eye. Looking back in front of me, the thing seemed to be surprised with most of its eyes staring up at the same light. Then it snapped its gaze towards me and just as it rushed nearer, I woke up to the light of a room surrounded by what I assumed were surgeons.  

Apparently, I was already pronounced dead after some hours on the surgery table but Grace, even after just finishing her own surgery, somehow forced herself into my surgery room and punched my chest repeatedly until I revived. After a couple of questions, a ton of tests, and a lot of scolding from our moms, the hospital eventually cleared us to go.  

A couple of months passed by. Grace and I already were trying to forget about the whole thing and decided to go to an Esports tournament just to watch a few games. The atmosphere was filled with the electricity of anticipation and cheers. Out of nowhere, fireworks were shooting up and erupting in bangs, painting the stadium with a plethora of colors. At the time, I only felt a familiar sensation, like I’d experienced this scene before, the exact same resonation of the crowd’s cheers. However, I didn’t think much about it and just continued to enjoy the game as it was. Several years passed by, and I decided to propose to Grace. It was just a simple proposal near our childhood home when rain started to fall. Although our clothes got ruined, we just laughed it off as we played around in the rain. Yet again I experienced that same sensation of familiarity. Over the course of a few more years, I continued to have those kinds of familiar moments; in some way I kind of anticipated them coming. I didn’t think too much about it and continued with life until one afternoon with Grace. 

We were hanging out and I was showing off some card “tricks”. She was easily impressed as I always knew the exact card she picked all the time. With wonder in her eyes, she said:

*“I didn’t know you had a knack for card tricks.”* 

I smiled and took it one step further by writing the name of a card on a piece of paper before Grace picked a card. I would then show her the paper to show an exact card match. We did this a couple of times, and I thought we were having a great time—until the look of amazement in her eyes slowly morphed into confusion, and then nervousness.  

**“What’s wrong Grace?”** 

An awkward silence ensued. I waited for a response, for any semblance of acknowledgement about what just happened. I laughed forcedly to try to break the tension. 

**“Are you okay?”** 

Some heavy heartbeats and a blink went by. She seemed to snap back into reality. Suddenly, a spark lit in her eyes, and she bombarded me with questions. 

*“How long have you been doing this?”* 

**“Ever since the incident.”** 

*“Are you just a really good guesser?”* 

**“If I were, I would have missed some card guesses.”** 

*“So, you can see the future?”* 

**“I thought everyone could do it.”** 

Her eyes narrowed in thought, then lit back up again. 

*”How far can you see into the future?”* 

**“I don’t know how to explain it, but I can remember more of the future than I can remember most of my past.”**  

A wave of understanding flew through me. She saw that I was getting what she meant. 

 *“If you could see the future-…“* 

**“…maybe we could take advantage of it.”** 

And so, we did. We bet on games, bought some stocks, and gambled. We got kicked out of multiple casinos because of how often we won. She couldn’t believe it at first when I announced the digits of the upcoming winning lottery numbers. Everything was going perfectly well until one evening. 

We were drinking wine on the balcony of our newly bought house while gazing at the horizon. The dark sky was glittered with stars and the city below shimmered with light, like an ocean mirroring the galaxy above. The trees were swaying, murmuring amongst themselves while spreading a sappy scent across the air. The only thing that topped this view was Grace’s eyes as they twinkled among the stars. She noticed me staring and slowly drifted her eyes towards me. 

*“Gosh, I can’t believe we’d be together like this, staring at the stars while sipping wine that we’d only be able to buy with months of average pay.”* 

I thought about how it all started. The sprinkle of the rain, the euphoria of our childhood, and the headlights that should have ended it all. I smiled at the irony. 

**“Who would’ve thought that an accident could give us this new life?”** 

Then, as the silky silver rays of the moon touched her face, she trapped me in an alluring gaze and went closer to me until I could feel her breath. I closed my eyes and expected her welcoming touch when suddenly, the bang of a slamming door echoed a couple of floors below us. Grace yelped in surprise. A familiar sense of dread rolled across me like a cold wind travelling from my feet upwards. The door slams continued as Grace slowly went to investigate. I was too caught up in my confusion, in my slow remembrance of the day of my accident, that I almost didn’t notice the sudden silence around the house. The trees stopped talking, insects stopped calling among themselves, and my heart stopped beating when I saw that “thing” framed against the doorway of the room with Grace walking unknowingly towards it. I finally found my voice. 

**“Grace!”** 

It all happened in the blink of an eye. As she slowly turned towards me with fear evident in her eyes, the thing reached its void towards her, pulled her, and then slammed the door. Without hesitation, I ran towards the door and pulled it open only to see an empty corridor. The sounds of the world resumed, and I wailed in defiance. It should have taken me; Grace didn’t deserve what happened. 

I searched through my memories for any clue about what I could do. I somehow remember this exact thing happening in my memories, but I'm not sure what happened next. Then, another door slammed. I assumed too early that it was done. I jumped off the balcony and slid down through the roof. Door slams faded behind me as I ran for my life to the forest around the house.  

I’ve probably been running for a couple of minutes now. I am certain that there are no houses around me since we live in a relatively isolated place. However, I swear I hear something among the trees, like the mumble of rocks clashing against each other deep underwater. A couple of minutes ago, I found some cell reception in an opening among the trees and have tried asking for help, but was laughed off as I told them about how some void thing kidnapped my wife and that I could remember the future. I don’t blame them for not believing me, and I guess I wouldn’t blame you either. My memories of the future converge to a dead-end at this point and I don’t remember anything else. The rumbles are getting closer now. Somehow, they still sound like door slams even though I’m in the middle of a forest. I don’t know what to do but keep running around the forest and hoping that it never finds the door behind me.
