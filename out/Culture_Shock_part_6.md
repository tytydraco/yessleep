The children attacked at dawn.

Not sunset, when we expected danger. Not midnight, when aswang power peaked. But dawn – when our guard was lowest, when Lola Rosa's wards were weakest, when the night's horrors should have been retreating.

They came through the windows of our healing house, their small bodies twisted into impossible shapes, their tongues weaponized into barbed whips. The patients we'd been trying to save turned on us, their transformations accelerating at the sight of their transformed siblings.

"Don't kill them!" Maria shouted as I raised the stingray tail. "They're still children!"

But were they? The thing that had once been a six-year-old girl lunged at me, her ribcage opening like a flower made of teeth. Inside, where her heart should have been, dozens of tiny mouths whispered Susannah's name.

We lost three patients that morning. Not to death – to transformation. By the time we drove the children back, half our healing house had turned, breaking free to join the growing army of monsters outside.

"It's starting," Lola Rosa said, treating the acid burns left by transformed children's saliva. "The final push. They're done playing."

She was right. The attacks came in waves after that. Coordinated. Strategic. The aswang had never hunted like this before, had never worked together with such terrible purpose.

Monday: They poisoned the town's water supply with something that made people's organs try to escape through their skin.

Tuesday: Every pet in the village transformed simultaneously, turning on their owners with too many teeth and impossible anatomies.

Wednesday: All the pregnant women in three neighboring villages went into labor at once, birthing things that slithered away into the darkness.

"They're changing their tactics," Maria observed as we fortified the healing house. "Before, they hunted to feed. Now they're hunting to transform. To recruit."

But it was worse than that. They weren't just spreading their curse – they were rewriting the rules of reality itself. Each new transformation was stranger than the last, defying not just biology but physics. Space warped around their victims. Time moved wrong in transformed areas.

I found myself both horrified and fascinated. The monster in my blood recognized the pattern, understood the terrible beauty of what they were creating. Sometimes I caught myself admiring the elegant brutality of their attacks, the artistry of their corruption.

"Focus," Maria would snap when she caught me staring too long at the transformations. "Remember what they really are."

But what they really were was changing too.

Then came the night we thought we'd won.

It started with a breakthrough – Lola Rosa found a way to strengthen her protective wards using the essence of partially transformed victims who'd successfully turned back. My blood, purified through weeks of suffering, became a key ingredient.

The new wards worked better than we'd dreamed. When Susannah's family attacked that night, they couldn't break through. More than that – the wards hurt them. Really hurt them.

For the first time, we heard aswang scream in pain rather than pleasure.

"We can fight back," Maria said, her eyes shining as she watched them retreat. "We can hurt them now."

Watching Susannah writhe against the barrier, her impossible form trying to find a way through, I felt a surge of triumph. Of hope. The monster in my blood went quiet, cowed by the power of our protection.

We fortified the entire village by morning. More villages requested our help. For one brilliant week, it seemed like we'd found the answer. The aswang couldn't breach our walls. Couldn't take any more victims. Couldn't spread their corruption.

I should have known it was too easy.

The truth came from one of our youngest patients – a four-year-old boy we thought we'd successfully turned back. He was almost completely human again, his transformation reversed, when he looked at me with suddenly ancient eyes.

"Big sister Susannah says thank you," he whispered. "The wards are exactly what she needed."

Too late, I understood. We'd created a network of powered barriers throughout the region, all of them containing traces of my transformed blood. Blood that was still connected to Susannah, still sang with her corruption.

We'd built them a web. A circuit. A way to channel power like they'd never had before.

The wards exploded at midnight. Not just at our healing house, but everywhere we'd placed them. The blast transformed everyone within a hundred-foot radius instantly. The lucky ones died. The rest... the rest became something new.

I watched in horror as reality tore open, as people I'd tried to help morphed into geometric impossibilities. Saw Maria's face as she realized what we'd done – what I'd done. My blood. My corruption. Our arrogance.

"You helped us create something beautiful," Susannah's voice echoed from everywhere and nowhere. Her new form stepped through a tear in space-time, more magnificent and terrible than ever. "You helped us reshape the world."

I tried to fight as she approached, but my body recognized its maker. My blood sang to her. The monster inside me rejoiced at her touch.

"Look," she commanded, turning my face toward the village.

I looked. God help me, I looked.

The world was transforming. Reality buckled and shifted. Humans became monsters became abstract concepts became hungry gods. Children walked on ceilings, their bodies bent backward, their laughing mouths full of universes. The sky had teeth. The ground had wings.

I'd helped cause this. My blood had made it possible.

"The old world is ending," Susannah purred. "And you're going to help us birth the new one."

I broke. Ran. Kept running until I collapsed in the ruins of the church, where Father Santiago's body was busy turning itself inside out.

That's where Maria found me, hours later. She was bleeding from wounds that didn't obey physical laws, but she was alive. Still human.

"Lola Rosa," I managed to ask.

"Alive. Badly hurt. But she knows what we did wrong." Maria knelt beside me, her eyes fierce despite her injuries. "More importantly, she knows how to fix it."

"How? The world is literally falling apart. Reality is-"

"Breaking. Yes. But that means all the rules are breaking." She grabbed my shoulders. "Including the rules that make aswang what they are."

Hope. Tiny, fragile, but real.

"There's more," she said. "We found my grandfather's last journal. The one they thought they'd destroyed. It tells us exactly what they are. What they're becoming. How to stop them."

Above us, the toothed sky gnawed on the moon. Around us, the transformed village screamed with new and hungry voices. Inside me, the monster stirred, eager to join the chaos.

But for the first time since the wards broke, I felt something else.

Purpose.

"Tell me what we need to do," I said.

The world was ending. Reality was breaking.

But maybe that meant we could reshape it too.
