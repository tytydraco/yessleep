Part 5 [here](https://www.reddit.com/u/Screwlost/s/DCHR2hhVkY)

I woke up with blood on my hands and no memory of the night before. Not an unusual occurrence lately, except this time the blood wasn't mine. And there were fragments of something soft caught under my fingernails.

"You were sleepwalking again," Maria said, her voice carefully neutral as she helped me clean up. "We found you at the ward boundaries. You were... eating something."

The taste in my mouth confirmed my worst fears. Sweet. Fresh. Young.

"Did I..."

"No children are missing from the village," she assured me quickly. "We think it was a cat. Or at least, we hope it was a cat."

The transformations were getting harder to control. Despite Lola Rosa's herbs, despite the protective amulets, despite my own desperate will to resist, the monster was winning. Last week, I'd caught myself crafting a lure from hair and blood – an aswang hunting charm. Yesterday, Maria found me teaching a young patient how to split his tongue.

"Your body remembers what it almost became," Lola Rosa said, forcing more bitter herbs down my throat. "And Susannah's family... they're doing something. Getting stronger. The barriers between human and monster are thinning."

She was right. The attacks had changed. No longer content with isolated feedings, the aswang were transforming entire families. Children would go to school normal and come home with hollow bones. Parents would wake up with their organs rearranged, their tongues already forked.

Father Santiago reported seven infant disappearances in one night. "They're not eating them anymore," he said, his face grey. "They're... changing them. Keeping them alive. Building an army."

The partially transformed boy we'd tried to save escaped our care. We found him two days later, leading other children into the forest at sunset. His tongue had fully split, and when he smiled, his teeth went all the way back into his throat.

"Big sister Susannah says it's time," he told us in that horrible double-voice. "The old ways are ending. A new hunger is rising."

That night, I dreamed of flying. Not the usual nightmare of transformation, but something worse – a memory. I was with Susannah, high above the clouds, our wings brushing. Below us, a village slept.

"Watch," she whispered, her beautiful face shifting into something ancient and terrible. "I'll teach you how to make them ripen."

I watched as she cast something down – a charm made of bone and hair, eerily similar to the one I'd caught myself crafting. Where it landed, children began to cry. Parents thrashed in their sleep. Something dark took root in their dreams.

"Fear makes the meat sweeter," she explained. "But terror... terror makes them transform better."

I woke screaming, my tongue fully extended, tasting the air for prey. Maria found me trying to crawl out the window, my back split halfway open, embryonic wings pushing through the skin.

"It's getting worse," she said as she helped Lola Rosa force-feed me purifying herbs. "They're doing something to accelerate the change. Not just in you, but in everyone they've tainted."

The evidence was everywhere. Our healing house was overwhelmed with victims, their transformations more aggressive than anything we'd seen before. They arrived human and turned within hours, their bodies twisting into new horrors.

A mother brought in her twin infants, both already showing signs of the change. As Lola Rosa examined them, one baby's tongue shot out, wrapped around its sibling's throat. The other baby laughed – a sound no infant should make.

"You can't save them all," Susannah's voice called that night as wings darkened the sky above our house. "You can barely save yourself. I can smell your hunger, love. Smell the changes you're trying so hard to fight."

She was right. The hunger was constant now, maddening. I caught myself watching Maria when she slept, imagining how easy it would be to split her open, to taste her mortality. Sometimes I woke up with my teeth in my own flesh, trying to feed on myself.

The worst part was how good it felt when I gave in even slightly. Every small surrender brought a rush of pleasure, a sense of rightness. The monster in my blood sang with joy each time I slipped.

"It's normal," said our newest patient – a middle-aged man fighting his own transformation. "The hunger... it feels like coming home."

I recognized him from Mrs. Reyes's descriptions of recent attacks. He'd been one of Susannah's latest victims. But something was different about his transformation.

"She's learned new tricks," he told us, his skin rippling with partial changes. "New ways to spread the curse. It's not just about feeding anymore. They want to transform everyone. Make a world where they don't have to hide."

That night, Maria showed me more of her grandfather's journals. The latest entries, written just before his death, spoke of an ancient prophecy.

"When the old blood finds new ways to spread, when the hungry ones walk in daylight, when children birth monsters and monsters birth worlds... then comes the time of choosing. Then comes the war that ends all wars."

"What does it mean?" I asked.

"It means they're not just hunting anymore. They're evolving. Transforming not just bodies, but reality itself." She turned to a page filled with sketches of anatomically impossible creatures. "These were his last drawings. The things he saw them becoming."

I recognized some of the forms. They'd been appearing in my dreams. In my own partial transformations.

The next day, three more children disappeared from the village school. We found them at sunset, standing in a circle in the town square. Their bodies were changing, but not into any form we'd seen before. They were becoming something new. Something that shouldn't exist.

Above them, Susannah perched on the church spire, her own form shifted into something that hurt my eyes to look at. Wings sprouted from wings. Mouths opened within mouths. Reality bent around her like a fever dream.

"The old ways are dying," she called down to me. "The world is hungry for change. Join us willingly, or watch everyone you try to save become something glorious and terrible."

That night, as I helped Lola Rosa tend to our increasingly monstrous patients, I felt something crack inside me. Not my bones this time, but something deeper. My reflection in the window showed my eyes changing – not just the color, but the shape. The number.

"We're running out of time," Maria said, watching me struggle to maintain my human form. "They're planning something big. Something soon."

In the distance, wings blotted out the moon. But they weren't normal wings anymore. They were something new, something that existed in more dimensions than our world was meant to hold.

The war was coming. But it wouldn't be the war we'd trained for.

This would be a war for reality itself.

And I was still transforming, still hungry, still dreaming of Susannah's kiss.

Still wondering if fighting the change was the right choice after all.
