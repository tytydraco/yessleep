I'm a middle-aged guy working a boring 9-5 job. Its the most boring job in the world. The job of an accountant. I work in a great bank. But it doesn't matter so much to me because it helps me to pay the bills. 

I've never fit anywhere. I fit into the shy, awkward, nerd category. I may or may not go so far to say that I'm unattractive, but women always love to avoid me like the plague.

So, imagine my surprise when a very attractive woman took an interest to me in my cousin's wedding. It started out great and oddly enough that our vibe matched and even our likes, dislikes, and hobbies. 

I took one look at her and felt something I haven't felt for years. It was totally love at first sight. I thought she liked me too. As we talked more and more, I became more and more fascinated by her. I also felt a little light-headed. 

The edges of my vision started to blur. When I told her that I wasn't feeling so well and wanted to call it a night, she insisted to come with me to my room. I reluctantly agreed as I had trust issues. 

Also, no woman ever wanted to spend a night with me, so there was that. When we entered the room my cousin let me stay for the night, I turned on the corridor light. "No please, turn it off, please!" I heard her squeal. 

We did everything in the dark. I distinctly remember the little nibbles (almost like tickles) that I felt when she was making love to me. It even got weirder when I started to notice these weird round spots that began to appear on my legs. 

Then they turned into huge and painful pus-filled boils. They slowly started to spread until they left these huge scabby holes on the skin of my legs. My GP diagnosed it as an unusually strong drug-resistant strain of Necrotizing fasciitis(flesh-eating bacteria). 

In the meantime, my doctors continued to give me loads of antibiotics but none worked. The condition of my legs gradually worsened. I wondered where she was. As I lay there on the hospital bed, being fed and medicated through IV, my sedatives kicking in, I saw her casually walk in. 

"H--Hi..!" I muttered, struggling to stay awake. There was something very different about her face. She smiled at me, displaying sharp and narrow piranha teeth. My eyes widened in shock. She put her mouth close to my ears and whispered,"So sorry about your legs, but I enjoyed my time with you..."

"You smelled so good that I couldn't resist... Your meat was the best thing that I've ever tasted so far. When I bit you, the poison from my teeth, got into your skin. But I didn't want this to happen to you. Anyway, I hope you missed me, because I am not done with you!" Then I heard her chuckle. Suddenly, the light in my room went out and I fekt this tickling sensation all over my face and torso. 

"You can't get away from this..." I whispered. I heard her laugh. "Oh honey, I've been getting away with it for centuries even before you were born. No man can resist me!" She breathed into my ear. 

And I knew that I wasn't going to be alive for much longer. I didn't know what she was and where did she come from. But I knew that I will take her deadly secret with me to the grave. Maybe she was the monster created by the sins of men.
