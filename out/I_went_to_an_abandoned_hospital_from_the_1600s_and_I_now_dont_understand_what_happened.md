I was just sitting in my car, sick out of my mind.

I was coughing, sneezing and felt like throwing up four times.

My head was hurting a lot and I got news that I had stage 1 lung cancer and my wife died a couple of years ago.

I took out a cigarette and lit it and I tried just like old times but I ended up coughing blood and wheezing almost immediately.

I wanted to do some stuff before I die just like my wife did.

I called a friend of mine and he said:

“Marcus. Why not you go to this abandoned place? I’ll send you the location in a bit.”

I check in messages and I see the place, not that far from the city.

Perfect… or so I thought.

After a few minutes of driving I stop at the place and it looked like a hospital.

“What happened to this place? Looks very rusty.”

I get my flashlight and I walk to the door, once I reached the door I look at the knob, unsure if I should turn it or not.

Then I place my hand on the cool, rusty knob.

Twist it.

And I enter where everything looks damaged.

Everything rusted and the building looks like it collapsed multiple times.

I walked around until I heard a sound of surgical instruments sliding and hitting something.

I go to check where the sound is and there I see a tall black figurine that is sharpening the scalpel and fixing it.

I tried to leave but I accidentally creaked the door and when he turned, I saw his pale rusty tan face and he looked at me and said:

“Hello Mr. Andres. Please have a seat in the chair.”

I look at him and say:

“How the fuck do you know my name?!”

It doesn’t respond.

It stares at me.. its eyes filled with nothingness.

I sit down on the chair and he gets his scalpel and before I even say anything, he starts the operation.

I was wide awake and I thought I would feel the worst pain imaginable, a knife cutting through my bare skin.

But when he started cutting, I felt nothing.

No pain and no discomfort whatsoever.

The thing operated on me and looked at my organs and he looked at my lungs and he looks at me and he injects something in my lungs and then after he’s done he stitched me up.

He looks at me and extends his closed hand and says:

“Do you want a lollipop?”

Then he opens his hand and a lollipop is just sitting on his palm as if it was there before.

“N- No thank you sir..”

It looks at me, closes its hand and opens it again and this time showing a wooden toy train and he asked again if I wanted it and I again said no.

Then he closes his hand and he points to the exit and politely tells me that the exit is there and that I should leave since there are “other patients”.

I nod and I get up from the chair and walk to the door and when I opened it I saw the outside world.

I look back and the doctor is waving at me before the door slams shut near my face.

I just go back to the car and ask myself:

“What the hell just happened?”

But if there’s one thing I’ll tell you.

You must visit this doctor.
