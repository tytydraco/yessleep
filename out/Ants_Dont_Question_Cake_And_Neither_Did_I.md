I was at my niece’s birthday party. It was on a big boat. A fancy one, with too many shiny things, too many rich people. The Amazon River stretched out for miles and miles. You couldn’t see the end of it, and the water was dark. I could hear it slapping against the side of the boat. The air smelled like wet wood and fish.

The guests were laughing too loud. I didn’t want to be there, but my sister had begged me to come. My niece was running around in her little dress, playing with balloons. She didn’t know how strange everything felt. She didn’t know how out of place I felt.

The pink dolphins came up near the boat. I don’t think anyone else noticed. They were beautiful, but they looked wrong, like something that didn’t belong there. They kept circling the boat, their long fins cutting through the murky water. But no one cared. They just kept drinking and laughing, talking too much, acting like they knew everything. I could see them all through the glass of my drink.

The man they hired to help with the food was standing at the edge of the boat, carrying trays of snacks. He was a local. His hands were shaking. I noticed him before anyone else did. I think he was nervous. Maybe it was the way the guests were talking to him. They were being too loud, too friendly in a way that didn’t feel right.

Then, someone—I don’t even know who—grabbed him. It happened fast. One second he was walking, and the next he was over the edge of the boat. He didn’t scream. It was like they didn’t even care that he was there. They just tossed him into the water, like he was nothing. I couldn’t see him anymore after that. Just the bubbles rising to the surface. I don’t know why, but I couldn’t look away.

Everyone was still laughing. No one seemed to care. And the pink dolphins… they were still swimming near the boat, but now they weren’t beautiful anymore. They were waiting. I swear they were waiting.

I couldn’t just stand there. I had to say something. I didn’t care if it was awkward. I didn’t care about the stupid party anymore. I turned to the people around me, my voice shaking. “What just happened? Why did you—why did you throw him overboard?”

They all looked at me, like they didn’t even understand what I was asking. One of the men, his face red from too much wine, waved a hand and laughed. “Oh, relax. He’s fine. He was just being dramatic.”

“Dramatic?” I was yelling now. “He’s in the river! He’s going to drown!”

Another woman—she was wearing a big hat—shrugged like it was nothing. “He was saying the dolphins were bad luck. He kept going on about how we were all doomed. The man needed to cool off. It’s not a big deal.”

I stared at them, my mind racing. I couldn’t make sense of any of it. They were all so calm, like throwing someone into a river was the normal thing to do when they were annoying.

I didn’t know what else to do, so I grabbed the life preserver from the deck. I threw it over the side, hoping, praying he'd grab it. I waited for him to surface. But there was nothing. Nothing but the dark water and the ripples that spread out, getting smaller and smaller. I stood there, frozen. The river was so still now. Too still.

My heart was racing. I couldn’t breathe. I kept thinking about the dolphins—how they were still circling, still waiting, like they knew what was going to happen. The bubbles from the man’s body were still rising, but they were slowing down.

“He’s dead,” I whispered. My mouth felt dry, but the words wouldn’t stop. “He’s dead. You killed him!”

That’s when they all turned on me. They grabbed my arms, and I didn’t know what was happening. They were shouting at me to calm down. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t stop shaking, and I couldn’t stop crying.

“Get her below deck!” someone yelled. “She’s ruining the party.”

I didn’t even fight them. I was so scared, I let them drag me away, down the stairs, into the dark. I couldn’t stop looking out the little portholes as they pushed me lower and lower. The boat felt too big, too empty. I felt like I was sinking too.

I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t. I was trapped. And the worst part? I could still hear the laughter from above. It was like nothing had changed.

The party didn’t stop. They kept drinking and laughing, oblivious. The sun started setting, and the sky turned red, casting strange shadows on the water. I could hear the music from the deck, the clinking of glasses. It all felt far away. Like it wasn’t real.

Then they brought my niece below deck. Her face was covered in cake, her little hands sticky. She was tired, too tired to play anymore. She was quiet, her eyes half-closed, like she wanted to be anywhere but here.

My sister, her face flushed from too much wine, handed her over to me without a word. I didn’t say anything either. I just held my niece close. She was warm against me, and her breath was soft, like everything was normal. I tried to pretend that everything was normal too.

But it wasn’t.

I couldn’t stop thinking about what happened. About the man in the water. About the dolphins. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. But when I looked at my niece, I tried to push it all away. She needed me. I had to protect her.

I held her tight, and I closed my eyes for a moment, just to rest. I must’ve drifted off.

When I woke up, the boat was shaking. It lurched so hard I nearly dropped her. I gasped, looking around. The whole boat was tilting. My heart pounded in my chest. I rushed to the porthole, pressing my face against the cold glass. We were stuck. The boat had drifted across the river.

It wasn’t the water that made me feel sick. It was the silence.

The laughter from above had stopped. The music had stopped. The talking was gone. There was nothing but the sound of the water, slapping against the boat.

I waited. I didn’t know what to wait for, but I knew something was coming. Something bad.

And then I heard it. The quiet. It was too quiet. There were no more birds, no more insects. The forest on the shore was silent. I felt a chill creep up my spine.

My niece stirred in my arms, but I didn’t move. I couldn’t. I just listened, feeling a wave of fear rise in my chest. I couldn’t explain it, but I knew, deep down, that something was wrong. That we were not alone.

Something was out there, in the dark.

Suddenly, there was noise from above. Scrambling. Shouting. The kind of shouting you hear when people are afraid. Real fear. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest as I clutched my niece tighter, my breath coming in short gasps.

Then, the screams. People were shrieking. Panicked, frightened screams. I could hear them yelling things—half words, half sobs. "They’re on the boat!"

I didn’t understand what that meant. I wanted to. I needed to. But all I could do was sit there, feeling the air grow colder. My hands were shaking. My niece whimpered in my arms, but I couldn’t comfort her. I couldn’t even breathe.

The chaos above grew louder. I could hear feet pounding across the deck, the sound of bodies slamming into walls. And then... then I heard it—the sound of people jumping.

They were jumping overboard. One by one. Screaming as they fell into the water. I heard their voices cut off abruptly, replaced by the sound of agony, of pain. I could almost *feel* it—like something was tearing through them. The shrieks… the sounds they made… they weren’t like any screams I’d ever heard before.

And then—*then*—I heard something else. A sound that froze me in place.

It was skittering. Fast, like legs—many legs—scrambling across the deck. Then more rustling. Like something huge, something with wings, moving between the walls above us. The sound was almost too much to process, too frantic. It was everywhere.

I couldn’t breathe. The panic that filled me felt like it was choking me. I could feel it in my chest, in my throat. The hatch above us—the big, thick hatch—was the only thing between us and whatever was up there. I wanted to scream, but the only thing I could hear was that noise.

Insect-like chittering.

The sound was muffled by the hatch, but it was clear. It was so clear. I could almost picture it—huge, clicking mandibles, something waiting just above, just beyond reach. It was *coming*.

I couldn’t make sense of anything. My heart was racing. My hands were sweating. I looked down at my niece, who was now shaking in my arms, her face pale, her tiny hands clutching at my shirt. She felt as terrified as I did.

And then I realized—*we were trapped*.

I had to protect her. I had to get us out. But there was nowhere to go.

"Aunt Miri?" Sissy stammered. I just held her and hushed her.

Somehow, the noise ended, like we were passed over by whatever had come aboard. No more screams. We just sat there until morning, in an eternity.

I somehow remembered the book I had gotten Sissy for her birthday, and recited it to her.

The Ants And The Grasshopper

I told her the story again and again, trying to make the night of horror end.

When we heard the approach of the launch, and them saying into a megaphone: "Czy ktoś żyje?" and then "¿Hay alguien vivo?"

With a feeling of trepidation, I opened the hatch. There was blood all over the deck and skeletal remains of several people who didn't make it into the water. Amid the carnage there were bottles and glasses and pieces of trampled birthday cake. I stared, and saw a few large ants, bigger than any I'd ever seen, with sabertoothed mandibles and wings, left for dead as folded dark blotches amid the colorful mess.

I climbed out, seeing that the swarm was gone. I saw the forest, stripped bare, dead animals amid the naked trees. I saw the men on the launch, staring at me in disbelief. They were very surprised to find any survivors. I covered Sissy's eyes and we were helped down from the yacht into the launch.

"You are Americans? English?" I was asked. I nodded, shaking and traumatized.

I just held Sissy and one of the men covered us in a blanket, as we were shivering and needed the feeling of security. He tried to smile at us and said something that the other man translated:

"He says you are very lucky, that these ants come from a broken seal, a valley forbidden. No forestry, all the lumbermen are gone. Whole villages destroyed. How do you feel so lucky?"

"We're just grasshoppers." Sissy said. Then to me she asked: "Are you going to be my mommy now, Aunt Miri?" to which I hugged her close and said:

"Yes baby, I've got you."
