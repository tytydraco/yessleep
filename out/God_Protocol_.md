I never should have taken the job. But when the war ended and the opportunity came to work with them, how could I resist? The world was fractured, burned, starving. The ones who controlled power and knowledge controlled survival. And they controlled both.

When Aeon approached one hundred scientists from different fields after the Fifth World War, we found ourselves unable to decline the opportunity. They had come knocking at our doors, and I knew who they were immediately. Over their chests, their spiral insignias marked them—symbols that carried weight far beyond mere decoration. They didn’t need to wield guns or threats for people to understand their power. They wore black suits, like something pulled from those Men in Black movies from decades ago—imposing, clean, timeless.

I took the job, seeing as I didn’t have any work after the war. There wasn’t much work for anyone anymore. Corporations had grown larger, stronger, and normal people had shrunk—literally. The middle class was easily distinguishable now because we looked like walking skeletons, starved half to death. The job offer felt like a gift from God, a lifeline amidst the ruin.

The Aeon Research Center was buried beneath layers of reinforced steel, miles of earth, and the constant, omnipresent hum of generators. Its walls felt as though they were alive, alive with secrets, with machines, with power. The kind of people who ran Aeon operated outside of politics, wars, or even morality. They had one goal: control.

It was at Aeon that we learned they had found something. Something at the bottom of the ocean. Something buried beneath the pressure of the deep, ancient darkness. And this wasn’t just any discovery. This was a discovery that would shake the foundations of humanity itself.

It came to us in fragments at first. Large pieces of material unlike anything humans had encountered before. The kind of material that made us stop, stare, and scratch our heads in disbelief. Testing revealed it to be more durable than any known compound—impervious, even, to heat, pressure, and time itself. Its surface shimmered with an otherworldly, metallic sheen that refracted light in strange, almost unnatural ways. It was perfectly smooth, seemingly without flaw or imperfection. And the material was very very very old.

But those pieces were tiny. Mere fragments. The real discovery lay at the bottom of the ocean—a massive, ancient container. Pandora’s Box, as we had come to call it. A name far more fitting than we knew.

The container was in remarkably good conditions. Not beautiful, not remarkable considering whats its withstood, soon its very existence would be enough to send chills down our spines. It had been made from the same unearthly material as the fragments, something that defied logic and time, resisting rust, corrosion, entropy itself.

When we breached the outer chamber, we found something strange. At the very bottom of the container’s entryway was a familiar mark—a spiral insignia. The Aeon logo. At first, we didn’t understand it. How could this be? How could a container at the bottom of the ocean, from billions of years ago, bear the Aeon insignia? Could it be a mere coincidence? How was it carved into the material? But upon closer examination, we discovered it wasn’t isolated. The logo was everywhere, marking the container, its walls, and its depths.

Aeon Property.

That phrase was written in small, cold letters at the base of the container’s door. We didn’t understand it then, but we would learn that this was the least important discovery we’d ever make about Pandora’s Box.

Inside Pandora’s Box, we found something that sent us spiraling into madness: a message. Not just a note or a written statement, but a prophecy. A warning carved into the walls, put there by some unknown hand. And it wasn’t made by Aeon, at least not the Aeon from now. It came from a different Aeon—a future Aeon. Or at leas that was what the date implied at the beginning of the writing. January 1st 2120, 12 months into the future. It was like something you’d read on conspiracy forums on some corner of the internet.

The writing on the walls quickly painted a grim image. In the future Earth had been pushed far past the point of flexibility, the natural boundaries of life and time. Soon, all life would cease. The planet would no longer be able to sustain humanity, nor its counterparts in the natural world. And when that time came, we would have one solution, one singular, unalterable course of action:

We had to send back living organic molecules to 3.8 billion years ago.

The writings explained that natural processes had never created organic molecules in Earth’s oceans. No natural synthesis had spurred the origin of life. Instead, this very container—the Pandora’s Box—had held them. These organic molecules, embedded in the deepest recesses of the Earth’s origin, would seed life itself. Through this box, they would ensure the origin of the first organic molecules, a calculated intervention from the future.  That’s why this box was at the bottom of the ocean. Because it was on Earth when all there was had been ocean. This Earth was the beginning of Life on Earth. 

We struggled with this message. We questioned whether this could even be real. Was this some kind of elaborate hoax? Yet, the evidence was undeniable. Scientists became sick as they poured over the text, reading it again and again. Many shut down entirely—physically, mentally, unable to cope with the implications. They fell into a catatonic state, by the time things settled down there couldn’t have been more than 20 of us. 

The writings continued, dark and ominous. The box’s programming was simple, and specific: it would send the organic molecules back to 3.8 billion years ago, to the beginning of life itself. And now it was our turn. To make sure that humanity wasn’t wiped from time completely. We had to take the same measures. The message explained that activating the box would ensure our survival, but at the cost of our present existence. The entire Earth would be erased, wiped out in an instant when Pandora’s box exerts an overwhelming amount of energy. We would feel nothing, know nothing, not even a moment of pain. It would simply happen, a finality so absolute that it would feel like waking from a dream.

The final line of the text haunted me:

It was signed. My name. My name.

I felt my stomach twist. Somehow, me, or a version of me, had helped to make this thing. 

We held a dozen meetings that same week, deliberating over the implications of what we had found. Questions consumed us. Could we believe the writings? Could we trust this message? What would happen if we followed the instructions? Would Earth simply vanish? And if we didn’t—if we chose to ignore the message—would humanity be wiped from reality? A blank void in time, erased entirely?

We voted. High-ranking members of Aeon and the remaining scientists. The vote was close—51 to 49. The decision was to proceed with God Protocol.

Those who opposed the decision began to leave, terrified of what this meant. We called it God Protocol. Ensuring the preservation of mankind… or that’s what we told ourselves to cope.

The writings in Pandora’s Box stipulated that the activation should happen on the date mentioned: January 1st, 2120. Now, there is one month left. I find myself lying awake at night, wondering if I could change this, if there is some other way.

What if we weren’t meant to exist? What if this was never supposed to happen?

Questions keep me up at night. What happens if I follow this protocol, knowing that another me will repeat the same actions again and again? Will we become trapped in this cycle forever? I can’t stop asking.

And yet… what choice do I have?

Time feels short. My mind feels fractured. My body feels as if it is coming apart under the weight of this discovery. I know how much time I have left.

And I know this: when I push the button, the Earth will end.
