My brother and I have always had a good relationship. Since we were kids, he and I bonded over videogames and wrestling. Those were some of the best years of my life. But, alas, we both grew up and had our own lives to live. 

He has a job that means he has to travel from time to time. He doesn't go into details so I don't exactly know the specifics. He always seemed so uneasy when we asked. I used to joke about him having a secret wrestling career which seemed to lighten the mood. 

A few years ago, he asked me to look after his house while I was away. I'd just come out of college and he was willing to pay be $1000 for just one week. So of course I accepted. A part of him seemed reluctant to give me the keys so I assured him I wouldn't have any parties and trash the place. He smiled slightly and handed me the keys before hugging my tighter than he ever had before.

The first two days were fine. I'd sleep in a huge bed with pillows that felt like clouds and wake up to the sound of one of the neighbours working on their garden. Their garden was beautiful and ge was too. He had chocolate brown hair that slightly covered one of his eyes. His eyes in general were a sight. The most amazing shade of green. His body wasn't bad either. At one point I swore he looked up at me and smiled. But he didn't talk to me until the third day of my stay. 

He knocked on the door and introduced himself as Damien. I felt at peace in that moment. Like he was a good person to be around. Things continued on and during the rest of my stay, he and I would talk and go on dates. I felt like I'd known him for years. He explained he was a good friend of my brother's and actually told me he was my brother's boss. He said that the job was like a delivery service which required him to go away from time to time. It sounded like a scam but I couldn't believe it was coming from someone like him. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt. 

My brother came home after the week and he asked me some questions. He still seemed so uneasy and I couldn't understand why. I explained how I'd gotten on really well with his friend Damien. His eyes seemed to widen more and I thought it was just him being a normal brother. 

Years went by and I married Damien. Everyone was surprised that I'd managed to get someone so kind and handsome. Damien would always lie and say others say the same to him. My marriage with him seemed perfect but I noticed that day by day, Damien would become more clingy and attached to me. Sometimes I felt like his food source. Like he needed my love to survive. I would fall asleep to his loving green eyes staring at me and wake up to those same green eyes. 

My brother kept that same look of unease whenever I saw him. Especially when Damien was with me. It was like he saw what I saw. The hunger in those green eyes. 

After a while, my brother quit his job with him and  moved away. I asked both of them if something had happened and they said no. From then on, Damien seemed to fet worse. Everywhere I went, he was there. Watching me. Making sure I was okay. I was never alone. 

I came clean to one of my friends and she offered to take me on a small trip which I agreed to. I didn't pack any bags and borrowed some from my friend's clothes so I knew that he wouldn't be able to follow me as easy. I sent him a message explaining what was going on so he wouldn't worry. 

Luckily. My plan worked. I had an amazing time and being alone for a bit really helped. It was when I returned home that things took a...turn.

Something about our house seemed so off to me. But I knew I had to go inside. Part of me missed Damien and he love he gave me. I opened the door and turned on the light. My name was scratched across the walls, furniture was everywhere and my heart sunk into my stomach. I searched the house and finally came to our bedroom, the door slightly ajar. 

I saw Damien. Wrapped in a nest of my clothes. He slowly turned to face me and he smiled a toothy smile. As he started to get up, something in me told me to run. I heard booming footsteps behind me and his croaky voice calling my name. 

I came out of the door and saw my brother in a car waiting for me. I quickly hopped in and he tried to drive away but Damien came to my side of the car. He clung onto me as my brother drove the car. He swerved the car, trying to get Damien off of me but in the end, all three of us crashed. 

I woke up inside a hospital beside Damien and my brother. The doctor said that I was lucky I hadn't lost some of my memory like the other two had. I remembered every piece of that night. Both of them woke up and seemed so normal. Damien still loved me but it was tame and he didn't seem insane. My brother. Forgot who Damien was but remembered me.

My injuries healed before the two of them and I sold our house after covering any traces of what happened. Damien and I have had a happy marriage since then. But sometimes. In the corner of my eye. I swear to God I see those green eyes and that wide, toothy smile...
