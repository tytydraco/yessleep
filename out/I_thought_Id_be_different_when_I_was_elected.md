"I'm not going to be like the others"

That was how I ended every campaign speech when I was running for congress. Many people, including Chuck, my campaign manager would poke fun and laugh when I said that. "Sure you aren't", "Give it a Week", "That's what they all say until that first questionable donation comes in". But I meant it, and I think the voters could tell I meant it.

When I, as a 28 year old won my crowded primary and then in November the general election, I felt vindicated. My winning was proof that sometimes the Republic works, Democracy works, and someone who's not just a bought and paid for puppet for lobbyists.

The time between winning the election and being sworn in is like a blur. When you win a race, especially when its an upset race nobody thought you would win, you feel have everyone and their mother lining up to kiss the ring and try to apologetically beg for influence. Not to mention? The party had to get me prepped to actually be a congressman. We had to set up my office in district, get me up to date on what the party was doing. All of this was pretty much what I expected.

The first mistake that I made was pretty much as soon as I got to Washington, about 2 weeks before being sworn in. ( I know... this is stupid... but after a year of working my ass off, just me and Chuck, door knocking and phone calls, I was exhausted) was when the party offered me a slate of staff for my office. The majority Whip said "Everyone on this list is pre-vetted and has the experience to help you hit the ground running". I knew while signing their papers that these staff would probably expect me to play the games all these politicians play, but they were in for a surprise, I really am not going to be like the others.

I met Michael in my office the day after that, he was a tall blonde gentleman, with noticeably perfect posture.
"You must be my chief of staff" I said.
He stood up from my desk and put out his hand gleefully. "Yes sir! We have a hand full of meetings to get you to today." He then handed me a paper, a schedule that had me working from the 5 AM news briefing to evening gatherings that stopped at 10 PM "I know this schedule is packed he said, but you have a lot to get through these next few days, we have a welcome gathering of freshman at 8 PM tonight but before that we have a meeting with a couple of key lobbyists I have a good relationship with. "

"I have to stop you right there" I spoke up. "I appreciate your getting this all together for me, but I ran on being different, I detest all of the backroom deals these lobbyists make, and when I say I'm going to be different, I mean it. 

Michael just grinned and assured me" don't worry, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Its not like tv, sure these folks all want you to pass bills in their interest, but it's not like they're handing you a briefcase full of money." I agreed to only meet with them as an introduction and made clear that I was not interested in any gifts or donations. I would come to find out, I was concerned about the wrong meeting.

The Freshman gathering was at a hotel across from the capital, it all felt terribly generic, suits and ties in one of those rented spaces with the pullout walls, they had those cocktails in those little plastic cups. The catering was done by hotel, the only reason I paid any attention at all to that was I found a couple of the waitresses to be attractive, and was kind of hoping to make conversation with the brunnete girl who was serving the drinks. The most striking thing was that it was bipartisan. It's funny, you see these guys tear each other apart on television, but the majority leader and minority leader were sitting at the same table and cracking jokes when just last week I was watching them on the news calling each other names that would get my post removed if I repeated them.

At about 9:30 I was looking to call it for the night, but Michael encouraged me to stay for the toast. One of the old senators stood up, the president pro-tempore, he had served his state since before I was born. I noticed that the staff switched out before they passed out the last round for the toast, the only reason I noticed at all was the brunnette girl was gone. The drinks they passed out were in the same little clear plastic cup, but instead of the punch from earlier, this appeared to be a thick red wine, it smelled like wine, bjt it's viscosity was way thicker, bjt it smelled okay. It wasn't until he toasted and I took a sip that I'd notice it tasted like wine mixed with iron.

I don't know what was in that drink, but I woke up st 5 AM in the next morning with a punding headache. I groggily got out of bed and ran to the restroom trying to remember the night before and count my drinks. When I stepped out again I noticed the hotel room was dark except the desk lamp was lite and a yellow manilla file folder sat on the table along with a headache powder and a steaming hot cup of coffee. A note was lying on top of the folder in incredibly precise and disciplined handwriting. It read "You're just like the others"
