[PART 3]

Fear shot through me, but it was quickly overshadowed by a desperate need for answers. What did he know? How did he know my name? What had happened to Justin and KC? "Who… who are you?" I stammered, my voice barely a croak.
A slow, deliberate smile stretched across his face, not the deranged grin of a madman, but the cold, calculated expression of a predator. 

"My name is Tony. And I am merely a messenger." He gestured vaguely down the street, towards the darker, more affluent outskirts of town. "Sterling sends his regards. He believes you have a part to play in a grand design, a destiny woven centuries ago."

My mind raced. Sterling??? 

"What about my friends?" I demanded, the words a raw ache in my throat. "Where are Justin and KC? And Sterling? Everyone said he was gone?"

Tony's smile didn't falter. "Patience. All will be revealed. Your friends are… part of the unfolding. Sterling understands your connection to this ancient power, a connection born of your very blood. He believes you are key to truly unlocking it, to bringing forth a new era." 

He extended a hand, surprisingly clean, a pale, almost phosphorescent glow emanating from beneath his ragged sleeve. "Come. Let us not keep destiny waiting."

Every fiber of my being screamed at me to run, but the morbid curiosity, the survivor's guilt, and the faint terrifying hope of finding Justin and KC gnawed at me. I took a shaky breath and, against all reason, followed him.

Tony led me away from the streets, deeper into the shadowed, tree lined roads that wound towards the wealthier, more secluded estates. The journey was silent, save for the crunch of gravel under our shoes. His presence was heavy and cold. After what felt like an eternity, we turned onto a private drive, flanked by towering, wrought iron gates. Beyond them, bathed in soft, indirect lighting, stood a sprawling mansion. Its pristine facade and manicured grounds were beautiful but foreboding. This wasn't the lair of a madman; it was the sanctuary of a king.

"Welcome," Tony said, his voice echoing slightly in the grand entrance hall, "to Sterling's domain."

Sterling waited for us in a cavernous study, dominated by a massive aquarium that took up an entire wall. Hundreds of exotic fish swam in hypnotic patterns, their vibrant colors muted by the room's lighting. 

Sterling himself was not the frantic, wheedling park owner I expected. He was impeccably dressed, his silver hair slicked back, his eyes gleaming with an unnerving intensity. 

"Tommy, my boy," he said, his voice smooth as polished stone. "A pleasure to finally meet you." He gestured to a plush leather armchair. "Please, sit. We have much to discuss about your… unique circumstances."

I sat, my eyes fixed on him, my hands clenching involuntarily on the armrests. "Where are my friends?" I repeated, my voice now firmer, fueled by a surge of anger.

Sterling smiled, a benevolent expression that sent shivers down my spine. "Your friends served a vital purpose. They were... offerings. A necessary part of Agwé Malé's reawakening." He leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees, his gaze unwavering. "You see, when I acquired that rather magnificent statue from Lac des Morts, I wasn't merely buying a prop. I was acquiring a key. A key to unimaginable power, to wealth, to influence beyond the dreams of mortal men."

He paused, a flicker of something almost ecstatic in his eyes. "The legends spoke of a binding, yes. A spirit contained. But what they failed to mention was the reciprocal nature of such an old magic. Agwé Malé, in its captivity, granted its captor certain... boons. Foresight. Control over certain probabilities. The ability to manipulate the lesser currents of the world. Money was a byproduct, Tommy. A triviality. What I sought was true control."

My stomach churned. He spoke of my friends as if they were nothing more than ingredients. "You made a deal with it? You let it take them?"

"A deal with an ancient entity, young Tommy, is never a simple transaction," Sterling corrected. "Agwé Malé required... sustenance. A steady flow of fear, of life force, to regain its strength within the statue. The park was ingenious, wasn't it? A constant supply of victims, unsuspecting riders, their terror feeding the Maw. But the binding, even with Lucille Thibodaux gone, was still too strong. It constrained Agwé Malé, prevented its true spread."
My blood ran cold. "Lucille... my great-great-grandmother."

"Indeed." Sterling picked up a remote, and a large screen descended from the ceiling, displaying old, grainy video footage. "Everyone assumed Lucille Thibodaux died after her ritual. A convenient myth to 
preserve the secrecy of her true sacrifice."

The screen flickered to a sepia-toned image of an old woman, her face weathered, her eyes tired. She was standing by a placid lake, her hands outstretched over the water. "Lucille didn't sacrifice her life, Tommy," Sterling continued. "She sacrificed her freedom. She became a living anchor through which Agwé Malé was tethered. Her life force, her very existence, was the chain that held the spirit in that lake. She lived a long, lonely life, a constant vigil, maintaining the binding until her natural death."

The screen shifted, showing a blurred, night-vision shot of the old water park. And then, a figure, obscured by shadow, moving through the empty facility. My eyes narrowed, and my breath hitched. 

"When I acquired the statue," Sterling explained, a hint of pride in his voice, "the binding was already weak, fraying after all these years. But it was still there. Agwé Malé could manifest, could feed, but it craved true liberation. That's where my son came into the equation. You, my son always shared my... Dark interests. We drifted apart for many years, only reuniting after he learned of my newest possession. He was the one who actually helped create the idea for The Maw. The apple really doesn't fall far from the tree, as they all say, Tommy."

The screen shifted, showing a blurred, night-vision shot of the old water park. And then, a figure, obscured by shadow, moving through the empty facility. My eyes narrowed, and my breath hitched when I saw who the shadow belonged to. 

Sterling's voice broke me out of my shocked stupor. "I believe you have already met him, though."

Movement to my left caught my attention. 

Oliver pushed from the shadows, dressed in a suit, mirrioring Sterling's suave aesthetic, his smile broadening, utterly devoid of anything but smug pride as he walked into the room. 

" Hey, buddy!" 

He slithered behind me, his cold hands resting on my shoulders as if I was an old friend. 

"I bet you're probably thinking what the fuck am I right?" 

I stared at him, not fully processing what I was learning. He brought his face close to my ear, his breath hot on my neck.

"Every shudder, every click, every 'disappearance' was a piece of the puzzle, Tommy. Each incident a morsel for the beast, and a thread in the web we spun to lure more. The internet cultivated the legend, Sterling spread the whispers. My reddit post was the bait. And the Maw... it did the rest. My story was brilliant, wasn't it?..... It obviously was because you, my friend..... You took it hook, line, and sinker!"

He pulled away, a condescending smirk on his face as he looked down at me. 

"We needed you afraid for this moment. We needed you terrified."

He let out a sick chuckle of amusement. 
 
"Did I do a good job, kid? You fucking petrified, yet?"

The anger flared, hot and sharp, but then I realized something. Oliver wasn't just a partner; he was marked too. There was a subtle vitality about him, an almost unnatural glow in his skin, a reflection of the same malevolent energy I had felt from Tony and the Maw itself.

"Facebook comments, tweets, blog posts... I was leaving bread crumbs all over social media, blabbering on about how traumatized I was. I played the part well... Shit, I had to! Do I really look like someone who would be working maintenance at a Goddamn water park, Tommy?" 

My silence was met with another cocky laugh that was laced with pride over his manipulative achievement as he brushed lint from the sleeve of his jacket. 

"But, it didn't take me." I finally managed. "Why didn't it take me? Was it because it didn't want your control?" I pressed with a tone of defiance as another wave of realization swept over me. 

"It didn't want to be your pawn, did it? It wanted a proper guardian of Lucille's bloodline. It used you to get to me, didn't it?"

Sterling's complacent smile vanished. His face contorted, a flush rising on his neck, and he stood towering over me, white hot rage in his eyes. "You brazen little shit! I control Agwé Malé! It requires a master! A guide! I have been its God, its provider for fucking years!" His voice rose, a sharp, angry bark. "And it knows it's fucking place! It brought you here for me!"

As Sterling's fury erupted, the air in the room grew suddenly thick. The fish in the aquarium behind him began to thrash violently, their movements frantic, desperate.

Then, with a sickening shatter, the entire wall of glass exploded inward, sending gallons of water cascading across the polished floor. The water then writhed, solidifying with terrifying speed. And from the churning depths, it formed.

First, the curve of a massive dorsal fin sliced through the surface. Then, the sleek, grey body, materialized. The Maw. Its eyes snapped open, now filled with a malevolent light that locked onto Sterling. Its jaws, still bearing that fucking grin, revealed it's rows upon rows of razor-sharp teeth. 

Sterling screamed, "No! I am your master! I COMMAND YOU!"

The water entity pulsed, and a voice, devoid of mercy, slammed into my mind, deafening in its silent scorn: 

"You called yourself master. You used my hunger for petty gain, for the hollow trappings of your world. You defiled the very purpose of my strength." 

Agwé Malé, in the terrifying guise of the great white, lunged across the water slicked floor. Its jaws clamped down on Sterling's torso with a sickening crunch of bone and tearing of flesh. Blood bloomed in the water around them, staining it a horrifying crimson. Sterling's legs kicked spastically, his hands clawing at the unyielding jaws. With a violent thrash of its tail, the shark flung Sterling against a marble pillar, the impact cracking it and leaving a gruesome smear. Then, it turned its attention to his head, its teeth sinking in with a wet, tearing sound, severing his screams. The water churned as jaws worked, reducing the once powerful Sterling to a mangled, unrecognizable mess.

Tony and Oliver, their faces masks of horror, stumbled backward, tripping over the debris and wet floor. But the Maw was relentless. It turned its eyes on Oliver, who let out a strangled cry, a sound choked with utter despair. The shark slid, an unnatural grace in its movements. It snapped at Oliver, its teeth tearing a chunk from his arm, sending a spray of blood across the white walls. Oliver fell, scrambling backward, but the Maw was upon him in an instant. It engulfed his head, a crack echoing through the room before it pulled back, leaving his lifeless body twitching on the floor.

Tony, surprisingly, seemed to accept his fate. He closed his eyes, an almost serene expression on his face. But Agwé Malé offered no swift end. The Maw lumbered towards him, its breathing wet and gutteral. It nudged him with its snout, then circled him once, savoring his terror, before its jaws closed around his neck, crushing his windpipe with a pop. It then proceeded to tear and rend his body, the once calm study now a scene of unimaginable carnage, awash in blood and viscera.

I was left alone, paralyzed by the raw power, the metallic tang of blood thick in the air. The monstrous shark, Agwé Malé in its terrifying physical form, turned its eyes on me. It lumbered towards me, the water receding as it moved, leaving glistening trails of blood. It stopped just a few feet away, its massive head looming over me.
Then, a voice, not spoken aloud, but vibrating through the very water in my body, clear as a bell, filled my mind: 

"Descendant of Lucille. You carry the old blood. She bound me, not knowing why I was forced into this hellish realm of captivity. But, you understand. You saw his foolishness. I was restrained by his will, forced to serve his base desires. He used my strength for power and wealth, when I could be so much more."

My breath hitched. "My friends," I whispered, my voice trembling, my eyes fixed on the dripping teeth. "Justin and KC?"

"They are here", Agwé Malé's silent voice resonated, the form remaining still, its gaze intense. 

"Agree to be my guardian, to guide my power, and they will be returned. And not only them. Anything you desire. Greatness. Influence. The power to right the wrongs of this world. I will be your will, made manifest. You will direct my power for good, the way it was destined. Allow me to complete the binding between us. A guardian, not a master. You will set me free to truly serve your noble intent as it was meant to be."

The offer was intoxicating. The chance to undo my mistake, to save my friends, to wield this terrifying power for something truly righteous. My survivor's guilt, a gnawing cavity in my chest, screamed for relief. This was it. This was my chance to make things right, to bring them back. To finally understand why I was spared. I pictured Justin's easy laugh, KC's smile, and the crushing weight of their absence. If this was the only way... It felt like destiny. My hand, still throbbing from the glass induced cuts, felt a strange, cold pull.

Yes," I managed, my voice hoarse.
"I'll do it."

The shark shimmered, its form momentarily flickering before the water in the room receded completely, leaving only the gore soaked remains of Sterling, Tony, and Oliver on the floor. A new surge of power, colder and deeper than before, slammed into me, not painful, but transformative. My blood burned, then chilled. My vision flared with flashes of the world's oceans, lakes, and rivers, all interconnected, all now pulsing with a terrifying, unified consciousness. I felt the very moisture in the air around me.
Then, the voice, now resonating with a terrifying, satisfied glee, filled my mind again: 

"Just as I intended Tommy. Lucille knew my true nature. She did not bind me to a master. She bound me to a vessel. And you, the last of her blood, you have severed that final tether. You have released me from the burden of needing a physical form, from any constraint. Now, I am truly free. Free to feed off the fear and souls wherever I wish, unbound by guardian or master. You were the final key."

My body felt weak, drained, but the revelation nearly killed me right then. I was the only one left in the study. I stumbled out of the mansion, my legs barely holding. I crawled my way out of the mansion, the sounds of unseen water surging and shifting within its walls echoing behind me.

I somehow made it back to my grandmother's house. I'm writing this now, my hands shaking so violently I can barely type. The cuts on my palms from the glass ache, not just with physical pain, but with a chill that seems to radiate in my veins. When the glass shattered, my blood and the water molded into one. I'm now bound to it all. 

Bound by blood. 

My reflection in the dark screen of my phone is not my own, the same as it was the night we entered the park, except it's not a glimpse anymore that vanishes when I look away. My eyes are too wide, and the corners of my mouth... they curl.

Agwé Malé has left its mark.

There is nothing more I can do. So, this is my final post. It's warning to everyone. Share this with your friends and family. Please. Don't let this slip through the cracks. 

The world is no longer ours. It belongs to the deep, to the currents, and to the unseen. And it is always, always watching. It hungers. And it waits.

I feel it. . A phantom chill when I step into the bathroom, the air gets so heavy. The quiet drip from the faucet sounds like a countdown, each drop a tiny, deliberate echo in the ancient mind that now brushes against my own. When I turn on the shower, the rushing water feels like a thousand unseen eyes, exploring, probing. And drinking. I can almost taste the subtle, metallic tang in every glass of water I pour, just a hint that wasn't there before. 

The deep hum from the pipes is no longer just plumbing; it's aa silent language spoken by something giant and patient, a presence that fills every reservoir, and every tear. It’s everywhere. 

It's in your home, too. It's in your body. It touches every drop, every single molecule of moisture. 

When was the last time you truly felt safe, standing naked beneath a stream of water with your eyes closed? When was the last time you drank a glass of water without a single thought of what might be dissolving within it? When was the last time you gazed into the surface of a pool, a puddle on the sidewalk, or the dark expanse of the ocean, without any dread crawling up your spine? Because I promise you, from this moment on, you will never be fully safe around water ever again, and it's my fault. Every splash, every drop.. could be The Maw. And it's already everywhere, inside you, waiting for you to get thirsty. Each time swimming through your subconscious, learning your fears, studying your thoughts, just biding it's time until it's ready. 

No... 

Until you're ready. Fuck, what I have done...

I'm sorry... 

God, I'm so fucking sorry...
