I don’t know when it started. Maybe it’s always been there—a small, lingering feeling, easy enough to ignore. But lately, I can’t stop thinking about my neighbor across the hall, and I can’t explain why. It’s like she’s a riptide pulling me out of my own life and into hers.

At first, it seemed harmless. I’d hear her keys jangling in the hall or catch her voice on the phone, and I’d feel this… pull. Just curiosity, right? Maybe a bit nosy. But I started looking forward to it, cataloging little details every time I saw her. Glancing out the peephole, waiting for a glimpse of her heading out, trying to guess her plans based on her outfit. I told myself I was just bored—maybe a little lonely. Just something to break up the monotony.

But then things started to get strange.

A couple of weeks ago, I noticed I was checking the locks before bed. Not just the front door, but every window, the sliding door on the balcony. It felt like caution at first, the kind that comes with living alone. But then I started doing it again. Twice. Three, four times. It was exhausting, but something felt wrong if I didn’t make sure. Like I was trying to lock something in—or maybe keep something out.

Last week, I started hiding things. Knives, especially. I know how that sounds. I hid some at the back of cabinets, others in drawers I never open. Wrapped the largest ones in dishrags, stuffed them inside cereal boxes. It felt… necessary. Like something terrible might happen if I didn’t.

As I went through my routine last night, a realization hit me: I was doing all of this for *her*. The locking, the hiding—I’d been telling myself it was to feel safe, but in the back of my mind, I started to think that I needed to know *she* was safe. *But that’s not my fucking business, is it?* She’s a grown woman; she can take care of herself. Yet the thought was there, relentless, the need to keep her safe pressing on my mind.

I’ve started watching for her more. Listening for her footsteps, her voice on the phone. Yesterday, I heard her talking to someone in the hallway, and before I knew it, I was pressing my ear to the door, catching every word. She was laughing, and suddenly I felt… relief. I don’t even know her, but hearing her laugh made the pressure in my chest ease, just for a moment.

This morning, as I left my apartment for groceries, I passed her in the stairwell. She was carrying a new blanket, one of those thick, plush throws made for winter. I don’t know what came over me, but I went out and bought the same one. I ripped it from its packaging, draped it over myself, and sat in the dark. I imagined her wrapped in the same blanket, both of us cocooned in the same fabric, feeling safe in its warmth. I felt ridiculous.

I just checked my locks again. Over and over, telling myself each time it would be the last, but the itch wouldn’t go away. Then I had a thought: what if *her* door wasn’t locked? *No, that’s crazy,* I told myself. *You will absolutely not check her door.* But the urge gnawed at me, this insistent need to know she was safe.

I was halfway into the hallway, my hand outstretched toward her door, when I heard a sound—a door creaking open below, footsteps climbing the stairs. My heart surged, and I bolted back inside, turning the lock so hard I nearly broke it.

I stood there, my back pressed against the door, staring down at my trembling hands, and I had one thought: I need to re-hide every single knife.
