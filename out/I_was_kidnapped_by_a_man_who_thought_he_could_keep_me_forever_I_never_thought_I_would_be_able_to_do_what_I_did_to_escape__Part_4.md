CW: Abusive Content

The days dragged on like years. Time became a cruel, meaningless construct, stretching and blurring until it was impossible to remember how long it had been since I last spoke to anyone. Even the memory of his voice had begun to fade, slipping away like everything else.

He’d begun leaving me alone more often, but never in a way that felt like relief or mercy. Each day, the rusted doors next to me would screech open, revealing a dumbwaiter he’d built into the wall. Every morning, it shuddered to life, its wooden frame rattling as it crept downward from whatever hellscape lay above me. It always stopped short with a dull thud, shaking violently as the doors rattled. Inside, there would be a single bottle of water, sometimes only half-full, along with a plate of scraps, seemingly from whatever he hadn’t finished from his dinner the night prior. Once the contents were removed, the doors would close, and the wooden frame would jolt upward, swallowed by the shadows between the walls.

The silence that followed mealtime was worse than his presence. Every slow groan of the house above me. Every uneven drip from the ceiling. It all felt like the breath before a scream. My nerves stayed wound so tight that the only thing I could hear amongst the oppressive silence was the quick, desperate thumping of my heartbeat in my ears.

The woman I’d met in the hallway was still there. I could hear her sometimes, her soft footsteps drifting through the corridors like something half-alive, half-forgotten, performing whatever menial tasks he had bound her to. I often wondered why she hadn’t tried to escape. What was so special about her that he let her walk around unshackled?

I didn’t know it at the time, but I wouldn’t have to wait long to get answers. I’d just woken up and once again settled into my little corner of hell for the day, praying that the man would forget about me, hoping he’d slip up and leave the door unlocked just once. To my dismay, the chains remained, the floor beneath me feeling more like a grave than a prison with each passing day.

It had become much harder to remember who I was, or even who I used to be. The girl who could walk down the street without looking over her shoulder, who had a good life, full of happiness and freedom, was now just a thing to him. A broken doll. Something he could project all of his dark fantasies onto.

In the middle of my loathing and self-pity, I heard a series of knocks reverberating through the room. Each one was slow and deliberate, as if the person behind them wanted to make sure I heard and acknowledged them all. They were followed by a silence that seemed gentler, kinder than I was used to, like the last words you hear from your mother before drifting off to sleep.

I had almost tricked myself into believing this would be something different, something better than what I had known it to be, but the belief quickly faded. The gentle caress of that thought was replaced by the same low chuckle that I knew so well, rising from behind the door.

My heart dropped as I began fighting the urge to tremble in fear. He need not have spoken to strike fear into me at that point. I watched as his dark shadow appeared from behind the wooden door.

“Time to play, Emily.” He said as he stepped inside the room with me.

I closed my eyes, trying to tame the silent storm raging within my head. His words stung, but there was no use in fighting. Not anymore. There was no way out of this.

I had barely eaten anything over the last few days, and my body was growing weaker. I knew I would have to sit there and take it, or risk him hurting me even worse.

I could feel the edges of my sanity slipping as he inched closer. I pulled together what mental strength I had left, readying myself for whatever he had planned.

As he made his way toward me through the dim light, I could see that he wasn’t alone this time.

A woman was with him… the same one I had spoken to before. Her eyes were wide and frantic. She didn’t even look at me as she stepped into the room behind him, choosing instead to stare at the walls around me. She was silent, not showing any outward emotion, but I could see it in her face. She was terrified.

The closer they both got to me, the more violently her body shook, as if I were the source of her fear.

“What’s happening?” I whispered, barely able to speak above the lump in my throat. “What’s going on?”

He pushed the woman toward me, and she stumbled, falling to her knees before me. Tears welled up in her eyes as she looked up at me. I could see that she was already covered in bruises, and her clothes were horribly torn and stained. Her face was gaunt, hollowed by exhaustion and fear. She didn’t look like the same person I’d seen days before.

“Emily,” she rasped, her voice cracking. “He’s... he’s changing things. Things are different now. He…”

She cut herself off, her breath coming in quick, ragged gasps. The tears that she had been holding back started to flow down her cheeks, as if she were finally releasing the pain she’d been carrying for so long.

I reached for her, desperate to know what was going on, desperate to help her, but she recoiled from my touch, fear exploding in her eyes.

“No... No, don’t touch me,” she whispered frantically. “Please. You don’t understand... He’s…”

Before she could finish, he took a step toward me and pressed his hand down on my shoulder. I felt his cold, hard grip squeezing tighter, setting the tone before he even said a word.

Once he had satisfied his sick, twisted lust for control, he crouched down beside me. He spoke with a soft, almost gentle tone as he leaned in, his breath hot against my ear.

“Well, now look what we have here,” he said, his voice smooth and mocking. “You’ve made a new friend, Emily. That’s good. You’ll need all the friends you can get for your next phase.”

His smooth, icy words melted across my mind, settling into panic. My heart pounded in my chest, flooding my body with adrenaline. I jerked my head away from him, desperate to put as much distance between us as possible.

“What are you talking about?” I asked, voice shaking. “Why are you doing this to us? Please, just let us go.”

He laughed in a harsh, grating rasp, like fingernails scraping across a blackboard.

“You don’t understand,” he said, his voice slipping into a near-whisper. “You’ll never understand. You don’t know how it feels. How good it feels to break someone down to nothing. To make them beg. To make them need you.”

I flinched as his hand tightened further on my shoulder, his fingers digging deep into my skin.

“Soon, you’ll get it. And when you do... you’ll be just like her. You’ll be begging me to help you. Begging me to make you better. Oh, what a beautiful day that will be.”

He turned to the woman then, as though I were nothing more than a shadow in the room.

“Take her to meet Lilith,” he said coldly. “It’s time for her next lesson.”

The woman didn’t move at first. She just stared at the floor, hollow-eyed and empty, as if she were already somewhere far away, lost within herself. Then, slowly, she rose, unsteadily climbing to her feet, her body swaying from fatigue and stress. Her eyes remained fixed ahead, rigid and vacant, desperately avoiding my gaze.

In that moment, I was torn between two things that scared me senseless. The first was her. She had been changed completely, which frightened me almost as much as he did. She wasn’t just broken. She had been altered. I didn’t even recognize her anymore.

The second thing was what hit me the hardest, sinking deep into my consciousness like a needle. I could feel the unease growing as a strange, knowing certainty washed over me, telling me that whatever was coming next would not be as pleasant as the torment I’d already endured. This felt different. He’d had enough of trying to break me down. He was preparing me for something darker, something worse that I didn’t understand yet, but could already feel reaching out for me.

He reached down for my right hand, yanking it toward him until the chain rattled tight. He reached into his pocket, pulling out a small, silver key, and unlocked the shackle. My heart fluttered as it clattered to the floor. This was what I’d been waiting for. I knew this was my chance to get out of this place.

The instant my wrist came free, I jerked my hand back and lunged at him, frantically swinging for anything I could hit, hoping it would hurt him enough for me to escape. He snapped backward and away from my fist before quickly raising his hand and bringing it crashing down across my face, snapping my head back against the wall. My body fell limp, and my vision briefly faded as the world spun around me. Through the haze, I rolled my head back around, catching his gaze by mistake.

“See?” He said calmly through gritted teeth, “This is why you need another lesson. You’re just not ready yet.”

I barely felt him release the shackle on my other wrist before a sharp, mechanical sound clicked in my ear. I felt a cold sting close around my wrists as he fastened handcuffs in place of the shackles.

Once he finished tightening the cuffs, he grabbed my chin and jerked my head upward, forcing me to look at him. He stared deep into my eyes, giving me one last, chilling smile before saying:

“Enjoy your lesson, Emily.”

He stood up and walked out of the room without saying another word, the door clicking shut behind him.

For a few seconds, I just sat there, dizzy and disoriented, scrambling to make sense of what was going on. I didn’t know what was happening, but I knew I was running out of time.

I heard the woman move, slowly shuffling toward me. Her hands trembled as she reached for me, but her grip was surprisingly strong. She didn’t speak or even look me in the eyes as she stood me upright. My legs wobbled beneath me. I was dazed, weak, and broken, barely able to even stand on my own without her assistance. She steadied me in place and, without hesitation, gently pushed me forward. She held one hand against the small of my back and the other one clutching the chain on my handcuffs. She’d take a step and then pull me along behind her like a dog on a leash, each movement stiff and mechanical, as if she weren’t even aware of what she was doing. I staggered along behind her, my body paralyzed with fear.

We stepped into the hallway outside the room, and she led me toward a narrow door at the far end. When she opened it, a rush of cold air spilled out, carrying the scent of sweat and long-forgotten torment. Beyond the doorway lay a sub-basement that descended into what felt like some alien underworld.

The stairs leading down were steep and uneven, each step groaning under our combined weight. The deeper we descended, the worse everything felt. The corridor stretched into darkness, long and quiet, like a predator closing in.

Finally, we reached the bottom, where another door stood. Before I could even examine it, the woman reached out and turned the handle. The door to the room opened with a loud groan, twisting my stomach into knots. As I was guided across the threshold, I scanned the space thoroughly, the truth hitting me almost immediately. This wasn’t a room at all. It was a cage.

The floor was made of slick, uneven concrete stained with remnants of something I couldn’t identify. Chains and hooks jutted from the walls at odd angles, shadows pooling beneath them. A single dim light flickered overhead, casting the room in a sickening orange glow that barely reached the walls. Cold, blackened metal bars stretched from floor to ceiling, enclosing a space barely large enough for a single person.

Inside the bars lay another woman, bloodied, bruised, naked, and curled up in a ball. She didn’t move when we entered, but her eyes were wide open, staring into the blackness. They were empty, as if she had been stripped of her own soul. I could feel her despair radiating from her.

“Go ahead,” the woman said to me, her voice distant. “He says you have to meet her... and then, you’ll be ready.”

“Meet her?” I whispered, hoping the woman behind the bars couldn’t hear me.

I took a step back, but the woman behind me grabbed the chain on the cuffs and forced me forward.

“He says you have to know... You have to know what happens when you don’t learn quickly enough. He just wants you to obey.” The woman’s voice trembled.

I could feel her hands shaking through the metal of the handcuffs.

“Please... don’t make the same mistake I did.”

The cage creaked as the woman inside it shifted. She looked up at me with blank eyes, her expression unreadable, like a shell of a person who’d once been.

“Please,” I whispered, choking on the words. “Please don’t put me in there.”

She didn’t answer. She just kept pulling me toward the cage, following her orders. That’s when it all hit me. I finally accepted the truth that I had tried so hard to deny.

She was never going to help me.

She was just another victim. Another piece of his twisted puzzle. And I was just one more name on the list of broken people who would learn the hard way.
