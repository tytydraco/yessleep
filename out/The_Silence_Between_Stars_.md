Jake sat at his desk, his fingers idly hovering over his keyboard. The screen glowed dimly before him, but the words didn’t come. They hadn’t for years. His thoughts moved like shadows in the back of his mind, swirling and indistinct. Yet underneath it all, there was something sharper—a constant hum of discontent, like a quiet, pulsing static that never ceased. Something was missing, and that emptiness had only grown larger with time.

Thirty-six years old and already hollow. His youth, spent in the grasp of strict religious doctrines, had left him sheltered, a life lived without indulgence. The wildness of youth had passed him by, and in its place was something far darker—deeper than regret, more monstrous than guilt. Every missed opportunity gnawed at him now, not with the sharp teeth of momentary loss, but with the slow, grinding erosion of time.

Sex. Parties. Freedom. These things had been dangled before him, forbidden fruit he had been taught to reject. The church had told him they were sinful, dangerous, to be saved for marriage. But now, the marriage he had waited so long for felt like a different kind of prison. Even his body, aching with unfulfilled desires, seemed to rebel against him—tight, needy, always unsatisfied.

The cosmic irony of it all was not lost on Jake.

He met Sarah late, well after his friends had moved on to wilder, freer lives. She was exactly what he had been taught to want: virtuous, modest, devout. The woman who would complete him in the way he had been promised. They married quickly, and for the first few months, there was a kind of heat between them—awkward, fumbling, but new. There was hope. He thought this was what he had waited for, this is what his restraint had been for.

But like everything in his life, that too faded. The fire that had once been there flickered and died before he had even learned how to stoke it. Sarah, it seemed, had little interest in sex. She rarely initiated and withdrew more often than not. When they did come together, it was mechanical, distant, cold. She performed the act out of some obligation—never out of want, never with passion. Over time, she had become more like a shadow in his life, her touch distant and her gaze vacant.

Jake tried to fill the void with work, with hobbies, with prayers that had grown bitter and silent in his mouth. But the absence of physical touch gnawed at him in ways that words failed to describe. The absence of release, of passion, of the simple human need to be desired, festered in him. He would lie next to Sarah at night, feeling the cold space between them widen, as though something vast and invisible had crept into their bed. He could feel its weight, its breath on the back of his neck, but when he turned to her, Sarah’s eyes were closed, her body turned away, lost in a world that was no longer his.

There were times when he could barely sleep, his mind haunted by images of what could have been. Women at the bars he’d never gone to. Friends who had vanished into wild nights he had never joined. Lovers he had never met. Instead, he had waited. And what had that waiting brought him?

The nights stretched on, long and endless, as if they existed outside time. And in that dark, sleepless quiet, he felt something else stir within him—something ancient, primal, and full of malice.

The first time Jake saw the stars move, he thought he was imagining it. He had woken in the dead of night, his body tight with the familiar ache of frustration, the desire he could never seem to quell. The room was too still, too silent, and as he looked out the window, something caught his eye—something that didn’t belong. The stars, usually distant and cold, seemed to shift, almost imperceptibly, but enough that it filled his stomach with a slow, creeping dread. They swirled in patterns that defied nature, as though the fabric of the universe itself was folding in on itself, rearranging into symbols too vast for the human mind to comprehend.

He blinked, rubbed his eyes, but the movement remained, steady and terrifying. The longer he stared, the more he felt an alien presence behind those stars, watching, waiting, its gaze fixed on him. The oppressive weight of unseen eyes bore down on him, filling him with a sense of smallness, of insignificance, as if he were a mere speck in a universe that had no care for his desires, no concern for his suffering.

He looked to Sarah, her form barely visible in the darkness, her breath slow and steady. She was asleep, unmoved by the horror unfolding in the heavens above them. She hadn’t touched him in weeks, hadn’t kissed him in longer. And yet, she slept soundly, unaware or uncaring of the deep, festering wound that was their marriage.

The next few days were worse. Jake began to notice the stars moving more frequently, as though they were alive, shifting through dimensions he couldn’t perceive. The strange symbols they formed began to haunt his waking thoughts, creeping into the edges of his mind like dark tendrils of madness. The universe was not indifferent. It was watching. And it was hungry.

Jake found himself waking more often in the night, plagued by nightmares of a vast, tentacled being that swam through the cosmos, its limbs unfurling like serpents in the darkness. The creature was made of shadow and stars, its form ever-shifting, impossible to look at directly. And it saw him—it saw the emptiness inside him, the frustration, the lust that had never been fulfilled. It fed on it.

In those dreams, he would reach for Sarah, but she was already gone, dissolved into the blackness that oozed from the creature’s form. Her face, her body, her warmth—all gone, replaced by the cold, cosmic vastness that now filled his every waking moment.

One night, he could bear it no longer. He awoke again to the sight of the stars shifting, rearranging into a pattern so intricate, so wrong, that it made his skin crawl. His heart pounded in his chest, and his body, still aching for a touch that would never come, trembled with a mixture of fear and frustration. He rolled over and reached for Sarah, desperate for some connection, some escape from the horror unfolding in the sky above.

But when he touched her, her skin was cold—too cold. He recoiled, and as she turned toward him, her eyes opened. They were empty. Dark voids where pupils should have been, blacker than the night sky, swirling with the same impossible patterns he had seen in the stars. She smiled—a twisted, alien smile that sent a jolt of terror through his body.

“I told you,” she whispered, her voice not her own, but something deeper, more ancient. “There is no escape from what you denied yourself.”

Jake stumbled out of bed, his legs shaking. The world around him seemed to warp, the walls bending inward, the floor shifting beneath his feet. He ran to the window and looked out, only to see the stars spinning wildly, the constellations writhing like serpents in the sky. And in the center of it all, the creature from his nightmares emerged—its vast, writhing form blotting out the heavens, its tentacles reaching down toward him, toward the house, toward the life he had wasted.

His breath came in shallow gasps as he realized, with horrifying clarity, that the thing had always been there, waiting. It had watched him since his youth, feeding on his unfulfilled desires, growing stronger with each passing year of restraint, of denial. The cosmic joke was that in waiting, in abstaining, he had starved himself of life and love—and the universe had starved with him.

Now, it wanted to consume him whole.

As the darkness crept into the room, Jake fell to his knees, staring up at the swirling void where the stars had been. He could feel it now—feel the thing pressing against the fragile veil of reality, its vast, uncaring mind brushing against his own. It was endless. It was eternal. And it was hungry.

The stars whispered to him, their voices cold and distant.

This is what you were promised. This is what you waited for.

And with that final thought, the universe swallowed him.
