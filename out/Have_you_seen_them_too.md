“I remember the first time I saw one of them”
he said, his far off gaze told me that this new patient was lost deep in his own thoughts.
“I could tell something was off, because, even though his head didn't move, his eyes followed me wherever I went”.
“Followed you how?”
I inquired. 
“Well, not really, like he wasn't actually looking at me, but”
the man trailed off for a moment as if he was trying to put his thoughts into words
“I knew he was, you know?”.
I did know, this was text book paranoia as far as I was concerned.

“It's important that you learn to separate delusion from reality, John”.
I said.
“I, I know, but, this time it just... it felt so real, other times it’s felt like a dream, but it just, it felt so real.”
Said John, his shoulders slumped and gaze turned downward.
“That was only the beginning though, wasn't it John”
“Yeah, it, it got so much worse, I felt like everyone was looking at me all the time, even when no one was around”
I scribbled something on my notepad.
“So you felt like you were being watched?”. “All the time” John replied.
“Well, that is typical of someone with your condition. Has the Clozapine done you any good?”
“Not really”
“There is an experimental treatment from Switzerland that I think might just do the trick for you”.
I stood up to get my prescription pad to write out the new prescription for my patient. John looked over to where I had left my note pad.

Name: John [redacted]

Diagnosis: paranoid personality

Institutionalize: not recommended

Notes: ideal subject

“Right”
I said as I sat back in my chair.
“One tablet twice daily, breakfast and dinner.”
With that, I stood up, and strode purposefully towards the door.

The following week, as I entered the room in which the now disheveled John [redacted] sat, I could tell something had definitely happened.
“I killed one of them” The ragged man stated, as though it was merely idle chit chat.
“I beg your pardon, you what?” I said, still standing in front of my chair.
“I killed one, it's ok, their not human, not like you and I” John said. “They look like us, and they want us to think they are like us, but I've seen what they do when they think no one is watching”.
As the silence began to drag on between us John spoke up again “I found out what they really are”.
“And what is that?” I asked, now very aware that that John was sat in the perfect position to block me from getting to the door.
“Robots, doctor, they have been replaced. The one I killed looked like my neighbor, but he was just a robot, all full of wires and... and machine parts.”
“John, I need you to realize that this isn't real, people aren't being replaced by machines”.
“That's what my neighbor said, but I didn't care, he wasn't really my neighbor, just one of those... things, so I had to take him apart, he is still hanging from a hook in my barn”.

I noticed for the first time the brown stains around the cuffs of John’s sleeves and spattered across his shirt.
“I took all the pieces out, it was a bit messy, but I was right, he was made of metal, I could smell it.”
“John, I think we should wrap up our visit here, ok?”.
I wanted nothing more than to run to a neighboring office, lock the door and call the police, but I knew that John was faster and stronger than me. I would have to be very careful not to alert John as to my intentions. For now, I would have to settle for keeping my eyes fixed on the burly, blood covered farmer.
“Why are you staring at me?” John asked. I didn't have a good answer that wouldn't worsen the situation, so I merely stammered “I’m not staring, just... focused on our conversation”.
“You're looking at me like my neighbor did”.
John slowly got to his feet and began to take careful, measured steps towards me. That was the breaking point,

I had backed up to the large window at the back of my office. I threw myself with all my might at the window, which shattered sending shards of glass flying out into the garden at the back of the ward. I got to my feet and began running, behind me I could hear the large mans feet pounding against the ground, getting closer and closer. I got to the street, John close on my heels. As I got to the other side of the street narrowly avoiding a car, I heard a loud thud, and then a moment later, a second quieter thud. I turned around to see John lying unconscious and bleeding on the road. I ran to the pay phone at the corner of the street and called for an ambulance.

I didn't leave my house for a few days after that. I began taking medication that came highly recommended by my wards benefactors.
When I finally did go out, I couldnt help but notice that everyone was staring at me. I tried to ignore them, but no matter where I went, they always watched me.
I struggled to return to normal after my last meeting with John, and eventually, I did make a return to some semblance of normal.
All that went out the window when I heard the mechanical hum of my assistant walking by. I tried to reason that it must have been something else making the sound, but as time went on, more and more of the people I talked to seemed a little less human and a little more machine.

I could see them everywhere I went, I  could see them when I looked at the faces of my friends and the passers by on the street. They had all been replaced.
None of them where human anymore.

Have you seen them too?
