I’m writing this because I’m scared. No, I’m terrified. I’m sitting here in my car, cold, breath trembling. I’ve been in this same spot since last night. I don’t know what to do, but I hope this finds you and you find me, before they do.

Let me start by prefacing this with a little bit of background. I want y’all to know that we’re not crazy. We’re young, a little wild, but not crazy. My name is George and I have a twin sister named Gina. Gina is dating my bestfriend since high school, Preston. Obviously, I’ve known my sister my whole life and we met Preston at 14. We’re 24 now. We have a close bond, so close that we all live together. Preston and Gina are both data engineers and I’m a private chef. We live pretty normal lives. However, we do occasionally love a little thrill seeking; rock climbing, bungee jumping, skating in empty pools on private property, exploring and tagging abandoned buildings —- you know, things like that. It’s a relief from having to be professional all of time. I won’t lie though, I’m starting to regret ever having enjoyed those things.

But, that’s enough background. I ought to make this quick. Here’s what’s been happening. A month ago, things were normal. It was like any other day. Preston and Gina woke up early and ate breakfast at the kitchen table. The smell of eggs, bacon, and maple filled the house. It drew me to the kitchen like the sounds of a siren draws a sailor to his demise. I should’ve stayed upstairs, but I mosied on down there. I could hear them laughing softly at whatever TikTok video my sister was showing Preston. “Good morning brother.”, Gina’s voice echoed as I bent the corner. “Morning y’all”, my voice cracking as I forced a sound from my parched lips. “Food’s in the microwave bro.” Preston, responding to the sound of my stomach growling. Everything was normal. Everything was as it should be.

“So, are you taking the job George?” I looked at my sister as she peered at me from over the top of her coffee mug.

“Yeah, I think so. I mean, I told them yes.”

“I think it’s a good idea.” Preston added. I was offered a job in New York the week before. A private chef experience for a couple bougie millionaires. I’d never been to New York, but I’ve always wanted to go. The job was three weeks long, or so it should’ve been. It was some kind of rich person’s retreat, dressed up as “fiscal planning”.

(Gina) “Well, before you go. Let’s all do something together. When do you leave again?”

I should’ve said no.

“If I go, Monday.”

(Preston) “That’s two days from now? Damn, I didn’t realize it was that soon. We -“

(Gina) “We should go tag that abandoned warehouse we saw the other day!!!!”

“Abandoned warehouse? Where?”

(Preston) “Yeah, a few blocks over.”

“No, there’s not. I mean I think I would’ve noticed an abandoned warehouse that close to home.”

(Gina) “I mean, we just moved here a month ago and we never really explored the area. Feasible that you would’ve missed it.”

(Preston) “Plus, it’s pretty tucked away. It’s like off a side street, almost cul de sac style. We only saw it because Gina here made a wrong turn yesterday.”

(Gina) “Whatever, so you down or what bro?”

“Yeah, whatever sure. Let’s go tomorrow so I can use Sunday to pack.”

I should’ve said no.

My sister let out an excited squeal.

The next day it was business as usual. Everything was normal. Everything was the way it should be. Me, Gina, and Preston pilled into my Toyata 4Runner. The air was familiar, a smell I had grown accustomed to from book bags filled to the brim with spray paint mixed with smell of the twine that built the rope we used for climbing. I couldn’t tell where one smell began and the other ended. There was an excited energy in the car as Gina pointed out the directions. Left, left, right at the light, left on the side street, right down a street that looked more like an alley, drive to the end of the field.

Preston was right. This was a cul de sac, with a huge empty warehouse at the end. Decrepit. Over-grown. The trees draped over the building like bags on the eyes of a man who’s lived way past his prime. Graffiti lined the building, reminding me of the faded tattoos on my skin. I know this may not make any sense, but the building —- the building almost seemed alive. Sad. Forgotten.

I parked. We got out the car, book bags, smiles on Preston and Gina.

“Y’all sure about this?”

(Preston) “Never known you to be scared bro.”

“I’m not”….

I was lying. I didn’t know why, but I didn’t want to go in. Maybe it was intuition. Maybe I watched too many scary movies. I don’t know, but I must’ve zone out. I found myself standing there alone. Preston and Gina, already in the building, beckoning me forward.

Each step was heavy, boulders tied to my feet. I took a deep breath and thought to myself. “Man up, you’ve walked into a hundred abandoned buildings. This one’s no different. This isn’t a movie, it’s real life.”

Words I regret now.

I walked in. The air outside was cold, but the air in here was warm, hot even. I could feel the house breathing, the warm air moved at a cadence, in and out, in and out, in and out. Before I knew it my breath matched it.

Hold on y’all, I think I need to move my car. I see people in the field. I’ll be back to finish in a moment, but I’ll post this for now. Just in case.

————————————————————————-

It was them. My bestfriend and my sister, walking across that field, towards me, expressions empty. I think I pressed the pedal through the floor as I drove out of there. In the rear view mirror, I saw them turn around and stare at my fleeing car. No smile, no frown, just a blank stare, standing there, watching from where it used to be.

I know I said, I’d be back in a moment and it’s been hours. But bear with me, I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t get the image of their faces out of my head. I drove to escape my mind. It’s playing tricks on me. I needed time to collect my thoughts.

Anyways, I’ll start back from where I was. I promise it will all make sense at the end.

When I walked in that building, it felt like I walked into the mouth of a beast. It was hot, humid, alive. The normal sounds of an abandoned building escaped whatever place this was; no birds, no rats scruffling across the floor, no creaks as we walked through. Complete silence.

(Gina) “Let’s go up there.” She pointed to an empty spot on the wall that had a staircase leading up to it or what was left of one.

“Sure.” I think my voice cracked a little.

(Preston) “You head up first since the ropes are in your bag, you can tie one up and toss it down for us.”

I should’ve turned around.

I crept up the stairs, still not a sound. It didn’t creak under the pressure of my steps. I couldn’t even hear the tap of my foot as I climbed up. Utter silence.

(Gina) “Hurry up George, you’re moving like a grandpa.”

“Shut up Gina.”, but she was right. Everything in my body was telling me to stop. Walk back down. Go home. Instead, I tied the rope around a rail that was bolted to the wall and flung it down.

“Here, but I don’t think you’ll need it. The steps didn’t give at all when I was coming up.”

(Preston) “You’re right. Easy work.”

(Gina) “Well keep going. I want to tag that spot.”

(Preston) “Yeah, we’re going Gina relax.”

We had to walk across a tattered floor, missing half its boards to get there but we did. Preston and Gina dropped their books bags and started unpacking the cans.

(Preston) “Look alive George” He threw a couple of cans my way and I tripped over a board in attempt the catch them. Fell flat on my face. I could hear the sounds of my sister’s obnoxious laugh and Preston walked over to help me.

(Preston) “Damn, you good man?”

“Yeah, I just lost my balance for a moment. Shit, it’s a lot going on with this floor.”

(Preston) “Yeah, let’s get this over with”

Preston walked back to his spot on the wall. I took a deep breath, shook my can, and sprayed away. In that moment, every worry drifted. As I crossed my lines and made my imagination come to life, I lost track of time. I forgot where we were and the fear that enveloped me as I walked through this building. I walked through what used to be a door way, continued to tag. I was in another world….. until I wasn’t.

Crash

My heart dropped as I heard the sounds of boards breaking, my sister screaming. I ran back out from around the door way, Preston had fell through the floor.

(Preston) “Fuck! Help me out of here. I can’t see shit down here.” For some reason, I was froze. My feet wouldn’t budge no matter how hard I tried.

(Gina) “George, what the fuck!” Gina ran over and yanked the other rope out of my book bag and tossed it in. I followed her, wrapped my arms around her body, grabbing the rope to pull it back.

(Gina) “Preston! Preston!”

No answer.

(Gina) “Preston grab the FUCKING rope”

It was a second, a second too long before we felt a tug on the rope.

I should’ve known then, we should’ve never came here.

I walked backwards, my sister following my steps, lifting Preston out of the hole. He fell over to the side, covered in filth, clearly annoyed.

“Preston, how you feel man?”

(Preston) “I’m fine, let’s just get the fuck out of here.”

(Gina) “Yeah, let’s go”

We packed the supplies, untied the rope on the stairs and headed out the building. I didn’t say anything, but I was relieved. It was dark now, and I just wanted to get home.

The car ride was —- dead. Preston nor Gina said a word. As soon as we walked in Preston went upstairs and Gina didn’t hesitate when he was out of sight.

(Gina) “What the fuck was that earlier George?”

“What are you talking about?”

(Gina) “Why did it take you so long to help?”

“I don’t know”

(Gina) “I don’t know? You answer is I don’t fucking know?! Unbelievable.”

She scoffed and left me standing there. I don’t know why, but in that moment, part of me wanted to leave him. Leave him in that hole. Leave him where he was at.

We didn’t see each other for the rest of that night and we barely spoke until I left. Just a few “what’s up”’s in passing. I figured Gina told Preston that I froze and he was pissed at me.  When Monday came, I slipped out the house early and sent them a text. “Just left. See y’all in a few weeks”

Honestly. A week and a half had passed since the incident and I hadn’t spoke to Preston or my sister. Being a private chef for the rich was exhausting work. I barely had time to talk or text and when I had free time, I slept. But one day, my sister called me.

(Gina) “George.”, her voice broke a little as she said my name

“Wassup.”

(Gina) “Preston has been acting weird lately.”

“What do you mean?”

(Gina) “3 days ago. I came down stairs and he was just watching static on the tv. I called his name a couple times. He didn’t even budge. It freaked me out a bit so I went upstairs. I figured I’d ask him when he came up for bed but he never did.”

“Well, did you talk to him about it?”

(Gina) “I tried, but he blew me off. He said he woke up on the couch after falling asleep watching tv and maybe it had just went out or something.”

“Maybe it did.”

(Gina) “No, he was sitting up right. He wasn’t sleep, he was staring at the screen. Silent.”

“I don’t know what you want me to say Gina. Maybe he was just screwing with you.”

(Gina) “He’s been doing it for 3 days straight!”

“Maybe he’s committed to the bit”

(Gina) she was clearly annoyed, “Whatever George, can you just talk to him?”

“Yeah, I’ll talk to him. But I’m sure you’re overreacting.”

She was not overreacting. I know that now.

I called Preston that day and he didn’t answer. I shot him a text asking if he was okay. He said everything was fine and I left it there. I told myself, I’d call him later but as I said, the job was exhausting. It slipped my mind completely. I never reached back out.

3 days passed.

My sister called me again. Sobbing.

(Gina) “George, please come home. Something is wrong with him.”

“What Gina, what are you talking about?”

(Gina) “Something is wrong with Preston. Please, come home. I’m scared.”

“I can’t just leave because you and Preston are in a fight.”

(Gina) “We’re not in a fight. He - He’s different. Every night. Him and that damn tv. It’s every single night. I find him staring at me constantly. This morning when I woke he was just standing over our bed. He was staring at me, no expression at all. Just staring. I don’t feel safe.”

“Then just got to mom and dad’s for a while. I can’t come back.” She wasn’t listening.

(Gina) “George. There’s something wrong. When I look into his eyes, I don’t. George, he keeps going ba——”

I was being called by my party as she was talking.

“Gina, I have to go. My clients are calling.”

I hung up abruptly and finished my day out. By the time I woke up, my sister had called me 42 times. Up until then, I thought she was just being dramatic but as I scrolled through my missed calls —- my heart sank more and more. I mean I was sure it was nothing, but I felt obligated to at least check it out. That was my sister after all and something, even if it was nothing, had her frightened. Against my will, I cut my job short and brought the next ticket back to Minnesota. I called my sister from the airport.

“Gina.”

(Gina) “Are you coming home?”

“Yeah. My flight lands in 2.5 hours. ”

(Gina) “I’ll meet you there.”

I pondered about my sister’s calls the whole flight home. I mean, Preston’s behavior was strange but he wasn’t causing any harm. Maybe I just didn’t understand because I wasn’t witnessing it. I kept trying to remember what she was saying when I hung up. He keeps going where?

My flight landed and my sister quickly found me. She was waiting at the baggage claim.

“You were just waiting here?”

(Gina) “I told you, I’d meet you here.”

“Where’s your car?”

(Gina) “I ubered here. You parked here right?”

“Yeah.”

We walked to my car. Silence filled the atmosphere so thick you could cut it. She didn’t say another word until we got back into the car.

(Gina) “He’s been going back there every night.”

“Going where?”

(Gina) “That warehouse.”

“Why?”

(Gina) “I don’t know.”

“Where’s he now?”

(Gina) “I don’t know. I went to mom and dad’s last night and I hadn’t been back. I wasn’t going back until you came home.”

“Okay.”

I didn’t have to tell my sister where I was going. She knew. We pulled up in the driveway and I felt a lump form in my throat. I walked in and Preston was standing in the kitchen. He didn’t even look up when we came in. He just stood there, staring at the counter until his gaze slowly moved up to meet mine. I felt violated, like he could see through me. Fully clothed but I felt naked in front of him. His eyes. His eyes were lifeless. He seemed a man with no soul, eyes sunken, hair disheveled. It felt like forever passed without him saying a word.

“Preston. You look like shit.”

He didn’t respond, not even a grunt.

He stepped from around the kitchen corner and every bone in my body shook as he walked past me. He didn’t acknowledge us. He just walked out the front door, got in his car, and drove off.

For the love of God, I don’t know why I went after  him. We should’ve just let him leave. But I saw the tears in my sister’s eyes. She pleaded with me without ever moving her lips.

“Come on. We’ll follow him.”

(Gina) “We don’t have to. He’s going to that warehouse.”

The sounds of that place made my heart skip a beat. I immediately recalled our conversation last night and knew that’s what she was trying to tell me. This isn’t how I planned to spend my first day back, chasing a guy who clearly doesn’t want to be caught.

I should’ve told her to just let it go, but instead I sighed, turned around, walked out the door. I could hear her foot steps behind me.

Another silent car ride, but my thoughts screamed at me. “Turn around. Do not go back to the warehouse. Do not step foot back in the building.” With every caution my brain threw at me, I threw a reason back, “That’s my bestfriend. My sister loves him. It’s just a warehouse.” But all that reason left as I pulled back up to that place, as I walked up to the front door, my sister clinging to my back. Her breath was shaky, I could tell she was scared.

We shouldn’t have went in there. We shouldn’t have went after him.

It was different this time when we entered. The silence this place once offered has dissipated. I heard steps coming from upstairs. The air moving through the building gave off a soft groan, the type you hear from an animal that hadn’t fed in days but just laid eyes on its next meal.

(Gina) “Is that a rope?” She pointed towards the spot we tagged when we first came here. She was right, there was a rope leading directly into the hole Preston fell in before.

We should’ve turned around there.

I walked forward without ever responding; up the same stairs from before but this time they creaked, over the same broken floor boards that squealed with each step now. Careful, as I knew my sister was following me. I stopped once we reached the hole.

I don’t know why, but I whispered “Preston. Yo Preston, you down there.”

A chill went up my spine as I heard his voice, familiar but not quite right.

(Preston) “Down here.” I saw a slight tug on the rope.

I shouldn’t have went down there.

“Stay here and turn the flash light on your phone on”

(Gina) “You’re going down there?”

“Looks like I have to.”

I’m almost certain you could see my heart pounding out of my chest. What was I even thinking? I grabbed the rope and lowered myself down. My sister held the flash light over my head but it did nothing to pierce the dark abyss I was entering. It felt like forever as I climbed my way down the rope, each drop down my grip loosening up, palms sweating, heart racing.

Thud

My feet hit the ground. It was pitch black. I fumbled around in my pocket for my phone. I didn’t want to turn my flash light on, but I couldn’t see a thing.

I should’ve climbed back out. Matter of fact, I should’ve never came down here.

Before I could get my phone out of my pocket.

Thud

I stifled my scream but jumped, fell straight on my ass.

(Gina) “It’s me”

“I told you to stay up there. Why did you come down here?! I thought you were holding the light.” I yelled at her softly.

(Gina) “I couldn’t let you come alone and I put the phone in my mouth while I climbed down.”

The light, I had never turned my flash light on.

My sister had her flash pointed at me as I finally got the phone out my pocket and hit the flash light switch.

I should’ve left it off. Nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see.

I saw him. I saw Preston, except, this wasn’t Preston at all. He stood there, staring at us. He said nothing. He just tilted his head and for a split second he smirked before he took one step forward and his eyes flashed a pitch black before turning back to normal.

Gina screamed, Preston or whatever that was ran. I scurried backward until I ran into something. My back hit only what I could describe as a pod. It was huge, round, and filled with something akin to amniotic fluid. I whipped my head around, flash light following.

I couldn’t wrap my mind around what I saw. It was Preston, inside of this thing. I couldn’t hold in my holler as I ran back to my sister. She was on the floor, sobbing.

“Get up. I found Preston.”

(Gina) shaking her head. “That wasn’t Preston. That thing wasn’t Preston.”

“No, the real -“ I didn’t finish my sentence, I just dragged her over to the wall and flashed my light. I didn’t know her eyes could get that wide. She immediately began clawing at whatever it was, trying to break him free.

(Gina) “Preston. Preston. Preston.”

“Gina, He gon—-“ . I ate my words before I could even finish them, he started to move as she started to break the sack. I couldn’t believe it. How was that even possible? Before I knew it, I was clawing at it too. The slime running down my hand and arms. My clothes covered in goo.

(Preston) “huhhhhh” Preston dropped out, coughing relentlessly, hands and knees on the floor. Before I could even say anything to him, I heard my sister scream again.

“GINA!” Was all I could get out before I hit the floor, my phone knocked out of my hand. My side was pierced, something was stabbing me and somebody or something was on top of me.

(Preston) “Fuck!” Another thud, whatever was on top of me was gone and I could see a light running towards it. Preston was fighting Preston.

(Preston) “Help George!”

Preston yelled at me, the familiar voice of my friend and I felt around for anything. Anything at all. In the dark, I picked up a piece of wood that broke off the floor boards from above. I grabbed it, grabbed my side, stood up.

“Hold him.” I said as I charged forward. The only thing guiding me is the shaky light from my sister’s phone. I plunged it right into it, the other Preston, before I fell. Preston took over, I could hear the sounds of flesh ripping a part, until the comfort of silence filled the air. It stopped moving, I could only assume it was dead. Before long, I felt Preston’s arms wrap around me and he dragged me, directing Gina to the rope.

Wait. How did he know this place so well? How did he regain strength so quickly? None of this makes any sense, but in that moment I was grateful for all the things I didn’t understand.

I didn’t dare to think it. Although, deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.

(Preston) “Grab the rope George”

I did as he told, every surge of adrenaline running through my body as blood poured out of my side. I could see my sister’s flash shuffling up the rope. Pain surged as Preston tied the rope around our bodies, he gripped me with his legs, and climbed up —- Gina, at the top, pulling us both up. I had never seen her with that much strength before.

We made it out that hole but before we left I looked down and saw the flash of my phone still shining upward. In the faint glow, I saw them. More pods. More bodies. Eyes fixated as Preston lifted me over his back, carrying me away.

“Guys”. I passed out before I could tell them what I saw.

I woke up in the hospital with stitches, Preston and Gina by my bedside.

“What happened?”

(Preston) “You got stabbed with a wooden plank. You lost a lot of blood.”

“No. I know that. What the fuck happened to you down there?”

(Preston) “I don’t know, but I saw everything it did. I have every memory of its time as me.”

I knew Preston well. He was lying.

“What was that thing?”

(Preston) “I don’t know.”

Something in his voice seemed off. It was steady, even paced, as if he rehearsed his words. I brushed it off but he seemed, too calm after witnessing —— no living through what he just lived through. I would’ve pressed this issue, but…. I just wanted to forget the whole nightmare.

I shouldn’t have went back home after that. Went to stay with my parents. I didn’t though.

Two weeks have passed since I was released from the hospital. I swear y’all, things were back to normal. We had decided that we weren’t going to mention that place again or speak about what happened. We were never going to go back to that building. We promised each other we were going to move on with our lives. Everything was normal. Everything was the way it should be.

Until it wasn’t. Yesterday, I went down stairs to get a glass of water in the middle of the night. I saw Preston and Gina were up, watching static on the tv. I felt my throat close as I grabbed my keys and walked out the front door. I didn’t even bother getting dressed or putting on real shoes. I drove straight to that building. Left, left, right at the light, left on the side street, right down a street that looked more like an alley, drive to the end of the field. My mind was in a frenzy…. Who or what have I been living with? So many more questions I dared not to ask myself.

I stayed there all night. That’s where I began to write this story, moving only when I saw them coming from across the field earlier. Whoever I saw though, that wasn’t Preston or Gina. The eyes, the eyes were black. If I can be truthful with you all, I don’t know which is worse. The fact that I had been living with them, business as usual for weeks. Or the fact that I don’t know where my bestfriend or my sister are because when I went back last night, the building was gone. It was just an empty field. I think it was the combination of both that prompted me to write about this. Somebody else had to know what’s happened to me. My lack of understanding had me driving for hours. And for some odd reason, after it all, I came back home. A sailor returning to his boat. I’ve been here for hours now, trying to find the words to finish this story. Wrapping my mind around what’s happened, what’s happening. I can’t make sense of it. I don’t think I even want to know anymore. I haven’t moved from my room, but I heard them come inside a while ago.

I don’t think I’m scared anymore. I’ve accepted my fate or maybe I’m just too tired to fight it. Either way…..

Everything felt normal, except, it’s wasn’t. Things were different, but ever so slightly. It’s night time and….

Downstairs I smell eggs, bacon, and maple. The smell is drawing me to the kitchen, the siren’s call to my sailor. I don’t want to, but I feel the need to go downstairs. I can hear them laughing.
