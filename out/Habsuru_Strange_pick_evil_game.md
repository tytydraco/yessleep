First of all, english is not my first language and i am already nervous of sharing this history... And you'll see why. I used to be the most skeptical person ever since childhood, literally a child prodigy who was a little bit smarter than many in my age group so tooth fairy, santa claus and things like that never meant a thing to me. Maybe because in my country we don't have this assiduity with these beliefs so it didn't make any difference... I've always liked online games, from weirder or indie sites. Kind of embarrassing to admit since im now 20 and started this alternative practice trying to find 'online sex games' in my early teens, gross ik.

But last week something really weird happened. REALLY. At some point, i was unsure if i should talk about it since i dont have any proof or like? How to go to police, tell friends, tell anybody without looking crazy? But my cousin always like to watch those minecraft videos with story telling at background, that's when i finally found reddit and subbed the first sharing horror experiences.

I found a new site. At first had something normal, like a doll dress up with really low budget such as dolldivine or rinmarugames, only an name in red "Habsuru" and only one game showing up and playable. The design it wasnt spooky, i swear, it was just a normal page with grey and red.

I didnt saw a name for the game, so i tought, should be Habsuru and a really short description i couldnt remember that well, but it was like 'save an life, you can play only once' and some warning about how the game dont work anytime. The game started, empty black screen, and one box for saying ur name. Ok, dont think im a coward even if im am, but only staring at it makes me nervous asf. I start, letter by letter, my user.

Vallerysm.

"Welcome Vallerysm" it said, and two options popped out. Red, bloody red, but no words. I was going to shut the game, exit the website, but i couldnt. Like, something on it was making me uncomfortable as hell but also curious. I dont have to tell which one hit harder. I refresh the page, hoping it was some bug since its an indie game.

Again, black empty screen. But now still having "Welcome Vallerysm", and options.

"Girl" or "Boy", and i thought right away we're talking about making my player or avatar. I picked girl, since i was tried to make my avatar look like me, such a fucking error. A silhoutte of a girl, only on black, appeard at screen. I stand there, trying to look at the shadow and get her someting, see something. Maybe its the game or an blocked character. She had a name, tho. "Lauren A"

"Kitchen" or "Basement", bored, i picked basement. I was ready to close the shitty thing till i saw the new one, making me tremble a little. I always hated this type of gaming.

"Knife" or "Gun", what type of questions are this? I clicked knife, checking any place at my computer since i was kinda freaked out. Something here was off. Really off. It was 2AM, i was all alone.

"Kill" or "Save", and it was obviously to get at save but i couldnt. Some sick prick it was getting rejecting, the button moving while i tried to catch it. I gived up, choosing kill and waiting again. 

This time, one weird sound get into my headphones. Like a child crying, really distant and weak. I clicked again at the shadow girl, and popped up an request to open an new tab. I get nervous. I accepted, even if its so so dumb but i couldnt just go away and dont see it. It was clearly an jpeg, poor quality, and it was at the end of the url.

I tried to download the image to see it better, or take screenshot but didnt work. Didnt let me. It was an basement (?) really dark and dirty. I couldnt see a girl or a knife, but looked like an faked or photoshopped strange picture of some creepypasta. I chilled a bit.

But then another tab opened, and another, and another.

It was an section, an girl craving her way under the dark, looking sick. There's a man with her, but i didnt see her face or hands, i start shaking. It looked like a fricking stop motion, it was worrifying, he grabbed her hair and used the knife. Tabs open like a fucking crazy, i was stunned, couldnt move or say a thing, i saw and hear and whisper and took the headphones right away. Thats when, seeing the blood and the corpse of a teen girl... I delete the website, i was shaking. What type of fucking game was that? It was an acting, right? Why it looked so fucking real?

I breath out, it was an jumpscare fucking real. And only. It was only an stupid fucking joke, and its okay. But i cant stop thinking about the scene. And thinking it must had an hidden option, if its just a game, i killed her. I killed her. Thats all. 

It gave me a fucking time to relax, and try to forgot. I tried to play again but the site was vanished, it wasnt working, 404 and it was like nothing ever happened. I tried into my cousin phone, my best friend computer, and i couldnt. It was like nothing. It was like a fucking nightmare.

Lauren A wasnt a person. Lauren wasnt even someone, it was a fucking stupid prank. But why she keep looking at me at my window? Why i keep seeing her? WHY SHES LOOKING AT ME RIGHT FUCKING NOW.

Dont you ever play Habsuru, but if you do, please save her. Free her. Help me.
