It took me some time to come to. I don’t know how long it took me to become conscious, but time had passed. 

I was walking when I became conscious. We were in the woods now, hiking on a trail. It was an easy trail, a beginner one. That was hardly the point.

The others were quiet, and by quiet, I mean dead silent. There were no sounds of exertion or no sounds of breathing. They weren’t the only things that were silent. Aside from the crunch of the gravel and leaves and the shuddering of my own breath, there was no sound of wildlife. There was hardly a single chirp from a bird. It was as if the world was on mute. 



Their backs were to me, and they were marching at unexpected speed. 



Something was wrong with them now. They weren’t the same as they were before. They knew about my dream, which I was starting to suspect wasn’t just a dream. 



Of course, it wasn’t a dream. That’s what they told me before I passed out, right?



But they were my only way of knowing what was going on. 



I bit my tongue from speaking. What if I just left? They can’t see me, and they don’t know that I gained consciousness. These people, they aren’t my friends. Whoever they are, I do not know them. I can leave now with no guilty conscience. 

  


I slowed down slightly, looking to my right to see if there was any path. To my delight, there was a path that seemed to lead down the hill. I turned back and my stomach dropped.



All three of them had turned back to look at me. No, that wasn’t right.



Their heads had turned back to look at me. Their eyes were bleeding, carved out improperly, leaving jagged pits. Their mouths were smiling all too wide and all too black like they painted their teeth with tar. 



Come on, Shreya, I thought, trying to sike myself up. I couldn’t scream. My mouth was too dry. For some reason I didn’t stop walking and neither did they. 



Their necks seemed broken.



Breath was short and in short gasps. I felt like I was swallowing my own lungs.



“What’s going on?” My voice broke the silence like a magnet through iron. I tried to keep it steady. I shut my eyes, fearing the worst.



“What do you mean?” Marcus sounded like he usually did. It was one relief. I thought he would sound demonic. I peeked my eyes open.



Their backs were once again to me. So were their heads, thankfully. It was as if they never even turned.



“Why are we outside? We were in the cabin, how are we here?” They turned back towards me, having the audacity to look confused. I flinched, expecting the warped perverted faces of before. Their faces… were the same.



“What are you talking about? We left the cabin yesterday.” Sarah said, reaching out. Her hands were cold.



“What are you talking about? We stayed overnight. We were there and then I blacked out after waking up and now I’m here. What the fuck is going on?”



They shared glances. 

“Are you alright?”



“I’m not crazy, man. I know what I’m talking about.” Jake looked back, his face contorting into one of concern. No, it wasn’t that. It looked like concern, but I could see the disdain and smugness. 



“We left after you started breaking down. The car started after some time and we left. Do… do you not remember this?”



“You have to believe me,” I demanded, but they only looked more and more concerned. “I’m not crazy.”

  


“Shreya, are you paranoid? Are you experiencing those hallucinations again?” I frowned and let out a deep breath. They usually never mentioned my mental illness so blatantly. 



“No, this isn’t that. This was real. You aren’t understanding me, something isn’t right here!”



“We have been walking for over an hour. We can’t turn back now.” We’d been walking for an hour, and yet we were so far within the woods. The trees were now needle-like, tall, and imposing with no greenery. It started to look more like the aftermath of a forest fire rather than a forest. The trail was becoming more and more spare, and I could feel myself tripping over rocks and roots. The others were fine, still moving despite looking at me. Even the clutz, Jake, was moving fine. This was the same man who tripped over the air and broke his front teeth.



This wasn’t right. Why was I reasoning with them? Something was clearly wrong with them. Fuck.



“Let me rephrase. What was I talking about walking up the path?” I stopped my walking and stood. They didn’t stop, not for a good distance. When they did decide to stop, there was a sound, similar to the screeching of metal. They didn’t stop all at once. It was as if a machine was stopping, slowly. The sound seemed to echo in my ears.



“Why stop?” Sarah asked except it wasn’t really Sarah. It spoke wearing her. Her eyes were quickly blackened and her mouth didn’t move but the voice echoed from within like a dummy in the hands of an invisible ventriloquist. 



“It stops. Why stops?” The voice coming from Jake was something I would never be able to forget. There was a bit of Jake’s own voice in there. The other parts of the voice sounded like it was in a different language. Sounded almost like nonsense. But the loudest part of the voice was static. It was loud, overwhelming, and seeped into my mind like water into a tissue. My breathing, heartbeat, and even my blood seemed to be stopped. There was only static. I could feel my right leg move forward, and then my left, and then again.



I was walking.



The static stopped only when I was face-to-face with Jake.

They too moved forward. 



My mouth would not open.

  
  


It seemed like hours we walked. My stomach burned in hunger, and my legs were shaking nonstop. My feet ached and bled. My throat was dry. Tear streaks were dried on my face. Somewhere along the way, I remember crying, but there was no use. I only lost water. 

We were well into the mountain range. Trudging through the snow, my legs shook in cold and exertion. My pants were wet, as I was still in yesterday’s clothes. My toes were now warm. They were probably frostbitten and blue.



And still I walked. 



They walked in the front, their backs to me.



Somewhere along the way, there was a mountain lion. It growled, possibly in hunger. It didn't matter to me.

It ran and attacked Marcus, talking off his arm. I didn't see what happened, or rather I didn't understand it. But within the next moment, the mountain lion was dead on the snow, entrails decorating the ground around it.  I, of course, had the pleasure of not being able to scream. I watched as Marcus's blood was expelled by his body, first gushing without end. Eventually, the flow slowed, until there was nothing to empty. He was but a lifeless husk, and he kept walking. 



I don't know how long it was since then. Marcus was decomposing, his face was rotting away, albeit slowly due to the cold. I myself should have been dead long back. I could not feel my feet any longer. The hunger died away, coming only in pangs. I lost the ability to excrete. I lost the ability to speak, my throat lacking water and being closed off due to the cold. My fingers were black. I didn't need to see a mirror to know that my nose and cheeks were now black. 

  
But the sun set and rose all the same, mocking my eternal walk as if I were some modern Sisyphus, trying to complete some never ending task. Perhaps the better comparison would have been Prometheus, punished for assisting humanity. 

  
One day, I do not know when, my mouth was released from its invisible binding.

  
It took sometime to find my voice.

My voice was a croak when I spoke.



"How long has it been?" It was not more than a whisper.

  
"Only a week." came the reply, but I do not know whose voice it was. I have forgotten what they sound like. 

  
I nodded.

  
There was no hunger anymore. There was no thirst. I no longer stood still. I walked.



  


Oh, how I longed to starve to death.
