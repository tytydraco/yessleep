Thalassophobia is the fear or phobia of large and deep bodies of water. These can be lakes, rivers, or the ocean. It’s become more mainstream in the last couple of years, games like Subnautica or Iron Lung have shown people the extent of those fears. It reminds me of something from my teenage years or should I say someone.   
  
Charles was my friend and he had thalassophobia, like many people with the phobia Charles was brought on by trauma. When he was only 8 years old his father attempted to drown him. I didn’t know that at the time. But to my friend group, Charles was the kid who was scared to go swimming.  We tried several times to take him swimming and he’d always fight him on it. If we could get him to go he’d sit on the sidelines. One day someone had the bright idea to force him to conquer his fears. So we drove him to where we’d commonly go cliff diving. Blindfolded him and took him to the top. He fought us at first but I convinced him to jump, and we all jumped. As I looked at him treading water he had a smile on his face. But just as quickly as the fun started it ended, Charles went under the water and never came back. The authorities chalked it up to him drowning but none of us were convinced he was pulled. They never found his body.  
  
See to me the fear never came from what was in the water but what could come out. I just finished my most recent case and the creature I’d been hunting had the highest kill count of anything I've encountered. I was one of 4 agents placed on this case which is unusual for the organization and is one of the few cases I've been on with more than two agents. There was me, a level 2 field agent, Flamingo level 2 field agent, recruit Sim, a level 4 field agent, and Trojan, a level 1 field agent. I’d never worked with Flamingo and Sim was assigned under me for this case. It was his first case.   
  
“Oh man this is nerve-racking,” said Sim.  
   
We were driving to a diner nearby from the case location. Here we’d meet with Flamingo and Trojan.  
  
“First cases are like that,” I said  
  
“Why do they call him Trojan according to everyone at training he's a big deal but no one knew where the name came from.”  
  
I chuckled “I’m afraid it’s not cause he’s a badass or anything.”  
  
“So he’s not a badass.”  
  
“No he’s a badass, just ask him and I guarantee he’ll show you.”  
  
The diner looked like every roadside diner you’d ever seen, we usually choose places like this when Trojan and I worked together. Man loves three things in the world and the first one is food. Walking in I saw Trojan and who I assumed was Flamingo in a booth.  
  
“Pepper great working with you again,” said Trojan  
  
“Nice to meet you both,” said Flamingo.  
  
They had already ordered food, Trojan knew what I liked.   
  
“It’s confusing though for something they deemed so dangerous to send us all out why would they have us bring a recruit,” Flamingo said.  
  
“It was a last-minute thing, I haven’t even got a case file and was hoping you’d share yours,” I said.  
  
“Of course,” Trojan slid a file across the table.  
  
I picked it up first and was shocked at what I was reading It was a campground and a very popular one, not the first one I've been to. But this one from what I was reading shouldn’t even be open.  
  
“This can’t be right,” I said.  
  
“Yeah I thought it was a mistake too,” Said Flamingo.  
  
312 missing persons in the last year, this place stayed warm year-round and was very famous, people from all over the world came to visit. But in no world should this place still be open. I handed the file off to Sim and he seemed just as surprised.  
  
“You can see why they wanted all of us, normally they'd just send me,” Trojan said.  
  
I spent the rest of the meal going over the file with Sim.  
  
Arriving at the camp we were to meet with an organization plant who worked as a forest ranger. The organization placed several people in different national parks. Parks can be a breeding ground for entities. The park grounds surrounded a large beautiful lake people were kayaking in it and everyone around looked like they were having fun. I was just pissed they still had it open. I was asked to meet with the ranger while the others unpacked our stuff to put it in the cabins we were generously given for the case duration.  
  
“You fish?” I confusedly asked  
  
“I know the names fucking stupid,” He said  
  
“Ain’’t the dumbest one I've heard,” I said  
  
“Look I gotta make this brief I may work for the organization but I still got a park to manage,” He said.  
  
“I understand.”  
  
“Somethings taking people in the night and despite my protest, we can’t get them to close the damn place down. It ain’t uncommon for people to go missing but we used to get 20 or so a year, not 300, I don’t know why it took the organization so long to send you guys. We have a body that ain’t the first one found either it’s over in a shed off to the east. We also have someone who claims to have seen some creature in the ranger station. I suggest you all start on those,” He said.  
  
“I appreciate the information.”  
  
I made my way to the cabin to meet the others. Entering the cabin I heard Sim ask.  
  
“Why do they call you Trojan it’s killing me to know.”  
  
Flamingo and I started laughing, while Trojan pulled out his wallet. He reached in and pulled out a condom a Trojan condom. Sim stood there looking pissed.  
  
“Your fucking kidding me,” Sim said.  
  
“I dropped this once and no one would let me live it down,” Trojan said.  
  
“So what did you fuck a Flamingo for your name,” Sim said.  
  
“No,” Flamingo said pulling up his pant leg to reveal a flamingo tattoo.  
  
“So what’s your story,” Sim said staring at me.  
  
“Maybe I’ll tell you one day.”  
  
I shared the information with them. We decided to split Sim and I would check on the corpse and the others would interview the person in the station. Sim seemed nervous as we walked up to the shed. I opened it from what I’d been told the smell was horrible. Sim threw up, It didn’t affect me. The person had several broken bones, their limbs were bent in a direction that was not possible. Their skin had been somewhat dissolved. I’d seen stuff like this before the body had been eaten and regurgitated.   
  
“So it’s overeating,” I said.  
  
“How can you tell?” Sim said trying to recover from his nausea.  
  
“The body has been partially digested but whatever did this threw it up, that leads me to think the creature has always kind of been here.”  
  
“I’m not getting it,” Sim said.  
  
“The park normally gets 40 or so missing persons a year, most of those are probably from the creature but this year the missing persons have drastically increased. I don’t think that’s the fault of the creature.”  
  
“Something’s helping it then?” asked Sim.  
  
“Bingo.”  
  
We met back with the others to exchange information, according to the person who had seen a monster. Several nights ago he watched as a human-like creature with legs that seemed like jellyfish tendrils, came from the lake and wrapped its tendrils around the person and pulled them into the lake.   
  
“Did they mention seeing anyone else?” I asked.  
  
“No, that's all the info they gave us said it was too dark to discern anything,” said Flamingo.  
  
“I think we start patrolling the lake at night to see what we can find,” said Trojan.   
  
I had to take Sim with me, I couldn’t let him go on dying. The rest of us split up. We followed the edge of the water. Sim pointed out footprints leading down the lake. We followed them, they led us to a man. Sim foolishly yelled at the man to get down with his gun drawn. The man ran off into the woods and we were unable to follow. I reprimanded him, where the man was standing there were imprints in the dirt similar to snake tracks. Trojan found tracks similar to the ones we found We met back at the cabin close to the morning to discuss our findings, but one of us was missing. Flamingo didn’t return.  
  
2 nights passed, and we waited for him. Sim looked like he was going insane waiting, he couldn’t help but feel guilty like somehow he was the reason Flamingo was missing. It didn’t bother me or Trojan.   
  
“We can’t keep sitting here waiting,” I said.  
  
“I agree we’ll head out tonight,” Trojan said.   
  
 Sim didn’t like it and I didn’t like him going. Sim’s young and this case seemed too much for a starting case. The night came and I asked Trojan to take Sim, he had much more experience than I. I returned to the spot where we saw the man and to my surprise he was there. I called out to him and turned to me.   
“The violent one isn’t with you,” He said.  
  
“I got him working with someone else.”  
  
“You're here investigating the deaths aren’t you.”  
  
I was getting closer to the man I could pick out his details now, he was normal, with blonde hair and average height wearing jeans and a blue hoody.   
  
“Do you know anything about them, the deaths I mean,” I said.  
  
“I am the one feeding Dagon, your friend made a great sacrifice.”  
  
I was a few feet from now. Did I hear him right? He was feeding the creature and was calling him Dagon. The fish god. Flamingo that must have been my friend he was talking about. I had my hand on my revolver now.   
  
“Goodbye,” The man said  
  
Just then I felt something around my ankle. I was being pulled into the lake. I barely had time to take a breath. I fought back against the thing around my ankle. Completely under the water, I could feel the creature enveloping me. Desperately trying to reach for my knife in my belt, I was getting dragged around the bottom of the water and I could tell my arm was bleeding. I could feel the tips of my fingers on the handle of my knife. But once again I was jerked around moving me away. Forcing me to restart the journey to my knife. I got my blade barely I began stabbing at the tentacles. They let go and I began desperately trying to swim toward the surface I had no air in my lungs. I was taking in water, just then another tentacle took me and I had no air to fight back. I thought of Flamingo and how this is what it felt like while he was dying. Light began leaving my eyes and if it wasn’t for the angel Trojan I'd be dead. I watched with my final bit of sight as the creature met the blade of the Trojan.  
  
I woke up on land to Sim attempting to give me CPR.  
  
“You can stop now,” I said coughing up water.  
  
“Oh god you're alive,” he said.   
  
I looked over to see Trojan next to the same creature that had taken me. He had filet the creature and inside were the remains of Flamingo and two others. I didn’t know him well but someone so experienced getting so easily was scary. I didn’t even realize the creature was there until it grabbed me so I could see how it got him. How I didn’t notice though was the worst part it was a massive 23 feet at least. Each tentacle was almost 10 feet long. It was brown matching the color of the lake. It had 6 eyes and its mouth was right above the tentacles. It looked like a squid somewhat but had fins as well. Never seen anything like it. We began hearing yelling.  
  
“NO YOU BASTARDS, HOW COULD YOU KILL THE LORD LIKE THAT OH YOU BE PUNISHED SEVERELY YOU FUCKING-”  
  
The Voice was cut off by Trojan who knocked him out, it was the same man I talked to. We called the organization in to clean up the creature. The man was taken in by the organization where he was interrogated he admitted to helping feed which he called Dagon. But claimed he was being controlled by it. If that’s true then it is a first for me. Sim decided to leave the organization claiming he wasn't cut out for the organization. I'm glad he left I wouldn’t want him to end up like me. I did almost die that reminded me of my humanity. I can’t leave the organization at this point. I spent a large part of my life here, And honestly, I can tell I don't have much time left.
