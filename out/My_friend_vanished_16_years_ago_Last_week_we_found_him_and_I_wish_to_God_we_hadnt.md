My name is Bobby Simmons. I’m a research analyst, a pretty boring job, all things considered. I deal in data and predictable outcomes. But for the past few weeks, my life has been anything but predictable. My friends and I have a piece of another dimension pulsing in a containment unit in a basement lab, and I’m writing this down because I need people to know what’s out there. I need to warn you.

It started sixteen years ago, on the last day of summer vacation. We were just five kids soaking up the last moments of freedom in our small town of Merrygrove. There was Tyler, the loud one trying to act grown up; Jaycee, the tough athlete who hated being called a girl; Brixton, the playful nerd ; and Esperanza “Espy” Del Rio, the girl who had brought me, the awkward new kid, into their circle. She was our leader, the one who held us all together.

That evening, Brixton was chanting a stupid rhyme his mom got from one of her paranormal podcasts. "When the sky goes dark and the fog rolls low, watch out for the tethers, it's time to go!".

We laughed it off and took a shortcut through the Alabaster Patch, a stretch of woods near the river. That’s when the air grew cold. A thick, unnatural fog rolled in, swallowing everything. A deafening crack of lightning struck a nearby oak, and just as fast as it appeared, the fog vanished. Hanging from the tree was a tendril of deep, impossible blue light.

Brixton was mesmerized. Espy screamed for him to get away, but it was too late. There was a sound like a wet whip cracking through the air, and he was yanked up into the canopy and gone. For a second, the sky lit up, and we saw it—a vast, sprawling silhouette against the stars, something too big to be real.

Jaycee’s phone was dead. All of our electronics were. We told the police what we saw. They found his shoe, but they didn’t believe us. Brixton was listed as a runaway, then a missing person. His parents never recovered. And the four of us… we just drifted apart, shattered by a memory too insane to share with anyone else.

For sixteen years, I tried to forget. I buried myself in work, in logic, in science. Then, a few weeks ago, Tyler called me. He’d heard from Espy. She sent a message for me, a code we’d made as kids for our walkie-talkies, the rhyme we’d invented for when things went terribly wrong: “the crow calls thrice, but the rooster only twice, when it is time, we must pick up the grains like rice”.

She needed us back in Merrygrove. She’d never stopped searching for answers and believed she found a way to get Brixton back.

So we went. The four of us, together for the first time since that night. Espy had teamed up with a paranormal expert she’d met online named Amrit. He’d found similar stories in ancient folklore from all over the world—myths of a “Sky God” that descends when the world is imbalanced, casting down tethers to take and give life.

That night, we went back into those same woods, armed with walkie-talkies, supplies, and Espy’s handgun. It happened again. The fog, the cold, the lightning. The tethers—long, rope-like tentacles—came down from the trees, glowing with that same electric blue light. This time, however, they were hunting us. Tyler and Amrit were caught, wrapped in glowing green ropes, and thrown thirty feet through the air before vanishing.

Just as we thought all was lost, our walkie-talkie crackled to life. It was Brixton. His voice was faint, distorted. He told us he was alive, trapped in another dimension he called the “Crossroads”. He said the tethers were inter-dimensional highways, and that we could follow him if we grabbed one and truly believed we wanted to find him.

Espy and I made a choice. We told Jaycee to get help for the others and then we ran for a lone, blue tether hanging in the air. We grabbed on and stepped into the light.

We landed in a massive treehouse that was bigger on the inside, a structure that defied physics. Thousands of tethers pulsed on the walls like living vines. And there was Brixton. He was still twelve years old. He told us time is suspended there; his mind was 28, but his body never aged. He’d been trapped for sixteen years, hiding from a cosmic being he called Dr. Insano.

Dr. Insano, Brixton explained, had been manipulating events in our dimension—like the recent flash floods in Merrygrove—to throw things out of balance and lure out the Sky God, hoping to use its tethers to invade our world.

Then Dr. Insano found us. He was a tall, horrifying figure in a tattered lab coat, with glowing red eyes and a voice like grinding stones . We ran, Brixton leading us on a terrifying chase through the tethers. We jumped through a dimension of unicorns with shark teeth , another where mud-people were being absorbed by a giant tree , and a sterile, white infinity where a man’s tattoos crawled off his skin.

Each time, Insano followed, taunting that every tether led back to him. We finally made it back to the treehouse, cornered. But I remembered what he said. He had followed us back. He’d used his return trip. He was trapped with us.

I had Tyler’s can of bear spray. I used my lighter and turned it into a makeshift flamethrower, aiming for the base of the tether Dr. Insano had just used. It shrieked and wrapped itself around him, dragging him back into his own portal with a sickening crunch .

We found the tether that led home. Brixton came with us. At the edge of the forest, his mother was waiting with Jaycee. Their reunion was the most heartbreaking thing I’ve ever seen. He was her son, but he was also a ghost from sixteen years in the past. He couldn’t stay. He gave her a walkie-talkie, promising they could still talk across dimensions sometimes, before he stepped back into the portal and was gone .

Now, we’re back. Tyler and Amrit are recovering. The piece of tether I cut off is in the lab Espy and I built in her basement. It’s a living organism, a key to a map of infinite worlds. Brixton was right; for every hell, there must be a heaven. The problem is, they're all connected.

We’re going back. We have to understand what this is, and we have to make sure nothing like Dr. Insano ever finds its way through again. But I’m terrified. We’ve opened a door to a reality of infinite possibilities, and we have no idea what else is waiting on the other side.

So if the air in your town suddenly grows cold, if you see fog rolling in when there’s no storm, get inside. Lock your doors. And if your radio crackles to life with a child’s rhyme… don’t listen. It’s not for you. It’s a warning.
