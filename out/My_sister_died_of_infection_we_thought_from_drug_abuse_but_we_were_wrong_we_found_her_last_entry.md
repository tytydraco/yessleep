I’ve wanted to be a mom since I was very young, always playing with dolls playing house I just wanted that nice picket fence family. 

As I grew older I started having sex younger than I should have, I just needed to feel life inside of me I wanted to be a mom it is in my blood to be a mom everything has lead me up to this in my life… yet as cruel as Mother Nature can be she took away my ability to carry a child.

I suspected something was wrong when I never had a teen pregnancy scare I never had to poke holes in condoms I never had to talk them into protection they just didn’t use it.

I caught an STI somewhere when I was younger and the doctor said it going untreated for so long could’ve been the reason for me not being able to carry a child, I didn’t sleep or eat and went into a depressive state where I started using drugs.

First it was cocaine and alcohol at a party then it quickly went to me injecting heroin and meth and prostituting myself I wasn’t even doing it for the drugs I was left an inheritance enough where I could’ve bought a child off someone and lived lavishly the rest of my life but I needed to carry the life myself MY body needed to bring them to life I wanted to feel the movement the sickness I wanted it all.

I was picking up drugs from the projects and in a rundown apartment while I was waiting for the dealer I saw some old food with flies and fly eggs and it gave me an idea.

I know what you’re thinking but I needed to experience giving life and all the feelings just once god please have mercy on me.

I got home and immediately shot up my drugs and booked an in call, not to be disgusting but I let him have at every one of my orifices and finish inside me this carried on the next few days and i was leaking what I assume was rotten semen from many of my donors, how sweet I thought to myself they would soon be daddies as well all 20 of them…

I went out to the dumpster behind my house and laid in it spreading my legs it wasn’t long before the flies swarmed the gooey, slimy, stinky goop coming off my heated moist  body was heaven for them, as soon as I was certain the job was done my own sick IVF therapy the eggs were implanted.

I scooped the old semen and bodily fluids into my vagina hoping the eggs would make it, I went home and laid in bed with an excitement rushing over me I was going to finally be a mom, something I helped grow and come to life this was finally happening.

Within a few hours the fever and vomiting started but I embraced it all a part of motherhood, I started oozing this white goop from my vagina, I quickly scooped it up knowing this was another gift when my babies are squirming their way out of my body this would be their milk to sustain them.

20 hours later I felt the wiggly and squirming and i finally felt alive, a gush of puss, semen, and infection poured out of me birthing my maggot babies into the world.

I laid the milky goop from earlier and put it on my breasts scooping up my babies I laid them down on my nipples what I assume suckling felt like as there were hundreds of them squirming and moving.

I write this now in my bed of bodily fluids any and every you can think of I can’t move or get up so anytime I need to use the bathroom I just go, I had drop by clients and sadly while I am in this state some of them assuming I’m dead would run others would do what they came for, the stench has gotten unbearable and my grandchildren flying around the room must have learned from their parents how to eat I try swatting them away but I am far too weak.

They started using each hole or opening in my body to lay their eggs, the stench and the moist goop is too hard to resist… using voice to text as my eyes have crusted over from infection.

My mother always told me we make sacrifices being a mother. I finally got to understand
