[Preview case](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/VxewXXhKQa)

So, how was your week? Hopefully less eventful than mine. 

We urgently need to discuss the dangers presented by crossroads, especially with the temperatures dropping. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

To begin, I want to clarify that when I say ‘crossroads,’ I don't mean any intersection that you come across. If that were the case, most urbanized or suburban areas would be saturated with these types of places. An infested crossroads can best be described as an in-between space. It's not just one road cutting through, or even two. It is both roads at once, yet at the same time, the intersection can't truly belong to either one of those that feed into it. Because of this quality, they attract all sorts of oddities. 

They seem to occur mainly in rural areas, often places where blood has been spilled. During the day, these locations are generally safe, but they become more treacherous between sunset and sunrise, especially at midnight. This is thought to be due to the fact that those times I’ve just mentioned are also transitory periods: sunset and sunrise are between night and morning, and midnight is the change from one day into another. I hope that makes sense. 

If this description seems confusing or vague, don't worry. You'll be able to feel these infested crossroads when you encounter them. And most of the time, as long as you keep driving and mind your own business, you won't experience any trouble by simply passing through. More often than not, they're just trying to get from point A to point B, same as you. 

When I get into what happened to me on Friday, I will describe that feeling so that yinz know what to look out for. 

So, what kind of atypical organisms hang around this habitat? It tends to vary depending on region. For example, one of the pest control companies down in Georgia frequently has to deal with devils at their infested crossroads, mostly targeting musicians. Meanwhile, our crossroads appear to be a rest stop, of sorts. We don't get too many that linger for more than a day or two. Most of the time, these things tend to mind their own business. As long as you don’t bother them, they won’t bother you.

That being said, some are more predisposed to aggression than others. Our most dangerous travelers tend to appear during winter. When it snows, you can see silhouettes. Sometimes they look humanoid, other times, the shapes are long and writhing. And if you're unlucky enough to find yourself close to them, you can see faces outlined by the falling snowflakes. 

For whatever reason, these Snow People only appear during when, you guessed it, snow is actively falling. The heavier the snowfall, the more prominent they become. 

While driving, the Snow People can be extremely difficult to spot. They have been known to mess with cars in a variety of ways from relatively minor (but still dangerous) inconveniences such as generating thick sheets of ice near infested intersections, to more severe assaults. 

I experienced the latter while driving back to the office during an early morning call last Friday. It was just past dawn, so the sun had only begun to ascend into the sky. 

Gripping the steering wheel tighter, I slowed down as I approached the stop sign, mentally preparing myself for the worst as I reached what I knew was an infested crossroads.  

Have you ever found yourself in a remote area, looking for more than just cars as you wait? Knowing that there is something else out there, even if you can’t see it? The air has an electric feel to it, as if there is a storm looming overhead. You become more alert as the hairs on the back of your neck start to rise. Shadows seem longer and darker, no matter what time of day, as you check the intersection once. Twice. Three times. But no matter where you look, there’s still nothing there. Or it’s just hiding.

*That* is what an infested crossroads feels like. It’s a sensation you can’t forget once you experience it. 

My eyes darted around the intersection. Snowflakes lightly danced across the trucks's hood. Out where I was, there weren't any street lights to give me much visibility in the early morning light. The wheat fields swayed in the wind, illuminated only by the company truck's headlights. 

With how early it was, there weren't any cars around. I watched the snow carefully, not seeing any shapes. There were no signs of danger that I could see, but that didn't mean that I was safe. 

Just as I started to accelerate, the company truck bounced violently enough to make the suspension squeak. 

My breath caught when I glanced into the rearview mirror. *The bed.* Something had climbed into the bed.  

I stepped on it while turning the wheel from side to side, hoping that my unwelcome passenger would lose its balance and tumble out. The truck's tires screeched, skidding on a light patch of ice, but thankfully regaining traction. The frame rocked some more as whatever was back there held on, pulling itself towards the rear window. In the mirror, there was only a heavy shape outlined by the snowflakes whizzing past. 

Once I got some speed, I slammed on the brakes, hearing the visitor falter and bump into the back of the cab. The tires complained again as I then put the gas pedal to the metal. Afterwards, there were a series of loud thumps leading away from the cab as the thing rolled out. 

In the faint glow provided by the truck's tail lights, I caught a glimpse of the Snow Person using what looked to be a hook-like appendage to catch onto what I would later learn was the truck's rear axle. Swearing, I swerved, trying to wrench it loose. When the Snow Person roared, it sounded like it was trying its best to imitate a human scream, though with how flat and low the tone was, it missed the mark, causing goosebumps to appear on my arms. 

There was an ear-splitting screech as metal bent. The truck had begun to wobble. I hit the brakes again, then threw it in reverse in the hopes of running my assailant over. The truck bounced violently as I backed up on top of the Snow Person, then again when I shifted back into drive. 

As I made my daring escape, there was a sticky blue substance smeared all over the road. That’s one way to take care of a Snow Person, I suppose. However, I also noticed a problem as I navigated away from the intersection: something was grinding. I'm not a car person by any stretch of the imagination, but even I knew it was a bad sound for a truck to make.

And I was in the middle of nowhere. 

I drove it as far away from the crossroads as the truck could manage, wanting to get as much distance on the Snow People as possible. Our poor company vehicle shuddered the entire time, steadily beginning to feel worse and worse with each passing meter. I was cursing up a storm and crossing my fingers, nervously checking the mirrors, on high alert for any more shapes in the snow. There weren’t any nearby, thankfully.

Eventually, I got too scared to try to push it any further. After I finally gave in and stopped, the first thing I did was lock the doors, then I called Victor to let him know what happened. 

After saying that he'd be out as soon as he could, he voiced my thoughts perfectly: “Fucking Snow People…”

Yeah. We *love* them back at the office. They're a pain in the ass. I'm so glad they're only a seasonal issue. 

Unlike other atypical beings that reside around these parts, we have yet to find a way to deal with Snow People in a way that doesn't end in violence. As demonstrated, they attack without any provocation. They’ve been known to drag people from their cars, never to be seen again.  

Allow me to reiterate: if yinz see shapes in the snow, *get as far away as possible.* 

Other protective measures include salt (who could’ve seen that coming?) as well as anything else you could use to melt the snow outlining their bodies. Namely, fire has been effective for the larger, less humanoid Snow People. 

As far as the truck dilemma went, my problems weren't resolved yet. The next step was to find a towing company. Unfortunately, most of them didn't open until later in the morning. But there was one 24 hour towing service that I knew of, and I *really* did not want to dial them up. 

Warily, I glanced back towards the crossroads. While I couldn't see anything, we saw how well that went for me last time. Before making the call, I anxiously double checked that my fake ID was still in my wallet, despite knowing I never left home without it. After the mechanic learned my father's name with something as innocuous as a car title, the idea of some other slip up occurring has haunted me. 

I really, *really* should go back to therapy. However, that takes time and money, and at the moment, I'm short on both.

When I called Dubnos Towing, it wasn't Briar that answered, to my relief. It was a deep-voiced, monotone woman who sounded as if she was positively thrilled to be awake and working this early in the day.  

After I explained the situation, I politely asked, “Is it possible to know the name of the driver picking me up beforehand?”

“Sure.” She answered flatly. “It's Chuck.”

Recalling that Briar's nickname was embroidered onto his work shirt, I started to relax until it occurred to me that there was no guarantee that ‘Chuck’ was human. Or the woman I spoke to on the phone, for that matter. On high alert, I gave her the name on my fake ID, telling her where the truck had broken down at. 

However, at the same time, what Wild Huntsman would go by the name *Chuck?*

(Disclaimer: if there is anyone reading this named Chuck, I swear, I’m not making fun of you. It’s just not an alias I’d expect a powerful Neighbor to pick.)

Thankfully, she accepted the fraudulent name without hesitation, informing me that Chuck would be there in about half an hour. Cool. Just had to hope nothing else from the crossroads decided to have a go at me. 

For the most part, Snow People don't stray too far from the crossroads. I just hoped I was far enough away that none of them could reach me to finish what the one had started. 

And before yinz ask where the Snow People come from or what causes them to be drawn towards certain crossroads, let me save you the trouble: nobody knows. All that is understood about them is that they're elusive, highly malevolent, and can only appear during an active snowfall. Now, you all know as much as I do.

While waiting inside the truck with nothing to do but try to stay warm as I stared vacantly at the gray sky, I found myself becoming somewhat antsy, due to my circumstances. Granted, I think it's fair to say that constant paranoia is part of the job description of an Orion employee. 

*Should probably turn the lights off. Don’t need the battery dying on top of whatever else is going on.*

As I reached for the stick thing behind the steering wheel to turn off the headlights, something caught my attention. Eyes in the wheat field nearby. They reflected the headlights. An animal? 

I furrowed my brow, pulling back on the stick to turn on the truck’s brights. *Oh, fuck.* 

Whatever was in the wheat, there was more than one of them. 

The plants couldn’t have much more than four feet in height. Even though my mysterious audience would’ve been roughly the same height as a typical kindergartner, that wasn’t any comfort. Terrible things can come in small packages, especially where the Neighbors are concerned. 

Telling myself they were just coyotes, I turned the lights off. The doors were locked. I had salt. I had Ratcatcher. Vic was on his way. Everything was going to be fine. Yet, my hands were shaking, and it wasn’t from the cold.

Half a paranoia-filled hour later, I saw flashing yellow lights standing out against the gloom of the day. Squinting against them, I recognized the black tow truck accented with blue lightning. The wheat rustled as those that were hiding within it retreated. Dubnos is prompt, I’ll give them that. 

When the driver emerged, the first thing I saw was a reflective high-visibility jacket that practically glowed against the gloom of the day. The driver had his hood up. His build was, unfortunately, familiar. A pit appeared in my stomach as he got closer, revealing that Briar was the one who'd showed up after all. 

His eyelids looked heavy, face drawn in exhaustion. In short, he looked *done.*

Rubbing his eyes, he knocked on the company truck's driver side window with the knuckles of two fingers to greet me, his voice raspy, “Good morning, to all those who celebrate.”

Reluctantly, I rolled it down as I balked, “I thought it was supposed to be-”

“Well, Chuckie’s wife went into labor, so it got pawned off onto me. And I was supposed to be off an hour ago. Overtime for the second week in a row, yee-*fucking*-haw!”

Clearly, Briar was having a normal one. With the mental state he was in, I thought it best not to provoke him. Without another word, I removed Ratcatcher from the passenger side, then handed him the truck's keys without fuss so that he could do his job. All the while, I was quietly hoping that Vic would get there sooner rather than later. 

While I'm not as intimidated by Briar as I am his superior, I'll admit that I still don't feel safe around him. Those thorn scratches were still healing, after all. 

While messing with chains and other towing doohickeys that I don’t care enough to look up the proper names for, he made casual smalltalk about how he had to come out to the crossroads recently to pick up someone who hit a nasty pothole that nearly ate their car. 

I didn't bother hiding my skepticism at his unexpected amiability. He broke character to sigh impatiently, “Don't look at me with that face. I'm on the clock. It'd be a bit suspicious if I went to pick you up and something happened to you, wouldn't it?”

That was true. 

He continued, “Right now, you're just my customer and I'm your friendly neighborhood tow truck driver. Nothing weird.”

Once he was done, he looked at me expectantly. Seeing if I accepted this temporary truce or if I wanted to send him off and wait for another towing company to come out there.

Eventually, I nodded, albeit reluctantly, and agreed, “Nothing weird.”

After that, he went back to doing his relatively harmless day job. Even so, I kept an eye on him at all times. 

The tow truck began to roar as it pulled our company vehicle onto its massive bed. Anxiously, I risked looking away from Briar to briefly check my phone. Nothing from the boss yet. God, where was he?

“So, while I've got you here,” Briar began, his tone mild as if he were planning to keep talking about mundane things like potholes. “There's something that's been confusing me about you. Your colleagues, too.”

Brow furrowed, I replied, “And what's that?”

“It would've been so easy to just let the hag take care of us. So, why didn't you?”

That seemed to come from nowhere, but it must've been on his mind for a while. Such heavy questions don't just spawn from the void. 

Caught off guard, it took me a minute to think of the best way to respond. Eventually, I settled for open honesty, “I can't speak for anyone else, but personally, I've seen a lot of pain in my life. Because of that, I have this weird thing where I don't like seeing others suffer, you and your colleagues included.”

He snorted rudely, the ‘friendly neighborhood tow truck driver act' momentarily forgotten, “Sounds fake, but alright.”

“You'd know if I was lying.” I pointed out somewhat defensively. “And like it or not, that's what happened. You don't have to agree with it, but it's the truth. 

He let out a harsh breath, becoming intensely focused on making sure that the chain and other things were taut enough. His jaw was tight as if chewing over what I'd said. Thinking is pretty difficult if you're not used to it, I guess. Probably got a migraine afterwards. 

When Briar finally revealed what was going on in his head, I got the impression that saying the following words evoked a similar sensation to prying out his own teeth, “It was good of you. Stepping in front of the captain like that.” 

I did a double take. It had been a long day and it wasn't even eight in the morning. Did he just *thank* me? 

Completely dumbfounded and staring like an idiot caught in the headlights, I stammered, “It was good of you to… not let your friends kill my coworkers.”

Seemingly satisfied with the company truck's position, Briar pressed a button to make the obnoxious roaring stop. Meanwhile, I was amazed at what had just transpired, not entirely sure that conversation hadn't been the product of stress and sleep deprivation. On Briar's end, he seemed equally perplexed as he recovered from the incredibly difficult task of being nice. 

Headlights shone through the snow flurry. Victor. Thank *goodness.* 

I nearly jumped out of my skin when the tow truck's passenger side door suddenly slammed shut. Not even a second afterwards, Briar was leaning against the side of the tow truck's cab, sipping a Red Bull. God, I *hate* it when they move like that. 

“Expecting someone?” The Hunter questioned, his typical attitude returning as if the earlier exchange had never happened. “Are you *that* afraid to be alone with me?”

“It's not *my* truck.” I reminded him, having to use immense restraint to refrain from saying something rude. “The boss needed to know sooner rather than later.”

Briar's annoyed expression slowly morphed into a smirk, “*Oh.* The big guy's coming.” 

That made my brows furrow. Why did he say it like that? 

For Vic's sake, I told the Hunter flatly, “I thought you said ‘nothing weird?’”

He rolled his eyes, “Chill. I'm just admiring the view. Don't tell me you haven't noticed. You work with the guy, after all.”

I grimaced, the thought of being intimate with the draugr that I consider an older brother filling me with genuine revulsion. No offense to Vic; he'd have the exact same reaction if someone were to make a similar suggestion to him about me. 

A Reyna line seemed the most fitting way to respond: “Sir, this is a Wendy's.”

As an aside, it truly can't be emphasized enough how much that woman has transformed the way we all speak. Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worst (yes, Wes, I'm talking about *you.*)

While Briar rolled his eyes again, Vic's vehicle slowed to a stop, the gravel crunching under his tires. Gonna have to warn the boss about that later. 

The boss appeared to be just as drained as Briar was, looking even more sickly than usual in the glow of the tow truck's flashing yellow lights. In his haste, he'd neglected his bandana, the wound across his throat making me shudder. It looked like he’s recently tried to sew it shut with some red thread. He'd done an alright job, though some places were definitely tighter than others. 

“You're not hurt, are you?” He asked, scanning the company truck where it sat. 

I told him I wasn't. That didn't seem to help him relax any. 

“It's going to the captain's shop, right?” Briar inquired after another gulp of his energy drink. 

The boss nodded at him, glancing around warily. He got close to whisper to me, “We need to get away from this area.”

I checked the wheat field again. No eyes. No shapes in the snow, either. Maybe the crossroads pests weren't what the boss was concerned about. From the way he kept looking at Briar from the corner of his eye, I could tell whatever was bothering him, he didn't want to discuss with the Hunter present. 

Thankfully, the problem took care of itself.  

“Well,” Briar announced, downing the rest of the Red Bull. “I don't know about you two, but I've got better things to do besides sit here, so I'm going to take this where it needs to go. Call the captain later to see when he can have it done.” 

With that, he hopped back into the driver's seat. Vic and I rushed to his S10 as the tow truck's yellow light began to get further away. The boss didn't waste time getting it started. I noticed he kept checking his rearview mirror. 

Once we were on the road, far enough away from the crossroads that I felt somewhat safer, I asked, “Is there something I should know?”

He revealed that he'd found a deer skull, its empty eye sockets inlaid with the same blue crystals that Gwyn ap Nudd had woven into his hair and antlers on Samhain.   

“I didn't know what it meant, at the time.” He explained. “At first, I’d thought it was a threat, but after some digging, it appears to mean that we've gotten the favor of the White Son of Mist. Probably because of everything that happened on Halloween. That being said, I still don't know what that approval will do for us in the grand scheme of things. Life could get easier, or it could get harder this coming winter.”

For background, the boss is neither religious nor spiritual. Never has been. Dying only seemed to make him more cynical, in that regard. However, after finding that skull, he begrudgingly began researching what offerings were common for practitioners to give to the White Son of Mist. 

That prompted me to question, “So… does Orion have a patron deity right now? Or just you?”

He shrugged resignedly, “Again, I just found the thing. My plan right now is simply to try my best not to invoke any wraths. Maybe one of our… ‘friends’ could fill us in.”

“I have training later today, so I can see if any of them will tell me anything.” I offered.

I figured there was no better time than the present to tell Vic about Briar's reaction towards him. Though, I probably could've been more delicate about it. “Oh, and just so you know, I think Briar is horny for you. Welcome to Huntsman Hell, buddy!”

But where's the fun in being delicate? I can’t be the only one suffering, after all. Misery loves company.

His response to that news was to release a breath that sounded like it came from the depths of his soul as he shook his head.

When we got back to the office to explain what happened, Deirdre shared something valuable with all of us that I believe yinz should know, too: “If any of you ever find yourselves below the Mounds, look for a crossroads. While they can be dangerous, they are one of the only doorways into our world that will permit mortals free passage. The mushrooms and the trees are loyal only to those below the Mounds.”

Good to know. The last thing anyone wants is to end up stuck in *their* world. While it hasn't happened to anyone at Orion yet, the way things have been going, I figure it's only a matter of time. 

To summarize the truck’s condition, its rear axle got messed up. Vic told us he’d be able to pick it up the following day. In the meantime, he would be compensating us for gas for having to use our own vehicles for work. As of now, the truck is back in service, good as new. Say what you will about the mechanic, he knows what he’s doing. 

Before I get into what happened when I asked him about the skull, I have an update about Deirdre, and it's a pretty major one: 

She wants to cut her ties to the river tomorrow. 

We’ve been preparing for it as much as we can. She already has one hagstone on a pendant. Along with that, she had the clever idea to sew a spare one into the hem of an article of clothing that I won't reveal here. This way, it'll be harder for the Hunters and those under their influence to find it. As silly as it sounds, none of us have ever thought to do something like that. It's simple, yet brilliant. 

I know hagstones aren't perfect protection; the Hunt has been more than happy to exploit their weaknesses time and time again, but they're still invaluable. And as of right now, I’m not sure what other protective measures to take. 

“Aren't you scared?” I'd asked her while she was sealing the hagstone into the fabric of her garment. 

Morbidly, I wondered if she could help Victor sew his neck shut. 

“I am,” She admitted, focused on her work. “Believe me, I am. Yet, I still fear being a Weeper forever more than I do death. Is that strange of me?”

Maybe it should've been reassuring that no matter what happens, at least she'll be free, but it wasn't. Even as I write this out, I feel sick when I consider the possibility of losing her. It makes me want to scream. 

Her life hinges on ‘I'll try.’ Jesus fucking Christ. 

I promised her then that no matter what, I'd do my best to protect her. Instantly, Deirdre set her needle down and pulled me close to whisper, “I want you to promise me something else instead, Nessa.”

Interlacing my fingers with hers, I asked her what that was. 

“I know you, Nessa,” Her voice was quiet, yet firm. “Sometimes, you forget to prioritize yourself first. I want you to do that for me.”

She wasn’t wrong. Rather than admitting it, I let out a sigh that matched with how tired I was. I didn’t have to confirm what we both already knew. From the beginning, I knew our relationship would never be simple. However, there was always some naïve part of me that wanted to believe that over time, things would get easier. 

No. I need to stop thinking like this. Like she's on death row awaiting her execution date. 

“I'm still going to do what I can,” I told her, shaking off the momentary feeling of hopelessness that I'd allowed to seep into my thoughts. “But I'll be careful.”

She gently insisted, “If it ever comes down to me or you, choose you.” 

We kissed then. I wonder if when everything is all said and done, she'll regain the ability to feel. I hope so. It doesn't seem fair that I'm the only one who can enjoy physical contact. It feels selfish. 

The other thing I've been doing in regards to Deirdre’s conundrum is monitoring the mechanic's demeanor during our training sessions, trying to get an idea of what could be going through his mind. Seeing how much he’d feel inclined to ‘try.’ In an attempt to encourage him, I've been bringing offerings in the hopes of improving relations between Orion and the Wild Hunt. 

The first time, it was a batch of homemade shortbread cookies. My grandmother's recipe. Along with that, I brought along a bottle of Jameson. As I've said in the past, I'm not much of a drinker, but when I do, it's this. Whiskey and shortbreads pair really well together. 

When I approached the mechanic with the tupperware and liquor, his eyes immediately narrowed, scrutinizing the containers as if he expected them to explode. 

“This is an offering given freely with no expectation of reciprocation.” I told him, doing a decent job of not sounding like I'd rehearsed the words a few times in an effort to get them right. 

“Is it now?” He said with an infuriating smile. “You poison ‘em or some shit?”

Truth be told, I had been expecting this. From what I can tell, it's not common for the Hunters to receive gifts without any strings attached. 

I assured him, “You know I’m not the type to do that. They're regular ol’ shortbread cookies. Just trying to be nice, is all.”

He continued to stare at me as if trying to pry my skull open with his eyes. When that didn't work, he goaded me, “You want somethin’. I *know* you do.”  

Not taking the bait, I shook my head. “Sorry to disappoint. I'm honestly just trying to build some goodwill here.”

“Oh, I getcha.” His smile grew, eyes still slitted in suspicion. “Fine. I'll take ‘em.”

When I handed them off, he inspected one of the cookies. “Don't these usually have salt in ‘em?”

I informed him, “Not this batch. I am well aware of your food sensitivities. On that note, it's also made with unsalted butter.”

A crow descended from one of the skull trees to perch on the mechanic's wrist. Both he and I watched as the bird took a bite out of the shortbread. Its dark head tilted back, swallowing the piece it had taken in the blink of an eye. It looked up to him afterwards, beak open as if gaping at him dumbly. 

Naturally, nothing happened. Satisfied, the mechanic raised his arm, letting the crow fly away with the rest of it. 

“I know you ain't cowardly enough to try it,” Iolo told me before sampling one of the shortbreads, “But mistakes can happen. And it's always possible for a certain someone else to add an ‘extra ingredient' when your back's turned, if ya know what I mean.”

He’d wanted to get a reaction out of me with that last comment. I wouldn't give it to him. But unfortunately, Iolo seemed to be aware that he'd gotten under my skin anyway, judging by the wink and self-satisfied smirk I received.  

Am I that predictable? I must be. 

As far as the rest of that session went, it started with good news: the Houndmaster is back, thank God. She mainly has been taking over training while Iolo's ~~mother~~ medic keeps him restricted to the sidelines. 

She was trying to work with me on parrying attacks. Truth be told, I'm not very good at it yet. Deflecting an opponent is a lot more complicated than other things we've worked on thus far. Requires a lot of timing and precision. And in the midst of all of that, I regularly get the pleasure of hearing the mechanic and Briar bickering over Iolo's healing progress. 

“They're *fine,* Briar. Now, if you wanna keep fondlin' me, ya best buy me a drink first! Makin' me feel cheap!”

The Houndmaster went for a vertical strike, which I skirted around, taking the opportunity to jab towards her dominant arm. She gracefully ducked away before Ratcatcher could touch her. 

“Yes, they *are* fine, for the moment.” Briar spoke as if he were addressing an excitable toddler. “But if you do too much too soon, you'll fuck them up again!”

“I. *Know.* Why you think I'm here and not over there, boy?”

I attempted to deflect another vertical strike like she'd been showing me. The timing wasn't quite right, but at least I managed to block it before getting whacked in the forehead. 

As a result this brought us into close proximity with one another as our blades crossed. It was then that I heard the Houndmaster sigh under her breath, “Like children…”

There was a pause in her colleagues’ back-and-forth. The mechanic's tone was light-hearted as he called her out, “You talkin' shit over there?”

The Houndmaster shoved me back, not looking away from me as she responded evenly, “Always am, sir.”

He chuckled, “I see we're full o’ piss and vinegar today. Fiona borin’ you, Houndmaster? You need a bit more of a challenge?”

It took so much strength not to roll my eyes. 

“She's doing fine.” The Houndmaster replied. “But now that you mention it, I believe a demonstration of what is expected of her would be beneficial.”

*Wait, someone besides me is getting beaten up for once?* 

Iolo didn't move away from where he leaned. The prosthetic wings no longer drooped like plants that hadn't been watered properly. They had also regained their dark red color, as opposed to the wilted brown that they had been since Samhain. Even so, from what I overheard, he still wasn't in any shape to be fighting. 

He nodded, then waved me over, “You're gonna wanna be outta the way for this, Fiona.”

Once I saw her and Briar face off, I was glad he'd pulled me aside. 

While I've never seen myself fight, I imagine that it's not the prettiest picture. Despite becoming more and more comfortable wielding Ratcatcher after each session, I don't have the movements and techniques memorized to the point where they come naturally to me. I imagine that to the Hunters, I must look more like a blindfolded kid swinging at a piñata rather than a swordswoman. 

Meanwhile, their expertise is clear in every move they make. The Houndmaster effortlessly sidestepped each of the vines as if they were moving around her in slow motion. Yet at the same time, she couldn't land a hit on Briar, the thorned Hunter always seeming to be two steps ahead of her. And he didn’t do any taunting bullshit against her like he did with me, most likely because he has more respect for her.  

“They're goin’ slow so you can actually see what's happenin’, so I hope you're payin’ close attention.” The mechanic remarked, that sharp, permanent grin pointed in my direction. 

“I am.” I replied bluntly. 

While I was sidelined with him, it seemed like a decent opportunity to ask about the skull the boss found on his porch. The entire time, I made sure to keep my attention on the duel in front of me. I brought it up as casually as I could.

“Ain’t it obvious?” He somehow was capable of nibbling a shortbread gently with those monstrous teeth. “Y'all impressed the White Son of Mist. You know, in the old days, we used to look for warriors’ souls. The wicked and the weak were just for fun. Nowadays, that's all we get. Ol' blue eyes and your bloodsucker actually gave us somethin’ to work with.”

We'd figured that already, so this confirmation wasn't news. That still didn't answer the burning question we had. 

“So… what now?” I asked apprehensively.  

“Just keep up the good work. Keep treatin’ the Moundfolk the same way you have been. Don't change a single thing.”

Since that gave me absolutely nothing, I decided to ask the real question, “Does the White Son of Mist have something in mind for us?”

“I ain't at liberty to say.” He told me curtly. “Now, pay attention.”

The Houndmaster charged past a tunnel of thorns, then ducked under Briar's wing as he thrusted that hook at her. This left him open. She slashed towards his chest, smacking him right over where his most vital organs would be. If she’d been using a real sword, he wouldn’t be standing. Both of them were breathing hard and tired after the fact.

Through all of her patience, she'd won. 

*They expect me to be able to do all of that?* Maybe in a decade, I’ll have the confidence and techniques down to pure instinct, if I’m lucky to survive that long. The way things have been going, I’ve come to terms with the fact that making it to middle age in this line of work is a luxury. But there is no conceivable way for a human to move like they do, even a well-trained one.

Briar took his loss in stride, offering her a pleasant, “That was fun.” 

In turn, she nodded respectfully to him, “You’re a pain in the ass, as always. And I mean that as a compliment.”

As Briar strode back, I felt something nudge the back of my shoulder. Iolo had given me a light shove with one of his good wings. I wasn’t shy about shooting him a disapproving look. 

“You’ve rested long enough,” He said, ignoring my expression. “Hopefully that was educational for you.”

Back to parrying. With a heavy sigh, I rejoined the Houndmaster, silently hoping that Briar wore her out enough to give me a decent chance of performing better. It did help somewhat. While she wasn't slowed down any, she did seem less tense, so I suppose it evened out.  

That was all a few days back. Still, no light has been shed about the skull situation. I haven’t bothered trying to question Iolo on it any more. He’d made it clear that his lips were sealed. 

While we’re on the subject I think now would be a good time to give yinz a little history lesson on the White Son of Mist. Don’t worry, I’ll keep it brief. This is not just for your benefit; I’m hoping that his past could give me some sort of clue as to what his intentions could be. 

Back before human beings understood what causes the change of seasons, they told themselves stories. There had to be a reason why the world suddenly became much darker and colder, why famine and sickness became more common. The winter months used to be a deadly time for our ancestors. With crops being frozen and animals going into hiding, food was scarce. The weather was harsh. Illness and death were as common in winter as a fresh bed of snow.  

It only seemed reasonable that the god that brought about such trifling conditions would have the propensity to be just as cold as the season he represented. 

The trouble began when Gwyn ap Nudd's lover (and sister, according to some historians, *ugh*), Creiddylad, had fallen in love. Namely, fallen in love with someone who wasn't him. On the night that she was due to be married to the King of Summer, Gwythyr ap Greidawl, Gwyn swooped in and abducted her, stealing her away to Annwn to make her his. 

Naturally, Gwythyr was furious and gathered his warriors to rescue her. However, he and his band weren't a match for the Wild Hunt. And of course, Gwyn couldn't simply win the battle and be done with it. *Oh no.* He also felt the need to hold some of Gwythyr's noblemen hostage, the two most notable prisoners being a father and son. In true Huntsman fashion, Gwyn cut the father's heart out and force-fed it to the son. The boy apparently went mad afterwards. Can only imagine why. 

It was at that point that the infamous King Arthur *finally* decided to intervene. In his infinite wisdom, Arthur told Creiddylad's suitors that the only way to settle this dispute was to do battle every Calan Mai (otherwise known as Beltane, which falls upon May 1st) to compete for her love. An annual war that is to be honored until Judgment Day, when a victor is finally decided. 

In the meantime, their object of desire was to return to her father. Even now, she waits.

Sounds like a ridiculous arrangement to me, but what do I know? I'm just a pest control specialist. And since both Gwyn and Gwythyr were at the behest of King Arthur, they were obligated to agree. though I imagine neither of them could’ve been happy about this either. A true ‘nobody wins’ scenario. Brilliant, Arthur. Just brilliant. 

When it comes to this tale, I often wonder about Creiddylad. Didn't anyone stop to think about what she'd wanted? Does she feel trapped in this cycle? Does she dread Judgment Day, or does she look forward to an eventual end to the bloodshed, as well as reunion with one of her suitors? Or maybe she's sick of both of their shit and wants to live alone in a cabin with thirty cats. 

Sorry for the tangent. I've just got *a lot* of thoughts about Creiddylad.  

Anyways, what could this mean for us in the upcoming winter? The White Son of Mist had seemed especially interested in Victor during the Samhain encounter. Enough that he didn't want the boss killed. He must need him for something, but for what? What could a god possibly want with a grouchy draugr? 

Truthfully, I don't know where I'm going with this speculation. All I can say for sure is that I'm worried about the White Son of Mist's motivations towards my boss as well as my company. I'm also concerned about how his involvement may influence the mechanic to be even more of a menace to society than he already is. 

When it comes to Iolo saying he'd ‘try,’ I don't think that has any merit when it comes to the whims of his king. If his leader tells him to do something, he'll have no other choice but to do it. His loyalty and obligations to the Hunt will outweigh anything we’ve discussed. 

If I find anything more about anything I’ve brought up in this post, I’ll let yinz know. I’ll also be sure to tell you all about how Deirdre’s final keening session [goes](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/IhB33kiCdf).
