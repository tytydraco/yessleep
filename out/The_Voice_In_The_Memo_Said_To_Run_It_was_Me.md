The day started out like any other.

I was up early, enjoying a fresh cup of coffee. My wife was asleep upstairs after working a long night shift. It was her day off, so I decided to work from home and let her rest. Not wanting to wake her, I brought my gear downstairs to the basement to set up for my podcast, The Afterthought Lounge.

While prepping, I skimmed through yesterday’s audio logs. That’s when I saw it—an unfamiliar voice memo.

Only two minutes long.

Timestamp? 2:30 AM.
I didn’t remember recording anything at that time. My last saved file ended around 9:30 PM.

Curious, I threw on my headphones and hit play.

Nothing.

Just a full minute of silence.

I figured it was an accidental recording—maybe background noise or mic interference—but something about it itched at the back of my skull. A weird pressure. I hit play again.

That’s when I heard the voice.

My voice.

Faint, glitching under heavy static. I ran it through my editing software—noise reduction, volume boost—and replayed it.

What I heard chilled me:

⸻

“Listen to me. The life you’re living isn’t real.
You don’t have a wife. You never did.
You need to wake up. Before it’s too late—”

(bitter, shaky laugh)
“She’s coming. I don’t even know why I still call it she.
That thing wearing her skin? It’s watching. Learning.
It doesn’t bleed. It doesn’t blink.
But it knows your habits. Your tells. Your guilt.”

(gunshots. a scream. something slams hard—like bone hitting concrete.)

“It lets you feel safe long enough to forget.
You’ve done this before. Don’t you feel it?
The patterns? The same words. The same coffee. The same lie?”

(panic rising)
“You think this is the first time we’ve had this conversation?”
“You don’t remember because it wants you to forget.
It feeds off the forgetting.”

(deeper static. heavy breathing.)

“Whatever you do—don’t go upstairs when it calls your name.
Don’t look at it. Don’t answer. Don’t believe its face.
It’s not real.”

(sobbing now—shaky, desperate)
“Please… just get out. You can still escape.
Don’t let it touch you. Don’t let it speak your name—
It doesn’t kill you.
It keeps you.”

(wet gurgling. dragging sounds. one final voice—yours—screaming through tears:)
“I think I loved it once. Or maybe… it loved wearing her.”

(A sharp snap. Metal bending. Something wet drags away.)

(Then: silence. Sticky. Heavy. As if blood soaked the tape itself.)

⸻

I ripped the headphones off. My heart was pounding. Was it a prank? Some messed-up audio experiment I forgot I ran?

And then—
I heard my name.
From upstairs.

Soft. Familiar. Too familiar.

“Hey…? Where’d you go?”

Then again—closer.

“Babe?”

I stood frozen. My blood felt wrong in my veins.
If that wasn’t my wife… then what the hell was it?

I turned toward the basement window. My hands fumbled with the lock. I had to get out. I was about to open it when—

“There you are, silly. I was wondering where you were.”

She stood at the top of the stairs, smiling sweetly. But her voice—it had no weight. Like it was mimicking something human.

She walked down slowly.

“What are you doing by the window?”

I forced a calm smile.

“Just… getting some air.”

I turned back to the glass.

And that’s when I saw it.

Her reflection.

It wasn’t human.

Distorted. Twisted. A grotesque mockery of her face—like it was learning what people should look like and almost got it right.

Then I felt it.

A hand gripped mine. Cold. Wrong.

“Let’s not do that, okay?”
Her voice was right behind me.

And then—

Everything went dark.

⸻

I woke up this morning.

Coffee. Birds. Quiet.

She’s still asleep upstairs.

And I’m just here, sipping coffee like nothing ever happened.

But something did happen.

I checked my laptop. The voice memo is gone.

But I swear…

I hear faint static in my headphones.

And sometimes, just barely—

I think I hear myself calling.
