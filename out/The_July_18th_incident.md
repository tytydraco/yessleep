Special dead final draft 

July 18th, 2025

Something terrible happened the other day.

Not that you'd know it if you weren’t watching the local morning news.

At first, everything was normal.
A segment about a Shiba Inu that could surf. It was so cute it broke the anchorman’s masculine bravado driving him to tears. A weather girl cracking jokes about an incoming heatwave.

Then—Boom.

It cut to a Breaking News! screen.

A different anchor appeared on screen.
She looked directly into the camera, her professional mask already slipping.
Like she couldn’t believe what she was about to read.

“We interrupt your scheduled broadcast with breaking news out of upstate New York,” she said, voice soft and strained.
“We’ve just received disturbing footage related to what officials are calling an ‘act of unspeakable horror.’”

She paused, visibly shaken.

“The event occurred this morning at the [REDACTED] Avenue School for Autism—a secure educational facility for children with high-support needs. The video you’re about to see has not been edited, but we feel the public has a right to see what happened.”


---

The footage that followed was unlike anything anyone expected. It began shaky, a cell phone being placed down—too bright, too personal.

A young white man, early 30s, stared into the lens with a look between nervous and exhausted. He wore a laminated badge on a blue lanyard. A smile showed he loved working with the kids, even if this population wasn’t always easy to work with.

“Hey guys,” he said, forcing a smile for the camera. “I’m Mr. Judas, and this is our first ‘Day in the Life’ TikTok.” “The Principal wanted us to show the world that kids with autism are regular kids, and they're more than just a locked building full of forgotten kids.
That was literally what he said. God, he’s such a pain.”

He cleared his throat. “So... here we go.”

He looked proud to be at his job, even if his eyes told another story—too many people said he was “doing God’s work,” though they couldn’t handle a single meltdown or bite from these kids.


---

He turned the camera toward a classroom. Small, painted in loud, cheerful colors and decorated with cute things. Posters behind him reminded staff to keep their phones packed away—ironic, considering this was filmed on a phone.

Four children sat around a round table:

A thin Black girl giggling as a tall white male aide tickled her arms.

A Pakistani boy clinging tightly to an older woman’s waist, face buried in her stomach.

A tiny Hispanic girl, her hands darting across an iPad screen, giggling at images only she could see.

A chubby Hispanic boy beside her, silent and locked into his own screen.


He pointed at the kids:

“That’s Leighton, she’s our little track star.” His voice was proud, even if it felt like coded language. Most likely an eloper.  “That’s Ali, our little lover boy.” He laughed as Ali tried to kiss the aide’s arm. “This is Valeria, scientists actually believe she’s where giggles originate from,” he joked. Valeria giggled in response. "And this is Angel. He’s a new transfer, but he’s great so far.”

“Say hi, guys!”

Valeria tapped a button; a robotic voice replied, “Hi.” She waved and giggled.
Ali didn’t respond, clinging harder to the aide.


---

The camera shifted.

Behind the kids, past the activity boards and felt charts, was a smart board showing “Morning Meeting.” It then shifts to video about feelings played with swirling dots as the kids danced along.

In the background, a walkie-talkie beeped softly, muffled beneath the song. You could just barely hear the words: "Support... room... biting...”


---

Next to the board was a large, wall-length window looking out onto a small, walled-in garden. The pale blue sky shone, the sun oppressed the earth as a bird flew by. But that's when it started.

Instead of kids watering the grass or planting vegetables, three staff members in black padded uniforms restrained a thrashing student. Their feet thrashed as the child tried to grab at the staff. 

The child looked... sick. Skin bluish-grey, especially around the lips. He got more violent as it began to bite the staffs padded arms. The boy's jaw began snapping open and shut violently as he thrashed, teeth gnashing at anyone who got too close.

A female with dark black hair held his arm in a restraining hold, whispering something inaudible through the walls. As they tried to hold them in a supine.  No one spoke about what was happening outside. The teacher just kept filming his work with the kids.


---

The footage glitched briefly—pink and green as it transitioned back to the classroom. The same room, calmer.

Leighton twirled her dreads, mumbling Peppa Pig lines to herself. The teacher knelt beside her with a flashcard book and pencil. “Okay Leighton,” he spoke gently. “Work first, then iPad.” She giggled but ignored him for a moment.
When he sat down next to her, her eyes lit up.

“Okay Leighton, touch nose.” Her slender finger poked his nose as they giggled. “Leighton, you silly goose. Touch your nose.” Out of context, a cute bonding moment.

But they were both unaware of the student outside, devouring the arm of the smaller woman.
Her arm guards couldn’t block whatever fangs were inside the kid.


---

Cut to the news anchor.
Her face blotchy, makeup ruined, full of dread.

“We have no clue if the teacher heard the commotion or noticed, or if he was too focused on his students. I, for one, am horrified.” She sniffled “There is one more video filmed during this incident.” She stammered, terrified to continue.

Another video loaded. The teacher high-fived Leighton when an alarm blared: “This is not an emergency. Please go into lockdown procedures!”

A male voice boomed over the speakers. “Nella, please get Leighton and Ali and bring them to the safety corner.” The teacher stayed calm, walked off camera. A loud lock clicked.

A few seconds later, he returned with Valeria and Angel in his hands.
Their eyes glued to their iPads, they stayed in the corner.

“Okay,” Mr. [REDACTED] said, reaching to turn off the phone. The feed cut.

---

The anchor returned. “If you or a loved one is faint of heart, please leave the room.” She was clearly off script. “This next scene... it’s too much for anyone to handle.” Her voice trembled as the footage resumed.

The camera was off as the teacher went to the kids.

Suddenly—BANG.

A loud slam rattled the tempered glass. The child being held down was banging on the glass. The teacher froze, slowly turned toward the window.

“Nella,” he said calmly, trying to control the classroom.

She nodded and stood closer to Ali and Leighton. He and another aide stayed close to Angel and Valeria. The child banged one last time on the glass, making a small crack.

The anchor’s voice cut through the tension: “It learns.” The boy’s hands banged against the crack, making it bigger.

One staff member lay slumped by a flower bed, arm bent backward unnaturally.
Two others barely moved.

The boy—if it could still be called that—pressed against the glass.

Massive, 5’10”, bloated like he’d eaten too much. His eyes—wide and colorless—ravenous. The teacher grabbed Angel as aides hurried the other kids toward the door.

Then it happened. A hand went through the glass, shattering it like a bomb had gone off. The child flew through headfirst, landing on all fours. His mouth was open wider than humanly possible—red, wet, feral.

The phone fell, cracking the lens, but still recording. The teachers and aides scrambled to protect the students. The news anchor shrieked:

“You can see him! He’s pushing the child through the door!”

“Holy shit!” she screamed, uncensored. “RUN!” The teacher commanded as he tried to close the door but was pushed against it. The boy bit into his arm. "Fuck" he growls as he pushed the boy off and grabbed an iPad to give him something to bite.The robotic “Hi” repeated with every bite. As he approached the teacher again, his grey hands reaching forward to grab the teacher. 

The anchor sat frozen, fear etched into her face. Eyes wide, unblinking, pale in the studio lights. After minutes, she finally spoke:

“What we witnessed was a tragedy.
Our team was unwilling to show the rest of the footage." She shakenly shuttered. "But, bodycam footage from that day leaked on YouTube. It wasn’t cleared by legal or edited. It’s our duty to show it.”

Her voice trembled with fear—the terrifying scene, and the possibility it could happen to anyone.


The screen changed.

First-person view from a bodycam, timestamp July 18th, 2025, 9:35 am.

A gun was visible, a group of officers at a locked door. His gloved hands press a button next to a com system. "Nypd!" The officer shouted. Muffled screams from behind the locked door. 

“It’s locked!” the officer next to him calls out the obvious.  “No time to request entry!” the body cammed officer replied. As the officer next to him prepares his gun. “BREECH IT!” he gives the authority. 

Shots rang out, the door crashed open as the officers give a mighty kick. 


The officers rushed in quickly. Dim halls, empty. No kids laughing. No learning..One officer gagged at the smell of death. A banner with the school’s name stained with blood. As Peppa pig and Minecraft Steves blood covered images greet them on the banner. 

A scream echoed—not human. They turned left quickly following the sound. Their footsteps rushed as they unfortunately found it. The boy, or what he had become. His body even more bloated and more grey. His lips ripped open and k9s on display his face buried into someone. 

Behind him, Angel’s body. His face hidden, hand in his mouth as if hiding a scream. His other arm ripped off. His iPad lay beneath him. The screen cracked and bloody. 


What happened next shocked them to the core. The officers step forward, seeing what the bot was doing. The boy, tall and grey, covered in blood, had buried his head into Leighton’s torso, chomping. Growling like a predator fighting off anyone trying to eat it's meal. 

She lay twitching, breath ragged in unimaginable pain. Every bight from the boy makes Leightons body twitching more. Officers aimed their guns.

Another sound came from the right.

The bodycam swung to show the female support staff—the one who held the boy earlier—now grey like him.

Her black hair dripped red..Her uniform soaked in viscera to cover the union number. She tore apart an aide as she saw Nella’s weakened body.


Nella, once valiant, was dragged into the carnage. A small child’s shoe lay beside her. An officer, hardened by horrors, looked scared. His face stoic but eyes full of dread.

He whispered a prayer. “Jesus,” he muttered as they rushed past the abandoned security desk. Walls once clean with student images were now blood-covered and red. They arrived at the deep scene.


“Freeze!” an officer shouted at the grey boy. No response. The boy bit into Leighton. The officers aimed. The boy looked right again—the camera followed.

The support staff, protectors of children, were now the attackers. The female staff who once restrained him rose, face grey and bloated after eating Nella. Her mouth unhinged, preparing to lunge.


The body fell twitching. The shaking bodycam showed one bright spot—an officer holding Valeria’s hand, rushing her out. Support staff rushed the downed officer. The feed cut out. An apology message from ABC News followed.


No official explanation was ever given. The school remains closed indefinitely.
