I didn’t sign up for this.  

 

When I originally joined the National Guard, I expected to be doing major traffic control or helping out in the aftermath of natural disasters. God knows tornadoes are prominent here. But nothing could have prepared me for anything that had happened. If you are reading this, don't go to St. Grace, Missouri! They have it quarantined for a reason. The only thing curiosity is going to do is get you killed. People go in. They don't come back. You may as well walk into a giant meat grinder; hell, at least it's quicker. The only thing that will solve any of this will be mass extermination, leaving no trace of life. Even eradicating Mother Nature's presence. St. Grace is gone, the businesses left have become a barren lobby of rooms claimed by twisting vines and thorny bushes, and people's homes have been taken and transformed into nests. It's nothing more than a green hell, mouth open, waiting for its next prey to crawl into its city-sized esophagus.  

 

I'm in the National Guard, have been training for about 8 months, and saw no real action until two weeks ago. I was sent to St. Grace, Missouri. Which wasn't a big surprise, as they have sent multiple squads already. It got quarantined about a month after I joined the National Guard, and little to no information has been sent to us or the public. Seems like every time I ever opened up my phone, it's always the same news stories, "This has become a violation of our rights" "The government is becoming terrorists to their own cities" or "Justice for St. Grace." The people even took to protesting outside some of the checkpoints, which made it harder to get through when my squad and I arrived. The protesters were throwing anything they had at the vehicle; one guy even went up to the passenger side door and tried to break the window with a jagged piece of cement he grabbed from the side of the road.  

 

"That rock's not doing shit, buddy!"  

 Sergeant chuckled, the first sound he made all day. Despite his generally stoic demeanor. "Might as well be using a wet noodle on a tank," he added with that half-smile that rarely broke through his stony expression.  

 

After the crowd inevitably divided to make room for us, we stopped at the front gates. My sergeant gave the guard at the gate some identification and an envelope. Two other guys from my squad, Lucas and Caden, were still snacking on rolls we got from breakfast and snickering at each other, watching the protesters. Lucas spoke through a mouthful of bread.  

 

"It's been months by now, you would think they would start to understand that this protesting shit isn't going to do anything."  

Caden, his partner-in-crime with that perpetual smirk of his, nudged Lucas with his elbow. "Probably some dumb flat earthers looking for something new. I swear every conspiracy has the same five people in it, just with different tinfoil hats."  

"Next week they'll be saying the government's turning birds into spies," Lucas snorted, crumbs spraying from his mouth.  

 

"Jesus, close your mouth when you chew," I groaned, brushing bread bits off my uniform.  

 

"And to be fair, people had to evacuate from their homes with no explanation. I would be pissed off too."  

 

Lucas put on his stupid grin, swallowing down his food. “We might have to give you a tinfoil hat.”  

 

The guards gave my Sergeant his ID and opened the doors. It was about then I realized how well they've been quarantining this area. The road went straight and looked abandoned like it was a wasteland, nothing was around it besides some abandoned cars left on the side of the road, most accompanied by only 2 tires and shattered windshields.  

 

"We're going to head to the checkpoint at the hotel off of Highway 63." Carly was holding a map out on her lap as she was helping our Sergeant navigate. Her usually perfect posture is momentarily relaxed as she traced routes with her fingertip. Still puzzles me why we have to use a map and not our phones with Google Maps. It's not like we're in some foreign country where reception is as hard to come by as diamonds.  

 

"Why can't we just use GPS?" I asked, leaning forward between the seats.  

 

Carly's eyes didn't leave the map. "Because it’s more reliable" she replied, that authoritative tone making me sink back into my seat. Then, almost under her breath, "Not everything needs to be solved by technology, Nick."  

 

The smell of the lush trees filled my nostrils through the open car door window. However, the closer we got to the hotel, the rougher the roads started to get. I know the roads haven't had people repair them in months, but also no one has driven on these roads besides the occasional squad car. I wouldn't think the roads would be this rough already. Looking outside the window, you could see vines growing on some of the buildings, and trees in the middle of parking lots that grew from under them. I was in awe, stunned by how beautiful it looked, almost poetic watching nature take over and claim the abandoned homes and cars only able to be made by man, but also confused about how nature could grow over so quickly.  

 

"How many people do you think are still living here?"  

 

Our Sergeant looked at me from the rear-view mirror with the old serious demeanor he always has, the deep creases between his eyebrows becoming more pronounced. Man can't make a smile unless he's laughing at his own jokes.  

"I'm not sure, kid," he said, his eyes flicking back to the road. "They spotted a few people in the middle of town though, couldn't tell if they were old residents or protesters." He tightened his grip on the steering wheel. "My guess is they’re just some dumb kids who got in somehow."  

 

When we arrived at the hotel, I was surprised, to say the least. Didn't look like Mother Nature had claimed it much at all, probably due to other squads coming in and using this place as well and maintaining it. I and the two other guys started to grab our bags and equipment from the back seats.  

 

"Let's go, idiots," Carly said out of retaliation for us taking more than half a second to get out of the car, reminding me of my little brothers when they started to get annoyed at me. I could hear Lucas mumble something under his breath.  

 

"Bitch."  

 

"What the hell did you say?" Carly screamed, her face flushing red, filled with anger. Sarg couldn't help but chuckle to himself as he walked to the main doors.  

"I said of course," Lucas said sarcastically with a smile that annoyed even me. He has one of those shit-eating grins that either could make someone instantly like him or hate him, with those dimples that he swore made him irresistible.  

 

"Sure you did, pretty boy," Carly snapped, shouldering her pack.   

  

“I like to think I'm a very pretty boy.” I could feel the cringe physically hurt me from his reply.  

  

Walking out of the car, I could see that the squads before even chopped down some of the trees that were in the parking lot. There was a tree growing out of the base of the statue a few meters in front of the main entrance that they cut down halfway. Walking up to it, the cut of the trunk looked rough, and I could see other marks further down the trunk from attempts of trying to cut it down as it took them all their might to finally trim the damn thing.  

 

"You got the radio right Nick?" Carly screamed from the car.  

 

"Yeah, I got it and the receiver thing," I yelled back, holding up the box.  

 

"Don't lose it like you lost your dignity when you cried watching 'Marley and Me,'" Lucas called out, making Caden burst into laughter.  

 

"That was ONE time!" I protested. "And you cried too, you just wouldn't admit it."  

"Did not."  

"Your pillow was soaked, man." Lucas shook his head as he went inside the hotel.  

I went to head inside myself but I noticed something that stopped me, the trunk of the tree had no rings. The trunk was not small either, about a foot and a half in diameter. I don't think a single tree in the entire world, synthetic or otherwise, could grow that thick in such a small time frame. Theories swarmed my mind but I went inside the hotel before Carly yelled at me. The interior was nothing fancy, it was clear they were going for a hunting lodge feel. Wood carvings of bears and birds were decorated all over the place, and the walls with a clean dark green finish. I set the radio and the receiver on the reception desk and dropped my bag on a couch in the back of the room claiming the seat. For the next hour, I watched Lucas and Caden try to connect the radio and get it to work, getting upset at each other when one of them did something wrong.  

 

"That's a YELLOW cable! Why would it go into the socket that is red?" Lucas shouted,  He rapped his knuckles against Caden's forehead. "Hello? Anyone home? Did you not learn your colors in kindergarten?!"  

"Well I don't know, maybe it's because there is no socket that's fucking yellow!" Caden fired back, running his hand through his perpetually messy hair in frustration. "Maybe if you'd stop barking orders and actually help, we'd have this set up already."  

"I am helping. I'm helping by not letting you fry our only means of communication," Lucas muttered, shoving Caden aside. "Just let me do it. Go be useful somewhere else."  

"Why don't you both shut up and read the manual?" I suggested, earning glares from both of them.  

Carly set her stuff on the couch next to the one I was lying on and took a seat, releasing a long sigh after the long trip we had taken. Did not help that me and the other guys wouldn't stop talking the whole way.  

"How are you doing Nick?" I was shocked by her real attempt to start a conversation; to be honest I thought small talk was one of her biggest pet peeves.  

"Fine, but something about this place seems so off." She gave a small smile, a rare crack in her usually stern facade.  

"Well that's why we're here, anyways Lucas and Caden are going to be looking out for tonight so make sure you sleep well." I grabbed a Fanta I got from one of the soda machines which was probably expired. "Are you sure the two protecting us for the night is a good idea? I mean they can't even stay serious at training."  

 the more she seemed like she was having a good time.  

 

"Well, it's either volunteer to do so and feel like shit tomorrow, or get some actual good sleep at the cost of two idiots being the wall that protects me from life and death. I choose sleep." She shrugged, stretching her legs out. "Besides, they might be idiots, but they're the best idiots we got. I've seen Lucas take down guys twice his size in training."  

Lucas and Caden started to drag a mattress from one of the rooms bringing them to the lobby and laid a blanket on it. They also brought energy drinks and chips scattered them around the mattress and sat the radio in the middle. Lookedlike the setup my brothers would have when they wanted to stay up all night in the living room and play Call of Duty Zombies.  

 

"It's like a middle school sleepover," I said, laughing at my own joke. "All you guys need is a onesie and some ghost stories."  

 

"Actually," Lucas called from across the room, "we're setting up a strategic monitoring point while maintaining essential communications. Isn't that right, Caden?"  

 

"Absolutely," Caden nodded seriously. "Very official military business happening here." He cracked open an energy drink and took a long swig. "Also, we were thinking of braiding each other's hair later." I laughed, sinking deeper into the couch. For how annoying they could be, they’ve been one of the few people able to make me laugh for the last few months.  

I started thinking about my brothers though. I wonder if they're okay right now. Before I went to go on this mission, I left my oldest brother Cooper in charge and told him if anything was broken it was his ass on the line. I know he's responsible but he is still just 15, and I remember how I was back then. Usually play games with my friends online while being high on weed and eating Hot Pockets at 3 in the morning. My oldest brother isn't anything like I was, however, I've seen him almost burn our house down from microwaving macaroni and cheese in a cup and forgetting to put water in it. I remember the scent of burnt nail polish surrounding every crevasse and molding itself into the home for weeks.  

 

My youngest brother, Malachi, is more reserved. I’m worried about him because he doesn’t talk to many other peoplebesides me and occasionally Cooper. When he does talk to me, it’s usually people’s stories he would read on here. He would tell me scary stories inspired by the posts he would see. I used to joke to myself when I would watch him start making up details because parts of the story vanished from his mind. Now, glancing at some of these, I'm not sure if these are just stories. I wonder if he knew.  

  

When I woke up, Lucas was lingering over me. Holding freshly brewed coffee and extremely sleep-deprived. His normally bright eyes were bloodshot and half-closed. "Wake up." His voice was deep and crackly, straining to make any noise.  

"Jesus, you look like death," I muttered, sitting up and taking the coffee. "Anything happened last night?"  

 

"Nothing," he yawned, stretching his arms over his head. "Well, I thought I saw something moving in the trees around 3 AM, but it was probably just my brain melting from boredom."  

Breakfast consisted of mediocre biscuits and 2 small lines of bacon. The coffee tasted like dirt and the scent was an assault to the nostrils. It was going to be about an hour until the sun rose, and the sky was filled in with a very dark blue, still displaying all the stars. Sarg started grabbing his stuff, methodically checking his gear with practiced precision.  

 

"Alright shitheads, let's get going into town before the sun comes up." He slammed a magazine into his pistol with a sharp click. "And for God's sake, try not to wander off when  

we get there like you do in training, Caden."  

 

"That was literally ONE time," Caden protested, slinging his pack over his shoulder. "And I was just following what I thought was a shortcut."  

 

"That led you to your bed." Lucas snickered.  

 

"Purely coincidental," Caden insisted, his ears turning red while pouring coffee into his thermos.  

 

I walked out of the hotel heading towards the car, rubbing my eyes. I wish I had taken advantage of the extra coffee. On the way to the car, I noticed something. The trunk, coming out of the statue. It’s scars from the last squad that tried to cut it down, it looked like healed wounds. The wood-filled in the chunks, but the bark still hadn't covered it. The splinters that came from the top of the trunk were now a smooth surface like the cut of the tree was with one clean swing. This must be why they quarantined the area. If nature could grow like this in town, maybe it could weaken the foundations of buildings and become a hazard, but then why keep it such a secret?  

 

We continued on the highway for a few minutes, but the number of cars that were on the side of the road was alarming, all of them ruined and covered in warping paint and rust. Ivy and vines claimed the bridges, replacing the concrete of its pillars. Birds and deer were wandering the deserted land and would watch us as we drove by like we were imposters coming into their territory. After a few minutes of driving on the highway, heading to town. We stopped at a 4-story parking garage. Walking out of the car the air felt heavy and moist, clinging to my skin like an invisible film.  

 

Lucas and Caden went up to the garage with a drone they got from the trunk to see if they could spot anyone. They raced each other all the way up the garage like we were in a track field, Caden's competitive spirit driving him forward despite his shorter legs.  

 

"Last one up gets to fly it first!" Lucas called, already two steps ahead.  

 

"I don't fucking think so!" Caden shouted back, huffing as he tried to keep pace.  

 

Apparently, the coffee and energy drinks were still lingering in their system and acting like they didn't just pull off an all-nighter. The sergeant directed me and Carly to go down the road and scout the area and see what we could find. The air between us was filled with an awkward silence. I met Carly about 2 or 3 weeks into my training, and she was just as quiet and serious back then. I'm pretty sure she was drinking the night before, she looked tired and drained, her usually perfect ponytail coming loose with strands falling around her face. We entered an alley that looked like a path to the back door of an old bakery. The place reeked of rot when we entered. Moldy loaves of bread and cakes still filled the storage rooms and the open displays in the front of the bakery. Carly couldn't even go inside without feeling like she was going to vomit. The windows were all barricaded and all the doors were locked. I yelled from inside "Do you think some of those protesters camped in here?"  

 

All I heard in response was the sound of gagging drifting away, distancing from the mold-infused bakery. Sorry for the details but if I had to suffer that disgusting place and a nauseous Carly, so do you.  

 

A lot of the decorations were still intact. I could tell the owners were trying to go for a mother's kitchen kind of feel. The bottom of the walls were laid with brick and it had a white paint finish above it. Metal empty lanterns hung from the ceiling, with candles still inside. The sign with the prices was a chalkboard, however now it's all cracked or broken and one of the boards fell to the floor. I could imagine how cozy this place was, buying a croissant and a small cappuccino and looking out the glass window. St. Grace was a college town so every business's income was from students primarily. I only had a year of college life before I joined the National Guard. I told myself I joined because when I served my years, my college would be paid for by the government. However, in all honesty, I think I'm just plagued with uncertainty. Within a year I changed my major three times. I originally went with a Political Science major, but that changed within the first few weeks. Then it was a Business major because my father told me it was the only one that mattered. But within a few months after that, I rebelled against my father's suggestion and went for an English major.  

 

"Business major? Really?" my father had said when I told him I'd switched from Political Science. "That's the only degree worth a damn these days."  

 

"Yes, Dad," I'd replied, the words tasting like cardboard. "I know." Three months later I'd called him again.  

 

"English?" he'd exploded. "What the hell are you going to do with an English degree except ask people if they want fries with that?"  

 

"Maybe I'll write the great American novel," I'd said, knowing it would get under his skin.  

The silence had stretched for so long that I thought he'd hung up.  

 

"Your mother would be disappointed," he'd finally said, his voice low and cutting.  

 

"Low blow, Dad," I'd whispered, ending the call.  

 

Sadly I didn’t enjoy any of those majors, definitely hated studying business. But growing up we were extremely poorand I didn't want to start a family with no money however I haven't dated someone since my freshman year of high school and that was just a date so I don't even know why I'm thinking about starting a family. I didn't and still don't know what I want to do with my life. I hope whatever it is...It makes me a lot of money so I can finally be happy.  

 

I went through the entire bakery, cabinets, and all and the only thing that stood out were some soup cans that were deserted by their owner. Unopened but expired about 5 months ago. Looking up from behind the counter, I saw something outside the main windows of the bakery. The window was only barricaded by 3 wooden boards. So I was still able to see a deer in the middle of the road. It was looking right at me, its head unnaturally still. I thought it was adorable until after a few seconds of it still staring at me, I started feeling a heavy weight of unease. I started to wonder how long it's been watching me. It started slowly raising its head, keeping its lifeless eyes locked on me—dark, glassy orbs that reflected no light. It didn't even look real like someone replaced the insides for a robot. It moved so slowly and never looked away like a security camera. Creeped out, I finally walked away. I could already feel the headache coming in from all the mold.  

 

When I walked out of the place, I found Carly sitting on the curb, supporting her drooping head with her hands looking at the ground. "Do you need some water? I didn't eat all my breakfast if you want it?" Carly looked up at me, looking worse than before.  

 

"Uhm, I'll have some water if you got it." Her voice was raspy like each word scraped her throat on the way out. "God, I feel like I've been hit by a truck."  

 

I gave her my canteen and she grabbed Ibuprofen from her bag and took it with some of the water. I sat my bag down next to her and took a seat on the short curb, forcing my legs to either lay outward or raise my knees up towards my chin.  

 

"Nothing was in there besides some soup cans, no sign of anyone being in there recently."  

She didn't reply but just kept staring down the street, chewing absently at her bottom lip like she was deep in thought. I didn't want to mention the deer because, well it's a deer in Missouri, it's nothing special in the grand scheme of things and I thought I was just being paranoid.   

 

"Did you sleep well?"  

 

She just sighed, the dark circles under her eyes answering my question.  

"Like a baby," she muttered sarcastically. "If that baby had night terrors and insomnia." She massaged her temples. "Had the weirdest dreams. Kept seeing things moving in the trees, watching me. Took me hours to fall asleep."  

We sat there in silence for a while, I started to realize how quiet it was. You couldn't hear a single bird chirp. There was little to no wind, and not even a croak of a frog or a distant squirrel on a telephone pole. The silence was suddenly broken by the speeding sound of the drone zooming right above us taking a sharp turn to go down another alleyway. I looked back at Carly,   

 

"Just uhh...let me know if you need anything okay?" Carly nodded, reaching out to hand back the water but I rejected it, telling her to keep it.  

 

"Thanks, Nick," she said softly, a rare moment of vulnerability peeking through her tough facade. "You're a good kid."  

 

"I'm twenty-two," I protested with a small smile.  

 

"And I’m twenty-four, Like I said," she replied, her lips curving up slightly. "A kid."  

For the next few hours, we would break into homes and small stores, not a single sign of life besides the occasional food can and dead critter. Carly kept having to take a seat at every other place we searched. My walkie started going off.  

 

"Lucas and Caden didn't find anything, but they're going to camp out in the garage to continue searching."  

 

It was Sarg back in the car. Me and Carly started retracing our steps back to the garage. She looked better than she was earlier that morning, she threw up about 2-3 times however and it was just as sickening as the mold in the bakery. I have a very weak stomach so I try not to think too hard about it. When we got to the car, we left 2 meal packs for Lucas and Caden, warned them to not be stupid, and started to head back to the hotel. Sarg was going through different stations on the radio and stopped on some station that only played songs from the 70's-90's. I couldn't recognize any of the music, but Sarg made sure I knew the exact song and the history behind it, his usually gruff voice softening with nostalgia.  

"Now this," he said, tapping his fingers against the steering wheel, "this is real music. Not that auto-tuned garbage you kids listen to these days."  

 

"Let me guess," I said, leaning forward. "You walked uphill both ways to school too?"  

To my surprise, he laughed—a genuine, throaty chuckle that seemed to surprise even him.  

 

"You bet your ass I did. Barefoot, in the snow."  

 

That entire car ride is the most I have ever heard the man talk, going on about the history behind the song "One Toke Over the Line" and how the duo who made it got on Richard Nixon's enemy list. Must have been one crazy life back then.  

When we got back to the hotel I hopped on the radio and reached out to the chaotic duo. "Lucas and Caden you there?" Took a few seconds for them to respond.  

 

"Yup, we just got done heating up our dinner and flying the drone around, and still haven't seen anything," I responded in a more sarcastic tone.  

 

"You're aware that thing isn't made to play around with and do dumb tricks right?" I replied.  

 

"Are you aware that this is the only time I can fly a 20,000-dollar drone without some dipshit getting mad if I fly it more than 1 mile per hour?" Lucas replied, that rebellious streak of his coming through. He wasn't entirely wrong, but if he crashes that drone it's 20,000 dollars he probably has to make up for.  

 

"Just don't be too stupid," I said, sounding like a father who knows when his kids are most definitely going to do something dumb.  

 

"Yes, Mom," Lucas drawled. "We promise to be in bed by nine and brush our teeth."  

 

"I'll even floss," Caden added. I could practically hear his grin through the radio.  

 

"I will say we've only been finding wildlife, raccoons and deer mostly. But even if they keep going back to the tree lines, I guess they don't even like being here."  

They laughed, but when they said that I could not help but be overwhelmed with the feeling that I was being watched. Theories about what could be wrong with this place plagued and dwelled deep in my thoughts. I could see how nature could become a big hazard, but doesn't explain some of these buildings that are all boarded up. The people that sneak in here through those fences never get seen again, the fact that we were sent to find stragglers but we didn't find a single piece of evidence of someone being here recently. When they informed me about the mission before I left, they used those exact words, "Stragglers." What do they mean by stragglers, if they're referring to people before the quarantine why weren't they evacuated before? How could anyone be alive after 8 months in this place?  

 

Carly came over with a Red Bull from one of the vending machines, setting it on the desk. "Do you think you could be on watch tonight?"  

 

I grabbed the drink and nodded. She stood there, looking guilty. "I'm sorry I had to keep sitting out today, I think I was having a migraine or something." She was looking better than earlier that day, some color returning to her pale cheeks from earlier. I replied saying   

"It's fine, I was just glad you didn't die of dehydration or get too annoyed by me." She smiled and walked away, leaving the canteen I gave her on my couch before she went to hers and fell asleep. Sarg took the mattress that was left on the floor from the night before.  

Lucas and Caden only talked a few times throughout the night on the radio, always saying they spotted some animal or an interesting location that we should check out the next day, but still but no sight of anyone. I could feel the Red Bull draining away but I kept walking around to stay awake, clenching tight to my rifle. Around 1 am, Lucas hopped on the radio.  

 

"Hey, Caden already went to bed, and both the main battery and our backup one is dead. I guess we didn't do a good job keeping them fully charged." His voice crackled through with that hint of sheepishness admitting his mistake.  

 

"It's dead quiet around here anyways. You should just go to bed."  

 

Right then I noticed something outside the window towards the back of the lobby. The tree line behind the hotel was about 20 yards away from the window.  

 

"Yeah, I'll go to bed once I'm done packing up the drone and all. I'm guessing we'll be out searching again same time tomorrow."  

 

More but I stopped listening. Out the window, through the back of the lobby, there was an elk just in front of the trees. I couldn't tell how big it was but its antlers seemed way bigger than they should've been—a massive crown of bone, too many points to count, spreading wider. It just kept staring at me and both of us refused to move a single inch. Suddenlythe outline of its antlers was getting even taller, it wasn't just growing, but it was standing up. The creature's front legs elongated, stretching impossibly as it rose on what should have been its hind legs. It must have been at least 10 feet high and I couldn't see its eyes but I knew it was looking right at me, sensing the primal fear radiating from my body.  

 

Suddenly, there was a very loud knocking on the main door of the hotel, frantically trying to enter.  

 

"LET ME THE FUCK IN!!!"  

 

I have no idea who it was but I was startled, to say the least, I dropped the microphone I was using to communicate with the others, and I could hear Lucas screaming through the headset, asking if I was okay in the background but I pointed my rifle right at the door and yelled. "Who are you?"  

 

"JUST LET ME THE FUCK IN, THEY'RE OUT THERE!" The voice was ragged, desperate—almost inhuman in its panic. Knocking even harder on the door.  

Carly by this point was already awake, frantically trying to find her pistol. I looked through the peephole and it definitely wasn't Lucas or Caden, he was wearing a tattered white shirt, and extremely shaggy jeans. I looked at Carly and she was already pointing her pistol at the door, looking at me shaking her head.  

"Don't you dare open that door, Nick," she hissed, her knuckles white around her pistol.   

I could see the window behind her though, no elk in sight. What if that's the “they’re” the man's talking about? My mind is telling me to do anything but open that door, what if that thing from outside gets in and kills us? Questions about whether I was hallucinating or going or going crazy swarmed my mind. What if the thing knocking at the door is what I saw outside? After what was only seconds of a thousand questions going through my mind, it was interrupted by the increasingly rapid knocking on the door.   

 

“Please let me in PLEASEEEE!” I could hear him breathing rapidly, his voice being interrupted by his sobbing.  

 

I couldn’t let that man stay out there, what the hell am I thinking, we’re literally here to help people who are stuck here. I hastily ignored the warnings from Carly and my head and swung open the door. Within seconds the man pushed me down, trying to grab my gun. He kept screaming a bunch of random shit like some crackhead going through withdraws.  

 

"FEAST! YOU'RE ONE OF THEM!"  

 

"Get OFF him!" Carly screamed, her pistol shaking in her hands. "I will shoot you!"  

I could feel him slamming his fists against my chest. His left hand was wrapped around my neck, pressing it against the floor, closing my airway. He looked extremely scrawny, you could see the waves of bone that were his ribs. He started to laugh as he slammed his head against my forehead. I didn't even realize that my gun was now on the floor away from me. My only mission was to get him down on the ground so we could at least restrain him. Carly stood there with her gun pointing at him, screaming to get off me. I doubt he even registered what she was saying, he kept mumbling to himself.  

 

"Dry bones to the moist Leafs."   

 

"I won't I won't I won't."   

 

"IT'LL KILL US ALL."  

 

His eyes were wild, and bloodshot, darting frantically around the room like he was seeing things we couldn't.  

 

"The trees are watching," he whispered hoarsely while pressing his thumbs against my eyes and kneeing me in the gut. His voice suddenly dropped. "They're hungry. They're always hungry." He would suck on his fingers on his left hand as he would slam his fist on my throat, the whole time he was drooling all over me, like some rabid, hungry, animal finally about to have his first meal in days. He was desperate to kill me.  

 

I was conflicted, wondering if this is a man driven mad or just some crackhead. I did everything I could to get the man off, constantly wrestling with him on the floor. Suddenly, though within a second, I saw Sarg pull on the back of his shirt, tossing him off me, and a gunshot echoed through the hotel. Everything and everyone went quiet. The only noise I could hear was the ringing from Sarg, shooting the man right in the neck, and his thick skull slamming on the hard floor.  

 

When you get shot somewhere like the throat, you don't die instantly, and you don't gasp or scream. The only noise you make is the gargling of your blood clogging up and spewing out of the clean hole in your neck while your lungs collapse. It was like watching a chicken getting its head chopped off. His legs were frantic and squirming around andhis fists kept clenching at his throat and punching the planks of the floor.  

 

I've never seen a man die before. I've never seen someone grasp at anything in their final moments. I've never seen the blood ooze out of someone, dripping to the hardwood floor, streaming down the cracks between the planks. Slowly combining into a puddle of a deep red. His eyes eternally were facing the frame of the doorway. I didn't move an inch, Ididn't   

listen to anything Carly or Sarg said, I didn't even process what I just watched, I couldn't. Sarg grabbed me by the side of my vest, "WHY THE HELL DID YOU OPEN THE DOOR!?"  I watched as Carly laid a blanket over the man's now lifeless corpse.  

"He was just scared," I finally whispered, my voice so distant it might've been coming from someone else.   

 

"Well, now he's dead because you didn’t take the most simple steps to be careful, you’ve been through training, and you did nothing to be couscous. We could’ve died because of your recklessness!" Sarg growled. Carly ran between Me and Sarg to try to defend me. I got on my knees, I could feel the tears coating my eyes, and rolling down my face with no resistance. I tried to not look at him, what was left of him. I could still see the blood spreading toward me, as I looked through the doorway. The dark void filled the night sky, however, I could still see the elk in the night, now on all fours at the end of the parking lot. It slowly started walking back towards the tree line by the road, staring at me, as I was hyperventilating until I inevitably passed out..  

 

I woke up in the cafeteria of the hotel, lying on the bench of one of the long tables. I could feel the strain and dryness in my eyes, like I cried for hours straight. A thick wool blanket was wrapped around me, and a pillow from one of the couches was stiff under my head. Carly sat next to me, laying out a plate and a cup on the table, gesturing for me to sit up. She made bacon and oatmeal. It looked better than our usually shitty food, but I could already tell anything I willeat then was just going to be thrown back up hours later. Carly looked dead tired, but still concerned, that maternal instinct she tried so hard to hide showing through. "How are you doing?" I just looked down, not ignoring her question but just afraid to answer and remember what happened just hours ago. "Sarg went out to pick up the guys...and I made coffee." I quickly replied, "Thank you."  

Any movement I wanted to make felt impossible. Moving my arms up to grab my coffee was like boulders were tied to my wrist. I loosely grabbed the bacon and started taking nibbles at it, having no real appetite but anything to get me to not think about anything would be good for me. She hesitated to say her next sentence. "Have you seen anything like that before...like, someone dying?" Tears start forming in my eyes.  

 

"No...and It could've been prevented. I could have restrained him, hell, Sarg got him off of me. WHY THE HELL DID HE SHOOT HIM?"  

 

Tears were running down the sides of my face. My mind was going a thousand miles an hour, filled with anger and panic. Flashes of the images of last night were now going through my mind.  

 

"I could have fucking handled it! The man probably wasn't lying, there was probably something outside and he was just scared! He wasn't even armed."  

I kept running my hands through my hair and grabbing it tight, tears were now making puddles on my plate drowningthe pieces of bacon.  

 

"What could've been out there Nick?! I think Sarg was just protecting you."  

 

I didn't respond, I just sat there crying. Carly wrapped her arm around me trying to comfort me but I knew she was uncomfortable. About an hour went by, going back and forth crying and asking questions frantically that I knew were impossible to answer. The heat of the coffee was now gone, I could hear the birds outside and it felt like they were taunting me. Sarg, Lucas, and Caden came back and parked behind the back door of the cafeteria. Sarg went straight to the food, filling up his plate and Lucas started walking over to me, laying his hand on my back.   

 

"I heard someone got in a little catfight last night!"   

 

The silence in my response told him everything I was feeling. Lucas started walking towards the lobby down the hall of the cafeteria and embarrassment filled his voice.  

"I'm going to go grab your water okay?"   

 

I nodded as he walked away. I shouldn't have ever joined the National Guard. I've hunted before, mostly killing deer and pheasants. I didn't think about how different it is, seeing the body of a woodland creature, and a lifeless body of a man. Caden followed Lucas's trail, heading to the lobby. Sarg came over with a freshly brewed coffee, the smell of it was strong and made me feel sick. He sounded like a father trying to comfort his son.  

 

"Boy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for doing that right in front of you, and I'm sorry this is hitting you so hard."  

 

He looked up from his coffee and was staring right into my eyes with a stern demeanor.  

"But this is our job and duty, we don't have a choice, Nick. You're a good kid but you got to keep it together." Lucas and Caden came back into the cafeteria out of breath  

 

“Hey, guys? " We all glanced in their direction as both of them simultaneously asked the same question.   

 

"Where's the body?"   

 

The question echoed in my mind, filled with different possibilities. We all followed Lucas and Caden, and once I saw Carly’s shock on her face, I couldn’t even begin to rationalize what happened. All that was there in the lobby was the bloody blanket and the dark red puddle that stained the wood floor.  

 

The corpse was gone—not a single trace remaining except for the blood. No drag marks, no blood prints, or trails. No evidence that He moved at all, and a new type of terror swarmed my mind.  

 

I want to finish the story, or at least what I can for now. But my hotspot from my phone keeps turning off and I don't know when or if it will stop working so I'm uploading what I have right now. If you are reading this, do me a favor and let people know I'm still here. This shit hole hasn't claimed me yet. Cooper, Malachi, if you're reading this I promise I'll be home soon. That is if you guys haven't burned it down lol... I love you two.  

 

* Until I can write more, Nick Ryder.
