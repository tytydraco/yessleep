Hopefully, today marks a new beginning. Currently, I'm a 37 year old white male, suffering from debilitating anxiety and depression. I wasn't always like this. When I was in my twenties, I was so self assured of who I wanted to be. I had a plan. I'd knuckle down at work, move through the company, and start making some serious money. I'd been with my partner, Emma, since our teens and we'd talked extensively about our future. How we both wanted to settle down and make a home together. We were so in love back then. We married in our 20's. I couldn't imagine a life without her by my side. Our course seemed set, and for a while, everything was going according to plan. 

Then I found out, we couldn't have kids. It wasn't an issue with Emma. She was perfectly healthy. It was me. I couldn't have kids. The news destroyed me. I was an only child, the last of my line. I'm not a religious man, I never have been. I don't believe in an afterlife. Children are our way of living on after death. A part of you that gets to carry on through generation after generation. Emma felt the same way. To find out that Emma and I will never have children was devastating. Life had lost meaning for both of us.

Emma was understanding at first. She assured me she'd stick by me, we even talked about adoption. Inevitably, though, it ended up driving a wedge between us. That wedge grew to become an uncrossable chasm. The dream we had of a perfect little white house in the country, where we could grow old together and raise a family, was over. After a few years, she left me for another man. Someone who could actually give her that life. Our life. We got a divorce. I was crushed. 

For years, I spiralled downward. I tried to bury myself in work, but I couldn't stand the long nights alone. I couldnt sleep. I started drinking too much. Far too much. First at the weekends, and then gradually, everyday. I got addicted to painkillers and sleeping tablets. I spent my life in a constant stupor, not being willing or able to stand a single moment of sobriety. I wanted to be numb. 

Soon, I lost sight of the man I was. I started to question every aspect of my life. I came to the conclusion that nothing mattered. I cut myself off from family and friends. Life started to move by me at a frightening pace, whilst I remained still and stagnant.  I didn't care about anything or anyone. I felt separated from the human race. Just an observer, watching from the sidelines as everyone's lives played out in front of me. 

Then, it started. Lying in bed one night, my chest tightened, my hands and feet went numb and I was overcome with the most overwhelming and profound sense of dread. I was convinced I was dying and phoned an ambulance. The doctors at the hospital told me there was nothing physically wrong with me. I had experienced a panic attack. I couldn't believe it. I had felt such intense terror and real physical pain. It was so real. Surely this couldn't just be in my head?

Over the next year, the panic attacks got worse. First they came at night. Then they came whilst I was at work. Then everytime I left the house. My life spiralled out of control. I continued to drink heavily, but eventually, even that couldn't keep them away. My mind began to unravel. I stopped going to work and then I stopped going outside all together. 

To make matters worse, there was a baby that lived in the flat next door. It was constantly crying, all hours of the day and night. I came to believe this infant was mocking me. Somehow, that baby knew I couldnt have children. It knew what thay had cost me, and it was feeding off my pain, gaining sick pleasure from continually torturing me. Then I started hearing the crying even when my neighbours were out. I watched the young parents and the baby leave, their flat was empty, but still the crying persisted, permeating my soul. Why wont it stop? Please, God. Make it stop.


I could no longer tell what was real and what was hallucination. I imagined that my suffering had caught the attention of something truly awful. Not a demon.... That word doesn't encapsulate the utterly maddening scale of this entity. It spoke to me from across the vastness of space and time. An amorphus darkness, travelling the endless expanse, going from world to world, bringing unimaginable despair and dread where ever it went. It fed on suffering, corrupting the minds of the unfortunate souls who were unlucky enough to become it's target. It showed me visions of the Earth in apocalypse. Cities burning, people committing unspeakable acts of violence against each other, fields full of decaying bodies, the streets running red with blood. Over it all was the deafening sound of an infant crying. It was so real. The crying never stopped. I begged and pleaded endlessly, just for one second of peace that never came. I believed that I was in hell. That I must have overdosed on sleeping pills and alcohol, and this was my eternal torment. I desperately needed help. 

Finally, the police knocked down my door. I must have been missing long enough for someone to notice and make a report. I'll never forget the look on the their faces  when they found me. I hadn't realised just what a state I'd let myself get into. I hadn't eaten for days, no, weeks on end. My skin was ghostly pale, and my eyes were bloodshot with massive black rings under them. I had long since given up any kind of personal grooming. My hair and beard were wild, and the clothes I had wore for the last month were stained and filthy. The worse thing was that covered in blood. I had deep cuts on my arms. Dark red blood ran down my forearms and dripped off the tips of my fingers to the floor. 

My walls were filled with incomprehensible letters and sigils, written in blood. My blood. The floor was littered with discarded rotten food, empty whisky bottles, spent pill packets and bloody broken glass. There were holes knocked into the walls. Blood was spattered around them, running down towards the floor. I had constantly banged on them, trying to get the neighbours to make that baby shut up for just a few seconds.

The police called the paramedics and I was taken to hospital. I can barely remember the journey in the ambulance. Panic and dread had completely consumed me, all that was left was an empty husk that still somwhat looked like an actual human being. I have vague memory of asking the paramedics if they could hear the crying too. 

In hospital, at my absolute lowest, weeks went by. Initially, I was under heavy sedation. Everything from those weeks are now a blur, as I faded in and out of consciousness. Finally, the crying stopped. 

As I was judged as being a danger to myself, I was ordered to be kept in for observation.Thats when I met Dr. Riley. She was the psychiatrist assigned to me, and would visit me in hospital for an hour each day. Dr. Riley gave off such a kind and patient aura. 

She started me on antidepressants and beta blockers for the anxiety, but most importantly, she took the time to listen to me. I told her about Emma, about losing the life I dreamed of, and how I felt nothing mattered anymore. She didn't give me advice, she wasn't patronising. She just listened. That was exactly what I needed. I told her about my problems with alcohol and drugs. I even told her all about the awful entity watching me and the baby I kept hearing. Dr. Riley didn't judge me. She kept me talking and everything just naturally spilled out. 

Although I felt able to speak openly to Dr. Riley, I still felt unable to talk with my friends and family. Dr. Riley suggested that, when I'm ready, I should take a break away for a while. A break away from my life. I should go somewhere where I didn't know anyone. Somewhere where I could relax and recover on my own terms, before trying to step back into my life. This sounded absolutely perfect. 

So, a few weeks later, here I am in sunny Mulldoon in the North of Scotland. I've rented an isolated cabin, surrounded by nothing but open fields on one side, and dense forrest on the other. The cabin has everything I need. A fully stocked larder with plenty of food, an old CRT TV with an integrated DVD player, and even a hot tub. Most importantly, it's silent here. It's so peaceful. The nearest town is over 10 miles away. I plan on spending the next two weeks here, collecting my thoughts. There's some great hikes through the woods and the weather is great... well, for Scotland at least.

I want to record my new beginning here, so one day I can look back and see how far I've come. For the first time in a long time, I'm excited about the future.
