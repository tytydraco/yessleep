I am now ninety years old. I've held a secret since 1969 that I've never told anyone, not even my wife. I won't tell my name but I suppose I can tell the story. It won't be believed anyway and what can they do to me now?

I was an astronaut for NASA back in 1969. You won't find my name in the history books though. My name and my mission were never made public. People think that Neil Armstrong was the first man to set foot on the Moon, but he wasn't. I was.

Originally, they had planned on letting the public know about my mission after we had returned successfully, but because of the nature of what happened and the horror of what we found, it was not to be.

Apollo 10 had gone well. They orbited the moon and tested all the equipment. Everything was working fine. Many at mission control were really pushing for a landing attempt. The higher ups refused apparently because they were afraid of having a fatal mishap on live TV.

The horror and embarrassment of such a thing was something that no one talked about. It was the kind of a thing that was always in the back of everyone's mind but no one really brought it up until we were ready to land. Then, all of the sudden everyone realized that we really couldn't take that kind of chance.

You have to understand that things were different in those days. National pride was real and it was strong. People would question the need for spending so much money on something that resulted in a horrific tragedy. Children were watching at home and we couldn't let them see such a thing. It just wouldn't be allowed to happen.

So the plan was to land on the Moon without informing the public until after. That way if something went horribly wrong they would just not tell anyone. This protected the reputation of the United States, protected the public's psychological state, and protected the program from being cancelled due to any public outcry that might ensue in the wake of such a disaster.

We decided to go all out and bring along the first version of the Lunar Roving Vehicle and unlike the later missions all three of us would descend to the surface in the Lander. They pulled back on these two things for subsequent  missions.

We called the Mission Apollo 10.5. Our landing site is classified and I won't disclose it because someone with a high powered telescope who knows where to look might be able to see something that might confirm my story and the government would be twice as upset with me as they certainly already are.

We launched on July 13, 1969, three days prior to the launch of Apollo 11. Apollo 11 was set up to be a rescue mission if necessary. If not, they had planned to delay it while they informed the public and begun preparations for our successful splashdown and imminent media frenzy.

We landed safely on July 15th 1969 at a site somewhat near the Sea of Tranquility on the surface of the moon.

We did pretty much everything that's already been shown from Apollo 11 and some later missions. We were excited and having an absolute blast. It was an ideal mission and just incredible to see the earth in the sky and jump around in lower gravity than we were used to. Everything was wonderful until we got on the Lunar Roving Vehicle, commonly known as the 'Lunar Buggy'.

Two of us took the buggy to explore a nearby crater while the other man stayed at the lander and set up some equipment. We found a cave down in the crater and decided to explore it.

It was large enough to drive the buggy into and so we pulled into it and stopped in the shade. We got out of the vehicle and started to examine the cave, taking pictures and collecting rock samples.

Suddenly from the darkness, something ran up to the other man and knocked him over. It was an olive green color and ran on two feet. It was about four and a half foot tall with a large head. It was not in a pressure suit. I do not claim to understand what biology could allow it to live in that environment without what we call life support systems.

It had an oversize head and large flappy ears. It had large bare feet and large hands that reminded me of a tree frog's hands and feet a little bit. It's eyes were huge and dark red. Darker than brick red.

It's mouth was large and wide with fat lips and when it opened it's mouth, it's teeth were kind of like Hippopotamus teeth. Large, and round, with flat biting surfaces.

It had my comrade on the ground and began to beat him with a football sized rock. I was terrified but I still tried to push it off of him. It smashed through the helmet's glass, sending a rush of air and broken glass in all directions. It was stunned from the explosion of air it had unleashed and paused to check itself for injuries.

I seized upon that moment to get back in the buggy and pulled back out of the cave. As I was starting to drive away, it jumped into the buggy with me and we began to struggle with each other as I frantically headed back towards the Lunar Lander.

At some point the thing pushed me out of the buggy and it continued driving the buggy, following the tracks we'd made on the way to the crater. When I got back to the lander I saw that the Lander had been ransacked and my other crew member was lying there dead in front of it with the flag stuck right through his chest.

The buggy was nowhere in sight but I saw it's tracks going off in a different direction. I climbed inside the Lander and radioed an SOS back to earth.

The damage to the Lander was so extensive it couldn't take off, nor could I remove my pressure suit. I hid in there for almost four days with nothing to eat or drink before Apollo 11 landed and it's crew found me and brought me home.

Subsequent missions had their men all armed with special weapons made for an airless environment. Although I'm not cleared to know, a high ranking NASA official pulled me aside at a conference thirty years later and let me know that they had found the thing before the end of the Apollo program and killed it.

That is all I know and all I'm willing to say on the [subject](https://new.reddit.com/r/DentonQuick/).
