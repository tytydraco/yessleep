The sunlight bleeding through the blinds dragged me out of what little sleep I’d managed to get. Morning again. I stared at the ceiling for a few seconds before forcing myself to sit up. My body wanted more rest, but the world wasn’t gonna wait. Stay still too long, and something out there catches up.

The cabin sat deep in the woods, far from towns, roads, and people. I built it myself after a few years of hunting. Quiet, sturdy, and mine. I’d earned it after my first job for the Department of Nocturnal Affairs. The payout was big enough to disappear, and that’s exactly what I did. Out here, the noise dies before it reaches the trees. No phones. No neighbors. Just me and the wind.

Fifteen years I’ve been doing this. Fifteen years chasing what most people call myths. But I’ve seen too much to think they’re just stories. Monsters, beasts, cryptids , they’re real. They’ve always been real. They’ve just gotten better at hiding. Every once in a while, someone wanders too far off the trail, or camps where they shouldn’t. Then the forest goes quiet, and someone like me gets sent out to figure out why. Back in the fifties, the government finally understood what people like me already knew. They created the Department of Nocturnal Affairs , D.N.A. , to track, study, and kill the things living in the dark.

It didn't take long for them to realize soldiers weren’t built for this kind of fight. So they started recruiting people like me. People who’d already faced something that shouldn’t exist and survived. People who’d lost something along the way. We were broken, and the government figured they could make use of that. Training, conditioning, science , whatever it took to turn us into weapons. When they were done, they let us go. Gave us money, freedom, and one job: keep the monsters quiet, keep the public in the dark.

I never built much of a life outside of work. No girlfriend, not anymore. No pets. Just the woods, the cabin, and the occasional job. It pays well enough, and I sleep fine knowing I’m keeping things balanced.

I grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and stepped onto the porch. The morning air was cold and clean, the trees around the clearing stretching toward the clouds. Peaceful, for once. Then my phone buzzed. A message from D.N.A. telling me to check my email. I made some sausage while it downloaded.

The file was nothing new. Missing people, blood-drained corpses, camps torn apart. Classic vampire signs. I hated vampires. Always have. Something about them just crawled under my skin.

After eating, I went down to the basement. My little arsenal. Walls lined with blades and guns, each one marked for a different kind of kill. Salted steel, copper rounds, silver blades, though the silver sword I’d made was coated in dust untouched for years. Hunting things that hated silver wasn’t for me anymore. Jars of salt and vials of green fluid, all labeled in my handwriting lined the shelves. I wouldn’t need most of it for this job. Vampires are their own breed of problem, and I’ve got tools built just for them.

Vampires aren’t the suave, romantic predators you see in movies. They’re thin, pale, and starving. Skin stretched tight across their bones. Faces twisted, dotted with red-black eyes. Their mouths run almost to the back of their heads, filled with teeth that look more like needles. Two fangs do most of the work. Their saliva carries a virus that rewires blood into something else. Most people survive a single bite, but if the blood’s drained completely, the body starts to die slowly. Hair falls out. Skin goes pale. Then the fangs grow in, and they start craving blood.

They live in packs called covens, hiding in caves. Sunlight kills them instantly. Their skin boils, tumors grow, and they rot from the inside out. Even moonlight burns if they’re young enough. The older ones, the ones with tougher skin, can move under a crescent moon, but not for long. A new moon is their feeding time. The best way to fight them is with light , UV flashlights. Hurts them bad enough to make them back off. And when that doesn’t work, there’s always the shotgun I was strapping to my leg.

\*\*\*  
I jumped off the helicopter as it touched down. The pad was surrounded by pines, forming a natural wall. I thanked the pilot and pulled my bag from the metal floor. Gear is something a hunter always needs, no matter the job. Every creature on this planet, cryptid or not, will attack if it feels threatened. Especially the ones whose fingers double as steak knives.

My hunting gear was built to survive that. Gauntlets that reached up to my elbows, layered with the highest-grade kevlar a government paycheck could buy. The protection ran across my chest and legs, heavy and stiff. Over that, I wore a deep crimson motorcycle jacket. It didn’t add much defense, but I refused to look ridiculous while hunting. The outfit was uncomfortable, but getting your chest opened by a claw and bleeding out in a cave is worse.

On my back, a black backpack carried extra batteries, a spare UV flashlight, my Colt 1911, and a few other surprises. The first flashlight was already in my hand, and a sawed-off double-barrel was strapped to my thigh.

It took half an hour of hiking before I reached the mountainside. The trees were thick, pressed together like walls of green steel. I finally understood why the pilot said I couldn’t parachute in, there wasn’t a single safe place to land. Forcing my way through the bark was a fight, my bulky frame scraping against roots and branches, but eventually, I found the cliff face.

The rock was cracked and bleeding with roots like veins through stone. Twelve feet up was a wound in the mountain, a dark gash that pulsed with empty black. The entrance was painted in dried, rusty stains, claw marks carved deep into the granite. The opening wasn’t wide, five feet across and barely two feet tall. No wonder vampires loved it. No sunlight could reach them here.

My options were limited. Crawling in meant putting myself in a death trap. I glanced at the sky. Midday. They wouldn’t come out now unless they were starving. The storm clouds rolling in wouldn’t blot out enough light to save them.

Great. This was going to hurt.

I pulled my knife and dragged it across my palm. The sting hit fast, but I bit it back and let the blood drip onto the rocks. Human blood wouldn’t lure them out. What I had was stronger. Sweeter. I wrapped my hand and waited.

A sound came from the darkness, stone scraping on bone. A pale, veined hand reached from the void, sizzling as it touched the blood. The thing’s claws dug into the dirt. This one was old, its hide thick enough to stand the sun for a few seconds. Perfect. Killing an elder would terrify the rest.

I slammed the knife into its arm. The cave screamed back. The vampire thrashed, trying to retreat, but my grip was stronger. I drew my shotgun, shoved the barrels into the dark, and pulled the trigger.

The blast echoed through the mountains. Flesh tore. Brain matter splattered against stone. The body went limp, but more screams came from inside. They were coming fast.

I yanked a grenade from my pack just as claws burst from the crack. Pulled the pin, tossed it in. The explosion came before I could move.

Heat ripped across my back. The world spun. I slammed into a tree, bounced, and landed in a nest of branches. My ears rang like sirens, my body numb. If the forest wasn’t damp from a rainy night, the forest would’ve gone up in flames. My grenades were custom jobs, packed with enough hydrogen to make the mountain tremble.

Below, the vampires hissed in agony, their pale bodies burning where sunlight touched them. The cave had collapsed, trapping them under the rubble. I’d drawn them all out. Now they were melting. The entrance was torn wide open, rocks writhing under the weight of dying monsters. When it was over, the only trace of them left was the smoking crater in the cliff and the trees blown to splinters.

My bag was gone, probably crushed under rock or hanging from a pine somewhere. Either way, I needed it to call extraction. I slid down the tree. My gloves took the bark’s bite, and I hit the ground hard. Climbing back to the ruined cave, I found what was left of my satellite phone; nothing but shattered plastic and twisted metal.

I cursed. The blast had scrambled my memory of the landing zone too. I spotted an unexploded grenade nearby and clipped it to my belt.

While I tried to piece together my way back, I noticed a group of burned corpses near the entrance. They were huddled around something, their arms twisted toward it as if they’d tried to pull it free before the cave came down. I brushed them aside and froze.

A woman’s body. Throat cut open, eyes clouded white, skin mottled green with rot. She’d been dead for weeks, maybe months, but her body was still intact. Perfectly preserved.

She hadn’t been turned. Vampires always convert their prey. This one had been killed, then brought here. I flipped her over, searching for ID, and felt my stomach turn. Bite marks tore through her spine. Flesh ripped in jagged patterns like an animal had fed on her.

Vampires don’t eat flesh. They drink blood, clean and simple. Whatever had done this wasn’t them. Something else had been in that cave.

\*\*\*

Hours later, I found a break in the woods, a road. Empty. Down the stretch sat a diner, the kind you’d see on a postcard. I pushed the door open and stepped inside.

It was quiet. A jukebox hummed in the corner, checkered floors gleamed under fluorescent lights. A family sat in a booth, a few loners at the counter. Every eye turned to me.

The waitress came over, maybe mid-twenties, pink plaid dress, hair tied back. “Are you okay, sir?”

I nodded and asked for the bathroom. She showed me the way.

The mirror didn’t lie. I looked like hell. Cuts, grime, torn clothes, blood seeping from my shoulder. I washed what I could, wrapped the wounds, and cleaned my jacket. I didn’t look much better, but at least I didn’t look half-dead.

“Do you guys have a payphone?” I asked when I came out.

She pointed to the back and followed me, probably curious or worried. I realized I had no cash, but she handed me two quarters with a small smile.

The D.N.A. emergency line rang long before a gravelly voice answered. “Hello?”

“This is Jason. Hunter confirmation code K-R double three.”

“You were supposed to be back five hours ago. Where the hell are you?”

“My satellite phone’s gone, and I think I’ve got a concussion. My head’s killing me.”

“Where. Are. You?”

I glanced around. “Some diner off a back road. The sign says ‘Mary’s.’”

Typing filled the line. “Got it. Hold tight. We’re sending a pickup.”

I hung up and stepped outside. The rain was falling hard now, turning the world gray. I scanned the parking lot, waiting for headlights. That’s when I saw it.

The SUV by the diner shifted. A hiss of air escaped from a slashed tire. Then, something moved behind it.

A shape rose above the roof, massive, almost eight feet tall, muscles stacked like armor, skin smooth and pale. It ran low to the ground, using its arms like a gorilla before disappearing back into the storm.

I bolted inside. “Everyone get in the kitchen!” I shouted. The waitress froze, but the fear in my voice got her moving.

I flipped tables, pushing them against the windows. The gray light from outside gave me just enough to see. I ducked behind a counter and pulled out my Colt. My hands shook. A creature that big against my handgun? I was screwed.

I thought it might be a sasquatch, but the lack of fur killed that idea fast. The front doors caught my eye, still unblocked. Dammit. I noticed the out-of-order bathroom, chained shut by steel links. I ran for them, trying to free them for my own use, but the lock didn’t budge. I stared toward the kitchen, making sure nobody was watching, before slipping my finger under the lock. I flexed every muscle in my arm, and the metal popped open. I dragged the chains to the door, wrapping them around it until the steel bent inward.

That’s when I saw it.

The beast stood outside, just beyond the rain and shadow. Watching. Waiting. It knew to stay where I couldn’t see it clearly. It was smart. Too smart.

Then it moved.

A blur around the corner. Claws scraped the glass. The sound froze me. I’d heard that before.

The doors groaned. The glass shattered. The creature forced its way in.

I rolled across the floor and opened fire. Bullets tore through the air. The thing crashed through the doorway, snarling, its gray skin glistening. Veins bulged like cables, and five black eyes burned in the center of its face.

“Holy shit,” I whispered, recognition flooding me.

It was a vampire.

I leapt back as the beast hurled a table at my head. It crashed into the wall behind me, splintering wood and scattering dishes. Before I could react, it was on me. One massive hand clamped around my leg and yanked me off my feet. My skull slammed into the tile with a sound that made my stomach twist. The floor shook as it beat me against it again and again like I was nothing but a toy. Something in my nose popped and blood ran into my mouth, hot and metallic.

I raised the Colt and fired point blank. One of its eyes burst open like a rotten grape. The vampire bellowed, a horrible wet sound that made the air tremble. It flung me like a sack of trash, straight through the diner’s front window. Glass tore through my jacket and I hit the wet pavement outside, the impact knocking the air from my lungs. Something in my ribs cracked. The pain spread across my side in waves.

The monster followed me through the wreckage, crouched low, pacing. It circled me like a wolf waiting for a mistake. My vision blurred from the blood dripping down my face. I spat, blinked, and raised the gun again.

I fired twice, the flashes lighting up the rain. Both rounds hit its skull. The creature jerked, but kept moving. It was faster than anything that size should have been. I backed toward a car, every nerve in my body screaming to run.

Then the clouds began to thin. Sunlight cut through the gray, slicing across the parking lot. The vampire froze, its head tilting toward the sky. Smoke rose from its skin. Hope filled my chest for the first time since this nightmare started.

I thought it was over.

The thing looked back at me, smoke curling from its shoulders. Then it grinned. Its black eyes glistened like oil.

“No,” I whispered.

The smoke faded. The monster stepped forward, unburned. The sunlight did nothing.

A Daywalker.

Stories called them myths. Vampires so ancient that their bodies had adapted to the sun, evolving past death itself. D.N.A told me they didn’t exist. They lied.

The Daywalker moved like lightning. Its claws ripped across my side, tearing through kevlar. I was airborne before I even felt the pain. The car I hit folded under the impact. Metal screamed as I slid off the hood, gasping for air.

The vampire was already on top of me. It grabbed the edge of the car and peeled the metal back like it was tinfoil. Its face hung inches from mine, rows of teeth glistening with spit and blood. I smelled rot, copper, and something ancient. The stench of a freshly opened tomb flooded my nostrils.

It roared and lunged, ready to tear my throat out. I kicked its chin, buying a heartbeat of space. My hand went to my side. The grenade. Still there. My ribs screamed as I moved, but I yanked it free and pulled the pin.

The vampire slammed me back down, its weight crushing my chest. I shoved the grenade toward its open mouth. It snapped down hard, its fangs sinking through flesh and bone. Pain exploded in my arm as I heard the bone snap. I screamed, pushing my good hand against its teeth, forcing its jaw open enough to pull free.

The thing’s eyes widened in sudden realization.

I rolled backward over the car, every muscle burning.

The world went white.

The explosion ripped the vampire apart. A shockwave blasted through the parking lot, rattling the diner and blowing glass into the air like rain. Flames rolled across the concrete, licking at my jacket and arms. I hit the ground and covered my head as debris and gore rained down.

When I finally looked up, the monster was gone. All that remained were two charred legs standing upright, fused to the asphalt. The rest was painted across the street in blackened streaks.

The diner’s windows were eviscerated. Smoke and fire twisted upward, and the rain hissed as it met the flames.

I staggered to my feet. My arm hung limp, blood running down to my fingers. My ribs screamed with every breath. I tasted iron and dust.

People began to pour out of the diner, wide-eyed and trembling. The family from the corner booth stumbled into the rain. The little boy ran toward me, still clutching a toy car.

“Wow, mister! How did you survive that explosion? Do you have superpowers?”

I forced a weak smile. “Something like that, kid.”

He grinned and ran back to his parents. I exhaled, trying not to black out.

A black van screeched into the lot, tires slicing through puddles. Men in black tactical gear poured out, rifles at the ready. They moved fast, shouting commands, corralling civilians away from the wreckage.

From the back of the van stepped a man in a suit, untouched by the chaos. Nathan. D.N.A field liaison. His shoes didn’t even get wet.

He held out a hand. “Jason.”

I looked at my arm and shook my head. “Not today.”

His eyes moved across the wreckage, the crater, the flames, the remains of the Daywalker. “What happened here?”

“Vampire,” I said.

He didn’t look surprised. Just nodded once and motioned toward the van.

“Get in. You look like hell.”

I did as he said, climbing inside and sinking against the wall. The hum of the engine blended with the pounding in my head. My eyelids grew heavy as we pulled away, the flames fading in the distance.

Another day. Another nightmare. Another monster down.

Sleep finally took me before we hit the main road.
