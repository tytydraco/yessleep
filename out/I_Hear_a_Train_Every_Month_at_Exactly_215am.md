I know this sounds mundane at the surface level. I’m sure there are plenty of trains that run late into the night. But every month, on the first, I hear the whistle of a train at exactly 2:15 am. This is specific, too. It’s to the second- I’ve timed it. Again, you may be asking, “So what?” And I would agree with you if I didn’t know my town.

For clarification, I live in a farm town in Idaho- a small island of civilization in a sea of corn, wheat, and barley fields. The roads are lined with family owned businesses, their faded, hand-painted signs hanging by the front doors are a testament to generations of honest work. The people here are old fashioned, but I’ve never met kinder folk. It’s the type of town where everyone knows everyone else.

I moved here a few years ago after I retired. I had been a banker living in Chicago, and the city had become too much for me. I wanted a quieter and more peaceful life now that I didn’t need to worry about a career. And I found that here. The day I moved in, my fridge became so full of cookies, pies, and other foods my new neighbors had made for me that I ran out of space. Well, if I’m being honest, the pastries were mostly the courtesy of the elderly widow who lives in the farmhouse on the edge of town, Ms. Waltz, but everyone was very friendly to me. 

I’ve been truly happy here. I’ve made friends with almost everyone in town, I play pool at the bar on Tuesday nights with whoever happens to be there, and I find the local church community to be incredibly welcoming and honest. 

I would emphasize my previous statement; I’ve made friends with almost everyone in town. It started 5 months ago. I hadn’t been able to sleep, this happens to me from time to time as I’m sure it happens to everyone else. I was tossing and turning from 10pm until 1am, at which point I became frustrated and gave up on the prospect of sleep. It was a Friday night and I’m retired anyway, I would just sleep the next day if I felt tired. I switched on my T.V and flipped to the news station. I like to check in with the outside world from my little corner of paradise sometimes. It gives me a sense of victory, like I escaped all the drama they're talking about. 

Then 2:15am hit. At first, it was quiet. I thought maybe it was the T.V making the noise-a low, but unmistakable whistle. I muted the news, but the sound persisted. In fact, it grew louder. Louder and louder until it was almost deafening, as if a train had run straight through the country without any rails to park itself in my driveway. My dishes rattled, my cupboards shook. Then, nothing. It vanished as quickly as it had begun, without any trace. 

Naturally, I questioned my neighbors about it the next day. Others were just as confused and curious as I was, but no one could place exactly what had happened. There were no tracks of any sort, train or otherwise, and nothing to go off of except that we had all heard something. Eventually, after a few hours, people stopped caring and went on with their lives, me included. I was dead tired from the night before and I slept the day through. 

Life returned to normal after that. People went to work, kids played in the streets, and brightly colored old trucks drove down dusty roads just as they had before. All with one exception. At the end of my neighborhood stood a house. One that I did not recognize- sky blue with a tile roof. It blended in perfectly with the neighborhood and, had I not lived here, I wouldn’t have batted an eye at it. But staring at that house, I had no idea if it had been there before or not, my memory failed to give me an answer. Again, I asked my neighbors about it and their minds were equally as foggy as mine. No one could recall ever seeing that house before, yet they couldn’t remember not seeing it either. 

The man that lived in the house was equally as mysterious. Apparently, he lived by himself. Steve, the man called himself, claimed that he had lived here for the better part of a year. He had moved here from Los Angeles and worked remotely. Just as with his home, none of us could call him a liar. There was this strange uncertainty that filled the air- none of us could remember Steve, but none of us could remember any details to prove his story to be false. 

Accepting the community that it is, we welcomed this man and took him at his word. He’s odd, that Steve. Maybe it’s just how people act in Los Angeles, but he seems a bit off. He talks loudly and with strange tones. Y'know like how a car salesman speaks on a T.V add? Almost like that. He walks like he’s in a military march or a parade- uniform and robotic. But he seems to keep mostly to himself and he isn’t hurting anyone, so who am I to judge him. 

I went on with my days, as did everyone else for the rest of the month, and all was well. Then, when October came, it happened again. This time I was fast asleep, but the whistling shriek that shook my walls woke me. I ran to my window and looked outside. At the very end of my neighborhood I could see a light. It was too far away to see its source and it wasn’t very bright, but I could make out a pale yellow light. Then, just as before, the whistle stopped, and with it the light went out. 

I wasn’t about to go poking my nose in whatever that was, not while it was dark out. The next morning I drove by to take a look. At the end of the road, where the light had been coming from, there stood a cream-white house with a tile roof. My brain revolted against itself. Had it always been there? Yes, surely it had, houses don’t sprout from the ground. But then why do I feel so strange when I look at it? How come, when I talk to Stacy-the woman who lives there- her slow blinks and plastic smile make me feel like I’m speaking to a mannequin? After all, she had baked me that cherry pie when I moved in, hadn’t she?

My mind was in such a mess, I needed clarity. I was sure that whatever was happening was linked to that noise and that light. So, I’ve been tracking it, studying it. Like I mentioned before, it’s very precise. Every month, on the first night of that month at precisely 2:15 am, it starts. Whatever is happening lasts for exactly 5 minutes and 25 seconds. After that, it stops. The location moves too, sometimes nearby, other times I can see and hear it further across town. But without fail, everytime that sound rings out and that yellow light burns, with it comes a new-or old- neighbor that I can’t seem to exactly recall. 

Next, I wanted to solve once and for all the mystery of the strange houses. So, I used every resource I could find out if those houses truly had always been there. First, I simply used old satellite images of my town. But there they were, standing exactly where they now stood- a picture perfect copy of the house. Every detail was exactly the same as in real life, down to the last blade of grass. But that could surely be faked, I figured. So I searched the town library for anything that could show me the history of this place. After hours and hours of digging, I found detailed maps of the town. To my great frustration, there they were, just as they were on the internet; perfect replicas.

The town’s full of them now. I don’t know when or how it happened, but the town I knew is now filled with robotic voices, stiff marches, and manufactured smiles. And yet, when those voices claim I know them, I can’t help but doubt myself. Maybe I have truly known them for a long time. Maybe my mind is starting to go- I’m getting older after all. My neighborhood feels larger, yet I can’t definitively say that it is.

To ease my mind once and for all, I had plans to go look for myself on the first night of this month. I had mustered up the courage to go in person and see what was happening when the sound rings out. I was outside, it was a few seconds away from starting. I was in my car, ready to follow the sound to wherever it called from. Then, nothing. I woke the next morning in my bed with no recollection of what had happened after.

I've become paranoid. I don't trust anyone anymore, least of all my own memory. It's Getting harder and harder to tell who's really telling me the truth. My neighbors tell me no one has ever lived in that old farmhouse. Are they right? Surely they are. But when I look outside, I can't ever recall my neighbors all smiling so much. I never see them without a smile on, not even the kids. 

I'm worried for myself. If my mind is starting to slip, I'll need help. I can't live alone if some sort of mental disease is a risk. At least, that's what everyone keeps telling me. Luckily, my neighbors have offered to help me. A few of them are going to stay with me every now and again, just to make sure I'm okay.

It's funny, I can't seem to remember why I ever doubted them. Now that I think about it, had I ever doubted them?
