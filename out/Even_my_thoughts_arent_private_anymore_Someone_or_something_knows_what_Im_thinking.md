Like many people in this day and age, I’m a pretty big fan of video games. Yesterday, I and 3 of my friends agreed to get on Xbox to play Halo together. I got home from work a bit early thanks to the absence of much traffic, and decided I’d play 1 or 2 warm-up games while waiting for them. Right as the 1st started, I got a text in the group chat informing me they’d be on in 30 minutes. I couldn’t wait. Having just finished high school, I don’t know how much more free time we have to hang out or play video games before we leave for college. 

After putting my phone down and returning to the match, the margin of the score quickly increased to 15, with me having almost all of our ‘kills’ so far. I get a little hotheaded when playing video games, but my parents get mad at me if I rage, so I’ve learned to just mumble to myself or swear in my head. The score was now 32-14, with us trailing. I distinctly remember thinking at that moment, “There’s no way we’re gonna win this game.” That’s when one of my teammates, who was the only other member of my 4 player team to have kills, said “Yup, this game was decided in the first minute.” He said it like he was responding to me (I’m referring to the timing, he didn’t cut off my thought nor was there any gap between when I finished thinking it and he responded.) I didn’t think anything of it, my only thought was “wow, this guy had a mic the whole time? We could’ve been giving callouts to each other.” but at that point, the game was essentially over and I didn’t see any point in turning on my own microphone.

After another 30 seconds, an enemy player killed me, while one of my other random teammates was right there, badly missing and allowing them to escape. At that moment, I said in my head “Jeez this guy is an idiot, please get off Halo.” Then, the same player who had spoken before, once again as if responding to me, said “For real dude, that kid is trash. He needs to go back to Forza” (a racing game for those unaware. it’s common in shooters to insult unskilled players by suggesting they need to play a game of a different genre.) at this point, I put two and two together and remembered how he had ‘responded’ before. At this point I was a little weirded out, for a few reasons. First off, the only time this guy (I don’t remember his exact gamertag, but it had the word “Cloak” in it, so I will refer to him as such for clarity) ever spoke in his microphone so far was the two occasions when he responded to what I said. There was no background noise from his mic or him talking to anybody else. The second reason I was weirded out was because my microphone was for sure off, I double checked as well, and I would know anyways because when you talk in game chat there is a little audio icon next to your name. The third reason this weirded me out is because ‘Cloak’ was on the other side of the map, and therefore could not have seen what happened.

I pretty much dismissed the whole thing because I was so engrossed in the game and trying to get kills. Additionally, even though it was extremely odd, it wouldn’t be an impossible coincidence considering that he sounded like a teenage boy, same as me. So I considered that it was possible he just had a similar vocabulary/mindset on the game. After a couple more minutes, the enemy team was at 48-34, needing only two more kills to win the game. At that point, I mumbled something along the lines of “I’m never playing Halo by myself again, I can’t put up with these crappy teammates.” For a third time, Mr. Cloak responded by saying “Haha, I wouldn’t either after that game. Solo-queuing in Halo is enough to make someone break their controller” At that point I immediately stopped moving my character and an enemy player killed me for the final kill, but I didn’t care at all. 


I checked that my mic was muted, because this time I did mumble it out loud, but sure enough, it was still muted. I checked my audio settings to see if maybe the mic was somehow working despite the button being off, but the “microphone” slider was off too. For those unfamiliar with Xbox, your microphone button and the microphone slider option are separate from each other, with one being your mic settings and the other tied directly to Xbox settings. I honestly freaked out a bit and my mind raced on how this could’ve been possible. 


While I was thinking it over, another game automatically loaded up as is the case if you don’t back out to the lobby. Cloak was back on my team, and this time I clicked on his Xbox profile. His pfp was really creepy, it was this anime character looking possessed with red eyes and smiling with some weird shadowy figure putting its hands on his shoulders. Cloak also only had 200 gamer score, indicating that his account was very new. I returned to the game and Cloak said “Why are you looking at my profile? there’s nothing you need to see.” At that point, I thought in my head “can this dude tell what I’m thinking? Wtf is going on?!” And he responded with “Sure can.” I immediately left the game and turned off my Xbox. 


I called my friends to tell them what happened when they asked why I wasn’t online, and sure enough they thought I was pranking them. I basically pleaded with them to believe me and that there was no way it could’ve been a coincidence. They sort of laughed at me and brushed it off so quickly that it pissed me off. I told them I wasn’t getting on Halo that night and they said fine, their bitmojis leaving the chat screen. 


I closed Snapchat and mumbled to myself along the lines of “what the f**k just happened. Why would I make that up. Why wont they believe me?” When just then I got another notification from the group chat. my friend Tucker, who is one of the friends I was going to play with that night, said “because it sounds like a 12 year old’s nightmare. Now get on Halo.” I typed “WTF” and he said “what?” I pried him for an answer but he kept acting confused. I haven’t slept since then. I’ve been replaying the incident in my head, wondering what happened and if it was all some sort of twisted fate, from getting home early from my crappy job to deciding to play a couple games by myself, which I rarely do for exactly the reason of random teammates always being trash. 


I’m supposed to see my friends, Tucker included, on Thursday to go to an amusement park. I have no idea who I can trust right now or if I’m going crazy. I looked online for similar experiences but have yet to uncover anything.
