As I lay across the only person who showed me unconditional love I try to recap the day once I got to school. Maybe sharing what he did with you all will help me give him justice. I know he wouldn't hurt anyone.

I walk through the halls of my school as I am yelled at by the people who took his side. I thought losing the love of my life was bad enough, but now having to stay silent about his abuse and facing year long harassment due to him being "popular" well I'm done.

"You are an unlovable slut Ash!" some dumb ass freshman yells to me, I shake my head and smile.

"Your brother would say otherwise." I made thrusting movements as the kid spits in my direction. Little does he know about this school, we should be on lockdown by lunch according to this threat that went out. I hope this kid goes first. I sit down in my psych class and automatically notice everyone is watching me. Shit what did I spill on my shirt now? I look down at my black bomber jacket while also making sure there's nothing on my cargo pants either.

"Pst" I'm still looking at my clothes "Dude!" my lab partner loudly whispers "You didn't spill anything, they think that you made the threat. Maybe if you didn't dress like a-"

"Russ shut up, Ashy looks fine plus they are all a bunch of assholes anyways." Justin cuts in, everyone knows he has a thing for me but he is tall, strong, and is protected by most people so they tend to just shut up and listen. "Plus the threat was traced back and the kid got suspended." he pulls out his phone, "See." Our police department instagram shows my Ex's best friend being arrested and pulled out of the school.

"Thank god the prick is gone." I laugh and the bell rings as first period starts. The day goes on like this: hallway harrassment, whispers, Justin defending me. Then the fire alarm goes off, no drill was announced so everyone runs out panicked. The alarm gets louder as white lights flash, people squeezing against me and I feel like i'm going to

*POP* 

I hear people screaming but can't see, I continue to run in the direction of everyone else. My sight comes back for me to see my ex staring at me in fear in that back of my head all I hear is 

*POP POP POP*

I black out, I'm hyperventilating, my hands covered in something sticky and quick to dry, my whole body is trembling as I fall down to the turf on our field.

"ASHY! Please! Come back! It wasn't you!" I hear Justin yell, “just please listen to the cops. I will explain everything to you, Don’t let them hurt you!”

My vision comes back to a cop with a gun pointed at me “Put your hands up Ash we will not ask again!” Why are they aiming at me? There is no gun in sight. I feel like I can't move and once I see my blood drenched clothes.

“I already told you I didn’t do anything!” I yell out once more looking at the lifeless highschoolers and mouthing ‘i love you’ to Justin before I cover my ears and scream hearing the final

*POP POP POP POP POP*

I open my eyes seeing the only thing left is Justin. He is holding a gun covered in the cops blood. He was shot in the chest and I'm just holding pressure repeatedly yelling out for help. I kiss his forehead sobbing. "It wasn't you, I never wanted you to get hurt."

I shake him slightly causing some pain as I cry out "Than who did it! It wasn't you! You couldn't hurt a fly! Justin!" His eyes close as sirens are heard slightly. 

That brings us to now. I'm in the ambulance getting checked out, they say I broke my ankle and collarbone. I was told by my medic I was saved by adrenaline. I should go now, They are being telling me it's time to go. I will update once I find more out.
