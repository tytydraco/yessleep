I’m an independent screenwriter, freelancing most of the time. The entertainment industry barely notices me; nepotism sucks, and we all know it.

I’m primarily a horror and fiction writer, with seven years of relentless writing behind me. Lately, an unavoidable urge to find a job gnawed at me, as if something were pulling me toward finding one.

During my constant search for screenwriting gigs, I stumbled upon a website, "JobsYoucom," and typed “Screenwriting Jobs” into the search bar. As I searched, a gut feeling tried to stop me, like an inner alarm warning of a threat.

My eyes itched, my hands trembled, and a strange hum filled my ears. A foul smell hit my nostrils, bitter on my tongue. But the longing for a job coiled around that gut feeling like a snake, snapping its neck, forcing me to surrender to greed.

To my surprise, only two listings appeared. One was for porn films—I don’t write that stuff. The other was from a Miss Greta, and its description hooked me, as if someone were hacking my senses to convince me to join.

Oddly, the text wasn’t typed out—it was an image, all in red, reading:

*"I’m looking for an experienced screenwriter. I have countless stories to tell. I need someone to carve them for me—if only I hadn’t had the accident that cost me the use of both hands. The stories demand a writer, if not me. If you’re willing to apply, you must know you’ll be required to stay at my place until the project is complete. You’ll need to sign copyright affidavits, too—you can and will be sued if you share the stories without my consent. Rest assured, incentives are on me. Contact details and the exact address will be emailed once your application is received."*

I clicked Apply without hesitation.

*“Hurray, Alexander! You have successfully applied for the job.”*

The pay was solid, and Greta seemed nice enough. There was even a photo of her—rings on every finger of her right hand, slightly undone hair, maybe 45 years old. Behind her hung a painting of herself, penning something down. She clearly loved writing.

I had no other projects, no offers, nothing to cling to. My career was a drowning man, and this opportunity was a lifeline I couldn’t miss.

But I should have.

I’ve somehow regained my senses enough to write this.

Back to the story: I checked my email and found the contact details waiting. Googling the address revealed her house was 98 miles from my town—too far to commute. I’d have to stay there.

After a two-hour drive, I was alone in the middle of nowhere, my dog Bozo my only company. With no signal, I called Greta for directions. She guided me another half hour into the woods, where silence swallowed everything.

Soon, a huge mansion loomed ahead, shrouded by towering trees and a thick haze. Bozo’s relentless barking pounded my ears. The air tasted bittersweet, raw and smoky, with a faint hum vibrating through it. The haze clung to me, wetting my skin, blurring my vision.

I reached the main door, Bozo’s barks still echoing in the stillness. Strange carvings—pens and papers—etched the wood.

When I knocked, the sound roared, deafening.

A tall man opened the door, staring at me with eerie displeasure, his gaze lingering on Bozo.

He welcomed me inside.

The mansion was vast, a massive chandelier dripping with candles lighting the hall. A huge portrait of Greta dominated the space—smiling eerily, pen and notebook in hand. The same one from the website.

A minute later, Greta’s voice cut through the air.

**“DECEIT!!”** she called, descending the stairs, her motionless hands dangling at her sides.

“Sorry?!” I replied, confused and curious.

**“‘Deceiving’ are what our senses can be, can’t they?”** she continued.

Meanwhile, Bozo’s constant barking cut through the silence, the only sound echoing during our pauses.

Woof… woof… woof woof. Bozo’s barking irritated her.

**“Shhhhh,”** Greta hissed, pressing her index finger to her lips.

Bozo instantly sat, silent, as if her command had tamed him.

**“Senses can be delusional,”** she said, her eyes fixed on Bozo. **“One mustn’t rely too much on them.”**

She summoned the tall caretaker to take Bozo away.

I protested—I wanted him with me while I wrote—and Greta warmly agreed.

**“You must be tired, aren’t you?”** she asked, scanning my body up close, head to toe.
**“Perhaps you should take some rest before we begin. Gabriel shall show you the way.”**

“Gabriel?!” I questioned.

**“The caretaker. Perhaps I forgot introducing him earlier,”** Greta responded.

I settled down to take a quick nap.

*Then I saw Greta emerging out of words, perhaps a textbook, and after her followed Gabriel. It was weird; I saw her coming right out of it, formless like a fog. Some words from the textbook trailed her, shaping her form and Gabriel’s alike. I saw a big pen in her hand, and her unsuccessful attempt to write something, the realization of motionless hands hitting her hard the next moment.*

And I woke up, gasping.

Thankfully, the dream didn’t last long, but it left a lasting void in me.

Upon waking, I was frightened to see Gabriel standing right next to my bed, staring at me.

“Miss Greta calls you down,” he said, expressionless, almost like an android.

Moments later, I was summoned by Greta to a nearby room.

It was on the first floor, and the first thing I saw was a big window. The moon shone bright, though covered by dark clouds.

There was a chair and a table placed next to each other, adjacent to a sofa. The table lamp was already lit, its light casting eerily long shadows of Greta.

A big mug-like ink pot and an old-fashioned pen rested on the table, next to a huge empty notebook on which I had to pen down Greta’s stories.

**“Alright,”** said Greta. **“Let’s begin…”**

Just as I sat at the table, an iron-like smell hit my nostrils. Perhaps it came from the old iron nails dug deep into the table to hold it in place.

The pen was Shakespearean in style, old and too big, with a black feather attached to its other end.

The moment I was about to begin, Greta called Bozo…?!

I don’t remember telling her the dog’s name.

And then, Bozo came rushing towards me from nowhere, resulting in some of the ink spilling on my lips. A drop rested on my lower lip, and I unwillingly licked it. It tasted like rusted iron, and the smell was the same.

The ink was bold red and warm—too warm, almost alive.

**“You must begin now.”**

And on I went, penning down page after page, with each turn of the page my desire to flee rising exponentially. Meanwhile, my tongue started to feel a little numb.

**“Alright, it’s dinner time. We shall resume by tomorrow morning. Let’s first have dinner,”** Greta said abruptly, indicating an immediate pause.

Gabriel took me to the dining room. It had a long dining table, its other end consumed by darkness, for the area wasn’t completely lit.

There were writings on the wall. The one facing me read:

"Taste or Hunger, what will you choose?"
"The tongue may lie, but not the stomach."
"Sit tight, you’ve got the appetite."
"Taste is delusional, Hunger is real."

It was awkward to read all those. Meanwhile, I was lost in thoughts and heard a thud at the table that pulled me out of them immediately. Gabriel had brought the dinner. It looked like delicious spaghetti with meatballs.

I took the first bite, and it tasted raw, somewhat like how air would taste. Just tasteless. I panicked—why can’t I taste it? I asked within my mind, and a reply came:

**“Told you, senses can be delusional,”** Greta said while sitting at the table as Gabriel grabbed a spoon and started feeding her.

My sense of taste was gone, and with it, my hope too.

A sweat drop ran down my face, and Greta said,
**“Don’t worry, you have four senses left.”**

And my **nose** **itched.**
