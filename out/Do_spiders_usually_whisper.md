So I’ve always hated spiders. Not just the typical “ew, bugs” kind of hate—I’m talking curl-up-in-a-ball, scream-until-I’m-hoarse arachnophobia. I moved into a new apartment last month, older place, cheap rent, decent space. There were cobwebs in the corners, no big deal. I cleaned. Or I thought I did.

Then came the noises.

At first, I thought it was in the walls. Scratching, tapping, soft but constant. Mostly at night. Like… crawling. I bought earplugs, but I still felt it. Like tiny feet dancing over my skin.

I started waking up with bites. Classic, right? Except these weren't your average spider bites. They were symmetrical. Three little dots in a triangle. Always the same pattern. Always in places I couldn’t see easily—my back, behind my ear, once even inside my thigh.

I went to urgent care. They told me it was probably bed bugs. Except the exterminator said he didn’t find anything. "Cleanest infestation I've ever seen," he joked.

But it’s not funny. Because now the bites are… opening.

Not infected. Not swollen. Opening.

They itch, yeah. But when I scratch, thin black threads come out. Like spider silk. And they don’t stop. I pulled out three inches from my shoulder yesterday before I threw up.

Worst part? I heard something laugh.

I’m not crazy. I recorded it. Or I tried to. When I play it back, it’s just static. But in person, it’s this soft, skittering giggle. Like a child's whisper caught in a web.

And now they’re in the mirror. Not spiders—me. Copies of me. Watching. Smiling. But wrong. Their eyes are too wide. Their mouths... twitch. One of them winked at me this morning while I was brushing my teeth.

I'm not sleeping anymore. Every time I close my eyes, I feel them moving beneath my skin. Like they’re building something.

I don’t know how much longer I can stay awake. I don’t know what happens if I fall asleep. If you’ve read this far—check your skin. Look for the triangle.

If you find it… don’t pull the thread.

They hate being disturbed.

🕷️ PART 2 – UPDATE POST

Title: [UPDATE] I pulled the thread. I shouldn’t have.

> Okay.
First—sorry for vanishing after the first post. I didn’t mean to ghost everyone. I just… I wasn’t alone anymore.
Not really.



So, remember how I said I pulled the silk out of my skin? Yeah, I caved and did it again. Curiosity, right? Human nature. But this time, the thread didn’t come out easy. It fought me. Every inch felt like it was snagged on something deeper.

It wasn’t until I passed out from the pain that I realized—
I wasn't pulling it out.
It was pulling me in.

When I woke up, there were more bites. Not just three dots anymore. Entire geometric patterns. Web-like mandalas curling around my ribs and spine like tattoos made from bruises.

And they were moving.
I swear to god, I watched one curl tighter as I breathed.

Then the hallucinations started—or at least, I hope they’re hallucinations. I saw a woman outside my window, pale skin, long black hair crawling with tiny legs. She didn’t blink. Just stared. And I swear her jaw unhinged and whispered my name.

"Kevin."

I didn’t give that name to anyone.

I tried to cut one of the patterns off. Just slice it with a razor. The second the blade touched skin, I blacked out. I woke up in my bathtub, wrists clean, blade rusted over like it had been submerged for years.

My mirror was covered in silk.

Spelled across it, in delicate weavings:
"DO NOT RESIST THE WEAVING."

I haven’t eaten in days. Not because I’m not hungry—because they feed me. Through the bites. I can feel it. Nutrients, dreams, memories—not all mine. Last night I remembered someone else's childhood. A girl’s laughter. A house I’ve never been in.

I think they're weaving minds together. One bite at a time.

I started seeing them on other people now. Random strangers on the street, necks twitching, scratching at triangle marks. A woman on the bus had silk trailing from her ear and didn’t even notice. Are they pretending? Do they know?

Or are they... hatching?

If you’ve commented or messaged me before, I’m sorry I didn’t answer. I can't trust DMs. Every time I open one, my screen glitches and I see a reflection of myself with eight eyes.

They're spreading.

Thread to thread. Person to person. Post to post.

If you see this—check your last dream.
Was there a web?
A whisper?

If so… it’s already begun.

Don’t pull the thread.

Don’t resist the weaving.
