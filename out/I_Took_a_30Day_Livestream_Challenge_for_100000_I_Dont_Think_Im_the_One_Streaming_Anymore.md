 Day 1: The Beginning

I received an offer from a company called GrinSignal: stream my life 24/7 for 30 days, no breaks longer than 15 minutes, and earn $100,000. The rules were strict: no leaving the apartment, no turning off the stream, and no covering the cameras. Desperate for money, I accepted.

Day 2: Settling In

The equipment arrived: multiple cameras, including ones for the bathroom and kitchen, all connected to a sleek, locked PC tower with no ports. I set everything up and went live. The first day was uneventful, just me going about my daily routine.

Day 3: The Audience Grows

Viewership started to climb. Comments flooded in, some supportive, others curious about the setup. I noticed the cameras had a red light that blinked occasionally, even when I wasn't doing anything noteworthy.

Day 4: Unusual Glitches

The stream began to glitch at odd times. Brief static, distorted audio, and occasional screen flickers. Viewers commented on it, thinking it was part of the show. I dismissed it as technical issues.

Day 5: The Ceiling Camera

I woke up to find a new camera angle on the stream: a view from the ceiling directly above my bed. I hadn't installed a camera there. I searched the ceiling but found nothing. The angle disappeared later that day.

Day 6: Mirror Reflections

The bathroom mirror showed a delayed reflection. I'd move, and the reflection would follow a second later. Sometimes, it didn't move at all. I covered the mirror, but the stream showed it uncovered.

Day 7: Sleep Disturbances

I started having nightmares—vivid, unsettling dreams of being watched. I woke up feeling exhausted, despite sleeping for hours. Viewers noted that I talked in my sleep, saying things I couldn't remember.

Day 8: Messages from Viewers

I received messages from viewers claiming they saw someone else in the apartment during the stream. A shadowy figure in the background, always just out of focus. I reviewed the footage but saw nothing.

Day 9: Time Loss

I began losing track of time. I'd start a task and suddenly find hours had passed. The stream logs showed me sitting motionless, staring at the wall during these periods.

Day 10: Unexplained Sounds

I heard whispers at night, soft voices speaking in an unintelligible language. They seemed to come from the walls. I checked for any sources but found none.

Day 11: Physical Changes

I noticed bruises on my arms and legs that I couldn't explain. Viewers commented on them, speculating about their origin. I had no memory of injuring myself.

Day 12: The Reflection Moves

While brushing my teeth, I saw my reflection smile at me, even though I wasn't smiling. It winked and then returned to mirroring my actions. I left the bathroom in a panic.

Day 13: Messages in the Stream

The stream displayed messages I hadn't typed: "Let us in," "We see you," "Join us." I changed all my passwords, but the messages continued.

Day 14: The Figure Appears

Viewers captured screenshots of a dark figure standing behind me during the stream. I never saw it in person, but the images were clear. It stood still, watching me.

Day 15: Isolation

I tried contacting friends and family, but my phone wouldn't connect. Emails went unanswered. It was as if I had been cut off from the outside world.

Day 16: The Voice

A voice began speaking to me through the headphones, whispering my name, recounting my thoughts before I had them. It knew things about me that I had never shared.

Day 17: The Doppelgänger

I saw myself on the stream, performing actions I wasn't doing—walking around the apartment, staring into the camera. I was sitting still, yet the stream showed me moving.

Day 18: Physical Manifestations

Objects moved on their own. Doors opened and closed without cause. The air grew colder, and I could see my breath despite the thermostat reading a normal temperature.

Day 19: The Mirror Shatters

The bathroom mirror exploded without warning, sending glass in all directions. I stood frozen as the shards rained down. On the floor, they formed letters — jagged, blood-edged slivers spelling out: “HE’S ALMOST DONE.”

I didn’t know who he was. But I was certain they weren’t talking about me.

Day 20: Stream Delay

I noticed a delay in the livestream — not seconds, but minutes. I’d move, and five minutes later, the stream would catch up. But sometimes, the stream showed things I hadn’t done yet — walking into rooms I hadn’t entered, talking to people who weren’t there.

People in the comments said it felt like watching the future.

Day 21: Losing Time

I woke up in the kitchen, standing. My hands were soaked in something dark. I thought it was blood, but it smelled like ink. On the walls, phrases were scribbled again and again in frantic, looping handwriting:

“WHO’S WATCHING WHO?”

“STREAMED ENOUGH YET?”

“THERE IS NO OFFLINE.”

Day 22: No Sleep

I stopped sleeping. Whenever I closed my eyes, I’d see the stream interface in my mind — hearts floating, usernames scrolling, camera feeds overlapping. I could hear the chat even without headphones.

One viewer typed: “We miss the old you.”

Another replied: “Wait for Day 30.”

Day 23: The Feed Splits

The stream glitched and showed two live feeds side-by-side: one of me pacing in real-time… and one where I was lying in bed, eyes open, unmoving. Viewers called it “The Split.” They took sides. Some believed I was still real. Others said I’d been replaced.

I started wondering which version of me I was.

Day 24: Lights Out

Power cut. Everything went pitch black. No electronics worked. But the stream continued. People commented on the darkness. Some said they could see me, even though I was in total blackness.

A new user appeared in the chat with a red name: SYSWATCHER_01. Their only message: “Do not look behind you.”

I looked. There was something tall and bent over the couch. Watching. Breathing.

Day 25: I Am the Stream

I no longer felt the need to eat or drink. The cameras turned toward me on their own, anticipating my movements. I tried covering one — the video showed me smiling as I did it, even though I was crying.

The chat filled with laughter. But not text. Audio. A chorus of distorted voices. My viewers were laughing out loud.

Day 26: Visitors

There was knocking at the door. I ran to it. No one there. Then knocking from the inside of the bedroom closet. I opened it. Nothing.

Then the stream showed someone still inside it, watching me from the dark.

I screamed. The stream captioned it: “He sees you now.”

Day 27: Outside Isn’t Real

I smashed a window and tried to climb out. There was nothing beyond the glass — just static, like a broken TV screen. My hand dissolved at the edge. Not blood. Not bone. Just pixels.

I pulled back and vomited code onto the floor. It blinked and dissolved.

The chat erupted:
“Stay inside the broadcast.”
“Don’t break character.”

Day 28: Rehearsal

I heard myself talking in the other room. Same voice. Same cadence. I walked in and found nothing. But on the feed, I was still in there. Practicing lines.

"They’re almost ready."
"He’s nearly perfect now."

Day 29: System Update

A prompt appeared on the stream overlay: “Update Complete. New Identity Installed.”

I tried ending the stream. The button vanished. I tore the cameras from the walls — they regenerated. One by one.

The chat was full of only one phrase now:

“YOU ARE LIVE FOREVER.”

Day 30: The Final Viewer

Only one viewer remained. The chat was dead silent. I spoke directly to the camera.

“Who are you?”

The reply typed itself out in red:

“I’m the you that got out.”

I stared into the lens. The camera stared back.

And then… I watched as I stood up from the couch and walked away from the screen — toward freedom — while I remained seated, motionless, trapped in the lens.

The stream ended.

For them.

But I’m still here.
Still live.
