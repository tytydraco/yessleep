I led my family outside to our SUV, keeping the shotgun up and scanning both sides of the front door before they followed me out. I saw endless carnage on the street. Multiple cars had crashed into buildings, garages and fences, and my neighbor’s house was now an inferno of fire that sent out billowing black clouds into the air. Further down the street, I heard explosions. They were coming from the direction of the nearby gas station.

I quickly shepherded my wife and daughter to the backseats, slamming the door and running up front to the driver’s seat, laying the shotgun on the passenger seat pointing towards the door. Backing out of the driveway, I nearly ran over my neighbor. She had hobbled out of the backyard of the burning house, waving her arms at me and shrieking something incomprehensible. Putting down the window, I pulled right up next to her.

Mrs. Lukas was a widow who lived alone. Her husband of forty years had been killed the previous year. He always volunteered to help the poor in the inner city, cooking at soup kitchens and trying to connect the homeless with social services as part of his church community outreach program. One night when he was leaving the soup kitchen, some thug had shot him in the chest and stolen his wallet while he bled to death on the sidewalk. Cameras had caught a fuzzy image of the young man, but he was never identified. Mrs. Lukas had never fully recovered from the death of her husband, but my family and I regularly went over to check on her and spend time with her.

“Mrs. Lukas,” I said, putting down my window. She nodded at me, tears brimming in her eyes.

“My house,” she said simply, pointing to the blazing structure fire behind her. “Everything I owned was in there.”

“We need to get out of here, Mrs. Lukas,” I said, pointing to the empty passenger’s seat. My wife and daughter joined in the chorus, saying, “Come on, Mrs. Lukas, come with us.” She wiped the tears out of her eyes, limping slowly around the car and getting into the seat slowly, sighing as she did so. As soon as she slammed the door shut, I pulled off quickly, the tires squealing. I wanted to get as far away from the fires and carnage as I possibly could, if there was anywhere to go.

As I drove down the road, the fire of Mrs. Lukas’ house getting further and further behind us, a massive explosion rocked the street. A small mushroom cloud of black smoke peaked above the houses further ahead.

“Oh God, that was the gas station, wasn’t it?” my wife asked. I looked in the rearview mirror. She was holding my daughter, who looked shell-shocked, staring straight ahead without seeing.

“Yes, I think that was the gas station,” I agreed. I wanted to avoid that area, so I turned left, taking side streets. I knew a few ways out of town through little-traveled forest roads. I didn’t know if the military would be blocking major thoroughfares, and I really didn’t want to find out. I still had hope that they wouldn’t have every small dirt road that wound through fields or forests blocked off, however.

As we drove further away from the houses past tobacco fields that extended for acres on both sides of us, Mrs. Lukas started making strange coughing noises. It sounded like she was choking. I looked over and saw her bent over in her seat. I couldn’t see her face, but she looked like she was in agony, trying to curl up into a fetal position as much as her old body could allow. I pulled the car over quickly, parking in front of a barn.

“Mrs. Lukas?” I said, putting my hand on her shoulder.

“Please,” she said between choking sobs, “water.” I ran out of the car, taking the shotgun with me for good measure, and opened the backdoor. My wife quickly passed me a bottle of water, and I handed it to Mrs. Lukas. She quickly sat up and started chugging the whole thing rapidly. She didn’t look good.

Her face was turning a strange yellow color, like the jaundiced face of a lifelong alcoholic, and her hands were clenched into tight fists. I could see small trickles of blood where her fingernails bit into her palms.

As soon as she finished the water, she sat there, hyperventilating for a moment. I thought she was crying, but then I realized one of her eyes had a trickle of blood running down from it. She turned to look at me, and I saw her pupils were different sizes. One of them was fully dilated, and the other was a tiny pinpoint. I backed away instinctively.

“I’m sorry,” she said, seeming to regain some control over herself, “I don’t know what came over me. It must be all the stress of the day…”

“Mrs. Lukas,” I asked, “you didn’t drink the tap water, did you?” She looked at me sideways.

“Of course I drink the water from my house, young man,” she said, her other eye beginning to bleed now too, “but I filtered it. Don’t you know drinking bottled water is bad for the environment? Too much trash in the landfills and the oceans.” She shook her head slowly and lazily from side to side as she spoke. Her voice seemed to deepen and gurgle. I looked back at my wife and daughter.

“Get out of the car,” I whispered, a sense of horror overtaking me, but it was too late. A gray, sickly-looking tendril shot out of Mrs. Lukas’ mouth. It began to whip around wildly, my wife and daughter screaming as they felt for the door handles. Mrs. Lukas’ arms began to make strange snapping noises, lengthening as she raised them towards me. It looked like the bone and joints were being broken and re-forming in front of my eyes, purplish bruises and bursting capillaries forming all up and down on the skin of her arms. Her fingers were turning black, the nails turning blue, as if she were dying or already dead. I backed up out of the car slowly, raising the shotgun. My wife and daughter still weren’t out of the car, but I was out of time.

“Get down!” I yelled at them, hoping they heard me in time. Then I pulled the trigger.

The slug blew a hole the size of a grapefruit in Mrs. Lukas’ chest, then kept going, shattering the passenger side window. Her mouth opened, the jaw disengaging like a snake’s as she hissed, spewing a fountain of blood towards me. I moved at the last second, and the projectile bloody vomit missed my face by mere inches, falling harmlessly in the corn field behind me.

The smell of gunpowder mixed with something else that I had never smelled before. It was a smell like vomit and ammonia mixed together, and it got stronger the closer I was to the tendrils. A black fluid with iridescent rainbows shimmering in it leaked out of the damaged tendrils around her chest, tiny worms swarming and writhing in the alien blood as it soaked the seat and floor of the SUV.

My ears were ringing from shooting the shotgun, but I could hear the muffled sounds of my wife and daughter still screaming. I pulled open the back door and yanked Sarah out, then gave Beth a hand. Small, red tendrils erupted out of Mrs. Lukas’ chest, languidly feeling around the windshield and back seat before seeming to run out of energy, falling limply to the floor of the car.

“Is Mrs. Lukas alright?” Sarah asked in her little voice, looking up at me. She had her little pink backpack on. My wife kneeled down next to her and whispered something in her ear. It felt like I couldn’t talk. I just stood there, breathing fast, my vision covered in a white shimmering as waves of adrenaline and anxiety overtook me.

I did not want to get back into that car. I didn’t know how contagious the blood was, but I remembered the warning on the radio- “Don’t even wash your hands with the water.” Could touching contaminated blood infect me or my family? I didn’t know, and I didn’t want to find out.

“Come on,” I said, grabbing the bags from the back seat and handing them to my family, “we’re walking from here. It might be better anyway. The military might be tracking cars by helicopter or satellite.” I remembered seeing movies where evil corporations or governments shot anyone who tried to escape a quarantine area, and shivers ran down my spine.

“Jason, look,” my wife said in horror, pointing behind me. I looked at the spot where her trembling finger pointed.

The projectile blood that Mrs. Lukas had vomited before her death had settled into the dirt. A few earthworms writhed on top of the soil, elongating and mutating in front of my eyes. Within seconds, they had grown to a couple feet long, sharp red spikes extruding through their slimy skin. Tiny eyes on stalks were sprouting from the fronts of their bodies at an incredible speed, dozens of little black orbs that vibrated and searched the surrounding environment. Then new mouths opened beneath the eyes, with teeth as thin as needles poking out from their searching maws.

“Get back,” I said, trying to push my family back from the mutating worms. The worms all responded to the sound of my voice, raising their heads like snakes who smell prey, and a few began slithering in my direction. “Run!” We all started sprinting down the street. The worms creeped behind us at an unbelievable pace, almost catching up with me even as I sprinted as fast as I could. As my family and I all ran for our lives, I chambered a round of buckshot in the shotgun, then turned rapidly and shot at the few worms behind us.

The spread of the shotgun blast took out all three of them, stopping them instantly. Tendrils a few inches long shot out of their bodies, searching for a moment before falling onto the pavement. I put another round of buckshot in the chamber for good measure, but nothing else moved around us.

Then I heard a strange humming coming from further down the road. I turned to my wife.

“Do you hear that?” I asked in a low voice. She nodded.

“It almost sounds like a Tibetan singing bowl,” she said. I looked at her blankly. “It is a resonant bowl used for meditation that produces a humming sound.” Beth knew all about yoga and meditation.

“I don’t like it,” I said. Walking forward slowly, I saw a crowd of people standing around in a circle in a grassy field, all of them with their mouths opened, their faces pointing up at the sky. The writhing tendrils of the infection burst out of their skins, endlessly searching in the warm air. Sometimes the tendrils would wrap around one another, and towards the center of the circle, one thick vine sent out from the chest of every monster intertwined. A smell like starter fluid and vomit rose from the group, so pungent that I could almost taste it.

Before I knew what was happening, I felt the muzzle of a rifle push into the side of my head. A man dressed in all black was hiding at the edge of the tobacco field. He had used my temporary distraction to gain the advantage over me.

“Drop the gun, slowly,” he whispered through his gas mask. “And don’t make a sound. If you draw those things over here, you and your family will surely die.” He spoke calmly, equally, as if he were stating a fact rather than making a threat. I slowly put my hands up, the shotgun loosely held in my right one, then tossed the shotgun in a patch of grass. It fell with a soft thud. None of the members of the mutated group noticed the sound, however.

“Do you see them?” the man with the gun whispered to me. “They’re forming a hive mind. They’re exchanging genetic materials. This thing evolves fast.”

“How do you know?” I asked, and he only chuckled.

“Come on,” he said, lowering his gun. “You and your family are to come with me. There is a scientific installation nearby that is still quarantined and secure. We’re taking the uninfected survivors there until we get new orders.” I looked behind me at my family, going over to join them. His words struck a chord of anxiety in me, “until we get new orders”, but I wasn’t sure why.

“What’s your name?” I asked the man quietly.

“You can just call me X,” he said. “And I already know yours, Jason. We have been monitoring cameras located all over the town, as well as tracking the movement of vehicles by satellite. The government plans to restore order in this town block by block, and if it can’t be done, then the place will be wiped off the map. There can be no risk of this thing spreading beyond here.” Behind X, in the tobacco fields, I saw two more soldiers dressed in all black. They were also wearing gas masks and carrying M4 carbines with sound suppressors screwed in at the ends. X nodded at them and made some sort of hand gesture, and the two other soldiers fell in at both sides of myself and my family.

It involved going through the field on the opposite side of the road as the hive of monsters. As we moved, the crunching of our feet on the grass the only sound besides that humming coming from the field, I realized the sky was darkening. Flashes of lightning lit up the horizon.

I heard someone screaming from the field across the road. My first thought was that one of the monsters had spotted us and was alerting its fellows as to our presence. All of us whipped around, the soldiers raising their weapons, but I quickly realized it was highly unlikely any of the monsters could even see us. We were hidden behind a curve in the tobacco field, looking through some of the plants to observe them. And the rapid darkening of the sky would likely make it even harder to spot our silhouettes.

Instead of the monsters looking for others outside their group, two new ones were bringing someone in. I squinted, trying to see harder. The prisoner looked like a skinny young man or maybe a teenager. He had wiry black hair and glasses. He shrieked and fought against his captors the entire way, but they easily overpowered him. The tendrils of the captors had wrapped around his arms and hands, like living chains. They otherwise did not touch him, except for a small gray vine that would escape from one of their mouths, caress the hostages cheeks and forehead, then disappear back into the host’s body. It almost gave me the impression that the hive mind wanted to keep him calm, or maybe it was just sampling the goods.

As soon as the hostage was within a few feet of the group, the circle scattered, seeming to regain much of their individuality. The prisoner looked around feverishly, then seemed to notice our group. I don’t know if it was the glint of some light off one of the rifles or some flash of color from our clothing, but he looked right at us. Then he began screaming, the vines wrapping faster and faster around his legs.

“Help me!” he said, trying to point as a gray tendril wrapped around his mouth, gagging him. The monsters in the group noticed his agitation and yelling and also looked over in our direction. I was trying to crouch lower to the ground. The soldiers were feverishly whispering to each other. Then, as one member gnawed open a red tendril with his bare teeth, others began running in our direction. I saw the gray tendril wrapped around the hostage’s mouth pull away, and the one issuing the black fluid took its place. It forced the young man to drink, wrapping underneath his lips as fluid spurted out of it in an arterial fashion. I nearly gagged just watching it.

“We have to go!” X said to me, the first glint of excitement and bloodlust in his eyes. I stood up quickly, watching Sarah and Beth jog in front of me, hand-in-hand, as X led the way. The other two soldiers stayed behind us, and I caught glimpses of them checking our backs multiple times. The monsters were gaining on us, and if we were going much farther, I had a feeling we wouldn’t make it- at least not without a gunfight.

Those nearest to us out of the group began to run at a superhuman speed. My daughter could not keep up with the soldiers, so I picked her up and began to sprint. It was clear that we were not getting away. Then I heard sniper rifles begin shooting from the forest up ahead, and I sighed in relief, my heart bursting in my chest from the effort of sprinting while carrying a 40-pound child and a backpack full of supplies.

The forest was only thirty or forty yards away. The soldiers stopped, let my wife and I pass by, then began to open fire with their rifles. The gunshots were deafening, even though none of them were using full-auto bursts. Between the hidden snipers and the three soldiers, they were taking down five or six of the mutated people every few seconds. There was a screaming sound from one of the monsters, like a wailing infant, and the rest of the group immediately stopped and scattered in all directions. A few more shots rang out and a couple more bodies fell across the field, but then everything was quiet.

All I could hear was the ringing in my ears and the heavy breathing of my daughter and myself. I got a bottle of water out of the backpack, drinking the whole thing and giving another bottle to her. She just stared at it for a few seconds.

“Are we getting out of here?” she asked. My wife looked down at her in surprise.

“Of course we are getting out of here,” my wife said. “Why would you think otherwise?” My daughter pointed to the dead bodies littering the field.

“None of those people are getting out of here,” Sarah said. I saw the three soldiers entering the forest. X was looking at us with an inscrutable expression.

“We have a much larger group headed this way,” he said to us. “Satellite imagery shows it may have over five hundred people. Apparently the first phase has ended, and the second has begun.”

“What do you mean by ‘first phase’?” my wife asked him. He shrugged.

“The chaotic nature of the transformations, some of the mutants ripping others apart. Total psychotic breakdowns in predisposed individuals. All of that kept them disorganized, easy to kill as long as you had weapons. But if they are forming into larger and larger hiveminds, then that will not continue. It means our time to get out of here is quickly running out.” He started walking forward again, motioning for us to follow. “But luckily, the scientific installation is only a few hundred yards away. We have time to get there and barricade it, if necessary. They may not even know where it is or how to find it.”

“There’s nothing out this way,” I replied. “This is all woods and fields for the next few miles, and then you get to the national park, which is another twenty miles of forests.” X shook his head, smiling slightly.

“You’ll see.” The other two soldiers didn’t talk at all. They looked unhappy and were reloading their guns. We followed X on a deer trail, and a few minutes later, entered an abandoned barn. He walked directly to the center of it, clearing off ancient-looking hay and twigs, and revealed a number pad, where he entered a series of numbers so fast that I couldn’t follow the sequence. There was a quiet beeping sound, and a round, concrete entrance opened up, revealing a ladder that went into a well-lit hallway a story below.

We climbed down one by one. My wife, daughter and I were redirected into a room with a couch and a television. The cable and power down here had apparently never been affected like it was in the rest of the town. I opened up my phone and found that they had open wifi access down here, and began to write up my story.

After a few minutes, the soldiers came back, all of them having a sour expression on their faces.

“The head scientists are MIA, for now,” X said, frowning. “We will have to wait. I have no idea where they are or what they’re doing. They were supposed to wait here for rescue. Part of my orders are to get them out of here.” I nodded to him, handing out peanut butter crackers and water to my family while I finished writing the story on my phone. X didn’t seem to notice or care.

Across the facility, I heard another beeping sound, and the faint noise of a door opening. The echo of muffled voices reached out to us across the polished hallways and laboratory rooms.

Apparently, the wait was over.
