*“Help!” is the first thing that escapes my raspy throat as I see the way out.*

*Please come soon.*

“Help” is the first thing I hear when I’m jolted awake in the middle of the night. Those first few seconds when you wake up are the most disorientating seconds of the day for most people, which is why I chose to believe this horrible cry for help was that of a fleeting nightmare which had followed me back to the safety of my home.

But as I sat there for a few more seconds that were being stretched to minutes, the call came again, “Please! Anyone!” I looked down at my phone, about to call the police, when I thought it would be better if I went to investigate first. It would be fine, all I had to do was peek through the blinds and get a better look. As I reached for the doorknob to my bedroom, the voice made another call for help, but this time it sounded closer, the thoughts started creeping in as I began to open the door.

Don’t go out there.

Let someone else take care of it. 

Go back to sleep.

But I couldn’t do that and wake up with a good conscience. I stepped into my cold hallway, making my way towards the window in the living room, when I saw it. A bright light shining in? Who the hell was shining a spotlight directly into my home? Maybe some late-night construction crew left it on. I turned the corner to go and close the blinds when I stopped in my tracks, trying to take in some impossible information. There was a glass door on the other side of my living room, letting in the mid-afternoon sun, showing a lush forest filled with beautiful birch trees. 

When the brain doesn’t understand something, it tries its damnedest to make the puzzle pieces fit, so when I looked at this door to a forest out the back of my apartment in the city, four floors up, my head started to spin.

I take small steps towards the door, shyly like approaching a friend's dog that doesn't know you yet. I place just a finger against it, feeling the cold glass, then a whole hand taking in this wonderful landscape that’s chosen my dingy little home to rest in. “Help!” the call came again, breaking the few seconds of comfort and intrigue, replacing it with the same uncertainty and fear I felt seeing it for the first time.

I was having a dream, this was the only logical response I could come up with. I need to get back in my bed and forget this. I retreated from the door, my mind still unsure about the only logic I could throw at this impossible door. The cries and yells followed me back to my room, the pleas fell on my ears as I pulled a pillow over my face to drown them out. And before I knew it, I was staring at the window, seeing the sunrise, listening to the screams fade and fall silent.

I sprinted out of my bedroom. I had to know, it felt so real down to the touch. So when I’m staring at the blank, boring wall that’s always been my living room, I was a little disappointed. Sitting there for longer than necessary, I thought about the way I felt when I took it all in. It felt like something new, exciting, and an adventure to go on. But I had no more time to think about this fading dream, it was time to go to work.

The day dragged on, the same problems as last week leaked in, this wasn’t taken care of, that guy's sick today, can you do this? All these monotonous tasks dragged on and on, but with the lack of decent sleep, I could barely keep my eyes open. But the oddest thing was, unlike any of the other dreams I’ve had in my life, this one refused to fade into the background of my mind. I thought about that door all day to the point of obsessiveness. I was somewhat excited to go back to bed and try to dream about it again.

Later on in the evening, back home, I finished cleaning up and sat down to enjoy some crap tv before I would head off to bed. I couldn’t decide on what I wanted to lose the next couple of hours to and defaulted to just scrolling on my phone for a while, watching time trickle by.

*“Help!”*         

I snapped my head around to see it again. The door. Had I fallen asleep? I quickly got up panting with excitement, running over to the door and looking out to the lush forest that was in my thoughts all day. I took it all in again as if for the first time. Seeing it again was like a shot of adrenaline. This time, I knew I wasn’t dreaming. I’ve never felt more awake.

I decided not to waste anytime, someone out there was calling for help, probably for days and from the sounds of their voice, they wouldn’t last much longer. I couldn’t explain this to anyone, they would think I was mad, and by the time I could show them this wonder, the person on the other side would perish. I gathered what I thought would be useful: hiking boots, a first aid kit, and anything that would help. I turned back to face the glass door, gripping the handle delicately as if I would shatter the door and the illusion by being too rough with it. Slowly, the door opened, letting me hear the birds chirp with delight. The sounds of the door pushing against dead leaves echoed between my home and the birds, all that was left was to step through.

I began to walk in the direction of the cries while trying to hold onto my resolve, not letting my fear overtake me and run back into my home and forget this whole idea. I took in the landscape around me. This dense, lush forest seemed to go on forever, its branches stretching high into the sky, covering almost everything, leaving spots of shade. After I take this person back to safety, it might be possible to find some people to survey the area. This could be one of the greatest discoveries of our time, I had to share it when I get back.

The longer I walked, the calls for help sounded closer but came with more desperation, so for the first time, I called out to them. “Hello! Can you hear me? I’ve come to help you” Nothing. I tried again. “You don’t have to be scared, I’ve come to help!” Finally, a weak call came off to my side. 

*“Please get me out”*

I turned to face the tree while reassuring them, “It’s going to be okay, I’ll get you hom-” My words died in my throat as I laid my eyes on this desperate, dying creature. I had no idea if this was a person anymore, but the sadness and tears in their eye told me everything.

*“It hurts”*

My brain faced the same problem of the door, an impossible thing to look at, puzzle pieces that would not fit. This person, whoever they were, was suffering more than I could know. Their mouth poked through the bark, kept making small, desperate pleas, knowing that I could do nothing to save them. “I’m sorry I-I don’t know what to do.” 

*“Please go get help, you need to go, it’ll come back”*

The desperate pleas for their freedom now turned into muffled yelling as the bark began to grow over what was left of them.

*“LOOK AT THE TREES”*

These were the last words they could get out, as I could only stand there and watch as they fully bonded together, making them fall silent forever. My heart was pounding out of my chest. I need to go, I need to go home, forget and never tell anyone. I looked around madly at the forest, the feeling as if I’ve done something very wrong had taken me over, the now silent forest making its presence known as the thoughts came back again.

Which way did I come from?

How long had I been walking for?

Why are the birds quiet?

This last question haunted me the most as I thought about the poor soul’s last words to me. 

Look. at. the. trees. 

A snap of a dead twig behind me sent me into a full sprint into the forest, not knowing which way to go, I ran anyway as the sounds of large footsteps crunched down on the forest floor behind me. The sounds between the steps were far apart. I couldn’t tell if they were taking long steps or just toying with me. 

I refused to look behind and kept running while the distance between the trees became shorter and the forest became denser. I saw in the distance, in a clearing, a small black rectangle. 

The sounds of the crushing, looming footsteps were still close behind me, and I was exhausted from running for so long. I have to keep going. The trees were closing in, leaving nothing but a small gap at the end. It’s a snare, this forest is a snare. My muscles aching, my legs throbbing in pain, tears streaming down my face, I threw myself through the small gap as it closed, hearing the colossal sounds come to an abrupt stop. 

Breathing heavily on the ground, I slowly rose off the ground and looked at the door. The morning sun could be seen through my living room windows. “No!” Pushing my body one more time towards the door, I reached out my hand to grab the handle, only for my hand to grasp onto the empty air where the door was. I fell to my knees, exhausted, listening to the trees part as the footsteps slowly approached behind me. The snare had gone off. I had been caught. 

I opened my eyes to see nothing in front of me. Total darkness. I hoped once I woke up, I would be back in bed, but with my hands against the scratchy wooden lid in front of me, I sobbed, realising this was no longer an option.

Time passed until I heard something begin to creak against the sides of my coffin. Then a split as the old wood gave way, letting in a small amount of soil with something slithering through it. Slowly, I begin to feel a tight grip take hold of my wrist. Before I had a chance to pull away, the root stabbed itself directly into my chest. The pain was excruciating. I could feel the root spread itself through my body. 

Days passed As my body began to change. What was happening to me?

Weeks passed I was growing quickly. My body was pushing against the box and through the soil. Stretching longer than should be possible, how was I still alive?

Soon I saw the sun for the first time in months. I could finally see myself again. But as I looked around in horror, I saw what had been done to me. My limbs stretched high into the sky, my body joining the dense greenery, leaving only a small part of myself to see what was to come.

I looked around the same unchanging scene for days before I finally saw it. It blends in perfectly against the birch, no wonder I didn’t spot it. When it wants to be, it can be as quiet as a mouse. But this entire time, its two small eyes had been watching me take shape. Its many limbs took the form of branches easily reaching out. When it noticed that I had seen it, it fled off into the forest so quickly you wouldn't have known it was there in the first place.

Watching it left me with a sense of dread I had never felt. What was it planning on doing with me? with us? 

It needs more camouflage.

By the time I saw the door again, I was in indescribable amounts of pain. I could see in the distance that there was someone else's furniture in my apartment, had it really been that long? I could see a silhouette standing in the door.

I pulled my body, but I was too far stretched apart in this state, my body was turning, I’m panicking, I have no way out, they need to come get me, I need-

*“Help!” is the first thing that escapes my raspy throat*

*Please come soon*
