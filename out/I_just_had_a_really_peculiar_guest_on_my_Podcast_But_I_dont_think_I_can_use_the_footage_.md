I received a letter in the mail the other day from a man asking to be on my podcast. I thought this was strange because seldom do the things I do in the digital world bleed over to reality. But he stated he was an older gentleman and it was easier for him to communicate this way. He informed me that he was a writer and promised to be a compelling guest on my show. 

It should be noted that I am by no means a celebrity, and my podcast has very few viewers. I just talk to people in my community who seem interesting and it's been a fun, although unrewarding hobby. I will sometimes go live on the internet for the show, and there is always one anonymous viewer in the chat. But that's okay. 

Needless to say, I replied to the man with a short letter of my own, telling him that it would be fun to have him on the show. Through smaller correspondence I gave him my address and set a meeting time for a few weeks out. I anxiously awaited the day because I suppose there was some fear over meeting a person you've only written a letter to. 

When the day finally came, the man rang my doorbell at precisely the time we had agreed to meet. I peaked out the window but did not see a car in the driveway, a curious fact considering the rural nature of my location. 

I opened the door and extended my hand “you must be Mr.Lydon, pleasure to meet you.” 

“And you as well.” He was well over twice my age, and looked just slightly older than my father. His hair was silver and he wore coke bottle glasses, he also wore a brown suit and tie, but despite this, still looked casual in his attire. 

“Please, tell me you didn't walk all this way?” I asked, gesturing for him to enter the threshold of my home. He removed his cap.

“It was really no trouble, no trouble at all.” 

I offered him a drink before explaining to him how the recording process was going to work. But I assured him it was simple. I led him to my garage where I kept my recording equipment.

“You see, it's kinda like having your own broadcast studio in your home. I got the camera and the microphone, all we have to do is sit in front of the lights and talk and it will stream live on the internet.” he seemed fascinated by it all, and i was glad because i put a lot of time and effort making my basement look like a late night talk show of sorts. 

We sat in two identical chairs that faced each other and I began the live feed.

“Hey guys, welcome back to the show. Mr.Anonymous, it's good to see you in the chat as usual.” I said. He had never replied to my greetings but I still  felt that he watched my broadcast intently. I was never sure why, but having at least one viewer made it feel like I wasn't just doing this all for nothing and talking into the void that is the internet. “Today I am with Mr.Lydon who is an author in my local area. We've been talking Via Mail to set up this interview. And that's been a fascinating journey back in time, let me tell you. Anyway, Mr.Lydon if you'd like to introduce yourself.” 

“Of course, as you mentioned. I am Mr.Lydon. A writer, a veteran, and a loving father.” 

Now, one thing I've learned about doing a good interview is that you let your guests talk. You have to let them be the star of the show, and Mr.Lydon was easily one of the most fascinating people I had spoken to. 

He told me, and my one anonymous viewer, his life story. He was a steel mill worker before he got shipped off to Vietnam, where an infected wound cost him his leg. Making his walk to my home even more impressive. 

When I asked him to talk about his literary work though, he became somewhat agitated and shifted in his chair. He paused to think. “I have some short stories that were published long ago, mostly in magazines, all of which are probably out of print by now.”

“And what was that like, that experience? Do they still print magazines anymore?” 

“It was empty,” He said. “I wrote countless stories. That's how I spent my time. That was my craft. That was the love of my life. Telling stories to no one.” 

I found his statement to be relatable, as I often feel like I too am doing the same thing. He went on.

“But what all my stories share in common, other than the fact that no one read them,” He laughed. “Is what they don't say.” 

I raised my eyebrow. 

“None of them say, I love you son.”  He said

If i could have raised my eyebrow any higher, i would have.

“I've spent many years wondering, what sense there was in yammering on in my fantasy worlds, using words to eloquently express my passing fascination with wizards and dragons if i never moved them to leave a trail, if i never hid between every word a simple message that meant, i love you?”

By now i had noticed that he was speaking of his writing in a past tense, implying it was something he no longer does, i feared perhaps he was alluding to the possibility that his son had passed on, and that it was too late to use his writing as a way to express his love for him. But I had to ask. “Is it too late to write such a story?” 

“With your help, Perhaps not,” he replied. 

He promptly stood, and shook my hand and thanked me for my time. He tipped his hat to me and said goodbye. Then he declined the offer for a ride home, I watched him walk out of the driveway and disappear into the night. I worried for his safety and asked him to write to me again sometime. 

When I closed the door I immediately returned to my computer to watch the video back to myself. But before i closed the feed out i noticed there was a message from my anonymous viewer, it simply said “Thank You.” he was out of the chat already but i still responded to his message. It was when I played the recording back of the interview though, that I understood.

We must have spoken for at least forty five minutes, and of all that video there was nothing more than a recording of me talking to myself.
