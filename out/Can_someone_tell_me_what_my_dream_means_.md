So last night before I went to sleep I was talking to my nephew telling him how I haven’t had a nightmare in a long time, well I guess I jinxed myself because last night I had one. So I went to sleep and this is what happened… 

I was at this house with a group of friends and they called over more people to come over to go swimming so I was like okay let me go home and grab my things, so in the dream me, the girl who I was friends with in the dream, and her mom all got picked up by my mom from the house where we were at.. she took us back to my real house that I currently live in now and the 3 of us all went into my house to grab some stuff while my mom waited in the car. So the 3 of us go upstairs to my room to pack a couple of things when all of a sudden from downstairs I hear a child who wasn’t supposed to be there say “mom” now mind you this child sounded young maybe 4 years old or so… 

In the dream I knew it wasn’t real and it was a spirit so I didn’t tell my friend and her mom.. until a few minutes later this child would not stop calling for “mom” so this is when my friend told me and her mom that she heard someone downstairs calling for mom then that’s when I was like yeah I heard that too, so her mom ended up going downstairs to check it out. So as me and my friend are sitting there we’re talking and we have the tv on in the background aswell but then we hear this child who’s a spirit throwing a temper tantrum downstairs and the mom was trying to calm him down but he just wouldn’t he was constantly screaming and crying and wouldn’t stop… 

So this is when we look at eachother and decide how we’re gonna escape from this situation because we knew something was off… so we talked about jumping out the window from my dads room but then I told her I didn’t want to go in there because I was scared since he has both a walk in closet and bathroom in his bedroom and I told her that I had a feeling something was hiding in either one of those rooms… so we made a plan to just book it down the stairs and run right out the door we were just waiting for the right time. So we hear this disagreement between the mother and child get worse because the mother wanted to leave the ghost child to come back upstairs with us but as soon as she brought up that idea the child started screaming very loudly… the mom counted to 4 and as soon as she said 4 the child screamed louder than he did my whole dream and that’s when me and my friend decided to make a run for it. 

We run down the stairs and I hurry up and grab my shoes off the stairs and we run right out the door with the mother following us but the child nowhere to be found. So we run out to my mom who’s waiting in her car right outside my house and me and my friend get in right away but her mom is still standing on my sidewalk outside my house, all the lights in my house we’re still on aswell as the tv in my room and the door was wide open and she’s just standing there not getting in the car, so I’m staring at my house in shock and disbelief due to what’s going on when all of a sudden I started to faint in my dream as i was staring at my house, right before I completely passed out I used the last of my strength to get up and start praying immediately, and my mom started driving away from the house but my friend had gotten out the car at the time I fainted to go stand there with her mother in front of my house so by the time I gained enough consciousness to start praying I seen my friend and her mother outside of my house and my mom began to drive away leaving them behind, as we were driving off I was sitting in the back seat watching my friend and her mom chase after us as I was praying in my dream but my mom didn’t wanna stop and wait for them and then at this time is when I woke up in real life. 

Mind you in real life I’m not sure who the girl or her mother are. I’ve been trying to think all morning on what this dream could mean because I was definitely scared in my dream due to the presence of the ghosts.
