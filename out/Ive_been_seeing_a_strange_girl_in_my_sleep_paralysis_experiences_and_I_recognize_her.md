  

Have you ever experienced the phenomenon known as sleep paralysis? Well, if you haven’t, let me give you some insight into the concept of it.

Sleep paralysis is when you wake up from sleep but you aren’t able to move a muscle. You can’t even lift a finger. During this state, you may start to hallucinate things; horrifying things.

After a couple of minutes, you’d be able to wake back up and move your body again and the hallucinations will disappear like they never came.

I’ve always experienced sleep paralysis ever since I was a teen but it got worse and more rapid when I moved out of my parent’s house. The very first night I slept here, I got sleep paralysis. It was horrible. 

Your body would feel like it’s being crushed. You can barely breathe and, of course, start hallucinating and seeing things. Every time I got sleep paralysis, I saw different beings. I’d see a shadow man, a wicked old lady with her eyes gouged out, a walking body of nothing but flesh, a creepy little girl, a man made out of snakes, and a tall and slender man with tentacles. Those are scarce things that barely even scratch the surface.

This continued for four months. I got sleep paralysis at least five times a week and I had gotten pretty used to it.

It was a chilly and dry Saturday and since it was the weekend, I didn’t have to go to work. This meant I could stay indoors all day. Even if I wanted to go out, the sound of heavy rain drumming on the window was stopping me from leaving and I could barely see out the windows from how brutally it rained. 

I spent the whole day watching a TV show, scrolling on my phone, and helping myself to some sweets. It was a lazy uninteresting day for me.

Night had arrived and I knew I was going to get sleep paralysis because I only had it three times that whole week. After turning the lamp light off, I hopped in bed and braced myself for the upcoming sleep paralysis. I shut my eyes and tried to fall asleep.

My eyes sluggishly opened up and began to adjust to the darkness of the room. My room would usually be lit up by the moonlight but when my eyes drifted to the window next to me, I saw that it was still violently raining.

I attempted to move my body but I couldn’t. I felt the pressure on my chest that I would always feel during sleep paralysis.

The sleep paralysis had already begun. I braced myself for the hallucinations that awaited me. 

Minutes must have passed and I was waiting for something to emerge out of the darkness of my room’s corners but nothing came. I couldn’t tell how many minutes passed but it felt like a solid 5 minutes of me being paralyzed and waiting for the hallucinations to start.

This was the first time this had happened to me.

Because of this delay in hallucinations, I was starting to feel a bit creeped out. I hadn’t felt afraid of sleep paralysis due to how much I got used to it.

But this one broke the cycle.

Was there something there that I just couldn’t see because of the darkness? 

That’s when it finally began. 

In the corner of my room, I saw the silhouette of something. I couldn’t tell what it was but there was a figure standing there. It then began to gradually glide towards me. That’s when I saw how it looked. It was a girl. 

It wasn’t something scary or frightening. 

It was just a normal girl.

It was a girl who looked like she was in her teens with blonde pigtails and skin that glowed even in the darkness of my room. This girl seemed like someone I’d seen before. 

Someone I’d forgotten about. 

She then came to a stop at the end of my bed. That’s when she did something that shook me to my core.

“Do you remember me, Charlie?” she questioned in a soft voice, tilting her head.

I was taken aback by the girl talking to me. It was rare for a sleep paralysis vision to talk or make any noise really.

That’s when I felt my voice. It felt like I had regained my voice box.

I could talk*.* 

My breaths were shallow and my heart was hammering on my ribs and quickly it was.

Was this really sleep paralysis?

I tried to move my body but like always, it didn’t budge at all. But I could talk and that is something that doesn’t occur during sleep paralysis to my information.

I tried not to make a sound and stayed silent. The rain had come to a stop and the moonlight had returned, lighting up the room. I could see the girl more clearly.

She had wide eyes, like a doll and she was wearing an outfit that looked a bit too small for her; a shirt with stripes on it and tight shorts.

“Charlie. I’m asking you again. Do you remember me?” the girl asked again. 

I figured the only way of silencing her question would be to answer it.

“Um…no?” I whimpered, trying to hide the fear in my voice. I was having an actual conversation with a sleep-paralysis hallucination. That is if it was sleep paralysis. “Oh. I knew you wouldn’t remember me,” she admitted, looking down at the ground. She looked melancholy.

“W-Who are you?” I asked.

“I’ll let you figure that out yourself,” she explained, smiling at me.

“H-How am I talking to you?! Is this really sleep paralysis?!” I questioned.

The girl giggled for a while.

“Silly Charlie.” She said.

The conversation was abruptly interrupted when she began choking on the air. She clasped her throat tightly and began to cry for help. The beautifulness of her presence vanished in a matter of seconds as she began to sink into the floor as if she was being sucked downwards.

I could do nothing but watch in horror.

“IM DROWNING! HELP!” she roared before her hand finally disappeared through the floor. She was gone. My heart was racing faster than ever.

That’s when I woke up. I was gasping for air and my pillow seemed wet. I bolted up and sat on my bed, panting. I looked around. It was already morning.

It *was* sleep paralysis.

I let out a breath of relief but I questioned how I managed to talk midway through the paralysis.

That whole day at work was me spending most of my time trying to not reflect on sleep paralysis but all that did was made me think about it more.

My mind was also thinking about that girl. She seemed familiar in a way. She looked like someone I recognized but I couldn’t tell if she was someone I knew.

After work, I was completely wasted. sleepy beyond belief, I opened my apartment door and strolled over to the nearest couch. I dropped backward on the couch and let out a long and deep sigh.

After a couple of minutes of rest, I got up and began to head to my room when I accidentally knocked over a box next to the couch. A cluster of various items fell out and began rolling all around the floor.

It was all pictures, ornaments, and junk that I had forgotten to throw out and instead kept in a box.

“Goddammit,” I said under my breath as I bent down and began to pick up the items and put them back in the box. That’s when I found something that caught my eye.

It was a picture – a Polaroid picture. 

It was a photo of my old school camping trip I had years back. The nostalgia waved over me as I couldn’t help but smile while looking at the photo of my old friends and I began to remember the dumb stuff we did on that trip.

My eyes analyzed the picture and then fell on her. 

My eyes began to widen as I dropped the picture in shock. My heart began racing again.

She was at the far right, trying to hide. She had blonde pigtails and skin that glowed. She had wide eyes like a doll and she was wearing an outfit that looked a bit too small for her; a shirt with stripes on it and tight shorts.

It was the same girl I’d seen in my sleep paralysis. 

I took the picture with my shaking hand and examined it once more. It was really her.

That’s when I began to recall all of it. Her name was Melanie Campbell.

She was one of my classmates back then. I didn’t know her much at all. She was quiet and was honestly a bit creepy. 

The only reason me and almost everyone know her is the fact that she went missing on that camping trip. We had to finish the trip earlier than we needed to since she went disappeared from our pack.

Rumors spread around about where she went. People say she got abducted. Others say she got murdered by one of the teachers and some even say she drowned.

Needless to say, her body was never found. To think that I had forgotten her even when I saw her in my sleep paralysis.

Wait, I saw her in my sleep paralysis. Why was she there?

A cold chill ran down my spine and my hair began to stand up.

I shoved the picture in the box and tried to forget about it.

It was so random. I had completely forgotten that she even existed and all of a sudden, I see her in my sleep paralysis. 

I headed to my room and undressed before getting in bed to get some shuteye. It was already pretty late so I figured I would go to sleep and not only was it late but I was mentally and physically drained.

I rolled over to my side in bed and tried to fall asleep. I tried my hardest not to think about the sleep paralysis I had the night before.

It must’ve been a couple of minutes before I finally fell asleep.

I was woken up by the sound of booming thunder. I jumped and began to look around the room.

My eyes then landed on her once again.

I knew who she was as soon as I saw her.

It was Melanie, standing at the foot of my bed.

My heart was already beating fast because of the thunder but it began to beat even faster. I tried to move my body but it stayed paralyzed. Sleep paralysis had begun.

I looked over at Melanie.

She was wearing the same clothes as last time but this time her clothes were soaking wet to the point where I heard the water dripping on the floor. 

Melanie’s hair was bright and blonde when I saw her the night before, but it was dull and desaturated this time.

Her glowing skin wasn’t glowing anymore. Her skin looked as if it was decomposing, like the rotting skin of a dead body. She looked like…she died.

She looked like a dead corpse.

“Well, well, Charlie. Sorry, I made you wake up,” Melanie apologized. Her voice didn’t sound soft like last time before. It was cold and monotone now.

“Charlie. Do you still not know me?” she asked, tilting her head like last time.

I regained my voice again. I could talk but not move just like the last time.

“Uh, y-yeah. You’re Melanie Campbell…right?” I asked, hesitantly. She could tell that I was scared from my voice shaking.

Melanie giggled.

“I see. You finally figured it out,” she replied.

“You’re probably wondering how I’m in your sleep paralysis. Let me explain a few things before I need to do what I need to do,” she added.

“You see, all the beings you see in sleep paralysis were all once human. We are reborn as sleep paralysis hallucinations after we die. This is called the sleep paralysis realm. 

“When we were humans, we all were people who experienced sleep paralysis more often than others. It was a curse. The only way to pass the curse is by being killed by someone. Then, the curse gets passed on to the murderer. I had sleep paralysis often as a human and it got passed on to the person that killed me.

“If a person who suffered this curse dies of natural causes and wasn’t murdered, they get eternal peace. But if they get murdered, they are reborn as a sleep paralysis hallucination and their job is to find the person that murdered them. If they find that person, then, they can leave the sleep paralysis realm and reach eternal peace in death,” Melanie finished.

I didn’t know what to say or think. My mind was running with thoughts but felt empty at the same time. The only thing I felt was fear.

“And Charlie, I have found the person that murdered me and that person is *you*,” Melanie announced with a twisted smile plastered on her rotting face.

“Years back on that camping trip, you pushed me into the lake while you were drunk. You already know I can’t swim. What’s worse is the fact that I had feelings for you, Charlie. But I drowned right there and my curse got passed on to you.

“I was reborn as a sleep paralysis hallucination. I’m not like the others who look monstrous. I’ve been searching far and wide to find you, going from house to house, and now, I finally found you.” She admitted.

“I’m not going to leave like the others. Instead, I will kill you.”
