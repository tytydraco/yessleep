Greetings, fellow readers! Welcome to my blog. I’m Isha Sharma. First of all, grab a cup of tea. Today I’m going to tell you all about myself while you all can enjoy the tea.

My name is Isha Sharma, and I’m a passionate reader just like you. I recently discovered my love for reading, right after dropping out of college. Yes, now you all know I’m a dropout. I was pursuing my BA Hons. in Economics from UPES, Dehradun. Dream City, right? I know, but what went wrong?

When I graduated from high school, I just wanted to get out of my city, Jaipur, or Pink City, as we say. The intent was to get my higher education at DU, but I didn't meet the expected criteria. Then a friend of mine suggested UPES. After researching the college, I found it to be a cool and nice place to study, and also far away from home, which was a win-win situation for me.

Studying in Dehradun turned out to be one of my worst decisions. Like Ryan Reynolds says, “When you have expectations, you are setting yourself up for disappointment." There, I was doing everything except studying. Partying till late, skipping classes, smoking marijuana and losing touch with my core personality. And not to forget my increased levels of intoxications. Those group sittings and puffing which many of you can relate. The peer group you find at college plays important role in your life ahead. Today, one in every 5 youth are influenced with weeds or something… I became one of them officially. 
Well,finally after wasting a year and a half, I came to my senses and decided to drop out.

I went back to my sweet birthplace, Jaipur. Another bomb came right up; my breakup happened that very same year, right after leaving university. That breakup left me feeling lost, shattered, and unsure of what lay ahead. So, what did I do after dropping out? What happened after the breakup? These things must be running through your mind, right?

Well, obviously, like every mindful person, I also made a road map. After dropping out of university, I wanted to start my own venture. I made the right plan in which field I wanted to go and what business I wanted to do, did the research, and everything was in its place except the most important thing, ‘FUNDING’. I had zero capital. I could not ask anyone to fund my venture.

Then I thought maybe I should wait and save some money first. I did my very first job as a sales executive for the U.S. process. They paid me fair money. The plan was to save some funds and then invest them in my venture. Disappointment hit, and money was never saved. I quit the job and did nothing after that; I was just postponing everything.

Life has a way of surprising us with unexpected twists and turns. I was going through a phase where nothing was working out; I dropped out of university, a breakup happened, and I was not focused enough to even start my dream venture. It was like standing in a dark tunnel with no light. I was hurting and gave up hope for everything.

Then 2023 ended, and I wished everyone a Happy New Year. While the thought was running through my head, What’s so Happy and New about this year? You could describe that feeling as a feeling of stagnation, where I perceived that this year would be a repetition of the experiences and outcomes of the previous year. But a long time ago, my sister made this quote for my phone wallpaper: “Right things happen when you least expect them." 

2024 had a huge impact on me; it changed me completely. I did things I never thought I would do and stopped the ones which i thought i couldn’t. Like writing this blog or writing for the fact. Some people might be less expressive and less talkative. I was one of them; I would not let anyone know what was running through my head. For the first time, I wanted to talk and express whatever I was feeling. I wanted to say it all out loud. Sometimes, it's essential to let it all out and express ourselves. I think this way, we can experience the weight of our emotions and make room in our hearts for something new.

I am so glad to have such supportive people around me—my sisters and my buddies. During my dark phase, they were there, reminding me of my strength. Whether it was a late-night chat with my sisters filled with encouragement or an outing with my friends to eat my favorite comfort food, their gestures of compassion never failed to bring a smile to my face. They have been my constant supporters and good listeners.

Have you ever experienced a moment where you found hope again? Well, I was experiencing that moment where hope was finding its way back into my life. It's truly a beautiful feeling, isn't it? I started prioritizing myself. I enrolled in activities that bring peace and happiness, like cooking. I have always loved cooking, more specifically baking, I love to bake desserts; it calms my mind. Correspondingly, I enrolled myself in other activities as well, like yoga, meditation, and Hinge (a dating app). I know it was not my idea initially; we all know how friends are, but I am very glad to join Hinge. I met this very cute and like-minded guy. He has been the sweetest, most patient, and most compassionate man to me when I've needed him lately. His support has not only helped me through difficulties but has also inspired personal growth. It's a testament to the fact that even in the most unexpected places, we can find the support and love we need to navigate life's challenges.
Ending of 2023 also ended a phase which was changing me for the worst. The decision to quit marijuana hit as instant as 1 January after 31 December. 
It’s been 5 months in 2024 and this Isha is clean as glass. This was one of the best feeling which made me pat my back, for myself !!

Through the healing process, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery. I reconnected with forgotten passions, explored new hobbies, and nurtured relationships that brought me joy. The breakup and failures became a catalyst for personal growth, pushing me to redefine myself and embrace the person I was becoming.

While I was healing and learning new things, an opportunity came knocking on my door: social media and digital marketing. Not coming from this background, I had no knowledge about it, but I was very curious to learn and couldn't wait to try my hands on it. I was feeling like a hungry wolf. There is this saying, “A wolf climbing on the hill is hungrier than the wolf on the hill." I just had this one thing running through my mind constantly. I want to make it. I want to chase this feeling of a hungry wolf.

I got my certification in social media marketing from HubSpot Academy. The HubSpot Social Media Marketing Certification is a complete course that includes video lectures and quizzes after each video lecture. They cover everything from how to do social media marketing to why a business needs social media marketing and understanding the dynamics of social media ads. It is a complete package course. It’s better to take baby steps and master that one specific area rather than try to do it all at once and fool yourself by doing nothing at all. Like Dan Millman says, “A little bit of something is better than nothing.” I’m trying my best to be my best potential version, rather than being pushed down and feeling like a loser.

My mantra for 2024 is ‘Striving high and performing on it.’ That’s my anecdote. Now you all know me well enough, I guess. Through my blog, I hope to create a society where we can relate to and learn from each other.

 In wrapping up my self-introduction blog, let’s embark on this journey together, I invite you to share your own experiences and reflections in the comments below. Whether you've faced similar challenges or found inspiration in unexpected places, your voice adds richness to our community.

Let's connect, learn, and grow together. Together, we can transform this space into a vibrant hub of positivity and mutual support.

Cheers to new beginnings and shared adventures!
