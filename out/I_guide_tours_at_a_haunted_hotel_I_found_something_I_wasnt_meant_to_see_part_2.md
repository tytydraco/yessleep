The body on the floor was mine. The same blonde hair curled down around the jaw, the same red and black plaid skirt I always wear, even the same necklace, a purple gem dangling on the bottom of a thin, short gold chain around the neck. And if I looked underneath the bloated, discolored skin and bulging, unblinking eyes with red where white should be, was my face. And my piercing blue eyes. 

I steadied my hyperventilating lungs, staring at my body in front of me. I flicked out a single finger. I had to touch it. I had to know if it was real. But my finger passed right through its, *my,* cheek. I stood, moving backwards away from my body, unwilling to break my gaze from her. From *me.* I must have backed myself all the way through the door, because the next thing I heard was a cough, the kind people make when they want to get your attention. 

I wheeled around in instinctive panic. “Howdy, ma’am.” A man stood before me, regaled in cowboy decor. Boots, chaps, hat, vest and a belt strapped around his thin waist that holstered a rusted pistol. He tipped his hat towards me, touching the brim with a couple fingers as the words spilled out of his lip-less mouth that adorned a decayed, gray face. Bits of bone shone through his cheeks, mouth, and forehead, exposed by loose bits of rotted, dangling skin. I screamed, falling to the floor. The cowboy bent and reached towards me. 

“I know, it’s quite a shock, but everything’s gonna be alright.” His husky, smooth voice echoed through the hall. I scooted farther away from him, locking my knees to my chest with my arms. He remained undeterred in his posture. “It’s been quite a while since we had a newcomer. And well, it seems it’s been determined to be my job to welcome you to our little family.” He unbent himself and gestured to the room behind him. 

For the first time, I noticed the slew of people scattered in the narrow hallway behind him. A woman wearing a Stanley housekeeping uniform holding a candle with a blue flame, a man and woman holding hands, another man adorned in a dusty apron and a long white chef’s hat, three children, two of them playing tag, the other hiding behind the legs of the chef, and a golden retriever wagging its tail. Most of them were smiling at me, and all of them had the same gray faces, rotting skin, and exposed bone. 

I recognized them all. The autistic child who plays with your hair. The children who laugh on the 4th floor. The pastry chef who haunts the old tunnels and passages. Elizabeth, the worker who folds your clothes at night. Freeland and Flora Stanley, the founders. Cassie, the dog who will scratch at your door. And the cowboy who watches you sleep. Ghosts. The famed ghosts of The Stanley. The ones I never saw and never believed were real, all standing before me. A chill ran down my spine. 

“I’m John,” the cowboy said. “That’s Elizabeth there with the candle, William, in the hat. Mary and George,” he said, gesturing to the two rambunctious children, “and Thomas being the last child. Then there’s Freeland and Flora, of course, and last, but not least, Cassie.” Each one nodded or curtsied at the mention of their name, except for the children. “We all wanted to make sure we made it here to welcome you,” John said. “Well, except for Henry, of course, seeing as how there’s a woman in 401 tonight.” Elizabeth bristled. 

A lump formed in my throat as a thousand questions flickered in and out of my mind. *Why were they here? Have they been following me? Why haven’t I seen them until now? Is that really my body behind that door? How did I die? Why did I die? How long have I been dead? Am I a ghost?* All of it was too overwhelming to understand or process. I couldn’t hold back my emotion anymore, and I cried. Tears landed on my lips, but I tasted nothing. I’m sure it was quite a picture. A woman slumped down inside a dark room filled with ghosts, bawling her eyes out not twenty feet from her own dead body. 

“There, there, love, it’ll be alright.” William had walked forward and knelt down beside me, placing his hand on my shoulder. Cold ran through my body. If I even had a body anymore. I looked up. He wanted to lock eyes with me, but I couldn’t break my attention away from his grotesque face lined with patches of skin peeling away from the bone. My hands groped for something I could use to bash into William’s face, as though I could somehow batter a ghost. I wished they would stop trying to comfort me. Comfort was nowhere to be found. Words escaped my mouth.

“Am I dead?”

“I’m afraid so, love.” 

“How?” 

“We don’t know,” Freeland said, stepping forward. “None of us were present. We were just as stunned as you to find you here. *I doubt it.* “As I’m sure you well know, despite dear Elizabeth’s best efforts, nobody has ever died here until now.” Elizabeth bristled again.

“You can’t hold that against me forever, Freeland.”

“I very well can.” Their bickering escalated. John got involved trying to break them up. Flora next, then William, who was, to his credit, trying to get them to back up to give me space. The kids were laughing. Cassie was barking. It was too much noise. Too much everything. I couldn’t breathe. Did I even need to breathe anymore? It was too much. I ran straight towards the door, passing right through William and John, then the kids, including poor Thomas, who startled. I braced myself on the door, but passed right through it.

The world outside the walls of the building was the not same world I had left there when I came in. A neon blue glow outlined every building, every stone, every blade of grass. Every source of light was brighter, even the moon. Maybe someone with a settled mind, someone who had come to terms with their life as a ghost, who knew what to expect in the night, would have found it beautiful. But for me, it only fueled my fear and confusion, and I could find no refuge. So I ran. 

I ran as fast as I could manage. At some point, I noticed my feet weren’t even hitting the pavement, but hovering above the ground. I ran downhill. I didn’t know where I’d go, but I knew I wanted to go down. Out away from the hotel, away from the campus, away from the ghosts. The guests I passed chattered away like I wasn’t even there, some of them huddling from wind that I could hear, but couldn’t feel. The distinctive sign that marks the edge of the property caught my eye. f I could just make it off the property, make it down the hill into Estes Park, maybe I could make sense of everything. 

I glanced back over my shoulder, expecting to be pursued. I was, but only by Cassie, who stared up at me with excitement in her eyes, matching my speed, ears flopping. The rest stood and watched me run, Elizabeth and Freeland still bickering, some laughing. None of them seemed to care at all that I was running away. I was past the parking lots now. Only a few feet to go. I pushed hard. Never had I been able to run this fast for this long without collapsing a lung, but I wasn’t tired at all. No burn in my legs or lungs. I felt I could run forever. The sign was within reach now. I leaned forward for the last push to the edge of the property. When I passed it, a set of stairs appeared in front of me. My feet failed to keep themselves beneath me, and I tripped and crashed to the bottom of the stairs. 

When I landed, I enjoyed a face full of carpet. I flipped onto my back and took in my surroundings. I was back at The Stanley, somehow on the top floor near the stairwell. Guests passed me without care. I couldn’t control my breathing. My thoughts spiraled. This can’t be real. A chill ran through me once more. This time, I knew what it meant. A ghost. Freeland and Flora were the first ones to find me. They glided up the stairs, legs unmoving. I already knew what they were going to tell me. I can’t leave the Stanley [Hotel.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldArchitect/comments/yv369y/thanks_for_being_here/)
