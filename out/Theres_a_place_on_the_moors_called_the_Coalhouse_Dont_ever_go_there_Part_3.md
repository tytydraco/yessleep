As we crossed the valley once more we weighed up the best way to enter the Coalhouse. Over the course of our dream visits we’d become somewhat familiar with the layout of the building and its entry points. To begin with there were the thick oak double doors of the main entrance. Round the back there lived a way in to the workers’ quarters (also double doors, though far less grand), along with a secondary service entrance. On the far side of the building, delivery access into the kitchen block was placed. One further prospect for entry was to have a go at jimmying a board off one of the few windows on the ground floor. Carly had possessed the foresight to toss a crowbar into the boot, and I now utilised this as a climbing aid, levering my knackered body up the slope while we discussed our options. The cellar entrance, along with any others that may have existed down in the valley, were all sealed and buried as far as we could make out.

  
‘The front doors will probably be the hardest to get through, but I want to make it into the ballroom as fast as possible. I want to search for real-world evidence concerning your dream with the dagger,’ said Carly. ‘The danger is we enter on the far side and the inhabitants of this place start to mess with us, then we never get to where we’re going. Let’s try the front and if there’s no luck there, we can consider our next best option.’

  
I’d have wanted to do the same if I’d been Carly, so of course I agreed to her strategy. At length we humped over the ridge and stood in the bowing bracken, facing the front of the building. We needn’t have fretted about finding a way in— the left-hand door stood a foot ajar.

  
’Might be paranoid, but I feel like the building’s inviting us in,’ I said.

  
‘If you weren’t paranoid by this stage I’d be amazed.’

  
The hinges were jarred so we crammed in through the gap. We’d prepared flashlights and turned these on now, swinging their beams around the gloomy hollows of the foyer. Fungus had begun to invade at the entrance and the whole place was rotted out. The staircase up to the first floor had collapsed completely, and partial sagging ledges were all that remained of the upper landing. No trace of glass remained over at the reception, and the counter top was so worn as to have become rounded.

  
It stank of must.

  
‘Ballroom, right there,’ I said, gesturing to the back wall with my pale cone of light. We trod carefully over the mouldy, warped boards, skirting holes in the floor and circumnavigating the ruins of the stairway. Carly paused at the rear doors and said, ‘no distractions so far.’

  
’Shhh!’ I replied, cautioning her against jinxing us.

  
The doors had kept intact though they bore missing chunks in their panels. Carly pushed one open and we filed into the ballroom. We found a desolate empty space blanketed with half an inch of dark dust. Occasional shapes hid under this dust, leaving us to guess their nature—a table leg, a fallen roof tile, a slew of rust shards where an iron chandelier had once tumbled from above. Only one chandelier remained up in the rafters, hanging lopsided by a single chain, its main band split open at the weld and decimated by shark bites of corrosion. The stage at the far end had collapsed into itself. The swing doors leading off to the kitchen had vanished, unmasking the mouth of a dilapidated passage. I shambled over to the centre of the room—to the spot where I had come upon the gory scene in my first dream—and began to brush the dust gingerly aside with my broken feet. The floor was stained black where the blood had been, though you could no longer tell what had discoloured it. I dragged my shoe along the floor above the stain, and the dust that remained in its wake, hidden in the carved grooves, spelt out the words: “Angwynne, left hand of the Bull God.” Carly came over and peered down sternly at the evidence, requested and provided.  


  
‘Any sign of the knife?’ The dagger no longer stuck out of the “d” and it didn’t appear to have fallen to one side either. We swept around the room searching for it. A guttural moan from the kitchen passage stopped us in our tracks. We both shot our beams towards the sound.

  
A man sloped out of the recesses in an antiquated chef’s outfit. His apron looked more like a dress, with a short white jacket over it that stopped at the waist. His hat stuck up like a little puff pastry. He carried an outsized wooden meat tenderiser with him, the jagged end spattered with something or someone’s blood. He himself was bleeding profusely from the mouth. How much of the carnage down his front was his own gore and how much came from elsewhere I couldn’t tell.

  
‘Gou cug ma fughan kungue ow!’ he cried, wide-eyed, in a gurgling voice. ‘yur aw ing on ih. Ah kih gou fer gish!’

  
Without translating every word I got the message—he blamed us for his missing tongue, he was pissed off and meant us harm. He bent into a springing postion and began to circle, a keen squint about his eyes, his gob drooling awful scarlet. Carly and I sidestepped this way and that, entering into a death dance with the chef while trying to get around him. His tenderiser twitched every time he imagined us making a break for it. In turn, I swung the crowbar in his direction when he veered close, but my shots lacked clout—my whole body was still rigid and aching.

  
The simple certainty that I was done for washed over me. I had survived my night terrors largely by running, yet here we physically were, facing down a corporeal apparition in the daytime—and my feet were shot. To my own surprise I lamented deep. Over the past few years, maybe more, I had come to regard myself as a bad use of oxygen, and most likely I had travelled here to die. But the thought that my fate was to be bludgeoned out of existence at the studded end of a meat tenderiser proved too cruel. I regretted every step of my life that had led me to this point. But I also knew my slaying wouldn’t be the end. My mind couldn’t help jumping to what kind of phantom I was set to become. The undead of this place appeared trapped in a loop of their own torment; might I turn into the ghoul with the pulverised face, brandishing a crowbar, harping on about my deadly sin to the next batch of Coalhouse victims?

  
Carly made a lunge to get around the tongueless chef but he swatted at her with his weapon and she was forced back. ‘Yur aw ing on ih!’ he yelled. He moved in to capitalise on her failure.  
Then there came the patter of someone barefoot running swiftly out of the passage behind our attacker. I caught a flash of a blade at the chef’s throat and a new bout of blood washed down his apron. The man dropped the tenderiser. His hands came up and hovered around this new wound. The look on his face was one of absolute bafflement. He gargled, choked and fell away to the floor.

  
I recognised Beth from a photo Carly kept in her wallet. She stood silently before us over the corpse of the cook, pallid, gaunt, with dark hollows for eyes. She carried the dagger we had been searching for—freshly glistening with the chef’s blood.  


  
‘Beth you’re alive!’ exclaimed Carly, reflexively reaching out. Beth shook her head mutely and took a step back. When she placed her foot down it was like she had stepped on a switch. The air around her seemed to change. Without warning, Beth melted out of the world and she sucked the tumbledown hall away with her. The reality about us disintegrated and was replaced by the same ballroom but in better days, shiny walnut tables dotted across the floor, all lit warmly once again by those paraffin chandeliers up in the rafters.

  
A demented laugh followed by a scream sounded out in the reception area. The doors flung apart and Beth charged into the room—a Beth stricken with terror, though showing much more life in the colour about the cheeks. She weaved chaotically through the tables.

  
‘Beth!’ cried Carly. Beth ignored her and kept making her way towards the far end of the room. A man appeared in the doorway now. He held his shoulders up skew-whiff about his ears and his face shone bright as only a maniac’s could. He gave us a repeat of the screwy laugh, then bounced after Beth. Carly shouted ‘hey!’ and hurtled for him. She performed a great diving rugby-tackle between the furniture… but the two went right through each other like a pair of holograms. The man swept on unscathed. Beth sensed him bearing down on her. She zipped to one side just before he could grab her arms, and leapt up onto the stage. He puttered to a stop at the foot of the platform and leered up at her, while she goggled fearfully down. Then, in an instant, his demeanour changed. He backed away. Tripping over a chair, he scampered off and back through the reception doors.

  
Beth turned round to find the thing that had scared him off.

  
Angwynne floated three feet above the centre mark of the stage. None of us noticed her before this exact moment. Her thick, matted ginger hair jagged out around her head like a lion’s mane. She fixed Beth with an intense gaze, the slightest of smirks about her lips. She was dreadful to behold. It was Beth’s turn to run.

  
She toppled in awkward fashion off the stage and landed hard on one foot. As she tanked back in the direction of the reception, Angwynne glid serenely through the air after her. Carly—who had flung herself almost to the opposite edge of the hall and was still in the process of crawling up at the floor—yelled: ‘you leave her be!’

  
But it was to no effect. As Beth reached the centre of the hall Angwynne looked casually up into the beams of the ceiling. An iron chain shot out like a striking viper from where her gaze had landed. It wrapped itself around Beth’s neck and lifted her a foot and a half off the floor. It began to swing her round like a dowsing pendulum. Beth struggled and choked up top, her fingers vying to get between the chain and her throat, while her flailing legs smashed into and clattered through the furniture with increasing violence. Her shoes came flying off one by one with the impacts. Carly lunged in to try and intervene but a wave of tumbling tables and chairs beat her back. I stood dumbly by, squeezing the crowbar in frustration, having already understood our inability to influence the events we witnessed.

  
Ordering the chain with another glance, Angwynne had it yank Beth dead centre, then rise high up into the room. Then the Left Hand of the Bull God rose to meet the floundering woman. She hovered inches away from Beth’s gagging face. She cocked her head, reached around the side of Beth’s jiggling torso and retrieved the sacrificial dagger from its hiding place in the suffocating woman’s belt.

  
Angwynne turned the knife over in her palm. ‘You came to plunge this into the heart of the Bull God? What nonsense. A god cannot be harmed. Nevertheless, you shall be punished for the base intention.’ With a flick of her eyes she stripped Beth’s blouse off. Now Beth dangled, purple-faced, bare feet swollen, breasts exposed.  


  
‘Leave her be!’ screamed Carly below. ‘Let her go! Take me!’

  
Angwynne placed the blade horizontally along the line directly below Beth’s left collarbone. Then she pushed inwards. Beth gurgle-moaned. The knife, still horizontal, disappeared into Beth’s chest up to the blade’s spine. The poor woman was too deprived of oxygen to give voice to her torment. Her eyes rolled into the back of her head; she began to make *gug-gug* noises in her throat. Dark blood welled out and poured down the right side of her body. Angwynne slowly drew the knife deep down behind Beth’s tit and all the way into her gut like she was carving a pig’s belly. A massive roll of meat that included Beth’s breast flopped forward off the bone, exposing a glittering ribcage. Crimson liquid sloshed. Angwynne turned to the other side of the torso and began to slash viciously in sweeping diagonal lines. Blood spattered about, raining down over the hall. Beth was nothing but a meaty doll before Angwynne stopped. Her body death-juddered. The chain released Beth and she plummeted to the floor with a wet splat. Angwynne dropped the knife. Floating backwards, she vanished into the ether.

  
We were sure Beth must be dead by now. Carly, who had been bawling up at them impotently all this time, clambered over toppled furniture towards the body.

  
But Beth’s arm shot in her direction, palm out in a halting gesture. Bewildered, Carly obeyed the command. Beth’s other arm reached out blindly and found the knife. Then she started to carve, her whole body shivering in agony, the coughs and squelches of a dying person in her throat. Carly dropped to her knees, a helpless onlooker, and wept.

  
It took Beth a good while to complete the task, all the while threshing in a pond of her own life-blood. When she was done the words “Angwynne, left hand of the Bull God” had returned to the spot where I found them. Beth raised the dagger as if to stab it into the “d” but then stopped. She looked up for the first time, directly into the eyes of Carly, and offered out the knife. Carly blundered over to Beth, shook her head and cried above the ruins of her girlfriend. Mutely, Beth glanced down at the carving, then offered the handle of the dagger to Carly once more. Carly grabbed hold of it.

  
All of a sudden the two of us were back in the dark, dust-blighted hall of the present, lit in bleak fashion only by our torches—the sole difference from before being that Carly now had the knife in her grasp. Beth and the blood-soaked nightmare were gone. Carly turned to me with a painful why? written on her features.

  
‘Beth showed you all that to get the dagger to you, to show you what must be done,’ I said.

  
‘And what must be done?’

  
I nodded at the carved letters. ‘She realised too late—she had the wrong target. This all revolves around the Left Hand of the Bull God. And whatever she is, she’s no god. We’ve got to slay Angwynne with the dagger.’

  
Carly’s features formed into hard lines. Her hand gripped the blade anew.

  
‘With pleasure.’

  
There wasn’t much time to think. We heard movement at the reception entrance and swung our torches just in time to see what looked like Beth slipping through the crack of the door. After firing each other a trepidatious glance we crept after her. We found her in the lobby on the opposite side of the collapsed staircase from the reception desk. She stood blankly in a recess, guarding what once must have been a grand-looking panelled door. Beth turned and went in, closing the door softly after her. In my dreams I’d not noticed this door, having never gone around that side of the stairs.

  
‘You ever been that way?’ I asked Carly.

  
‘Uh-uh.’

  
Behind the door was a short passage that communicated to five other rooms, two on each side and one at the end. The first doorway to our right was missing its portal; we peeked in. Fallen beams, rubble, dust and rust reigned, but by picking out details then engaging an effort of the imagination, you could fathom that the room had long ago hosted a swanky bar.

  
‘Are we in the VIP area?’ asked Carly.

  
‘Looks like.’

  
With no Beth to guide us (or bait us?) to our next step, we travelled on to the end of the corridor and shunted the rickety door open. A weird space met us. Three stone steps led down to an earth floor, which spanned a few yards before stopping at the facade of an ancient stone church, whose front carried on up through the roof.

  
A building inside a building.

  
Carly said: ‘they constructed the Coalhouse around this.’

  
‘Looks like.’

  
‘Twice and that’s already annoying.’

  
The inside proved to be a smallish chapel, majorly intact as the construction, roof to floor, was all sturdy grey stone. Everything was sheeted in dust and cobwebs. The glass elements of the stained-glass windows were at about fifty-percent capacity, though those pieces had grown opaque with grime and dulled into a uniform khaki colour. Beyond the windows the “outside” stopped a mere foot distant—at the walls of the room built around the chapel. We scuffed along the aisle, shining our lights into the recesses of the place, trying to work out if there was a reason we were here.

  
I sifted briefly through the ornaments strewn over the altar. Carly found a gilded chest at the back of the apse and lifted the lid. ‘Look at this,’ she said. She retrieved a weighty vellum scroll from within and brought it over. We sat on the step of the chancel and, pointing my beam downwards, we read:

  
*I, faether of this humble kirk, hath writan here mine hystorie, of sych terrour hwych mighte to cause a strife within thee, O thou who readst. Mine kirk aside the taverenne upone these moores ys stricken, alike the ale-hows, bye horrible visitacioun. A daemon bye the name of Angwynne hath reveylled to me yn dreame the fell storie of her life. I sette doun these words that others mighte to lerne and be awary. Angwynne, bourne of heythen times, mayhaps afore Our Lourd sette foot on erthe, was bourne of lowly posiscioun. Through evil wille and machinacioun she hyed to courte of the king and tooke playce there. Her enymies at politicks al mette with deth misteryousse, tille one day Angwynne fonde posicioun and influoens aside the King hisselfe. Soon ynogh the Cwaen was ded, victimne of a dreadfull poysone, and Angwynne Cwaen insted. Manie sortes of yll and wicked personnes flockt bye her side, untille the King hisselfe grew afeared. He hyed to our playce here yn these moores, hwere heythen temple stode then, and prayd to false gods for salvayscioun. But Angwynne afore had sette the trap. Her acolytes helde the King, hwile Angwynne mayde fell sackrifice to thowse gods. Therafter, Angwynne was Cwaen alowne, a lang reygne of tyrannie and deth.*

  
*It mighte to seme like blassfemie to speke, yet the fell treatie wrought bye Angwynne with thowse gods hath come to passe. For how mighte to this be truth, yf there be but one God? But Angwynne in deth liffes on. She tourments the goode foulk abutte these partes. Yn dreames she comes with acolytes, and for somme she walkes the erthe. She colleckts poor soules and brings them ynto Hel.*

  
*I mineselfe am afeared. Three wekes past I fonde yn the crypte of the kirk the origynale sackrifisceal stane of thowse gods of Angwynne. I lernt that one mighte to summoune her bye means of letting blod upon the stane. I plede God for valour. I wille to summoune this daemon and cast her from mine kirk. Here endeth mine tale.*

  
Carly let the scroll loose in her hands and it rolled itself back up. ‘That’s why Beth led us here.’  
‘To summon Angwynne by letting blood upon the sacrificial stone. In the crypt of this church. Where’s that then?’

  
We swept round the nave searching for a trapdoor but soon came up with nothing. A little nook hid at the back of the apse which harboured a short archway. We had to bend to get through and found ourselves in an unfurnished vestry, around eight feet square. There was nothing here. We were about to turn and exit, when one of the corner flagstones caught my eye. The cracks between this flagstone and the others were more pronounced than anywhere else in the room.

  
‘Hold on a minute.’ I brushed the dust away from the stone; once, hundreds of years ago by the worn-out nature of it, someone had frantically carved crude crosses all over its surface.

  
‘It’s here.’

  
I wedged my crowbar into the gap and, with Carly’s help, levered the stone up. We shunted it entirely out of its slot and onto the vestry floor. Below, a thin set of stone steps led into the earth. Neither of us hesitated at this point—we had committed to our doom. We trotted down the steps into the foisty underground space. It wasn’t a genuine crypt as it turned out, just an oval space, with a low roof, dark dirt floor, and grey stone walls. In the centre stood Angwynne’s sacrificial stone, dark green, almost black, pointing up like a five-foot cenotaph. Around its base sat a ring of river-smoothed rocks, and beneath them a bed of jet stones.

  
‘How much blood-letting do you reckon it’ll take?’ asked Carly.

  
‘Let’s start small, eh?’

  
We stood inactive for a moment.

  
‘Let me do it,’ I said, taking the knife from Carly. I approached the stone and readied the blade. With my right hand I slit along the palm of the left; I went deeper than intended and blood spattered into the soil. I slapped the bleeding hand against the rock.

  
It started with a low, aching vibration from within the stone, a subsonic buzz that built in intensity until it jarred through every single one of my bones. I didn’t seem to be able to take my hand away. The vibration spread through the basement, the topsoil dancing now. I wrenched my hand back at last and stumbled a couple of steps in Carly’s direction. The stone began to glow. A gooey type of light glooped up out of it, a light that somehow darkened the room around it. As it waxed in both quantity and brightness the room grew ever blacker. The goop slowly took form, then there came an abrupt flash and Angwynne stood before us.

  
‘Hello my dearies. Summoned am I?’ she said through a crooked smile. ‘Oh, at least you’ve brought the dagger. The last fellow who summoned me this way—for the same purpose mind—thought he could vanquish me by simply showing me two small bits of wood crossed together. It still makes me laugh that one.’ She let fly a cackle by way of demonstration.

  
I tried to steel myself, gripping at the knife within my sweating palm. Now she was here I had no idea how this could go our way. I’d seen her float at will and command the world around her with a glance. Could I just step forward and plunge the blade into her rotten heart?

  
It would be child’s play for her to stop me.

  
‘Come on, killer, strike,’ Angwynne said. ‘Or have you lost the stomach for it since the last time?’

  
Since the last time. She was working her way into my head. I felt my resolve slipping from me like an ill-fitting garment.

  
She continued. ‘You didn’t tell your partner here everything, did you? In the wagon you said: “Malena had a rare blood illness. It was painful and protracted. The doctors gave her eight months. She got three-and-a-half years in the end. Before…” come now Peter. Finish your sentence.’

  
I turned to Carly with tears in my eyes. All I wanted now was to confess. I stammered: ‘…before I smothered her with a pillow. I suffocated her, Carly. I just couldn’t go on. And it wasn’t because she asked me. I murdered her. By that time she was so out of it—drugged, still lost squirming in agony—that she wasn’t conscious enough to make any decision. I did it because I couldn’t bear to watch her like that anymore, because I couldn’t go on living that way. That’s why I can’t let it go, Carly. That’s why I belong down here with her.’

  
‘Whatever,’ spat Carly, striding forward and yanking the dagger from me. She faced Angwynne. ‘You don’t have any emotional hold over me you bitch!’  

  
‘I don’t need it for you,’ Angwynne replied. ‘You saw what I did to your love, the same will be arranged for you. She was just as rebellious a cow.’

  
‘Is just as rebellious a cow,’ came a voice over Angwynne’s shoulder. Beth stood behind her where there had been no one before. The next second I noticed at the other shoulder a man in a simple robe, whom I figured to be the old priest of the chapel. They each grabbed an arm of Angwynne’s and yanked it back. Angwynne growled and strained to release herself, almost succeeding at first try. I felt reverberations through the air as the three tugged; this was not just a physical battle but a match of psychic powers.

  
And Angwynne was near impossible to contain.

  
But they had her for the instant. Carly rushed forward and plunged the knife into Angwynne’s belly, who roared—in fury it seemed as much as anything. In went the knife again. Using massive force Angwynne plucked free her arms. A great strain of will, which I saw written on her face, made Beth and the priest vanish. Then Angwynne clamped onto Carly in a death-hug and squeezed. Carly plunged the knife again and again into the torso of the demon. The Left Hand of the Bull God grunted with each stab. The building around us rumbled. Blood slopped out between the two fighting women and splashed upon the sacrificial stone. Then Angwynne flitted out of reality as though she had got sucked up by a vacuum cleaner. She took Carly with her.

  
The rest is epilogue. I don’t believe Angwynne is truly vanquished but she is dealt with for the time being. Her hold over me has gone. I still count myself a scumbag who deserves an eternity under the Coalhouse, but on the other hand Angwynne is not a being that should own either my or anyone else’s soul. Did I ever really see Malena? Perhaps not. My bitterest regret now is not that I killed her, but that I inadvertently sent her to that place. I’m sad for Carly, though the feeling’s softer. Beth went to the Coalhouse in rebellion, as did the priest, and they both kept their agency down there. Those who are drawn in by anguish are the ones who lose their will and their sense of self. I guess the trauma of being murdered can work in a similar way. But Carly went down fighting, and it comforts me to think that she is reunited with Beth, and that they will pass the afterlife together. It’s what she wanted setting out.  


  
Not much is left to tell. I crawled out of the Coalhouse and drove away in Carly’s car. As I sit in my flat drafting out the final details of my account, it all starts to seem unreal. Technically most of it was a dream. But at the same time I know none of it was, and a lightless horror invades me when I consider the prospect of Angwynne and the Coalhouse coming back to claim me. It’s my duty to warn you against looking for the Coalhouse. If you’re out on the moors and you spy a long grey building, run the other way. If you visit the place in your dreams, work like hell to heal your trauma when you wake. And one last time, whatever you do, don’t you ever go there.
