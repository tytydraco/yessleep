**NSFW:** One brief, fantastical depiction of self-harm. Additionally, horror relating to the harming of a child.

*“For the love of God, man, can we get this show on the road already?”* I grumbled, pacing restlessly around the cramped office.

An older gentleman dressed in a navy blue pinstripe suit looked up from his desk. I glared at him, intent on browbeating the civil servant into expediting this appointment. He was decidedly unfazed by my attempt at intimidation, rolling a pair of bloodshot eyes at me before returning to whatever document he’d been wordlessly scribbling on for the past hour, snickering and whispering something under his breath.

*“What did you just say?”* I muttered, rage sizzling down my chest.

The man dropped his expensive-looking, quill-tipped pen and shrugged his shoulders, seemingly as frustrated as I was.

*“Listen, Tim, I’m waiting on you,”* he replied in a low, raspy voice.

I marched forward. My right foot got caught on a ripple in the Persian rug that covered the floor and I stumbled, bracing myself on the man’s desk as I fell by wrapping my fingers around its blunt edge. I retracted my hand in disgust and started shaking it. The surface was slick with something gelatinous.

He chuckled at the sight. I shoved my hand up to his face. That made him laugh even harder.

*“What the hell is on my hand?”* I barked.

*“No idea!”* He replied. The chuckle transitioned to full-on cackling. His cheeks became flushed from the elation, his breathing strained.

I began pulling my hand away, but he yanked my palm back to his face with enough force that I needed to anchor my other hand onto the desk to avoid toppling over.

*“Hold on…hold on…let me take a look,”* he said.

His cackling fizzled as he inspected the substance. He brought my palm closer. When it was an inch from his nostrils, he began cartoonishly sniffing the viscous fluid, even going so far as to dab some of it over the bridge of his nose like it was sunscreen.

*“Well, Tim, if I had to make a wager, I’d say diesel.”*

I snapped out of it and jerked my hand from his grip, lurching backwards to create some distance between me and the lunatic. I dragged both hands along my thighs, desperate to get the liquid off, but nothing seemed to smear over my chinos. I stared at my hand. Flipped it over and then back again, disbelief trickling through my veins like an IV drip.

Both palms were dry. Completely unvarnished.

*“What…what is this?”* I whispered, still gawking at my newly clean hands.

He didn’t answer me. When I looked up, the man had his head down, listlessly attending to the stack of documents on his desk, yawning as he scanned paper after paper. He’d gone from feverish cackling to utter indifference in the span of a few seconds. My brain throbbed from the whiplash.

*Why am I here?* I thought.

*“Hmm?”* the man said.

*“Why am I here?”* I repeated out loud.

*“Oh, come now Tim, you know,”* he replied, monotone and disinterested.

But…I didn’t know. Not consciously, at least. I spun around, searching for *some* reminder of my purpose in that claustrophobic office.

The entire space couldn’t have been over eight hundred square feet. Constructed in the shape of an octagon, it had doors at three, six, and nine o’clock positions, with a desk at twelve o’clock. Faint light spilled in from the sides of a small, square, shuttered window on the wall above the desk.

None of *that* helped determine where the hell I was.

I started hyperventilating.

The gentleman released an explosive sigh in response.

*“No need to fall victim to hysterics, my boy. Take a moment. You’ll realize that you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be. In the meantime, can I offer you some refreshments?”*

He slid his chair backwards and bent over, rummaging under his desk.

*“Just a little something to calm you down - something to make this all a little easier, if you know what I mean,”* he said, speech muffled but audible.

Then, I heard the rapid clinking sound of many hard pellets cascading against plastic, followed by the gurgling of water being poured into a glass. When he reappeared, the man had one arm wrapped around a massive, semi-transparent bowl of mint Tic-Tacs and a bright orange sippy-cup in his other hand.

*“Although, I wouldn’t say they’ll make this painless. Painless really isn’t the right word, even if it sounds right to you. Easier is close, but it’s also not quite right. Simple, merciful, streamlined, humane - they’re all close, too, but each one is just a bit off the mark.”*

He set the bowl and the sippy-cup onto the desk.

*“Language is funny like that, huh? So many words, and yet none of them are ever a perfect fit, not a single entry in the whole damn catalog. Aren’t we the ones who came up with the words to begin with? Thousands and thousands of years evolving, expanding, inventing, and yet, we haven’t even come up with the right words to explain ourselves and our motivations. You’d think humanity would’ve had the entire spectrum of experience completely mapped out by now. Dismal, absolutely dismal. I mean, what good is a self-driving car or an intercontinental missile system that can accurately target and obliterate something as insignificant as a gnat - from four-thousand miles away, mind you - if we haven’t even developed enough language to adequately describe why we’d want to do such a thing in the first place? It’s a little ass-backwards. We’re building lavish mansions on a foundation made of driftwood and Elmer’s glue, so to speak.”*

The man pushed both objects across the desk.

*“But, I digress. You’re not here for a sermon, right? You’re here to go home. So…do what you know you need to do. I think you’ll get out eventually, but it’s always so hard to say from the jump. People can and will surprise you, sure as the sun does rise.”*

He motioned to the door on his left, tilting his head and smirking. All three doors were identical - narrow partitions made of light pinewood with dull brass knobs - save the one he was pointing out.

That brass doorknob shone with a dark red-orange glow.

I ignored him. Instead, I balled my hand into a fist and raised it into the air.

*“Tell me where* ***the fuck*** *I am or so help me God…”* I bellowed.

The man closed his eyes and massaged his temples.

*“Alright, Tim, settle down now,”* he said with resignation.

He stood up, shambled over to the window, clasped the drawstring, and then wearily rotated his head so he could see me.

I stepped back. My fist dissolved.

*“What…what are you doing?”* I muttered.

He smiled, lips curling into an enthusiastic half-crescent.

*“Well, please correct me if I’m wrong here, but I believe that you just threatened me? In essence, I’m only reciprocating the gesture. Tit-for-tat, turnabout is fair play, et cetera, et cetera. You get the idea.”*

His eyes widened. His smile became even more animated, eventually appearing more like a painful muscle spasm than a grin.

*“Would you like to see?”* he rasped through a mouth full of grinding teeth.

Before I could protest, he gently tugged on the drawstring. The movement was so slight that it was nearly imperceptible, but that was still enough of a catalyst.

I sprinted to the door opposite the one with the glowing knob, twisted it open, and rushed through. As I ran, I heard the man say one last thing:

*“See you when I see you, Tim.”*

The door clattered shut behind me, and I was alone.

I found myself in a narrow, musty-smelling passageway lit by a single, low-powered glass bulb hanging from the ceiling. The chugging *thuds* of heavy machinery beyond the wet brick walls pounded against my eardrums.

*Where the fuck am I? What was I doing before this?*

My pace slowed to a crawl. I flicked the dangling light bulb as I passed under it.

*How did I get here? Why am I here?*

I let those questions echo around my head, undisturbed, unanswered. Dissecting them felt futile. In the end, the best course of action seemed to be the most straightforward one.

*Just escape.*

I picked up speed. My sneakers splashed in and out of puddles of what I supposed was water from leaky plumbing. Thirty or so footfalls later, I was in front of another door. Hesitantly, I grasped the knob, turned it, and slammed my shoulder against the wood, pushing it open.

My heart sank.

Another octagonal office space. Another man behind a desk, dawdling over paperwork with a window behind him. Another rug and another two doors: one straight in front of me, and one to my left. Another window that I would rather die than see behind.

It wasn’t a precise copy of the last room, and it wasn’t a precise copy of the man, but both were close.

His pinstripe suit was a little brighter, more azure than navy. The previous rug’s pattern was primarily floral; this one depicted a flock of birds flying over a snowy mountaintop. The boxes of papers beside the desk were dappled with moisture, sodden and crumpling, whereas the other ones had been bone dry.

He didn’t respond to my intrusion. Didn’t seem bothered in the least.

No, he just kept working.

I bolted past him, through the door straight ahead, and found myself in a distressingly familiar, damp hallway. At that point, I wasn’t even thinking. Not thinking anything useful or intelligible, anyway. I was simply running. Running until I found my way out or until my heart imploded in my chest, the first scenario being my ideal outcome. Truthfully, though, I would have been perfectly content with either.

The next door creaked open, and I prayed for something different. A lobby. A flight of stairs. The goddamned black pits of hell would have been preferable to another Xerox of that office.

The room I discovered was like the room before it, but with its own trivial changes.

Couldn’t tell you precisely what those changes were. I didn’t stop long enough to commit them to memory. That time, I veered left instead of straight. Heaved the door open, hoping to find something other than a dank, poorly lit hallway on the other side.

Once again, no luck.

I charged through the passage, shoes and socks becoming thick with absorbed moisture. With feet as heavy as concrete slabs, I stormed into the next room.

The man behind the desk was wearing a crimson polo and brown khakis. I heard him cheerfully whistling The Talking Heads’ *Burning Down The House* as I passed by, once again taking the left door. Then straight in the room that followed. Then straight for a few instances, followed by left for a few instances. After that, I began alternating.

Left.

Passageway.

Straight.

Passageway.

Left.

Passageway

So on and so on.

As I progressed deeper into the labyrinth, things began to change.

You see, in the first room, everything was relatively normal, with a handful of subtle peculiarities bubbling beneath the facade. Same with the second room. In fact, I’m sure rooms one through ten were all reasonably aligned with reality. That said, they were incrementally transitioning into something far worse.

Let me provide you all with an example.

In the first room, the Persian rug was floral.

In the second, it had a flock of birds on it.

In the fortieth, a pelt made from my mother’s flayed skin replaced the rug. Her head was still attached, facing me as I entered the room. Two dead eyes tracked me as I ran, a pool of spittle forming around her gaping mouth, putrid saliva streaming over her pus-stained gums.

How about another example? Why not, right?

In a later room, the man was bare-ass naked and covered in thousands of self-inflicted paper cuts from the documents scattered over the desk. Each laceration had become a separate mouth, with the inflamed edges acting as lips. He didn’t say a word, but his legion of injuries whispered to me.

The rule of threes is narrative gospel, so allow me to provide a third and final example.

In the room where I finally stopped to catch my breath, a hundred or so abstractions later, the desk and the rug were gone entirely. The man was lying face down on the barren floor, with lines of termites crawling in and out of what appeared to be a bullet hole in his head. That time, he wasn’t wearing a suit, but he wasn’t naked either. He was covered in sheets of paper from his ankles to his collarbones instead. The language on the documents looked like a bastard child of Mandarin and Braille.

I slumped to the floor, defeated, weeping as I leaned my broken body against the wall. At first, I collapsed in the area furthest from the man and his infestation. After a moment, though, I realized that put me only a few feet away from the shuttered window.

In comparison, it was worse.

I scrambled across the room on all fours, squashing several insects in my wake. When I got as far as I could away from the window, I shifted myself towards the wall, and I laid down. Eventually, the tears stopped flowing. I closed my eyes, and I waited for sleep to take me away.

I waited, and I waited, and I waited.

Minutes turned to hours.

Hours turned to days.

Nothing. My consciousness would not quiet.

Sleep had abandoned me.

*“Am I dead?”* I whispered, still facing the wall, not expecting a response.

I heard a rustling across the room. Then, the soft tapping of feet against the floor. The sound kept getting louder. He was approaching me from behind. I felt the vibrations of his footsteps.

The tapping stopped. He bent down, and the floorboards whined. Termites sprinkled over me like raindrops.

I felt his lips touch the tip of my ear as he spoke.

*“Oh, Tim, no, you’re not dead. I mean, think about what you’ve done. Consider the magnitude of your depravity. The profound extent of your sordid nature. Do you really think you’ve earned the luxury of death?*

I didn’t dare look. I stayed still. Pretended I was dead. Figured I’d pretend until it finally came true.

That said, deep down, I knew he was right.

I was exactly where I deserved to be.

\- - - - - 

Years seemed to pass by.

I didn’t eat. I didn’t sleep, and I didn’t dream - thus, I didn’t abide by the old gods I was used to servicing, like hunger and exhaustion. No, I’d discovered new gods, new masters with new demands that I was beholden to, and at the precipice of that divine pantheon was The Cycle. In retrospect, it’s all nonsense - simply a way for me to cope with the circumstances.

Still, it’s the truth of how I thought back then. No reason to sugarcoat it now, I suppose.

The Cycle had three steps.

First, I would search.

The man in the original office hinted at the only way out: through the door with the glowing knob. I had to backtrack and find it.

The problem was I did not know *how* to backtrack. I’d gotten myself hopelessly lost, and I couldn’t figure how to orient myself to the labyrinth. Initially, I assumed I would eventually find the original office if I just kept moving. There could only be so many rooms, right? I was going to get lucky at *some* point.

Thousands upon thousands of rooms and passageways later, I came to terms with the fact that the labyrinth was infinite.

This thought, or something equally nihilistic, would send me spiraling into the darkest depths of apathy, which brings me to step two.

After the search broke me, I’d become dormant.

I’d curl up in a ball, close my eyes, and pray for sleep. Then I’d pray for death. Then I’d review the events of that first encounter - the slick grease on my fingertips, the TicTacs, the glowing knob - all of it. That review was usually enough to plunge me into a state of pure self-hatred.

*Why did I run from him? Why didn’t I just* ***listen?*** *What the fuck is wrong with me?*

That would last for what felt like a few days. Eventually, though, the Cycle would become agitated with my dormancy, so it would send *him* to find me.

His approach was demarcated by a sound and a scent. He sounded like a car crash combined with a horse dying during labor, screeching metal overlaid with inhuman wails of pain and the soggy splashing of childbirth. His scent, in comparison, is much easier to describe.

He smelled of a crackling fire.

I don’t know what he looks like. I never stuck around long enough to see. There was no lead-up or warning to his arrival. One minute, I’d be alone with my thoughts, and the next, he’d be careening down a nearby passageway. Untenable panic would break my dormancy, and then I’d be on to the third and final step.

I’d spring to my feet, and I’d run.

I wouldn’t be searching for anything. I wouldn’t be looking for answers or an escape, either.

I’d just be trying to get away from *him*.

The twisting of metal and the smell of burning wood would get fainter, and fainter, and fainter. When it disappeared completely, I’d know in my heart that the Cycle was pleased, but not sated.

Naturally, that meant I was required to begin again.

From there, I’d come up with a new way to search for an exit, and the Cycle would continue.

I tried mental maps. I attempted to find meaningful patterns in the office layouts, eyes pressed against the fabric of various Persian rugs, scanning for symbols that could be interpreted as arrows meant to point me in the right direction. I beat the shit out of a fair number of office-men, screaming and crying and begging them to just tell me what to do.

They’d smile at me, and when they became bored with the outburst, they’d reach to open the window blinds, and I’d run away.

Each time they threatened to show me what was behind it, though, I’d stay for just a *little* longer. I’d bolt from the room a *little* slower.

That’s when I began to smell something in the air. Not the scent of a raging fire. No, it was the step before that. The odor was more acrid. More chemical in nature. It stung my nostrils, and I knew there was truth lurking behind it. Something genuinely evil was grafted onto its carbon.

Diesel.

The smell of gasoline offered to act as my North Star, and I let it guide me home.

\- - - - - 

*“Timothy! Gracious me, how long has it been?”* the man in the navy-blue pinstripe suit chirped, eyes fixed to his desk.

I surveyed the office. A cocktail of boundless relief and unimaginable panic swept through my bloodstream. It was all there.

The man. The sippy-cup and the bowl of TicTacs. The boxes of documents.

The glowing brass doorknob.

I raced across the rug to the opposite side of the room. My hand shot out to grasp the handle.

*“I’m not sure you’re ready to do that…”* he cooed, still not looking up from his work.

I didn’t listen. My palm folded around the knob.

Searing agony erupted across my hand.

The smell of burning skin permeated the room. I screamed and tried to pull it away. Strips of charcoaled flesh remained glued to the metal. Tatters of what used to be my palm elongated like melted cheese as I continued to pull back until they snapped. For a second, I nearly smiled. Pain, true physical pain, had become a precious novelty after my years in the labyrinth.

*“Timothy, for the love of God, quit your caterwauling. I can tell you’re finally ready,”* he shouted, standing up and spinning his chair around to face the window.

The agony died down. My scream petered out into a low whimper. I brought what I assumed to be the ruins of my palm into view.

It was unharmed, though it was slick.

I couldn’t smell blackened flesh anymore.

I could smell only gasoline.

*“Take a seat. Settle. Get comfy. I’ll give you some privacy. Have a peek behind the curtain, and then you should be good to go. No hard feelings about all this, I hope.”*

I looked away from my hand, and the man was gone. He hadn’t disappeared through one of the passageways. He simply vanished from sight.

My walk to the chair was slow and methodical. A march to the gallows at daybreak. Even though I was in some sort of hell and had been for what seemed like an eternity, I took my time. I savored the moment.

I sat down, leaned back, and tugged on the drawstring, removing the blinds.

\- - - - - 

I recognized the kitchen on the other side.

It was mine, and I was there, standing over the sink.

I looked nervous. My hands were trembling as I unscrewed the lid of an orange sippy-cup.

The doorbell rang. I called out to whoever was there.

*“One second!”*

Quickly, I grabbed a pill bottle from my pocket, poured a few tablets onto the counter, and began crushing them with the handle of a kitchen knife. I lowered the open sippy-cup to the rim of the sink and scooped the fine white powder into the liquid. The doorbell chimed again. I threw the lid back on, slammed the cup onto the counter, and ran into the other room.

A minute later, I paced into the kitchen with a young woman in tow. I was rushing around and giving her directions.

*“FYI - Owen has an ear infection. I’ll make sure he gets his juice before I leave. It’s got cold-and-flu medicine in it, so don’t be surprised if he’s out like a light. There’s money for pizza in the foyer. I should be back by eleven. Oh, also, Meghan - I know you smoke. I’m not going to narc on you to your parents, but if you need to take a drag, please do it outside. Away from the house but not too far either. Got it?”*

I blinked. When my eyes opened, the scene had changed. The room had changed, too. Now, there was the side of my secluded farmhouse in the dead of night through the window, and I was looking at it from a first-person point of view. I knew that point of view was my own.

A dull red canister dripped a tiny puddle of gasoline against the wood paneling.

I lit a cigarette, but I didn’t smoke it.

My hands weren’t shaking anymore.

I dropped the ember onto the diesel, turned around, and I walked away.

*“God, Owen, I…I’m so sorry...I…I just…I just wasn’t strong enough to choose you…”* I whispered, but not in the memory that was replaying through the window.

I whispered the confession alone in the office.

One box of documents spontaneously toppled over. Papers leaked onto the floor and glided towards my feet.

I picked one up and flipped it over.

The language was no longer unintelligible. Words like *“Policy Holder”* and *“Death Benefits”* practically leapt from the page. The door with the glowing knob creaked open. As it did, I heard *him*. The sounds of shrieking steel and a ruinous childbirth seemed to shake the office walls.

I wasn’t afraid.

I did not run.

I stepped into the passageway and closed the door behind me.

\- - - - - 

My eyes gradually opened. As my vision adjusted, I heard an older man’s voice. His speech was garbled at first, but it eventually became clear.

*“…and that’s unfortunately a difficult problem to remedy. Our prison system is wildly inefficient. We’re running out of available space to house felons. Not only that, but it’s expensive as all get out, and the recidivism rate remains unacceptably high. So, to be clear, what we’re doing isn’t working, and it’s costing us a fortune.”*

I was on a cold metal slab in a sterile white room being observed by an array of well-dressed people behind a glass window. The older man seemed to be the only person who was actually in the room with me.

*“Take Timothy here, for example. This absolute devil was handed a life sentence for a double homicide. Believe or not, the details of his crime may be worse than what you’re currently imagining. Two months ago, he killed his three-year-old son to claim the insurance money on his house and his only child. Needed to settle a gambling debt, apparently.”*

The back of my head began to throb.

*“Oh, but it gets worse, folks - he also burned a young woman alive, the same one he was planning to frame for the death of his son, as it would happen. Left evidence at the scene to imply it the house fire was downstream of the girl’s nicotine addiction. The detection of an accelerant suggested otherwise. His defense argued he had been kind enough to sedate his son beforehand. That poor young woman didn’t receive the same kindness, unfortunately. During sentencing, he claimed he couldn’t handle the pressure of parenthood alone. Through bouts of crocodile tears, he claimed he was saving Owen from a life of pain and misery, trapped alone with his deadbeat of a father, given that his mother had been dead for some time.”*

I attempted to speak, but I couldn’t force any words to spill over my cracked lips.

*“Enough of the gory details, though. What’s the point? Well, Timothy agreed to take part in a controversial new study, and the terms were as follows: we can’t guarantee your safety, nor your sanity, but if you survive, you won’t serve a life sentence: you’ll be released in less than a week. Of course, we didn’t mention that it would* ***feel*** *like he lived through sixty life sentences, as opposed to one. You must be thinking: this sounds like cutting-edge technology, must cost an arm and a leg!”*

The throbbing in my head intensified.

*“Sure, it’s new, and undeniably expensive, but think of it this way - in order to enact his punishment, we only needed this small space for seven short days, as opposed to a cell for the remainder of his life, however long that’d end up being. The initial overhead may be high, but the long-term savings could be truly incredible. Not only that, but we subject our volunteer prisoners to a specialized neurotechnical module while they serve their sentence, which has shown to decrease re-offences from a projected 45% to around 2%.”*

Sensation crept back into my muscles. I fought against my restraints. The man finally looked away from the audience and down towards me.

Even without the suit, I’d recognize his face anywhere.

*“Timothy, please do settle. You’ve made it! No need to throw a fit. There’s only one additional piece of your terms to fulfill, and it’s a cakewalk in comparison. I need you to detail what you experienced during your one-thousand, four-hundred, and ninety-two-year stay inside our machine: an advertisement we can disseminate to the masses prophylactically, given our punishment will hopefully soon become an industry standard, and thus, involuntary. Something that says ‘pay your taxes, or this may happen to you’, but something that also has a certain plausible deniability. In other words, don’t submit your report to the Post for publication.”*

*“Do you think you still have the capability to do that for me, Tim?”*

I nodded.
