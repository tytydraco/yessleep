The box turned up on a Thursday.

No knock. No delivery van. Just… there. Sitting quietly on the front step like it had always been there, or like it had been waiting long before this house even existed.

It was black. Seamless. Matte. No tape, no logo, no crease to suggest it had ever been opened or closed. Claire picked it up first. I remember how her hands hesitated, just slightly, like she didn’t want to touch it at all.

It was heavier than it should’ve been. Not just physically—something about it dragged the moment down. Made the kitchen lights feel dimmer. Made the air feel… stale.

There was a folded card tucked just beneath the bottom of the cube. No handwriting on the front. Inside, five words:

***“One wish. No take-backs.”***

I laughed. Claire didn’t.

*“You think it’s cursed?”* I asked, trying to keep it light.

She forced a grin and said, *“What are you gonna wish for? A million dollars? A flamethrower?”*

*“I’ve already got everything I need,”* I said, looking at her like an idiot in a perfume ad.

She rolled her eyes and left it on the counter.

••

We ignored it until Saturday.

Hangover dragging me down. The room still smelled faintly of burnt toast and the old garlic bread we forgot in the oven. Claire opened the box. I just watched.

Inside: a single red button, sunk into black velvet. It looked plastic, cheap, like something off a game show set. But even from where I stood, I could tell it didn’t belong. It hummed without sound. It felt… patient.

Claire ran her thumb around the edge of the velvet and stopped.

*“If you could wish for anything,”* I said, *“what would it be?”*

She didn’t even blink. *“To never lose this.”*

So I pressed it.

••

It made a small click. That was it. No lights. No spark. No trembling floor.

*Just a click.*

We laughed. We made pancakes. The world continued spinning, but I swear something behind it… tilted.

••

The crash happened on Monday.

Wet roads. A jackknifed lorry. Her car folded in half. The pictures didn’t look like wreckage—they looked like something that had been chewed.

They told me it was quick. No pain.

But when I saw her body, I knew they were lying. Some expressions don’t leave a face even after death. Hers still held fear. And surprise.

••

I went home that night and sat in the dark.

I couldn’t cry. It wasn’t grief. It was something deeper—something bottomless. The kind of silence that feels like it’s waiting for you to scream.

Then the stairs creaked.

*Just once.*

Third step from the bottom. The one that always whined when Claire walked barefoot in the mornings.

*I held my breath.*

And then I heard it again.

••

She was in the kitchen. On the floor.

Laid out like a doll someone had forgotten to pose properly. Her limbs were twisted wrong, one leg folded underneath her hip, an arm pinned under her back. Her clothes were soaked. Her face slack.

Her eyes were open.

She didn’t move. Not while I stood there.

But when I turned to leave the room and looked back—she was sitting up.

Not breathing. Not blinking.

*Just watching me.*

••

She never moved when I watched. Not once.

But every time I turned a corner, left a room, closed my eyes—I’d find her somewhere else. Upright. Unblinking. Always staring.

She’d be in the hallway. At the edge of the bed. At the bottom of the stairs. One time, sitting on the kitchen counter like she’d just climbed up there.

Her body still broken. Her skin beginning to dry and crack.

Her expression never changed.

Not sad. Not angry.

*Just watching.*

••

I tried to bury her again.

I drove two hours into the countryside and dug until my hands bled. The ground felt wrong—too soft, too eager. When I left, I thought it was over.

She was back that night.

On the couch. Folded into the same impossible shape.

I didn’t even check the front door. I knew it hadn’t opened.

••

Each day she decayed more. Skin like paper. Eyes dulling. Teeth exposed now where her lips had dried and curled back. But she still turned up. Still moved when I didn’t see.

I stopped sleeping. Stopped eating. I couldn’t take my eyes off her for more than a few seconds.

Because she’d be closer.

••

One morning, I found her standing at the foot of the bed. Same position. Same stare.

I pulled the box from the trash and begged. Screamed at it. Slammed it against the wall until the casing cracked and something inside buzzed like an insect trapped in resin.

Nothing changed.

The note was still true.

***One wish. No take-backs.***

••

Last night, I woke up to her on the floor, right next to the bed.

Inches from my face.

One arm bent wrong beneath her. One leg twisted like a broken puppet. Her head turned toward me, resting on her shoulder at an angle a human neck should never reach.

Her skin was the color of parchment. Her eyes were dull marbles sunk too deep in her face. Her lips had split, and blood had dried across her chin like black paint.

And she didn’t move.

I watched her for what felt like hours. Long enough for the sun to begin hinting at the horizon.

*And she never blinked.*

••

I know what I wished for. I see that now.

I didn’t wish for money or fame or power.

I wished to keep something.

And I got exactly what I asked for.

What remains is not Claire.

*Not anymore.*

It’s just the shape of her.

The memory of her body.

A constant, rotting echo of what I refused to let go.

She’s still here.

And she always will be.

Because I couldn’t bear to lose her.

***And now I never will.***
