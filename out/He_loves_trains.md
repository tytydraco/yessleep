His name is Charlie, we met the summer of my eighth grade year of middle school. He moved into the house next door that once belonged to the McFarlands. 

Charlie was an awkward kid with round glasses and buckteeth. He had sandy, blonde hair and was rather skinny. 

My parents decided that we should knock on his families door and introduce ourselves a few days after the settled down. 

His mom was a beautiful blonde lady. She looked as if Wendy Peffercorn aged into a mother but still could hold the attention of a boy. Her name was Sally.

His dad was starting to bald and a bit bulky sized. He wore square framed glasses and had a very polite approach to him. Every memory I seen of him was that he usually was wearing dress pants and a button up shirt to match. His name was Randal, or Randy as he wished to be called. I usually called him Mr. Wilks

They opened the door when Dad knocked and he immediately shook hands with all of us. Charlie came up behind him and seen me holding my baseball glove and ball. I asked if he wanted to play catch in the yard.

His dad politely but firmly instructed us, “please don’t throw anywhere near that car.”

He pointed at a well taken care of, 1967 Ford Mustang. “Named her after my wife.” 

Me and Charlie spent the next few weeks playing catch daily and getting to know about one another. He made one thing clear to me, he loved trains. 

He showed me his room one day and it was filled with model trains. He could tell me the details and names of parts, how they worked, and everything that might would bore a teenage boy. 

One day after playing video games at my asked, he asked a very innocent question. “What do you want to be when you grow up.” 

I took a sip from my coke can and thought a second. “I’d like to be a pro baseball player. Dad says I’m the best first baseman he’s ever seen.”

“I want to be a train.”

“You mean a train conductor?”

“Hmm? Yeah, something like that.”

I told him about a hill near the house where we could ride our bikes too and be able to watch trains pass through where the tracks lay. He immediately followed me there.

We’d sit there most evenings and talk and watch as a train would pass through. Until Steve approached us.

Steve was a hobo who approached us and asked if we had any money. I didn’t but offered to bring him some food whenever I’d visit again. It would be easy to get some soup cans from the cupboard and I figured mom and dad would think it awfully kind of me to help out a man in need. 

The next day when we went , Steve was waiting for us. We gave him some snacks and goods. He began to tell Charlie stories of him hopping trains and all the things he seen. 

The next few days I would go knock at his families door and his mom would tell me that he took off on his bike already. I’d go up there and he was hanging out with Steve. It began creeping me out. 

The last time I rode up there and seen them talking, Steve began to walk down the hill to his little camp he had setup in the woods.

I hollered his name out and waved my hand. He looked back and I swore his eyes were pitch black. A smell traced through the wind to us and it smelled like rotting eggs. A cold shiver went down my back. 

“Steve said he could help me out.”  Charlie stared out at the tracks without looking at me.

“Help with what?”

“My dream.”

“Your dream?” Fear crept through me. 

“Yes.” 

“What dream is that exactly? Becoming a train conductor? You got to go to school for that, I’m pretty sure.”

“Let’s go ride back home.” 

“I don’t think we should come here anymore. Our parents probably don’t want us hanging out with Steve all the time.”

“Don’t you stop me.” For the first time, I heard anger in his voice. 

“Charlie, I think-“ 

He pushed me and yelled, “DONT STOP ME!”

We rode home in silence. I told my parents the truth and watched as mom pulled out her phone and called Sandy. 

The next few days I would look out my window and see that Charlie was never outside. I wasn’t in much trouble, but I heard Randy told Charlie that he wasn’t allowed to leave the house for a week and would have to apologize for pushing me. 

We got home from Blockbuster one evening and me and Dad had big plans to watch some action movies and play some sports games on my PlayStation 2. He grabbed popcorn and Ice cream from the grocery store. 

We noticed our neighbors door was wide open.  It looked like a leg was hanging out the door. Dad walked over to their porch and I immediately followed.

“Oh my God, call the police!” He yelled as he tried to push me out of the way, not before I seen what happened.   Randal and Sandy were dead on the ground. They were soaked in blood. My mom let out a scream that I’ll never forget. Dad ran into the house to see if Charlie was there. Mom was pulling out her phone.

I had a gut feeling, I hopped on my bike and drove to the hill. I just knew Charlie did this. Mom screamed for me to stop, I yelled back 

“Tell them to go by our hangout!” I peddled as quick as my legs would let me.

I ran down the hill and seen Charlie standing on the train tracks. I walked up behind him.he held a blood soaked kitchen knife in his hand.

“What did you do?”

“I held up my end of the deal.”

“Drop the knife and talk to me.”  He dropped it.

“Charlie, the cops are on their way.”

“The transformation will be done by then”

“Transformation, you aren’t making sense. Charlie-“ I grabbed his shoulder and screamed.

He turned around and his eyes were bright lights that were blinding to me, as if they were a train light. Steam was coming out of his ears and he opened his mouth and his scream was just like a train whistle. My eardrums felt like they could explode.

He grabbed my shoulders and knocked me down to my back. The train whistle scream kept pouring out between his laughs. The only time I could hardly see was when he was blinking. My hands desperately were reaching to find something. I grasped onto a rock and hit him in the head with it. 

I managed to stand up and sprint back up the hill while he laid there still. I ran into the headlights where my mom caught me as I fell. 

Cops sprinted down to the tracks and I explained to one what happened. 

A few days go by and all the news reporters camping outside of our house were waiting for us. My story wasn’t believable by no means to them. They did go with “kid kills parents and runs off with a homeless man.”

Some time goes by and I managed to ride to the track. I heard a whistle and seen as a train was slowly moving along. I walked down the woods line and hid behind a tree. The front of the train had features that looked similar to the face of Charlie. The conductor was Steve. He lifted his hat and winked at me. His eyes were black and little horns poked out the top of his head. 

The police made their statement and it gets brought up every year. The boy who killed his parents was never found. But he passes through our town every so often.
