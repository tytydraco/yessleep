Hello, my name is Clyde, rather normal by your standards but I deal with a lot of weird names in this field, speaking of which, I should talk about my line of work, I am employed at the NSSF, or the National Supernatural Security Foundation and today I've started this online diary!

After my introduction, from here on out I will detail my exploits throughout the foundation, I haven't worked here very long, only 2 years, I got recruited into this by a man I met named ALWAYS, I'm pretty sure it's an alias given he's not only a higher up but the head of my development branch, speaking of! The branch I work in is focused on technological advancements concerning supernatural abilities and such. Well I have lunch with a colleague in just a few minutes, I hope a few of you guys read while I'm busy!

I've been sick since a few hours after the lunch I had yesterday, but that could definitely be a result of a new enhancement drug they tested on me. afterwards I had started seeing glowing dots in my peripherals sure it will be fine though, I have faith in my co-workers!

The glowing has grown, I'm seeing bright blue circles around everything I focus my vsion on, it's been gettgin harder to see, I'm on paid leave but they do still montior me, Geo (the head of the vaccines deptarment) checks up on me once every 3 days, he's pretty nice, he asks how my days have been going and if I've talked to my family or friends, for those wondering this organization is pretty massive, so I live on-site, it's a pretty spacious apartment with nice neighbors, there's even some non-employed residence! I live right next door to this old lady who I've had tea and played chess, checkers, or word games with her! She is very sweet and someone I'd consider a dear friend. I'm scheduled to have dinner with her next week. I'll write another entry around then, thanks for the support you guys!

Hello guys. Sadly she hasn't responded to my messages, I assume she's had something come up, I'll knock on her door tomorrow. As for my vision I can see better now but weird feelings have started coursing through me, whenever I look at myself whether it be in the mirror or at my hands it feels as if every atom in my body is rapidly shaking, it makes me extremely uncomfortable, due to that I have avoided any reflections and haven't looked down too much but to write this entry, on that note, I am ending this entry, thank you all for reading.

Everything's going up in flames. I'm running from the building right now. I won't get very far though. my limbs all hurt. I don't know where to go. Oh God. Blood is staining the concrete. There is puddles of human flesh everywhere. 

12:56 PM

I'm not using TTS anymore, Carla, who was my neighbor has been screaming for the past few minutes, I'm gathering my valuables, I need to get out of here.

1:14 PM

Corpses are lining the halls, so many different brutal deaths, some are even stitched to the walls, some have caved in skulls, I'm lucky to have survived so long,  my neighbor had her own leg shoved through her chest I want to cry, it smells of both sulfur and gunpowder, I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN DOING THIS ALL, please God save me from this hell. 

2:39 PM

I see what looks like a portal, I'm about to make a run for it, I hear loud banging on the door and screams to let them in.


It's been a few minutes, the screams stop but something wet thumped on the door, it's almost here, I need to go, my vision is going blue again, I need to get out before I end up like them.

?:?? ??
*text to speech on*
Oh God my fucking eyes, they're melting, this was my worst mistake, I need to die, I need to fucking kill myself, there's a rock I'll scrape my damn eyes out, if it still hurts I'll bash my skull in, I can't let it do this any longer


NO DONT COME CLOSER PLEASE, PLEASE, HELP, HEL-
