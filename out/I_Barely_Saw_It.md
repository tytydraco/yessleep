But luckily, *very* luckily, I saw it. I was taking a walk down a old railroad that was near my house, to get my mind off my dads passing. It happened 3 days ago and I was still grieving, so I decided to take a walk, a silent and lonely walk.

 I still had my mind on the incident because I could remember it as clear as day. In the car with him, it was a Saturday and me and him always go mini golfing, we were passing by a kids lemonade stand and then it happened. His car got T-Boned and EMS couldn't get there quick enough.

 I can remember even though how much she hated him, mom was there. She couldn't stand me as much as she couldn't stand him, but one way or another, she was there. Thinking back maybe she's the reason I'm at this point. If she didn't ever get with Jared, my dad wouldn't have had to go through this.

 It was originally Fridays me and him went out but he had to change that because my *mom* had to choose joint custody, even though she hates me. He gets me on weekends and she gets me weekdays. Though it did only work out cause my birthday was on that Saturday and so he was going to bring me to his favorite ice cream parlor.

But, then it happened, I saw it, out of the corner of my eye was a tree and right behind the tree was ***it.*** I call it an it because you cant even tell if its a he or she. It was on all fours but I could only see its two front legs, and its shallow eyes. God they were the deepest pits I've ever seen, seeing it gave me an overwhelming sense of fear. God I just remember it sprinting towards me. I started running, running as fast as I could, I was top in track and field and yet every step I heard it get closer. I saw a path so I took it and found a cabin, no-one was in it so I busted through the door using my momentum and ran inside. 

It must have been really bulky cause it took it I'd say 30 seconds to get through the door. **30 seconds**, Though it was just enough time for me to hide it felt if it had been only 10 or maybe 5 seconds, I ended up choosing a cupboard to hide in. I heard it get inside and while I'm inside, I can hear it scurrying around looking for me, seconds felt like minutes, minutes felt like hours, and hours felt like days.

 I finally heard it leave. I've tried calling the cops but its just been static and I can't hear anything. The one time I did get through they sat through my story and then said something unintelligible, like a shamble of words. I haven't seen anything from the faint light I have in here. It feels warmer in here and I'm starting to sweat. it's getting really hot then,. I get a call on my phone. It reads "Dad" 10 messages pop up, "Nicky?" being nine and the last message sent chills down my spine. It read "Look Behind You." then I saw it, I saw its shadow on my arm.
