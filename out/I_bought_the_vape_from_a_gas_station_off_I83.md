You know, one of those places that feels like it exists outside time, fluorescent lights flickering, grimy tiles yellowed by cigarette smoke and regret. I wasn’t trying to quit smoking or anything noble like that. I just liked the idea of blowing big clouds and maybe not stinking like an ashtray.

It was behind the counter in a glass case, sitting alone like a misfit. Matte black, fat as a roll of quarters, no brand name, just a little sticker on the side of a skull with a third eye.

“That one?” the cashier asked, pausing as he rang me up. He looked like he hadn’t slept since the Obama administration. His eyes were red, twitchy. “You sure you want that?”

I shrugged. “Why? Battery explode or something?”

He opened his mouth like he wanted to say something else, then closed it and scanned the barcode. “You’ll see,” he muttered, almost too quiet to hear.

First hit was insane. Smooth, cold, minty but sweet too. Not like fruit or candy. More like blood in your mouth when you bite your cheek. Familiar and wrong. I held the vapor for a second, then exhaled a thick cloud that hung in the air longer than it should have, swirling in weird patterns.

For a second, the gas station lights flickered harder, and the radio, some crappy country song, slowed down, like the DJ dropped the record in molasses. I laughed nervously but shook it off. Maybe I was more tired than I thought.

By the time I got home, my chest ached. Not in my lungs though, deeper, like something buzzing behind my sternum, trying to dig its way out. I told myself it was just anxiety or maybe that gas station chicken sandwich turning on me.

I sat on the couch and took another drag. Bigger this time. I Let it sit in my lungs until my vision fuzzed around the edges. That’s when I saw him.

The hallway light was off, but the shape at the end was solid. A man. Too tall. Too still. My brain tried to tell me it was just a coat rack or a shadow, but I knew better. He didn’t move like a shadow. He twitched, glitching forward in little bursts like someone tapping pause and play on a VHS tape.

His face wasn’t right. Too many teeth in the wrong places. No eyes, just two deep, dark bruises, like the sockets were hollowed out and filled with something wet. He was watching me. I felt it like static crawling up my spine.

I dropped the vape. It hit the coffee table and kept hissing, releasing thin curls of vapor that spread across the floor like fog in a bad dream.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t speak. I just ran. Ran and grabbed my keys while bolting out the door barefoot. I slept in my car that night, parked two blocks away, doors locked, hoodie pulled tight. 

The next morning, everything looked normal. Apartment untouched. Hallway empty, but the air felt wrong. Heavy, like walking through someone else’s nightmare.

I haven’t hit the vape since. Haven’t even touched it. But I didn’t throw it away, either. It’s still on my coffee table. Right where I left it. Sometimes, in the dead middle of the night, I’ll catch that sweet, minty scent floating from the living room, even though the vape hasn’t been charged in weeks.

And sometimes I’ll wake up with my chest buzzing again, deeper now, like something small and patient has moved in.

I know I should get rid of it. Burn it, smash it, bury it. But sometimes, against all reason, I just want one more drag.

Just one.
