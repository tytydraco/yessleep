Hollywood North.

That’s what Vancouver has always been known as. The city that never plays itself.

I’ll never forget in my first semester at film school, when someone showed me the YouTube video of every American film shot in Vancouver. There were all the obvious ones: *Mission Impossible, X-Men, Star Trek*, but there were also countless horrors.

*Cabin in the Woods, It, Lake Placid, Slither, Child’s Play*, *Final Destination (like all five), Hellraiser, The Fog,* hell, they even shot *Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan* here.

And I always understood why. It's overcast. It's gloomy. It can constantly feel like something bad is about to happen. It's as if all those films, TV shows, and stories have over time created an energy.

And you gotta be careful, because if you wander in the wrong direction, especially by yourself, you’re gonna get caught up in that energy.

For me it was in those woods. Those deep northern woods, just an hour away from downtown, where I saw something I could never unsee.

I mean, I’ve been working hard to unsee it. I’ve been trying very diligently to brush it away.

But it may be too burnt in.

Still, I gotta pretend it's not there. There’s no way I can feel this scared for the rest of my life, right? Time heals wounds and all that.

For now, all I can do is keep pretending like I always have.

Pretending is what I’m good at.

Pretending is all I’ve got.

The large, brightly painted sign of “Bridge Studios” greeted me outside my delivery truck. They must give the sign a fresh coat of paint at least once a year because I've never seen it faded. Never even seen so much as a stray leaf on it.

Of course, today of all days, a crow landed on the sign and promptly defecated. I leaned out to watch it caw for a bit. It’s like it was laughing at its own vandalism.

The security guard lifted the front gate to allow me inside. Delivering parcels to Bridge Studios is about as close as I get to working in the film industry these days. And that's fine with me.

Every time I visit, the same conversation briefly flutters through my head. *This was once you, but now it's not you, and that's okay.*

I park outside the cargo bay door, and rummage through the back of my truck. All I see are large boxes, but with a simple lift and a wiggle, I can discern between tripods, sliders, and lights.

I like removing them, it's always fun. A distracting little game of reverse Tetris.

Inevitably, there is always one person who recognizes me at the lot. I did work at Bridge Studios for over two years across multiple shows. They always say the same thing.

”So good to see you!”

“How have you been?”

“When are you coming back?”

My answer is always:

“You too.”

“I’m fine.”

“Not coming back anytime soon.”

It's always too complicated to explain further. It's a scab I have no interest in tearing off. So I just keep it short and say the hours weren’t for me, I wanted to try something else.

I mean, sure I’ve *tried* to return to the big shows (I was less than 200 hours away from joining the union after all) but even still, I couldn't continue.

Unfortunately, almost anything to do with the film industry: cameras, clapboards, and walkies illuminate that black spot in the back of my head. That black spot I’ve been working hard to bury, and pretend it doesn’t exist.

So I just stopped setting foot on a set again. No more movies for me.

Am I going to elaborate? Nope.

Am I preventing myself from seeking closure? Probably.

At least that's what my short-lived therapist said, but honestly, I've chosen this path, and it has served me fine. There are some things you are allowed to close off and move on from. And I have.

I lifted all the weighty packages off my truck and onto a pallet outside. After ringing the buzzer, someone I didn't recognize came out and gave me the thumbs up.

My job here was done.

Delivering in an industrial neighborhood is always nice because there's a lot less traffic, and plenty of parking. It's the small things that can make a day pleasant.

For instance, I've been listening to music podcasts lately. Specifically ones that are reviewing the best albums of recent years.

I mean I've always been a music aficionado, an audiophile that maybe should have gone to a music academy instead of film school—but I'm saving up to correct that now.

With a single AirPod, I've been able to catch up on the last half decade I've missed, uncovering a plethora of subgenres I wish I had known about earlier.

Pitchfork introduced me to *Heaux Tales* by Jazmine Sullivan which I’ve become obsessed with, and I’ve finally had time to properly admire *SOS* by SZA (which I’ve listened to every morning for the last month).

I take pleasure in honing my taste and listening to everything that's big every year. I want to be totally caught up, or at least as much as I can be.

Even now as I deliver tiny parcels to a slew of companies around a business plaza, I'm grooving to some *30* by Adele (an album I overlooked in 2021).

And with each handful of flyers, I'm keeping my eye out for events. You'd be surprised how much music you can discover via pamphlets. A lot of festivals make surprise announcements in print these days.

In my truck I opened a bright new “Arts & Culture” batch and saw promotions for local plays, a church charity event, and the upcoming film festival.

I start stuffing them in my many carrier pockets, Adele is belting it into my eardrums, asking the world to take it *‘Easy On Me.’* And over this soulful vocal I become drawn to a yellow brochure.

There was something familiar about it. Some assemblage of color was drawing my eye.  I held the thing close to my face and became captivated. Rivets went through my feet.

*There it is. That tree.*

The oak, with its twisting, claw-like branches that I would recognize anywhere, is centered in the middle of a tiny picture at the bottom of a tri-fold brochure.

Next to the image I could see the title.

*“Krew”*

*Dir: Oleksander Gołański*

*POLAND, 2023, 82 MIN.*

*In a stylized retelling of Polish folklore, we follow young Polina as she confronts the unfortunate deal she has made with the Devil. Gołański’s film is an unrelenting depiction of medieval Poland, drawing clever parallels to—*

I knocked over the whole stack.

“No. No way.”

I turned my AirPods off. Very carefully, I brought the stack back upright, and pulled out a single brochure.

It was for the Vancouver International Film Festival (VIFF), which celebrated new films from around the world. The little pamphlet teased a few big name directors from the US, as well as the expected art house fare from France and others.

At the very back was a snippet of crowd-drawing genre films. Including a sci-fi film from China, a voodoo drama from Nigeria, and at the very bottom … the horror film I worked on three years ago.

I considered throwing the pamphlet out. I considered throwing them all out. I could easily find a dumpster.

But then I realized I would probably be delivering these for the next two weeks. I would be seeing these every day.

*Whatever this is. It holds no power over me*. *It’s just a photo. Ink on paper.*

I brought the tiny tree right up to my face. Up close I could see a tiny figure in the gray dress standing beneath the tree. The thumbnail shot was so small you could barely make it out, but she was there.

An icy trickle went down my back. I put the thing down.

*The picture is meaningless. It has nothing to do with me.*

It was no different than the Save-on-Foods flyer I would hand out above it, or the mayoral campaign ad I would sandwich beneath it.

And that’s just what I did.

I created mini-stacks with the VIFF brochure hidden in the middle. I delivered the flyers face down, keeping them far away from me, most of the businesses didn’t even bother looking at them. They basically treated the whole thing like spam. Which in a sense it was.

As always, the last place I delivered to was a bakery\*. La Fleur d’Oranger\* in this case, a French pastry place.  After receiving mail, the owner offered me some of their delicious—yet-unsold—lemon tarts for the evening. I took a small box.

When I arrived home, Becca was waiting excitedly. She loved it when I brought baked goodies. Dinner might’ve been ready, but we quickly enjoyed a pre-dessert treat instead.

I might have only moved in last fall, but it feels like Becca and I have lived together our whole lives (we started dating two years ago). She was instrumental in helping me navigate out of the rut I was in. Although we met on a film set, and she still actively works as a DP, she's been the one to recommend that I get back into music, and helped me chart a better course for my life.

I love her very much for it.

Each night we shared our favorite '90s TV shows to each other (we both like going to bed on a light note), and tonight was her turn. She shared one of her favorite episodes of the *X-Files*, or as she called it “Akte X” (Rebecca grew up in Germany).

It was an episode about spectres haunting a church, which was nothing special in and of itself, but it was full of good jump scares.

Funnily enough it was X Files that drew Becca to Vancouver in the first place (yes, they also shot that show here). She was always in love with how many mountains, lakes and nature the show depicted. Her dream was to maybe work on something similar one day. That’s why she transferred to Van for her last two years at uni.

We snuggled and laughed at some of the cheesy CGI. There’s some cross-fade effects that make the episode’s ghost look more like a shitty VHS recording.

It was all very light, and all very fun until I turned the light off in my bed.

The episode is what must have seeded my nightmare.

I was opening the back of my delivery truck, throwing up the sliding metal door, when a floating version of Polina stared back at me. Before I could react, dark iron chains flew out and locked themselves around my neck, wrists and ankles.

I tried to wrench free, but the chains only tugged harder. I got pulled into the back of my truck, and tossed to the floor. The metal door came crashing down, and as I looked up through the darkness, I could see Olek's smiling pale face.

He brought a single finger to his lips. *Shhhhhh.*

My own sudden scream woke me up. Thankfully it didn’t disturb Becca. I got myself a glass of water and sat on the couch.

*You’re fine, it's just a dream. You’re fine, it's just a dream.*

I keep telling myself that I've stopped thinking about that day in the woods. That I’ve removed it from my brain.

But of course, it *is* still there, no matter how hard I try.

There was a seemingly endless period where all I did was think about Olek's film set. I wanted to report him. Call the police. The government. IATSE. Anyone.

I spent weeks trying to formulate the right words. Tried to assemble the event in a way that would make sense for anyone on the outside. But I couldn't do it.

Konrad Bartosz was gone forever, sure. There had been a murder, but did I have any proof?

The crew had confiscated my phone before they took me back to my car. I drove home crying that night, in a daze, and I spent the next couple weeks at home recovering, trying to piece together my sanity.

Without Konrad, without any history of my trip, I had no clue how to find that same road splintering off the BC-99. Even if by some miracle I did find where we had parked, I would have no clue where to walk. And even if I did find that same abandoned cabin or gnarled oak, what could I say?

That Olek convinced a ghost to possess people? That Kon’s body had been stolen by a wraith? That the people doing this were some cult of witches wielding unknowable powers?

I would be questioned to no end. I would be making myself a chief suspect for ludicrous crimes.

The couch had gotten wet. My hand was shaking so much that I spilled some of the water I was drinking.  My heartbeat was increasing. *This is stupid. I shouldn't be riling myself up like this.*

I drank what was left in the glass, and tried to clear my head. I got my AirPods and listened to the top ambient albums of 2022. I made a playlist of five of them. Eventually I slumped down, curled up, and fell asleep on the couch.

Over the next couple days I saw more of the same advert was supposed to deliver in the mail. By piecemeal I learned that *Krew* meant *blood* in Polish. And the film was supposedly a co-production between Canada and Poland. And it was having its Vancouver premiere in ten days.

I didn't tell Becca about it of course. I never told her any specifics about the set that traumatized my life. Instead I focused on my work, delivering mail to all the same routine places.

Although it crossed my mind whenever I caught a glimpse of that yellow brochure, I still refused to buy a ticket.

*Never,* I said to myself.

Two weeks quickly came to pass, and I had missed all screenings in Vancouver.

—

Then the obsession began.

It started when Becca asked me if there were any horror movies I wanted to see around Halloween. Immediately my thoughts traveled to *Krew,* but instead I said: “*The Grudge”,* and that's what we watched.

But I couldn't help but wonder how *Krew* was doing.

I followed the film’s festival run. It played at South by Southwest, Sundance, TIFF and I checked every press release or article following each screening. I searched for any controversy, weirdness or any other victims coming forward.

What other victims you ask? Well let me explain.

The week I had survived Olek’s set, I had waited to see if someone would contact me about Konrad's death. No one did. Then I scoured the database for all film productions happening in Vancouver, and there was nothing about an indy Polish horror. It’s like the entire event had been swallowed by a black hole.

But when I google-translated some Polish sites, I found some alarming stories. Stories about a videography team that was accused of abducting teenagers.

There had been an incident near Łódź where a death metal video was being filmed in the woods. They got a lot of young volunteers, and many of them went *missing* during the process of the shoot.

The main suspect was the producer for the video, a fellow named Łukasz Dębrowski. He had disappeared after the event, and as far as I could tell, he was still missing.

And that’s when I got thinking: could Łukasz be Olek?

He would have been arrested if he was ever caught filming in Poland again. Which is maybe why he had traveled to Vancouver.

And now with *Krew* screenings still happening around the world, I thought that maybe someone else would notice. Maybe another victim would attend and expose something revelatory for all the press to hear.

At first, There weren't any reports of protests or accusers coming forward. In fact, I discovered the opposite. There was nothing but praise for this risky artistic film.

*Krew* even won a critics prize at TIFF.

Then it played at Palm Springs and raised some controversy. Apparently there was a branch of PETA that denounced several films for abusing animals. *Krew* was among the list.

It struck me as odd, and not quite the condemnation I was looking for, but it felt like a step in the right direction.

So my obsession strengthened, to the point where I was checking every morning and evening for any news, video interviews, anything that might show me more of Olek’s face.

I learned the names of the seven missing teenagers who disappeared in Łódź, hoping for their mention somewhere in media. *Adrian Kowalski, Paweł Nowak, Martyna Wiśniewska, Michał Wróbel, Rafał Piotrowski, Gabriela Tomczyk* and *Weronika Nowicka.*

I was hoping for any kind of sign.

And then, as if sensing my desire for closure—the universe responded in kind.

Becca’s great grandpa was turning one hundred.

The family was inviting all friends and relatives to Germany for the occasion, and Becca felt obligated to go. In not so subtle ways, she told me this would be the best possible occasion to visit her family and introduce me to them.

“It's happening in Berlin, the same week as the Berlinale Film Festival! Wouldn’t that be fun?”

My face froze for a long time when she asked me, (I told her I was just thinking about my work schedule). And then I smiled and said. “Yes it would be fun. Yes I should come.”

According to the Berlinale website, *Krew* would be playing on February 22nd. Which would align with our dates perfectly.

I could see it.

I could be in the audience.

*Krew* would be playing at the highest profile European venue, at the closest distance it would ever get to Poland. If there was going to be any controversy, any victims showing up, any calls for Olek’s arrest … it would be at this screening.

I had manifested my opportunity.

Becca was thrilled that I had agreed, and talked up all the things we could see. I was supposed to be thinking about the Berlin Wall, the Tiergarten, the Reichstag Building, and all the fabulous restaurants we would get to experience. But that was all background noise. A series of pit stops before the main event. All I could picture was the day of the film screening.
