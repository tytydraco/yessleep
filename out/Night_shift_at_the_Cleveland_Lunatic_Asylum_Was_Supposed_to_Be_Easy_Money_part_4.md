I stopped it there.

Feed six: Break Room – Camera 2.

A fixed-angle view of the room, positioned high in the corner. The shot was crooked, like the mount had sagged a little over the years. I could see the back counter, stained sink, dented fridge, the water-stained drop ceiling. A coffee pot on a battered folding table. A single steel chair.

Danny stood in the middle of it, facing away from the camera, fiddling with the old drip machine. His shoulders were slouched and jittery — probably cold, probably nervous. He filled the pot from the sink with one hand while the other fumbled with the filter basket.

Totally normal.

Then he stopped moving.

Like someone had hit pause.

Just stood there, water still pouring from the faucet, steam rising slowly in the cold air. His body didn’t shift, didn’t sway, didn’t fidget. Not a single twitch.

I leaned closer to the screen.

He was staring to his left.

Not at anything in particular — just the wall. Like he was… listening?

Then he turned.

Still slow. Still strange.

And said something.

I couldn’t hear the audio — no mic feed on that camera — but I saw his lips move.

Two words. Maybe three.

He tilted his head, the way a dog does when it hears something high-pitched.

And then?

He laughed.

I felt the breath freeze in my throat.

It was short — maybe two seconds — a burst of laughter that came from nowhere and didn’t belong to anything. He wasn’t smiling. His face was stiff, almost grim. But he let out this low, mechanical chuckle like someone flipping through radio static and landing on the wrong voice.

Then he nodded.

Once.

As if someone had just told him something.

I squinted at the monitor, trying to see if there was anyone else in the frame. A shadow. A foot. A blur. Anything.

Nothing.

Just Danny and the back wall.

He took a step forward — not toward the coffee — but toward the far left corner of the room. The dark one. The spot just out of frame where the lightbulb had burned out weeks ago. I could barely see the edge of it in the feed. Blacker than the rest of the room.

He stood there, facing it.

His lips moved again.

Then he reached out, like he was going to touch something.

My heart pounded.

I don’t know why — but I turned away.

Couldn’t take it. Couldn’t watch anymore.

The office filled with sudden silence. Just the hum of the heater and the faint squeal of the wind against the old steel door. My hand was shaking. Bad.

I stood.

Paced.

Told myself I was tired. That maybe he was just talking to himself. People did that. Hell, I’d done that. Maybe he’d heard a noise — a rat in the wall, a pipe creaking. Maybe he’d remembered a joke. Maybe—

The office door creaked.

I turned.

Danny stepped back in, holding a chipped ceramic mug that said WORLD’S BEST DAD in faded red letters.

He looked fine.

Completely fine.

Too fine.

“Coffee’s not bad,” he said, lifting the mug slightly.

He smiled.

I tried to smile back.

Danny set the chipped mug on the desk and rubbed his hands together like someone who didn’t quite know what to do with them.

I was still sitting in the chair, half-turned toward the monitor bank, one hand on my knee, the other gripping the edge of the desk just a little too tightly.

He looked at me, head tilted.

“You good?” he asked.

I forced my voice to stay steady. “Who were you talking to in there?”

His expression didn’t change at first. Not even a blink. But I saw something flicker behind his eyes. Something small. Tight.

He shifted his weight, looked back toward the break room door like maybe the answer was still in there.

“Just… some girl,” he said after a pause. “Kinda weird, honestly.”

I kept staring.

“She came in while I was pouring water,” he added, scratching the back of his head. “Didn’t say much. Just stood in the corner and asked if I worked nights.”

“What did she look like?”

He shrugged. “Young. Long hair. Real quiet voice. Pale. Seemed like she was freezing.”

I swallowed. My tongue felt like cardboard in my mouth.

“What did she say her name was?”

He blinked. “Uh… Eleanor, I think. Eleanor Brooks?”

The words hit me in the chest. Not like a punch — more like falling into cold water. Sudden, full-body, breath-stealing cold.

I looked at him for a long time.

Then, very slowly, I reached over and rewound the feed on the break room camera.

The monitor flickered. Black and white grain. The timestamp rolled back one minute, two minutes, five. I stopped it. Pressed play.

We both watched.

The footage was clear enough. Danny stood at the counter, coffee pot in hand. Filling it from the sink. Just like he’d said.

But that’s all there was.

Just Danny.

He was talking — lips moving, gestures, a little laugh — but there was no one else in the room.

No girl in the corner.

No one speaking to him.

No one at all.

Danny leaned forward, his face pulling tight as he watched himself smiling, nodding, turning toward the dark corner like someone was standing there.

His eyes narrowed. Then widened.

“Wait,” he said. “No. No, she was *there.*”

I said nothing.

He backed away from the monitor.

“She was right there,” he repeated, pointing now. “You didn’t see her?”

“Danny,” I said quietly, “you were alone.”

He stared at the screen. At himself. At the empty space where he swore someone had stood.

His face drained of color. Lips parted, but no sound came out.

He stepped back again. Then again.

“She was real,” he said, but it came out weak, like he didn’t even believe it himself. “I talked to her. She looked at me. She said it was cold…”

He trailed off.

Silence fell between us, thick and dead.

The space heater hummed, filling the room with the low mechanical drone of a dying engine. It was suddenly too loud. Too hot. The room felt smaller.

Danny looked at me.

He wasn’t pretending to be calm anymore.

“Man,” he whispered, “what the hell is this place?”

I didn’t answer. What could I say?

He looked around like the walls were closing in. His movements were sharper now. Breath coming faster.

“I’m just gonna—” he pointed vaguely toward the lot. “Gonna grab my smokes. In the car.”

“You okay?”

“Yeah. I just need a smoke.”

He didn’t wait for me to say anything else.

He turned and walked to the door. Pulled it open.

Cold air rushed in, catching his jacket and sending a few loose papers on the desk fluttering. He stepped out into the lot, eyes darting to the cottages, then to the main building, then to the trees.

He didn’t look back.

The door shut behind him.

I waited.

Thirty seconds.

One minute.

I stood up, walked to the window.

His car door was still open.

The engine kicked on.

Then tires screamed.

The Omni peeled out of the lot so fast that one of the hubcaps bounced off and rolled in a wide, lazy arc before falling flat in the slush.

He was gone.

I didn’t chase him.

Didn’t even bother yelling for him to slow down as his piece-of-crap Omni screamed down the gravel drive and disappeared into the trees, leaving behind a cloud of dust and a dented hubcap still wobbling in the lot like a spinning coin.

I just stood there at the guard office window, watching it spin until it fell flat.

And then?

I laughed.

Short and humorless. One of those laughs that just slips out when your brain quietly unhooks itself from the moment. It was either that or scream into my jacket.

Danny was gone. I was alone again.

Of course I was.

I didn’t bother calling Jerry.

I knew what he’d say. That it wasn’t a big deal. That the kid was soft. That I’d still get paid for the full shift if I finished it. Maybe even get first dibs on a strip mall parking lot gig near Parma with a real bathroom and a working heater.

But I wasn’t staying with the company.

Not after this.

I sat in the chair next to the space heater and listened to it rattle and hiss like a dying animal. I didn’t even check the monitors. I couldn’t. Every time I thought about that moment — Danny smiling and saying, *her name was Eleanor Brooks* — my guts twisted and pulled like someone was tying knots in my stomach.

There was no coming back from that.

That was it.

That was the nail.

I made it through the night by counting the seconds.

That’s not a figure of speech. I sat at the desk with the lights on full blast and counted under my breath, all night, like a kid trying to distract himself from the dark at summer camp.

When the sun finally crawled over the treetops and bled pale gold across the roofs of the cottages, I stood up, stretched, and told the place — out loud — “That’s it. You win.”

Then I clocked out on the clipboard, locked the door, and got into the Nova.

I didn’t look back.

Not at the asylum, not at the gate, not even at the spot where Danny’s hubcap still sat in the slush, half-covered in frost like a grave marker.

The Burger King on Denison was open 24 hours — one of the few places in the neighborhood that didn’t care what time you showed up, how long you stayed, or whether you looked like you’d just seen a ghost.

Which I probably did.

I parked lopsided in the far corner of the lot, cut the engine, and sat there a minute before going in. The inside smelled like burnt grease and floor cleaner. Everything was tinted that sickly orange from the heat lamps, like a cigarette filter.

A kid who looked about fourteen was working the counter. He didn’t make eye contact when I ordered a small black coffee and a sausage croissant. Just took my cash, gave me the wrong change, and wandered off to yell at someone in the back.

I sat by the window, in a cracked booth under a flickering ceiling vent. The coffee was too hot to drink, and the croissant was cold in the middle, but I didn’t care. I wasn’t hungry. I wasn’t tired either, not exactly — more like my body had forgotten how to be awake and asleep at the same time.

The sky outside was turning pale and ugly. Yellow-gray clouds rolled in over the rooftops, and the wind blew trash across the lot in short, angry bursts.

I kept thinking about the way she moved.

Not walked — **turned.**  
The pivot. The slow, unnatural rotation. Like her feet didn’t quite touch the ground.

And how she disappeared.

I rubbed my eyes with the heel of my hand. Tried not to look like I was falling apart.

A group of construction guys came in around 8:30, all boots and hoodies and morning sarcasm. One of them gave me a nod. I nodded back. Human contact. Still real.

I waited there until the clock hit 9:00 a.m., sipping lukewarm coffee and watching the door like something might follow me in.

Then I tossed the cup, zipped my jacket, and drove to the security company office to tell them I was done with the Cleveland Developmental Center.

Done with ghosts.  
Done with boilers.  
Done with shift logs and monitors that lie.

The security office on Denison was quieter than usual when I walked in.

Maybe it was the hour. Maybe it was the hangover of whatever followed me from the graveyard shift.

The receptionist — the same girl with the bleach-blonde bangs and long purple nails — was chewing gum and flipping through a *Cosmopolitan* when she saw me.

She gave me a little nod. “He’s in the back.”

I didn’t wait.

Jerry was at his desk, same as always — tie askew, coffee-stained shirt, arm deep in a bag of off-brand cheese puffs like he was mining for gold.

He looked up as I walked in.

“Heyyy, there’s my guy. You train that kid last night? How’d he do?”

I didn’t sit down.

“He left.”

Jerry blinked. “What?”

“He talked to a ghost,” I said. “Said her name was Eleanor Brooks. Then he realized she wasn’t there. Got in his car and peeled out of there like his hair was on fire.”

Jerry stared at me for a second. Then slowly, very slowly, leaned back in his chair and rubbed his face with both hands.

“Not another one.”

“You’ve had more?”

“Guy before you swore the walls whispered to him,” Jerry said, already sounding bored. “Said the camera kept showing people who weren’t there.”

I just stared.

“And?” I asked.

Jerry shrugged. “We reassigned him to an elementary school in Strongsville.”

“Good for him,” I muttered.

Jerry gave me a sidelong glance, then reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a half-crumpled form.

“I can get you on something else. Gas station. Indoor. Daylight. No ghost girls. Whaddaya say?”

 “I’m retiring,” I said.

He blinked again. “Retiring?”

“Yep. From the private security industry. All of it. As of this morning, I’m a civilian.”

He opened his mouth like he wanted to make a joke, then thought better of it.

I turned to walk out.

“Hey,” he called after me.

I stopped.

“Don’t tell anyone about the ghost thing,” he said. “Seriously. It makes recruiting harder.”

I gave him a little salute without turning around. “Your secret’s safe with me.”

And with that, I pushed open the door, stepped out into the weak morning sunlight, and never looked back.

That was almost 40 years ago.

I never worked security again.

Did some warehouse shifts, loaded trucks, worked night stock at a grocery store that didn’t ask a lot of questions. Spent the rest of my life keeping to well-lit places and doors that locked from the inside. Never stayed up past midnight if I could help it. Never trusted a building with too many dark hallways.

I don’t talk about it much. Never did. Not to friends, not to the few women I tried to date. And definitely not to anyone who ever started a sentence with, *“You don’t really believe in ghosts, do you?”*

But sometimes — like tonight — I think about it. I think about that security office. That heater. That monitor screen showing Danny talking to thin air. I think about how calm he looked. How normal. And how fast he ran when he realized he’d been talking to someone who wasn’t there.

I think about her.

I only saw her once. But she’s still with me. Her name’s etched somewhere behind my eyes. Every now and then I’ll see a girl on the street with long dark hair and a pale face and my whole chest will lock up for half a second like the air just changed. Like it got cold.

I went back once.

Years later.

It was already gone by then.

The Cleveland Developmental Center, the cottages, the tunnels — all of it. Demolished.

I parked where the front gate used to be. There’s a playground there now. Real nice. New rubber mulch, bright plastic slides, smiling parents watching from shaded benches. A community dog-washing station. Bike racks.

And behind it?

Condos.

They call it East Ridge Reserve now. Gated community. Townhomes with gray siding and little American flags planted beside the mailboxes. I saw a kid ride by on a scooter wearing a dinosaur helmet, and his mom was drinking iced coffee on the porch, waving to the mailman.

They built all of it right on top of where the asylum used to sit.

Right over the cottages.

Right over the tunnels.

Right over Eleanor.

I tried asking around — real casual — at the leasing office.

The woman behind the desk smiled a little too tight when I asked if this had all been built on *Northern Ohio Lunatic Asylum* grounds. “Oh, that place?” she said. “Yeah, it was… like, condemned forever. State tore it all down back in the late 90s. Nothing left but concrete.”

I asked if they’d had any issues with the units.

“Like what?” she asked.

I shrugged. “Cold spots. Ghostly figures. Weird sounds at night.”

She laughed, but not really. “We don’t deal with supernatural issues,” she said.

Then she smiled again.

But this time, her eyes didn’t.

I didn’t stick around.

I haven’t been back since.

But I still wonder about those condos. About the kids who ride their bikes over the patch of ground where the east tunnel used to be. About the young couple who thinks their new home just has bad insulation when they keep waking up freezing at 3:33 a.m.

I wonder if anyone’s ever humming in the night without knowing why.

I wonder if they’ve ever seen someone at the edge of the yard — a girl with long hair and bare feet — standing very still in the dark, just watching.

Because no matter how clean the walls are, no matter how new the paint is, no matter how fresh the carpet smells…

That land remembers.

It remembers everything.

And some names?

Never leave.
