apologies for the bad punctuation, im writing this in a rush.

I've been living on this property for about 7 years, i bought the property for its natural beauty, the Adirondack trees espeically caught my eye, they are just so beautiful.

Anyway heres a background: I live in upstate New York and my property is off the bank of a river, there are trees everywhere. i live in the middle of a forest and it usually takes a 5 minute drive to get to the property.

So about a week and ago, im chopping wood for my fireplace, it was around October so i had to prepare fire wood before it gets too cold and wet.

so about 10 minutes into the chop as i call it i feel a sense around me, i had my headphones in so i took them out to see if there was like an animal or something near, as i could hunt it for that night's supper. a look around for about 15 seconds and i see nothing, but then i glance at an opening in the woods. something black and big was standing there if i could remember, i don't even know. it went by so quick i couldnt get a good description of it.

Being a skepticist of the "paranormal" as my friends say, i assumed it was a black bear, as they are common in my area, and it would it explain as why it was black and big, it couldve been standing up on its hind legs to get something in the trees. anyway i pass it off, i grab the firewood and i go back into the house. i grab a beer from the fridge to ease my nerves as i have arthritis, i sit down on the couch and i snuggle up with my cat Seymour, i put on a tv series ive been watching for the past week and i fall asleep.

the next morning im woken up to a huge crash on my ceiling, i bolt awake and Seymour is hiding in his cat tree. i immediately rush out the door not even to get my boots on. i look on the roof and i see nothing on there. strange because the house was a 1 story so the roof would be easilly accessable. i rush into the garage and grab my utility ladder, i put it up and climbed on to the roof.

i look on the roof and 5 shingles look bashed in, like someone vigorously stomped on it with an iron shoe. "What the hell?" i say to myself as this has not happen ever, i go back inside and Seymour is sitting on my desk ready to curl up and go to sleep. I say to myself that this is normal, that a big heavy bird couldve accidentally smashed into it. but that didnt make any sense at all, the damage to the shingles were too severe for a bird to have done it. i go to the back shed and i grab 5 shingles, a box of  nails, and a hammer to replace the ones on the roof.

after about 5 minutes of doing that i feel that sense again, i dont know how to describe it but it feels like.. an impending doom..? i dont know anymore. these events have stressed me out too much so i just went to bed. i wake up and i check my phone, its 3:25 AM, being frusterated i turn off the ambient music i was listening to and i try to go back to sleep, but then i hear something outside my room behind me. it sounds like a deep grunt, and its repeating over and over again. my room has a window far directly above my bed, so i get out and move to see what it could be and i see something that would haunt me to my core.

i see what looks to be 3 point elk antlers outside the window, and 2 eyes, HUMAN eyes.

as soon as i see them it bolts away and the grunting noise, i immediately put Seymour into my room and close the door. i run outside to the shed and grab my ithaca shotgun. i rush to where the window to my room is and i see tracks, its a mix of elk tracks and human hands.... what the fuck.

i rush back inside and i deadbolt all the doors, close the curtains and i snuggle up with Seymour, he seemed at ease for some reason. well it didnt matter, i turned on the tv and i watch a video until i fall asleep with Seymour in my arms. i woke up, its 8:59. i go into the kitchen and i see the glass plates are broken everywhere on the floor. at this point im freaked out. where is Seymour? i go outside and he somehow got into the garden, he was taking a piss like always.

after hes finished i picked him up and i brought him back into the house. i grab my shotgun and i walk into the woods where those tracks were headed, around 7 minutes into the hunt i found a totem pole, i figured it was made by one of the native tribes near the area, but as i think that i notice something on the top of the totem, a fucking head of one of the natives. following that i see their arms and legs on the side of the totem like a fucked up art project. and then i see on a tree near the totem, etched into the bark, "FEAR THE MARAUDER" what the fuck is a Marauder?

anyway i bolt back to my house not even looking back. and i head inside, i ponder of getting a watch dog due to Seymour but i went to Vet. i adopt this beautiful coonhound dog, hes loud and hes a good hunting dog according to it's previous owner. so i bring him back to the house. i named him Griffin and he and Seymour became instant best friends, so that makes me happy.

after a few days everything is going well except for that trauma i experienced. im chilling on the couch with the cat and the dog watching that show. and i hear something in the attack, like something is pouring onto the floor of it, wtf? so i grab my ladder and i open up the hatch and climb into the attack. there was nothing except for something all over the floor, teeth, HUMAN teeth. i freaked out and i climb back down. not even bothering to get rid of the teeth. i closed the hatch and put the ladder away and i decide to just call it a night. everything is too weird. i check my phone and it is April 12.

i wake up and then i checked my phone its April 14? i slept through the next day? anyway i immediately went to check on Griffin and Seymour, they are hungry AF so i feed them more than usual and i lay on the couch thinking of what happened. how could i sleep through an entire day? i put that thought to the side and i contiunue with my day, lackluster if i could descibe it and i just call it a night. and the next day i wake up its 11:23 PM. what the fuck is happening. why am i waking up so late. but the more important thing is i heard noises outside, like a howl and a scream, and crying? it has to be that creature.

i rush outside of my room and i was shown the worst horror ive seen in my life..

My dog and cat were mutilated in my living room. my cat was torn to shreds and my dogs head wad impaled onto a cross. i scream out in horror and the screams outside stop. i hear POUNDING everywhere on my house and crying, my own crying outside my house? i run back into my room and i lock literally everything. i hear scratching at my door.

it says my fucking name in a gutteral wispher as its scratching. im terrified.

its scratching at the door, as i had tried to hunt it a few days ago.. its now hunting me.

i have a knife, i dont know if itll be enough. at the mercy of whatever lurks outside my door its getting its way in. i pray that the day will break and it will save me.

its outside my door. and its almost in

someone help me before it gets in.

help.
