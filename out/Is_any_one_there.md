Thank you thank you thank you, the relief I felt to have contact with someone is unbelievable.
I'm not alone. 
Not virtually anyway.
It was honestly one of the best moments of my life.

Thank you.

My phone charged, the joy I felt was ridiculous until I couldn't ring anyone, I couldn't reach anyone anything anywhere.
Ring ring sorry you are unable to contact this number currently please try again later.
Again and again and again and again. The tears froze on my face as I tried again and again. 
I even tried 999 nothing just a dial tone.
Having my phone meant I could now look at the news, but as you can imagine I didn't have much luck.

I'd lost all hope.

Every bit of me was ready to give up.

And then you guys saved me. 

You random strangers on the internet saved me, because you're here I'm not all alone I'm not I'm really really not.

I'm not alone anymore.

The clock still tocks, so I need someone to break up the never ending tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock.

However, I do like my little clock friend.

I'm still in the Tesco's, I'm getting quite comfy in the managers office I borrowed a camp bed, I hope they don't mind. I miss home, my soft bed, my fluffy blanket, the dripping kitchen tap. Him.... I still can't remember his face, his name, it kills me. My heart aches for him but I remember his laugh.

So deep and rich, it always made me smile, I can hear it now when I think about it. Sickeningly sweet.

Anyway.

I still don't know where I am, I haven't been able to figure it out yet, I looked through letters and newspapers and books and maps and anything else you could possibly imagine it's as if I start to read the name and it's blurs. It goes black and I wake up with a heartbeat behind my eyes and a hour gone. It's difficult I just want to go home.

I've started to notice some things, just little things. Like I said I don't think I'm crazy yet, well maybe a little bit, but not full blown mental crazy though if I have to keep listening to the clock tick tock tick tock tick tocking anymore I might be.

But like I said, I do like my clock friend.

Anyway, getting side tracked as I always seem to, I've been noticing things. Just tiny little things. Stuff moving, just slightly.
Doors being left open when I know I shut them, a head popping round the corner but when I turn it's gone.

I don't know maybe I'm imagining it now that I know there's people out there.

If anyone wants to meet up I'd appreciate it, a lot.
It'd be nice to talk to someone who's not in my head.

Oh, also one last thing... Has anyone heard the screams?
