Part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1345sc8/i\_found\_a\_trail\_behind\_my\_grandfathers\_house/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1345sc8/i_found_a_trail_behind_my_grandfathers_house/)

As we walked forward on the trail, we saw a flickering light up ahead, illuminating the blood-red trees in a fiery glow. 


“What is that?” I asked Nathan and Nora. They walked in front of me, side by side, quiet silhouettes in the dark night. A creeping sense of dread rolled through me.


“Whatever it is, it belongs to the trail,” Nathan said. “This trail is older than human civilization, older than humanity itself most likely. The ancient ones have long lived in the space between universes, hiding in plain sight, coming out when they need to feed. They used to feed on the pain and suffering of animals, but ever since humans began to spread, they’ve grown accustomed to more… sophisticated tastes, let’s say.”


“Many of the ancient stories are based on true places,” Nora continued. “The river Styx and the ferryman Charon, for example, were based on visions of the mystics from ancient times. The souls of the dead wander in places like this, eternally trying to cross over to the other side. Their loneliness and despair feeds the beings in this plane of existence.”


“But we have protection against them, right?” I said. They just kept walking. “...right?”


“Well, some,” Nathan admitted. “But some of them might drive you mad just by looking at them. There is no such thing as guaranteed, absolute protection in a place like this.


“I just hope the tree sent us on the right path, because the wrong path would lead to something far worse than just lost souls.” The light grew brighter as we approached it. Soon, I could see a massive fire on the left side of the trail, blue and orange flames flickering off of it and illuminating everything around for hundreds of feet.


In front of it stood a child. She looked only five or six years old. She had a little blue dress on with dirty blonde hair and blue eyes. As I got closer, I saw she had an ear to ear grin on her face.


“Go slow,” Nathan whispered back to me. Nora looked totally unfazed. She just stared down a few feet in front of her, as if nothing was disturbing about this in any way.


The child’s head began to turn to the right, and then it kept turning. It spun backwards on her head, the skin on her neck stretching as the bones cracked and the tendons snapped, then finished turning in a complete circle. Blood was pouring from her eyes now, and her teeth had lengthened into points.


“Do you come to join the circle?” she asked in a low, childish voice. “We have many before you who have come, and they still stay here.” She pointed behind her to the fire, which suddenly went out. I saw blackened, smoking corpses lying on the ground there- still moving their arms and trying to turn their heads, their mouths opened in silent screams.


“We do not come for you,” Nora said, looking up and making eye contact with the demonic girl. 


“And how do you know we then do not come for you in return?” she asked, her face staying forwards now, the skin still stretched around her neck in a disturbing, twisted manner. “We do not appreciate visitors here. This is no place for the living.” 


Her limbs seemed to lengthen, her broken neck stretching out as her eyes darkened to pure black. Fangs began to emerge from her mouth. The corpses behind her twitched and moaned, trying to scream, but their melted, damaged faces just made small gasping noises. The girl laughed as she transformed into a creature straight out of my worst nightmares. All of her limbs were twisted, broken and oozing dark blood now. She began to walk towards us on legs where the bones poked out through the skin. Each step made a crunching, grinding sound as the broken bones rubbed together.


Nora began to chant, her eyes rolling back in her head. The language was low, growling and hissing. It was like nothing I had ever heard before. She reached in her pocket, grabbing a leather pouch and sending a shower of silver dust forward. The demonic girl screamed as it touched her. She began to revert from a mutated nightmarish creature back to the facade of a sweet little girl that she had taken when we first walked up here.


Without hesitation, Nate pulled out his gun and fired at her, hitting her in the stomach. The bullet went right through her small body, sending out a spray of flesh and bone from her back. The girl shrieked at him, her mouth disengaging and opening wide. Her cries were so loud that they made my ears ring. They seemed overlapping and continuous. Then she turned and ran, leaving behind drops of black blood as she fled the scene.


Without hesitation, Nora pulled a small glass vial from the inside of her satchel. After a minute, she had succeeded in capturing some of the blood from the injured creature. It looked like oil in the glass, shimmering and sending off iridescent colors as it splashed back and forth across the vial’s bottom surface.


“The blood of an ancient one,” she said to herself, so quietly that I almost didn’t hear her at all. I was badly shaken. My hands trembled. The gun Nathan had given me was out, but I didn’t really have confidence that it could kill everything here. A little girl shot with this caliber should have been on the ground, bleeding out, but she had just been injured and still able to run.


As we walked past the moaning, burnt corpses on the ground, Nathan bent over and put a bullet into the foreheads of each of them in turn. They stopped moving. I was glad. The girl had called these tortured souls her “circle”. How many more were there in this place just like them, I wondered.


I didn’t have long to think about it, though. The scenery was changing all around me. The dark-red, bleeding trees had begun to thin out, and behind them, I saw endless fields stretching to the horizon in every direction. They weren’t growing food, however. Crucifixes had been nailed into the ground in straight rows. Every single one had a body on it.


There were thousands of them, maybe tens of thousands. It was impossible to tell. The lines made a sight almost like an optical illusion as the cross symbol was repeated over and over, until they blurred together in the distance and disappeared.


Men, women and children bled from their hands and feet where they had been crucified, dripping fresh blood into the earth below. Ropes had been tied around their arms and legs to add more strength to the bindings, and likely to keep the nails from just ripping right through their palms. They continuously tried to push themselves up from the slanted wooden block their feet were nailed into, taking in a breath as quickly as they could before slumping back down, suffocating as their arms hyperextended their chests backwards. This process repeated over and over- the endless suffocation, the pushing up, the collapse back down, until eventually, the victims were too tired from exhaustion and blood loss to move. At this point, their heads would loll and their eyelids would begin to shut, their lips turning blue as they suffocated on the cross.


As I watched, I realized that many had already died. More were joining them every minute. Others looked fresher, and some even screamed out to us, begging for help, pleading for us to let them down and save them from this most horrible of fates. I looked over at Nathan, who was walking directly beside me.


“Just ignore them,” he said gruffly. “They’re not really alive, you know. You couldn’t help them if you tried.”


“They belong here,” Nora said. “They feed the trail. The earth itself feeds on their blood and suffering here. Remember that you are only here for one.” I nodded, refocusing myself. I had to find my grandfather.


The moans and screams followed us for miles. The fields seemed to never end. The dark soil of the trail just twisted through them, serpentine and winding, until finally I saw a break up ahead. The trees started up again, and in the middle of the path, I saw a circular rung of black metal.


“Ah, good,” Nora said. “I thought we would never get here.” Closing in, I saw the black metal was actually the railing for a staircase. The trail ended as suddenly as it had begun. A cluster of ferns and thorns grew wild beyond it, and the darkness of the forest was nearly impenetrable. I saw white eyes reflecting light back at me as I peered deeper inside. The eyes would have been on bodies at least as tall as me, but no human eye ever reflected such a silver glow in the dark.


“The endless stairs,” Nathan said, peering down. He wasn’t exaggerating. As I looked at the circular railing, spiraling down and down, they really did seem endless. Nora knelt beside the stairs, taking a knife and working off some of the grayish-blue soil that started on the top rung and clung to every stair as far as the eye could see. She grabbed a vial and gently poured some of the strange substance into it, sealing it tightly and putting it in her satchel.


I grabbed a huge rock from the nearby woods. Out of curiosity, I dropped it down the opening in the center of the circular staircase. It took off, falling faster and faster. Following its progress down so many stories gave me a sense of vertigo and nausea. I had to look away.


I listened for a loud clanking noise or any indication that it had hit the bottom. None came. After about thirty seconds, we all looked at each other.


“Let’s do this quickly,” she said. “We have nearly everything we need now.” Nathan nodded. I wondered what exactly these two were plotting.


“What do you plan to do with all this stuff you’re collecting here?” I asked. She shrugged.


“They’re just rare and expensive ingredients,” she said. “In my line of work, only a fool would waste such an opportunity.” She averted her eyes as she spoke, and I got the feeling she was lying.


“Let’s go,” Nathan said, pressing the button to release his magazine and refilling it with bullets. “This is by far the most dangerous part of the journey. Keep your wits about you, and your gun out.” We went down the stairs, each of us holding tightly to the railing. The clanging of shoes against metal was the only sound besides the slight breeze that blew through, even down here, under the earth.


After what seemed like twenty minutes of descending, I saw an aberration in the staircase. A door was built into the wall with a strange symbol etched into the wood. It looked like a backwards seven with a slash through it. The three of us stood in front of it, examining it.


I pressed my hand against the door, and realized that it wasn’t made of wood. Using my flashlight, I examined it closely. The door was warm and pulsating. It appeared to be wrapped in human skin.


“Better open it,” Nathan said to me. I looked up at him, then wrapped my hand around the knob. It was warm and pulsating just like the rest of the door. Without a second thought, I turned it and flung it open. We all peered inside.


At first, it just looked like a curtain of blackness. I shone the flashlight, but it did no good. I walked through. It felt like thousands of small fingers were running along my skin as I entered. The sensation gave me chills. They were cold, hungry, grasping fingers, and they weren’t used to the warmth and light of the living.


But after a few steps, the darkness broke, and I saw I was standing in a long hallway. The floors, walls and ceilings were all made of dark stone. Looking back, I saw Nathan and Nora emerge from the cloud of blackness. They nodded at me, looking pale and uncertain.


“This is the first circle,” Nora said. “We should find your grandfather somewhere around here.” A room emerged on the left as we walked further in. I looked in, seeing the horrific scene from my nightmares.


Harris McCuen stood there, surrounded by the still-living bodies of his family. His wife and daughters were choking on their blood, their lips turning blue as they lay in beds. They tried to claw their way forwards, ripping at the sheets and mattress, dying everything red with their blood. Harris turned to look at us, smiling. The back of his head was missing, but his face was intact.


“Finally, it is almost over,” he said. “You fools. You idiots. You woke him up. You woke up the Blind God. And now he’s coming. He’s coming. He’s…” Nathan didn’t hesitate. He raised the pistol and started shooting at Harris. Bloody holes opened up all down Harris’ chest, and he stopped talking, looking down in surprise. A look of happiness crossed his face as he fell back, his eyes fluttering then closing as an expression of peace came over his unmoving body.


I had lost sight of his wife and daughters in the shoot-out. Looking down, I saw a little girl had crawled right up to me, her slashed throat leaving a blood-red trail from the bed to my feet. Without hesitation, she reached a bony, clawed hand up and raked it down my leg. It shredded my pants and I felt the punctures go all the way into my muscle.


“Fuck, she got me!” I screamed, and started shooting blindly down at the ground. Blood poured down my leg. I stumbled back to the entrance, dragging my bad leg behind me as I went. The three of us got out of there and slammed the door shut.


“Wrong room,” Nathan said, sweating heavily. He started laughing. I sat down, and we wrapped a piece of cloth around my leg, tightening it to help stop the bleeding. Luckily, it hadn’t punctured any major blood vessels, and I could still walk, but it hurt like hell.


There was another room on the left. We opened it. It revealed what looked like a medieval castle’s main chamber. Corpses had been skinned alive, their intestines pulled out of their body and spiraling away from them, looking like fleshy, bloody snakes in the light glow of the castle’s torchlight.


And then, with mounting horror, I realized these weren’t corpses at all. The one closest to me raised its head, its face totally missing, its eyes ripped out. I could see every muscle of its head as it tried to speak.


“The Blind God… is coming,” it said. “The Blind God did this. The Blind God is coming. You’re next…” It started coughing, trying to use its flayed body to approach the door. The rest of the people did the same, trying to push themselves up on legs without skin, pulling themselves over small pebbles in the floor that got stuck to their internal organs and started new, small cuts all over their front. They started to reach their arms out towards us, moaning and pleading. Some had their tongues cut out, and they could only make indiscernible vowel sounds. Most of them wept- at least those who still had eyes.


I felt transfixed. I stared at this mass of wretched humanity. Every single one of them was still, somehow, alive. The floor of the castle was covered in so much clotted, thick blood that a slight ripping sound occurred every time one of the people lifted an arm or leg up while crawling forwards along the tacky stone.


Nathan pulled me back, slamming the door shut.


“Don’t look in there,” he said. “There are endless rooms like that one. It will serve you no purpose to go looking in there.”


“But what if my grandfather is like one of them?” I asked. “What if he was in there?” I felt feverish and panicked. Nathan shook his head.


“I doubt it,” he said. He wouldn’t elaborate. We kept walking forwards down the hall.


We found another room, further down, on the right. I opened it, and to my amazement, saw my grandfather’s fields. He stood in the middle, totally intact, his back to us. It reminded me of my dream.


“Grandpa!” I yelled at him. He turned around, his face half-torn off.


“Oh my God, Johnny?” he said, running up to me. The half of his face that was still intact formed a calm smile. I hugged him tight. “How did you find me?”



“Don’t worry about that. Are you OK?” I asked. I immediately regretted asking it. What a stupid question, I thought to myself. My grandfather shook his head.


“I’m sorry, son, but I’m dead,” he said. “I was attacked in the fields, dragged here. I died on the way. Something tore half of my face off. I didn’t see what it was, but I remember dying. It was… cold. Then I woke up here, in these fields. But Johnny, I have to tell you… I’m not alone here.” A chill ran down my spine at this.


“What do you mean, not alone?” I asked.


“There’s something coming,” he said, looking back and pointing. I followed his finger. In the distance, I saw a tiny silhouette. I squinted, trying to make it out.


It floated above the ground, moving at a superhuman speed, coming closer to the door. Whatever it was, its eyes had been torn out, leaving just black sockets. It was naked, emaciated and shrieking. It looked at least ten feet tall, and its shining black skin clung to its frame tightly. The noise it made was so piercing that I tried to cover my ears as it got closer and closer, but it didn’t help in the slightest. I could no longer hear what my grandfather said, but I saw him mouthing the same word over and over: “the Blind God.”




We pulled my grandfather forward, through the door, and slammed it shut. I heard that shrieking nearing, faster and faster. I looked between Nathan and Nora. Nora was slowly taking ingredients out of her pack, as if there was no rush in the world.


“Oh, yes,” she said, turning to Nathan quickly, “This is the perfect spot for the ritual. I can feel the energy flowing through this hallway, dozens of worlds colliding down here in the first circle. What a beautiful sight. What an absolutely powerful feeling.” Nathan nodded, sweating heavily. His eyes darted back and forth down the hallway. Then we all heard the Blind God on the other side of the door, very close now. His full attention turned to that, but Nora kept talking.


“I forgot to tell you, Nathan. Before I can transcend, I need one more ingredient- the blood of a betrayed friend.” Smiling sweetly, she pulled out a knife and shoved it into Nathan’s stomach as she spoke. He fell with a cry, and she kicked his gun away. Slowly, methodically, she traced her fingers in the blood that poured out of him onto the stone floor, licking it off with a moan of pleasure. “Mmm, I love it when it’s still warm.” She knelt down, putting the fronts and backs of her hands in the puddle of blood until they were totally covered, looking like wet crimson gloves pulled tight over her normal skin.


As Nathan crawled away, puddles of blood leaking out of him far too fast, she started the ritual. I started to raise the gun to shoot her, maybe in the leg or the arm, to stop her from whatever madness she was preparing to unleash, but with a swish of her hand and a cry, I felt the gun ripped out of my grasp and flung down the hallway.


She was distracted, however, having already begun the ritual. My gun was far away now, but Nathan’s was closer. Using the few seconds of distraction her focus on the ritual allowed me, I sprinted over to it, grabbing it off the floor.


As I ran towards it, I kept track of Nora out of the corner of my eye. She poured the demon child’s blood from the vial in her mouth, then, holding the blood under her tongue, blew the dust from the endless staircase in front of her. Holding out the piece of the Tree of Zaqqum in front of her, she walked into the cloud of dust. The cloud seemed to sit there, frozen in time, the particles reflecting the sunlight and shimmering, and yet neither moving in the breeze or descending towards the ground.


Nora began to scream in pain as she reached the center of the cloud. Her eyes started to melt, dribbling down her cheeks. The skin and muscle holding her jaw in place did likewise, and the jaw fell down lower and lower, held on by increasingly thin tendons and pieces of flesh. 


The tree root had started to grow, sending out leafy shoots and thick dark roots in all directions over her body. Her milky-white skin was soon totally covered in an impenetrable bark. She fell on her knees, vomiting up huge quantities of gore. Soon it looked like pieces of her stomach and intestines were coming up as well.


Her body was changing, morphing, growing before my very eyes. Her spine was stretching, the bones breaking and reforming. Pieces of bone shot out through her fingers and feet, very long and sharp. Soon all of her clothes had ripped away. She was crouched on the floor in a fetal position, sweating blood from the bark-like texture of her skin as bony spines started to shoot out of her back. This clawed, demonic figure looked nothing like the woman I had come in here with.


At that moment, the door smashed into pieces, and the huge creature my grandfather had referred to as the Blind God came into the hallway. Bent double, it barely fit through the shattered door. It looked like a black, poisonous snake had merged with a blind giant. Shreds of black robes still clung to its body in a few places, and giant reptilian claws jutted out of its hands and feet. With a shriek, it ran at the transformed Nora, biting at her and raking its claws across her back, puncturing the bark-like skin and sending rivers of red flowing out of her. She fought back with equal ferocity, biting with razor-sharp fangs and using her sharpened bony spikes to rip at every exposed area of flesh on the creature’s body. 


“Run!” I said, grabbing my grandfather’s shoulder and hauling him away. Nathan stumbled and fell, sending droplets of blood scattering all over the earthen walls. He tried to follow, but he was slow, wavering, grabbing at his side as he coughed up frothy, bloody spit.


We ran back up the staircase, past all the tortured souls who still screamed out for us. I saw another little girl blocking the trail. Stopping cold in my tracks, I pointed the gun at her head. Without warning, I started firing, using up the entire magazine.


Her head and chest had split open. Black, oily blood dripped out of her as she fell slowly backwards, a demonic grin still plastered across her face. I grabbed my grandfather and got us out of there. Even as I looked back, I saw some of her skin starting to stitch itself back together, though she still hadn’t risen. 


But we had almost made it home. I could see the field of my grandfather’s house in the distance at the end of the trail, a tiny pinpoint on the horizon that came closer and closer to us with every passing moment.


My grandfather took my hand as we ran towards the entrance of the trail, squeezing it reassuringly. I was seeing spots from running so long, my chest had stitches all up and down it, but I wasn’t slowing down until I was safe and away from this insane place.


“You did the right thing, son,” he said through gasps, tears running down part of his face, blood streaming down the rest. “I never deserved a grandson as good as you.” And then we hit the invisible wall dividing my grandfather’s property from this trail. As we ran through it, I felt his grip slacken, then release. Looking over, I saw his body rapidly fade, dissolving and blowing away in the wind. I had freed him from that cursed place.


I looked back and, to my total surprise, saw Nathan, still alive. He was a little off in the distance, at least a quarter of a mile, limping slowly, his clothes covered in blood. He came through the barrier, collapsing in my arms, hyperventilating and in clear pain.


“Please,” he said, “help me. It hurts so bad.” I laid him down on the soft dirt of the field and called an ambulance. I lit a cigarette as I waited, thinking about all the unbelievable things that had happened, wondering if Nora were still alive or if she were right now being tortured by that insane and blind monstrosity we had encountered. But as I listened to Nathan’s ragged breathing and moans of pain, I knew one thing for certain.


I used to be afraid of my nightmares, waking up every night in a sweat, screaming at the darkness. But I’m not afraid of them anymore.


Now I know waking life is so much worse.
