It was nearing midnight, and the bus station was nearly deserted. I had missed my earlier bus, so I was stuck here waiting for the last one of the night. The dim fluorescent lights buzzed faintly, casting long, flickering shadows across the cracked tile floor. A chill ran through the station, though whether it was from the cold or the eerie atmosphere, I couldn’t tell.

There was an old man sitting in the corner, muttering to himself. His lips moved, but no sound reached me. Occasionally, he’d glance my way with sunken eyes, and I’d quickly look down at my phone, pretending to scroll through messages. But my battery was almost dead, and soon, the screen went black. No lifeline. No distraction. Just me and the oppressive silence.

The minutes dragged on. I glanced at the clock on the wall—it hadn’t moved. The second hand was stuck, trembling as if it wanted to continue but couldn’t muster the strength. That’s when I noticed something odd: the shadows on the floor didn’t match the room. One of them was longer than it should have been, stretching across the tiles toward me.

I turned to see who it belonged to, but there was no one there.

The shadow shifted, slowly creeping closer. I felt my pulse quicken as I backed up toward the vending machines. My footsteps echoed louder than they should have in the empty station. The old man in the corner stopped muttering and stared directly at me. His eyes widened, and his mouth opened as if to scream, but no sound came out. He pointed at something behind me.

I didn’t want to turn around. Every instinct screamed at me to run, but my feet were rooted to the spot. Slowly, I forced myself to glance over my shoulder.

There was nothing there.

Or at least, that’s what I told myself. But the air felt heavier, colder. I could feel something watching me, its gaze pressing down on me like a weight. The shadow on the floor continued to stretch toward me, growing darker and darker until it was an inky black void at my feet.

The old man finally found his voice and screamed, “Don’t let it take you!”

That broke the spell. I ran, my shoes slipping on the slick tiles as I bolted for the exit. The doors wouldn’t budge. I pounded on the glass, yelling for help, but the street outside was empty, the streetlights flickering just like the ones inside.

Behind me, I heard the sound of dragging footsteps. Slow, deliberate. Getting closer. I turned around, pressing my back against the door, and saw it.

It wasn’t a person. It was a shadow, taller than any man, with no features except for two pinpricks of glowing red where its eyes should have been. It moved toward me, and the temperature plummeted. My breath fogged the air as I desperately tried to pull the door open.

The old man screamed again, but this time, it was cut short. I glanced over and saw him being swallowed by the same darkness that now surrounded the shadow. He didn’t even struggle—he just sank into it, his eyes wide with terror.

I don’t know how I managed it, but the door finally gave way, and I stumbled out onto the street. I ran without looking back, my heart pounding so loudly I could hear it in my ears. When I finally stopped, gasping for breath, the bus station was gone. Not just empty—gone. In its place was an empty lot, overgrown with weeds and littered with rubble.

I never found out what that thing was, and I never went back to find out. But sometimes, late at night, I still hear the faint buzzing of fluorescent lights and the dragging sound of footsteps coming closer.
