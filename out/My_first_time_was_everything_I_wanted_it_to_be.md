It is the first time I’ve ever done something like this. The feeling is exhilarating, if terrifying. Anticipation signs up and down my body. She said it was okay, that I would do great. At nineteen there was no bigger desire than this, at least from me. I thought about it constantly, waiting for the perfect time.

People in town scolded kids like me, said I was ruining my life if anything went awry. But I’m always careful. Too much could go wrong if I’m not. She could feel pain. I’ve been afraid of any blood there might be, but she said it happens sometimes. 

“It’s alright.” She says, smiling up at me. She’s a serene sight, the most beautiful girl I’d ever met. I can smell her scent, if I closed my eyes it’d be like I was laying in a meadow surrounded by a labyrinth of flowers. There’s honey in that meadow too. She always smells like honey, even that one time she tried to cover it up with perfume. 

I smile back, leaning over her. “I know.” 

I love her. She’s the most special person in the world to me. That’s why this moment is so important, why I cannot mess it up. “Are you comfortable?” I ask. She nods just once, smile never leaving her face. 

“Yes.” She answered. I nod too before sitting up above her just so. I have to get the right angle or it won’t be perfect. 

“Do it.” 

These words didn’t come from her, they're whispered-breathy and low-into my mind. We’ve been the only ones to speak all night but that doesn’t mean It wasn’t watching.

“Yes.” I say. 

Lifting the glinting knife high above my head, it plunges down with all my strength behind it. Blood rises to jump up like an ocean wave, coating every part of me that is facing her. She glows under the moonlight. It was perfect, we both were. I love her. She’ll feel so much better now, no more pain. 

I can feel It’s presence inside my mind. It is pleased with us, we’ve done well. The secret worry I had held about missing her vanishes. Of course I wouldn’t miss her, she is a part of It now. So am I. We’ll always be together after this. Neither age or sickness will take her from me. 

Kneeling above her, I place the knife next to her head on the smooth stone. It doesn’t step out of the shadows to claim it, but I know the knife will be gone by morning. My breaths come out shaky from the excitement, I feel my hands shaking too. Then, I started to cry. Joyful, subservient tears, my life was It’s now. She would be with me forever and I would be with her. 

It had tried choosing another couple a few years ago, when we were still too young. Everyone in town whispered about what happened. He hadn’t done it perfectly. It wasn’t pleased. But now, with us, it is. 

You can do it too! That’s why I’m sharing my story here, everyone should experience It. Don’t listen to anyone telling you It’s dangerous or that your first time shouldn’t mean anything. It means *everything.* 

I hope your first time is as perfect as mine was.
