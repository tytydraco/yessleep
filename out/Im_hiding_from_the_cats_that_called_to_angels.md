I don't know if there's anyone out there who will see this, but early this morning about 3:21 a.m. cats around my neighborhood started to chant that "god is coming", soon after disc-shaped objects glowing with bright lights appeared in the sky which the cats then chanted that "god is here". Yesterday seemed kind of off, but I would have never known it would lead to this...

I'm currently hiding in my house. I have no idea if it's just the town or the entire world that's been affected, but I decided to write about what's happened since yesterday. I have no idea who will read this, if there's anyone still out there to read this, but please send help.

I had worked a six-hour shift at the local café and was so exhausted, I couldn't wait to flop into bed and just sleep the day away. There is always a cat that I pass by on the way to and from work so I always have cat treats to give her. I never gave it a specific name, but I just call her Brown since that's what color her fur was.

After I gave Brown her treats and a few chin scratches I began to head home. I hadn't even taken three steps before I heard a somewhat high-pitched voice.

"...Pare..." it said.

I looked around confused, there was no one around to see. Sure cars were driving by, but no one was slowing down.

"Pre...Pare..." the voice came from behind me.

There was nothing there except for Brown, but she was a cat, cats don't talk. She looked up at me and stared, tilting her head as she was waiting for me to give her more treats.

"Sorry Brown, I don't have any more. Tomorrow I'll bring extra, ok?" I bent down to pet her. She had scrunched up her face and stuck her tongue out as my long fake nails scratched all over her scalp. I got back up, feeling bad that I couldn't bring Brown home. I couldn't afford it.

"God..." the voice spoke once more, I turned around and still there was no one.

I was admittedly freaked out and began to sprint home, it took me about ten minutes but as soon as I opened my front door I slammed and locked it. 

"Was I being stalked?" I thought.

After taking a quick shower and dinner I went to bed. It felt like I had shut my eyes only for a few seconds before I woke up to screams outside my house. I looked around confused, wondering where the source of the screaming came from. A second later I heard more screaming, but there was something else I heard.

"God... Is... Here..."

I got dressed and went outside. The first thing I saw was crowds of people running away, and they were being followed by cats. 

"What the hell..." I thought before looking up. I froze.

I was nearly blinded as I looked up to see bright glowing lights. There were disc-shaped objects in the sky. I couldn't tell how many there were, but they all stood still.

"God... Is... Here..."

I snapped back to reality and looked down to see cats walking towards me.

"God... Is... Here..." They said. I understood why so many people were running and screaming as I soon joined them.

The cats continued to chant as they followed. I ran with a random crowd into a dead-end. People were pushing and shoving as they tried to get out, but we were cornered. Cats had stood before us as they stopped chanting. A man within the crowd started to breathe heavily as he picked up a piece of broken glass off the ground. He pointed it towards the group of cats that approached us.

"Pre...Pare..." the cats chanted now.

"What the hell are these things!?" He shouted as he charged towards the group of cats, slashing away in fear. I had to look away. Even if they were some kind of monsters, I didn't wanna see cats getting killed.

By the time the man was finished, he had dropped down to the ground in a pool of blood and began to cry. Body parts were scattered all over and around him. I gasped at the sight.

Suddenly the parts began to vibrate as they moved towards one another, clumps of flesh and hair reattaching to each other as if the feline massacre was being rewound to when the cats were once whole.

Once the cats were reanimated they began to look up. The man looked up with tears dripping down his cheeks and his eyes widened, I'll never forget the fear on his face for as long as I live. I looked up along with the rest of the crowd and saw the disc-shaped objects stop glowing. The lights of the town illuminated the objects in the sky, there were some kind of doors under each object that began to open up. Shadows quickly hopped down to the ground, it felt like the entire world was shaking from the impact.

"Angel... Angel... Angel..." the cats began to chant.

"Shut up damn it!!" the man shouted.

He raised the broken piece of glass once more, but froze in place. The shaking continued. A large figure approached with an illuminated mask. The mask's light showed a large black feline body, devoid of any light.

The mask looked somewhat Egyptian, in fact, its appearance looked similar to the sphinx statue in Egypt. The giant figure's eyes looked down upon the man before it raised its paw and swiped at the man in a split second. Before I knew it, the man was impaled by the giant's claws. It took a few seconds before the man began to cry out in pain, begging for the giant to let him go, but he must've known it was useless.

The mouth in the giant's mask began to open as the man squirmed around to no avail. It moved its claws so that the man slid into its mouth and bit down on his neck, dropping his head onto the ground. Blood dripped down from the giant's mouth as it groomed itself.

The crowd began to panic as cats pounced towards us. pinning down people as the Giant stuck its claws into its victims like a fork sticking into food before being eaten.

I broke away from the crowd, dodging pouncing cats as best as I could, I saw more giants consuming innocent lives as I made it back to my house. I locked my door and began to barricade it, shutting the blinds and curtains on my windows.

It's been seven hours since then. The screams had stopped by five o'clock, but the cats continued to chant for angels. Once in a while I can still hear some poor person being found by the cats. I'm too afraid to make any sound. Even as I type I try to make as little sound as possible so I'm not discovered.

A few minutes ago I heard someone begging for help outside my window. It sounded like an old man, but something sounded off, his voice cracked in a way like his voice wasn't originally deep. I'm trying my best to ignore it, but I can't leave him out there...

I'm going to help him. I'll try to make an update as soon as possible. Stay safe everyone.
