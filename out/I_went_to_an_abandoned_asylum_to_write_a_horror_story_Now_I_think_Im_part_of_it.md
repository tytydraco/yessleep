I’ve always believed that horror can’t truly be written, it has to be experienced, lived. To me, horror isn’t just about monsters or killers. It’s about that feeling of unease that crawls up your spine when you’re alone in the dark, the irrational fear that maybe, just maybe, you’re not really alone. That’s what I’ve built my stories on... and people, my audience, seem to think I have a natural knack for it, something that makes the shadows in the corner of your eye come alive, something that stirs that primal fear just beneath the surface. 

I’m grateful for them, my readers, listeners, my wonderful audience. Every time I publish a story, they remind me why I do what I do. It’s not just about scaring people, though that’s a big part of it. It’s about digging deeper into what makes us human, finding the fear that lies in our own minds. But even with that passion, sometimes the well runs dry.

Lately, I’ve been stuck. The ideas haven’t been flowing like they used to. The words have felt… flat. My readers have been patient... wonderful, really. They’ve sent messages saying they’re excited for what’s coming next, urging me not to worry about delays. But they don’t understand what it’s like when the creativity dries up. It’s suffocating, like something inside you is decaying.

 I need something fresh, something real. Something terrifying.

That’s how I ended up here, standing outside the crumbling gates of Mendhurst Asylum. The place has been abandoned for decades, left to rot on the outskirts of town. The locals whisper about it, the experiments that were conducted inside, the patients that disappeared without a trace. The stories are enough to make it the perfect setting for my next horror story.

If I can survive the night.

As I walk through the rusted gates, the asylum looms ahead, an imposing structure half-hidden by twisted trees and overgrown vines. The wind is cold, biting at my skin, and the sky is a deep, slate gray, no moon, no stars, just endless clouds. I’ve never seen a place look so... lifeless.

The front doors are ajar, hanging crookedly on their hinges. I hesitate for a moment before stepping inside. The air is thick, and my footsteps echo loudly in the silence, each one bouncing off the walls, amplified by the emptiness.

The lobby is just as decayed as the exterior. The once-white walls are stained and peeling, and debris litters the floor. Old furniture, faded, broken, lies scattered across the room. A desk sits in the corner, long abandoned by the staff who once checked in patients. Behind it, a shattered window looks out onto nothing but the overgrown grounds. The whole place feels like it’s been forgotten by time.

But that’s exactly why I came.

I pull out my notebook, the one I always carry with me, and jot down a few thoughts. This place... it’s perfect. There’s a story here, I can feel it. The kind that practically writes itself. I just need to find it.

I begin to explore, wandering down one of the main hallways. The floor creaks under my weight, and every now and then, I hear faint sounds... drips of water from somewhere above, the groan of the old building settling. But nothing unusual. Nothing I didn’t expect.

The halls twist and turn, each one looking the same as the last. Cracked tiles, broken light fixtures, doors hanging off their hinges. I step into one of the old patient rooms, and I can almost imagine what it must have been like when the asylum was still in use. The room is small, with a single metal bed frame shoved against the wall, its mattress long gone. An old wheelchair sits in the corner, covered in dust and cobwebs.

I can’t help but feel a chill as I stand there, staring at the remnants of a life long forgotten. I can almost hear the echoes of the past, the distant sounds of footsteps, the low murmur of voices, the clink of metal as patients were wheeled down the halls. It’s eerie, yes, but it’s exactly what I need.

I take a deep breath and continue down the hallway. The farther I go, the more twisted the halls seem to become. Every step I take seems to reverberate through the walls.

I’ve been walking for what feels like hours when I come across something strange. There’s a room, its door slightly ajar, and inside, a chair and a bed covered in dust. But what catches my attention is the journal lying on the floor, its pages yellowed and curled with age.

Curiosity gets the better of me... I step inside and reach for the journal.

The cover is worn, the leather cracked and peeling. I flip it open, and the first page is filled with neat, careful handwriting. The date at the top is from years ago. I begin to read.

“I came to Mendhurst for inspiration. I thought this place would spark something, bring the stories to life. But something is wrong here. The air is thick, the silence unnatural. And the more I explore, the more I feel like I’m not alone...”

I stop reading, a chill running down my spine. This writer... this person, was just like me. They came here looking for inspiration, for a story. But what did they find?

I keep reading, my fingers trembling slightly as I turn the pages. The writer’s tone becomes more frantic, more desperate. They describe hearing faint whispers, seeing shadows flicker at the edges of their vision. They talk about feeling watched, about the sense that something is following them.

The last entry is abrupt, cut off mid-sentence.

“I can’t find my way out. The doors... they keep disappearing. I don’t know if I’m going in circles or if the building is... changing. But it feels like it’s trying to keep me here. I just saw something at the end of the hallway. They were standing there, watching me. I don’t know what to do. I think they know my name. I think they...”

The rest of the page is blank.

I slam the journal shut, my heart pounding in my chest. This can’t be real. It’s just a story. But as I stand there, gripping the journal in my hands, I can’t shake the feeling that maybe... maybe it’s not.

I stood there, the journal clutched tightly in my trembling hands. 

The writer’s words echoed in my head. "The doors... they keep disappearing. I don’t know if I’m going in circles or if the building is... changing."

I tried to convince myself it was just a trick of the mind. The isolation, the decaying surroundings... it was all getting to me. Writers tend to have overactive imaginations, right? But then, why did it feel so real? The heaviness in the air, the whispers of the wind sneaking through broken windows, the sensation of being watched.

I had to keep moving.

Shoving the journal into my bag, I left the room. The hallway outside looked the same as before... long, narrow, with walls that seemed to stretch into shadowy oblivion. But something was different. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, but the place felt... alive, like the building itself was aware of me, adjusting to my every move.

As I walked, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being followed. Every step I took was met with the faintest of echoes, like footsteps mirroring my own, just a split second behind. My throat tightened, and I picked up my pace, trying to drown out the growing unease gnawing at my gut.

I turned a corner, my eyes scanning the hallway for familiar landmarks. But everything looked the same... the same cracked walls, the same scattered debris, and there was no sign of the way I came. The hallway stretched forward into an unknown part of the asylum, and when I turned to look behind me, the corridor had twisted again. The path that should have led back to the entrance was gone.

No door. No sign of where I had come from.

I tried to calm myself, taking deep breaths, but the walls seemed to pulse with every beat of my heart. The asylum wasn’t just a place... it was a maze, a labyrinth that was shifting and reshaping itself around me.

I needed to get out. NOW!

I pushed forward, trying door after door, hoping one of them would lead to an exit. But every door I opened led somewhere new... a different room, a different hallway. It was as if the asylum was leading me deeper into its depths, pulling me further away from any sense of reality.

Finally, after what felt like hours of wandering, I stumbled into another room. The door slammed shut behind me with a heavy thud. The room was small, its floor littered with broken furniture and medical equipment. But it wasn’t the debris that caught my attention... it was the figure standing in the far corner, barely visible in the dim light.

At first, I thought it was just a shadow. But as my eyes adjusted, the figure began to take shape. It was a man, or at least, it had been once. His frame was skeletal, his hospital gown tattered and stained. He stood motionless, staring at the wall, his back to me.

I froze.

The figure didn’t move. It just stood there, its head tilted slightly to the side, as though listening for something. I wanted to run, to turn and bolt out the door, but something kept me rooted in place.

Then, slowly, the figure turned.

Its eyes, if you could even call them that, were hollow, empty sockets, dark and lifeless. Its face was gaunt, pale, and stretched tight over its skull, as though it hadn’t eaten in years. But worst of all was the way it looked at me, its gaze piercing through the shadows.

It knew me.

“Junior...” The voice was a whisper, barely audible, but it cut through the silence like a blade. “Junior...”

I stumbled back, my hands fumbling for the door behind me. The figure didn’t move, but its hollow gaze followed me, its lips curling into a grotesque semblance of a smile.

“Junior... come back...”

I yanked the door open and fled, my feet pounding against the floor as I ran down the twisting halls.

The halls stretched endlessly before me, twisting and turning in ways that made no sense. No matter how fast I ran, the corridors seemed to warp, looping back on themselves. I was trapped. Every door I tried either led back to where I had been or to rooms I hadn’t seen before.

I had to stop.

Panting and drenched in sweat, I leaned against a wall, trying to catch my breath. My legs were shaking, my chest tight with fear. I couldn’t keep running like this. My mind was spinning, my thoughts a chaotic jumble of panic and confusion.

That’s when I saw something.

Down the hall, just barely visible through the flickering lights, a figure moved. It wasn’t the same man from before. This figure was smaller, its form more solid than the flickering shadows I had seen earlier. It shuffled forward, dragging something behind it... a hospital gown, torn and stained with age.

I took a step back.

But the figure didn’t move toward me. Instead, it shuffled down the hall, as though it were reliving some long-forgotten memory, pacing in an endless loop.

I watched in horror as more figures began to flicker into view, appearing and disappearing at the edges of my vision. Some were sitting in chairs, rocking back and forth. Others were pacing like the first figure, their movements slow, their eyes vacant.

But then, one by one, they began to notice me.

Their heads turned in unison, their hollow eyes locking onto me, as if they had been waiting for me all along. And then, slowly, they began to move. Their arms stretched out, reaching for me, their whispers growing louder.

“Junior...”

I turned and ran again, but this time the figures followed, their footsteps echoing down the hall. I could feel their presence behind me, their whispers filling the air around me.

“Junior... you can’t leave...”

My legs were on fire, my lungs burning as I pushed myself forward. I was running out of time, out of options. The asylum wasn’t just trying to trap me... it was consuming me, pulling me deeper into its endless maze of horrors.

Just when I thought I couldn’t run any further, I saw a door, pristine, untouched, standing at the end of the hall.

I sprinted toward it, my hand reaching for the handle.

I yanked the door open and stepped inside.

The door clicked shut behind me, and the oppressive silence of the asylum was swallowed by an unnatural calm. I stood there, breathing heavily, my body still trembling from the chase. The room I had entered was unlike any I had seen so far. It was pristine, spotless, untouched by the decay that had consumed the rest of the building.

The walls were painted a soft, sterile white, the floor gleamed as if it had just been polished, and the furniture was neatly arranged, with no sign of dust or debris. There was no flickering light here, no creaking floorboards or unsettling echoes. It was as if this room had been frozen in time, preserved in perfect condition.

In the center of the room, illuminated by a soft, almost welcoming glow, was a single desk. On top of the desk was a file, thin and nondescript, just lying there, my name was printed neatly across the top of the file.

I approached the desk and flipped open the file

Inside were photographs. Photographs of me. They were old, some from my childhood, others from my teenage years, and a few that looked like they had been taken just days ago. Each one was carefully placed in chronological order, documenting every significant moment of my life. But it wasn’t just the photos that unsettled me, it was the detail. Every smile, every look of fear, every moment of joy or pain was captured perfectly, as if someone had been watching me all my life.

Beneath the photographs were detailed notes, medical records, personal anecdotes, things that no one else could possibly know. Private moments, thoughts I had never shared with anyone. It was all there, written out in meticulous detail.

I flipped through the pages, my hands shaking. The more I read, the more disturbed I became. It was as if the asylum had been recording everything about my life. But that wasn’t possible... right?

As I turned to the final page, I noticed something that made my heart skip a beat. The last entry wasn’t about my past, it was about my present. Written in neat, precise handwriting, it described exactly what I was doing in that moment.

"Junior stands in the file room, reading the file, his hands trembling, his breath shallow. He is filled with a growing sense of dread, his mind reeling with the impossible realization that the asylum has always known him."

The file was updating itself in real-time, documenting my every move, my every thought. It was as if the asylum was writing my story, just as I had tried to write its own.

I dropped the file, stumbling back from the desk.

I turned to leave, grabbed the handle, and threw the door open, stumbling into the hallway.

But as I looked back, the door was gone. There was nothing behind me but a solid wall. 

I tried to focus on finding a way out. But no matter which direction I turned, the corridors stretched on endlessly.

I don't know how long I wandered those halls. Time had lost all meaning. 

The whispers had returned. They echoed down the halls.

"Junior... you can't leave..."

The voices followed me. They were taunting me, dragging me deeper into the asylum’s madness. 

My notebook was in my hand, open to a previously blank page. Now, it held the story... the one I had been trying to write, the one I had come here for.

But it wasn’t my story anymore.

It was the asylum’s.

I stopped, staring down at the words. The handwriting was no longer my own. It was jagged, unfamiliar. 

Then, the whispers grew louder and... I saw them.

The figures, standing at the end of the hallway, flickering in and out of existence.

I turned and ran.

They were following, their whispers filling the air, closing in on me.

"You can't leave... You belong to us now..."

I rounded the corner, saw a door, and went through it.

But this time, there was no hallway beyond. No room. No walls.

There was only darkness, like I was standing in the middle of a void. I could hear the whispers all around me, echoing in the blackness.

I wasn’t going to make it out.

I took a step forward, my body trembling, my mind racing. 

And then, I heard a voice.

"Junior..."

It wasn’t the whispers. This was different. It was deeper, more ancient.

"You can’t leave... You never could."

I fell to my knees, my hands shaking. The notebook was still in my hand, the pages filled with words I didn’t remember writing. The asylum had written its story.

I looked up, my eyes straining against the darkness. The figures were closer now, surrounding me, their faces still blurred, but their eyes... their eyes were hollow, empty.

And then I understood.

The ones who had come before me... they hadn’t left. They couldn’t leave. They were trapped here, just like I was. And soon, I would be one of them.

A shadow flickered at the edge of my vision, and I turned to see the figure from the room. It stood there, silent, watching me.

"You belong to us," it whispered, its voice echoing in the darkness. "You’ve always belonged to us."

But then, a thought cut through the fog of panic. I still had one weapon left. The only thing I still had... my story.

I took a deep breath, trying to still my shaking hands. The notebook lay open before me, its pages filled with frantic, chaotic scribbles. The asylum had been writing this story for me, pulling the strings, twisting reality to fit its twisted narrative. But this... this part was still mine.

I grabbed the pen. The whispers grew louder, the figures moving closer, but I shut them out, focusing only on the blank page in front of me.

I began to write.

"The asylum twisted, its walls pulsing, its darkness suffocating. The whispers grew louder, but they couldn’t stop him now. Junior stood tall, pen in hand, and wrote his way out. He refused to be a victim of the asylum’s story. This was his story."

The void around me trembled as if the very fabric of the asylum was struggling to hold itself together. I could feel it pushing back, trying to stop me, but I wasn’t going to let it.

"As Junior wrote, the darkness began to crack. Light pierced through, illuminating the figures that had been chasing him, holding them back. They couldn’t reach him anymore. They couldn’t stop him."

The air grew lighter as I continued writing. The whispers faltered, as they tried to claw their way back into my mind.

"And then, before him, a door appeared. The exit. The way out."

The darkness shuddered, and there it was. The door. A real door. Not an illusion, not a trick, but the exit I had been searching for all along.

I stood, barely able to believe it, but the pen never left my hand. The figures, those hollow-eyed remnants of the lost, were frozen now, caught in the breaking fabric of the asylum’s reality. They couldn’t follow me anymore.

I ran toward the door, the light growing brighter as I approached. I could feel the asylum shaking around me, the walls cracking, the darkness retreating. The figures screamed... one last, desperate cry to pull me back, but I reached the door.

"Junior stepped through the door, leaving the asylum and its horrors behind."

I turned the handle and stepped into the light. I was out.

I made it back to my car. It was parked right where I’d left it, just outside the rusted gates of Mendhurst Asylum. My hands were still shaking, my mind reeling, but I didn’t waste time questioning it. I got in, turned the key, and drove.

The road blurred as I sped down the empty streets. It wasn’t until I saw the lights of my house in the distance that I finally let myself breathe. 

When I got home, I went straight to my desk. The notebook sat in front of me, still open to the last page I had written. My hand shook as I picked up the pen, but there was still one thing left to do.

I had to finish the story.

The words flowed out of me easily now. I wrote about the asylum, about the figures, about how the walls had twisted and shifted, trying to trap me. But most of all, I wrote about how I had escaped. How I had found my way out. How I had written my own ending.

And then, as the story reached its final moments, I realized something.

This story wasn’t just mine anymore.

As I sit here, writing these final words, I can’t help but feel a strange sense of connection with you! You’ve been with me through all of this, haven’t you? You’ve followed me through every step of this nightmare, reading each line, feeling every moment of tension, fear, and dread.

Maybe you felt safe, knowing it was just a story. Just words on a page, right?

But here’s the thing: I’ve come to realize that stories like this one have a funny way of getting under your skin. Maybe it’s just your imagination, but sometimes, when you get too caught up in a tale, the line between fiction and reality starts to blur.

And here we are now. You... reading this, and me... finishing it.

But before I end, I want to ask you something. How closely have you been paying attention? Have you felt it? That little itch at the back of your mind, that nagging feeling that something isn’t quite right? Maybe a sense that you’re being watched... even now?

I don’t mean to alarm you, but as I write these words, I can’t shake the feeling that the story might not be confined to these pages. Maybe, just maybe, it’s found its way into your world. After all, stories have a way of spreading, seeping into the cracks of our reality.

You probably think I’m just messing with you, and maybe I am. But humor me for a moment. You’ve been sitting here, reading my words, but have you thought about your surroundings? That faint noise you might’ve heard a moment ago? Or the way the shadows behind you seem to shift ever so slightly?

No? That’s good. Let’s keep it that way.

But if you’re feeling brave, if you think none of this is real, I dare you to look behind you right now. Go ahead. Take a quick glance.

Still here? Good. Because if you had turned around, well... you might’ve seen something you didn’t want to see. And that’s the thing... once you look, you can never unsee it.

So maybe, just maybe, it’s better to stay right where you are.

But hey, it’s only a story, [right?](https://www.reddit.com/user/CreepyStoriesJR/comments/1ilh8mp/creepystoriesjr_story_list/)
