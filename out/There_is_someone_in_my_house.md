A blanket of stars dominated the night skyline, marinating in the moon’s bright radiance. Thin, gray tendrils of clouds floated effortlessly, sometimes blocking the luminous view perched before me. The scorching summer heat has now cooled down, assisted by a favorable breeze that gently ruffled my twists—allowing me to scan for constellations without sweat blinding my vision. I spotted the Big Dipper in all its glory in the northeast despite partially obstructing it by gray clouds. This discovery did not excite nor deter me since I could always spot the typical constellation somewhere in the night sky. The only thing that changes is the location. That is the fun part, I suppose. The bad part about stargazing is by the time I head home, my eyeballs are sore from the constant straining to spot these patterns of art that shimmered and gleamed with such majestic prowess; I could see why the Cold War involved this radiant void.



I began to feel the soreness in my eyeballs, so I took a quick break from stargazing. I rub my eyes and adjust my position on the tractor. I utilize this moment to scan my surroundings. There is no movement nor suspicious sounds among the army of tall grass that encircled the dirt clearing. Only the occasional gust of wind that sings a song of tranquility I cannot hear but can only see due to the tall grass swaying gently in unison. Elevated by my position on the tractor, I spot my house in the distance. The lopsided cherry brick ranch rested effortlessly on a steep hill. A long, gravel path stretched from the home to the main road. I could see light in the kitchen window if I squinted just enough. 



My heart somersaulted as I realized I had turned off the lights before heading out, an essential step in my security routine when leaving the ranch. I adamantly remind myself to lock the doors, especially the backdoor leading to the backyard. My backyard is about 50 yards long and broader than most. A chicken wire fence maintenance secured the space. As you know, when living in rural places, you are expected to acknowledge that you are a guest and only a guest in the realm of Mother Nature. Over the years, I had my run-ins with wild animals of all kinds. Possums, stray dogs, and even cows have encountered my property several times.



The scariest encounter was when a lone coyote stumbled into my home on a day that felt like the sun was lonely in space and decided to move closer to Earth. I left the back door ajar to let in the cool air because my AC unit malfunctioned. The next thing I knew, I managed to slide my sweaty ass off the couch and was face to face with a lone coyote. I will never forget the silence that hung over us like a foul odor as we had an intense staring contest for what felt like an eternity. The coyote gritted its teeth, producing a low growl, and began to stalk forward a few steps. Despite being rigor mortis from fear, I had the presence of mind to make myself a more prominent target by raising my hands and yelling menacingly. The coyote skittishly backed off, leaving claw marks on the wooden floor as it desperately tried to escape. The startled coyote fled down the backyard and cleared the five-foot chicken wire fence, disappearing into the tall grass. 

  


Recalling this memory distracted me from the dreadful thought of dealing with something other than an animal, alleviating the anxiety and dread I felt as I waded through the tall grass. Silence hung in the air, amplifying the sound of me crushing the gravel beneath my sneakers as I trekked the steep driveway. The light in the kitchen, and only in the kitchen, illuminated the window pane. I stood six feet in front of my house. I reached into the leather holster resting on my right hip and pulled out the revolver. The silver frame glistened under the moonlight. I carefully cocked the pistol and heard a satisfying click. I took a deep breath and pointed the gun right at the front door.



“Whoever is on my property, I am armed and unafraid to shoot. Please come out with your hands up!”I barked fiercely, purposely projecting my voice to sound more threatening. No response came from the house. As every second passed, I felt the anxiety expand within my lungs. I snorted erratically and stood still as a statute,  pistol raised and aiming at the oak door with a death grip despite sweat clinging to my palms. “This is your last warning, or I am coming in.” Again, there was silence. Gathering myself mentally, I prepared to confront whoever was inside my home. 



As I approached the door, the light in the kitchen window suddenly turned off. Then, I heard rapid movement from the kitchen as if the intruder was sprinting toward me. I quickly backed up, more focused than ever, finger resting on the trigger. The sound of footsteps ceased. A small slit of light then shines under the door, and parallel to one another are two lumpy shadows. I suspected the perpetrator was standing before the door, but what I heard next sent chills down my spine. Over the beating of my heart, I heard ragged breathing coming from the door. It sounded more like wheezing as if it needed an inhaler, and each breath was weaker than the last. A foul odor lingered in the air, violating my nostrils. A scent of decay and rot resonated from the door. I grimaced and had to fight my stomach from upheaving the lasagna I had eaten for lunch earlier. Trying to be as rational in such a nerve-wracking situation, I logically guessed it was a homeless man. This thought eased me a little bit, but it still worried me.



Clearing my throat, I calmly and sternly said, “I am calling the police, so do not make this more complicated than it has to be, sir. Just come out and surrender.” I waited for an intelligible response, dreadfully hoping that whatever was in my home was human. My wishes came up short as I heard more sporadic wheezing—no words, just wheezing. The rancid smell grew more potent as time passed, flooding my eyes with tears. I called out again, this time more menacing than the last, but the intruder was not intimidated nor frightened as I heard more wheezing and coughing. 



My mind spiraled with uncontrollable thoughts about the right course of action. Should I call the police and wait it out? Should I take a warning shot to know I mean business? More and more suggestions piled on top of one another, causing my temples to flare in pain. The wheezing grew louder as I congregated with myself, and the smell became almost unbearable. I had no choice but to decide, encouraged by the thought of losing my sanity and harming myself.



I recollected myself and shouted firmly, “You left me no choice.” Despite the nervous jittering of my arms, I steadied my aim at the door. I fixed my eyes on the door, center mass, and pulled the trigger. My ears rang like wind chimes as I felt a shockwave leave my body. In the blink of an eye, the bullet escaped the barrel and exploded through the door, leaving a crater the size of a tennis ball. A hole big enough that I could see that there was nothing there. Just tiny splinters of wood twirling in the air before floating to the ground below. I did not hear any wheezing anymore. The sickening stench was no longer saturating the air, and I could breathe in the fresh air of the land beyond.



Remaining alert, I raised my gun once again and strolled to the front door. I kicked it, and the door slammed against the wall with a thud, revealing nothing: no menacing figure or a distraught homeless man in sight. A shroud of darkness cast serpentine shadows along the walls. I could not see much but could smell. The inescapable aroma of lavender washed over me like a wave. I hoped the scent was potent enough that I would dissociate and not have to be present in such a frightening dilemma. I pressed my free hand against the wall and tried to find the light switch. Eventually, I found the smooth plastic and flicked the knob. A beam of yellow light rained down upon the room.



I then noticed a set of dirty footprints leading to the living room. Whoever was in my home did not have shoes and walked barefoot, fueling the possibility of a random hobo stumbling upon my property to crash for the night. The light above me faintly illuminated most of the living space. I saw my leather sofa facing the coffee table littered with sports magazines and countless lottery scratchers I impulsively bought from the gas station. A flat-screen TV rested above the mantle. I gradually followed the trail into the living room. I meticulously observed each footprint, which began to shrink in size as I continued the trail. This discovery perplexed and frightened me. I gripped the pistol tighter and moved a couple more steps.



It was not until my shoe sank into the living room carpet that the footprints had entirely changed. The footprints were no longer footprints but paw prints of a small animal. I shuddered due to the harsh ice filling my veins, turning my blood cold. It was like the intruder had transformed into an animal mid-step. I immediately shot it down as a possibility and scoffed at the idea, hiding the feelings of fear and dread that rose within me like warm air on a windy day. I squinted my eyes and analyzed the pawprints. Like a light switch, I recognized the tread and pattern of the prints. The pawprints belonged to a coyote. I immediately recall the encounter I experienced not long ago with the stray coyote I found in this room. 

As I stood frozen in thought, a sudden wind massaged the back of my shirt and blew some of the tattered lottery scratch-offs off the coffee table. Startled, I turned around and saw that the back door leading to my yard was slightly ajar. I felt the strange feeling of deja vu creep into my bones. A slosh of mucus obstructed my throat, and I struggled to breathe. I tracked the pawprints from where I was to where it led. The pawprints lead straight to the backdoor. Whatever it was, it seemed it had quietly slipped out and fled into the night, concealed by the starry gloom in the sky above. I hastily shut the door and turned the lock. Mentally and physically exhausted, I plopped onto the sofa and lay my pistol on the coffee table. The adrenaline coursing through my veins was no longer there, and I felt every muscle fiber loosen. I sunk further into the sofa and shut my eyes. My body ached for a soothing Epsom salt bath, but I could not force myself to leave the couch. My eyelids started to get heavy, and I soon voyaged across the outer depths of my consciousness to the tranquil world of slumber.

  


The earsplitting noise of glass shattering shook me awake. I bounced off the sofa with such haste that I nearly tripped myself. I snatched the pistol and aimed the barrel at the backdoor. Something outside had crashed dead center through the window next to it. 



It now rested across the carpet a few feet from where I was—a lifeless heap of mangled orange and grey fur—a rotting corpse of a coyote. My stomach somersaulted, and I struggled not to upheave as the familiar scent of decay returned, potent and more rancid than before. A milky-grey color was present in its eyes. The coyote looked blind or had cataracts. It was missing a paw; instead, exposed flesh and bone occurred. A deep incision ran from its neck to where the tail began. Its bloody entrails and innards sprouted from the gash like a grotesque flower. Tucked into the corner of its snout was a piece of cloth. I covered my mouth and nose with my shirt and retrieved it.



After further review, I discovered it was not cloth but scrap paper—half of it was blood-soaked, and tiny scraps of coyote flesh freckled it. Despite the mess, I could make out letters spelling a single word. A word that raised the hair follicles on the back of my neck and tattooed thousands of goosebumps upon my forearms.

  


Skinwalker.
