One night I was home and my family, which consisted of my Mom, Dad, brother, sister and me. We were watching TV. Both my parents worked multiple full time jobs, so all of us being home at the same time was a rare occasion. My brother and I had just come home from swim practice and my sister had come home from dance rehearsal. We were all tired and we just wanted to not do anything but veg out and watch some mind numbing TV. 

I don’t even remember what we were watching, it was probably America’s Funniest Home Videos, or Survivor. All I know is, after a while of us watching, something happened to the TV signal and it turned to Static. My dad asked if I could take a look and see if something got unplugged. I got up from the couch and took a look at the TV and it didn’t look like anything out of the ordinary had happened to it. I went back to sit down, not really paying attention to my surroundings. I said, “Well I don’t see anything wrong with it, maybe we could just play some games or call…,” that's when I saw that all members of my family were staring at me with these horrible faces. They were grinning from ear to ear, and their eyes were so wide I thought they might pop out of their sockets. Their faces made me jump, and I said, “What’s wrong? Why are you smiling like that?,”...no answer. That’s when their eyes started to trickle, a red viscous liquid oozing from their horrible eyes. Oh God, it was blood. I was frozen, I couldn’t move. I was so frozen that when I felt something fall on my face it snapped me out of my frozen stupor. Red liquid had fallen on my cheek. I looked up and saw that the ceiling was…bleeding. What the hell? The ceiling started to rain with blood and I was soon covered in it, gagging with blood. The warm thick liquid running down my throat. It was downpouring blood in our living room. I coughed and screamed at my family, “STOP SMILING AT ME! HELP ME PLEASE!,” but they just continued to stare. The TV was still static, and the static was tormenting me with its continual noise.

“GOD HELP ME!,” I was coughing and gagging, that's when my family got up and crept towards me. Then all of them in unison and with these horribly deep and distorted voices said, “Nothing can help you now,” I closed my eyes and begged them to stop. I just kept begging but their ungodly voices just grew louder, “NOTHING CAN HELP YOU NOW.”

I woke up with a start, I screamed, I knew I had, and I was sweating profusely. My family raced in the living room to see what was the matter. I told them I had a nightmare. My Mom sat next to me and said, “Well it's all over now, let’s settle in and watch some TV,” I didn’t want to watch TV, the dream had felt so real, but I pushed the fear away and told myself that it was nothing. We settled in and started to watch some stupid reality show about God knows what. That's when I heard that unforgettable noise emit from the TV. TV static, no signal appeared on the screen. And that's when the nightmare truly began.
