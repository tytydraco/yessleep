My grandmother lives alone.  It’s been that way since my grandpa died back when I was seventeen, and she’s always done fine taking care of herself.  At eighty-seven, she has her shit together better than my parents do, than I do, and I’ve never seen signs of her slipping into getting senile or Alzheimer’s or whatever.

At least that’s what I always thought until six months ago when I was back home.  Dad was having back surgery and I flew back for a few days to be around and help out, though everything went smooth enough that I wasn’t really needed after all.  By my last full day with my parents I was getting bored and decided to go visit my grandmother—she was an hour away, but that was still way closer than when I lived two states over.

Mom warned me before I went—she’s starting to get strange, she said.  Not to the point that they thought she was unsafe, but weird.  When I asked her what she meant, she just shrugged and gave me a smile.  “You’ll see.  Maybe.  Or maybe she’ll just be normal today.”

Driving up the interstate, I felt my stomach knotting a little.  I wanted to see her, I did, but I was worried that what I’d find was some crazy old woman where my sweet grandmother used to be.  I felt selfish for having those reservations, but it didn’t change how I felt.

Still, Mom had told her I was coming and she was apparently happy I was visiting, so that was a good sign.  And driving down the streets leading to her house, I couldn’t help but get swept up a bit in the nostalgia of days I’d spent there growing up.  The neighborhood was much the same, if older and a bit run down in spots.  Stores had changed or closed, and some of the houses had for sale signs out front before you turned onto her street.

Everything was different after that turn, though.  All the lawns were mowed, and most of the houses look freshly painted or renovated.  Even some of the driveways looked newly paved.  It made my grandmother’s house, which was in good shape overall, look a bit faded and shabby by comparison.

The old woman sitting on the front porch looked a bit faded herself.  It had been a couple of years since I’d seen her in person, and while she still looked like herself, she seemed paler and thinner than I remembered.  Smaller.  Her hair was a wispy cloud of silvery gray floating around a face that looked tired until you saw her eyes.  I felt myself smiling and tearing up a little as I met those eyes, still as sharp and bright as ever when she let out a small, delighted laugh.

I went onto the porch as she stood up slowly to hug me.  “It’s good to see you, girl.”

Pulling back, I grinned at her.  “It’s good to see you too.  Sorry it’s been so long.”  I felt pressure against my shins and heard a grunting growl.  Looking down, I saw her little mixed terrier, Junie, staring up at me with dark, sad eyes.  “I missed you too, Junie.”  She started wagging her tail even as her master was waving away my apology.

“You’re young and living your life.  Don’t ever apologize for that.  Just glad to see you, is all.  Come on inside.”

\*\*\*\*

She had made sandwiches and baked a pie, and by the time we got done with lunch, I felt like I might pass out or puke from all I’d eaten.  Going into the living room, I flopped down on the sofa as I pondered what else to tell her now that I’d caught her up on my job and how l liked living in a big city.  It was then that it struck me how little she’d told me about how she was doing, even when I asked.  She seemed fully herself, but she was vague and brief whenever I asked about something, and I didn’t want her to feel like I wasn’t interested in whatever she had going on.

“You still part of that book preservation club thing?”

My grandmother raised an eyebrow and laughed.  “At the library?  Yes, though it’s hardly worth the effort anymore.  The last few years, bored soccer moms are coming in and trying to take it over.  They want to make it about parties and socializing instead of saving old books.”  She snickered.  “A couple of them probably pray for me to die at least once a week.”

I snorted.  “I doubt that.”

She grinned.  “Oh, I wouldn’t.  I have a lot of time on my hands, and I can be a stubborn old cunt when I’m of the mind to be.”

I was taking a sip of ginger ale when she said the last, and some of it shot out my nose.  “What the…”

She flapped her hand at me.  “Oh save me your shock and piety.  I’m old, not a nun.  I have the internet.  And I know your generation sees and does way worse than saying cunt.”

I was crying with laughter now.  “Stop!  Please just stop saying it.”

“Cunty cunt cunt…There.  I think it’s out of my system, at least for now.”

Wiping my eyes, I shook my head at her.  “Fuck me.”

Her eyes narrowed.  “Language, young lady.”  Then she broke into a smile.  “So what else have you been up to?”

I shrugged.  “Nothing too much.  Mainly working.  But what about you?  Aside from pissing people off about old books, how’ve things been around here?  The neighborhood still seems nice.”

The smile fell off her face so fast that I barely held in a gasp.  Was something wrong?  Was she getting sick or…

“The neighborhood isn’t nice at all, anymore.  It’s been taken over.”

I felt my stomach tighten.  I didn’t know what she was talking about, but I really hoped she wasn’t about to go into some prejudiced old person rant.  I’d never thought she was like that, but maybe that’s what Mom had been talking about.  Wincing inside a little, I forced myself to ask the question.

“What do you mean, ‘taken over’?”

She stared at me for several moments and then shook her head.  “No, there’s no need.  No need to ruin this nice visit, especially when you’ll just think I’m crazy.”

I frowned at her.  “No, I won’t.  What do you mean?”

\*\*\*\*

I’ve lived in this neighborhood for over fifty years.  Harris and I built this house right after getting married—back then it was only the second house on the street.  We raised your mother and your uncles in this house, and then you came and stayed with us plenty of times when you were old enough.  My Harris…well, when his heart gave out in the middle of the night, it was back in that bedroom where we’ve slept most of our lives.

I don’t…I don’t say any of that to be overly sentimental, though I know I’m prone to that more and more as I get older.  But no, I say it in part to explain why this place—this house, yes, but also this neighborhood—mean so much to me.  It makes me protective of it, and unwilling to leave.

But more than that, I want you to understand that I don’t just love this neighborhood.  I know it.  I’ve seen dozens of families come and go up and down this street over the years, and with very few exceptions, I’ve made a point to become their friend.  When they leave, I still keep in touch with most of them, and those that stay—well, no one has been here as long as I have I don’t suppose, but I’ve known some of these people for twenty or thirty years.

Not just them as friends, but by what I see of them day-to-day.  Their habits.  Their comings and goings.  For years I’ve made watching this street a passing hobby of mine, and there’s little that goes on that I don’t notice.

Still, I’m not sure when it started.  It’s a subtle thing, especially nowadays.  People spend so much time inside and isolated, after all.  When we were younger, there’d regularly be neighborhood barbeques or potlucks—just excuses to get together more than anything—but that doesn’t really happen anymore, and that’s not what I’m talking about.

No, I think it started with the Rosens not coming out of their house anymore.

They’ve been here for almost thirty years, and I know she’s been in bad health the last few, but that has never stopped either of them from futzing around in their yard in the morning and walking around the neighborhood in the evening.  When I first noticed all that had stopped, I thought maybe they were sick.  I tried calling once, but I got their answering machine.

When it hit me a few days later that I still hadn’t heard back from them or seen them, I decided to go over and check for myself.  I knocked on the door, and I could hear something moving on the other side—they have wood floors and I could hear them squeaking, like weight was shifting as someone walked on them.  Still, no one came to the door.  I wound up leaving a little note, saying I hoped they were okay and to let me know if they needed anything.

I thought about calling again, or even asking the police to do a check on them, but I held off.  I hadn’t seen any signs of a problem from my limited vantage point, and there were no signs of piled up mail as there might be if they were in the hospital or laying dead or injured in the house.  No, I told myself, I was being a stereotypical old busybody, and I needed to leave well-enough alone.

That’s when the family across from me stopped going outside.

The Jeffords are a younger couple with a toddler.  They’d only been over there for three years, but between the child and their busy work schedules, they were in and out all hours of the day.  And suddenly they were nowhere to be seen.

Then it was the Kim family three doors down.

And over time, it’s become the whole street.

I know how that sounds.  An entire neighborhood has just disappeared.  That’s crazy.  It’s also not exactly what I’m saying.  Because they…because something is still there.  Sometimes the cars move or are gone.  Not nearly as much as usual, but then only a few of these houses are owned by younger people that still work.

Still...the Jeffords?  He works as an engineer at the base and she’s a dermatologist.  Not jobs you can do from home, and one of their cars is almost always there now.  There are other examples too, but you get the point.  Things were getting strange—it was like returning to how things were during the COVID lockdown in many ways, but even then we would see each other outside sometimes and talk at a distance.

Now?  There are signs of life—the repairs and upkeep, the cars moving some, that kind of thing—but I almost never see the people anymore.  I wasn’t the only one that noticed it, by the way, but the others disappeared too.  After nearly six months, I’d gone from mildly curious to concerned to truly afraid.  My attempts at making contact—phone calls, texts, notes, going and knocking on their doors—had all gone unanswered, and I was far past the point of thinking it was a coincidence or that something wasn’t going on.

Still, I was slow to act because I was afraid.  Afraid of calling attention to myself, afraid of what might happen if I made too much of a fuss, afraid of looking crazy if there was some innocent explanation for it all.  For several weeks I just tried to ignore it, but my conscience kept whispering that I was being a coward.  That these were my friends and they needed my help.

So I called the police.  I didn’t want it linked back to me, so I went to the store and bought a couple of those disposable cell phones.  I used them to call 911 a few days apart—first to check on a family down on the other end of the street—they were always running around like the Jeffords, and I hadn’t seen them in over a month.  The second call was for the Rosens.  Both times I refused to give my name, but I asked for them to check in on them, which they did.

I lived too far and at the wrong angle to see anything but distant flashing lights when they checked on that first family, but I could clearly see when they went to the Rosen house.  No lights this time, but I watched through my blinds as two officers got out and went up to their front door and knocked.  There was no answer at first, and after another round of knocks I was starting to wonder if they would actually try to go inside or just report it as…

The door opened.  The afternoon was growing dark and they were some distance away, but I could see a person that looked like Anna Rosen standing in the doorway, gesturing as she talked to the officers.  It should have made me feel better, but it didn’t.  Even at a distance, seeing that figure in the door made my stomach clench, though it wasn’t until an hour later that I understood why.

Just after sunset, my doorbell rang.  Looking through the peephole, I saw Anna Rosen’s face staring back at me.  Sucking in a breath, I forced on a smile and opened the door.

“Hey Anna!  This is a surprise.”

The woman’s face split into a version of my own smile as she gave a nodding laugh.  “Yes, it’s been too long, hasn’t it?  We’ve been meaning to come by or call—we got your sweet note, by the way.  Just…well, you know how it is.  Time gets away from us all, I guess.”

“Um…yes, yes it does.  Well, I’m so glad to see you’re doing okay.  Arthur is too, I hope?”  I was trying to keep the tremor out of my voice, and thought I was mostly succeeding, though every second looking at her made me feel like something was crawling up my throat, trying to escape in a scream.

The thing nodded again.  “Oh, yes.  He putters around the house constantly, and frankly it gets on my nerves, but I don’t know what I’d do without him.”

I swallowed.  “Good.  Um, I just…well, I saw there were police over there today and wanted to make sure one of you hadn’t had an accident or something.”

Her lips twitched slightly.  “Yes, I guess someone felt they needed to check on us.  I wish I knew who.  Just so I could properly thank them for being so sweet.”  Her eyes drifted off for a second before coming back to me.  “But don’t you worry about us, okay?  Everything is as right as rain, and I promise that, before you know it, we’ll be back over here visiting you.”

I had to fight from slamming the door shut then, but I forced myself to say I looked forward to seeing her again.  She gave a little laugh as she turned and started back the way she had came.  I watched for several seconds, oddly fascinated as I watched her cross my yard and head back to the Rosen’s house, every step just reinforcing what I’d known from the moment I’d opened the door.

That wasn’t Anna Rosen.

It looked like her, sure.  The face was very similar, as was the body.  Height, voice, all of it, were close enough that most people would meet the thing on my porch and think it was just an attractive older lady.  But for someone that had known her as long as I had, everything was slightly off.  Her skin looked different—similar, yes, but it hung differently and was paler and slightly sallow.  Her voice was almost the same, but it was deeper than I remembered it, and certain words carried the rounded edges of an accent that Anna didn’t have.

But the most obvious thing was how she moved—walking, of course, but also her expressions and her gestures.  My first confused thought when I opened the door was that this was Anna’s sister, but as we talked, a new and terrifying thought quickly formed:  It was something trying to pretend like it was Anna.  And the fact that it was doing such a good job just made me more afraid.

\*\*\*\*

I stared at my grandmother.  “So what, you think someone did something to your neighbor and now is impersonating them?  How?  And even if they could, why?”

Her troubled expression darkened slightly as her brows furrowed.  “I don’t know why or how.  I don’t know much beyond that it’s clearly happening.”

Shaking my head, I leaned forward as I gave her a frown.  “How do you know she just wasn’t sick and looked and sounded a bit different?”

My grandmother laughed bitterly.  “Because it’s not just her.  It’s all of them.”

“Everyone?  Except for you?”

She sighed.  “Yes, I know how it sounds.  I knew this was a mistake.”

“No!  No, I’m not saying you’re crazy.  But I don’t understand yet.  How do you know it’s all of them?  Because you haven’t been seeing them?”

Raising her eyebrows, she went on.  “Not just because everyone started disappearing.  But because of how they reappeared.  After the thing that looked like Anna came to visit, I started devoting all my time to watching the neighborhood—both trying to understand what was happening and to watch out for any unwanted visitors coming my way.  And do you know what I saw?”

“What?”

“People.  I’d look out and see the Jeffords coming and going, or the Kims pushing a stroller down the street.  Not all the time, but way more than I had been seeing before.  Of course, I knew what it was.”

“What what was?”

“This change where people were back outside again.”  I could hear the heat of anger in her voice as she continued.  “It was all a show.  All for me.  To fool me into thinking things were still normal until they decided to come and collect me.”

“What?  Why do you think that?”

Her smile was cold.  “Because there’s only ever two of them.  This has been going on for weeks now—I honestly thought they would have gotten me before now, but I don’t understand anything they do.  What I do know is that out of this entire neighborhood, you will never see more than two people out at the same time.  Maybe together or opposite ends of the street, but it will always only be two people or less.  It’s like…”  She swallowed.  “It’s like there’s only two of them and they’re having to change costumes to look like there’s more.  Just to what?  Confuse me?  Pacify me?  Or just because they think it’s fun?”  My grandmother had been staring down at her hands while she spoke, but now she looked back up to me.  “What happens when they get bored of it?”

I sat staring back at her, unsure of what to do or say.  Finally, I just asked her if she felt safe there or like she needed to come home with me.

Her laughter had some warmth this time.  “No, honey, though I appreciate the thought.  Safe or not, this is my home.  I’m not going to be run from it if I can help it.”  She reached out and plucked a small silver revolver from under the sofa cushion beside her.  “And if they do try to come in on me, I won’t go so easily.”

My eyes widened.  “Jesus!  Be careful with that.”

She grinned.  “Don’t worry.  I’m old, not a fool.  I’ve used guns since I was a little girl, and I know which end shoots.”  Her smile quickly fell away.  “And I do thank you for listening to me.  Not because I’m asking for help, but because it’s good to have someone actually listen instead of just nodding along until they can interrupt.  You’re a sweet girl.”

Tearing up a little, I went over to her and gave her a hug.  “I…I don’t know that I believe all that you’re saying, but I know it’s been hard to go through, and I’m sorry for it.”  I forced a chuckle.  “And I do kind of hope you’re crazy, because that sounds terrifying.”

She laughed in my ear softly.  “I’ve thought the same thing.  Senility would be better than body snatchers, right?  But I don’t think it’s as easy as all that.  And…well, you need to get going.  It’ll be dark in half an hour, and I want you well away from here.”
