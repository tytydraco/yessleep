I keep repeating it in my mind over and over again, that whole night everything that happened every action that I took, and words I said. It plays over and over again up until when I met her, then it all went blank. Hell, I can't even remember her name just that she was a brunette and had on a white shirt... Hell, that's all I know. I know I'm rambling a slight bit so let me give some backstory up until this point I shouldn't have any trouble explaining this.

Alright, John and Calvin my two good friends and I had planned out a night out. Hell, we don't ever go anywhere, and our friendship was held together by the fact that we had went to high school together. So it was John who first suggested that we should just go out and have some fun and Calvin and I were like, "Why the hell not." I mean shit the last time I had went to a bar was at least a year before this and I will admit I didn't really have a great time, not really for me. But, with having some friends to go with this time I felt that this time it could be different.

Arriving to the bar around eight, John and Calvin were already there talking away, and making my way over to them I quietly placed my hands on Calvin scaring the shit out of him almost causing him to spill his drink all over him. I laughed, and so did John but Calvin was just relieved that his drink didn't ruin his shirt. Taking my seat you can fill in with your imagination on what we talked about none of it is important. But, around an hour later John pointed out some girls that were sitting across the bar and with that we started to talk about them you know just some slight talk and with that it led to me losing some stupid ass game of rock paper scissors and because of that I had to go over and talk to one of them.

First, let me just say that I ain't no lady's man and my friends they knew that and they were looking to catch a laugh. So, preparing myself I stood up and doing my best not to think about it I walked over to them and that's when I saw her, I can't remember what any of the other women looked like except for the brunette, hell I can't even remember her face. And just like that I was out and I woke up. Waking up I was immediately in a whole lot of pain and hell I couldn't move and I couldn't open my damn eyes it was so damn bright. But when I did get my eyes open I saw that I was laying outside in the middle of the damn road butt ass naked in the middle of nowhere. I couldn't move that good because my whole damn body felt battered and the worst of the pain came from my abdominal area and looking down there I saw a long cut with stitches going from around my stomach area and to my back.

Many, many painful minutes later I finally made it to my feet and just a little ways down the road was a small house up on the hillside and I made it there rung the doorbell and I just collapsed and next thing I woke up in the hospital. Some talking from the doctor I was informed that one of my kidneys had been stolen. The doctors said that they were going to keep me for a few days and make sure that I would be okay and with that some officers showed up and I told them all I remembered and that wasn't much to go off of. To make it worse the bar didn't have any cameras and neither did any nearby places so that only made it worse. John and Calvin they were questioned and all they could remember was me telling them that I was going to be going with the brunette. Neither of them never gave her a good look either and only thought that I was going to go and, "have a good night" I don't blame them though and we're still pretty good friends two years later. And I'm doing alright and you can best believe I've never set foot back into that bar. Be careful yall, I should have just walked away... Goddamn rock paper and scissors.
