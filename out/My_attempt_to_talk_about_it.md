Hey everyone, my therapist inspired me to start writing some of my experiences down and to share them with others. I know it’s cliche, but I felt not very genuine not mentioning it. I’m not sure I could share these stories with my family, so I figured I’d try online. This community seems to be really receptive of other posters and some strange stuff. I’m not sure I’m a writer so apologies if it’s not a good read. Figured I’d just start with the first experience I had.

I was 14-15 in 1999. That winter my friends decided we needed to sneak out more. I figured that’s a good idea. Always felt I didn’t enjoy the snow as much as I should have. I was never good at sneaking out of my parents house. My nerves were bad, I’m not sure what they would have done if they caught me. They were soft when they should have been hard and hard when they should have been soft. Sorry kind of personal.

One Thursday we decided we needed to go to Three Ushers park at 2:00 am. For really no good reason. We were too cool to play on the playground, and no one would be there. None of us would say the real reason we went there. We were scared of getting caught and this park was in a richer area with less cops. As tough as a freshman can get.

So at around 1:30 I get all my winter clothes on, sneaking out to the living room to get my boots. The back door made the worst noise when I opened it, and got ready to hear my Dad asking me “Buddy, what the hell are you doing?” Nothing Dad, just going to walk around in the snow, at night, for no reason. At least I’ll be with pals! Nothing happened though, his voice never came. I made it. 

Outside it was cold, terribly cold. The sky was pure white tinted with the purple of the light pollution. It was snowing, big slow snowflakes that clumped together. There was barely any sounds, no cars, no animals just the wind and crunch of snow. It took me about 30 minutes to trudge my way to the park.

I went straight to the tree where we said we’d meet. It was a huge maple tree in the middle of what was a meadow in the summer. That night it was just surrounded by hard snow. It was covered in dunes and drifts. The real reason it was a great meeting spot is because the tree was basically cut in two by lightning sometime in the 80’s. It was a cool tree. I was the first one there. Always was the first one there. I lived a little bit closer than the rest of my friends.

So I waited, and waited, and of course no one showed up. Couldn’t be too angry, because they probably just all got caught. Bad luck. I was bummed but then I heard the hoot of an owl. I wouldn’t admit it as a high schooler, but I really liked birds (still do). I heard it from where the tree had split in half. I was a little too close to see anything where I was. As I backed up the tree came more and more into view, and I saw a beautiful snow owl. As white as the sky and the snow. 

Its eyes moved to look at me, making sure I wasn’t scary or tasty. I guess I wasn’t either. It hooted some more and I really got lost in it. The hoots morphed into a very clear “Who?” It was getting louder and louder and sounding more and more like my dad and more and more like mom. Both of them. “WHO!? WHO!? WHO!?”

It felt like I was in sleep paralysis. I couldn’t force my body to move, and whenever I tried to close my eyes I could see right through them. My head wouldn’t look away. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and I felt my stomach lurch like on a roller coaster. The cold wind was blowing right into my eyes and making them very teary (which would quickly freeze). The snowflakes were beginning to gather on my eyelashes.

The owl’s wings spread as my parents voice continued to scream “WHO!?” It started twisting in the air and floating, it looked like its body was split in half and circling itself. It’s wings grew larger and two human bodies starting spinning around together. Connected and apart and looking exactly like my parents. They were vomiting a thin black liquid that fell back on them. Spinning and spinning around until they were like television snow. “WHO!? WHO!?”

In my head I remember trying so hard not to answer, not to give them my name. It didn’t seem like the right thing to do. It was tougher as their spinning got faster and more distorted. Then what was left glowed bright, like how bright lights show up on VHS. Everything looked like it was caught in a nuclear blast. I couldn’t take it anymore, and told it my name. The light ended immediately, and my eyes tried to adjust to the dark but could only see the left over light while I blinked my eyes (not sure how to describe this, like when you look directly a bright light and close your eyes).

“WE ARE HERE! WE ARE HERE! WE ARE HERE!”

It’s voice was no longer my parents but like a computer, 1000 computers screaming. It rang like microphone feedback. It was pure static that  slowly started making sense.

“DO NOT BE AFRAID! DO NOT BE AFRAID! WE ARE YOUR MOTHER! WE ARE YOUR FATHER! WE ARE HERE!”

When my brain started working again I realized I was levitating too. Slowly I started turning upside down. Nauseatingly slow. I kept spinning around and around as it shouted at me. The blood flowing to my head and back to my feet. 

“WE OFFER OUR HAND! WE OFFER OUR HAND! WE DON’T WANT TO BE ALONE! WE CAN’T BE ALONE!”

I felt something bubbling up from my stomach. It came slowly up my esophagus. It was sticky and slimy and unexplainable. I couldn’t breathe and felt my lungs burn. It slowly started pouring on me as it came out of my mouth and I could see it fall in front of my eyes when I was upside down. A thin oily black liquid. Just like what it had been vomiting earlier. That made me more sick.

“WE CAN’T BE ALONE! WE WON’T BE ALONE!”

It’s voice became frantic and went back to non word static and microphone feedback. It’s shape started compressing itself as it shrieked. 

I could feel the vomit stopping, and my eyes shut tight immediately after I saw it cease to exist. Then I went tumbling through the air. 15 feet at least. I was laying in a crater made by my fall. 

My watch started beeping (it beeped at the top of every hour). It was 3:00 AM already. I was in complete shock. I didn’t move until my watch beeped again at 4:00 am. I got up and started walking home. About three blocks from my house my mom was driving around. I wasn’t scared anymore, I wanted her to find me. I wanted her to get me warm, I even wanted her to yell at me. In her normal voice. She braked hard when she saw me and got out of the van.

She was yell/whispering at me. She was as mad as it gets. She said she was worried. Worried I’d got buried under the snow or fell into the river or got kidnapped or smoked pot. She said she got up right before three and didn’t see me and starting praying. I didn’t believe her though.

Kind of a relief getting that off my chest. Thanks for reading. Wishing you the best this winter.
