“There was a man in my closet today, Mommy.”

My eyes nearly popped out of my skull when Sarah said that to me. “You mean like Mr. Rags or Barnie, right?” I asked, motioning to her plushies. 

“No, Mommy. A real man. He was nice. He said not to tell you, though.” 

A cold dread settled into the pit of my stomach. “This man, is he still there?” 

Sarah shook her head, much to my relief. “No. He left. But he said he’ll come back tomorrow.” 

“When was this? What did he look like? Are you *sure* someone was here? Sarah, this is serious.” 

“Mommy, you’re scaring me,” she said, pulling the covers up to her face.

I took a deep breath. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to get so worked up. Can you describe the man to Mommy, Sweetheart?” 

“He’s tall. *Really* tall. And he has a suit. And - oh! He doesn’t have a face.” 

That last statement made my blood turn to ice - at least until the realization hit me. This must have been an imaginary friend. Sarah *was* at that age where kids drum up wacky characters like that. 

“Well, Sweetie, this man sounds very interesting. I’d love to meet him sometime.” 

Her face lit up. “Yay! He said he *really* wants to meet you.”

Something about that unsettled me. Even so, I chalked it up to my daughter’s overactive imagination. 

“I’m sure he is. Now, get some sleep. I love you.”

“Love you too.” 

The second Sarah’s door clicked shut behind, I made a beeline for the kitchen. Mommy needed a glass of wine - or five. 

\*\*\*

Sarah’s encounters with the faceless man happened more and more frequently. At least, according to her. 

First, she’d seen him at recess. Next, he was waving to her on the street corner. Then he was in her room at night, singing her a lullaby. 

That one freaked me out. Sarah’s imaginary friend sounded like a major creep. 

As I would come to find out, I wasn’t wrong. 

Up until a couple days ago, I hadn’t put too much stock into the man with no face. He was just a character. A figment of a child’s creative thoughts. At least, that’s what I believed. I was tucking Sarah into bed again, when she told me something that changed everything. 

“Mommy, the man with no face said he wants you to have this. He said he’ll see you soon,” she stated, plucking a rose from her bedside table and handing it to me. 

“Well, isn’t that sweet of him,” I said, giving it a sniff. “I can’t wait.” 

“He can’t wait to meet you too. Oh yeah! And he told me to say he likes the color green.” 

I grinned at her. This wasn’t so freaky anymore. Sarah was just making things up. “Isn’t that nice? Get some shuteye, Sweetheart. Mommy loves you.” 

“I love you too, Mommy.” 

The surge of panic didn’t hit me right away. It wasn’t until I was sitting on the couch, going over the conversation again in my head that all the color drained from my face. 

I had worn green to work that day. 

But Sarah couldn’t have known that. I was still in bed when she left for the bus, and I changed clothes before she got back. 

Suddenly, the faceless man didn’t seem so innocuous after all. 

\*\*\*

The next day, I decided to burn some PTO. I could use a day to myself. 

I saw Sarah off to the bus, then headed to the kitchen to brew my coffee. The second I stepped onto the tile, I froze. 

There was a little scrap of paper lying on the counter. I could have sworn that it wasn't there before. 

With trembling hands, I picked it up and read the note it contained. 

*I’m thrilled to make your acquaintance.*

My breath hitched, and I had to grab a chair to keep my balance. 

That was not Sarah’s handwriting. 

I didn’t want to spend another second in that house. I grabbed a book and planned to be out for the day. I had to clear my head. 

I pulled my bathrobe tighter as I reached for the door handle to my closet. A sudden chill ran through me, and an uneasy feeling settled in my gut. My intuition screamed at me not to open that door. 

I slowly backed away, fear clawing at my insides. But then, reality sank in. 

*What am I so scared of? There’s nothing there.*

I decided to ignore my nagging fears, and I opened the closet. I blindly reached for a blouse when - was that… something solid? Why was it warm? 

I glanced up and immediately fell back. 

There he was. The man with no face. 

My mouth fell open in shock. Sarah was right. 

Where the man’s facial features should have been, there was just… nothing. Smooth skin over the areas where eyes and a nose and a mouth should be. It was the most disturbing thing I’d ever seen - Yet I couldn’t look away. 

The man didn’t utter a word. I don’t know if he even could. Instead, he did something much worse. 

He tipped his head downward. He didn’t need eyes for me to know that he was glaring at me. 

I doubled over in pain as a blinding wave of distortion overtook my mind. It hurt - like a migraine dialed up to eleven. I had never felt such all-encompassing agony. 

And then I heard it. Above the static roaring in my head, there was a voice. A more sinister voice than I could have ever imagined. 

*You are mine. And so is she.* 

Afterward, I was hit with another debilitating shockwave of pain. I couldn’t even scream. My vision faded. 

The last thing I remember is the faceless man standing over me before everything turned to black. 

\*\*\*

I awoke a little past noon in a puddle of congealed vomit. The man with no face was gone. 

I don’t know what he wants with me or my daughter, but I am terrified. As much as I want to, I can’t pass this off as a hallucination or a stress-induced episode. Because in the faceless man’s place was a wilted rose and a note in that same awful handwriting.
