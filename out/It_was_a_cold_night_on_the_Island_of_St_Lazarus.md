A faint breeze coasted across the decrepit sands, carrying with it a pale wispy fog--a yearning traveler. A man dressed in rugged, hole spattered clothing leaned against a sea speckled rail assessing the angry waves with a resigned tired cast. A lonely flash shown across the cold pier as he lights a cigarette. He takes a long disdainful draw--something he has done hundreds of times. His mind-regretful.



Regretful of what? Time-lost? Missed opportunity? This damnable world that was thrust upon us? This is for him to know.



His thoughts are interrupted by the slow even-paced footsteps creeping from behind. Another man, resembling a boat winch--hunched over as if his form had been snapped and bent by a malevolent giant. Gleeful eyes pierced across the pier from under a spattering of greasy locks. "A little late for you to be up isn't it Captain? You have an early morning ahead of you with the fishing and such.", the crooked man spits, gesturing toward the clashing waves with an elongated hand.

The Captain of the vessel Pandora turns drawing again from his half defeated cigarette, cherishing the last of its toxic fumes, before flicking the remnants into the shallows.

As his tired eyes locked onto the branch-shaped man roughly six meters away the Captain mutters, "I figured something would come. You don't come back from seeing something like that without some of it coming back with you". Suddenly the Captain's blood ran cold as he beheld the figure before him. "You're one of them aren't you? Not you! That thing has deep roots...how couldn't I see it? STAY BACK! DON'T COME ANY CLOSER!"

"Ya know. You really shouldn't litter, there's no telling what those chemicals could do to the fish. Or the crabs!" He replies, making a pinching motion with his skeletal appendage.

While the comment was humorous the bent man had no humor to him. His eyes were filled with an endless hungry miasma. Staring at the captain with a hunger that no mortal man could begin to comprehend. That hunger longed for the captain, that much was plain, but there was more to it than that. Much more. Staring into those hungering corpse-like eyes the captain saw the moment of his own death. He saw the death of the island. Like an unimaginable horror from the dark pulling down an entire ship, then nothing...like neither ever was.

The Captain realized with a shock he must have been dreaming for the bent man was now closer, roughly halfway to him. He also now held in his bony claw a rusted blade --it was a crude thing, something meant to gut fish but should've been replaced ages ago, worn down to a blotchy brown needle.

The captain felt cold, not from the night air or the sea breeze that occasionally caressed his cheek, from the fear. The fear of that crude thing and its bearer. For the bearer of that thing meant to gut fish, was known to him. A friend he had long missed. This now bent thing showed no sign of kinship, only an aura of cold cruelty that he knew would be his death.

The Captain was mid-turn when he felt its sting. 

He was but a fish to this hunger that meant to devour him. As the life-blood flowed out onto the pier, already soaking into the dried dead wood, the sound of a faint thud and slow even-paced footsteps were swallowed by the crashing waves. As if they never were.
