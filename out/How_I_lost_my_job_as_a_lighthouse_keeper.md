I used to be a lighthouse keeper, back when I was younger. The job was harsh and solitary, as you’d expect. I never stayed more than two weeks before someone else took over. Any longer, and you’d lose your mind.

Most of my days were entirely uneventful. Reading, watching the ocean, making sure everything worked as it should. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

However, what happened during my last mission was different. I spent years trying to make sense of it. Now, I think I understand.

I was sent to an old lighthouse off the coast. It was built on a grim rock surrounded by the sea. Its ominous grey tower seemed to defy the waves. 

I had to stay there for five days. It was quite a long time to spend alone. Your mind starts to wander, and you become more… imaginative. Or so I thought. 

The first two days went by unnoticed. The skies were clear, and I was bored out of my mind. I had brought a book to keep myself busy. Otherwise, all I had to do was light the lamp at dusk, and check that nothing was wrong with it during the night. That was it. Not much else to do. 

On the third day, however, the weather got worse. A storm was on its way. 

Do you know what we call the lighthouses off the coast? “Hells”. We call them hells. Because when the storm hits you, all you can do is pray. Pray that the stones are stronger than the waves crashing onto the tower. Pray that the winds don’t blow the roof over your head. The screams of the sea are so loud that, if you try to speak, you can’t even hear your own voice. 

But this time, the screams were different. It started as usual - strong winds, high waves, pouring rain. As the wind rose, however, something changed. The gusts sounded less and less natural. I tried to ignore it at first. But it was unmistakable. It sounded like countless dead voices fused into a gruesome choir. As the night grew darker, as the storm swelled, the wind began to speak. I thought I was hallucinating at first, I thought my loneliness was playing on my nerves.

But I heard it clearly. In the howling of the storm, it was, in fact, the only thing I could hear. 

It was singing my name. Over and over, in a thousand different voices. It was calling for me. 

I swallowed far too many sleeping pills before I finally passed out. 

I woke up the next day disappointed in myself. Me, a man of the sea, born and raised facing the ocean, had let delusional thoughts and false impressions take over me. I wouldn’t let that happen again.

The day was quiet, unlike the previous night. The storm had passed, and timid waves licked the lighthouse’s foundations. I finished my book.

At the end of the day, I went up to the lantern room, to turn the lamp on and watch the sunset. The sight was beautiful. It looked like the ocean was devouring the sun, swallowing its light whole. 

But, as the last rays of sunlight faded, I noticed something strange. Again. A wave, far away. A wave that wasn’t like the others. It was perfectly straight, topped with a thick foam. Among the other waves, it felt unnatural. And it was moving towards me, unlike all the others.

Determined not to let my thoughts get the better of me, I stayed there to watch. Minutes went by as the wave was approaching me at a steady pace. It finally crashed into the rocks underneath. I let out a sigh of relief. 

But my breath stopped, in a gasp of horror. As the waters receded, they left something ashore. A writhing, formless white shape, entirely made of foam. 

The shape started moving. Slowly, it crawled over the rocks, searching for a way inside. It looked vaguely human. 

I was not going to run away. It wasn’t bravery on my end: I had nowhere else to go anyway. So I stayed at the top of the tower, watching the shape from above. I told myself I had the high ground.

The shape stopped at the door. It rose on its hind legs. It looked like a woman, but its features were indistinct. It had no face of its own. It was nothing but foam.

It looked at me. It had no eyes, but I felt it watching me. Something ancient, unnatural, was casting its gaze on my miserable being. Then, a slit appeared where its mouth was supposed to be. The creature was smiling at me. This smile conveyed no warmth, but no malice either. It was an indifferent, contemptuous smile. The monster seemed slightly amused. 

It raised its arm and pointed its long, impossible finger towards me. And then it screamed. A scream so loud it made the previous day’s storm sound like silence. A high, piercing shriek that drilled into my skull. I covered my ears and fell over, as the pain became more and more intense, turning my back to the creature. 

And then it stopped, all of a sudden. Minutes passed. I was still paralyzed in fear. The pain subsided, and I gathered all my courage to stand up and take a look at the shape. 

But it had disappeared. All that was left was a trace of foam where I had last seen it. Right in front of the door. 

I thought of calling for help and leaving. I hesitated, but I convinced myself not to. I was a rational man. I know that being alone can play tricks on your mind. Maybe I had dreamed of the shape, maybe I had mistaken it for something else. Anyway, I only had one day left. Then the boat would come, and I would soon leave hell.

It was a mistake. The last night was the worst of them all. It looked like the sea itself wanted to turn me mad. 

It all began at dusk. At first, the wind. What started as a gentle breeze soon became another storm.  And this time, the storm started to laugh. It was laughing at me, mocking my ludicrous tower in the middle of the ocean.

And then, the waves. Rather than passing by, they started to converge towards the lighthouse, as if they wished to topple me down. As they came closer, my eyes widened. I could see white shapes atop the waves. They looked just like the monster I saw the day before. Twisted and cursed. There were hundreds of them. 

The final straw was the lights. Faint, dim lights that appeared on the horizon. I mistook them for ships at first, when the first three or four appeared. But they grew more numerous. Hundreds, then thousands of impossible lights, all pulsing and dancing in unison, far in the distance. 

I was surrounded. The winds, the waves, the lights, all were wishing for my end. I could feel it. 

In an act of courage, I hurried up the stairs, and turned on the lamp. I thought it would drown out the lights, I thought it would burn the foam. But, to my dismay, it had the opposite effect. All hell broke loose. The shapes followed the beam at an impossible speed. The lights grew blindingly bright and surged towards me. The wind grew stronger, shaking the foundations of the lighthouse. 

I had to make it stop. I did something reckless: I turned the lamp back off. 

And then, suddenly, it all stopped. The lights disappeared, the wind settled, the shapes went back into the ocean where they came from. A thick mist took their place. And then I stayed there, alone, as I cried myself to sleep. 

I was woken up hours later, in the middle of the night, by a crashing sound—metal tearing apart, filling the air with mechanical horror. I stood up and looked around, but the moonlight was too faint, and the fog was too thick for me to see anything. It lasted for one minute, then it stopped. 

And then, I heard them. Screams. Human screams, muffled by the mist. My eyes widened as I came to the realization. A ship had crashed against the reefs surrounding the tower. The unlucky sailors couldn’t have seen them. I had turned off the lights that should have guided them. 

The screams lasted for a while, then one by one, they fell silent, as the waters claimed their souls. A moment of silence followed. The fog thickened around the tower, heavy and unmoving. 

Then the wind rose again. A thin, cold gust slipped through the cracks of the lantern room. It carried with it a sound, faint at first, indistinguishable from the howling air. A woman’s laughter. Distant and drawn out. As if the sea itself had learned to mock me. It faded slowly, leaving only the pounding of my heart, and then silence reclaimed its throne. 

I lost the job, of course. I told them it was mechanical failure from the lighthouse, but that was no excuse: my job was precisely to avoid this. 

I spent the next few years thinking about what had happened. I was afraid to realize it, but there was only one explanation. It had wanted me to turn off the lamp. It had wanted them to die.

To those who read these words, consider my warning. Do not fear the monsters in the sea. Fear the sea itself, for it is the monster. And it feeds on the drowned.
