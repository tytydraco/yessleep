Help please... It's in my room

Hey yeah I'm writing this in a hurry because I don't have much time. I was just sitting in my kitchen making food when the door started shaking. I went and answered it but there was nothing there. Oh boy was I wrong. It slipped in behind me without me noticing. I closed the door and went back to cooking. That's when the tv started to play static. I went and turned it off, but it turned back on. I turned it off and it turned back on this time with a message saying "safe" I unplugged it. It turned back on and kept showing "safe safe safe safe" then... It flashed and said "not safe". I was scared shitless by now and I ran upstairs to where I have my pistol and my room. I ran into my room, slammed the door shut and grabbed my gun. Then my door started shaking. On the other side all I could hear was "safe safe safe safe safe safe safe" then I heard "it" say "not safe" followed by a guttural screech. I dropped my gun and hid under my desk. It broke in. This is where I am now. I think it knows I'm here and I want you to tell my mom and dad I love them. Oh crap it's pulling the de-





I made it. I managed to knock what ever it was down and make it out of my house. None of my neighbours are answering and my phone has no service. I don't think I'm going to survive. 


I made it to a friend's truck. He made me a copy of the keys so I can use it if I need. I heard some sort of screaming from some of the houses on my way over. I'm going to head to the city and try to contact the police.



K so I turned on the radio... And it kept saying... "Safe safe safe safe" "this is not a drill. This is not a drill." " safe safe sa-" then it cut out. I've seen a few of the things on my drive. I don't think they are natural. The have their skin stretched over there very disproportionate gangly limbs. One chased after me galloping on its hands. 


I made it to the city. The police were aware and the city is safe(I think) apparently it was contained to my town. Or so they thought. As I was sitting in one of the cops offices we heard the door shake while the typical "safe safe" was coming from the other side. I didn't make it this time. It grabbed me. I don't want to know what happened. But I woke up in a cave with a gooey red substance everywhere. I'm missing a leg. I think this is where it ends for me. Oh god... This is not how I wanted to die... Bleeding out in a cave of gore in the middle of nowhere while the world is ending outside.... Wish you all the best of luck, remember me. I think I'm becoming one. I can feel my arms stretching. It hurts so bad.

Don't forget if you hear or see anything talk- "safe safe safe safe safe safe sa-"
