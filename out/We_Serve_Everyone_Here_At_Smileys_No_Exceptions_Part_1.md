If you told high school me I’d end up working at a fast food restaurant after college, young me would be pretty upset. I had straight A’s, a nice Ivy League college chosen, and a sweet scholarship. College went even better—I was getting A’s in everything, was popular, and played sports. Everything was going my way... until my accident. Turns out it’s usually a good idea to look both ways before you cross the street.

After a few months in a coma, things weren’t looking great for me. Even after waking up, doctors told me that with the head trauma I experienced, I wouldn’t be able to go back to school. Didn’t stop me from trying, but they were right. That’s a few thousand dollars I won’t get back.

Going back to my hometown, my only option was to look for work. The problem is, no one wants to hire someone who can barely add numbers that go into the double digits. Things were looking rough until something caught my eye—an old tattered paper stapled to a power line that said: “Smileys! Looking for late night worker, no experience necessary!” The bottom of the paper had a cartoon clown grinning wide, with the motto, “We serve everyone with a smile!”

Even though the paper was ancient, they were still hiring, the chipper voice on the phone told me. “We’re always looking to hire here at Smileys! Thanks for your application!” I could practically hear the grin through the phone. “We’ve been desperately needing a late night worker, and you sound like the perfect fit! Come by tomorrow night and we’ll get you trained up for your first shift!”

While walking over for my training, I noticed the restaurant was located pretty far on the edge of town, which is probably why I’d never heard of it. Entering the empty store, I heard a cheerful voice say, “You must be the new hire! So good to meet you!” My boss—who I later found out was named Ryan—was the definition of average. Think of the most regular guy you can think of, and you’re thinking of Ryan. “Let me show you around and tell you a few of the rules!” he said as he ushered me around the counter and into the kitchen.

Overall, training was pretty simple. Thankfully I’d worked a little in a restaurant before, so I was already familiar with the basics—how to cook chicken so it wouldn’t kill anybody, stuff like that. But there were a few things Ryan told me that caught me off guard. Like how, when I’m done in the freezer, I should make sure to lock it and never open it if I hear banging from inside. And if the lights in the lobby start to flicker, I’m supposed to take one of the papers beneath the counter and burn it.

There were a few other things, but I just finished up my shift and can barely keep my eyes open. I’ll update this journal thing later (doctors told me it might help to write down what happened every day to help with my memory or something. They probably explained it, but you know, head trauma, coma—I didn’t think it was important enough to write down).

**Update:**  
Something interesting happened. Who could’ve guessed?

I originally thought the weird rules were some kind of new worker hazing ritual and didn’t take them too seriously. Most shifts are pretty uneventful, with maybe a dozen people coming in on a busy night and barely three on a slow one.

On one of the slower nights, I was sitting in the kitchen (before you restaurant elitists start whining about sitting—I was in a coma for several months, I’m allowed to sit every now and then) when I saw the lights flickering in the lobby. What Ryan told me came to mind, and I chuckled. They weren’t gonna get me this easily.

I ignored it, and the flickering kept going for a few more minutes until suddenly, all the lights turned off. I jumped and slowly stood up, being careful not to bump into anything hot in the kitchen—easier said than done. Turning on my phone’s flashlight, I worked my way to the front counter.

“Very funny guys, you got me, you can turn the lights on,” I nervously said, glancing around. No one responded.

“I get it, I’m new, you have to play pranks on me. Super funny,” I added, frustration starting to surface. Still no response. I walked into the lobby and fumbled for the light switch, flicking it a few times, but the store stayed shrouded in black.

Suddenly, a loud bang came from behind me. It sounded like some pots or pans from the back fell.

“H...h...hello?” stuttered out of my mouth, my knees shaking. I fumbled behind me, hands grasping beneath the counter, looking for the papers and lighter Ryan told me about. While I was never superstitious, in that moment, all my logic and higher-level thinking went out the window. I’ve never been the brave type, and horror movies are a no for me.

My hands found the paper and lighter, and I fumbled to flick it on, barely managing to light it without burning myself. My breathing slowed a little, and I waited anxiously for the lights to turn on. Nothing happened.

I turned around, gazing at what little I could see from the light of the burning paper. Just barely, at the edge of the flame’s glow, was the silhouette of someone—but just as my eyes were about to focus, the paper burned out.

I yelled and ran as fast as I could to the manager’s office, barely avoiding slipping on the greasy floors. Reaching the door and slamming it shut and locking it, I fumbled with my phone and quickly called 911.

No answer.

I called again.

Still no answer.

I leaned against the door and slid down, my legs shaking even more than before. Out of desperation, I called Ryan, a memory bubbling up about calling him if anything went wrong.

“Hello! How’s the shift going, Andrew? Everything going well?” Ryan’s always-cheerful voice said, shocking me with its loudness.

“Ryan, Ryan, please help me! There’s someone in the store—the lights aren’t working—I can’t call the police—” I whispered desperately before getting interrupted.

“Son, did you forget what I told you during training? Burn the paper if the lights flicker,” Ryan said, still cheerful as ever given the circumstance.

“I thought it was a prank. The lights turned off, and I burned the paper and... nothing happened,” I pleaded, hoping he was going to help.

“Well obviously burning the paper after the lights go off isn’t gonna do anything. You have to do it before they turn off. The burning is what scares off Bill from coming in. But once he’s in, burning won’t do anything to him.”

Bill? Ryan never mentioned that. And who would be scared of burning paper? A global warming activist? My mind was desperately looking for answers.

“Now that he’s in the store, he won’t leave without a stern removal. Where are you right now?” Ryan asked.

“The manager’s office,” I whispered, desperately listening for any sounds from the kitchen.

“Good. Look in the drawer, there should be a crucifix in there. Now, I don’t like using it—it tends to upset some of our special guests—but it works as a backup—”

“What do you mean, crucifix?! Am I in a horror movie?!” I whispered aggressively, trying to keep my voice down.

“Well, how else are you supposed to get Bill out?” he said, as if he were answering a basic question like if the sky is blue. “He won’t hurt you—not as long as you have the crucifix. Just hold it out and walk around the kitchen until the lights turn on.” With that, he hung up.

Nervously, I fumbled around the room until I found the crucifix Ryan was talking about. Peeking out the door, I slowly walked into the pitch-black kitchen. Holding the crucifix in one hand and my phone flashlight in the other, I crept through the kitchen. Each step felt like a century. I pleaded silently that Ryan was right.

Approaching the front counter, I heard what sounded like a sharp exhale coming from right in front of me—and suddenly, the lights turned on. My head quickly turned, scanning every part of the kitchen—but found nothing. Whatever had been there... was gone now.

I breathed a sigh of relief and wanted to sink to the floor, but then I heard honking coming from the drive-thru. I looked at the cameras and saw someone sitting at the window, waiting to order.

From that shift on, I started listening to all the rules Ryan told me about. I already wrote down two, but there were some more. If you hear something in the drive-thru headset talking about taking your soul, read the laminated paper by the window. If you find weird pieces of unidentifiable meat mixed in with the fried chicken, fry it in the special fryer and then put it in the bottom of the warmer for our “special guests.”

Speaking of guests, Ryan told me it’s incredibly important that no matter what, we always serve everyone, regardless. They really take the whole “We serve everyone with a smile” to heart.

Now, before you judge me for not quitting on the spot—the job paid *really* well, and it was the only place that would hire me. Ryan promised nothing bad would happen as long as I followed the rules... and honestly, I was curious.

I found out that some of the store’s “regular” visitors usually get a name. I already had the pleasure of meeting Bill, and apparently, there are quite a few more—but Ryan said he’d tell me about them later.

That’s all I can write for now. I try to record some of my other encounters with the visitors of this store whenever I get the displeasure of meeting them.
