Hello fellow Redditors, I am a Reporter for my local paper here In Jim Thorpe, I have just finished writing an article about last year's Christmas Eve  incident. 

This is the manuscript I drafted with the both victims; this is their account of what happened. I have changed some details such as names for their privacy, Please note the account is in Third person To make it a little more comprehensible.

David and Scott are returning from college to visit their family on Christmas Eve. They are on their way to the little town of Jim Thorpe, in Pennsylvania. 

They both promised their parents that they would be home this year as their mother is terminally ill, and with their college being so far away, they had both missed the last couple of Christmases.

David is the oldest child and has always been very close to his family. His brother and him have always been the best of friends. 

Scott is the youngest and he has always been more rebellious, even so he has always admired his older brother. 

Finally reaching an area with reception, Scott switches on the radio. They laugh together as the first song to play was a shitty Christmas song written by some kids they went to school with.

David “Can you believe these guys are still trying to get famous Bro?”

Scott  laughs “No dude I really can’t. you know their song is only on air because Andrew's father owns the radio station!”

David chuckles “True.”

David “Hey bro, while I am thinking about it I gotta ask what did you get mom and dad for Christmas?”

Scott  “I got dad a bottle of Jamersons and mum a collection of her favourite old movies.”

David lets out a laugh “So what? Dad gets drunk and mom is left crying over some chick flicks… God dude, you are funny.”

Scott  Laughs. "Shut up dude…" 

Scott “Well then mr judgmental what did you get for them… huh?”

David “Well, let's see I got a gun cleaning kit for Dad and for Mom I got some comfy sleepwear for her for when she is in the hospital.”

Besides the rumbling of the tires on the road and the sound of the song coming to an end, the car went silent. The second David mentioned the hospital reality returned to them; their mother’s sickness was wearing heavily on the two young men.

Just as David went to speak again, the familiar sound of the radio station's urgent news flash played. The boys quickly let their attention switch to the announcement.

“This Just in, another body has been found in the local forest, meaning the total number of murder victims has risen to 6. Authorities have yet to disclose the name of the most resent victim but believe it to be connected to the recent chain of murders that have hit our small town. Police are due to release a statement at 4pm. We will be sure to cover this as the case unfolds.”

After the announcement the station's regular host comes on. 

The host gasps "Oh My God…”

“I can’t believe someone else has been hurt by this freak… Oh my, am I live…uh Please dear listeners be safe out there. I will see if I can find anything else to report. In the meantime let's get back to those Christmas hits we all enjoy this time of year.”

The sound of an old school Christmas carol comes on. Both David and Scott quickly glance at each other.

David “Shit, did Mom and Dad tell you anything about this….”(He pauses) “the 6 people murdered?”

Scott  “Nah man, nothing. Maybe they didn’t want us to be worried.”

David “Yeah man, maybe. We will be home soon. So, we can check in with them and see what’s going on.”

An hours drive later and the boys pull into their street when the sound of the 4pm news blasts on to the radio.

The reporter “Good Evening, everyone, my name is Stephanie Brown and welcome to the 4 o’clock evening news. Breaking news has just come in. A new murder victim has found this morning, bringing the total death toll to 6. We also have more information on the missing escaped prisoners from county jail and the missing child has been found.”

“The body of a 42-year-old woman named Sarah Parker has been found today. Her body has been located in the forest outside of Jim Thorpe. This marks the 6th victim in 5 days. Her body was found while police were searching the woods for the 3 men who escaped from the County jail this past Saturday. The police have released a statement mentioning the fact this crime seems to mirror the last 5 murders, and they believe that they are related.”

“In related news, the Police believe they have found signs that the 3 prisoners have left Jim Thorpe. They seem to be heading north, following the Lehigh River. This marks the 5th day since the 3 men were last seen. Police believe they have a good chance in finding them for re-arrest.” 

“Lastly, it is good news for the parents of the missing girl, who was found today wandering the streets. She has been missing for 3 weeks and has yet to provide the police with information on where she was. Due to her age the parents and police have asked us not to mention the name of the girl.”

“That is all for today's’…”

David turned off the radio and looked at Scott, both boys Shrugged and exited the car. Scott went to the trunk and pulled out his and David’s bags, tossing David his as he rounded the car.

David “Damn Scott, settle down bro I got expensive shit in there.”

Scott Laughs “Like what your dildo?”  

David Laughing back "Fuck you dude!!”

David walks up to Scott and punches him in the arm.

David “Dick!”

Scott  groans. "OOOOuch," adds mockingly "I am telling Mom!”

Both boys run for the door of their parents’ home. David makes it to the door first. Closing his fist, he slams it against the door several times yelling in his deepest voice.

“OPEN UP! IT’S THE POLICE!”

David is a very stocky man, a trait passed down from his father. While he has been visiting the gym a lot with his college friends. He has always been naturally toned. So, as you could imagine, those slams made the doors shake violently. 

Scott  “David! Now who’s being a dick. You probably just gave dad a heart attack!”

David “Shit… Yeah, you’re probably right.”

The realisation landed across his face. Just as David goes to speak, the door sluggishly opens, and the small pale face of their mother appears from behind.

Their Mother Marian snarls In a sickly voice. “You little shit.”

David “Oh damn Ma! I am so sorry. I thought Pa was home.”

Scott punches David in the arm.

Scott  Jokingly says “You Dick!”

David Hisses “Ouch!”  and jokingly whines "Moooooom Scott hit me!”

Marian speaks sickly and playfully “Just get inside!”

Both boys hurry inside kissing their mother on the cheek as they pass her. Their mother leads them to the living room where she is sitting, watching TV.

David sounding concerned “Hey Ma, how are you feeling today?”

Marian “Yes my dear. Today is one of the better ones. Your father has gone to the Supermarket. We forgot to buy enough food for you both. So, he should be back soon.”

Both boys shrug their shoulders and settle in, waiting for their father to come home. After a few minutes, David moves forward in his chair and faces his mother and asks 

David Asks hesitantly “So Ma…. It seems there are a lot of things going down in Jim Thorpe this year. Isn’t there? Murderers. escaped inmates and missing children. I am glad both you and Pa are safe. Do we know anyone who has been affected?”

Marian “Well. Let me think, it was… the… Blair's daughter who went missing. We all thought it was the convicts who done kidnapped her, I truly thank God she was found. As for the murders none are really connected to our family, just locals from around town. You know the people you would wave to, to be polite.”

David “So, what about the convicts? Is there any details on how they escaped?”

Marian “They haven’t released much information on them. So…. honestly I couldn’t say. But i bet they are the one’s killing folks”

David leans back into his chair.

David “Hmph”

About an hour later, their father comes home with a butt load of groceries. Asking the boys for assistance. Both boys jump up, shake their father’s hand and head outside to bring the groceries in.

After helping their father put away the groceries, they all sat down in the lounge, and started reminiscing about their childhood and updating their parents on their current life. Hours went by and nightfall finally fell. They all said their good nights and went to their bedrooms and fell asleep.

David was awoken to the sound of his bedroom door slowly creaking open. Opening his eyes, he sees a dark figure standing in the doorway. As he went to speak, the figure came into sight. It was Scott. He looked slightly panicked as he entered the room, closing the door behind him and moving David’s dresser in front of the door.

David asks sleepily “What the hell dude?! What’s going on?”

Scott In a whisper “Someone is in the house.”

David Sitting up in his bed “What do you mean bro? What are you talking about?”

Scott  “I went out for a quick smoke to help me get some sleep. When I returned inside there was a man wearing a creepy ass Santa’s mask just staring at me with his head tilted. I didn’t know what to do so I ran in here.”

David jumping out of his bed “Well shit Bro we need to check on Mom and dad.”

David reaches down under his bed and pulls out his baseball equipment bag from his high school days. He threw one of the two metal baseball bats at Scott, hitting him.

Scott He hisses “Ouch! Damn it dude! Warn me first!”

David  “My bad bro.”

David moves the dresser out of the way of his door, and both brothers enter the hallway. Holding the metal baseball bats, they head towards their parent’s room. Walking back-to-back, Scott is the first to enter their parent’s room. As the door opens, the metallic smell of fresh blood permeates their nostrils, almost causing Scott to throw up.

Scott  cries emotionally “Oh MY GOD! Mom!”

As Scott runs into the room, David follows him. The sight in the room was grotesque. There was blood everywhere. The two boys ran to their mother who was lying in her bed. Her throat was slit from ear to ear. Her abdomen had been cut open and her intestines were wrapped around her like tinsel. She had Christmas decorations attached to her organs. The two boys fell to their knees in shocked silence as they came to terms with what they were seeing.

David whispering “My God Mom, who could have done this?” 

Scott, who was never one to control his anger, stands up and charges out the door holding his bat in one hand.

Scott screams angrily “I am going to kill you mother fu…”  the sound of a thud echoes into Davids ear.

The silence was so deafening, a panicked David got up and rushed out the bedroom door.

David starts yelling “Scott! SCOTT!”

David rushes out into the hallway and runs to the stairs leading down to the living room. He looks down at the landing and sees Scott on the first floor on his back, blood pooling from a wound in his stomach. David runs down the stairs and kneels next to his brother.

David “Scott. What the fuck happened?

David pulled off his t-shirt and applied pressure to Scott's wound.

Scott groaning in pain “The prick got me from behind and pushed me over the bannister. He then came down and stabbed me…" He Yells “DAVID!! BEHIND YOU!!”

David turns around just as the attacker swings Scott’s baseball bat at his head. David, noticing the movement, quickly ducks the bat just barely missing him. 

David yelps “THE HELL?!”

David rolls out of the way, as the attacker goes to swing at him for a second time. Scott grabs the attackers leg and holds onto them with all his strength.

Scott  shouts while struggling “RUN! FUCKIN RUN!!!” 

The attacker turns around swinging the bat at Scott’s head. Scott’s body falls limp. The attacker goes to swing a second time but David pounces at him before the bat can land, tackling the attacker. A struggle ensues. David is able to get on top of the assailant and starts punching him until he stops moving. Noticing the attacker has stopped moving David gets off him. He stared down at the intruder. He notices the mask and realises that Scott’s description did not do it justice. It wasn’t  just creepy, it was fucken terrifying. It had solid black eyes, a plastic grin filled with sharp teeth and the fresh blood glistened in the moonlight coming from the front door.

David snapped out of his shocked gaze and went for his phone.

David whispers to himself  “Shit I left my phone up in my room.”

David turns and runs upstairs, gets into his room, finds his phone and calls 911. 

911  “911 What’s your emergency”

David whispering “There is someone in my house, they killed my mom and I think they just killed my brother.”

Finally, when those words leave his mouth, David feels tears start streaming down his face.

911 “What’s the address?”

David “18 Jacobs Ave”

911 “Are there any guns in the house?”

David “Father has a Pistol in his gun safe.”

911 “Are there any more people in the house?”

David “My Fah…"  He is interrupted interrupted,

The Intruder speaks slowly “Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.”

David hears the voice of the intruder behind his door.

David in a panicked whisper “Shit! He is outside of my room! What am I going to do?”

David, in a panic, drops his phone and swings around, looking at his bedroom window. He runs over, pulls open the curtains and starts to open the window. As he does, he hears the door handle of his room start turning. He climbs out his window and starts heading down the roof to its lowest point. When he gets to where he knows he can safely jump, he turns around and locks eyes with the intruder's mask.

He lifts his hand up and flips the bird then jumps off the roof to the ground. He runs to the treeline near his house and finds a thick tree to hide behind. He turns to look at his house, waiting for the intruder to follow him.

The front door opens, and out walks the masked man. David can hear the rough voice of the intruder. 

Intruder says deeply and slow “The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that St. Nicholas would soon be there.”

David waits for the Intruder to turn his back to him, and heads to the back of the house, hoping to get inside and obtain his father’s gun. He makes it, hoping he wasn’t seen. He climbs the roof and enters an unlocked window. Upon entering his parents’ bedroom, the sight of his mother’s body breaks his heart. He heads to his father’s gun safe, enters the code and pulls out his father's pistol. Checking it is loaded and the safety is off, David walks out of his parent’s room and slowly heads towards the stairs.

David slowly peers over the bannister. With no sign of the intruder, he slowly heads down the stairs. He crouches down next to Scott, and cheeks for a pulse.

David Whispers “Thank God! You're still alive.”

David gets up and heads to the front door, slowly peering through the still open gap. He sees nothing. He slowly closes and locks the front door and rushes back over to his brother. He rolls Scott on to his back, trying to look for some reaction. Scott starts to stir. Just as David goes to speak, he hears the floorboards ahead of him squeaking. Looking up, he sees him, the intruder.

In a deep slow growl the Intruder speak “The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads; And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,”

David draws the pistol and shoots the man in the leg. The man lets out an angered growl, and charges at David. David is thrown into the door. He starts punching David over and over again.

While punching David he continues. “When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.”          

David felt himself losing consciousness, struggling to cover his face. The sound of a gun shot gives David a moment of clarity. The punching stops and the sound of police sirens can be heard going off in the background. The glow of blue and red lights flash into the room from the front doors window. David pushes the intruder's now dead body off him. He looks over and sees Scott holding the pistol. 

Scott asks through gasping breaths “Di… did I get him?”

David replied through swollen lips “You got him brother.”

Scott asks still through his gasping breaths “Sss.. so Who is it?”

David rolls the Intruder over and reaches to remove the mask. Startled, David hears the sound of loud banging coming from the front door, followed by the familiar words.

Police “OPEN UP! IT’S THE POLICE!”

Before David goes to open the door, he pulls the mask off, and he finds the lifeless eyes of his father staring back at him…. 

The police entered the home, and quickly got David and Scott into an ambulance. Both brothers were taken to hospital where they were treated for their wounds.

After an intense investigation, their father had been identified as the murderer who was plaguing our town for the last 7 days. They found an incoherent diary, which upon review, the investigators believed the father was suffering from an undiagnosed case of Dissociative Identity Disorder. This is why nobody was able to foresee his crimes.

Inside his house, they located several trinkets that belonged to the victims. They also found the 3 prisoner uniforms with the matching Id numbers. It was ruled that they were likely his first victims. He was dubbed the Christmas Tree Killer by several news outlets and everyone in the area as each victim was found in the same condition. 

This situation really affected our small town. David and Scott Went back to college and told me before they left they would not be returning to our small town. 

It has been a year since this all happened and people have been started to be found murdered again… 

Their throats are slit and their Intestines are wrapped around them like Christmas tinsel. Attached to each of them, they have found various Christmas decorations.
