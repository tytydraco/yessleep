I was 14 at the time, I was visiting my dad. I would go back and forth from my Parents.

My dad lives on a farm. We have a pretty average size farm with a barn, shed, a bunch of farming equipment and silos. Now we are literally in the middle of nowhere, like I mean in the middle of nowhere. The closest town to our house was around 60 miles. Believe it or not we actually had two neighbors a couple miles down. 

I'm going to give you the way of the land, we have a long driveway connecting to the main road. When you pull in it takes around 30 seconds to go to the house driving at a comfortable 20 mph. Once you pass the gate we have, immediate left we have the shed that holds our shop. Then going back to the gate if you look straight ahead from it that is our barn and a bunch of garages for our farming equipment. Then lastly we have four silos going across that. Then to your immediate right when you enter the gates is our house. Our house is actually not that big compared to other farm houses. 

It's a two-story house but it's quite small. If you take a right from the gate, you will meet a screen door. If you enter that screen door. You Will immediately be hit with a big table, if you look to your right from where you entered that's the living room and then inside that living room in the back is a spare room where I slept. If you take a left instead of taking a right you will meet a section where there's a bunch of rooms. If you stand in the middle of that section to your left will be the kitchen and then to your right there's a bathroom a computer room and my dad's room.

There is one door that leads up to the second floor. But it's basically just an attic because we barely go up there as it's freezing cold up there. Once you enter the kitchen if you take a right in the corner we have the basement and then the entrance way where you enter from the front door. But anyways let's get with the story.

So like I said it's just me and my dad at that house. It was any other average day, I woke up from the room and went to go eat breakfast. My dad a hard-working man, woke up extremely early. He would never wake me up but I liked eating breakfast with him. But that being said as I woke up and went into the living room I couldn't help but feel I was being watched, I know really ironic but have you ever had that feeling where you feel really uneasy or nervous. But usually when that happens you just brush it off and that's exactly what I did. I walked to the kitchen and grabbed some bacon and eggs and ate and talked with my dad.

Me and him laughed but when we were done he went outside to go work on his truck and I stayed inside and watched TV for a bit. Now even with me being 14 years old I was pretty strong mentally, honestly I rarely got scared but what happened next was something that could have never been prepared for me. So I was sitting in my living room. Whem out of the blue I heard this absolutely massive bang right above me. 

I About s*** my pants, I jumped so bad I actually fell out of my chair and spilled all of my water. It sounded like somebody just got dropped off of a skyscraper. I looked up almost immediately thinking there would have been a hole in the Ceiling but there was nothing. At that point I knew there was absolutely no way something would have fallen up there as there is nothing in that room. Remember how I told you we never went up there. Well the only thing in that second floor was right next to the stairway when you entered it had nothing else. 

So essentially either something was up there or the roof just fell on top of itself. And that house was dead silent after that, i muted the TV and sat in this Frozen State wondering if I should even walk for a couple minutes. Luckily I seen my dad walking back into the house but it wasn't over. As I didn't want to go investigate it I just thought I should lock the door. But as I was walking over I eerily heard some type of crying or some s*** like that. 

It was literally right next to that door, me being a 14 year old my head was rushing through horror movies. I locked that door in and sprinted the hell out of that house. My dad was halfway walking I immediately ran to him telling him what was going on. Now My dad was a jokester and usually f***** around with me when I did something like this. But I'm just assuming he probably saw the fear in my face and went in there. Now this time we didn't go through the screen door and instead went through the front door.

He opened the door and immediately took a left. For reference when you open the front door and take a left we have a hidden gun in case of an intruder. He grabbed his Glock 19, and we walked into the kitchen. I was a little behind because I was scared to walk in there but then I realized something. The basement door sure as hell was not open as I went to go check to make sure it was shut because the heat from the basement was immense. It's from our furnace because usually basements aren't hot. 

I didn't think much of it though maybe thinking my Dad opened the door, me and my dad both went to his room right next to the door I locked. And this is where I connected two and two together. The door was literally swung wide open and the lock was busted off. By the way those locks were designed to hold shed doors shut in case of the storm. As a matter of fact the door was literally leaning on the wall as the hinges were blown off.

My dad just took a little peek at me and then my entire life I've never seen him look so f****** worried ever, my dad was a former police officer for one year so he added some training. He taught me how to shoot a gun and I've hunted my whole life. So he handed me a gun also, this might sound like something out of call of duty but I actually cleared out the living room and my room. 

I did it and went back to him whispering to him that I did it, now at that point he was at the basement door. As I entered the kitchen I saw him sitting in fear. I asked him what was wrong and to my horror, he heard somebody whispering and crying down there. My dad took a quick look at me and said we're going down there and I agreed.

Each step was horrifying enough, let me tell you how the basement is set up. Once you reach the bottom step which is about 10 steps, to your right we have a workout place. And then do your left you have the washing machine and an additional bathroom with a shower, now in the left corner we have a boxed out room. It's like one of those creepy trap doors you would see in movies. We've only been in there once. It's maybe 8 ft tall and 15 ft wide.

So as we reached halfway we could hear some blatant shuffling, we checked the right and the left place but didn't see anything. I already knew that would ever or whoever was in this house was in that place. My dad reductantly posted up by it and signaled me to go to the other end. By the way the basement is almost pitch black because we didn't turn any lights on, the only light source was illumination from the sunrise which wasn't enough. As my dad entered I entered behind him reductantly, that we were maybe two steps into the room when my dad tried looking for the light switch when we heard this absolutely horrifying screech come from the corner. My dad pushed me and told me to go to the other end while he went to the other end. 

We heard this screeching crying away from the corner and it got progressively closer and closer as time went on. To my dismay I could see it. That thing was tall. Its head had to lean under because it was hitting the ceiling. We're talking 8 ft tall. What made it even worse was this thing was really ripped, it straight up looked like a bodybuilder. Now since it was pitch Black I could only see it because of the illumination not being able to see my dad. It walked out and started walking up the stairway when my dad appeared. We stepped out and my dad was ready to yell. 

When it completely booked it out of the basement. I heard a loud slam and then some more yelling. My dad and I walked up the stairway very reluctantly, now on the 5th step before we entered the kitchen again my dad stopped. He whispered himself holy f****** $hit, i told him what and went to the side of the stairway and saw that the door was blown 30 to 40 ft away from where it's supposed to be. The whole doorway was completely ripped off. But oddly enough it was still standing in the doorway.

My dad was about ready to shoot the thing when it's sprinted I would say 30 mph in almost a second, my dad ran right up the stairway and tried chasing it and I was quickly following behind him when we saw it disappear in the cornfield. 

We immediately contacted the police and it took them 45 minutes to get out there, they scanned and surveyed the area for hours and found absolutely nothing besides the evidence they had. We even checked the security cameras but oddly enough it wasn't working at that time.

It's been a while since that's happened and I haven't seen that thing in a while, if anyone can tell me what that thing is I would love to know.
