Just came across this and even though I’m sure it’s classified, I couldn’t live with myself if I just sat on it. This sounds serious. Anybody out there in Alaska right now who can confirm what this is saying?

“Office of the Director of National Intelligence Preliminary Assessment: The Blob

SCOPE AND ASSUMPTIONS

This preliminary report is provided by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in response to the provision in Senate Reporting Requirement 136-717-sp, accompanying the –REDACTED–, that the DNI, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), is to submit an intelligence assessment of the threat posed by a heretofore little understood mass of motile and aggressive anomalous organic material, herein referred to as “the Blob,” and the progress the Department of Defense Unidentified Anomalous Biology Task Force (UABTF) has made in understanding this threat.

This report provides an overview for policymakers of the challenges associated with characterizing the potential threat posed by the Blob while also providing a means to develop relevant processes, policies, technologies, and training for the U.S. military and other U.S. Government (USG) personnel if and when they encounter the Blob, so as to enhance the Intelligence Community’s (IC) ability to understand the Blob.

The Blob has reached a threat-level sufficient to warrant the attention of ODNI. Currently. the blob has grown to the size of a small city and weighs approximately .17 trillion metric tons. It has obliterated, since its discovery earlier this year, a combined 1.1 trillion metric tons of plant and animal matter. In addition, the Blob has caused the permanent disruption of a key natural-gas pipeline. Total military and civilian casualties are unknown at this time but current estimates are in the hundreds. Several towns and settlements on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border have been evacuated to prevent further loss of life.

The Director, UABTF, is the accountable official for ensuring the timely collection and consolidation of data on the Blob, its whereabouts, and projected movements. The dataset described in this report is currently limited primarily to U.S. Government reporting of incidents occurring from –REDACTED– to –REDACTED–. Data continues to be collected and analyzed on the Blob as its mass of anomalous organic material progresses south along the Alaska/Canadian border, and communities in its path are subsequently evacuated by either U.S. or Canadian authorities.

ODNI prepared this report for the Congressional Intelligence and Armed Services Committees. UABTF drafted this report, with input from –REDACTED–, DIA, FBI, NRO, NGA, NSA, Air Force, Army, Navy, Navy/ONI, DARPA, –REDACTED–, NOAA, NGA, ODNI/NIM-Emerging and Disruptive Technology, –REDACTED–, and ODNI/National Intelligence Council.

ASSUMPTIONS AND HISTORICITY

A careful review of U.S. Air Force archives indicates that the earliest record of the anomalous organic material (“the Blob”) is from an Initial Contact Incident (ICI) in the town of –REDACTED–, Pennsylvania in 1958. This was a high-casualty event with full containment.

Contact Incident Mitigation Personnel (CIMP) isolated and immobilized the Blob on-site via flash-freezing. The Blob was subsequently airlifted by joint CIMP-USAF personnel to –REDACTED–, Alaska where it was expected to remain frozen indefinitely due to average temperatures in the area.

However, subsequent to the events of 1958, the earth’s average temperatures have risen and continue to rise. Permafrost is thawing, releasing organisms that were formerly trapped in a frozen state. The reintroduction of these organisms to the modern environment represents one of the great unknowns and potential hazards we currently face.

So far, the Blob is the only one such known anomalous organic material to re-emerge and pose a threat to populations and infrastructure it encounters at the scale being observed at this time.

Various forms of sensors that have been placed in the predicted path of the Blob that generally operate correctly and capture enough real data to allow initial assessments, but deviations in the may be attributable to sensor anomalies and/or unknown physical or paranormal properties of the Blob.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The limited amount of high-quality reporting on the Blob hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions about the nature of the anomaly. Nor can any source of agency (whether or not the Blob conscious) be determined at this time. The Unidentified Anomalous Biology Task Force (UABTF) considered a range of information on the Blob described in U.S. military and IC (Intelligence Community) reporting. But because the reporting at the time of the Initial Contact Incident lacked sufficient specificity (due to the ICI being occluded by events of the then ongoing Cold War), the UABTF has ultimately recognized that a unique, tailored reporting process is required to provide sufficient data for analysis of the Blob, as events on the ground unfold and new data on the anomaly comes to light.

As a result, the UABTF concentrated this review on reports that occurred over the last 90 days, the majority of which are a result of this new tailored process to better capture Blob-related events through formalized reporting.

Most of the Blob-related events reported were registered across multiple sensors, to include radar, infrared, electro-optical, weapon seekers, biochemical air and ground samples, and visual observation.

In a limited number of incidents, the Blob reportedly appears to exhibit unusual characteristics, such as endocytosis, perceptual capacity, and responsiveness to its surroundings. Some observations could be the result of sensor errors, or observer misperception and require additional rigorous analysis.

The Blob clearly poses a safety issue for residents of the immediately affected areas, as well as a significant threat to infrastructure and local economies. The Blob appears to absorb and subsequently destroy all organic matter that it encounters. This includes living creatures, vegetation, man-made organic materials, and petrochemical resources. Given the fact that the Blob is doubling in size every few days due to aggressive and hyper-active endocytosis of any non-self organic matter it encounters, specifically petrochemical resources, the Blob may pose a challenge to U.S. national security.

Safety concerns primarily centers local communities in the path of the Blob, as well as first responders contending with an increasingly large and aggressive Blob.

The Blob would also represent a national security challenge if any foreign adversary collection platforms harness the novel biological properties of the Blob as breakthrough or disruptive technology.

Consistent consolidation of reports from across the local, state, and federal government bodies, standardized reporting, increased collection and analysis, and a streamlined process for screening all such reports against a broad range of relevant Unidentified Anomalous Biology (UAB) data will allow for a more sophisticated analysis of the Blob that is likely to deepen our understanding. Some of these steps are resource-intensive and would require additional investment.

AVAILABLE REPORTING LARGELY INCONCLUSIVE

All agencies involved in the mitigation of the threat posed by the Blob must be able to answer the following:

What is the current size and trajectory of the Blob, and how fast is it growing?

What is the composition of the Blob, and what are its physical and chemical properties?

Since the likely cause of the Blob’s re-emergence is the thawing of permafrost, what steps can be taken to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future?

What are the potential health and environmental impacts of the Blob, and how can they be mitigated or prevented?

What resources and capabilities are available to respond to the Blob, and what additional support may be needed from federal or international agencies?

Answering these questions would help the US government develop an effective strategy for mitigating the threat posed by the Blob, while also minimizing the impact on affected communities and the environment.

Limited currently leaves most of these questions unanswered at time of writing.

Limited data and inconsistency in reporting are key challenges to evaluating the Blob. No standardized reporting mechanism for Unidentified Anomalous Biology (UAB) existed until –REDACTED–established one in –REDACTED–. The U.S. Navy and Air Force subsequently adopted that mechanism in –REDACTED–, but it remains limited to USG reporting. The UABTF regularly heard anecdotally during its research into –REDACTED– about the possibility of the imminent thaw of the Blob, but these reports were never captured in formal or informal reporting by those observers.

244 reports originated from USG sources. 56 originated from Canadian sources. Of these, 80 reports involved observation with multiple sensors.

Most military reports described the Blob only after interruption of pre-planned training or other military activity.

DATA COLLECTION CHALLENGES

Sensor limitations remain obstacles to collecting data on the Blob. Anecdotal evidence suggests telekinetic interference of sensor devices, possibly from the Blob itself. Evidence remains anecdotal. Investigations are underway into that area of inquiry and data is pending.

Data collection efforts currently face technical challenges, such as how to ensure safety of flight for military and civilian observation aircraft.

The sensors mounted on U.S. military platforms are typically designed to fulfill specific missions. As a result, those sensors are not generally suited for identifying the Blob.

Sensor vantage points and the numbers of sensors concurrently observing the Blob play substantial roles in distinguishing Blob from known organic objects, geological features, and man-made structures.

Optical sensors have the benefit of providing some insight into relative size, shape, and positional deltas of the Blob.

Radiofrequency sensors provide more accurate velocity and range information.

POTENTIAL PATTERNS

Although there was wide variability in the reports and the dataset is currently too limited to allow for detailed trend or pattern analysis, there was some clustering of observations regarding shape, size, and self-propulsion. Sightings of the Blob also tend to cluster around the U.S. training and testing grounds, but we assess that this may result from a collection bias as a result of focused attention, greater numbers of latest-generation sensors operating in those areas, unit expectations, and guidance to report anomalies.

In 29 incidents, described in 21 reports, observers reported unusual movement patterns or other characteristics of the Blob that, while not revealing consciousness or self-awareness, exhibit characteristics that can be classified as telekinesis or telekinetics. Nearby objects appear to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly without discernible means of propulsion, following diverse trajectories relative to the situs of the Blob at time of observation.

In a small number of cases, military aircraft systems processed radio frequency (RF) energy associated with Blob sightings.

The UABTF holds a small amount of data that appear to show the Blob demonstrating a degree of radar signature management. Additional rigorous analysis are necessary by multiple teams or groups of technical experts to determine the nature and validity of these data. We are conducting further analysis to determine if breakthrough technologies are possible from the further study of the Blob.

INDICATIONS OF SENTIENCE, GOALS, OR MOTIVATION

The events and characteristics of the Blob documented in this limited dataset demonstrates an array of behaviors prerogatives, reinforcing the possibility that the makeup of the Blob is not homogeneous.

There are probably multiple types of Unidentified Anomalous Biology (UAB) requiring different explanations based on the range of appearances and behaviors described in the available reporting. Our analysis of the data specifically regarding the Blob supports the construct that if and when individual UAB incidents are resolved they will fall into one of five potential explanatory categories: sentient airborne phenomena, paranormal atmospheric phenomena, rogue USG or U.S. industry developmental programs, foreign adversary systems, and a catchall “other” bin.

IMMOBILIZATION AND MITIGATION

The UABTF is looking for novel ways to increase collection of Blob data collection cluster areas when U.S. forces are not present as a way to baseline “standard” Blob activity and mitigate the collection bias in the dataset.

However, growth trajectories derived from the existing data show that, at current rates, the Blob could reach a diameter larger than the state of Rhode Island by the end of this year, if left unchecked. By that point, the Blob will weigh 1.2 trillion metric tons. By New Year’s, the Blob can have consumed all living things from Chistochina, Alaska, west to the town of Dry Creek, Canada, and south to the ports of Cordova, Alaganik, and Katalia on Alaska’s coast. In addition, numerous pipelines and petroleum extraction sites will be irreparably damaged by the Blob.

UABTF studies that utilize advanced algorithms to search the existing corpus of Blob data indicates that only a flash-freeze event can halt the growth and spread of the Blob.

Currently, the sole means of precipitating such a flash-freeze event on the scale necessary to arrest the spread of the Blob and halt further damage would be a series of controlled nuclear detonations.

Currently, there are –REDACTED– active and armed W-80 (150 kiloton) and –REDACTED– active and armed W-87 (300 kiloton) available in the U.S. nuclear arsenal. These munitions are sufficient for a string of coordinated nuclear detonations, beginning in the Brevig Mission area of coastal Alaska and following the 65th parallel east to Auyuittuq National Park on Canada’s eastern coast. The controlled and coordinated nuclear detonations would suffice to effect a “nuclear winter” in the earth’s northern hemisphere, dropping temperatures precipitously enough to re-freeze the Blob and halt its advance south.

The UABTF also plans to update its current interagency UAB collection strategy in order to bring to bear relevant collection platforms and methods from the DoD and the IC.

INCREASE INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The UABTF has indicated that additional funding for research and development could further the future study of the topics laid out in this report. Such investments should be guided by a Multilateral Blob Collection Strategy, UAB R&D Technical Roadmap, and a UAB Program Plan.
