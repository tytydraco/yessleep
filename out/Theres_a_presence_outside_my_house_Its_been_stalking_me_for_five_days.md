It’s been another couple days, now. Things have gotten worse, so I wanted to go ahead and keep a record, just in case. 

Some of you mentioned calling for help. I did try, obviously. I tried as soon as the thing got close to my windows, but all I heard on the line was static. Not even a “line busy” tone, static. I can only assume this creature has something to do with this, but I obviously can’t say for certain. It’s the only thing that makes sense to me, though.

I sat in my house, trying as best I could to keep track of the thing as it lazily patrolled. Every once in a while, it would go back to the car and mutilate the bodies of my parents out there. 

My mother had been drug back into view by noon of the same day she died, and the creature would occasionally go back to her, beating or slashing at her for a few minutes, before resuming its vigil at my windows.

The day passed without any further incident. I stayed up all night, slamming energy drinks and coffee I didn’t want to take my eyes off of the thing, as much as possible. The feeling seemed to be mutual, since whenever I moved around the house, it would follow me from window to window. 

I was shaking, both from fear and caffeine. I knew this wasn’t sustainable, but what else could I do, really?

This cycle went on for a few days. By the time I posted last, it had been three days. Today is the end of the fifth. Today is the day someone finally came.

Around three in the afternoon, I heard footsteps approaching my front door. I got up from my seat at the kitchen table and ran to the door, panicking already. I tried to spot the creature, to no avail. Somehow, it had gotten away from me. 

*Knock, knock, knock.*

Three firm, slow knocks. Then, 

“Hi there! It’s Carl Schliff, the mailman? I noticed that your mailbox is pretty stuffed full… just wanted to come deliver today’s and make sure everything was alright!”

I was bewildered. Surely he’d seen the mess out front?

I peeked out the kitchen window and couldn’t believe it. The bodies were gone. The blood was gone. The car was still parked where it had been left, and now there was a postal truck next to it, but somehow this thing had completely rid the driveway of any sign of trouble.

“Uh… Hello? I see lights on, and I see the car in the driveway. Everyone ok in there?”

I shook my head and walked back to the door. “Listen, mister, you need to leave, ok? It’s not safe here.”

A sigh came from opposite me. “I’m calling the police, ma’am. I don’t know what you mean, but I’m not qualified to deal with whatever it is.”

Yeah, no kidding dude.

I heard him start trying to mess with his phone, but he seemed to run into the same problem I did. 

“Listen, mister, you need to leave now, I don’t know where the thing went, but-”

“Ma’am, you’re not making any sense. As soon as I can get my phone working, I’m going to-”

About halfway through his sentence, I saw movement out of the corner of my eye, coming around the side of the house. 

The mailman’s sentence was cut off as I heard a loud *THUD* from outside. Something heavy hit the door, and I staggered backwards, tripping and landing on my ass. I pushed myself away from the door, as another loud *THWACK* came through. This one was more wet, sounded like someone smashing a watermelon.

Blood started to pool underneath the front door, slowly. I felt vomit rising in my throat again, and I turned away and threw up facing away from the door. 

I stood, shakily, and tried to focus on anything but the slowly expanding crimson pool at my door. I looked out the front window, and saw the creature, impaling the mailman through his back with a spiked appendage.

I retched again as it walked over to the window, holding the body up to the glass. The man’s head was crushed, his face distorted and warped under the force of the blows. Blood soaked his light blue shirt, and a bag of mail hung weakly at his side, next to an arm that had likely tried to shield from a blow, considering how badly broken it was, with bones jutting out at all sorts of jagged angles. 

The body gently bumped the glass. Then, again. A third time. The creature dropped it after that, smears of blood staining the window, painting the incoming light scarlet as it broke through.

I slumped against the far wall, feeling the sun beat down on me through the stained window. Temperatures had been in the high 90s all week. Normally, we could pop the windows and be fine. Now, though, that wasn’t an option. If that thing outside didn’t kill me, the heat might.

I don’t know what to do, really. Nobody else knows I’m out here, or that I’m by myself, or that I’m being stalked by this thing. Anyone who comes is just going to get killed by this thing too, and I don’t know if I can have that on my conscience. 

I want to be safe. I want everyone else to be safe. But mostly, I just want this to be [over.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LobotomyTheatre/)
