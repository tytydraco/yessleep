Right from the start, before anything truly horrible happened, I was pretty sure I didn’t want to live in the mountains. I was a city girl, born and raised. I never heard quiet until my fifth-grade class toured a recording studio and I stepped into the soundproof booth by myself. My heart beat terrifyingly loud, and I wanted to get out right away, but seeing me panic, my classmates refused to open the locked door, laughing in total silence on the other side of the glass.

The forest was little different, just a bigger booth. No horns honking, no rattling of passing trucks. No one yelling at maniac bicyclists. We had moved to a small house on a hillside thick with pines that barely rattled in the wind. Right away, I knew I hated it here.

“What do you think?” asked my husband, Mark, breathing in the fresh air, dramatically. “Paradise, right?”

“I don’t know,” I said, hating every second. “I’m sure I’ll get used to it.”

We were unpacking boxes. Everything that had seemed perfectly in place in our city apartment seemed just as out of place here as us. What was a midcentury modern table doing here in the middle of the woods? Why these Delftware plates? Why was the TV so comically small for the big wall above the fireplace?

I walked out onto the front porch and looked out at the valley. There was something different in the air today, the usual pine scent cut through with a tinge of acid, like I’d licked a piece of charcoal. Looking through the trees, I spotted a thin column of smoke rising from one of the nearby hills.

I felt a pit in my stomach. I’d spent the last night rolling in bed, dreaming of a forest fire tightening around us like a noose. It would be impossible to navigate our little one-lane dirt driveway in any kind of smoke. Fire meant death, an inevitable end that included plenty of shaking in terror, knowing what was coming.

“Mark,” I said. “Over there.”

He joined me on the porch, a cup of coffee in hand.

“Probably just someone doing a burn,” he said. “The realtor said they do that here, remember? Burn trash, debris, fallen trees… We’ll probably be having to do it soon. I’m pretty sure that smoke’s coming from the Beth Green’s house. Our realtor said she was kind of a crazy cat lady, and to leave her alone or else we could have some serious problems.”

I watched the black smoke rise for a moment and bit my lip. “Do you think we need to call someone? The sheriff? The fire department?”

He shook his head.

“I’m sure it’s fine. We don’t want to get Mrs. Green in trouble if she’s burning illegally. And besides, the police here would probably just think we’re a city couple out of our league here in the woods, jumping at everything,” he said. “We don’t want to get a reputation already.”

I blushed. The day before, while Mark had been at work, I’d had the windows open and an animal noise–some kind of screech–that had cut through the silence, chilling me to the bone. I had called the police before I stopped to think about it. The receptionist had been kind, but unhelpful.

“There *are* bears that far up the mountain, darling,” she had said in a motherly voice. “Big cats, too. Didn’t you know that when you bought the place?”

I hadn’t.

“What… um. What do most people do… about the bears?”

“Buy a gun,” she said. “A big one. Your realtor really shoulda told you that.”

I was too embarrassed to mention that I hadn’t ever met our realtor, or even looked at the property before Mark signed the papers.

According to him and to our realtor, this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The house had come on the market unexpectedly when Mark’s uncle passed away. His cousins had intended to list it, but because we were already looking to move, Mark jumped on it.

He had been tired of our life in the city. It was no place to raise the hypothetical kids we one day intended to have. And he hated his job, which had been a necessity to make rent.

“This will be a fresh start for us,” he’d said. “Take this adventure with me. Trust me.”

I was equally miserable at my job, or maybe even more so. My mental health had been abysmal. I’d barely been making it through the days functional, so what did I know about what we should be doing? And what did I have to lose? So I said yes.

And now, here we were, just two months later, in a home that didn’t feel like a home, surrounded by pines and bears, and all of our belongings stuffed into moving boxes and bubble wrap.

“You still look worried,” Mark said, giving me a kiss. “Are you worrying?”

“I won’t call the police again,” I said firmly. “Have a good day at work.”

Mark saluted me and grabbed his lunch before heading out the door. Mark had already found work at a small accounting firm in town. Our costs were low enough here that I didn’t even need to work, but ever since the move two days ago, I had found myself searching job listings. Maybe just to get away from the quiet.Time passed differently when Mark was away, and before I knew it, it was nearly lunch. I rinsed some bell peppers and began to cut them up for a salad when I heard it: a soft clacking sound. It was so light you might have mistaken it for rain.

Clack. Clack. Clack.

It was too unsteady, too irregular to be water.

Clack—clack.

I followed the sound to the side door that led to the back porch. There was a little black kitten there, its front two paws white, as if it were wearing little gloves. It looked up at me with big yellow eyes and meowed sadly.

I jumped at the noise, cutting my finger with the knife I had forgotten I was holding. For a moment, it sat there, looking curiously at the blood dripping from my finger and spotting the porch. Then, as if on a delayed reaction, I cried out, and the kitten bolted. I stood still, hoping it would return. I had felt good to have a little companion, if only for a moment.

I stuck my finger in my mouth and put down the knife. The kitten had seemed lost. Surely it wasn’t safe out here if there were *bears* roaming around.

Singing some old Tom Petty song to ward away the silence, I got our smallest bowl, filled it with milk, and put it outside on the porch. I stared at it for a moment. Oddly, I had the impulse to add a drop or two of my blood to the bowl, but that couldn’t be right. The kitten wouldn’t want that, would it?

I couldn’t think of anything else to do, so I walked back inside to finish the salad.

I realized I was singing at full volume now, like a crazy person, so I switched to humming, but that felt somehow worse. I shut up, but the quiet was starting to get to me again, so I clicked on the TV. The cable company hadn’t been by yet to set us up, but apparently Mark’s uncle had an antenna that could at least pick up the local news channels.

I let the news play as I went back to making my salad.

“...and our hearts go out to Beth Green, whose home was found burning this morning.”

My eyes snapped up to the TV, my heart dropping.

“By the time first responders realized the situation and made it up the mountain, her house had nearly completely burned and Mrs. Green herself is missing. The search for her continues.”

I ran to the window where I had seen the smoke. I could distantly see a couple flashing lights of a fire engine, and the smoke had dwindled down to a thin mist.

“Shit,” I said. I should have made the call. I looked back out the window at the little bowl of milk.

Crazy cat lady, Mark had called her. So, now I knew where the kitten came from.

He’d been so sure when he said it would be fine. I marveled at how confident he’d been, despite being totally wrong. I’d never felt that sure of myself once in my life, even when I was one-hundred percent sure of something.

I remembered other stupid arguments over the years. Mark telling me that Bart Simpson’s mother was named Midge, or that the first Thor movie came out before Iron Man. In every case, I’d *known*, but I’d just shrugged my shoulders and said he was probably right. Later, we’d look it up on Google and laugh about it, but it didn’t change anything. There was always a next time, another thing for Mark to be wrong about, all full of certainty and bluster.

To ease my guilt over Mrs. Green, I made the long drive into town and went to the grocery store. I loaded a bag with every cat treat they had.

“Got a new pet?” the clerk asked.

I tried to smile. “Something like that.”

When I got home, it was already getting dark. I emptied everything onto the porch. Kitty treats, anchovies, anything I could think of that a cat might like.

“Here, kitty, kitty,” I whispered quietly into the twilight.

Only silence answered me.

I went back into the house to get dinner ready. Mark would be home soon, and I’d realized I’d never even eaten lunch.

I finished the salad and started some steak cooking on the stove when I heard a deep scraping sound, then a crash.

My mind conjured a bear’s claws scraping the wood of the deck; a kitten locked in its jaws.

Fear spiked in the pit of my stomach.

I ran to the glass door that opened to the porch and threw it open…

But nothing was there.

I took a step outside and looked down. There were deep gashes on the wood like claw marks. The pile of kitty treats was gone, down to the last crumb. Not only that, but the bowl was destroyed. I slowly picked up the pieces. Putting them together, I realized a fairly big chunk was missing, as if whatever came for the food had bitten clean through the shattered ceramic and swallowed it.

For a moment, I paused. I’m not sure if I breathed or not. Suddenly, I was sure I was being watched. I tried to listen, but all I heard was the terrible silence, wrapping all around me, ready to strangle me to death.

I dropped the pieces, realizing that it was myself I should be afraid for.

I ran back inside the house, slamming the door behind me and bolting it shut. My breath was coming fast, and I had to work to fill my lungs.

Then I realized I was filling my lungs with… smoke. The fire alarm started blaring.

The steaks. Shit.

I ran back to the stove and turned the burner off. I tried to fan away the smoke, but at that moment Mark walked in.

“Whoa! What’s going on?” he cried, running to the kitchen.

“I burned steak.” I tried to say it lightly, but he gave me a scrutinizing look.

“What really happened?” he asked.

I sighed and told him the whole story over salads and peanut butter sandwiches.

When I was done, he put his hand on mine.

“What were you thinking? Putting all that food out… you could’ve brought in a bear. Or worse.”

I flushed. “I just wanted to help that kitten.”

“What happened to Mrs. Green wasn’t your fault. You didn’t do anything wrong.”

“I didn’t do *anything*,” I corrected him. “I could have.”

“It isn’t up to you to save the world.” He sighed. “I hate leaving you here alone all day. You have to promise me that you’re going to keep yourself safe.”

“I’m sure I wasn’t in any danger,” I said.

He didn’t look convinced. “There’s one way to be sure. We could always check the cameras.”

When we had first moved in, Mark had said that his uncle had set up a security system, and that he’d gotten the passwords for it so we could use it.

Mark pulled up the security camera for the back porch and scrolled through the day.

We watched the events of the morning and afternoon play out: the little kitten prowling the porch, my own cameo calling for it and then depositing the treats. We fast-forwarded a bit, watching nothing happen.

And then–I couldn’t believe what I saw.

I had been expecting *maybe* a bear, or some kind of bobcat.

What had visited our porch and demolished all of the kitty treats was no animal that I’d ever seen before. It happened so fast, it was really just a blur on the screen. Even slowing it down frame by frame, I couldn’t quite be sure of what I saw, but here’s what I think it looked like:

Covered in spines, easily the size of two bears stacked together, this beast lumbered onto the porch, talons scraping the wood. Razor-sharp spines protruded out of its back, and its eyes–there was something about them that made my blood run cold.

At first I couldn’t place it, then I realized what it was: those eyes were *far* too intelligent.

“Fucking hell, what is that thing?” Mark yelped.

He rewound and fast-forwarded the frame and bit. Back and forth. The thing moved with incredible speed, almost impossibly so given its size.

“It must be some kind of glitch with the camera,” he said after a few seconds. “I’ll return it tomorrow. Get a new one.”

I reached past him to move the video forward a bit more. Because I knew what was coming next and I had to know how close it had been.

Just a second, a split second before I opened the porch door, its ears twitched, and it leapt from the porch. For a moment, it waited in the background, watching as I examined the broken bowl. Then slowly, without a sound, it disappeared into the woods.

“It must have been a bear,” said Mark a little later as we lay in the dark, trying to ignore the silence of the woods all around us. “Just a really big bear.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Probably.”

“We learned our lesson, though,” he said. “No more feeding the wildlife.”

“Sure,” I said. “Sounds like you know best.”

A few minutes later, I could hear him snoring.

But I didn’t sleep.

Because he *didn’t* know best. He didn’t know shit. And I was going to prove it.

Before I knew what I was doing, I found myself in front of the refrigerator, letting the cold air breathe over me, the cool air chilling the night sweat on my skin as the fan struggled and hummed.
