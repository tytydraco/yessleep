Working night shift takes a toll on your body and mind. It can increase the risk of cancer, ruin your sleep, slow down the production of certain hormones, and even cause depression and antisocial behaviors. It sucks. It was never really my choice to work the night shift security at an old folks’ home. I worked the day shift for years until they fired nearly half of all the employees on campus, and they gave me the choice: work nights, or turn in my uniforms.

It's not all too bad; it’s an uneventful job most of the time. I’ll get calls from residents ranging from 80-100 years old requesting help with opening jars, changing light bulbs, and other things of that nature. After working 8 years here, my empathy begins to run dry. There are only so many times I can take getting calls from a resident asking to plunge their toilet, or, God forbid, help change their Depends.

Don’t get me wrong, there have been times when I earned my pay tenfold. Finding residents who had fallen and split their head open is more common than you think; the amount of blood that these old folks can lose would surprise you. In these situations, I call 911 for the resident and do my best to keep them hanging on. I’ve found dead bodies as well, not as common as the falls. It’s funny, everyone on the security team says they get a strange feeling before finding a body. I never felt it. I was always lucky with bodies. I worked the job for seven and a half years before finding one.

The first body I found had sat for three days. I received a call from a family member asking to check on him; the resident’s name was Willy. He was a nice resident, sometimes driving by the office in his little scooter and waving. Anything beyond that, I couldn’t tell you. I went over to his apartment and rang the doorbell several times. After no answer, I peeked beyond the venetian blinds he had set up on his window. Within the small crack of the blinds, I saw blood on the floor, so I quickly let myself in with the skeleton key.

The smell was like a wall you could touch, pennies and piss. It took everything not to vomit.  Large dried-up chunky puddles of blood covered the apartment. I followed the smears of blood, weirdly, they looked almost like brush strokes on a painting. This paint trail led me to the brush: Willy, underneath his bed. Police said he crushed the spot between his eyes when he fell face forward into his bathroom sink, blinded. He crawled around his apartment until he passed out from blood loss, and then shortly died after.

It didn’t make sense to me. Why crawl under the bed? I remember reading that some animals try to hide when their time is near; my old family cat did the same thing. I don’t think this was the case with Willy, however. When I bent down to check under the bed, the image was seared into my mind; he was like a child hiding from a monster. Hands curled up to his chest, fingers covering his mouth.

Things haven't felt the same since finding Willy six months ago. I’m more paranoid. I keep thinking of how he looked, hiding. Did he see something? Did something do that to him? I think the old folks feel it too; they seem more edgy, more demanding on calls. Word of a “crime scene” spread around the campus like wildfire. Since then, I have received more calls from residents claiming that trespassers on their porch are breaking in. They have all been false alarms. They’ll swear they heard someone knocking on their door, or even see someone in their actual apartment, and every time I check, nothing.

I received a call from one resident, a little old lady, who said that she was in her apartment, under her bed, and someone was tapping on the glass of her window, trying to get inside. Honestly, I got a bit mad, another call from a resident who is demented and imagining things. I then heard the glass tapping on the phone, and my blood went cold.
