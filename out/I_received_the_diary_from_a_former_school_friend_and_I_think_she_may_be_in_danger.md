Hello, I don't think it would be a good idea to reveal my name, but you can call me Bill. I (M23) recently received a strange package in the mail. Last week, as I was returning from my morning walk, I noticed there was an envelope placed on top of my mailbox, which immediately struck me as odd. It had no recipient, only a sender, and the name was "Sam Harris." She was a girl who went to high school with me, we were friends, I had a slight crush on her, but nothing serious. We only spoke once or twice during college and adult life. Curiosity led me to bring this package inside, who knows what it could be.  
  
Inside, there was a twine tying a bundle of handwritten leaf papers. Sam enjoyed writing, she said she wanted to be a novelist, so it wasn't surprising. However, the content of what she calls a diary (and therefore I will probably refer to it as Sam Harris's diary in further possible updates) was a confusing thing. She apparently talks about a small town in North Carolina and uses the leaves as notes for something she planned to be a book. Sounds fun, right? But I assure you, it was enough to worry me and made me come here in search of help or at least some answers. Now, let me stop talking and show you Sam Harris's diary:

Dear Diary,  
I've been facing a terrible creative block lately, and I feel like my publisher is getting impatient. Pressured by the looming deadline of my next book, I've been desperately searching for inspiration in every possible corner. However, all I find are empty ideas and superficial stories. I desperately need something new and authentic.  
  
I decided to take a different approach to overcome this stagnant phase. I've spent the past few weeks wandering the streets of the town, interviewing ordinary people about local legends and stories. Believe it or not, I stumbled upon something intriguing that could be the source of my creative redemption: the well of Evergreen Mansion. During a casual conversation with an elderly resident of the area, I mentioned my quest for fascinating tales. He told me, in a conspiratorial whisper, about the legend surrounding the old well located in the gardens of Evergreen Mansion. According to the story, the well is cursed, inhabited by dark creatures capable of driving anyone to the brink of madness and suicidal despair. The man's words echoed in my mind, stirring a mix of fear and curiosity.  
  
And here I am, filled with excitement and a hint of apprehension, ready to embark on a "journey into the unknown." It will be an opportunity to test myself and perhaps even venture into journalism. This is the perfect chance to find true inspiration for my writing.  
  
I am meticulously preparing for the expedition to the well of Evergreen Mansion. Today, I made a list of essential equipment: a reliable flashlight, sturdy ropes, a camera to document my findings, and a notebook to record every detail of this adventure. I need to ensure that I am properly equipped to face any challenges that may arise in my path. Additionally, I've done some research on the history of Evergreen Mansion and its cursed well. I discovered that the mansion belonged to a prominent family in the city's past, they had a coffee business or something of the sort, but it has been abandoned for decades. Few have dared to explore the property since then, due to the chilling stories surrounding it.  
  
I am aware of the risks this expedition presents, but I also feel that it is my duty as a writer to investigate these hidden mysteries and bring to light what is concealed in the depths of the well. I know this challenging journey may test my limits, but I am willing to face it head-on. Tomorrow, I will set off for Evergreen Mansion, carrying with me the hope of finding the much-needed inspiration. I solemnly promise here that I will document every moment, every emotion, and every encounter I have during this expedition.  
  
Wish me luck, Diary. I am about to dive into the depths of the unknown.  
  
As always, S.H.

Hello Diary,  
  
I have finally had my first visit to the dreaded well of Evergreen Mansion. Allow me to share with you all the fascinating details I found there. The expedition began with a mix of excitement and nervousness. Upon arriving at the mansion, I was met with its dark and imposing aura. Chris, my photographer friend, was by my side, ready to capture every moment of this journey. Together, we ventured into the overgrown gardens, following the path that led to the well. As we approached the well, the atmosphere around us felt heavy, as if the air was imbued with an ancient and sinister secret. My heart raced, but curiosity prevailed, urging me to continue.  
  
To my surprise, the initial impressions were disappointing. The well was shrouded in an eerie calmness. There were no immediate signs of the shadowy entities or any indication of madness mentioned in the legends. At first, everything appeared ordinary and abandoned. As I explored the surroundings, I found some yellowed and weathered papers. They seemed to be documents related to the sale of old properties, possibly connected to Evergreen Mansion. The content was illegible in some parts, but I could make out family names and dates dating back centuries. Could these documents be linked to the curse of the well?  
  
The most astonishing discovery, however, awaited inside. I cautiously descended the rusty wooden stairs, and there, in a small underground chamber, I found a skeleton dressed in period clothing. The skeleton was seated on an ancient throne adorned with a strange symbol carved into its base. A sense of unease ran through my body as I witnessed that macabre scene. Chris captured some impressive images with his camera. I entrusted him to document the details that I myself might overlook amidst my immersion in that unsettling environment. After the visit, we agreed to meet and analyze the footage, hoping to find some clues that could shed light on the well's curse and its implications.  
  
I returned home with a whirlwind of emotions. I am still processing everything I saw and experienced. The handwriting is shakier than usual, and I attribute that to both my excitement and fear. This journey is only just beginning. I am eager to share with you every breakthrough, every mystery unraveled. With each step taken toward the well, I feel that I am also approaching a new story, I smell a bestseller in the making.  
  
I'll be back here after reviewing the footage.  
  
As always, S.H.

So, do you guys think this could be some kind of prank? Perhaps a marketing stunt by Miss Harris? Or maybe there's some truth to it? If any of you have any information about Sam or this Evergreen Mansion, please share it in the comments. Guesses about what it could be are also always welcome. Until next time.
