When this all happened, I was between jobs. A friend helped by selling some higher-end cameras and gear to me for cheap. I planned to resell them for more but found it difficult. All the offers were too low so I kept the gear to do jobs with it.  

I worked a wedding or two and found them far too stressful.  Just as I was getting desperate, I saw a job request sitting in my junk folder. Someone wanted me to film segments for their new YouTube channel investigating urban legends. The first job would be walking around in the middle of the woods. I hated hiking. I hated camping. And I hated hanging out in a forest.  I replied to the email and gave him a ridiculous price for my time. I expected to never hear from them again.   

Then they agreed. I assumed they were talking a big game just to get me on board but I was paid half upfront. Even if I got stiffed for the rest, the payment I already received was enough for me to do the job. At least it paid my rent for the month. If I played my cards right, I might have some sort of steady income until the money on their end dried up.  

That’s how I found myself unpacking a bunch of expensive cameras at the start of a hiking trail meeting six new people.  

Two introduced themselves as the main faces of the channel. Chris was young and blonde. Maybe around nineteen with a phone in his hand at all times. He told me his last name and paused expecting a reaction. It turns out his family was well off so this side project was just something to keep him busy. Instead of buying luxury cars with his father’s money, he put it into a YouTube channel focusing on his niche interests. If he wasn’t so damn annoying, I would have liked him as a person.  

His friend Conner was tall and thin. He appeared as if he didn’t want to be there and most of his comments sounded forced. Like he needed to reply to Chris every time he spoke.   

I was introduced to the rest of the cast but I didn’t remember their names. There were two girls fresh out of a college art course making plans and discussing how to line up shots. Two guys stood by carrying bags of things I didn’t think we would need for a day trip into the woods.   

We stopped at the ranger’s office first for an interview. I was thankful to get out of the muggy air. The girls took forever to get the cameras in the right spot. I swear we moved the tripod around ten times and they kept adjusting items in the back of the shot. Who cares if there are four books on the table behind the ranger instead of three?  

We finally were able to start the interview. Two rangers were working, but the older of the two refused to be on camera.  

“Can you tell us about any odd experiences you’ve had working here?” Chris started.  

Conner fidgeted and Chris shot him a look.  

“Forgive my friend here. He doesn’t believe in any of this stuff.” Chris said and it made the entire room stiff and awkward.  

Conner was just bored. He didn’t care if the stories he would hear were true or not. A year or so ago I watched a few videos of a popular ghost-hunting pair on YouTube. One believed in ghosts and the other didn’t. They had good chemistry while making the videos entertaining to watch. Chris and Conner had none of that. Chris was just using his money to copy the channel without understanding what made it work. Just having a tall host who didn’t believe in the supernatural wasn’t enough to become successful.  

“Well...” The ranger started when the tension passed a little. “There’s the normal stuff people report. Odd sounds in the woods. Eyes watching them in the dark. But compared to other big forests like this one, we don’t have too many local legends.”   

Chris appeared disappointed and he didn’t hide it.  

“I mean, there are some rumors of creatures in the woods, right?” He pressed.  

“Lately people near the forest have had reports of things getting stolen from their yard. A few have seen a pale person rushing back into the woods at night. The cops think it’s just someone on drugs stealing whatever isn’t nailed down to try and sell for their habit. Other than that, everything else can be explained by city people confusing animals at night for something else.”   

Chris opened his mouth to say something but the ranger went on.  

“Don’t you think that’s a bit weird though? That there’s nothing odd about this forest? I mean, everywhere has some sort of Bigfoot sighting or something along those lines. The fact this place is so damn normal is freaky in its own way.”  

The room fell silent. This wasn’t what Chris wanted to hear, at least, at first. Slowly a grin came over his face as a conspiracy brewed away in his head. He suddenly thanked the ranger and started to get us wrapped up. I found it a bit odd but didn’t question it.  

The plan for the rest of the day was to get shots of Chris and Conner talking in the woods about the topic of the video. But what was the topic? This place was normal. I didn’t think going after some backwoods addicts would be interesting enough to get views.  

“There is totally a cover-up happening,” Chris said his face flushed with excitement.  

I rolled my eyes. He didn’t notice. I watched the other two guys take out a drone to look it over. Once we got on the hiking trail the trees would be too dense for them to get the shots they wanted with it. They were so focused on their task; that they weren’t paying attention to Chris.  

“A cover-up for what exactly?” Conner asked sounding honestly curious.   

Chris made me start filming and then nodded at Conner to ask his question again so his answer would be in the video.  

“Maybe for a cult. It's just too odd for this place to have no urban legends. The local town is large enough for a school. And a school means kids. Have you ever heard of a bunch of kids not making up stories to scare each other?”  

Chris spoke as we walked down the trail. I had a hard time keeping the camera steady on the path. Sweat started to form on my forehead from the humid summer air. I was glad we were in the shade of the trees.  

“Again, for what reason?” Conner questioned.  

“I dunno, a cult?”   

We all raised our eyebrows at him.   

“I like the light here. Let's stop for a bit.” One of the girls said.  

For the next hour, we stopped and started again down the trail being directed by the girls trying to catch the best angle for Chris’ ramblings. He bounced from cults to police cover up, to even a secret government base hidden deep in the trees. For some reason, Conner wasn’t fully against the crazy ideas his friend was saying. The pair went back and forth discussing how such things would be possible.   

I did my job following along praying we wouldn’t be here for much longer. We didn’t meet anyone else on the trail. I saw someone off in the distance using a large walking stick. They didn’t slow down or turn around to tell us to quiet down and just kept hiking. The longer we walked, the hotter we got.   

A hint of an odd smell was carried on the breeze. The smell grew and the others took notice. It was a rotten and yet almost sweet scent.   

“Do you think a deer died near here?” One of the girls asked.  

I panned my camera around looking on the small screen. A white shape caught my eye and I zoomed in. My breath hitched as I realized what the source of the smell was.  

“It’s not a deer...” I said in a low voice.  

They all froze, concern on their faces. The forest grew dead silent aside from the breeze through the trees. Not even a bird sang. Oddly enough I wondered if I had heard any birds since we entered the woods.   

“Hey um...” I started looking at the two guys.  

“Ben.” He said with a nod.  

“Right, Ben, can you get the drone through the trees?”  

He and his friend, Pete, I think, silently went to work. None of us wanted to admit out loud what we were expecting to see. Saying it would make the situation far too real.  

“Why don’t we just walk over? Maybe they need help...” The girls offered.  

“We don’t want to disturb the scene.” Pete said already knowing what was a few feet away.  

So very carefully, they got the small drone up in the air and between the branches. Chris hovered to look over our shoulders at the shaking image on the screen. I didn’t want to see this and yet I felt oddly compelled. Soon, a white shape came into view. Only half of it was visible. At first, we assumed the bottom half of the body had been buried. The horrible truth became clear when the drone got closer.  

We had found the body of someone who had their bottom half either cut off or eaten off by some animal. The breeze stopped so only the sounds came from the drone.  

It wasn’t just the fact we found a body in that state. No, the body itself looked odd. The skin was a pale greyish hue. The man was missing his lips and eyelids. I squinted at the screen thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me. His ears and teeth appeared far too pointed to be human.  

“Let’s go back.” I said in a heavy voice.  

Everyone agreed. We marked the area where we stood with some string then started back the trail. We tied a string to trees so it would be easier for the rangers and the police to follow the route we took.  

The ranger we spoke with before had been outside the office building. He knew we had seen something based on our expressions. He waited until someone spoke up. I finally told him the basic run down knowing no one else wanted to say it.  

Shortly a pair of officers arrived. We told our story yet again and handed over the drone footage. I offered what I had on my camera, but they weren’t interested. I found that very odd. So did Chris but for once he didn’t say anything.  

Chris dismissed us for the day. I didn’t admit it to the others but I was scared as hell in those woods. Even before we found the body, the air inside those trees gave me the creeps.   

I showered off those feelings the moment I got home. I then started to upload the footage to my computer to send it off to Chris and be done with this entire ordeal. For a few days, I thought I would never be back near those woods.  

My phone rang and it was either my landlord saying the rent was overdue or a scam call.  

I groaned seeing it was neither of those things.  

“Hey, are you busy this weekend? I want to go back to Bird Song Park.” Chris said on the other end.  

“Yeah, booked up. But why would you want to go back there? Aside from some crackheads, there isn’t anything going on in those woods.” I said only half believing my own words.  

“There is something weird about that place. I contacted the police about what we found and they gave me nothing. I have connections and they can’t even find a case file.”  

I sighed getting ready to try to talk him down.  

“They’re small-time cops. They either have a slow old computer system or do everything on paper. Hell, they might not be the best at their job. I bet they’ve never dealt with a murder before. The most they’ve needed to handle are troublesome kids or a farmer getting too close to his sheep.”  

Chris snorted out a laugh at my last comment which made me warm up a little to him. I think if he wasn’t so weird we could be friends.  

“Yeah, maybe. I dunno. It all feels so... off. Listen, I might sound off the wall sometimes but I won’t believe anything without proof. I have a gut feeling there is something to find there. Me and the guys are going camping and poking around this weekend. Come along too. I’ll pay you. You don’t even need to hang out with us.”  

I chewed on the inside of my cheek debating on my answer. I hated camping. I hated the outside. And I felt a little bad Chris knew I didn’t want to be around him.  

“I’m not sure. I am busy...” I lied.  

“How much do you need? It's two to three days of work. What about three grand?” He offered as if that was nothing.  

My phone slipped a little from my hand as my mouth fell open. That would take care of my rent problem for a hot minute. I recovered and laughed at the crazy amount he just offered.  

“I’m more of a three grand per night type of gal.” I joke.  

“Ok, so nine for Friday, Saturday and Sunday?” He asked totally serious.  

I put my hand over my phone so he didn’t hear my suppressed scream.  How does this guy still have money? Isn't he making it too easy for people to take advantage of him?   

“Fine. I can ditch my plans for that much. But I’ll only accept the money if I give you something. I’m not saying I'll find proof some sort of monster ate the guy we found. But I’ll at least film some footage for your channel while I’m there and write up reports. Stuff like that.”  

This way I wouldn’t feel so bad taking his money. I was going to be a very overpaid assistant for a channel that didn’t even have a video up yet. Even after being offered such a large sum of money for basically just camping, I dreaded going back to those woods. Chris was right, there was something strange going on my logical brain couldn’t understand.  

That Friday I arrived at the ranger's office again this time alone. Chris and the guys were already in the woods picking out their campsite. Despite the nice weather, I didn’t see any other cars in the parking lot. I went inside the office to get checked in and to talk to the ranger to see if there had been any updates on the half-body case.  

He didn’t seem shocked to see me. The older ranger took one look and made an excuse he was going to the washroom so his partner was left alone in the room with me.  

“Sorry to bother you again ranger uh...”  

“Daniel.” He told me and held out a hand over the wooden counter for me to shake.  

At least he didn’t dislike us for simply poking around.  

“Do they know what happened to the person we found? We haven’t heard anything about it.”  

He shrugged not thinking finding half a body in the woods was a big deal.  

“Person got lost, died of exposure. Animals ate what they wanted. Case closed.”  

I raised an eyebrow at how easily he blew off my concerns.  

“Have they identified who he was?”  

He shook his head saying I would need to bring that up to the police. He was answering my questions but, in a way, I thought he wasn’t actually giving me any answers. Our conversation felt different than how he spoke with Chris during the interview.  

The office door opened and Daniel’s expression changed. An emotionless mask came over his face as if he was frightened of something and wanted to hide it. I turned my head to look at the newcomer.  

He was around my age. Despite the summer heat, he wore a large baggy grey sweater. A tall walking stick was in his hand. It had some twisting branches on top making it appear more like a fantasy staff. Each step was planned as he made his way over to the counter. His eyes remained directed towards the back wall of the office as if he wasn’t even aware I was there.  

“How are you today, Daniel? I’ve heard some new campers are setting up this weekend.” He spoke in a soft voice I bet would make girls swoon. He paused to lean an ear towards me and then slightly turned his head. “Is someone new here with us?”  

I noticed his pale eyes and awkwardly realized he was blind.  

“I’m friends with those campers,” I explained.  

He nodded and turned his head again back to the ranger.  

“Here, I washed them.”  

The newcomer placed a basket with plastic Tupperware on the counter. Daniel swiftly bent down and placed a new basket on the wooden surface for the man to take. It was covered by a cloth so I didn’t see what was inside.  

“Do you live in town?” I asked the man.  

Again, he directed his ear towards me instead of his eyes. It was a bit weird speaking with someone who didn’t make eye contact.  

“I live in the woods just down the trail. I pay the rangers to go into town to get goods for me.” He explained.  

If it was that simple, then why did Daniel seem so nervous around this man? The fact he lived in the woods caught my attention. He may be able to tell me more about the area and I could earn the money Chris was dumping into my lap. The newcomer took a step forward and I asked him to wait.  

“Can I walk with you?” I asked.  

He smiled at the suggestion and agreed. I requested to carry his basket finding it heavier than expected. I then offered him my arm to hold onto as we walked. I wasn’t sure if that was insulting or not. If he lived in these woods for a while he wouldn’t need a guide. But I always walked with my grandmother holding my elbow after she lost her eyesight. Thankfully he wasn’t offended and placed a hand on my arm.  

“Have my friends been bothering you at all?” I questioned when we started on the trail  

I was having issues walking on the uneven ground.  For the rougher patches, he acted like more of a guide than I did.  

“No. I just heard them once when they passed by. I don’t think they even noticed my cabin.” He replied carefully walking around larger rocks in the dirt trail.  

At least those guys weren’t acting like a nuisance to the locals. f For now.   

Silence came between us. I found it hard to think of a way to start questioning about the forest without being rude.  

“They’re going to get eaten alive out here.” He suddenly said.  

I stumbled in the dirt, my heart jumping to my throat. His calm voice saying such an intense statement made my skin crawl.  

“What do you mean...?” I slowly asked.  

He tilted his head slightly towards me, his eyes staring elsewhere.   

“It’s the reason why no one camps out here. We get a lot of rain so hundreds of small temporary ponds form. That means heavy mosquito activity. What did you think I meant?” The last part was in a playful tone.  

I frowned knowing he couldn’t see it. He got me for a second there.   

“We were the ones who found the body. It was missing the bottom half, so I thought you were talking about some sort of rabid animal.”  

His pace slowed a little. He felt a little bad for bringing up a terrible topic.  

“I don’t think we ever introduced ourselves.” He stated.  

“Oh, I’m Lee....” I responded and hesitated saying my full name.  

He sensed it and gave a few extra seconds waiting for it. When I didn’t keep talking he spoke again.  

“I go by Nikhil.”  

I looked him over trying to place where the name came from. Honestly, I don’t know much about other people’s cultures aside from the basic things. It’s not as if I didn’t respect others, I just wasn’t exposed enough to be aware of things outside of my community. His skin was dark but his hair was a bright light blonde that was almost white. I swore to look up the name when I got home.   

“Now that we’re friends, do you want to talk about what you saw? I bet it was a little bit frightening.”  

I wasn’t the shift in mood. I had been losing some sleep over what we found but I wouldn’t admit that to anyone. Well, anyone besides him it seems.  

“Yeah, it was a bit freaky. I don’t believe in the extreme things Chris does, but after being in these woods and finding that body it all just... doesn’t feel right. The body didn’t look natural...” I trailed off suddenly realizing it wasn’t in the best taste to say all this to someone who lived out here. “Do these woods scare you?”  

“Not at all.” Nikhil shook his head.  

That made me feel a little bit better. If he’s lived here without any issues then maybe what was happening was just a passing experience. I noticed him move his head as if he heard something off in the distance. I listened as well expecting to hear Chris and the others. Or anything at all.   

“It’s still a ten-minute walk to my place. Do you have somewhere else to be?”  

We had stopped in front of a footpath just big enough for two people to walk through. I glanced over my shoulder considering if I should find where the others had camped. I didn’t plan on staying the night. I wanted to only camp tomorrow night to avoid being on the ground for two nights in a row.  

“I can see you to your door.”  

Was that a poor choice of words? If so, Nikhil didn’t appear to mind.  We kept going talking a little bit more. The breeze picked up cooling my sweaty forehead. Then a distant rumble of thunder came. I looked at the sky through the trees to see it was still blue.  

We arrived at his small cabin carved out in a space in the middle of the woods. It was made of sturdy logs. Piles of chopped wood leaned against the side with a rusty axe stuck inside a stump. It looked like any respectable small cabin should aside from the solar panels on top that didn’t match the cozy cabin aesthetic.  

“It’s going to rain soon. You should stay here until it clears up.” Nikhil said after he opened the door and invited me inside.  

I shook my head then remembered he couldn’t see me.  

“If I walk fast, I should make it. Can I borrow an umbrella just in case?”  

He picked up one from inside and offered it. I thanked him and said I would leave it at the ranger's office for him to pick up later. He wished me luck and I started back off down the trail.  

I quickly found out the rain there was no joke. The storm rolled in fast. The wind picked up and shook the trees so hard it seemed like they would fall over. My umbrella was useless in such powerful winds. The rain came down in large drops it became impossible to see. I didn’t know how long of a walk it would take to reach the office. I couldn’t see the trail in front of my feet. This wasn’t good. Without any other choice, I needed to turn back.  

Nikhil knew where I would end up. He had a towel and a change of dry clothing ready for me the moment I got inside.  

“This storm is insane.” I sputtered out.  

“Yes, they can be. Are your friends safe?”  

I frantically took out my dripping-wet phone. To my dismay, it refused to turn on.   

“You wouldn’t happen to have any rice in that basket?” I asked.  

“No, just human flesh offerings.” He shrugged.  

He kept his tone too even when he made jokes. It freaked me out. When I didn’t laugh, he shook his head.  

“I’m fresh out of rice. I should have asked for some but I was craving something else.”  

He walked over to the table where he put the basket and pulled out a clear plastic bag with some hunks of bloody meat inside.  

“It sounds gross but I love cow tongue. Oh, and I have some pig trotters too.”  

“Trotters?” I asked.  

He raised his hands in front of him and mimicked little hooved feet walking.  

“You know, trotters.”  

I couldn’t hold back my laughter. Then I jumped when a burst of thunder shook the cabin. If the storm got stronger it could do serious damage. I was lucky I turned back when I did. Nikhil offered to make a hot meal but I refused already feeling bad enough that I crashed at his place.  

Even though I knew he couldn’t see, I got changed into dry clothing inside the cramped bathroom. The cabin had a main room, a bathroom, and a small door set into the floor I assumed to be a storage space. There weren’t many sitting options so I sat at the edge of his bed looking outside at the raging storm.  

Were the guys doing ok in this? Maybe they made it back to the ranger’s office. Trees bent under the winds and heavy rain. It was almost too dark to see outside aside from flashes of light. Nikhil cooked his dinner and it warmed the small room. He had picked up an iPad to start an audiobook while he cooked.  

It felt oddly cozy despite being in a stranger’s place. I refused food and yet he placed a plate with a sandwich next to me after he had eaten. For a while, I forgot the reason why I was even there. It really felt as if nothing stranger ever happened in Bird Song Park.  

Hours passed and the storm started to let up a little.   

“I should get going.” I offered.  

“It’s still raining and dark out. You should stay the night.”  

I frowned feeling conflicted. I didn’t want to overstay my welcome but I also didn’t want to put on my wet and cold shoes to get back to my car. Plus, I would need to get a hotel in town. And I’ve seen those hotels. A cabin in the middle of the woods would be a cleaner place to stay.  

“I should at least get to the office and check on Chris and the others. Do you have a flashlight?”  

I mentally kicked myself after I asked. Why would a blind man own a flashlight? Oddly enough he nodded and opened the small door to slip under the floor to his storage space. He tossed up a heavy-duty camping backpack that had been stained with dirt. He opened it and dumped out the contents. My face flushed when women's undergarments landed on the top of the clothing pile. Why would he have a bag that clearly didn’t belong to him?  

“Does this lantern work?” He asked holding up a battery powers hand lantern.  

I tested it thinking about the best way to ask about the bag.   

“Sometimes people leave stuff behind because they either don’t want to carry it or just forget. I store things like this for the rangers.” He explained shoving the clothing back inside.  

I didn’t think anyone would leave their full bag either on purpose or they forgot. That train of thought was derailed when he picked up a pair of black underwear and paused.  

“These are kinda too sexy for a camping trip. Was she trying to romance Bigfoot or something?” He said and teasingly lifted them near me.  

I laughed again and pushed his hand away. We had been listening to a crime drama as we waited out the storm. I bet he had spicier audiobooks on that iPad.  

A sudden pounding at the door made my heart jump into my chest. Nikhil abandoned the clothing to rush to the door for two people to pile inside.   

“Chris! Conner!” I rushed over to them  

They were wide-eyed and soaking wet. Conner had a long bleeding scratch over his face and his shirt had been ripped at the bottom as if someone had grabbed and pulled hard on it. Chris held tightly onto a small metal baseball bat he had brought along on their camping trip for some sort of protection.  

Nikhil was able to guide Conner to sit down and got to work finding a first aid kit. Chris was sputtering unable to get a full thought out.  

“The guys... They’re still... I need to go.” He turned on his heels and rushed back outside.  

I followed behind him, lantern in hand. I shouted to him to come back. He either didn’t hear me or refused to listen. I grabbed the axe by the firewood and chased after my friend ignoring that now Nikhil called out for us to wait until it stopped raining.  

The storm died down to a slight drizzle. I was still soaked a few minutes into going into the woods. I soon realized what kind of mistake I just made. I didn’t see the light of the cabin or any signs of Chris. My dumb actions just got me lost in the woods and I wasn’t helping anyone.  

I yelled for Chris or anyone to tell me where they were. A voice in the distance echoed through the trees.  

“Help!”  

I bolted towards the sound of Chris in trouble. My feet slipped on the wet ground. I followed his voice through the dark trees getting hit with branches on the way. Soon I came to a clearing with a person standing beside a tree. Lifting the lantern, I squinted in the dark trying to get a better view of them.  

“Chris?” I asked breathing hard.  

The person turned their head towards me. Their pale white eyes reflected the light back. I gasped because they looked like the corpses we found. Same grey skin and pointed teeth. The body was dressed in piles of rags and the smell hit me. It let out a screech and charged towards in my direction, teeth and claws ready to rip open my flesh.  

My arm acted on its own. The axe came down into the creature’s skull. The body collapsed twitching to the ground as thick black blood flowed from the wound.   

I stood in shock at what just happened not believing my eyes. Then fear came over me as I wondered how many more of these things waited in the dark.  

I heard voices again and debated on if it was a trap. This creature clearly used Chris’ voice to get me over here. It took some effort but I took the axe from the monster’s skull to go towards the voices. I hoped it wasn’t a trap and if it was, I could fight my way out of it.  

Thankfully I saw someone human. Ranger Daniel and Chris were standing on a trail. The ranger trying to get Chris to calm down and come back with him.  

“Chris, are you alright?” I asked him in a breathless voice.  

“Ben and Pete are still out here! Those things... We ran but they still could be alright!” He gasped on the verge of a panic attack.  

“I’ll look for them, but you need to get to the cabin. It’ll be safe there and it’s closer to the office. I can’t find your friends and deal with you at the same time.” Daniel said.  

Chris looked away ashamed of himself. Not only did he drag his friends into the woods, he couldn’t help them.   

“I’ll take him back.” I offered.  

“Give us a gun. You have two.” Chris demanded from the ranger.  

Daniel gave us a hard look.  

“Hold out your right hand.” He told us.  

We listened. Chris wasn’t able to keep his hand steady while mine was. I was just as scared as he looked, but my body didn’t react in the same way.  I wondered if I had been able to act this calm in the past then I wouldn’t have gotten fired from my previous job and ended up here. The ranger handed me a pistol ensuring the safety was on.  

He made a promise of finding the two lost campers and ordered us back to the cabin. Chris held the lantern so I could have a hand ready to draw the borrowed pistol if needed.  

“I’m sorry.” Chris said sounding like a child.  

He shook from fear and the cold rain. It started to come down harder making me keep wiping water out of my eyes.  

“I don’t blame you. There is no way you could have known this would happen.” I said.  

He shook his head not accepting my words.  

“I knew something was wrong about this place but I still made us come here....”  

We walked in silence for a while. The cabin started to come into view and Chris calmed down a little.  

“Why did he tell us to come here? Wouldn’t going back to the cars and leaving for help be the better idea?” He asked as the thought came to him.  

We both hadn’t been thinking clearly until then. Why did he say to come back to the cabin? Surely one of those things could easily break inside. We still knocked on the door and were let inside by a shell-shocked Conner.  

“Ben...” He said in a whisper.  

At some point, someone had dragged the other man inside leaving a trail of rainwater on the floor. Chris collapsed next to his side nearly hysterical over how bad of shape Ben was in. We all knew he wasn’t going to last until help arrived. His body was covered with so many claw and bite marks. He lost far too much blood and his body temperature had gone way down from the rain.  

“Where’s Nikhil?” I asked realizing he wasn’t inside.  

“He...” Conner started and got too choked up to continue for a moment. “He left after you. Brought Ben inside but... those things grabbed him. I...”  

Conner was blaming himself for not being able to help.  However, I didn’t fault him for staying inside. One person still living was better than stupidly going after a lost cause. I gritted my teeth hating my choices. I knew the odds of Nikhil being still alive. And yet...  

“I’m going after them.” I said and turned towards the door.  

They didn’t stop me, but both looked at the gun in my waistband. They had weapons like knives inside the cabin, but it didn’t feel right to leave them alone without them. I made sure they were aware of how dangerous it was for an inexperienced person to handle a pistol. If we weren’t in this kind of situation, I wouldn’t have considered it. I told them to treat it as a last option and to do their very best to not shoot each other or themselves. I still worried for them.  

Conner handed over a flashlight that was better than the lantern. I told them if I couldn’t find any signs of Nikhil, I was going to go down to the office to call for help. Neither of them had their phones on them and mine still wasn’t working. I doubted good ranger Daniel was enough to deal with whatever was going on inside this forest.  

I left the cabin determined to make sure no one else got hurt that night.
