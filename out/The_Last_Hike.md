 

I was puffing and panting from the exertion of setting up the tent. I had practiced in our backyard, and it was hard there, especially after I realised from the twitch of her bedroom curtains that mom was watching me. Now, in the real place, with the fresh breeze and scent of forest behind me, under the glow of the city-free sun and sky, it was harder.

I wondered how hard it had been for Anna, my sister. It was her tent. It would have been different for her, of course, she had had a friend with her.

Fat lot of good it did both of them. Just as well I was alone.

Eventually the tent was up. It looked much smaller than it had in our backyard. I shivered. This was the spot they had spent their last night.

I couldn’t be sure it was the exact spot they had pitched the tent, of course, but I knew I was in the same grassy enclosure where the murders took place.

It was so beautiful. The newspapers describing it as a “paradisical ring of grass” had not been exaggerating. Now, cupping the late afternoon mountain sun, the shadows not yet lengthening, it was brimming with gold light, and it was so, so, so very hard to believe anything terrible had happened here.

I was alone, which was gratifying. Just like the night Anna and her friend were murdered. It was the Appalachian Trail after all, usually, there would be other people, but that particular summer evening, there was no-one else. But this was the AT, you met up with people, then fell apart, then met up again.

The tent smelled from being bundled in the basement for ten years, but the woodsy air would soon take care of that. I stepped back and looked proudly at my handiwork, and then peered closer. Were those blood stains on the canvas? I blinked, and for the first time since I had started the hike, felt a slight shiver of fear, deep in my heart. I had imagined this tent so much growing up, and I knew I must be confusing reality with imagined memories.

Everything had been cleaned- I’m not sure how I knew that, but I remember hearing those words spoken to my mother by someone at the door.

I had been eight when Anna had been murdered. In this very tent, in this grassy circle in the heart of the AT.

I had grown up under the shadow of Anna’s murder. For the longest while I didn’t understand what happened- just that there was no Anna- whom I didn’t see much of anyway due to the age difference and her outdoorsy interests. I had a clear sharp memory of her- she had stepped in to break up some neighbourhood kids who were bothering me, and I remember looking up at her as she yelled at the kids to get lost, her hair and eyes and face so clear, glowing against the backdrop of houses and tame city trees.

After the murder, no-one bothered me, or had much to do with me.

Dad left. And mom was always ill.

Eventually I found out. Anna and her friend had been hiking the Appalachian Trail, like thousands of other people. They had set up tent in this spot- this paradisical grassy circle enclosed by the woods.

Their bodies were discovered by a fellow hiker later that morning. Their throats had been slashed. The murderer was never found.

I became obsessed. Not that I wanted to “solve” the murder, rather, I wanted to absorb it.

And then the time came. I was eighteen and could finally do the thing I had been wanting to do since I found out about Anna, the only thing.

Mom couldn’t stop me- she didn’t care about me or anything I did anyway. She didn’t even notice me dragging Anna’s old hiking gear from the basement.

I told her I was going hiking with some friends. I expected her to remonstrate- or ask me who I was with, or where I was going. She stared at me like she had seen ghost, looking through me, like she always had these long past years.

Then she smiled palely. “Please don’t get killed.”

I knew about graveyard humour, and replied in kind. “I’ll try.” Then I left, slightly slouching under Anna’s heavy backpack. An hour later, I was on the AT.  

Now I bent low to crawl into the tent. I hadn’t eaten much, but I wasn’t hungry. In the shifting evening light, the stains were no longer visible. I blinked again, and the fear seemed to move within me. I entered the tent.

Anna was in the tent, but I wasn’t scared of her.

I couldn’t remember much about my adventurous older sister, just that time when Anna had yelled at those kids and told them to knock it off- I was scared then. Now Anna was with me again and I wasn’t scared at all. I told Anna about our mom and dad. She was sorry she hadn’t been there for me, and I had to grow up by myself. I can’t describe how we communicated, just know that there are ways of talking which transcend our physical senses.

The night passed in healing, the forest murmuring outside.

I got up early, the sun dazzling my eyes. Anna had left. I felt at peace as I never had before, not for one second in the past ten years, and I knew Anna felt the same. I unfurled the tent efficiently, and began the hike home. I didn’t need to be on the AT anymore.

The house was quiet when I arrived, I was used to that.

But it took me a second to realise this was a different sort of quiet. The fear which had been smouldering low in my heart suddenly blazed in that same second and I gasped out loud. “Mom!” I called out. “Mom!”

Without knowing why, I rushed to the bathroom. The door was locked from the inside. Shaking from terror I banged at the door and screamed.

Eventually -not sure how long it took, or how they were- but some people came into the house, and broke the bathroom door down.

There was mom curled on the bathroom floor in a pool of dried rusty blood, still clutching the knife she had used to slash her throat.
