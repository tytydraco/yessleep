About 7 years ago I was supposed to have a baby sister, Aria. Of course me and my parents were ecstatic. My mom always wanted a daughter, and I wanted a sibling in general to share memories with. And of course I just wanted a playmate. However, just hours after Aria was born, the doctor came in and gave us the worst news one can hear

Aria was stillborn

I remember it vividly. My mom was screaming and crying, begging the doctor to tell her it was all one big prank. My dad just solemnly looked down and I could see his lips quivering. I was on the verge of tears. My future sibling who I was supposed to spend my entire life with, share memories with, and play with, just died right there.

Now I'm 18, and getting ready for college. Recently I just got accepted into Dartmouth University, and I'm extremely excited to go. However, my mom was hit pretty hard after Aria's death. She's turned to drinking for comfort, and now she's more prone to anger. She began to snap at me and my dad more, and she spent most of her days watching videos of me as a kid. My dad thought she has depression. I mean, seven years later and she's still mourning the death of Aria. To me, I think it's a normal reaction. We all grieve in different ways right?

The weirdness started about a week ago. I was sitting in the living room, watching TV, when my mom came bursting in with something in her arms. Whatever it was, it was covered in blankets, similar to a baby.

"What's that?" I asked, confused. My mom just looked at me, and a crazy smile appeared on her face.

"Aria" She said. "This is Jake. Your brother"

Instantly I dropped my remote. I stood up slowly, and tears were running down my face.

"Where did you get that baby?" I asked, slowly backing away.

"What are you talking about?" My mom said in a sweet voice. "This is your sister,"I was scared out of my mind, so I spent the rest of the day in my room, locking the door and not making a single noise. Downstairs, I could hear my mom cradling the baby, holding it and singing lullabies to it. Once my dad got home, I could hear him yelling at my mom

"Are you fucking crazy?!" My dad yelled at my mom. "You took a random baby from the hospital?!"

"Honey this is our kid" I could hear my mom say "This is our Aria"

"Lila, Aria's dead. Why can't you just accept that?!" My dad was yelling. There was a sudden yell, and I heard a thump. I slowly crept up to the stair railing and saw my dad crawling away, a blood trail following him as my mom slowly walked behind him with a shard of glass from the flower vase. I could only watch in horror, as my mom lifted my dad up by the hair, and slit his throat. The blood filled up the entire room, and my mom saw me.

"Jake! Help me clean this up! Your sister spilled something!" My mom demanded. I slowly went downstairs and began cleaning the blood, too scared to confront my mom.

Over the next few days, my mom's condition was worsening. Every night I could hear her stand by my bedroom door. I began keeping my switchblade knife my dad gave me by my nightstand every night. Throughout all this, my mom continued feeding this baby, pampering it, changing its diaper. And every time she needed me, she barged into my room, grabbed me by my hair, and threw me down the stairs, before ordering me to do whatever she needed me to do. She called my high school a few days ago and told them that I had gone to college early and that I wouldn't be available for prom or graduation.

Yesterday was the worst of it. My mom, as usual, barged in and told me it was dinner. However, when I got to the table, I was about ready to puke. There was a bowl, of what appeared to be blood, staring right back at me. I could make out a few bones as well. My mom grinned and handed me a spoon

"Eat up sweetie" she said. I shakily took the spoon.

"I'm...not hungry" I said slowly.   
"EAT IT!" My mom yelled, and I could see the veins popping out of her neck. Scared, I tried not to gag as I drank this red blood like concoction. As soon as I got upstairs, I puked for a hour straight. I could hear my mom singing lullabies to the baby as I did so. I spent the rest of the night eating my entire cup ramen storage, trying to flush out the concoction. 

As I'm writing this, I'm currently packing my bags to escape my mom. I don't want to leave the baby behind, but I have no choice on the matter. I'm hoping to escape, because if I don't, God knows what my mom will do to me.
