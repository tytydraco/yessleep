I was 16 when this story took place. I don't remember much now that I'm 25 but I do remember this day vividly. I was cleaning out my grandma's house a couple of days after she died. It was pretty normal until my brother who was helping me clean the house up, went to get food for the both of us leaving the house just for me. Now I wanted to finish the job today, after all, there were just a couple of rooms left. So I continued working. When I was about to finish the last room I heard something in the upstairs hallway. I curiously looked up there before shrugging it off and continued working on the last couple of items in the drawer I was cleaning up. But the noise happened again but this time louder. I sighed and put the framed photograph I found in the drawer down and started walking up the stairs to investigate what the noise was.

When I fully got upstairs I saw the attic stairs fully down. I looked it up and down before quickly concluding that the ladder hit the floor and that is what was making the banging noise. I looked around upstairs a bit just to be safe and make sure there were no intruders before finally making my way up into the attic. The attic at first seemed like another regular attic. dusty, filled with boxes, and occasionally spiders. I searched around the attic a bit before deciding to open a box labeled Memories of Family and Friends. The first thing I saw in the box was a photo book filled with photos of my grandma and my grandpa, sometimes with friends or family. I went through that a little bit before stumbling upon an old Polaroid camera in the box. Under the camera was an old dusty Polaroid 

I picked the Polaroid up and looked at the photo. It just seemed like any other regular photo with my grandpa and my grandma sitting on a couch together smiling. I smiled at it before realizing something was wrong. Behind the couch was a completely dark shadow of a person standing over my grandma with his hand on her head smiling. I looked at it for a couple of seconds then out of nowhere the Polaroid camera went off. It was still in the box so I freaked out and backed away from it. After a minute or two of silence and nothing happening, I walked over to the box and picked up the Polaroid that had come out of the camera. I started shaking it as much as I could, eager to see the results. When the photo finally showed up I stopped. the angle in the photo wasn't even where the camera was. It was behind me. 

I turned around quickly, not very excited to see what was behind me. Nothing was, there was nobody in sight and not a single thing changed from when I last looked over there. CLICK the sound came from the box again signaling that the camera went off. I gulped and walked over there picking up the Polaroid picture again and waiting for it to develop. This time it was right in front of me, maybe just a few feet away. I saw myself just looking at the back from where the angle of the first photo came from. I looked at the photo a bit more before realizing that there was something there and I was looking right at it. From where the first photo came from was a black figure looking at me smiling.

I didn't waste a single second and just ran, dropping everything in my hands and running out of the attic. Once I got out of the attic I hurried up and closed it shut and sighed a sigh of relief. I turned around to quickly exit the house and just wait outside for my brother but right at the beginning of the stairs was a Polaroid picture. I walked over to it carefully and picked it up. On the back of the picture, it said in some red crayon "behind you", the handwriting looked like it belonged to a child. I didn't even bother to look behind me but when I saw the picture itself I wanted to scream. It showed me standing at the stare well but the same thing that had its hand on my grandma's head was right behind me. I was about to scream but I couldn't, I couldn't even open my mouth. I felt the breath it took behind my back and how its hands were rubbing up and down my back. That was my last thought before I was presumably shoved down the stairs and passed out from head trauma 

I woke up in the hospital a couple of days later. I tried to tell my brother and the hospital staff but none of them listened and thought I was crazy. My brother even claimed there was no attic in Grandma's house and that I probably dreamed of it. To this day I remember everything that happened that night and I will probably never forget.
