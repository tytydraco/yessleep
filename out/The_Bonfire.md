I should have listened to Padre Jose. I should have stayed focused during the sermon instead of catching Catalina’s eye from across the pews, grinning like a fool every time she glanced back. But no, I had to be the charming rebel. The smirks, the stolen looks, all of it felt innocent and playful. What harm could there be in love, right?

“Did you like the sermon today. I put a lot of thought into it,” Padre Jose asked me at the door, his hand warm as he gripped mine.

“Yes I did Padre Jose, it was very good.”

“What did you like about it specifically.”

“Um, all of it, it was very inspirational,” I stammered.

“Thank you for saying so my son, just remember, I see all from the pulpit and you will learn more about God from me than from your girlfriend.”

I looked down, burning with embarrassment.

Catalina heard him too. She was by the hitching post, arms folded, trying to hide her smile. I walked up to her trying to hide mine.

“Have you given any more thought to my proposal,” I asked, trying not to sound as desperate as I felt.

“I have, but the Apache are attacking Albuquerque, and the Navaho are attacking Santa Fe, how do we know if we will be safe.”

“Because mi amor, the Apache do not attack as far north as my brother’s ranch and the Navaho do not go on that land, they think it is cursed. We will be all right there.”

Her eyes searched mine, terrified and elated.  “Yes, I will go with you.”

We married the next month.

Life on the ranch was not easy. The adobe house was practical, nothing more. Three years of dirt, sheep, and quiet nights. We shared a wall with the sheep enclosure. It smelled like wool and manure, but we were together. That was enough.

Until her birthday.

I had saved up for months to surprise her with that bowl; the iridescent one we saw in Santa Fe. It shimmered like oil in water, purple and blue dancing under the sun. Catalina gasped when she unwrapped it, called it the prettiest thing she had ever seen. Her eyes glistened. That made it all worth it.

I broke my brother’s main rule and lit a bonfire that night to celebrate her birthday. The lamb was roasting, the sky was clean, stars endless and uncaring. Catalina went inside to find a place for her new treasure.

That was when I saw them.

Eyes. Yellow. Too high off the ground to be a coyote. Not an owl either. Perrito, my ranch dog, had been growling low all evening, but now he backed away, tail tucked. I wanted to go inside but then who would watch the sheep. Perrito was being useless.

I threw a stick at the eyes. They shut. Heavy steps. Not away, just repositioning. Then open again. Closer. A new smell now, like the day after butchering day.

Catalina came out, beaming.  “I found a good place…”

“Go back inside, actually get my gun,” I interrupted, trying to sound calm.

She did not argue, just quickly returned with my musket.

The eyes had come closer. A shape now. Not a bear. Not anything I could name. My heart thudded as it stared.

And then, it spoke.

“Why did you not pay attention in church, Fernando.”  The voice of Padre Jose.

Catalina screamed. Her whole body jerked backward.

“You should have paid attention.”  Again, Padre Jose’s voice. Calm. Near.

Catalina was trembling, voice shaking.  “We need to go in.”

“All right.”  But as we moved to the door, my door, I got mad, I didn’t ask for this, and I did not think. I raised the rifle and fired.

The shot split the silence. The eyes disappeared.

I pulled Catalina inside, slammed the door shut. I hoped it was over.

But then the sheep started screaming.

By morning, they were all dead. Torn apart like paper dolls. Nothing left but ruined bodies.

And Catalina was burning up, her skin gray and slick with sweat.

Before she slipped into a restless sleep, she whispered, “Do not stare into its eyes.”

By the time I had buried what was left of the sheep and got Catalina something to drink, she was barely conscious. Her skin was damp and cold, though she burned with fever. I pressed a wet cloth to her head, whispering fervent prayers.

I wanted to take her to a doctor. The nearest town was seven hours by wagon. But the burro was dead too, ribs torn open like a rotten fruit.

By the time I had our supplies packed it was two in the afternoon. I would not make it far. I told myself it would be better to rest and start at dawn. Maybe it would forget about us. Maybe it only came when the fire was lit.

So, I did not light one.

The dark settled in heavy and quiet. No coyotes howled. Even the crickets held their breath.

At nine thirty the last light vanished behind the hills.

At ten o’clock it started again.

“Fernando,” said the voice of Padre Jose, soft and pious. “Come out and pray with me. If you had listened in church, you would know how.”

Catalina whimpered. She was awake, barely. I crouched by the window, musket loaded again, though I doubted it would help.

Then, the voice again, closer.  “Come out if you want to get your dog.”

My stomach turned. I had buried Perrito. I had seen the flies.

Rage surged through me. I threw open the window and fired.  The flash briefly lit a shape, something tall, human but not. Cloaked. No face.

Then silence.

As I reloaded, the sound began.  Claws on adobe.  Slow, dragging scratches.  Whatever it was, it circled the house, tracing its claws along the walls like a child running a hand across a fence.

It stopped at the door.  Three knocks. Polite.

“I just want to come in and bless your house,” it said, in Padre Jose’s voice. Serene. Holy. Mocking.

“No, you do not. You are bad,” I shouted.

The scratching started again, deeper now. Wood splintered with each slow drag. It was burrowing through the door.

Catalina was beside me now, pale as the moon, leaning on the wall.

“Mi amor, it is digging through the door,” I said, powerless.

“I will offer it some food. Maybe it will go away then.”

“What. No, you need to lie down.”

“Where is the basket. I have some tortillas and stew I can offer it.”

“In the corral, but you can not…”

“That is all right. I will use my new bowl,” she said softly.

She lifted the shimmering bowl from the shelf as if it were sacred, and filled it gently, hands shaking.

“I do not think this is a good idea,” I whispered.

“It will be through the door in a moment,” she said. “This is our only idea.”

The scraping stopped. It was listening.

Catalina lifted the door latch.  The night sucked inward like a breath.

She stepped out, holding the bowl like an offering.

I was right behind her.

“I am coming out with food,” she said.

Silence.

Then, in Padre Jose’s voice: “Then bring it.”

We turned left.

A figure stood just past the threshold of light. It looked like a Navaho elder, robed, unmoving.

For a heartbeat, everything froze.

Then it moved.

Fast as lightning it struck the bowl, which burst into a thousand pieces and flew out into the yard.

And then it was on us.

There are things the body remembers long after the mind stops. The sound Catalina made when the bowl shattered was not a scream, it was breath torn out of her. Sharp and final.

Then the night opened up. Something surged forward.  I could not fight it. No weapon was fast enough. No words were holy enough.

It did not just kill us.  It obliterated us.  And yet, somehow, I remember.

I remember the moment the pieces of the bowl hit the ground and exploded into dust. The land itself seemed to shiver. Like something old had been disturbed.

The creature, the Skinwalker, moved too fast for Catalina to react. Her body collapsed like a rag doll next to the ruined offering.

I turned and tried to run.  Claws tore through my back.  Blood filled my mouth.

But the worst part, the final horror, was the voice.

Still Padre Jose’s. Still calm.

“There was an agreement. No home was to be raised here while the rivers flowed.”

That was the last thing I heard.

Not the wind.  Not Catalina’s voice.  Not even my own breath.

Just that voice, as if it had always been here.

Fast forward one hundred and sixty seven years.

A man named David is hiking north of Albuquerque, looking for an old ghost town he saw mentioned on a forum. His boots crunch through brittle grass.

He finds nothing from the forum.

But ahead is a shape, an adobe ruin, slumped and half melted by time.  He walks toward it.

Then he sees them, bits of glass, half buried in the earth. Purple. Blue. Iridescent. Sunlight catches them like tiny bits of amethyst.

The nearby doorframe is carved with deep parallel gouges. Too deep. Too clean. Nothing out here does that.

David stands very still.  Something about the air feels wrong.

He backs away.  He does not go inside.  He does not touch the glass.

The wind shifts. It feels colder now.  He assumes he is still cold from the river he had to cross.

David turns around.  He walks away.  And he does not look back.  Not once.
