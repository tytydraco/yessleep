If you’re reading this, then that means my court case is about to end and that my lawyer has honored my wishes to publicize my side of the story. It also likely means that my lawyer has low hopes that the jury will side in my favor. I would say that I want this document to be released because I don’t care about my own innocence. I simply want the truth to be told, But that’s not true. I am innocent, I want the truth to be out there, and I want the world to know that I didn’t kill my wife.

If you read this and decide for yourself that this story sounds like a madman trying to get across his innocence, that’s fine, but everything that happened to me and her was true. Even if I myself still don’t know all the details. If you believe me and look into what happened, don’t go into the Lake Moorshore Woods alone, it's not safe.  With that in mind, I suppose I should explain what happened from the beginning. 

My name is Trevor Michaels, and 7 months ago my wife Abby’s father passed away. She was absolutely destroyed by his death; in a way few words can really explain. Her mother passed away when she was 5 and since then her father was the only family that she had ever had in her life before we met. We knew each other in high school while I was on the football team, she was a cheerleader. I noticed her because she had this beautiful jet-black hair and wispy blue eyes. She noticed me because I was the biggest guy on the team. She was so happy then.  We were so happy, so seeing her stewing in a silent choking pain when she heard that her father had that stroke broke my heart.

She was silent for a long time; I want to say she didn’t speak for almost a month until her father’s funeral. A part of me blamed myself for how distraught she was over his death. When I left for the military 6 years ago, she was left alone again… except for her father. Sure, we communicated as often as we could, but she visited that man every single day and frankly, he was the kindest man I'd ever met. That year of my deployment was what really made me realize just how much my wife relied on her father. After he died, I promised her and myself that I’d never leave her side ever again.

We held the funeral at Lake Mooreshore, they had a beautiful church hall near the edge of the woods facing the lake that made the funeral a more peaceful gathering.  It was fall, the sky was grey, leaves had canvased the ground in a blanket of crunchy brown and orange, and my wife… disappeared. It was around the end of the service when everyone was saying their personal condolences and grabbing their belongings when I realized that my wife was nowhere to be found. I had been saying goodbye to her father’s brother-in-law before I noticed.

She had been in such a terrible state in the time spanning before the funeral that I was worried she had done something drastic, so I ran out of the hall to look for her in a frenzy. I noticed a trail in the leaves leading into the woods and followed them. It was maybe a good 15 minutes of running at a full sprint before I heard something coming from the woods. It was Abby’s voice, breaking and crying. Still too far for me to hear exactly what she was saying, but I caught something that sounded along the lines of: “I just want to be happy again… please make me happy again.” I found her standing in the thicket surrounded by trees on all sides. She was looking at the ground, just standing there swaying in the wind perfectly still. She had stopped crying.

 

 I trotted up beside her slowly beside her and put my hand on her shoulder, asking if she was alright. She didn’t say anything, she just shook her head yes. I turned to face her, and her face was empty. Her eyes were a hollow sadness with tears just streaming out but her expression was just blank, occasionally twitching. I choked back tears and took her hand, wanting to lead her back to the funeral hall. As we were walking back, I noticed there was something on the back of her head. It was blood, thick and sticky on her neck. I asked her panicked if she was alright and went to check her head. I assumed at the time that she had maybe fallen on the way out here but as my arm moved for her head, she shot her arm out and swiped my hand away. She just said “I’m fine. I want to go home.”  All the while still looking at the ground. Her hair had draped over her face like a veil.  I assumed that she was of sound enough mind to know if she needed to see a doctor, so I listened to her request and left it be.

We went back to the hall, finished the funeral, and went home. I wish I had realized just what had happened at the time. If I did maybe I could have done something more to help her before things had gotten so bad, But I was blinded by her grief and pushed on despite the signs.  As the weeks passed following the funeral of her father, Abby began to improve in a way that honestly threw me off. Where before she was a person who had been physically and mentally hollowed out as a human, now she was full of so much life. She was happy, in a way I couldn’t quite understand.

We started going outside again, going to new places, trying new things. At first, I was worried she was doing this to just mask her grief but after a while, it felt as though she was truly just happy again. We’d spend our mornings exploring the open world Abby had closed herself off from and at night we’d spend our time together on the couch and watching movies. However, I noticed that when we had those moments or when we slept together, she had this tendency to sit or sleep far away from me. Whether it be on the other side of the couch or on the other side of the bed, always facing me. I assumed that maybe she just wasn’t ready for physical contact yet after what had happened and never pushed it further, however, it was something that always bothered me every night.

One morning, I woke up to see that she was gone from our bed, I heard the shower going in the other room. As I went to get up, I noticed that there was hair on her pillow, a large clump of it matted to the cloth with a viscous brown residue slinging it together. I shot up from the bed and asked her through the door of the bathroom if she was alright. As I did, the door to the bathroom opened and she walked out, saying she was fine and asked why. I explained to her the hair I found on the pillow, and she said that she changed the shampoo recently and that it “must have been reacting poorly to her hair.” She kissed me on the cheek and back peddled into the bedroom to get dressed. I walked into the bathroom and looked at the bath. In the shower, the drain had even more globed-up hair.

As time passed more strange things kept happening, only in a slow drawn-out way. The next month I was sitting on the couch reading my tablet when she walked in to ask me something, as she did, she stubbed her foot into the corner of the doorframe. Hard. I heard a cracking sound and stood to check if she was alright. But she was smiling, just saying that she had stubbed her toe and that it was no big deal. I looked down and saw blood begin to widen on her white sock. I told her to take it off and let me check but she waved it away saying, “It’s fine Hun, I probably just broke the skin a little bit.” Just dismissed me outright and walked off.  

Things like this just kept happening. As days went on more and more cuts and bruises would pop up on her skin. Bruises on her thighs, her hips, cuts on her hands and feet. They varied in severity, but she just refused to let me check on her or even go to the doctor. I couldn’t force her to get help. I started to worry that she was starting to commit self-harm, it didn’t help that one day I walked past the bathroom and noticed she was standing in front of the mirror doing something with her thumb. She was just looking at herself in the mirror, her hair was draped over her face and her eyes were locked on to her reflection. When I looked down at her hand, I realized that she had been scratching at her thumb with her forefinger.  She had managed to scratch past the skin and was bleeding down into the sink.

When I realized what she did I went to walk to her and see if she was ok. Before I could get to her, she saw me in the mirror and used her foot to close the door to the bathroom, looking at me through her hair in the mirror as she did. I begged her through the door to tell me what was wrong, what she had done to herself. She just told me “Honey I don’t know what you’re so worried about. I’m fine, I feel great. Can’t you see that?” minutes passed before she turned off the lights and opened the door. She had bandaged her hand. That night we sat down on the couch and had a long conversation about her well-being.

She insisted that she was ok, but I refused to back down that she had been hurting herself and insisted she see a therapist. She told me “If it’ll make you feel better, I’ll look into it. But I really think you're blowing this out of proportion.”  That night we didn’t talk much and went to bed yet again not touching each other at all. It had been like this for 4 months. For a few days I had let the issue go thinking she was upholding her end of the “deal”, but things got worse.

I noticed that she hadn’t been eating as much. We’d eat breakfast or dinner and I'd notice no matter how big or small the meal shed only eat maybe half of what was made. Shed began to grow skinny and gaunt. We started to go outside less, and she’d spend hours just wrapped up in a blanket in our bed.  Her skin started to get so pale. Before she looked so vibrant and bright but now, she looked so sickly and gaunt. Her hair would just keep falling out with this thick brown residue in clumps, it was so thin now. It was killing me to see her spiral. I had assumed the depression from her father’s passing had returned but oddly enough every time I saw her, she was…smiling. Smiling in a way that seemed so, unnaturally happy. Not in a fake happy way or a crazily happy way. I mean genuinely joyous like she was blissful in her situation despite having gotten to the point that she sometimes struggled to stand. The cuts and bruises still kept appearing on her skin only now it seemed a lot more like self-harm. The cuts would appear on her legs and arms, and the bruises were the same.

The night I realized that was the night I told myself I'd call the police in the morning and see if they could force her to get help. It was the only thing I could think to do. My worry for her well-being had gotten so bad that I had to hide the gun lockbox we had in the basement to avoid even the idea of her getting to it and doing something. I had come home from work that night and for some reason, I couldn’t find her in the house. The whole house was absolutely thrashed. Every cupboard in the kitchen was pulled out and tossed throughout the room. Every picture frame we had was broken.

For a moment, I thought someone had broken in and I ran looking for her. I looked everywhere, but then I found her in the bathroom, once again looking in the mirror standing in the dark. I slowly stepped towards her because every time I had found her in this state something was wrong. She was gripping the sink, her hands bleeding with broken glass in her knuckles from the frames that she had apparently smashed with her fists. She was wearing shorts and a tank top, her ribs and joints looked like they were wrapped tight in a thin layer of wax paper. She was twitching, whispering something to herself interlaced with giggling that ushered in a small twitch as she did. My foot entered the threshold of the bathroom, and as I inched towards her, I reached out my hand. But as I began to utter my first words, she gripped the sink tighter and used her grip to smash her head into the mirror. Splintering the reflective glass and spitting blood out along the wall.

“JESUS CHRIST ABBY WHAT ARE YOU DOING!” I shouted reflectively, before I could get the second half of that sentence out, she did it again and again. Before she could slam her head into the mirror the 4th time I rushed in and grabbed her the shoulders and pulled her away from the sink. I pulled her out of the bathroom and looked at her head. Shards of the mirror had been implanted into her forehead and cheeks. The blood from her head was trickling down her head and into her mouth where it grew into what I could say was the widest smile I'd ever seen on her face. Her eyes were filling with tears as she smiled and made a sound somewhere between laughing hysterically and sobbing. I didn’t want to yell at her after what she did, but I couldn’t control myself at that moment.

“What the hell is wrong with you Abby? God damnit! Look at what you did to yourself! Why the hell did you do this?” she just looked down at the ground. “I’m so Sorry… I just… feel so good… it feels so good! I’ve never felt this good before! I’m finally happy!” her hysterical laughter had toned down to muffled giggles as she stuck her hand over her mouth and cried seemingly tears of joy. I grabbed her by the hand and brought her downstairs, sitting her on the couch as I ran to the other room to use the landline and call for help.

“Stay here! I’m calling 911!”  I shouted as I went to get up, she grabbed at my shirt and pulled at me. “NO! No, please! Don’t call them! They’ll make it stop! You can’t! They’ll take It away! Please, please!”  she was totally hysterical. Her eyes were filled with a panic I hadn’t seen since we rushed to the hospital for her father. “Get off me!” I said prying her off and sitting her back down. I didn’t want to be like this with her, but she needed a kind of help that I just could give her, and I could do that without getting her out of her own way. “Sit down! You need help, Abby! This is for your own good!” I ran to the phone and dialed 911, quickly spitting out my address and what had happened. The operator told me help would be there in 8 minutes, but I quickly had to stop listening as I heard the sound of more glass breaking. I turned around and saw that Abby was gone from the couch.

I dropped the phone, letting it dangle off the cord, and walked to the kitchen. She was standing at the kitchen sink and drying rack. She picked up a plate and smashed it on the ground. Again. And again. Broken glass was littering the ground as it exploded across the floor in shards and ceramic dust. She was so close to the knives I didn’t want to try and push her any further, I needed to calm her down. “Abby? Abby just put down the plates ok honey? Why don’t we both just sit down and watch something? Ok? No one is gonna take anything away from you alright? Abby took the last plate in the rack and threw it on the ground. She turned to me, the sound of glass crunching under her bare feet. That’s when I saw it.

In the window above the sink, I could see her the reflection of the room against the night outside. In that reflection, I saw something I could only describe as otherworldly. There was something on Abby’s back, gripping onto her from her arms and legs. It was some sort of bug. It was huge, about the size of her ribcage. If I had to describe it now, it was something akin to a spider fused with a crab or something with a hard spikey shell and 8 limbs. Whatever it was, I couldn’t see it in person. Only in the reflection.

The spider lifted its leg that was grabbing Abby’s right hand and puppeteer-ed her down to the floor. As it did, she picked up a large broken shard of glass that split her palm as she gripped it tight. “I feel… so… good Trevor…” she said as she rose back up looking at me. In the reflection, the spider's 4 other limps reared up and over her head, wrapping themselves around her face. Two of the claws gripped the ends of her cheeks, the other two wrapped down over her head and gripped her eyelids. I shuttered as my eyes darted from the window to her face as I saw what happened. The spider began to pull back its limbs on her face and in person, the flesh on her cheeks and eyebrows began to slowly widen and stretch until they hit their limits… Then kept going, the flesh of her mouth and eyes being torn across by invisible hooks until her jaw and eyes were left bare and open.  

“I feel so good…” she said struggling to get the words out through her ruined flapping maw. “And you want to take that away from me…” she stepped forward, and I stepped back. There was the dining room table between the two of us, and all the kitchenware littered the floor. She picked up her leg and placed her shin on the corner of the table. I took another step back. We both moved so unbearably slowly but to me, it felt like the world was moving fast forward.

“I WON’T LET YOU TAKE AWAY MY HAPPYNESS!” she screeched the words as she used her hand and leg to push herself up and over the table. She slipped for a moment and launched herself over the table, tackling me down to the floor. I tried to move out of the way, but she moved so fast I couldn’t react fast enough. She was so light that a man of my size should have been able to pick her up and throw her, but wherever was puppeteering her was so strong I was stuck and pinned to the floor as my arms stopped hers from digging the shard of glass she had in her hands into my throat. She was screaming, screeching as she forced her hands down.

She rose up and brought her torso back down, the glass moved from my throat and to my face as my arms resisted her strength. The tip of the glass nearly pierced my eye as I looked at its jagged edge. I managed to move my head enough to let the glass only graze across my cheek. She rose herself and brought herself down once more only this time my arms had run out of strength to stop her from pressing herself into me and I could only move out of the way as the jagged edge gashed into my shoulder. I screamed as the plate wrenched down the muscle tearing its connections. I used my legs to kick her off of me, her back ramming into the corner edge of the table skidding it across the room. I rolled over to my good shoulder and pushed myself onto my feet.

I ran into the hall, hoping to get to the basement door and grab the gun that I was thankful I had hidden before. My only regret was that I had hidden it so far away. Abby pushed herself up and ran around the corner of the hall, slamming into the wall as the spider forced her body past its normal limits. Right before my hand could grab the door handle, I heard the quick pattering of her feet as she rushed in and dug the shard into my side. The wind in my chest left as I tried and failed to scream out in pain. Reflectively I whipped around and backhanded her, her exposed molars gashing into the back of my hand as she collapsed onto the ground. I retched open the door but before I could go inside and close it, she threw herself across the floor and cut at my ankle. I felt the tendon snap in half as the glass cut across my achilleas forcing me to tumble down the stairs.

As my head hit the cold hard ground of the dark basement floor I looked up and saw her twitching silhouette at the top of the stairs slowly descending one step at a time. Dizzy and bleeding I dragged myself across the floor, watching her body shake with anticipation as her bleeding feet touched down on the cold concrete. In the back of the basement, I got to the workbench where I had hidden the old revolver, I had hidden earlier that week.

“I’m happy…. Happy… I won’t let you… I WON’T!” before she could drop down and finish me off, I grabbed the gun from the box. Two shots rang out as her chest then her head snapped back, spinning her around and dropping her to the floor. I used my good arm and good leg to pull myself up the bench and leaned against it. Tears began to well up in me. Not because I was hurt, but because I just had to kill the love of my life. I didn’t know what to do, it was all I could think to do. I didn’t want this to be how it ended. I closed my eyes and wept. Screaming into the suddenly empty nothingness of the house.

I heard a shuffling that shook me out of my sorrow, and my cloudy teary eyes fell on her corpse. I knew it was a corps because I shot her in the head, yet her limp arm pushed herself up. By the time I realized what was going on her corpse was now standing, facing me. Her arm suddenly reached up, around, and broke backward, as every limb she had quickly did the same. Her body rushed me grabbing at my arms and all of her limbs attacked me while her torso faced in the opposite direction, trying to rip the gun from my hands. Her head finally turned towards me, her neck making a loud wet popping sound as her face now faced mine. The bullet hole sat in her cheek and her whole face sagged blank and empty.

She slammed me into the bench once, twice, the second time digging the table's edge into my stabbed side. I used every last inch of strength I had to pull my raised arms down with the gun in between the two of us. She was struggling to keep the pistol out of line as I pulled it between my chest and her back and finally pulled the trigger, unloading the last 4 shots. Her limp and broken body fell against mine and I pushed her off of me and back on the ground. Now exhausted of strength I fell to my knees.

I realized that whoever was controlling her before was still alive and used her body to attack me until the very end. I needed to kill it, to finish that fight. As I looked at her corpse, the spider now sat visibly on her back. It’s black, with a wispy black fog bellowing off its core and between its joints. It had long, thin, and spindly limbs that seemed to be gripping onto Abby’s wrists and ankles using sharp jagged hook-like claws. Its head had 10 shiny wet eyes and a set of pincers that were dug into the base of Abby’s neck, and something between those pincers led up nape. I crawled over to it… to her, to get a closer look. There was something akin to a needle or a tube leading into her neck from the creature’s mouth. I looked over, and the floor was pooling with her blood. Only the blood was broken up by some clear yellowish liquid like water on oil. All of it was spilling out of the hole in her neck and skull, and the monster’s mouth.

Suddenly and with no warning, her whole body shuddered, and I shot myself backward, crawling back against the wall. Her body, or rather, the body of the monster still gripping onto her limbs began to bend and withdraw like a dead tarantula, breaking and snapping every bone in her body as it twisted and contorted backward into a ball. I hear sirens begin to round my street through the small window of my basement. I looked through the foggy web-laced glass and saw the flashing red and blue lights of the police. I was thankful that help was finally coming. I could feel myself slipping away into unconsciousness as the blood from my wounds filled the floor. But as I began to black out, in my last seconds of consciousness, I heard a hissing sound coming from her body. When I finally looked over, the body of the spider was gone.

When I finally came to, I was in the hospital with handcuffs sticking me to the bed. The police had come a few hours later, questioning me about what happened at my residence before ultimately announcing to me that I was under arrest for the murder of Abigail Michaels. I tried to convince them it was self-defense, I really did. But a 190-pound man with a background in the military doesn’t look good when his wife turns up with 6 bullet holes and every bone in her body snapped in 3 by twisting. I’ll never be able to get the image of her broken body out of my head, And I’m going to be sitting in a prison cell for the rest of my life with it. That brings us to today. My court hearing ended yesterday, and the decision of the jury is announced tomorrow.

I don’t see myself being announced innocent, but whatever happens, this needs to be known now. I didn’t kill my wife. That thing did. Whatever it was it was making her sick, twisted. And whatever it was came from the lake Mooreshore woods. I’m sure of it. Don’t go into the Lake Mooreshore woods unless you’re going to find whatever the hell this thing is. And if you do find it, don’t let it break you the same way it broke my wife.
