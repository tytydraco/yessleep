The needle went in with a sound like tearing paper. That was the first thing I noticed how the puncture of skin could sound like something so mundane. Then the cold spread up my arm, the world tilting sideways as the orderlies' hands clamped tighter around my biceps.

“Subject displays paranoid ideation and hysterical resistance,” someone noted from beyond the halo of the overhead light. The voice scratched against my ears like wool on sunburn.

I tried to tell them about the letter. About how my landlady had forged the signature after I complained about the rats in the walls. But my tongue was already slurring against my teeth, heavy as a slab of meat.

The last clear thing I saw was the iron gate swinging shut behind us, its wrought-iron scrollwork spelling out HIGH ROYDS in letters that looked like they'd been hammered out of old surgical tools. Then the blackness swallowed me whole.

When I woke, the smell hit first ammonia undercut with something sweetly rotten, like fruit left to ferment in a bandage bin. My cheek stuck to the cold tile floor. Across the room, a porcelain sink dripped steadily into a rust-stained basin. The walls were padded, but not with the clean white quilting you see in films. These were stained yellow-brown at chest height, the horsehair stuffing bursting through splits in the leather like infected wounds.

I'd read about High Royds in the papers. The “model asylum,” they called it, with its cricket pitch and operating theaters lit by skylights. No one mentioned how the Victorian brickwork swallowed sound whole, or how the central heating pipes knocked all night like a man begging to be let out of the walls.

A key turned in the lock.

“You're awake.” The nurse filled the doorway, her starched cap casting a shadow like a guillotine blade. “Dr. Vaillant wants you prepped for hydrotherapy by half-ten.”

I opened my mouth to protest, but she was already uncapping a syringe. That's when I noticed the restraints on the gurney thick leather straps with buckles worn shiny from use.

The hydrotherapy room smelled of wet wool and chlorine. They'd strapped me into the canvas harness like a side of beef, my toes just brushing the porcelain tub's rim. 

“Temperature at forty-five Fahrenheit,” murmured an orderly, adjusting the brass dials on the wall. Condensation wept down the tiles. “Duration twenty minutes.” 

Dr. Vaillant's pocket watch swung above my face, its chain reflecting the single bulb overhead. “You'll thank us for this clarity,” he said, and nodded to the attendant. 

The water hit like a thousand needles. My scream came out silent the cold had stolen my breath. Muscles locked rigid, I watched my own fingers turn blue as the harness creaked. Somewhere beyond the ringing in my ears, a gramophone played Chopin. 

That's when I understood High Royds' true horror: the precision. The way they timed screams to the waltz from the staff room. How the shock treatments synchronized with the factory whistle from the nearby mill. Every cruelty had paperwork. 

Three weeks in, I learned to chew the soap to fake foam during inspections. The orderlies preferred patients who looked properly broken. By month two, I could map the steam tunnels by the taste of the aircoal dust meant the boiler room, carbolic acid led to surgery. 

The night I found Sister Mortimer's ledger in the linen closet, everything changed. Her neat cursive documented which patients got extra sedatives before the medical board visits. Which ones “fell” down stairs after witnessing things in the electroconvulsive therapy suite. 

I pressed the stolen pages to my chest as footsteps echoed in the corridor. The ink smudged against my sweat names, dates, doses. Proof. 

Somewhere beyond the barred windows, an owl called. Or maybe it was the sound the pipes made when someone was screaming in the basement. After enough time here, you stop knowing the difference. 

The day the music stopped was the day I realized they'd been drugging us with the hymns. Every morning at 6:03 sharp, the tinny speaker system would crackle to life with “Abide With Me.” By the third verse, your tongue would go numb around the edges just enough to make the porridge taste like wet newspaper. I only noticed when the record skipped during a power cut, and Sister Briggs' hands shook too much to restart it.

“Subject 742 appears agitated,” Dr. Vaillant noted that afternoon, his pen scraping against the clipboard. The nib caught on the paper with a sound like tearing skin. “Administer paraldehyde at 5mg/kg and prepare for ocular examination.”

They'd refined the process since the war. No more crude ice picks through the eye socket now they used a modified cataract needle, inserted through the tear duct while you stared at a photograph of the King. I'd seen the tools being sterilized in the autoclave, their chrome gleaming under the skylight where pigeons sometimes got trapped and died.

That night in the dormitory, I pressed my forehead against the cold pipes and listened. The steam whispered names: Martha Green, lobotomized after complaining about maggots in her bread. Thomas Pike, drowned in the hydrotherapy tub when no one checked the restraints. Alice... something. Her record ended mid-sentence.

The mattress straw crunched as I turned. Three cots down, a new patient rocked silently, her fingers picking at the stitches across her scalp. Moonlight through the barred windows striped her face like a prison uniform.

“You're still whole,” she whispered suddenly. Her pupils were pinpricks. “They haven't taken the angry bits yet.”

The air tasted of iodine and something sweetly metallic. Down the hall, a cart rattled toward us the midnight medication round. I watched her mouth the Lord's Prayer backward as the footsteps grew closer, her lips moving around words that weren't quite English.

When the door creaked open, the syringe in Nurse Briggs' hand caught the light. The liquid inside was the color of a bruise.

The ocular examination began with a drop of cocaine solution “to dull the surface,” Vaillant explained, though I knew it was really so we wouldn't flinch when the needle went in. The King's portrait stared up from the examination table, his face yellowed at the edges where patients had scratched at the laminate with their fingernails.

“Keep your eyes on His Majesty,” ordered the orderly, his forearm pressing down on my trachea just enough to make breathing require conscious effort. The needle caught the light a silver filament thinner than a hair. When it entered my tear duct, there was a sound like celery snapping.

That's when the screaming started. Mine or someone else's, I couldn't tell anymore. The needle kept advancing, millimeter by millimeter, until I tasted copper and realized I'd bitten through my own tongue.

Recovery meant lying still in the dark ward while the other patients moaned. Blood crusted my left eyelid shut. Through the right, I watched dust motes swirl in the shaft of light from the skylight the same skylight where I'd seen the maintenance man retrieve a dead pigeon last Tuesday with hooked poles normally used for retrieving golf balls.

At midnight, when the morphine wore off enough for me to stand, I tested the theory. The autoclave room door squealed like a stuck pig when I forced it, but the night nurse was too busy sedating the chronic screamers in Ward C to notice.

The coal chute was exactly where the pipe whispers said it would be a square of darkness behind the incinerator, its cast-iron door left ajar since the tuberculosis ward's closure. The smell hit first: damp mortar and something sweetly rotten, like the time I'd found a fox carcass in the cricket pavilion.

Hand over hand, I lowered myself into the blackness. Somewhere below, water dripped with the regularity of a metronome. The last thing I saw before the darkness swallowed me whole was Vaillant's pocket watch, discarded on the laundry cart its crystal face cracked like a frozen pond, the hands forever stuck at 2:37.

Modern psych wards don't use coal chutes anymore.

That's what the nurse tells me as she adjusts my restraints, her ID badge identifying her as “Mortimer.” The fluorescent lights hum a familiar tune something between a hymn and a factory whistle. Outside my window, a cricket pitch stretches toward a red-brick building with barred windows.

When I scream about the needle, she sighs and uncaps a syringe. The liquid inside is the color of a bruise.

“You'll thank us for this clarity,” she says.

And as the cold spreads up my arm, I realize with perfect, horrifying certainty that I always do. 

The needle went in with the same tearing-paper sound as before. Only this time, I didn't fight it. The cold crept up my arm like an old friend as Mortimer's face blurred above me her starched cap merging with the fluorescent lights into a halo of sterile white.

Somewhere beyond the hiss of the HVAC vents, a cricket bat made contact with a ball. The sound echoed through the years, bouncing between 1955 and whatever year this was supposed to be. The drug dragged me under just as the intercom crackled to life with the opening notes of “Abide With Me.”

I wake to birdsong. Real birds this time, not the pipe-owls of High Royds. Sunlight cuts through barred windows—different bars though, powder-coated steel instead of wrought iron. The chart at the foot of my bed says “ECT completed 14:30” in handwriting suspiciously like Vaillant's.

“Feeling clearer?” Mortimer adjusts the IV with practiced hands. The syringe in her pocket catches the light.

I open my mouth to describe the coal chute, the autoclave room, the ocular needle glinting like a silver hair. What comes out is: “Yes, sister. Thank you.”

Her smile doesn't reach her eyes. They're the color of the liquid now dripping into my vein that same bruise-purple I last saw swirling down High Royds' drain after hydrotherapy.

When she turns to leave, I count her footsteps. Twelve to the door. Always twelve.

The thought dissolves before it forms. Outside, a lawnmower whirs across the cricket pitch. The smell of cut grass mixes with antiseptic. Somewhere beneath it all lingers that sweet-rotten odor, faint as a half-remembered nightmare.

I close my eyes. The pillowcase feels like starched cotton. The mattress like horsehair. The restraint around my left wrist.

“Subject appears calm,” says a voice from the doorway. The clipboard scratches. “Prepare for discharge.”

The door clicks shut. In the silence, the radiator knocks twice.

I smile against the straps.

Knock back.
