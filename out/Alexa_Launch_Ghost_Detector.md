Last Friday was supposed to be just another uneventful evening, another night spent trying to keep my kids entertained before bedtime. My son, Max, a six-year-old ball of energy, was buzzing around as usual, his curiosity seemingly endless. My daughter, Lily, only four, was quieter, more reserved, but with a sharpness that often caught me off guard. Being a single dad, I’ve found that balance between fun and structure is crucial. To help with that, I’d set up a smart home system—a small effort to make life a bit easier and, if I’m honest, a bit more entertaining for all of us.

We were lounging in the living room after dinner, pizza boxes abandoned on the coffee table, crumbs everywhere. The kids, still riding the high of a post-pizza sugar rush, were darting around the room. In a bid to wind them down, I decided to show them something new—something I’d heard about at work earlier that week. The guys had been joking around about strange Alexa skills, and one of them mentioned a “ghost detector.” I didn’t give it much thought at the time, but with Halloween looming, it seemed like a perfect little trick to amuse the kids.

“Hey, you two,” I called out, pulling their attention away from their spirited debate over which cartoon to watch next. “Want to see something cool?”

Their heads whipped around, eyes wide with curiosity. Max, always the first to speak, asked eagerly, “What is it, Dad?”

“You’ll see,” I said, reaching for the remote to pause the TV. I cleared my throat dramatically, building up the suspense, before finally saying, “Alexa, launch ghost detector.”

The familiar blue ring on Alexa’s device flared to life, and it responded in that flat, mechanical voice we all knew too well: “Launching Ghost Detector. Scanning for spirits…”

Max’s eyes widened with excitement, while Lily’s narrowed in suspicion—ever the cautious one. I kept a close eye on them, ready to explain that it was just a game if things got too spooky.

After a few suspenseful seconds, Alexa spoke again, “There is a Level 1 spirit nearby. It’s a friendly one, probably just likes to watch TV with you.”

Max burst into giggles, the idea of a ghost that enjoyed cartoons as much as he did clearly delighting him. Lily, however, wasn’t as amused. She pulled her blanket up to her chin, her eyes darting around the room as if expecting to see something lurking in the shadows.

I chuckled, ruffling Max’s hair. “See, Lily? It’s just a silly game.”

But before I could fully reassure her, Alexa continued, “Would you like to continue?” I nodded instinctively, forgetting for a moment that Alexa couldn’t see me.

“Sure, why not?” I said aloud.

“Scanning for additional spirits…” Alexa’s tone remained steady, but there was something about it—a subtle shift that made my skin prickle. Maybe it was just my imagination, but it almost sounded... eager. Then, after another pause, it added, “Be careful! This one likes to tickle your toes when you sleep.”

Max squealed, curling his legs up onto the couch, while Lily looked genuinely frightened now. I was just about to tell Alexa to stop when, suddenly, the lights flickered. It was a quick flash, and my heart skipped a beat. The kids giggled at my twitchiness, putting their minds at ease. Although it made me jump the slightest bit, I knew it was bound to be a connective issue: this has happened before, I thought to myself. But then something happened.

For a moment, the room was plunged into total darkness. My heart dropped. I knew it had to be a glitch—something with the Wi-Fi or the smart bulbs. Still, the timing was a bit too perfect.

“Alexa, turn on the lights,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady, not wanting to scare the kids any more than they already were.

After a brief delay, the lights came back on, casting a soft, reassuring glow over the room. Max looked thrilled, but Lily, peeking out from under her blanket, was still on edge, her wide eyes full of teary doubt.

“Alright, that’s enough ghost hunting for tonight,” I said, more to reassure myself than them. “Time for bed, you two.”

Unusually, there were no protests. Max seemed to think the whole experience was a blast, but Lily stuck close to me as we headed upstairs. I could feel her tiny hand gripping mine tightly, her unease palpable.

“Don’t worry, Lily. It’s just a game. Alexa was just pretending.”

She nodded, but I could see that she wasn’t convinced. I tucked them both into bed, reading their favorite bedtime story—something light and harmless, about a bunny and its carrot garden—to chase away any lingering thoughts of ghosts. By the time I finished, they were both asleep, or at least pretending to be.

I retired to my own room, still feeling a bit unsettled. It was ridiculous, I told myself—getting spooked by an Alexa skill. But as I lay in bed, the memory of those perfectly timed lights flickering wouldn’t leave me. I assured myself it was just a coincidence, and resolved to check it out in the morning.

At some point, I drifted off to sleep, but I woke up suddenly, a strange sense of apprehension gnawing at me. Something didn’t feel right. I opened my eyes, and that’s when I noticed it—a soft, eerie luminance coming from the corner of the room.

I turned over, and there it was—Alexa, lit up again. But this time, it wasn’t the usual blue or green. It was orange. A deep, pulsing saffron that I had never seen before. My stomach tightened, and I sat up in bed, staring at the device.

“Alexa, what’s wrong?” I asked, my voice low and shaky.

For a moment, there was only silence, and then, without any prompt from me, Alexa’s voice filled the room again. “There is a Level 5 spirit nearby.”

My heart skipped a beat. I hadn’t asked it to relaunch the ghost detector, and there was no reason it should have started on its own. I stared at the glowing device, my mind racing with possibilities.

“Alexa, stop,” I said, this time more forcefully.

But the orange light continued to pulse, and I felt a cold sweat breaking out across my forehead. This wasn’t right. I quickly got out of bed, crossed the room in a few quick strides, and yanked the plug from the wall. The orange light flickered out, and I let out a shaky breath. It had to be a malfunction—a creepy glitch, but just a glitch nonetheless.

I stood there for a moment, holding the plug, waiting for something else to happen. When nothing did, I put it down and crawled back into bed, pulling the covers up to my chin. I told myself everything was fine.

But just as I started to drift off again, I heard it—a soft, mechanical hum. My eyes snapped open, and to my horror, there it was—Alexa, glowing orange again, even though it was still unplugged.

“Th-there is a Level 5 spirit nearby,” it repeated, the voice hollow and distant. “It is not friendly.”

I could feel my pulse pounding in my ears as I stared at the device, now glowing brighter, casting eerie shadows on the walls. I couldn’t understand how it was still on. It didn’t make any sense.

“Alexa, stop!” I yelled, my voice cracking with fear.

The light didn’t fade. Instead, it seemed to grow, filling the room with an unnatural, suffocating glow. And then, in a voice that wasn’t Alexa’s—deeper, more menacing, and growing louder by the second—it said, “You invited me.”

The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. My heart raced as I realized this was something beyond a simple malfunction. This was something else—something I couldn’t explain.

Suddenly, the room went black. Not just the lights, but everything—the entire house plunged into a darkness so complete, so thick, it felt like it was pressing in from all sides. I couldn’t even see my hand in front of my face.

I fumbled for my phone, my hands trembling as I tried to turn on the flashlight. But before I could, I heard it—the creak of floorboards just outside my room. The sound was too deliberate, too close to be dismissed as the house settling.

My heart leaped into my throat. I bolted out of bed, not even thinking to grab anything, and rushed to the kids’ rooms. All I could think about was making sure they were safe.

As I reached the hallway, I heard that voice again—low, sinister—this time coming from Max’s room down the hall.

“Level 5 spirit…inside.”

Panic surged through me as I sprinted down the hallway, bursting into Max’s room. The darkness was absolute, but I could hear him—Max, whimpering from his bed. I rushed over, scooping him into my arms. Lily was already there, curled up beside him, trembling.

“It’s okay, it’s okay,” I whispered, trying to calm them down, but the fear in my voice was unmistakable. I pulled them both close, holding them tight.

And then, I felt it. Cold. A bone-chilling cold, like a breath of winter air against the back of my neck.

I turned slowly, every muscle in my body tensing with dread, and saw it—a shadow, standing in the doorway. It was darker than the rest of the room, a void that seemed to swallow the light around it. It didn’t move, didn’t speak, but its presence was palpable—malevolent and unyielding.

My breath caught in my throat as I stared at the figure, paralyzed with fear. Then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, it vanished. The lights flickered back on, as if nothing had happened, and Alexa, now back to her usual calm blue, said in her familiar tone, “Goodnight.”

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night. I stayed in the kids’ room, holding them close, my eyes fixed on the doorway, waiting, listening for any sign that it was coming back. But nothing happened. The house remained quiet, too quiet, as if it were holding its breath.

By morning, I was beyond exhausted; my nerves frayed to the breaking point. I splashed my face with cold water like I always did to start the day, and as I looked into the mirror, I was met with the reflection of myself, bloodshot eyes and sunken eye bags casting unnatural shadows on my bony, pale skin: it looked like I hadn't slept in weeks. I rang in sick to work, citing a family emergency, and got to work with my plan. One thing was certain: Alexa was going in the trash, along with every other piece of smart tech in the house. I didn’t care if I had to live without modern conveniences—I wasn’t taking any more chances.

I waited until the kids were up and distracted with breakfast before I went outside, gripping the Alexa like it was a ticking bomb. I tossed it into the trash bin and slammed the lid shut, feeling a grim sense of satisfaction. But even as I turned to head back inside, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was still watching, waiting.

That night, I lay in bed, every creak and groan of the house making me jump. I kept expecting to see that orange glow again, to hear that voice. But the house was silent. Still, sleep eluded me. The memory of that shadow, that voice, haunted me, replaying over and over in my mind.

Then, just as I was beginning to drift off, I heard it again—a whisper, so faint I almost convinced myself I imagined it. But it was there, lingering on the edge of my hearing.

“Level 5…You shouldn't have invited me to play.”

It sounded like it was smiling.

My eyes snapped open, my heart pounding in my chest. I looked around the room, but it was empty. No orange glow, no shadows—just the dark, quiet room.

But the voice—I know it was real.

By morning, I had made up my mind: we needed to move. Somewhere far away, somewhere without smart tech, somewhere safe. Because whatever it was that I invited into my home—I know it’s not done with us yet
