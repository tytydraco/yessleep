**Day 5**

I had spent most of the night before crying and confused. I texted a few people that I thought were my friends and most either ignored me or had blocked me completely. Only one replied. To put it briefly, there was a rumour going around that I had done something highly inappropriate with the food I had prepared for one of my previous clients' children. There was also a photo circulating of me wearing nothing but an apron while I worked a barbeque in a small garden.

Needless to say, the rumours are completely false. The picture, while genuine, is one that was taken while I was in the army. I was at a garden party with a few of my squad mates and things got a little silly. You know how it is. For some reason, the picture is being circulated along with the rumour, and apparently, most people are simply accepting it as a fact. To make matters worse, the family I have apparently committed this crime against have moved away, so I have no way of defending myself or rebutting the claims.

It seemed that whoever was spreading these lies was either trying to get me killed, arrested, or thrown out of town. No one would hire me. No one wanted to even speak to me. Frankly, I was lucky that not everyone was adept at social media, and was still able to buy my food and household supplies from people that the rumour hadn't quite reached. I couldn't afford to leave town just yet, and there was nowhere for me to turn.

I had only one choice.

I returned to the Ismay house as requested, and was met with Elizabeth at the doorway. She did not smile, but welcomed me into the house nonetheless, closing the door behind me.

**Days 6-14**

As I had in the days previous, I prepared, cooked and served Professor Ismay's bowls of meat three times a day. Elizabeth never mentioned the rumour about me, nor did she seem to care if she knew. Agnes never said anything about it either. She was always nearby it seemed, always watching and listening. I could never tell if she was there to watch over me or spy on me for Elizabeth. The camera in the kitchen would follow me as I moved around, when I was filling the Professor's bowl or scrubbing the pots and pans afterwards. Its gaze was fixed.

The Professor seemed to walk around his room less and less as the days went on. Sometimes when I would deliver the trolley, he wouldn't move at all, and on a few occasions, I would retrieve the trolley with the bowl either untouched or only partially disturbed. Elizabeth told me to simply toss the scraps into the lake for the wildlife. The fish and the freshwater eels never left any scraps.

On the third Monday, everything changed.

**Day 15**

That morning as I was walking towards the house, I noticed that one of the windows in the Professor's room was cracked. The glass was still in the frame, but there was a circular break in the pane as though it had been struck by a rock or a ball, somewhere in the middle. What surprised me, however, was that the glass was broken outward, meaning that the impact had come from the inside.

When I asked Agnes what had happened, she simply shook her head and said she didn't know.

I didn't believe her.

I didn't see Elizabeth the whole morning, and began my duties as I had done every day for the previous two weeks. The first meal was especially sordid. Chicken livers, fresh crab, pheasant, pork tongue and black pudding. The crabs were to be served in their shells.

I lubricated the hinges to the Professor's door and unbolted it, and then paused for a second to listen for any movement. I couldn't hear anything, so I pushed open the door. As it swung into the room, I heard the loud clicking sound that he had been making more and more. It was slightly different this time though. It was a little higher pitch, and a little quicker. I peered into the room, scanning for any sign of the Professor. There was no movement that I could see, so I wheeled the trolley inside.

I decided to take a moment before I rang the bell. I thought I might steal another look at him. I hadn't alerted him yet. At least, I didn't think so anyway. If I needed to, I could get out before he was off the bed. He was old after all and I was pretty fit. I glanced around, squinting in the darkness, trying to make sense of any shape that might be there. I couldn't see much. After an uncomfortable thirty seconds or so, I rang the bell, and then slowly backed out of the room, still glancing around for any sign that he was there. I closed the door, bolted it and listened.

Absolute silence.

I waited for a minute or so, listening with my ear pressed against the door. I couldn't hear anything at all. I figured that he was probably asleep. Before long, I gave up waiting and set off down the stairs. When I was about halfway down, I heard the loudest crash I'd ever heard up until that point come from inside his room. I fell against the bannister in shock, expecting the wall to have come down behind me. Agnes came trotting as fast as she could from the front sitting room, and she looked on in disgust as we heard the terrible animalistic feeding of the Professor upstairs.

I'd bumped my head a little when I fell against the bannister, and when I rubbed it my hand was wet. At first I thought it was blood, but it wasn't. A shiver ran down my spine. It was a semi-transparent white mucus.

He had been above me in that room, he must have. A few feet? or a few inches? I wasn't sure, but he'd been there. Right above my head.

"Are you alright?" Agnes asked.

I don't remember what I'd said to her. I was in shock. I stumbled into the kitchen and washed my hair in the sink. The mucus was revolting. It stunk like you wouldn't believe, and it was difficult to remove. It clung to me like glue.

An hour passed, and then another. I sat in the kitchen scrubbing the pans slowly, prolonging the inevitable. The camera never left me, and eventually, Agnes came into the kitchen.

"It's time, my love." she said softly.

"What is wrong with Professor Ismay, Agnes?" I asked.

"He is... unwell."

"Tell me the truth."

She looked uncomfortable. She interlocked her fingers and I could see her lip wavering.

"I don't know." she said softly.

As I finished washing the knife I'd used to cut the chicken livers, I wrapped it in a dish cloth to dry it and slipped it into my apron as stealthily as I could manage. I don't think Agnes noticed, although I was unsure about the camera. I didn't care though. I wasn't going back into that room without it.

Agnes followed me up the stairs and stood with me as I lubricated the hinges of the door. I unbolted it, and allowed it to swing open. I felt my heart sink. For the first time, the trolley was not where I had left it. It was further into the room, and it was lying on its side. The bowl was nowhere to be seen.

"What do I do now?" I whispered.

"Your job, my love." Agnes whispered back.

In any other circumstance, I might have taken her reply as a snarky remark, or an attempt to belittle me with sarcasm. But there was a sadness in her voice and her eyes, and I knew that she was not telling me what to do, but asking me to help with what she could not. The faint hush of rain on the manor house's many rooves began above us, like ever-present TV static in the air. I could hear it on the windows as I stepped inside.

The first thing I did was check above the door. I heard Agnes stifle a whimper as I looked, and at that moment I'd like to think that we both understood not only the gravity of the situation, but that we were on the same page regarding the Professor's condition.

Professor Ismay didn't seem to be there, nor was he on his bed when I looked. There was a foul stench emanating from the back corners of the room as I stepped further and further in. It was sour in the air and struck the back of my throat like hot needles. I glanced behind, there was about twenty feet of open space behind me at this point. I'd never been this far in before. The carpet beneath my feet was wet and sticky, and every footstep felt as though I was walking on a thick layer of mud.

I reached the trolley and knelt down to grab it. As quietly as I could manage, I stood it upright and gave it a slight pull. It moved well enough, the wheels weren't damaged or seized in any way, but there was no sign of the bowl. As I started to walk backwards I heard the clicking of the Professor from somewhere beside me.

From behind the curtains to my right, a huge black shape lunged at me, clicking and trilling as though in ecstasy at the success of its trap.

I could only scream.

I fell backwards as the slimy filth-ridden body of the professor slammed into me. He was groaning and screeching, producing sounds that humans simply should not be able to make. The curtain that had hidden him was now on the floor, the rod having been pulled from the wall. In what little light that broke through the grime-covered windows, I could see that the professor's skin was black all over. The texture of which was now more crocodilian than toad, but still coated in that same mucus-like slime I had seen last time I had caught a glimpse of him.

I screamed and tried to claw away, but he was monstrously strong and held me in place. His nails dug into my skin as he lunged for my neck. In the scuffle, I saw his face. It was contorted and stretched, as though his skull was too large for the skin attached to it. His eyes were swollen and dead-looking, surrounded almost entirely by smaller black orbs that covered the entire top half of his head. His mouth was contorted into a sort of tube-like shape, with his teeth on the outside, circling the proboscis that was once his lower jaw.

I tried to grab his hands to pull him off, but they were so wet and slimy that I couldn't get a grip on them. His elongated mouth snapped at my face and neck, finding my ear as I turned away. His teeth clamped down as I screamed in pain. Suddenly I remembered the knife. I could hear Agnes crying and screaming as I pulled it from my apron and jammed it into the Professor's shoulder. He let out a shrill cry and for a moment his grip loosened. I managed to pull away and clamber to my feet.

I ran for the door and dived onto the floor at Agnes' feet. I caught one last glimpse of the Professor before Agnes locked him inside his room. He was at least seven feet tall, and there was some sort of gigantic growth on his back, almost as though he wore a backpack beneath his skin. The malformed Professor shrieked banshee-like as Agnes slammed the door, drove the bolts home and immediately started wailing.

Blood ran down my neck. It didn't hurt too bad after the initial bite, at least not right away. I remember being so full of adrenaline that I could barely stand or form words. Inside, the Professor, or whatever he now was, was screeching and screaming and clawing at the door like an enraged animal robbed of its quarry. Agnes held the door handle and kept repeating the same thing, over and over:

"No more... no more... please God no more..."

"I'm gonna... I'm... I need an ambulance." I remember saying.

I could hardly speak. When I stood, my legs were like jelly. I left Agnes crying by the door and stumbled down the stairs as fast as I could. I felt faint, and very, very sick.

Through a crack in the doorway to the front sitting room, I noticed a mobile phone on the arm of a chair by the window. I made my way to it, and as I picked it up, I began to feel weak in my knees. I could hear banging upstairs. Agnes' horrid lamentations and banging that wouldn't cease. I swiped to unlock the phone. It was Elizabeth's. I hadn't seen her at all that day, but her phone was right there.

I tried calling the police, but when it connected I couldn't formulate my sentences properly. I was feeling dizzy and I'm sure I was slurring when I spoke. I remember calling two or three times, but either they kept hanging up, or I did. I don't really remember. I can only assume that I must have been completely unintelligible on the other end.

There was more banging. Louder and louder. Agnes began calling my name.

"John! John!" she cried, "John I can't-"

In all the commotion I somehow noticed that Elizabeth only had four apps on her home screen. Contacts, Messages, Calls, and Gallery. I don't know why, but I clicked on the Gallery app. In the screenshots section, I noticed a familiar photo. It was me. Me at the barbeque.

There was a loud crash upstairs.

Agnes screamed gutturally.

"John! He's... he's-"

I fell between the chair and the wall and passed out.

**Day 16**

When I woke up, it was dark. Very dark. There were a few lamps on in the room, but somehow there was an overwhelming blackness that seemed to surround me, ignoring all light. I was lying behind the chair where I'd fallen, Elizabeth's phone still in my hand. I checked the time and it said 03:49. I panicked and tried to stand. My back and my arm were killing me, and my head was still a little swimmy from the fall. The house was quiet. There was no sound whatsoever, except for the rain that ceaselessly beat at the windows.

I wasn't thinking clearly, I was confused and scared. I hadn't really processed what had happened earlier. I'm not sure I ever will. I stepped out into the foyer rubbing my head and glanced up the stairs. I couldn't see anything, or hear any noise, but I could feel that the Professor was up there. Up there somewhere in his room skulking about in his filth in the dark.

"Agnes?" I whispered.

Nothing.

"Elizabeth?"

Still nothing.

I headed towards the kitchen. The light was still on from earlier, and somehow that made me feel more safe. Every child knows that monsters can't get them if they have a night light. I guess that feeling never truly leaves us. I kept thinking that I might hear footsteps or see Agnes appear from around some corner at any moment, but there was nothing. I don't think I've ever felt more alone than I did at that moment.

I headed into the kitchen and turned on the tap for the sink. I let the water run through my fingers and washed my hands. I cupped two handfuls and passed them over my head, then took a few handfuls to drink. I needed to get out of the house while I still could. To hell with the money. To hell with all of it. I looked up at the camera and to my surprise it was active, but it wasn't looking at me.

It was looking at the fridges behind me.

When I looked at where the camera was pointing, I'm not ashamed to admit that I lost control of myself. I could feel my leg becoming warm as I noticed the great wet streaks across the door of the fridge, and the clumps of mucus that rolled slowly down the handle of the door.

Surprisingly, my first thought wasn't to run. Though it certainly should have been. I thought about Agnes. I needed to know if she was alright. She had pulled me to safety once before, I couldn't leave without at least looking for her. I took two knives from a large block near the sink. I placed one in the front pouch of my apron and held the other out in front of me.

I peered through the doorway of the kitchen into the foyer. The Professor wasn't there, not from what I could see anyway. I entered slowly, making sure to keep looking up and around, checking the corners and the ceiling. The wind and rain outside were thrashing violently. Somewhere far away I heard the low rumble of thunder.

I began up the stairs, taking one step at a time. Slowly. Slowly into the ever darker stairwell. The light at the top of the stairs was out. Whether it was broken or turned off, I could not tell. I could smell the Professor's room from halfway up. As his doorway came into view, I could see that it was flung wide open. The door itself was intact, mostly... but the bolts were ripped clean off. As I reached the top of the stairs I peered round the corner and down the hallway towards the other rooms of the first floor.

I couldn't see anything.

I couldn't hear anything.

Beside me on the floor, there was a dark shape. I watched it for a moment, my heart beating wildly. It didn't seem to be moving. I'd stood outside this door several times over the last two weeks, and I was sure there was a light switch somewhere nearby. I felt for it along the wall, keeping my knife hand ready just in case. After a while, my fingers found something hard. I pushed down, and a soft amber glow lit up the hallway.

I had to stifle my scream.

Agnes' body lay at my feet. Her face was battered and bloody, and the underside of her forearms were torn to shreds. Whatever the Professor did to her... he had mangled her badly. I remembered her voice calling my name before I passed out, and tears began to fill my eyes.

That's when I heard the clicking again.

It was behind me. Somewhere down the stairs. I turned to look, and sure enough, the Professor was in the foyer. He was staring at his own portrait on the wall with an animalistic curiosity. He hadn't seen me yet, so I moved as quickly and as quietly as I could around the corner at the top of the stairs. I couldn't help but watch him. His grotesque inhuman form staring at the visage of what he once was, never to be again. His proboscis made little clicking sounds as his lips and teeth rattled together, as though he was speaking to himself in a language that only he could understand.

He still carried the knife in his shoulder where I had stabbed him, but the large growth on his back was gone. Where it once had been, there were four spindly appendages sprouting from the centre of his back. They looked as though they had... unfurled, let's say. They were wet and dripping with mucus, twitching and drooping like vines from a great rotten willow. From below his left arm, there came yet another arm, protruding from the ribs. It had at some point burst through his skin and was curled up in front of his body, much in the way a dinosaur's arm would be.

His skin was a black mess of growths and boils, scale-like and stretched beyond measure. There was no other way to describe it. It looked to be pulled taught over his enormous inhuman figure, and when he moved it would tear and rip.

I didn't know what to do. I couldn't get by him, and I couldn't stay put either. I looked on in horror as he pressed his hands to the wall and suddenly began to walk up it with ease. At that moment, I did the only thing I could think to do. I stepped back into his room, and slowly closed the door.

I didn't think he'd seen me. It was a wonder he hadn't found me when I was downstairs. I reached around on the wall for a light switch and found one fairly quickly. I pressed it and a series of lamps came on somewhere behind me. I knew before I turned around that whatever was in that room was going to be nothing short of horrifying. I didn't want to see it, but I didn't want the Professor coming in after me either, so I picked up a small table not unlike the one in the hallway outside, and wedged it beneath the handle of the door. Locking me in, and *hopefully*, locking him out.

I took a second to prepare myself, then I turned around.

I am not a religious person, but if there is a hell it is without a doubt the bedroom of Professor Ismay.

What was once most likely a regular bedroom was now a repulsive flesh-pit. The floor, walls and even parts of the ceiling were coated in a thick wet mass of what looked like rotting meat and excrement. The bed was a mound of brown filth that rose from the hellish coagulate around it, like some abhorrent plinth from which to reign over the rancid desecration the Professor had created. Black hand and footprints showed signs of his travels across the ceiling and walls. Bones were strewn about the place, and amongst the various carcasses of chickens and other rotten fowl, there spawned thousands upon thousands of maggots that gyrated and pulsed in grotesque little gatherings.

I threw up.

Despite all this, the most disturbing things in that room were the orbs. Collected in small piles in various places across the rear of the room, dozens and dozens of white orbs rested in groups upon the filth. They were glossy and white, like billiard balls held together by some sort of membranous slime. Upon closer inspection, the orbs seemed to be dark inside, though I dared not touch them to find out why. I had a pretty good idea anyway.

I sat in that room for about twenty minutes. I just didn't know what to do. I tried praying but gave up quickly. I needed to get out of the house. But there was only one way out of that room. I had first thought to break the window, but when I looked closer at where the Professor had made his attempt, I saw that the glass was imbued with a metal wire mesh. Without a few power tools, I couldn't go through the window no matter what I did. I knew I was gonna have to go back through the house, but that meant trying to get by *him.*

I trudged through the slime and pressed my ear to the splinter-ridden door. I could hear the clicking out there, and the faint wet thud of his footsteps. He was nearby, but it sounded as though he was moving away. If I could get to the top of the stairs I could see the front door, and if I could get to the door I might have a chance.

I slowly moved the table away from the door. I could hear his footsteps again, but they were faint this time. I thought he might be in the kitchen or somewhere near there. I held the knife at stomach height and switched off the lights, then I slowly opened the door.

There was absolute silence, and then suddenly a loud whirring sound came from somewhere in the house, like someone had fired up a grass strimmer. I froze and listened. It only lasted a few seconds before it stopped, and then it began again, this time much louder, and for a longer period. He was moving closer. I heard the wet thwacks of his footsteps and he entered the foyer, and when I saw him I realised what I had just been hearing.

The long drooping appendages hanging from his back were unfurled and flat. They were wings, like those of a dragonfly. Long and transparent, with thick veins running through them that pulsed with a black fluid. They would twitch occasionally and then fire up again. In the open space of the foyer, the echoing sound was tremendous. I watched in awe at the sight of him, grotesque as he was. What had he become? My amazement quickly changed when he turned my way.

He saw me.

I felt with every fibre of my being the way I imagine any prey animal feels when faced with a superior predator. He clicked and trilled, regarded me curiously for a moment, then jumped into the air towards me. His wings sprung to life and began that tremendous buzzing once more. I ran deeper into the house, down the long hallway of the first floor. I had never been further than the Professor's room before, each door was as unknown to me as the last. I could hear his terrible wings close behind me, then the wet thumping of his hands and feet as he clung to the ceiling above. I turned a corner and kept running, hitting a large white door at the end of the hallway. I pulled it open and was suddenly thrown inside by the force of the Professor crashing into the door moments later.

I pulled the handle towards me and managed to find a small bolt lock just above it. Something was hitting me in the face in the dark, something small. When I pulled at it a light came on above. I was in a small washroom. There was a toilet, a sink and a small window on the back wall. The professor was pounding and scratching on the door, desperate to get inside. I was hyperventilating, sweating profusely, and my heart threatened to break through my chest. In my desperation, I tried speaking to him.

"Professor Ismay!" I called out.

He either didn't hear me, or he did. I wasn't sure which one was worse. He just kept attacking the door with a fury that I had never thought possible. I knew the wooden door wouldn't last much longer, and once he got through I was surely going to die.

Suddenly I remembered the window behind me. The fall might be the end of me, but it was a chance that I was going to have to take. I climbed on the toilet, unlatched the window, and peered down at the ground below. It was a long drop, but I would probably live. I passed my legs through first, holding on to the window sill with my elbows. I saw the door bounce in the frame. I lowered myself down so that I was hanging by my fingers, and then let go.

I hit the muddy ground hard and cried out. I was immediately soaked by the rain, and I was pretty sure that I had broken my ankles. I was in terrible pain, but I was out. I was free.

I crawled. I crawled on my belly using my arms to pull me through the mud until I reached the tree line. I couldn't hear Professor Ismay anymore, but he was quite far away at that point. I kept on, crawling and crawling until my arms and hands were bloody and caked in dirt. Until I had worn holes in my trousers and caused my knees to bleed. I crawled through the early morning rain until I reached the road on the other side of the woods and fell out into the oncoming path of two bright lights. They stopped in front of me, and I heard nothing but the rain.

I shielded my face from the light as someone stood over me. They tried to speak to me, but I couldn't understand them.

"The house... the house..." I said weakly.

Then I passed out as the sound of their voice became muffled and distorted.

**Days 17-23**

I was taken to hospital in the early hours of that morning. A truck driver had found me on the road. Nearly ran me over apparently. I have lacerations on my head, though they are not too serious. Both my ankles are broken (as I expected them to be) and I have multiple cuts and bruises from my crawl through the woods.

I have spoken with doctors and police officers about what I have seen at that house. I told them about the meals I was making, about Elizabeth and Agnes. At length, I told them about Professor Ismay. You might not be surprised to hear that they didn't believe me. I was placed under observation by some head doctor or whatever. They told me that I was going to stay at the hospital for a little while so they could keep an eye on me. One of the police officers was kind enough to fetch a few things from my house. Mostly some clothes, my toothbrush, and this laptop I'm using.

I've spoken with one or two officers a few times now. They told me that they found Elizabeth Ismay dead in her bedroom. She had apparently taken her own life, leaving some sort of note expressing shame or guilt about her father's condition. They found Agnes at the top of the stairs, though they wouldn't say how they were treating her death. They also found the Professor's room. When I asked them about Professor Ismay, they said they hadn't found him. At least, not *all* of him.

They claim to have found what they said were 'folds of skin and hair' in the hallway of the first floor. The bathroom door had been destroyed, and there was a strange footprint on the toilet seat that they couldn't identify.

This brings us up to now.

It's been twenty-three days since I went to that house looking for a job. My life will never be the same.

I can't say that I understand what happened to Professor Ismay, or why it was allowed to go on for so long. I know I played a part in it, and for that, I will forever be ashamed of myself.

Sometimes when I'm asleep at night, I can hear the terrible thunderous buzzing of his wings and the gnashing of his teeth. I wake in cold sweats with my heart pounding. I can never tell if it's a dream or if it's real. I don't really want to know.

The police won't tell me anything more. I don't know what's to become of the house or the sordid contents within.

All I know is that when I eventually leave this place, I'll move somewhere far away.

I'll keep one eye on the sky, and a knife in my back pocket.

Just in case.
