I typically take my dog for a walk every night around dusk. The trails are muddy and untrimmed. There’s poison ivy on both sides. Vines even climb the plated conifer trunks. The path weaves over and around bubbling rivers which overflow into soggy swamps when it rains too hard, much like it has been. 



We are new to the land, the hound and I, but still, we learn it well. Last night we went toe to toe with a bobcat. My hound snarled and chased it into the brush but I was able to pull her back without too much trouble. 



Tonight, we saw something different. The sun had just set past the canopy and night was beginning to fall. Now, don’t get me wrong, this land is tough to traverse and well secluded but not as far as you may think from town. We had just made it passed the main river, whose banks rose almost as high as the fallen trunk we used to cross it. Now and then you could hear a loud truck or motorcycle opening up on Route 3 in the far distance and on that same road we heard a firetruck let his siren loose.



Immediately after, the howls began. First, it was just a few then it became a chorus. They rang at different pitches, deep and strong up to high and whiny. My hound made the mistake of barking back.



In an instant, everything became quiet. We stood still beneath some low-hanging tree limbs when the dogs began to emerge from the briars, one by one. They sulked and snarled and barked back at my hound. 



One long-haired mutt led their pack. He moved towards us without fear, brandishing yellow rotted teeth and matted blonde fur. My hound ran for safety and I followed close behind, not far from the chasing pack. We splashed through the swamps, with little regard for the roughly etched path. Every time I looked back they were there, hungry and close.



She went the wrong way. I screamed and commanded her to come but fear overcame her. She tucked her tail between her legs and dropped to the ground. I was left with no choice but to follow her knowing damn well they would shred her to bone if she was caught.



With my brisk encouragement, she was able to continue. We made it to the river and trudged through without hesitation. The water was almost up to her neck and well past my knees, but the pack wouldn't cross to our side. They stood, yipping and barking, managed and feral. 



They were unkempt and tattered. One resembled a mastiff, but thin and sickly. Another looked like a labrador with patches of fur missing. They all brandished yellow, with broken teeth and one even had a frayed collar around its neck. 



I use an app on my phone called Neighbors and often people post about their missing dogs, some of which are resolved and found, but some never are - they remain lost and alone. Without a home or owner, they find a way to survive, somewhere out there, among their kind, in the rising swamps. Feral, and hungry.
