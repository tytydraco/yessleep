Let's start this off my saying, I usually don't believe in many things. I like science, and thus I like explanation. I like things making sense. 
Werewolves, vampires, Bigfoot. Make no such sense. They can't be logical so why believe in fairytale? 

I guess this is my own karma for not letting my mind open wider. 



It was a Saturday, I live in the south so. It's still a bit cold- not uncomfortable. There is a nice breeze but wearing a jacket wouldn't be too bad. (You'll see why I added this later) 

I was alone at home, and bored. My boyfriend was out of town and my other friends have work. I work from home and as of that moment, nothing was going on. I decided it would be...motivating I guess, to go for a walk in the trail behind my house, it was a nice day. And the trees were pretty to look at. 

Now my boyfriend doesn't like me going out alone- not because he is controlling, no he is a sweetheart. It's because he is worried about me, he always claims that
"The woods watch you I swear" blah blah
Of course, I didn't believe him because that's completely stupid. 

So I get my shoes on, throw on a thin jacket. And leave. I wanted the fresh air, and the nice quiet the woods gave.
And that I got, it was a calm walk, about an half hour in though I thought I started to hear the crunching of leaves. 

I dismissed it as a deer, or fox. They are very common in my area. So I felt no worried or anxious feelings. 

A good maybe 10 minutes of walking later, I did see a deer. However, this deer was not what I was expecting.  Right there, jusy right on the trail. Was a dead deer. 

I honestly don't even think dead helps describe it enough, the thing was slaughtered. It looked like it's been sliced up the stomach to its neck, it's guts were just spilling out of it.  It's head almost seemed to have been snapped, one of its legs were missing. And blood covered the ground around it. 

The smell hit me harder than the general shock of it. It smelled completely horrid, not even that of well- something dead. It smelled like rotting flesh and even wet dog? If that makes sense. 

I said rotting flesh, but the kill looked fresh. I didn't touch it but I wouldn't have been surprised if it was still hot. 

I decided that was definitely enough, I walked for about an hour anyway, time to head back. 
I just backed away from the deer and swiftly started to head back. Not wanting whatever killed it to come back to take it away to eat while I was nearby. 

Everything seemed calm and nice, until I heard the sound of crunching leaves again. I swear I felt eyes drilling a hole into me, I looked around but nothing. Nothing at all. So why did I hear leaves? It sounded close, as if it was just a few feet away. 

This caused me to speed up more. 

Now I could see my house at the end of the trail, sighing in relief I slumped my shoulders and relaxed. 

As I stepped off the trail and into my back yard, thats when I heard it. A low growl

I was on my back porch, I froze. I turned to look back at this noise and there it was

A wolf, ok well thank goodness. Now my damn worries were answered. 

Well not really, there aren't wolves were I live. So I was confused. 

It was just, staring at me. It had no threatening stance, no odd posture. It just stared at me with unblinking eyes. 

I mean it was as if it was a taxidermy piece. The only thing thay moved even slightly. 

Was it's head to follow me, I was backing up to make my way to the back door. 

I touched the handle and shook my head. Maybe it was just someone's lost dog. 

Thats when i saw it. It's breathing, I saw a cloud of breath leave its nose. As if it was in the winter. This brought me into further confusion. 

But thay confusion quickly turned to complete fear as I watched this wolf, this thing I guess

Stand up on its back legs, his head not moving as it just stared at me. Un-blinking. I still remember those vivid blue eyes. 

I stumbled to open the door and quickly shut it and locked it behind me. I closed the blind because hell no I wasn't gonna let that thing look in at me. 

After a few moment I brought up the courage to inch my way over and peek out the blinds. 

It was gone. 

Good. 

I stayed in the living room until my boyfriend got home. Let's just say I did get sympathy from my story- 

He believed me, which relaxed my mind. He even said he had some odd experiences himself with the odd wolf. 

however the one thing he did say was a good 

"I told you so" 

Yeah I shouldn't have went alone. I know that now. 


I don't know what I saw, but I haven't seen it since then, it's been a few weeks now. I still fear it though, those eyes and how motionless it was.  I still see it in my dreams..

It still sees me in my dreams.
