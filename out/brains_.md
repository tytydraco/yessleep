The homeless people who come into the ER have no brains. I work in an ER near San Diego, and the homeless people who come in are not normal. Normally, if someone comes in, you'll sometimes see something unusual, like trench foot on someone. Other times, it's full-blown human mites or infected needle tracks that create giant buboes of pus.

But in the last few days, homeless people have been coming in… without their brains. Not like their heads have been cut off or we’ve just received a body, but they walk in and sit down in the lobby until someone starts taking care of them. As soon as we get an X-ray, there's nothing there—just the remnants of a spinal cord that keeps them alive. No surgery marks. No signs of trauma to the head.

They walk in, eyes glazed over, and we start taking care of them. And they have no brain. They don't react to pain, and they just stare at you.

The first one was a 75-year-old man who was starting to suffer from dementia. He was a good guy and had been living on the streets for years. He was a self-proclaimed wild child who would go around picking flowers, making bouquets, and selling them on the sidewalk. He had come in before for an abscess on his lower back. He wasn’t a drug addict, but he didn’t really take care of himself. Eventually, he started complaining about seeing spirits—things beyond this world, especially after a meteor shower. He went missing for a few weeks, and the whole community looked for him. He was a good guy, just a little odd. When he came into the ER that night, there was nothing behind his eyes.

People talk about the "thousand-yard stare," but this was different. Usually, there’s still some semblance of a soul behind those eyes—something screaming, trying to get out. But with him, there was nothing. We originally thought that he needed his abscess drained or dressed properly, or maybe he just wanted a bath and a hot meal. We got him into the back and let him rest for the night, but in the morning, he was sitting in the hospital bed, eyes wide open, just staring. I tried talking to him, coaxing him to eat, but he didn’t say anything—just stared off into space and did nothing else. Everyone on staff grew worried, so we ran every test we could, eventually ordering a CT scan.

In the space where his brain should have been, there was nothing. The worst part was that there was no trauma. Normally, if part of you were cut out or ripped out, there would be signs of surgery or fractures to the skull. Scars. Anything. But there was nothing. We tried taking care of him, and eventually, he was placed on hospice. I would visit him sometimes, bringing him wildflowers, hoping they might bring him some comfort, even though there was nothing left of him. Maybe his soul found comfort in those wildflowers. The day he died, the community came together to have him cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the ocean. We weren’t going to hold him in an urn or bury him. He wouldn’t have wanted that. Now, he could spread and feel the sea, going wherever he pleased.

A few months went by, and things were calm until the next person came in.

I knew her. She had given birth at the ER and had to give up her baby. She was a sweet young woman, around 24 years old. She had been kicked out of her house when she got pregnant and had to give up the baby at the hospital. She would come in for a shower, and we’d always check on her. She had recently gotten a job at a deli and was excited about getting an apartment and finally having a life. She hoped she could even get custody of her child.

The night she came in, she slouched down in the corner of the ER, and for hours, no one spoke to her because she didn’t approach anyone. It was normal for people to come in and sleep when it was cold. Eventually, someone from admissions brought her in the back and let her sleep on a bed. But in the morning, she hadn’t slept. She was still awake, her eyes wide open.

We thought it could have been an overdose or that she was on drugs or drunk—just something to explain her state. We ran all the tests, including a CT and X-ray, and there was nothing again.

She was sent to hospice, and her parents showed up to take care of her in her last few days. Eventually, it started to become a pattern.

At least once a month, a homeless person would walk into the ER, and when we did the CT scan, they would have no brain. And it was always homeless people. On certain days when the moon was full, the homeless would come in, and they would have no brain.

Some bigwigs started coming in to investigate what was happening in our town, trying to figure out why these homeless people were missing their brains. But eventually, they went missing too. Their employers would come by asking for updates, but there was nothing. Eventually, one of them was found in a dumpster, dead, missing their brain.

Curfews were put in place, and churches started opening their doors to the homeless so they would have a place to stay at night. But again, people started going missing or ending up in the ER with their brains missing. Not even the curfew stopped it. Eventually, homes started being broken into. More and more people began losing their minds.

I remember finding one of these households a few weeks ago. It was during a normal morning run, a habit I picked up in college. As I turned the block, I saw that one of the neighbor's main bay windows had been broken. There were claw marks all over the roof. And they had no brains.

Evacuation orders were given a few days ago. Of course, there are a few stubborn people who refuse to leave their town, their home. I refuse to leave the people of this town to rot and die.

I've been holed up in the hospital since the evacuation orders were given. People come in dazed and confused, and they're always missing parts. Some days it's kidneys; other days it's livers. Most of the time, it's their brains. There are only about 100 people left in this town, and I refuse to let them die without kindness. I'm one of three medical staff still left here. I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m worried that this event may spread. When there are no more people and no more brains.
