Hello World, my name used to be Eric. I was just a 19-year-old who got too curious. I'd always had an obsession with the truth—government conspiracies, secret societies, the dark web. I thought it was harmless. I thought I was just some bored kid digging through internet rabbit holes.

But when I started investigating the elite—*them*—things changed.

They’re not a myth. Not just rumors. They’re real. They call themselves the Illuminati. And they saw me. They saw what I was doing.

It started so innocently. My mother would send me texts about everyday things: groceries, the weather, how her plants were dying in the kitchen window. She was a soft, gentle woman—never involved in anything that seemed dangerous. At least, not that I knew.

But one day, I called her, and it went straight to voicemail. That’s not like her. I called again. Nothing. I began texting. No replies.

Days passed, and the silence gnawed at me. I called the police. I posted missing person reports online. I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat. I was drowning in worry, trying to understand what was happening.

Then, it happened. At exactly 2:37 a.m., the doorbell rang. No car, no footsteps, no shadows under the door—just a sudden, eerie silence, like the world held its breath.

I opened the door.

It was a small, black box, sleek and velvet, sitting perfectly on the doorstep. There was no return address, only my name, etched into the surface like a scar.

I opened it.

Inside... was her head.

Her face frozen in a final scream. Her mouth half-open, eyes wide, filled with terror. Her blood-streaked hair matted against the skin, the faintest remnants of life still clinging to her. Her body had been stripped from the neck down, and the severed skin and tendons around her face twitched and spasmed.

A VHS tape lay on top of her. Who even uses VHS anymore?

I watched it. I had no choice.

The tape showed her. She was alive when they began. When they made the incision, her eyes welled up with tears, her lips shaking, her body trembling, but there was nothing she could do. They began cutting—slowly, deliberately—removing her limbs, severing her spine. The camera zoomed in on her face as she gasped for air, her screams echoing through the silence of the room.

Then they did something worse.

They made her speak to me. Begging for me. *“Eric, please, save me! I know you’ll come for me! Please!”*

And those voices behind the camera, so distant, so cold, they laughed. They *laughed.* It wasn’t just laughter. It was the sound of my soul being ripped apart.

I lost it.

I swore revenge. I gathered everything I had—files, secret names, encrypted links. Anything that would lead me to them. I was determined to make them pay.

But they were already watching.

Before I could leave my apartment, the walls began to *move.* They rippled like water. The air around me thickened, as if something was breathing through the very fabric of the room. A sudden force hit me from behind. My head slammed against the floor. My ears rang as I saw black robes, ancient symbols carved into pale skin. Cold, lifeless eyes stared down at me. A figure loomed.

Then... darkness.

I woke up in **The Dungeon**.

The name doesn’t do it justice. *The Dungeon* is an understatement. It’s a living nightmare that stretches beyond anything even Hell could offer.

The air was thick with a smell I couldn’t place—metal, sweat, decay—but it clung to everything. There were no windows, no light. I couldn’t tell if it was day or night. The cold was so deep it felt like it was inside me. It was as if my bones themselves were frozen, chilled to the marrow.

I could feel them. Watchers. Their eyes were everywhere. But I could never hear them. They were the shadows.

They didn’t speak.

They didn’t need to.

The moment they strapped me in, they were already deciding how to break me.

My body was chained and suspended, arms stretched out like a marionette. Time didn’t exist here. Hours, days—they all bled together in an agonizing blur of silence. Nothing. No words. No sounds. Just my breathing. Just my thoughts... or at least what was left of them.

Then came the first noise—a low, agonizing hum. It was faint at first, but it grew. The sound of metal scraping against stone. Bone cracking. Flesh being twisted. The sound of a body being *mutilated.*

My heart beat faster. I strained against my restraints, but there was no way out.

Then they came for me.

They took my eyes first.

I didn’t even realize what was happening until the *burn* hit. A sharp, blinding pain. Then the cold sensation of something being *removed* from me. They sliced through my pupils with precision, cutting them out piece by piece like they were plucking petals from a flower. But I didn’t scream—not at first. I couldn’t.

They didn’t stop.

Next, they peeled off my lips. Surgical razors cut into the skin with methodical slowness, flaying the tender flesh like a butcher carving meat. With each slice, the blood poured, the open wound stinging like a thousand cuts. The feeling was indescribable.

When they were done, my face was a permanent smile—*no lips.* Just exposed, gnarled tissue and blood.

Then came the teeth.

Each tooth was ripped out, one by one, with pliers. Each tooth was twisted, pulled, until the roots snapped. They crushed them slowly in front of my face, just to hear me *beg.*

I couldn’t scream anymore. I had nothing left. They took it all.

They moved to my arms next.

They didn’t cut them off—no. That would’ve been too quick, too kind. Instead, they carved into my muscles. They sliced through tendons, stripped away nerves, until my arms were nothing but useless meat hanging from my shoulders. They flopped, jerking with every movement, useless. I couldn’t even lift them. They had taken my strength, my ability to defend myself.

The days passed in complete darkness. I don’t know how long I was there. Time stretched and broke. The silence was oppressive, smothering. I began to lose my mind.

But the worst part?

The worst part was when I finally broke down and screamed, *prayed to God.*

Nothing came.

No angels. No answers.

Then, one day, there was a voice.

A man stood in front of me, a silhouette in the dark. He wore a blood-stained lab coat. One eye was a dark, mechanical orb, the other human, pale and unfeeling. His name was Dr. Kasriel. He had once been one of them—a high-ranking member of the Illuminati. But he had *turned.* Left their fold.

He didn’t explain why. I didn’t care.

Dr. Kasriel injected me with a syringe that burned like molten metal. He called it Serum 33-A. The pain exploded inside me. The world shifted, crumbled, and then...

Nothing.

I felt nothing.

All of the agony, the sorrow, the despair—they vanished. Just gone. As if they were never there to begin with.

The serum made me something *else.* Something more than human.

He replaced my eyes. They weren’t just enhanced—they were augmented, pure white with black veins running through the irises like lightning. I could see everything—every detail, every nuance, every movement. I saw through the flesh of my enemies. Their fear. Their sweat. The heartbeat of everything around me.

My arms... my arms were transformed. Titanium. Muscular, hydraulic, unbreakable. I could lift a building with ease. Every muscle, every joint now powered by mechanisms stronger than human limits. My fingers, each one capable of snapping bones in half like brittle twigs.

Then he gave me teeth—golden teeth, polished and perfect. They gleamed in the dark, shining like the stars on a dark night. When I grinned, the light reflected off of them like the blade of a guillotine. It was the last thing my enemies would ever see.

When he asked me my name, I didn’t hesitate.

I called myself **Aiken.**

It felt right.

I looked him in the eye. I had no emotions, no rage, no sorrow. Just cold, pure understanding.

“You know I’m going to kill you, right?” I asked.

He smiled, knowingly. “Yes.”

His purpose was to create me. To make me a weapon. To release me onto the world.

I crushed his throat like a twig, then tore his head from his body.

I kept it. As a trophy.

Now, I walk the world again. But I don't belong in it. I am a *monster*—something beyond human. I am a reflection of every ounce of suffering they inflicted on me. I am the embodiment of their darkest, most twisted creations.

They thought they could control me.

They didn’t kill me.

They made something worse than death.

I am the echo of every scream they silenced. The wrath of every soul they tortured. They wanted a secret. They made a storm.

The world doesn’t know it yet, but it’s already ending.

I don’t kill for justice.

I don’t kill for revenge.

I kill because it’s all I know now.

They took my lips.

But my grin never leaves.

And the last thing they’ll see before they die…

...is the shine of gold between my teeth.
