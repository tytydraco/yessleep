"My name is Joshua Anthony Davis, my wife is Melanie Davis, we live in Allentown Pennslyvania, and I have been searching for my wife ever since her disappearance some time ago." 

This is what I tell myself everyday, I keep that mantra in my mind and close to my heart. One summer a few years ago, my wife and I went on a hiking trip, we drove several hours out to a well known hiking trail in the Pocono mountains, eager to spend a night camping in such a gorgeous environment. We are avid hikers, we encourage each other to do a handful of outdoors activities such as kayaking, fishing, occasionally hunter, but Melanie is a bit squeamish, and most importantly hiking. 

We have been trailblazers for about four years now, that's what we like to call ourselves since we never like to leave the trails. We are adventurous but not that adventurous. On this one instance to the Poconos we decided to camp, we haven't camp anyway we didn't know, so this was our way of being risk takers. We arrived at the beginning of the trail at about 7am, ready to start a long day of walking, and everything went without a hitch. We climbed for roughly 3 hours before taking our first long break, we were both already tired but we had kept our spirits high by talking about our coworkers and some family members that need to get their lives in check. We had great camaraderie on all of our explorations, even the more challenging ones. 

Soon after our break we came to a fork in the trail, one side went upward and the other seems to travel down. Melanie was feeling adventurous this time around and wanted to go up, a more difficult path, I thought it would be fun too, so I rushed ahead. We traveled up for another hour, which this time we were nearly exhausted, I was already content enough to set up camp and rest for the day, but Melanie wanted to keep going. She was saying she could see something in the distance higher up the mountain, maybe a clearing that can give way to a breathtaking view. I told her I needed to rest, I was tired and my back was beginning to hurt from carrying most of the equipment, so she said she was gonna go up alone. I didn't like that idea, I was very protective of her and I know this area has a large bear population, so I told her I'll travel up but at my own pace. 

She eagerly pulled me up and started trekking ahead of me, mind you I was carrying half of her equipment and food because I knew if she carried it all we would have turned back a mile in. As she is racing up the mountain, I was trudging along, trying to keep up but after a few minutes I lost sight of her. A few more minutes pass and I made it up to the clearing she was talking about but she wasn't there. I looked around a few times before calling out to her.

"Melanie! Where are you!"

No answer. I was terrified, I started taking off all of the equipment I had loaded on my back just in case I needed something. I pulled out my phone and tried to call hers but there was no service on the mountain. I frantically searched around the area but she was nowhere to be found. The trail ended here, she wouldn't have gone any further, I know her, I know she wouldn't wander off like that. 

I looked at the clearing of trees, we were at a high peak in the mountains and you can see for miles ahead, trees and valleys but no civilation. I looked down the peak, thinking she might have fallen but there was nothing, just more trees. I knew we brought with us a small handheld radio in case of emergencies and I turned it on to an emergency response channel and called for help. I searched the area for hours until a rescue party arrived, that was the last time anyone has ever seen Melanie Davis alive.

I'm writing this now because it has been years since this incident, I needed time to collect myself, to get her belongings together and to finally not wake up a crying heartbroken mess. I will never be the same sadly, I don't think I can ever find comfort or forgive myself for not being there for her in what could have been her final moments. That's why for the past month I have been charting a hike back to the same trail I lost her on to see if I can find her or what remains of her. Maybe this isn't safe but maybe it will give me the closure I need to move on.

May 7th
I drove a few hours to the start of the trail, I remembered the trail from the incident years ago, so I came prepared this time and didn't pack too heavy. I brought enough food for a few days, some light snacks, a gallon water bottle, my handheld radio, a map of the trail and any surrounding landmarks, a sleeping bag, a flashlight, a rain jacket and a flare gun. I didn't want to take any chances, also for the past year or so I have been doing strenuous exercises to prepare myself physically for this journey. I know the hike is only a few hours but if I am to find Melanie, then I need to be prepared for anything. I started the hike up and the only thoughts I had were memories of the last time I traveled this path, the mental torture I must endure to make peace with my past and hopefully end my nightmare. 

I travel up for about 3 hours and reach my first rest stop, I drink some water, eat a protein bar and catch my breathe. This feels like the same spot we rested in years ago, I just can't wait for this to be over already. I press on, moving up the mountain until I reach the fork in the road. I completely forgot about this part of the trail. 

"Did the rescue team search the other trail? Did they go down the mountain to search for Melanie? They must've, they had to know about the other trail, they should have searched that trail too, right?"

These questions raced in my mind, I wanted to go down that trail to see for myself but I knew I had to atleast travel the path we did so many years ago. I traveled the upward trail for while, this time not stopping, my heart starting racing, punding out of my heart, as if I was gonna witness a crime scene, a dead body or something truly horrific, but there was nothing. It was the same as it was last time, a beautiful clearing with a view of mountains and trees for miles. I looked around a bit, waiting for my heart to slow down but a thought crossed my mind. 

I looked down the peak into the forest below, it had to go down about fifty to sixty feet, I couldn't make out much but I did see something interesting. I saw the other path. There it is, just beyond a few trees, I can see a slight sliver of it. It looks like it travels down a hill. I knew I had to search that trail.

I made my way back down the trail I was on until I reached the fork in the road. I didn't hesitate, something inside me knew there were answers down this path. I hastily walked down the path, maybe about a mile before I slowed my pace. I started to feel concerned, I should have seen something by now, a piece of clothes, a dripped item from Melanie's bag, but so far nothing. This didn't stop me, I continued forward, staying on the path.

I traveled down for a while until the trail leveled out and seemed to continue into a never ending sea of foliage and a ceiling of trees. It has been hours and I was exhausted, the weight of the equipment paired with the heat were slowing me down. I was running low on water and I was stopping more and more often, but I did not want to give up. I sat down on a mossy rock to get a snack out of my backpack when I noticed something that made my heart skip a beat, the trail was gone. 

I looked in every direction but I couldn't see the dirt trail that I was following all of this time, I must have not been paying attention and walked off the path. I didn't panic, I looked around for a few moments to get my bearings. As I glanced around the forest, I noticed that the trees were thick and similar, as if there were no defining features on any trees, no moss, broken branches or discoloration. I looked up at the sun and it was hanging directly about my head, it must be noon. I decided to wait a while before moving anymore, I can follow whichever way the sun moves and find my direction from there.

As I sit and wait I feel an immense sense of dread and despair, could this be what Melanie experienced? She was lost and couldn't find her way back, could she have been out here for days, starving and alone? Am I gonna end up just like her?

I must have dozed off, possibly from the heat, but it couldn't have been for long because the sun is still above me. I feel like I've been sitting on this rock for hours, my back is killing me from laying here uncomfortably. This feels like the longest day of my life. I started to get agitated and decided to pick up and start walking, I can't just sit here and wait for someone to save me. I started walking into the quiet thickness of nature.

I must have walked for hours, my shoes blistering my feet, my shirt was soggy from sweat and my skin and mouth were dry. I was nearly out of water and I had to conserve it, I was stumbling through the forest, trying desperately not to fumble over but then I tripped. Landed face first into roots and dirt, I rolled over onto my back and stared at the sky. I could make out only a sliver of blue through the overshadowing branches above. I laid there, thinking this is a good place to give up until I noticed the sun is still above me. It hasn't moved. The sun is not moving, the wind is not blowing, the branches are not moving. I shot up and looked around frantically, something is wrong, there must be a way out, I started screaming. I screamed for help while my knees were buried in the dirt, I was afraid and lost.

I wandered aimlessly, knowing there was no way out, knowing that I would be eaten by the unforgiving world. I was using the trees to keep myself up as I trudged on when I grabbed a tree that had a phone on it. A landline phone attached to a tree as if it was a wall in house's kitchen. I stared at it for a few moments before shakily picking up the phone and pressing it to my ear, there was a dial tone. I hung it up immediately, I've gone crazy, I'm hallucinating, I am in the middle of nowhere and there is a phone with connection. There are no wires connecting to the phone. I pick it back up and listen, I dial 911 on the rotor and hear a ring before it is cut off by a voice.

"You know not to do that."

I shoot back, my heart skipped a beat, I drop the phone. I press my hands to my head and fall to the ground with my back to the tree, I'm losing my mind. The phone dangling next to my head from it's cord, I still hear the line connected. I grab the phone and listen hesitantly. I speak.

"Hello?"

"Joshua? Are you okay?" The voice said, a nurturing male voice, one I don't recognize.

"Who are you?" I say, licking my lips as my throat dries up.

"It's gonna be okay Joshua, we are just having problems with the power, we should be able to help you as soon as it's back on." 

"What power? Do you know where I am? I'm lost in this forest and I just want to find my wife." I started sobbing, barely making it through that sentence.

The line starts cutting out and I can't make out a word on the other end. 

"Hello? Please help me! Please!" I shouted into the phone but the line cut out.

I laid there for a few moments, trying to understand what he was talking about, something about power, like electrical power? I forced myself up and decided to keep walking, at this rate if I am found, I'd be deemed mentally insane, so I might as well keep going and make it as far as I can.

As I forced myself through this green hell, I felt a rumble, like an earthquake, but there are never an earthquakes in this area. It shook again, the trees shook and leaves fell all around me and then another, this time stronger and louder. A booming quake that made me lose my footing, I stumbled over but caught myself on a tree, I looked around and only saw trees shaking. It was quiet and I was holding my breath anticipating another quake, but nothing. Nothing at all, no birds or crickets, has it been this quiet the whole time? 

I begin losing all hope, I took my bag off and set it down and rest my back to a tree trunk, I stared off into the forest. 

"Melanie, I'm sorry. I couldn't do it. I... I miss you. I'm gonna die here." 

Suddenly, door opens up, a doorway of the brightest light appears before me. I felt myself losing consciousness and figured this was Heaven awaiting me. A door appearing in the middle of a forest just before I close my eyes. I couldn't stand, so I crawled, I dragged myself towards the light, my only salvation from this suffering. I knew she heard me, she heard my cries and let me in to her, finally. As I neared the exit, I was losing strength, I feared I wouldn't make it and I'd be forgotten in this forest just like Melanie, but an arm reached out from the light, and then another and another. A dozen arms emerged from the heavenly doorway and pulled me through.

There were voices, and lights, people yelling and hurrying. I laid on my back looking at a gray ceiling passing by luminescent light bulbs above me. I couldn't move, I could barely move my head but I saw a face, a doctor talking to me, his voice was muffled just like all the others. Soon I was in another room. I sat in some kind of hospital room, curtains all around me, a needle in my arm and dim lights creating shadows. Soon enough, a group of doctors pulled open the curtains and surrounded me.

"Mr. Davis, I'm Doctor Martin, how are you holding up?"

"What happened? How did you find me?"

"Mr. Davis, you suffered from dehydration and sleep deprivation in our care due to a problem with emergency systems. You were locked in your room for three days with no food or water or medicine."

"What? I don't know what you are talking about, I was looking for my wife, I was in the woods. I don't know what you are talking about."

"I understand this is difficult for you. Your wife died five years ago, she was found and you have been under our care for the past four years. You were a danger to yourself, you developed a narrative that your wife was still out in those woods but she isn't. Her body was recovered that same day she went missing. I'm sorry Mr. Davis, but you have been under psychiatric care ever since you went back to those woods. You went searching for your wife and nearly died believing she was still out there. Your mind has been playing tricks on you ever since. You are here in this room due to a malfunction in our emergency system, which locked every room in our facility and shut down the A/C units. We nearly lost you in there and proper procedures will be put in place. You will recover fine and be placed back into your room momentarily, I just hope we reached you this time."

The doctor slowly turns away, as if his last words were his final diagnosis of a dying man. Everything he said, it took me days to even comprehend it, I was in a room, losing my mind, holding on to the hope of finding Melaine and having some kind of closure. I can't believe it, it's not true, I know what happened... happened. How could I have made up so much in my head, the rescue team never finding her, the years of torment being alone and wandering those woods in search of her. It can't be true.

Later that day I was moved out of the hospital room I was in and transported to a different building. The medical staff there were nice enough and helped me get situated again. They brought me to a room with my name on it, this must be were I've been for the past few years. The latch for the door took some strength for the nurses to open and the heavy steel door opened as if it was floating on air. I hesitantly walked in, looking around before moving fully through the doorway, but as soon as I was through, the door slammed shut and the lock bolted as loud as thunder. I looked around and saw a bed and a nightstand, pictures of Melanie and me sat on top of the nightstand and trees were drawn across all the walls. A forest landscape was scratched into the wallpaper surrounding my room as if a toddler drew it. Paint splattered all over the floor, the lines on the walls looked like they were finger painted. I painted this, this is my cell, I painted the forest in my endless search for my wife, a search that I will never fulfill. I'll keep looking for her even if that means I have to paint this cell all over again. She is in there somewhere, somewhere deep in those deep woods, I will repaint it.
