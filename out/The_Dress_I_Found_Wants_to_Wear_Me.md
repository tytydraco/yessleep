I love thrift stores. There’s something about hunting through the discarded junk of others, searching for the rare gem of a find. Almost all my clothes are second hand from thrift stores, and hand-tailored to my preferences and size. 

I’ve been looking for a 1920s era flapper dress for the longest time. You know the type you see in old movies, with sequins, sparkles and layers of tassels? The kind that blooms when you twirl around? I saw an old movie recently, and just got obsessed with flapper dresses.

I have only three requirements for it - the dress has to be in a deep forest green, be truly vintage, and within a certain size range, for my tailoring skills only went so far. I’ve thus far only found a few in black, one in red, and another forest green one that turned out to be a poor imitation made in a modern day sweatshop. 

So you can imagine my glee when I finally found The One. 

It was in a thrift store that I didn’t even know was a thrift store. I was attracted by a funny signboard it had in its window, one of those with a funny quip about beer being cheaper than therapy. The lady inside came out, and asked if I wanted to browse through some used clothes. Of course I did.

I saw it almost right away. It was smack in the front of the first rack I saw, as if it were the pride and centrepiece of the shop. 

I took one look at the emerald sparkles dancing off it, and grabbed it off the shelf. It was gorgeous. It was everything I had been looking for. A quick check confirmed it was truly vintage. Owned by some chic lady in the 1920s, most likely. 

The shopkeeper tutted. “My, you really have good taste. It’s the top beauty in this store.”

“How much is it?” I asked, not bothering with my usual bargaining strategies, not even hiding the excitement from my tone. 

“50 bucks”, she said. I raised an eyebrow. Given the quality of the dress, the exquisite design and authenticity, I was surprised it was only 50 dollars. 

The shopkeeper took one look at my expression, and went, “Oh I know it’s expensive, but it’s a really pretty piece. All right, for you, 30 bucks. I just know it’s going to look great on you.”

My jaw nearly dropped, but I held it in place. She must have misunderstood my expression, but I wasn’t going to reject a 20 dollar discount.

“Done,” I said, and scrounged up the money while she packed the dress into a paper parcel. 

“There you go! Enjoy the dress,” she said, with what sounded like a touch of relief in her voice. “Thank you,” she added with emphasis, looking me straight in the eyes. 

I was a little confused by her eagerness to sell it, but didn’t think too much of it. My mind was already considering all the best ways to tailor it to my size and how best to dry clean it. 

I didn’t need to wonder when I could possibly wear it. I knew it already. Once a month, my friends and I held a “ball”. It’s just an excuse for us to dress up in whatever outlandish or extravagantly elegant outfit that we might have. You never knew who would show up in what. Last month, I went as a spider. Not a sexy spider. But a full blown furry spider outfit that made me sweat buckets. My spider hung out with a metallic Dalek and a pinup girl look-alike. I call it a ball, but it’s really just a house party with cheap catered food. Still, it’s fun. 

I didn’t sense anything off until the first time I tried the dress on. 

The moment I zipped it up, I felt something in the room. Like the quality of the light changed. Prickles of cold crept up my spine, and I kept looking around, expecting to see something that wasn’t there.

I stared in the mirror, and it felt like someone was staring at me from behind. I turned, but I was alone.

I quickly took the measurements, noted how much of it to adjust, and shrugged the dress off. 

That odd sensation went away. 

I convinced myself that I had imagined things. 
I tailored the dress with no further untoward happenings, then excitedly tried it on. 

Immediately, the same unease swept over me, clinging to me like a sweat-slicked second skin.

I checked the mirror, and despite that overwhelming sense of being watched, I grinned. It was a perfect fit, and everything looked great. The red lipstick I was wearing stood out against the green, but somehow pulled the look together. 

Wait. Red lipstick? I didn’t wear lipstick. Definitely not a siren red one like that. I smacked my lips together, and frowned at the waxy taste on my lips. My smile dropped. I blinked, and it was gone. My lips were a pale pink, as usual. 

The uneasy sensation of being watched rose to a fever pitch. Tingles encircled my neck, tightening. I stepped out of the dress, my heart pounding painfully. 

Unlike the first time, there was no instant relief. The unseen eyes still seemed to follow me, as I picked up the dress and hung it up. 
It faded by the time I was through with making a cup of tea. 

I didn’t touch the dress until the party. 
The moment I put it on, the strange sensation started up again. I ignored it and checked myself out in the mirror. I had bought red lipstick just for the “ball”, after that brief glimpse of how good it would look. 

Something grazed my neck, and I shrieked. It was my hair, I realised. The wind must have blown it against my neck. Hands shaking, I grabbed my favourite crystal necklace. It was a gift from my sister, who was a little bit woo woo. She had told me that it had a protective energy. I believed her. I guess I’m a little woo woo as well.

I wore the necklace, which went just fine with my outfit. Then I hurried out, wanting to get away from the suffocating, awful tenor that weighed down the air in my room. 

That terrible aura followed me out. 

I spent the first part of the party sitting quietly, accepting compliments on my outfit with a weak smile. I was getting increasingly certain that I had made a horrible mistake, wearing the dress. 

A few drinks in, and I was able to shrug off some of the oppressive sensation to mingle and down more drinks. At some point, people started dancing. 

Now I’m a shit dancer. I only know steps like add the salt, add the seasonings, stir the pot, that sort of movements. 

But I danced. I shuffled, hopped, kicked, shimmied, basically danced with a passion I never had for dancing. 

It wasn’t me, though. My body was no longer my own. 

I saw my friends gather round, and self conscious, I stopped. Or rather, I tried to. 

Instead of obeying my command, my body kept spinning, kicking. For a long minute, my body danced, and I was just along for the ride. I tried to scream, to freeze, to clutch my arms to my sides. I mentally screamed at my feet to stop. But nothing happened, and I flew along, whirling, twirling, stepping fast. 

My friends who knew me well just stared, flabbergasted. Those who didn’t, clapped and cheered.

Out of the blue, a crippling despair barreled through my chest. The dancing finally came to a halt.

My limbs fell limp and the energy fizzled out of me. A heavy ache gripped my heart, and it squeezed tighter, tighter. The sorrow deepened, and got so great, I couldn’t breathe.
 
People around were staring at me in concern, faces falling as they took in my crumbling expression.

I made a run to the toilet, and shut the door just before I burst into trembling, wrenching sobs. 

I have never experienced sorrow that great before, that deep, that cutting. 

When the crushing grief lifted, I Iooked in the mirror at my messed up makeup, still shaking with tears. My eyeliner had run down my face, and I looked a right mess. 

I washed my face as best as I could, knowing where my friend’s makeup was in the bathroom. She wouldn’t mind me using it. 

I stared at the running water for a few seconds, so drained of energy I didn’t make a move to turn the tap off. 

The water ran red. I jerked back, eyes wide. Then I screamed. Blood was running down my arm from my fist, which was laced with glass shards. When I looked up, the mirror was shattered. 

Someone knocked immediately, asking if I was okay. 

I turned to the door, crying out about blood, then turned back. The mirror was back in one piece. There was no blood anywhere. 

I gaped at uncracked reflection in the mirror. Then I stammered something about everything being all right, as the knob started to jiggle wildly. Whoever was outside began yelling in a panic,  asking for help to open the door. 

I raised my voice and told them all was good.
 
I left the party soon after. I had to field tonnes of questions about whether I was okay, what I was yelling about, what blood, blah blah. I just told them I was drunk, and mistook my makeup for blood or something stupid like that. 

In any case, I got home, took the dress off, and dumped it in the bin. 

Still, someone was there. Staring right at me. I could feel it. 

I went to bed, ignoring the presence that sat by my side, staring straight at me. 

When I woke up, that strange sensation was gone, and I felt like I was alone again. I was still wearing my crystal necklace. I clutched it tight, and felt sharp ridges against my palm. I held it up to the light and took a sharp intake of breath. It was cracked. Deep cracks that ran through it. I silently removed it from my neck and kept it back in its box. 

I met my friends for lunch. They were worried about me. I told them I was just drunk, that my mind was playing tricks on me. I told them all was good. I didn’t know why I said that. I just felt like they would think I was crazy if I told them what had really happened. 

The craziest thing was, one of them asked about the blood on my hand.  The rest stared in confusion, asking what blood she was talking about, until she began to stutter, no longer certain. I stared at her for a heartbeat too long, tempted to tell them everything. But something stopped me. It felt wrong. Wrong, to talk about the dress, to tell anyone else about it. That it would really screw things up.

The gut feeling was unshakeable. 

So I told her it was just my lipstick, smeared on my hand. She bought it, I think. 

Anyway, I figured if I never put that dress on again, all would be well.

But that night, the nightmares began. It all came in flashes, like pieces of a broken mind. 
I was watching from the doorway, as a man kissed a woman. He was my man. I knew that in the dream, at least. I had never seen him before in my real life. My husband. Kissing another woman. In my own bedroom. I felt the tearing fury and crushing sorrow that didn’t belong to me. 

I ran in, screamed at them, was ordered to calm down and leave. Told by my husband to leave, as he soothed the other woman. 
Then I was in a strange old style living room that somehow felt like home. The same man was explaining to me that he had needs I couldn’t fulfil. That he wouldn’t leave me, but I had to accept the other woman. 

Another flash. I was punching the mirror, screaming in anger. 

Flash. He was leaving me. I threatened him. 

Flash. I was screaming. He loomed above me, choking me. I couldn’t scream anymore. I flailed, swatted at him, wept. 

Flash. I was watching him with his new wife. I reached out to grab him, but he walked right through me. 

Flash. I was being choked again. Back in that terrifying moment. 

Flash. He was out with her, at a dance we were supposed to attend together. I watched in silence from outside the hall, humiliated. 

Flash. He was shoving me to the floor. Choking me once again.

I woke up screaming that night, and the nights after. 

I went back to the thrift store, but the lady who sold it to me wasn’t there. There was someone else, who refused to take the dress back. She was adamant. No refunds. She wouldn't tell me anything about the dress or its original owner either. 

I finally threw it into a bin in a park nearby. 

But the nightmares continued. And an aching need to retrieve the dress kept pulling and tugging at me. I spent all day fighting the urge to get the dress back, and all night terrorised by the nightmares. 

I woke up this morning, my feet cut and sore. I couldn’t figure out where I had cut it. Until I opened my cupboard. 

There it was. The green dress. 

I must have sleepwalked to get it. That’s the only explanation I have. 

My fingers reached for it, gripped in the pull of an unshakeable force. I grasped the dress in my hand, and held it up to me. I wanted to wear it. I needed to wear it. 

It took all the willpower I had to replace it in my cupboard. 

Later in the afternoon, I tried to burn it. I held the lighter in my hand, the lighter fluid in my other. The dress was in a bin. I tilted the can of fluid, but whenever the viscous liquid was about to wobble over the edge, I pulled back. It felt wrong. Like I shouldn't treat the dress with such disrespect. That it was something precious. Something really important. 

After an agonising minute or two, I finally threw the liquid onto the dress in one swift motion. I flicked the flame on and held the lighter above. 

My hand froze. A sudden panic swooped in. I was pierced with terror, terror that I was about to destroy it all. Destroy something beautiful. Something that should be cherished.

I released my finger, and the flame went out. 

I felt it then, a certainty in my bones. All the dress wants is to be worn. It wants a second chance. It’s a beautiful dress, one that promised a lifetime of beautiful moments. It just needs to be worn.

It was the acrid stench of the lighter fluid that roused me to my senses. I was already halfway through zipping up the dress, which held snugly to my body, when I realised what I was doing. 

With a start, I yanked the zip back down and dropped the dress to the ground. Heart thudding, I grabbed it and shoved it back in the bin. 

Then I softened, something hurting in my heart. I picked it up and hung it in my closet. 

Now I’m just sitting here in my living room, trying to drown out its silent call. It wants me to wear it. It’s waiting for me. It wants to wear me[.](http://reddit.com/r/thedarkseas)
