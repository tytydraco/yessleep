It all happened around 6 years ago. I don´t remember exactly which year but i knew that i was around 13 and now i´m 19 so it should have been around spring of 2016. At this point in time, i was living in Nuremberg, germany with my younger brother, my father and his girlfriend.  
We lived in a more seperate area of nuremberg. (to all who know nuremberg a little bit: I was Living in Kieselstein and this is where my this was taking place) 

  
Now it was a Normal morning around 6:30 o clock before school. And my fathers girlfriend told me to go for a walk with our dog before school. So i went. In Kieselstein, there is a big Meadow sorounded by houses.

 it was right dowm my street around 300-400 meters from my house. Now it was still dark outside. I went on the meadow with my dog and detached her rope so she could run a bit. Now a couple minutes passed and i saw someone crossing the meadow at around 100 meters of distance. He came from the direction of the  train tracks. So i thought it might be someone drunk trying to get home in the morning. But his clothing looked off. He was wearing a robe which i think was black.  
At this point my dog had already started barking heavily towards this guy so i was already sure that i wasn´t the only one seeing him.

 He tilted his head once a bit into my direction and i couldn´t clearly see his face because it was dark but i could see that he had somethin red on his Face. Now i dont want to sit here and tell you guys that he had a red and unrecognizable face but i only saw something red where his face should be. 

  
My dog was barking a lot and i didn´t feel comfortable anymore so i reattached her leache and ran of the meadow towards home. Remember when i told you that i only had to walk along my long street to get to the meadow and back home? 

That detail is important for now. 

So i ran of around 60 meters until reaching my street and than around 100 meters within my street. At this point i was out of breath (i was a fat kid) and i turned around. I didnt see that weird red faced limping guy anymore but around 20 meters behind me under a street lantern, there was standing a young woman. she was really really tall and had long black hair. Really thin. with longer arms than what i would consider normal. She was wearing a scarf over her neck and mouth which almost made it seem to me as if she had a small and round pumpkin-shaped head right on top of this super tall and skinny body.   
I was already scared from what i had seen on the meadow so i kept running only to notice that she started chasing me. 

  
Now the house i lived in was right at the turn of this long street. It was bordered by a fence adjacent to the sidewalk so i had to go through a fence gate, through a small garden to my front door and hope that my brother or my dads girlfriend would open the door asap after i rang. 

  
i reached the fence gate, closed it behind me as fast as possible and slammed myself against my front door while ringing my doorbell as much as my fingers would alow me. i turned and so this really tall woman standing at my fence facing me. she was looking at me.

  
As i heared someone unlocking the front door she ran of. And she was even faster than earlier when she was chasing me. When she ran of i saw that she was wearing a small schoolbag for kids. Like those for kids in primary school. It was very bizarre. After the door opened i saw my dads girlfriend and i was so pleased that i made it home safe. 

My brother and dads girlfriend didn´t believe me but my dog was barking at the both of those weird creatures so i know that my dog had seen them as well.  
Years go by and i saw youtube videos about this serbian dancing lady standing beneath street lanterns  dancing. These myths really reminded me of that woman that chased me that morning. But the tall woman that chased me didn´t dance. 

She only ran. she had a weird head, shaped like a honey-melon, was super thin had very long hair,a long and brown down coat and a small backpack for very young children on her back.

  
If you guys want to know more details like the route i went on google maps, i can add them later.
