This is a continuation of events happening at the cemetery I work at, you can find [Part 1 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/bJhUG3T9FR)

After the many years I have spent working as a Night Guard in a cemetery where the only thing quiet during the night are the guards, I thought that nothing would really change.

Thomas has been doing great despite the many attempts of the residents to break him. He had to deal with his first Midnight Run and managed the aftermath surprisingly well. Only about thirty minutes of silent crying as he hosed off the monument of our town's founder. When I mimed if he had seen the gorey display unfold, he nodded in the affirmative. He gestured that he had remained silent and needed something to drink.

I gave him a consoling look and put a hand on his shoulder before pointing at my wrist for the hourly gate check. We separated and checked the gates and I found my own macabre Jackson Pollock waiting near the North Gate.

Every Town has their own collection of Urban Legends and Traditions that have entered into the local mythos. My town is no different with the youth of the town whispering about The Sleeping Shack, The Train to Nowhere, and to my constant misery, The Midnight Run.

While the Sleeping Shack and Train to Nowhere are fairly innocuous; The first is an old loggers’ shack from the mid 1800s and the latter is just a retired steam locomotive from the early 1900s picked over and covered in graffiti. The Midnight Run is a tradition held by the ‘bravest’ teens to prove their valor and gain incredible luck.

In reality, running through a death trap and surviving gives the victor a deep appreciation for life as they witness vengeful abominations massacre those that welcome the nightly terrors inside. Most of the time unwillingly forced to let demonic ideations rip their way inside.

Before Eli had retired we had our most brutal display unfold before us. We had completed our midnight gate check and planned to play some Chinese Checkers with Father Callahan and Mrs. McCarthy when we had to postpone our game night and colorful tales from an excommunicated priest and a bordello madam.

Near the Fountain of Phobetor and Phantasos, which was built by the Greek obsessed grandson of the town founder, we found three high school seniors in the midst of their descent into hell. Emerging from the fountain depths a brass furred beast covered in moss and leaves wrapped its dripping talons around the screaming head of a boy wearing a varsity jacket. The sound of his screams rang out in melody with gagging moans of his friend whose mouth was being filled with the bile from a decomposing serpent made of bark and sinuous limestone. The most unfortunate of the three was unknowingly running towards Eli and myself as a melding of shadows, obsidian, and ravens ripped at his face with razors of tongues. Their pecking and shrieking echoed in cacophony with the trepidation of the uncertainty of souls being minced from their mortal coils.

Eli placed an unneeded but welcomed hand against my chest as we stopped in our tracks. He pointed to a fourth boy running with hands clasped over his mouth towards the North Gate to either a narrow escape or an equally terrible demise. I silently cursed our luck as a I was really looking forward to the discomforted looks and unbridled condemnations from Father Callahan towards Mrs. McCarthy’s raunchy exploits over the lonely traveller and unfaithful husband.

There are never missing persons posters or town-wide manhunts for the lost souls that aren’t waiting at the morning breakfast table. It is part of the town’s unsightly tradition. There isn’t a need to find someone when you know their remains are already in the cemetery. A headstone will eventually pop up in remembrance of the lost soul consumed by the cemetery.

Good fortune finds the people of my town all the time. A series of tiny miracles and lucky breaks as common as a stray cat. No one in search of work is ever searching for long. Our two local cops only ever have to respond to occasional local drunk drivers or marital arguments that can be heard by the intrusive neighbors. When a juvenile panty thief raids the wash n fold it is the town gossip for weeks.

I do not know if the town fortune is because of a consolidation of small town life or appeasement to an eldritch god by frequent sacrifice.

Whatever it might be that leads to the town’s continued prosperity

I do know that I have a responsibility to keep the gates locked.

The duties of the Night Guard keep whatever evils have congregated in an unholy enclave into the cemetery. 

Not all of those forces are malevolent, and some just want to pass eternity with some company.

I might see if Thomas would be up for some chess. It would help with passing the time. I know Father Callahan would enjoy a new pupil to pass on his Grandmaster skills.

Plus a few stories of Mayoral Entanglements from Mrs. McCarthy might bring a smile to his face.

The bad nights aren’t often but their effects linger. It might be a bit selfish but I don’t want it to be just Myself, Isaac and Kyle left with the responsibility of locking the gates every night.

The cemetery consumes the souls of those who enter unwelcomed, but even those who are welcomed in are chained within its bars.

We are free to leave in the daylight but that chain never truly vanishes. Even though Eli and the other former guards are no longer bound to a nightly watch…They are still bound by the horrors that persist in their nightmares.

It may not seem like it would matter, but a thought murmurs in my mind during my downtime between gate checks.

There is no church in this cemetery. No iconography or symbols of holy deities. None of the tombstones or headstones in shape of a cross.

The only religious symbols in the entire place are part of a fountain. Two Greek brothers of nightmares both monstrous and surreal.

The only permanent guards of the night.
