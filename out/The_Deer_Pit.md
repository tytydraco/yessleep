I can still remember how the steam pulsed in steady rhythm from beneath the frozen leaves. 


When I was a kid I had this place I would go to on the frozen mornings of winter. A clearing that never seemed to suffer under the cruel frosts of eastern Tennessee. 


The clearing was set deep in the woods, far enough away from civilization that the sound of rubber tearing across tarmac bled away into abject silence. Living so close to the interstate, even in a town as small as mine, left peaceful moments as a rare commodity. Everywhere I went, I could hear the distant ribbon of passing cars rumbling towards far-off places. 


I treasured the clearing. The pristine silence there so stark and thin I felt that even a single breath might cause it to burst. It had been a balm for my soul, and its warmth a salve for my aching limbs after long days at school. 


Seventh grade was when the cracks began to show, all starting with the disappearance of Heinrich Einsam. Heinrich had been an exchange student from Germany, a pudgy kid with suede blonde hair and eyes the color of emeralds.


I had known him, but only just barely. He had been in town for a couple of weeks. In those two weeks the shifty-eyed kid with the messy hair had yet to make eye contact with me or anybody else. I could recognize it for what it was, an attempt to become invisible. To shrink himself down so small that the starving, gluttonous egos of burgeoning adults might overlook him. 


The trouble with shrinking yourself away from others; whatever scraps of your personhood remain visible are left entirely up to interpretation.


The stories started almost immediately. The tightness of his lips and constant pale shade of his skin twisted by rumor into some latent sign of wrongdoing. 


Heinrich's uncle worked for the department of transportation; specifically in the removal of roadkill. The kids at school would shout accusations at him. Calling him bizarrely terrible names like Rotmouth and Streeteater. None of us were overly surprised to hear that he had gone missing. We figured he had probably just run away. 


The search was exhaustive, with everybody combing through the Waltmart in the center of town and broadening the search from there until we had covered nearly six miles of woodland. I was surprised, at the end of that day, to find myself in the unusually warm clearing. The afternoon heat of summer shrank away as the sun sank in the west. The warm air rose from beneath the leaves caressing every part of me; driving the cool evening winds from my bones. 


The only sign of him was a scrap of his scalp snagged on a tree branch behind his uncle's house. They eventually arrested the uncle, but I got the sense that nobody felt very good about it. As if it were something they did just so they could say that they had done *something*. 


I'm a little ashamed to say I never really thought about him much after he disappeared. I moved on with my life as if nothing at all had happened, because from my perspective nothing really had. Heinrich had kept himself as something distant, an oddity only to be observed. I had never truly come to know him, and thus had never grown to feel any attachment. 


I was twenty-three years old before I even remembered that he existed. Coming home from college to visit my folks, I found the same shrinking tables I had left behind. It seemed as if every year gave cause for one less chair, whether it be death or feud, or simple logistical issues. It hurt in a way that sits just beneath the surface. An almost imperceptible, constant agony of loss poisoning the air. 


When the typical, heated, political discussion arose I excused myself from the situation. Not due to a lack of interest, simply because I felt that whatever ideological victories might be scored wouldn't be worth the chance of another empty chair. 


The woods were as silent as a grave as I trudged past fallen logs. A small family of deer wandered across my path. I remember wondering what life might be like through their eyes. Many people hold animals to be base creatures devoid of real feeling, but I know that's not the case, at least for some.


Several years prior, when I left for college, I had been driving down country roads on my way to the new school. Excitement and possibility danced through my head, the rhythmic joy of it all coming to a screeching halt. Ahead on the road I could see a young fox laying near the median. There were no visible signs of injury, yet even so it was immediately obvious the kit was dead. Its mother and siblings crowded around it,  prodding gently with their noses, and I could hear through my open window the sounds of their gentle whining. It was as if I had found myself in the middle of some disastrously disheartening Disney movie. I don't know if the animals of earth feel all the same things as you or I, but I know without question that they mourn just as we do. 


I followed the deer at a distance, all the while thinking of my own family, and the family of foxes. I was so lost in my aimless, meandering, grief that I didn't even notice when we entered the clearing. 


It was the same as it ever was, the image of swaying trees heaving their heavy branches to and fro. The wind carried sweet, warm air to the treeline where it seemed to wrap around every inch of me. The change in temperature sudden enough that I jumped in slight surprise. A flood of memory broke loose in my mind, threatening to carry me away with the torrent of recollection. Coming here to cry after Sadie rejected my invitation to the dance, bringing my first girlfriend, Heather, to experience the warmth and tranquility which marked this place. 


I was wrenched back from my trip down memory lane by a sudden cacophony of panicked deer calls. I couldn't have looked away for more than a couple of seconds. The deer had somehow disappeared from the clearing, with the sound of their desperate cries now oozing up from beneath the leaf-littered ground. 


I don't know if it was down to the state of my own family, or just a streak of naive caring that prompted me to march out and investigate. The idea of deciding not to intervene never even occurred to me. It just seemed obvious to me that I should help. 


Stomping across the ground, I became aware of a faint groaning clunk, like wet wood under weight. The deer quieted beneath the thumping of my heavy boots until there was no sound at all. 


I knelt to the ground, clearing half-decayed leaves and revealing a wooden surface much the same. I don't know what came over me. Maybe it was desperation to help the deer, or perhaps reckless abandon borne of despair. Maybe even something so simple as "the call of the void." 


I jumped. 

Once. 

Twice. 

And with the third, the boards gave way. 


It's never easy to tell how long you were falling. Each moment stretches out before you, your mind running uselessly at top speed to find some way of avoiding harm. I slammed against a terrain both bumpy and sharp, a great clatter resounding all around me. The smell hit me first, a thousand years of rot coated in a thick sheen of freshly baked bread. My eyes adjusted slowly to the dim light, the hole where I had fallen through acting as the only window. 


I was in a pit. The size of it was impossible to discern amid the crushing darkness, but the shape was easily surmised from the angle at which the walls were set. When finally I could see my fingers, I felt a rush of panicked horror boil throughout my being. The ground here was comprised entirely of bone. Discarded femurs and ribcages intertwined until they reached a point resembling stability. 


I stood slowly, moving with careful steps across the shifting floor. A rogue vertebra sent my feet flying out from under me, and I braced for the pain as my face careened toward the jagged surface. Instead of hard bone, I was met with the warmth of living tissue. Fresh, wet blood coated my cheek as I pulled away from the corpse of the father deer I had seen. 


I scrambled against the wall, struggling to keep my footing as the bones slid effortlessly across each other. My knuckles crashed against abandoned skulls and hooves as I slipped cartoonishly in the stinking darkness. I stared in raw, stunned terror as a tinkling rumble sounded from somewhere deep within the heap of rot; a harbinger of things unknown gliding though a sea of death. The ripple closed the space between us, sliding in seconds through fifteen feet of near-solid bone matrices. 


It stopped at my feet, and for a moment all was still. Then a rattling shuffle began from below the surface. I listened as whatever it was grew closer, shivers of fear racking my body. I was shaking so violently that the bones had begun to displace themselves around me, leading me to sink slightly down into the pile. 


A rotted hand, all horrid blacks and greens with glimmers of stark white below, burst forth—and then another. Slowly, inexorably, the being extracted itself from the tangled mass of putrid, discarded flesh. Decaying viscera lay draped across his exposed skull. All the meat above his upper lip had been eaten away. His ears pustulous craters, writhing with life as the insects living within him fled from his ear canal. The blackness of his empty eye sockets suddenly parted at their midline, as if phantom eyelids had opened to reveal the bloodshot, emerald eyes of Heinrich Einsam. 


Heinrich finished extruding his torso from within the pile. I wished desperately for my body to stop quaking. I wanted to disappear, to become as close to invisible as possible. He turned his gaze to me, his skull rolling limply to the side as he fixed me with a single, blazing green eye. 


"Hey," His voice was a wet rasp, as if he were speaking through a wasp's nest soaked in viscera, "I found someone. Be–neath the bones. You sh—ould see her." 


As he finished the sentence he tried again to turn both eyes to me, leading his head to rotate around to the other side, his jaw hanging uselessly from weak, dry tendons mummified by decay. 


His torso was a writhing mess of maggots, with botfly larva dotting his shoulders from end to end. His chest pulsed loudly with each ragged breath as the pungent air disturbed the insects nested in his lungs. Chittering sounds echoed through the chasm as Heinrich brought himself to loom over me. The foul odor of rot overpowering as he seeped decomposition across my chest.  


"Come with me. Be–low the bones. You have a ho—me here." 


I lashed out with my boot, caving in a large section of his decrepit ribcage and setting swarms of insects to buzz through the closed space. I moved as quickly as I could to create distance, but it was impossible to keep track of him in the endless, buzzing storm. I could feel a million legs crawling across my skin, and I had to swat uselessly at the air to keep them from my eyes. I retched as a fly crawled briefly into one of my nostrils, imparting the stench of rot it carried. 


Heinrich let out a cry of terrible rage; causing another uproar of tiny wings within his chest. The way his agony warbled and wove itself through the wrathful echo of his keening wail caused my head to thrum with horrible pressure. I clapped my hands to my ears and scanned desperately for any possible way to get out. On the far side, near where I had fallen through, there was a ladder leading up to a small hatch. 


My clumsy, panicked feet betrayed me as I moved for the ladder, leaving me sprawled out on the shifting floor. From where I lay feeling the infinite jagged edges of rot-soaked bones poking against my chest, I could see Heinrich emerging again. 


"You entered the pit. You be–long to her now.  Nothing of Her sees the sky. You go be—low." 


His voice stretched wildly between rage and reverence, filtering through meters of dessicated bone and echoing off the walls of the pit. He slid effortlessly through the bones, and I could hear the shifting rattle behind me as he breached the surface. 


He wobbled slightly, as if maintaining balance were a constant effort. His half-devoured skull lolling uselessly from side to side as he swayed. 


I scrambled like an animal, raking discarded femurs and abandoned forelimbs back past my head as I crawled desperately toward the ladder; shards scraping my face as they flew. 


He slammed down, splintering the tips of his fingers into tiny shards. He had fallen short. I didn't waste my chance. Wrenching myself upright, I ran for the exit. My heart dropped as the wet wood flexed beneath my weight. I made it up one rung, and then another, before a searing pain tore through my leg. 


From where he had fallen, Heinrich had dragged himself across the room. A chain of deer thoraxes lay behind him,  a sinewous rope of shadowy darkness chaining them each to Heinrich's writhing form. He had dragged himself up and shoved his devastated fingers through my calf, in behind my shin. I panicked and tried to pull the leg away. The pain brought white hot oblivion bleeding into the edges of my vision as my head swam. The muscles binding my calf to my shin stretching themselves against Heinrich's fingers, threatening to shear away completely. Hot, yellow bile rolled from my throat as the pain threatened to drive me to unconsciousness. 


I was dragged back to reality by the feeling of a splinter slowly piercing my right thumb. The hand had fallen away from the ladder, dangling down behind me. There beyond the tips of my fingers, I could see the gleam of terrible, hungry malice suspended in that cloying, fetid air. He used the fingers planted in my leg for support, sending waves of brutal agony tearing through me. He stretched and writhed until he had positioned each of his jaws around my index, middle, and ring fingers. 


He chomped down, shearing each finger at the knuckle. I sucked the foul air into my lungs as he raised himself up for more, and then there was a horrible tearing sound. The weight of his form had been too much for his dessicated tendons to hold. His wrist had come unbound from his arm. The sudden shift in weight was too much for his tentative sense of balance. He toppled to the ground, casting bone and viscera across the room in a wide arc as he fell. 


I cried in desperation as I willed my battered body to climb. One rung, two more, and I had reached the hatch. I felt the slam of Heinrich's remaining hand against rung after rung as I pushed the hatch. 


Once. 


"It is useless to flee. She will come for you. You must go down there be–low the bones."


Twice. 


"I didn't want to go. Not at first. But she has shown me things. She will show you as well." 


Thrice. 


He clamped his jaws around the rubber of my boot. I yanked wildly, sending teeth careening from around the pit as my shoulder slammed against the hatch. Sunlight burst in, illuminating Heinrich's infested, decaying form tumbling down into the pit. I scrambled out into the afternoon air. 


The sun against my skin gave me a feeling that the nightmare was over, even as disembodied fingers still wriggled in my calf. I carefully removed the hand, the fingers curling themselves in an attempt to hook into my flesh as I pulled each one loose. I stumbled across the clearing and collapsed against a fallen tree. 


My eyes were heavy. The warmth of the sun was richly intoxicating; wrapping me in its embrace and begging me to be still. I looked down at my leg, my fingers. I was bleeding horribly, so I used my belt for a tourniquet on my leg and did my best to keep my hand above my head. I cinched off the belt, suddenly becoming aware of a dragging thump and an incoherent, wrathful voice. 


Heinrich had dragged himself from the pit and up into the clearing; the effort costing him his ragged arms, which lay flopping in piles of shredded rot ripped away from his torso. The remaining flesh of his face had been lost in the effort as well, leaving only his wild, verdant eyes to leer at me. He inched forward now by using his upper jaw to gain purchase in the earth. 


He was about seven feet away when a set of ribs snagged on the edge of the hole, causing the strain to overcome the bonds of his vertebrae. His skull disconnected from his neck with a soft click, his eyes experiencing a decade of decay in an instant. They blistered and boiled away into a greasy, vaporous dust. 


The chain of torsoes with Heinrich at its end wriggled twice before backsliding into the pit. The motion, openly deliberate, drove icy despair into my heart. I began to crawl away, looking back only once when I heard the heaving, ragged, breath of a dying animal. The slam of a bug-eaten paw drawing my eye back to the pit's edge. Claws longer than my ring finger protruded from gangrenous, fleshy stumps. Round, furry ears just barely peeking over the edge. The sound of wood splintering, and the sight of that monstrous paw slipping off the edge were enough to set me sobbing as I dragged myself home. 


A neighbor found me a few miles down the road. I was covered in bites and stings, some of them incurred in the pit and others on the journey home. Dad was hysterical in the hospital, but mom was there for me. She always had a way of setting herself aside when I needed her. Even as she caressed my bandaged hand and petted my cheek, I could see in her eyes how badly she wanted to break down in tears; the mournful wailing of her heart prying desperately at the corners of her mouth. 


Eventually, when I was able to speak again, I told my story. You can guess how that went. It took a few weeks of begging before they'd even bother to check the pit. When the sheriff finally made his way out there, he found Heinrich's battered skull sitting at the edge of a chasm. The empty pit stood thirty feet across, and more than sixty feet deep. They had it backfilled before I left the hospital, but he showed me pictures once. 


The thing I couldn't help but notice about those pictures, beyond how infinite the darkness seemed to grow, was how the hole banked off at the bottom. I couldn't help but shudder in thinking that something massive had tunneled its way out of the Deer Pit. 


Sometimes, late at night, the rumbling of passing cars starts to sound familiar in a way that makes my heart sink.
