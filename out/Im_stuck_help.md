I work as a business executive for a well known company and we had a deal that we were about to close with this other company located in Japan so I had to go to Japan as I kissed my two daughters Maddie (5f) and sibby (12f) goodbye Maddie said

“Where is daddy going” 

“Japan” I said

And as the usual little kid she kept asking questions 

“Is it cold there” “what is it like” “do they have ninjas there”

I looked at sibby and she said

“Bye dad” 

“Good bye sibbles” I said

“Dad I told you not to call me that”

I ruffled maddies hair and took my suitcase and went to the air port as I got there I looked at my flight to see that it was delayed so I looked at the time and it said 8 minutes but the 8 was sideways but then it flickered back so I thought it was fine it was the usual plane ride nice calm and a little turbulence 

As we landed I looked out on top of the beautiful landscape and we landed I immediately went to the meeting and I settled the deal with the company I went to a fine restaurant and then called my secretary to book a local hotel and then she hired a taxi to pick me up then I arrived at the Morin hotel it was nice I checked in and to the 8th floor and went to my room I plopped on the bed and breathed a sigh of relief I went to go smoke a cigar and have a beer on the balcony but when I opened the window it was another room

“What” I said

I climbed over the window and opened the door and nothing unusual so I went to go ask the receptionist what was happening I opened the other door and saw that the door across from me was opened in my confusion i left the door open I looked back and saw that the door beyond the window was open and the other door was too I rushed to the elevator but it was on maintenance then the will stairs will do and went down more then 8 floors I looked at the floor number and it had the same 8 but it was side ways a woman came out of her room wondering what the commotion was about I looked at her and yelled

“Throw up the peace sign”

“Okay” she said 

I went down the stairs only to find that I was coming from up the stairs 

She looked at me and yelled

“AHHHHH”

Then she started crying and I tried to cheer her up and she started repeating

“We’re going to starve” 

Then I started running around trying to find all the food it was about a weeks worth of food 

So far it has been 6 days we are out of food and my phone is at 20% and that women her name is kobeni 

Day 7 tell my daughters I love them I don’t think I’m going to make it

Update 
The lady thinks I am doing this she is locked up in a room right now after she looked at me and yelled

“I know what you are”

She had been crying a lot 

UPDATE 
We have been rescued I finally saw people I yelled for kobeni and she opened the door and saw someone behind me and ran up to them and hugged them and started crying 

I finally got on a flight home and I’m going to see my daughters it’s weird that it’s 1 day after the meeting I was definitely there for 7 days but at least I’ll see my daughters again
