People think they know strange. Hell, before all this, I thought I did too. You see a lot of shit in the military, even more as a private eye. You think you know people. Well, you don't, trust me. There's a whole layer of filth underneath what you think you know. I thought I'd seen strange. Thought I knew weird. Thought I couldn't be shaken. I was wrong. Findin’ the book changed everythin’ for me. You know that sayin’? If you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back? Well it's true. More true than anythin’. All it takes is a glimpse beneath the veil. I wish I had never taken that last job, but it's too late now. I'm gettin’ ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginnin’.

I work in an old port town in the southern USA. The kind of place with rottin’ docks and always smells like rottin’ fish. The kind of place full of superstitious old-timers nd over the top stories. You won't find us on many current maps. This town hasn't been relevant in a long time. I get most of my work from the nearby city. No, I won't tell you which one. Hell, I won't even tell you the name of this town. Last thing I need is more weirdos comin’ here to go missin’ in the nearby swamps. For the sake of reference though let's call the place Portsmouth, nd you can call me James or Jimmy, local PI. Portsmouth is a rottin’ shell of what it was when I was a kid. Used to be a pretty nice place with lots of work. After the fishin' dried up, nd old mine shut down, it kinda just got forgotten about. Who knew that the mine runoff would send the fish runnin’? Who knew the mine would fall short after a decade of steady output? Not my old man. Not any of the other old-timers either, but that's life I suppose. Now the swamplands creep in on one side of us nd the salt water breaks the other.

So it all started bout two weeks ago. I'd just come down from my upper floor apartment down to my office. I was expectin’ a quiet mornin’ but as I walked to my door to unlock it, I saw a letter layin’ in front of it. I picked it up nd looked at the return address. Ellen Peterson from the city close by. Peterson… I didn't recognize the name. Tearin’ the letter open I looked at the contents. A picture fell out of the folded letter as I opened it up. I picked it up nd saw a young dark haired girl, with bright innocent lookin’ blue eyes nd freckles. I went back to the letter.

Dear Mr. Smith,

I write to you out of desperation. My daughter Mary, who came to Portsmouth to visit her grandfather, has gone missing. I've talked to the sheriff, and all I get is “We are working on it.” It's been three days. I know the time window for her to be alive grows smaller and smaller by the hour. Please accept my case. I'll pay whatever you want. You can start by talking to my father, Elias Bell. Thank you in advance. If you need anything please call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.

With all hope and sincerity, 

Ellen Peterson

Elias Bell… I knew the old man, nd I knew her too now. Ellen Bell ran off with some rich city boy after high school. I checked my watch. Pretty early. The old men would be at the local diner. I stuffed the letter nd photo in my pocket nd grabbed my coat. I stepped out into the cold, wet, fish smellin’ mornin’ air. Time to work.

I stepped into the diner nd shook off the mornin’ damp as I looked round. As usual the old-timers were all huddled up at the long table in the back. What wasn't usual was the hushed voices instead of the rowdy banter that usually accompanies em. A voice from the counter called out to me.

“Hey Jimmy, here for breakfast?” Said the plump woman behind the bar top.

I looked over nd gave her a small smile, “Not today Eileen. Workin. I'll take a coffee though.” She gave me a small nod nd waddled to the pot, fillin’ up a cup nd handin’ it to me. I took a sip nd headed over to the table. The hushed voices stopped as soon as I neared nd a gruff voice on the opposite side called out.

“Guess you're here to see me, eh boy?” Said a shriveled twig of a man in orange waders.

“Yea Elias, I’m here to see you. Ellen contacted me.” I said quietly lookin’ him in the eye. You had to be respectful with these old-timers. You didn't show respect nd pay your dues to the water nd they wouldn't give you the time of day.

Elias nodded slowly, “She said she would. That useless fuck sheriff hasn’t done a damn thing but sit on his fat ass in that comfy office. I don't know how a beached asshole like him got voted in in the first place.” Said Elias angrily, his fist slammin’ into the table as the other old men nodded at his words.

Sheriff Johnson was a fat old man who basically just filled his position in name only. Most the time if any real work needed to be done in this town it was me or Deputy Bellham doing it. The sheriff never set foot in a boat in his life, therefore he wasn't respected by a single person in this town. Though he might've earned some if he actually did his job. 

“Give me the details Elias. Tell me what happened to Mary.” I said, leanin’ on the end of the heavy wooden table.

Elias looked down into his coffee cup. The other old men just watchin’ him patiently as he seemed to gather his recollection. 

“She's been stayin’ with me bout three weeks. Honestly I was surprised she wanted to come out. Ain't nothin in this town for a girl her age. Maybe it's because I dote on her, or she just wanted to get away from her folks, I don't know." 

He shook his head slowly for a moment before continuin', “Bout five days ago she said she made a friend. I asked her who, but she brushed me off. She was a good girl, so I didn't push the subject. Next day she went out again, came back nd there was a smell hangin’ on her. I knew it, we all do. That swamp smell. I asked her again, who was this friend? Again she tried to brush me off, but I pushed this time. Asked her if it was one of those swamp-dwellers. She hesitated nd that was confirmation enough for me. Maybe I got a bit stern with her. Told her she knows better. Shouldn't be hangin’ round those swamp folk.” 

He paused for a second nd a single tear rolled down his cragged cheek. “Guess she just wanted to placate me, cuz she said ok, nd she wouldn't see em again. I thought that was the end of it. Went out to sea the next mornin’. When I came back she was gone.” 

An old-timer next to him placed a weathered hand on his shoulder as Elias seemed to sink in on himself. I nodded slowly. Last thing I wanted to do was take a trip to the swamplands, but if that's where the trail led, then that's where I was goin’. 

“Alright Elias, I'll look into it, but you know, three days in the swamp.. You know what I'll probably find right?” I said grimly.

Elias looked me in the eye sternly. “You just bring her back boy. One way or the other nd you'll have our gratitude.” The old-timers all gruffed out their assents.

“Alright.” I said standin’ up, "I'll contact you when I find somethin’.” With that I downed my coffee nd headed out, puttin’ my mug on the bar.

“Be careful out there Jimmy.” Said Eileen with a worried wrinkle in her brow.

I nodded to her as I walked past nd headed back out into the damp mornin’.

As I walked down the pothole covered road I thought about what to do next. I'd need to prepare. No way I was goin’ into the deep swamp unarmed nd I'd need a guide. There was only one person for that. I took a turn nd headed to the bar nearby. Probably the only place in this town open twenty-four seven.

I pushed open the heavy door nd was greeted by the smell of warm booze nd sawdust. Here nd there the local drunks snoozed or talked to themselves in their seats. The lumberjack of a bartender greeted me as I entered.

“Mornin' Jimmy, what can I get ya?” He said in his low cannon of a voice.

“Nothin’ today, Al. Workin'." He nodded nd looked to the lean figure sittin’ at the bar. Henry looked like a cowboy tryin' to become an alligator. Wearin’ blue jeans with alligator boots, vest nd hat. He sat there sippin’ on his whiskey. He was a muscular, tanned man in a small lean kind of way. A large bowie knife was strapped to his hip like a promise.

I came over nd sat next to him. didn't say a word, didn't have to. In all likelihood he already knew why I was here. He side-eyed me for a moment nd downed the rest of his glass.

“When we leavin’ Jimmy?” He said in his smooth voice.

“Soon as you can get ready Henry.” I stared at him for a moment as he put his glass on the table nd pushed it away.

“Give me bout an hour nd I'll have the boat ready.” He stood up nd looked at me. “Dwellers been real strange lately, Jimmy. Strap heavy for this one. Not sure how they gunna’ react anymore.” I nodded thoughtfully as he stepped out.

Sighin', I got up off the stool nd headed out myself. I walked to my office stoppin’ momentarily to look out on the water. The dark blue water splashed against the decrepit docks. A few boats that have seen better days floated by the parts that were still usable. I remembered the days helpin’ my dad load the boat before goin’ out. Everythin’ seemed brighter back then. I wondered then if this town would survive my lifetime. I turned away nd stepped into my office.

I went through my apartment grabbin’ my gear. Camo boots, waders nd jacket. My .38 for the inside pocket. My .44 on the side of my hip. I debated on rifle or shotgun. In the end I went with the shotgun. I filled my pockets with ammo. When it came to the swamp nd the dwellers it was best to be prepared for anythin’. Was a time when the dwellers nd us got along alright. These days though they were almost completely isolated nd didn't appreciate visitors. If Henry said they were even stranger now.. Then I wasn't really sure what to expect anymore. I grabbed a backpack with some extra gear. Rope, tape, tarp, whatever might be useful if we got in trouble or had to bring back Mary in the worst case scenario. 

I stepped onto the docks, the weight of my gear remindin' me of my time in the army. Henry sat in his flat bottomed boat. Rifle slung over his shoulder nd pistol strapped to the hip where his knife wasn't. I tossed my bag in nd climbed inside. Henry lit a cigarette before startin’ up the motor. He took a drag nd started movin’ away from the dock. 

We headed up the coast. When we reached the channel that would lead us to the swamplands I looked up from inspectin’ my weapons.

“So how bad is it now, Henry?” I said watchin’ him expertly guide the boat.

Blowin’ out a puff of smoke, Henry looked back at me. “Pretty bad Jimmy. They're more paranoid than ever. More dangerous. Last month I came out to check my traps. Caught one comin’ up behind me, knife out. Fucker was covered in swamp mud, practically naked cept some cloth round his junk. Felt like I was seein’ tribesfolk in the Amazon or somethin’. Couldn’t understand a word the fuck said either before I made him silent.”

I looked at Henry for a long moment. There's an unspoken rule out here. What happens in the swamp stays in the swamp. It rarely happens but this town sometimes takes justice into its own hands. When they do.. They take it to the swamp. I decided I didn't wanna ask anymore questions nd went back to my inspections.

As we headed further inland the tree growth grew thicker, nd the canopy above blocked out the sun. Henry wove us between the trees nd kept us away from too shallow waters. We were movin’ slow. As I looked round I didn't really notice much of anythin’. Then I noticed that I really didn't notice anythin’. No movement. No birds makin’ noise overhead. No movement under the water's surface. Even the flies nd mosquitos were awol.

“Henry what the hell is goin’ on out here?” I asked in a whisper. I'm not sure why, but I had a feelin’ I needed to stay quiet. Had a feelin’ there were eyes on us. Henry just looked back at me. His expression was like stone as he turned back to guide us through. I readied my shotgun nd crouched into a stable position scannin' the area. I couldn't see anythin’, but I knew they were there. My instincts screamed danger as we moved ever deeper into the dark swamp.

Suddenly below us there was a boom. Before I could react the boat flipped up into the air, water splashin’ up round us before I was sinkin’ down in it. The filthy swamp swallowed me. Its foul taste fillin’ my mouth as I struggled to regain my senses. I flipped nd turned, losin’ all sense of direction. Blindly I swam where I thought the surface was, instead I met mud nd roots. Turnin’ I swam the opposite direction. I finally breached the surface inhalin’ the stale air, quickly lookin’ round for Henry. There was land nearby nd on the edge I saw him. Muddy hands dragged him from the water nd held him to the ground. I looked at the savage muddy faces. I couldn't believe these were the same dwellers. They had become absolutely feral, lookin’ like tribesfolk of some kind. As I looked, a figure stepped from the shadows, a woman bare chested nd covered in mud, wearin’ some kind of tribal headdress. 

She knelt down beside Henry as she pulled out the jagged, wicked lookin' dagger, nd he began to fight even harder against his captors. The woman raised the dagger high above her head shoutin’ in some language I'd never heard before, nd then, she looked at me. Bright green eyes looked at me. Too bright. Too green, or not quite green. Pain started to rip through my head as we stared into each other's eyes, but then she turned away, nd plunged the dagger down into Henry's heart. He gasped loudly as the blade struck home, his body twitchin before fallin’ still.

The dwellers stood then, all turnin’ towards me. Green eyes, but not quite green. Slowly they stepped back into the shadows, disappearin’ from view, but I knew they were still there, watchin’ me as I carefully made my way to the muddy earth where Henry lay. I struggled up the muddy banks to Henry's body, catchin’ my breath nd lookin’ down at him. He was gone. His eyes wide in terror nd slack jawed. Lookin’ round me, the shadows of the swamp seemed to deepen. My head felt tight, like somethin’ was pushin’ it from either side. Images of my time in the desert flashed in my head, but they were different, monochrome in color. Grey sands, black rocks nd dark sky, but there was a light somewhere, a greenish light. 

I shook my head nd reached for my weapons. The shotgun was gone nd so was the .38, but my .44 was still strapped to my hip. I pulled it out breathin’ slow, tryin' to calm myself. I scanned the area, but the light of the day was fadin’ fast nd the dark shadows lengthenin’. I took inventory of my ammo, eighteen bullets includin’ what was already loaded. I reached to Henry's side nd grabbed his knife. Then I moved.

The sun began to dip lower as I walked through the stinkin’ mud. I estimated my direction, tryin’ to move south towards the coast. The swamp grew darker nd darker as I stumbled forward. My flashlight was in my pack, lost somewhere in the swamps murky water. So I kept goin’, stayin’ quiet nd watchin’ my surroundin’s. Now nd then I’d see some movement, but it'd be gone as soon as I turned to look. My head seemed pounded harder the further I went. Eventually the sun vanished, plungin’ me into darkness. Through the canopy above I could see some stars, but I couldn't figure em out. Twinklin’ mockeries of our own constellations, but different enough that I couldn't figure out my directions. So I kept on, hopin’ I was movin’ straight, but knowin’ I probably wasn't. 

“James..” A whisper came from my right. I turned, holdin’ my gun forward in front of me. I couldn't see anythin’ but the shadows. They seemed to blur in my vision nd I quickly rubbed my eyes to try nd clear em.

“Come James..” Another from behind me. I spun, wavin’ my revolver side to side, scannin’ the area in front of me. Again nothin’ but blurred, twistin’ shadows.

I started to run. I moved awkward nd slow, the mud suckin’ at my boots with each step. The whispers came again all round me.

“James.. Come James.. Chosen James..” The cacophony of whisperin’ voices. My head pounded. My disorientation buildin’ nd buildin’ till finally I collapsed into the slick mud. 

Then there was light. Green flames lightin' up on torches all round me, held aloft by mud covered, green-eyed dwellers. I sat up raisin’ my gun once again. 

“Stay back!” I screamed as I waved my gun between the dozen or so individuals surroundin’ me. Then I noticed it. As I moved my weapon in front of me, two more torches lit up revealin’ a stone table covered in mold nd a rust colored substance. Round it were corpses, corpses mummified in a wet, sticky way that only a swamp can produce. Two of em were kneelin’ before the stone table, nd held aloft in their hands was a large leather bound book.

The figures of the dwellers stood in place round me. I stood up, gun still raised nd lookin’ at each of em. Then I felt a pull. Somethin’ in my mind tellin’ me to look forward again. I turned back, my eyes fallin’ on the strange book held up in those skeletal hands. Strange words were etched into the leather. 

Liber Smaragdi Luminis Aeterni

A shadow behind the altar seemed to shimmer nd a figure came forward. The woman from before, her green eyes lockin’ on my own as she approached the table. She raised her hands high up into the air.

“Electus Regis Smaragdi Venit! Gaudeamus in eius lapsu ad insaniam!” She yelled over us, her voice manic nd eyes fevered as she looked round.

I looked closer at her mud covered face as she looked at me from behind the altar. A wide grin spread across her face. Then recognition hit me.

“Mary? Mary, your mother sent me! I'm here to help you get home!” I yelled at her. 

She kept starin’ at me. “Domum sum… in lumine ipsius” She whispered at me.

Suddenly pain ripped through my skull nd I dropped to my knees, my vision blurrin'. I looked up to see hollow sockets nd wide toothy grins meet my gaze. An emerald light began to emanate from their dark eyes as skeletal hands grabbed nd held me down. I struggled with all my might as all round me the flames grew brighter as mud covered figures burst into eldritch flame.

I heard Mary's voice rise up, “Recipe nos, Rex Nativus ex Vacuao!” Another bright green flame grew from the direction of the table. Suddenly two green lights filled my vision. My eyes burned nd my head throbbed nd then, everythin’ went dark.

I opened my eyes to that monochrome landscape. Grey sand nd black rock with a toilin’ black sky high above me, but as before there was a light. A light like liquid emerald floatin’ nd reflectin’ off the monochrome surfaces round me. I turned in its direction to see a tall black misshapen tower of inconceivable geometry. At its top was the source of the light. A figure was there, behind its head a halo of that alien light. My mouth gaped open as I dropped to my knees. It was so close, yet so far away, nd to my horror I wanted to be closer. 

Shadowy tendrils slowly slipped down from the roilin’ sky round the figure. It reached a long clawed hand towards me as if beckonin’ me to take it. I reached out to it, nd suddenly I was there, kneelin’ before the loomin’ figure now only a few feet away from me. It turned its faceless head towards me nd reached down. Its large hand pressin’ to my chest. Pain flared from its touch burnin’ me nd forcin’ out a scream I didn't even realize I could emit from my body.

Its voice ripped through my skull, tearin’ my mind apart with each word. “Awaken child and see truth around you.” 

Then darkness took me once again.

I awoke a week later in a hospital bed. Sittin’ in a chair near me was Elias’s bony form. Images of hollow eyes nd skeletal grins flashed through my mind nd I yelped closin’ my eyes nd pressin’ my palms into em.

“Jimmy.. Boy what happened to you out there?” Elias said quietly. I kept my eyes shut.

“Don’t let anyone in the swamp Elias… nobody can go in there!” I practically screamed at him. 

He stepped back warily. “Yeah, okay boy. I'll tell everyone to stay out. Jimmy.. What happened to Mary? To Henry?” He asked hesitantly.

I opened my eyes then nd looked at Elias with a manic expression. “They’re gone Elias! Gone! There's nothin’ left!” I shouted loudly. Elias ran to the door best he could, yellin’ for a doctor to come.

I spent about a month in that hospital. I've forgotten things. I know I have. Everythin’ here is what I can remember. At least I think it is. Honestly I don't know what is completely real about this story anymore. What I do know is that I see things slippin’ into the shadows from the corners of my eye. I know that I have a certain instinct about things now. I know that when I got home the large leather-bound book was sittin’ on my bed. I know the handprint-like scar on my chest shimmers green in a certain light. I know that when I look in the mirror.. I see emerald eyes starin’ back at me.
