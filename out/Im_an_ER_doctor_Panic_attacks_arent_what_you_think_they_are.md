Sometimes, people really do die for no reason. And I don’t mean a senseless killing or a tragic accident. I mean, that sometimes, the human body shuts down for reasons beyond our current medical knowledge. We know that it starts either in the heart or the autonomic nervous system. But beyond that, we in the medical field are stumped. I’m an emergency physician working in a major city, and I’d like to break the silence on this issue. But that would be career suicide, so I’ll do it anonymously here.

It happens more than you might think. A young, healthy woman goes to sleep and just doesn’t wake up the next day. A middle-aged man collapses on the sidewalk. And we always come up with an excuse of how it happened. The woman’s doctor will dig into her medical history and find out she admitted to doing cocaine at a party in college. Or the middle-aged man’s grandfather died of a heart attack, so he probably had a congenital defect that led to sudden cardiac death. The problem is, a heart attack and sudden cardiac death are two different things, and an overweight 80-year-old smoker having a heart attack doesn’t explain why his 45-year-old half-marathon running grandson’s heart simply stopped beating one day on his way to the corner store.

It’s so much easier to explain away the problem if they have a current medical condition. “Oh, he has diabetes. That’s why his heart stopped.” Never mind that his diabetes was well-managed and he followed his medication regimen religiously. “Oh, she had the flu, which we often forget kills people every year.” Yeah, it does, but not normally 17-year-old varsity volleyball players with no underlying health problems.

Sometimes, the sudden death occurs and causes an accident, which makes covering up the real cause easier. Heck, we don’t even need to cover it up, since half the time we don’t know about it. I remember learning about the condition back in med school during my pathology rotation. I was naturally pretty good at this sub-field and considered specializing in it for a time before going the emergency medicine route. The attending took a liking to me and asked me to take a look at something. I’d like to say I was in the morgue doing extra credit because I was such a badass student, but honestly, if memory serves, I was practicing rectal exams on my cadaver because I hated them and I didn’t want to freak out in front of class again.

I found the pathologist in the adjacent room, looking at the nude corpse of a 38-year-old woman with a Y-incision across her torso. She had bruises and lacerations across her face from an airbag. No damage to her hands or wrists though, which sometimes happens when airbags deploy, but isn’t consistent enough to be suspicious alone. She also had a bruise stretching from left shoulder across her chest, a common injury caused by seatbelts, and I was told the autopsy revealed her spleen had been contused, again, something consistent with seatbelt-related injuries.

The only problem was, that was the only internal damage the doctor could find. Her lungs, heart, and brain showed no significant pathology. She hadn’t bled out internally. Analysis of her blood showed elevated levels of troponin, a marker often used to diagnose heart attacks. But no infarcts were found in her heart. Witnesses said that she went limp before her car swerved off the road. 

Perhaps she fainted, you might think. Just because she lost consciousness before crashing doesn’t mean thousands of people are dropping dead every year from an unknown cause. After all, her autopsy also revealed she had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.03%. So, that probably contributed to her loss of consciousness, right?

Now, you’re thinking like a doctor. Why consider the facts when you can neatly file this away with the many alcohol related accidents that occur every year?

A BAC of 0.03%? What a joke. That’s well under the legal limit, as I’m sure you know. And with no other drugs or even prescribed medications in her system, the likelihood that the amount of alcohol found in a small beer knocked this woman out is absurd to me. She had a history of enjoying a few drinks each week, so it’s not like this was her first time. But her friends and family said she had been under a lot of stress lately and wasn’t sleeping well, so the hospital was able to latch onto that as an explanation. A little bit of beer plus a whole lot of stress and poor sleep. That can make someone lose consciousness at the wheel, right?

If that were the case, everyone I went to med school with would be dead a hundred times over. Heck, not just med students! The whole damn country’s experiencing an epidemic of stress and poor sleep. But it’s more comforting to believe this explanation than the alternative. Let’s ignore, of course, the fact her body didn’t have enough damage to account for her death.

I noticed the Frankenstein cut across the woman’s scalp that meant the pathologist had examined her brain, and I asked if there was any damage to it. He said there wasn’t and asked me what I thought he should do. I told him to reexamine the brain for any neurological reasons the woman might have suddenly fainted. He said he wouldn’t.

When I asked why, he replied, “Because if I don’t find anything, it draws attention to the fact that she died of nothing. Leave just enough ambiguity and the family can make peace with it.”

Those words stuck with me.

You’ve heard about this unnamed, unspoken condition before too. When it happens to celebrities, it makes the news. Thankfully, the media love dragging famous people’s names through the mud, so when they die of nothing, you hear about every unhealthy habit they ever had and every drug they ever took. The cause of death is always some horrible celebrity behavior that us normal people don’t engage in, so we don’t have to worry. And it cracks me up when the media outlets all pick different explanations to run with.

Remember that TV star we all watched growing up who died a few years back? He had engaged in some rigorous physical activity beforehand, so that must have contributed to his heart failure. Except, people with weak hearts usually don’t do rigorous activities. They follow a pretty clear and predictable decline in physical ability before dying. And people who get heart attacks usually get them *during* the activity. Not after. Oh, it can happen, but generally speaking, if a bit of plaque is going to break off and block an artery, it’s going to do it when your heart rate spikes sharply, not when it’s coming down.

I also heard it was the activity combined with overheating from his hot tub. Or no, it was that he actually passed out first and then drowned. No, wait, it was everyone’s favorite culprit: drugs.

And the reality is, no one knows how he died.

A martial arts star known for his extreme physical fitness gets rushed to the hospital with what they said was swelling in the brain. But I’ve also heard he died of an allergic reaction to a headache medication, or water toxicity due to the liquid diet he was on. Heck, I even heard he died because he ate hashish, which is a concentrated form of marijuana that has been linked to zero deaths. Or one, I suppose, if you believe it killed this guy.

What we do know about the condition is that it often causes a sense of dread before setting in. Full-blown panic attacks are seen in roughly 50% of cases. And, before you comment about how panic attacks can’t kill you, let me ask you this: how do you know? How do you know a heart attack isn’t just a panic attack that kills you. Their symptoms are often the same. Maybe an aneurysm is what happens when a panic raises your blood pressure so high it compromises the lining of the blood vessels in your brain.

Remember that pop star from like 15 years back? He died because his doctor wouldn’t say no to him and kept giving him drugs, and then the doctor got in trouble. But what were the drugs he was taking? It was something to help him sleep because he suffered from terrible fits of anxiety. So, did the drugs really kill him?

This is the hardest pill to swallow. This is the reason not just the medical community but the world at large has agreed to this cooperative lie. Your anxiety is right. You can just die for no reason.

It’s not a conspiracy. It’s not something us doctors cooked up to control the masses. Everyone knows it on some level. We all know life is fragile and random. And we all know that those sudden bouts of dizziness and tightness in the chest and feelings of dread can’t just be benign. They’re warning us of something biological that we don’t yet understand. Why, in the name of God, would we evolve to experience panic for no reason?

“But there is a reason. Chronic anxiety.”

Do you really believe that? Do you really believe that the fix evolution gave us to dealing with stress over long periods is to imitate a heart attack instead of—I don’t know—maybe making us better at handling stress?

“But my doctor said…”

Exactly, your doctor said. And I’m here to tell you that your doctor is either wrong or lying to you. It’s not out of malicious intent. It’s to help people live their lives normally without a constant fear looming over them while we research this issue and try to understand it better and, hopefully, find a treatment for it.

I was one of the doctors that was wrong. I believed the lie myself. Or, I pushed the truth down somewhere inside me, choosing not to fully understand what the pathologist had tried to teach me in medical school. This has been mostly an essay so far, so let me try my hand at a bit of narrative to show you exactly what broke the spell for me, what woke me up from the illusion, so to speak.

Abby was a 26-year-old female. She was admitted to my hospital’s emergency department at 1:30 AM reporting shortness of breath, chills, shaking, and tachycardia. Since any symptoms that can be heart related are assumed to be so until proven otherwise, she was sent back to me right away. Her heart rate was 128. Not great for sitting down, but to be honest, that’s roughly what you’d experience on a light jog. Blood pressure was 145/90. Not great, but working in an ER, I’d seen much worse on people who walked out the next day.

“So, tell me what you do for work,” I said, as I applied the electrodes for an EKG to her skin. She hadn’t requested a female doctor and was perfectly comfortable being shirtless with me. She just wanted to find out what was wrong with her.

“I’m a paralegal,” she said quickly between breaths.

“I hear that’s hard work. Is that true?”

It may seem weird to have a casual conversation with someone in the throes of a panic attack, but casual conversation and focusing on simple familiar topics can help ease people through them. Also, though I’ve never read this in the medical literature, I believe talking can help regulate their breathing and return their CO2 levels back to normal.

“It can be. But I like it.” She laughed. Probably the cognitive dissonance of making a positive statement while feeling so terrible. It was good to release a little tension. I smiled at her and applied the last pad.

I turned on the machine and it began spewing out a paper readout of spikes and troughs telling me all about the state of Abby’s heart.

I said, “Alright, I’m going to make sure your heart is looking…ah there, yeah. I don’t see anything here that really concerns me. In fact, your heart is pretty strong. This is what I would expect to see in someone around 18 years old. Well, no, because their heart still has a little developing to go. But, this is peak performance here. Are you an athlete?”

“I like to run,” she said. With each passing second her breaths became farther apart.

“That’ll do it. I’ve always wanted to run a marathon. And I think I could physically, but it’s the time commitment. I don’t think I could fit the training into my schedule.”

“I’ve never done anything like that. I just do a few miles every day or two,” her voice sounded tired now. Almost drunk. That happens sometimes to people when they come down from the panic and the adrenaline goes but leaves the endorphins to make the person feel high.

I glanced at the pulse oximeter on her finger, about to stop the EKG, when I noticed her heart rate was now 60.

*That can’t be right.*

I grabbed her wrist and in the fifteen seconds it took me to check her pulse her heart rate had dropped to 40. I called for a nurse. I glanced at the readout from the EKG and saw that it had changed from one belonging to a young runner to one that would be a good candidate for a pacemaker.

“Hey, Abby, did you take anything before arriving at the hospital for your anxiety? Your heart rate’s a little low, so I’m going to give you a medication to—”

I read HR 30 on the pulse ox.

“Dear God…”

I don’t remember if I said that out loud or thought it. I hope I only thought it. But I don’t know if it would have changed anything. She already knew something was wrong. Her eyes widened and she reached for my hand. Her heart rate shot back to 60 briefly as she struggled to keep her head up before falling back onto the examination table.

The paper continued to print from the EKG, the spikes and troughs cutting sharply to a flat line that would stretch on forever if I didn’t turn the machine off.

I realized I was clutching her hand in mine. I let it go and it hung off the end of the table, limp. Dead.
