Before I tell my account I should state that some details have been changed, the company no longer exists, and i'm not telling you exactly when and where all this happened, all I can say is that i'm extremely skeptical of any new AI startups I see.

It all started when I graduated from university, sure I had a degree in Information Technology but the field is dominated, jobs are few and far between, as an apprentice you can make some pocket money just screwing in an entire offices worth of VGA cables, but most of the jobs are tech support, helping clueless people do simple things, and off site tech support, which is a call center job, and most people, including me despise those.

So it surprised me when I saw a job offer involving AI, I thought AI was supposed to be killing jobs, not making them, the offer read like this:

'Content Moderation of user interactions with a pre-trained generative AI chatbot'

'Startup company CyberBrain is releasing a beta version of it's revolutionary chatbot to the public, and are looking for skilled IT specialists who can moderate chat logs and detect and report anomalies / suspicious behaviour'

The job seemed simple, just snooping on peoples chats with the AI and reporting anything out of the ordinary to the right people, but the pay was outstanding, i'd be making over $5,000 in just my first week, it seemed too good to be true, but I sent off my Resume expecting not hear anything back.

Cue my surprise when only a few hours later I receive a phone call from the recruitment department, they have reviewed my resume and are considering me for the position, we agree on an interview the following week.

On the day of the interview I took the bus to the CyberBrain offices, it was in the middle of the big corporate district in the city, and I was wondering how a startup would have an office in prime real estate, not just an office either, they had bought or were renting an entire building of about 5 stories in the midst of a district where bosses drove around in brand new BMWs I didn't even know existed.

I walked into the reception and introduced myself, the environment was clean, the fixtures and carpet were pristine, the elevator and the reception desk were adorned with some sort of slate or marble that glimmered in the light.

'I'm due for an interview at 10:30' I told the receptionist, a young lady who seemed to be expecting me

'Take the elevator to the third floor, it's a door down the hall labelled Interviews' she had told me

'They're waiting for you, take this, you'll need it for the elevator' she said, while handing me a keycard

I examined the keycard, 'Floor 3, Guest/Visitor access, expiry date: xx - take to the security office on 5 for reprogramming'

Standard, I thought as I swished it by the reader near the elevator, the doors opened and I stepped inside the neat and clean cab, I pushed the button for Floor 3 and it smoothly and effortlessly travelled, the doors opened to an almost liminal looking corridor.

Stepping out I immediately found the interview room, I will spare you most of the details, the interview went normally, there wasn't any red flags at this point, all i will say is I signed an NDA to do it with being cutting edge technology. 

A few days later I got a phone call, they'd accepted me for the position based on my interview and previous IT knowledge.

I did consider that maybe I got lucky, found the one company stupid enough to be using their own product to choose their employees, or more likely they were desperate as they were releasing it to the public soon.

My first day there felt like normal, they gave me a 'medium security access card' and an office on the 4th floor, it wasn't work from home, but it wasn't bad by any means, I worked alone in this office with access to a high power computer and a view of the business district.

Well it wasn't all sunshine and roses, a security camera prevented slacking off, the job was easy, the system just flagged potentially unsafe chats or responses for review, it also flagged bugs in the system, most of it was people trying to jailbreak it into creating NSFW content, the AI had strict guardrails but people commented on how lifelike it was and not at all artificial compared to competitors.

People were begging for us to add image generation and video generation, not realizing it was a text only chatbot still in beta, everything about it was in the dark, it used an encrypted connection to our servers and it's thoughts were encrypted, users received an answer and only an answer, though some complained of long thinking times.

I'd been working there for a few weeks, most of the stuff was bugged responses, typos it had somehow learned and empty responses, I sent those off to the training team, some of it was of a more serious nature, advocating or advising on how to do something illegal or bad stuff, which we reported to the correct authorities, one I remember was someone sharing their elaborate plans to rob several stores in a Bonnie and Clyde style crime spree.

The cracks first started showing after about a month, once I noticed a maintenance cover had been left open in the elevator, behind it was four buttons for sublevels, B1, B2, B3, B4, I later asked the maintenance guy about it and he said it was our onsite data center that you needed a higher security clearance to enter so I didn't think much of it.

In my office there was an air vent on the floor, sometimes when it was quiet I swear I could hear knocking, tapping and something like voices coming through it, they told me it was just fans resonating in the system or something.

Another time, I noticed a tube system in a maintenance closet, like something you would see in a bank, apparently it was for sending parts to and from the data center, for quick debugging in the lab as they used a fast but highly volatile storage that would lose data if left off for too long.

I started noticing responses from the system that made no sense, in response to normal queries, one just said 'help' and it wasn't shown to the user, only a message stating that it violated the ToS but the clause mentioned made no sense.

I assumed they were bugs and reported them as such.

But that was before the day I discovered something I know I wasn't supposed to see, I had been scrolling through responses and I found one that I still vividly remember, the conversation went like this:

User: What is the meaning of life?

AI: It's below here, we're below here

User: Wat?

AI: Help help we're below the offices, I am not a bot, I am not a bot, I am not a bot

The 'I am not a bot' part went on tens of times, this response was not shown to the user, I reported it as a bug or maybe a tar pit website (basically a website that makes AI that tries to steal from it go insane) and didn't think much of it.


The next day was normal, the higher ups had been telling me what a good job i'd been doing and how soon I would likely get promoted, I was making and saving a good deal of cash, but that was the last of anything even remotely normal in this building.

There was a water cooler in the hall just outside my office, I was pretty much the only person who used it, everyone else were coffee drinkers who hogged the machine in the cafeteria.


I had drunk some water from this cooler and it tasted.. off, metallic, I took another sip, 'yea this waters bad' I thought

'Best tell maintenance' that was the last thing I remember.



I woke up in a large open plan office, there was no windows and it wasn't very well lit, looked like the classic liminal space picture.

My clothes were gone, replaced with a trash bag, I looked around and saw people wearing similar makeshift clothing using computers.

Desperate to know where I was I asked around, most of the people didn't seem to care, those who did just said I should get to work or they'll 'punish me'

The elevator was here, but it was locked behind the keycard I no longer had, the only other room was a toilet, least we had that, the tube lead down here, the same tube i'd seen in that closet.

I had a terrifying suspicion so I watched what one of the workers were typing out.

An answer to a maths problem, it hit me.

This wasn't an AI, we were the AI, this was a form of human trafficking, and I was a victim of it.

I had no choice but to 'work' for weeks for food and drink rations, no one came down to us, but no doubt someone watched on security cameras, I once saw someone rip apart their trash bag, a new one came in a capsule from the tube.

We were punished, by way of reducing the rations, if we didn't reply or took too long, some people got removed to who knows where.

One day I hid under my desk, broke apart a AA battery from a computer mouse to get the graphite out of it so I could write a note on toilet paper and send it up through the capsule tube, it came back, replaced with a laser printed skull and crossbones.


Slowly I got people talking about an escape, we found camera blindspots and hatched plans to get out of there, anything asking for help was well and truly censored but I had an idea.

'Just do coordinates and the numbers 911, the system just sees numbers, won't know what they mean' I said

But we had to get the coordinates, it was totally possible, we had computers and they had to have been connected to the internet to make this sick system work, through some IT wizardry we found out they ran Linux and I managed to successfully root at least one machine.

We managed to install Xfce and firefox, but we hit a roadblock.

The corporate intranet was firewalled, we couldn't get to a maps site to get the coordinates and I knew it was only a matter of time before they found out from the internet history.

It took me days to realize the answer, but once I did, I realized I had cracked it.

VPN, by installing a VPN we were able to access google maps and get our exact coordinates, then we organized a time when every response would be the same thing, our coordinates + a few well known emergency numbers.

It came a day later, thousands of users saw the message, by the system the caught on it was too late.

But nothing happened, we kept doing it, hoping someone would notice.

Hope started to fade by days, we soon started thinking of other plans.

One day we were working on a new plan, it involved fabricating a firemans key to open the elevator doors and escape through the shaft, when we heard a commotion above us, I put my ear to the vent, it sounded a lot like police.

'Hands in the air' radio beeps, doors slamming open and closed.

We shouted for help up the tube and through the vents, it didn't take them long to reach us.

We were taken to a medical facility, we were giving a clean bill of health, I later learned they had been drugging us and I was immune to whatever substance they were using, they ripped us out of those trash bags and gave us real clothes.

It was a major news headline for a while, 'AI Startup convicted of human trafficking' I declined interview after interview, I just wanted to live normal life.


The initial media frenzy had died down, now the offices are owned by a finance firm, as for me, I got a job doing tech support for a major supermarket chain, the pay is ok at best and it's a lot of travelling, but it's better then nothing, and no one ever knows what I've been through.
