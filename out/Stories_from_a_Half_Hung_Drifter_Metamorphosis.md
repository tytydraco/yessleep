Whilst driving southwest I decided to stop in Laurel, Mississippi. K and I were both exhausted and my wounds were hurting so we decided to sleep in a hotel.

While walking towards our room I heard the pained groans of what sounded to be a young human teen and the clattering sounds of insect.

I had K pick the lock of the door, as I pulled out my Dagger and hid it underneath my jacket. When the door opened I saw what looked to be mostly human, with tendrils, mandibles, and limbs of an insect.

I stabbed it between the eyes.

I then inspected the area finding torn clothes and a note, it read:

&#x200B;

I write this, shaking in fear, before I’m no longer myself.

I had been having dreams lately of this bug god calling to me, calling me "One of my chosen, the first". When I’d wake up, I’d feel off almost as if I wasn’t alone, and I’d notice things moved in my room. Just the other day my mom asked me why I was moving all of my stuff around in the middle of the night so I guess it's safe to assume I’m sleepwalking too. It honestly kinda scared me, as I write this and look back I know I should’ve been as terrified as I am now.

A few days later a friend warned me the school bully was looking for me. He then questioned why I would attempt to cyber bully him.

I’m not the type of person to be rude, I’m a typically shy guy. So when I heard what he said I gulped audibly. My buddy asked if it was really me, I guess from the look on my face he could realize I was fearful and he knew I didn’t do anything of the sort.

Later I was sitting in class when I heard a chair hit the ground, before I could even turn to see what occurred I was hit in the face; I could feel a warm liquid running down it as I stood. When I looked at my attacker I could see a single knuckle sticking out and bloody. I acted as if I was about to throw a haymaker only to throw a kick, the same way you would kick a soccer ball, straight to his groan. You could see by his face that he was gonna get up. However, I didn't let him get the chance, I reached forward and grabbed his hair, I could feel it between my fingers. I pulled him towards me while swinging my knee forward. I could hear a loud cracking sound as my knee collided with his nose. His eyes rolled back as blood spilled out like pouring water. It was clear he was out cold before he even hit the ground.

I’ve never been violent like that before, I looked at my own hands trembling before my teacher yelled at me… I ended up getting sent to the office.

Of course I got suspended but I only felt good about it. My mother was yelling at me the whole ride home about the fact I had a three week suspension. When I went to get out of the car my mom took my phone away.

I was given my class work and homework for all of my classes. I began going through it just to have it done. My mother and father later that night took turns beating me. I was always scared of my parents due to the abuse, but I knew it was going to get worse and it honestly horrified me.

The next morning when I awoke the areas I had been hit had turned green and hard. Anyways I continued, well finished, my work and I swear there were moments where my hands looked like that of a mantis arm.

My mother father continued to beat me for the next few nights however the pain from the beatings began to lessen until I couldn’t feel it at all. As the first two weeks went by I lost almost all feeling of touch and I stopped needing to breathe like normal, my clothes began to feel suffocating and my eyes turned green with massive black pupils.

Right before my suspension was over I fell into an almost hypnotic trance and I ate my own dog… When my parents got home I told them I let him outside and he got out. That was the worst beating I had received in my life, yet I felt nothing but anger. My fear of them was almost completely absolved.

My father, a smoker, noticed my non-reactiveness and decided to put a cigarette out on me. That’s when I had decided that was the last time I’d be beaten. I ended up killing my own parents in cold blood before running from home.

I was hungry, so I began to eat from trash and roadkill before being caught by a cop. I don't know what came over me. Everything I saw slowed down, when I lunged for the officer, I could see him fire his gun, I watched as he aimed and moved right before he finished pulling the trigger. I grabbed by the throat and lifted him up before slamming him on his head. as I heard the crack of his skull, no heard isn't the right word, I could feel the sound, I felt an even more overcoming hunger. I tore him open and ate of his flesh of the scalp and ate his brain out of his skull. After killing, and as forementioned feasting upon him, I stole his car and ran. By this point the skin around my wrists began to peel off revealing the fibers of muscle and whites of tendons below. A small hole sat in the center of each wrist, I found a medical mask in the officers car after tossing his carcass into the trunk of the vehicle.

I went into a dollar general and bought a long sleeve shirt to hide my wrists. I had to get out of dodge; so I left I went driving to a town a while away before ditching the vehicle and walking until I found a motel.

I used my dad's card and payed for a month in the motel, the only good thing he's done for me. A few days in the hotel I finally had another dream of the bug god, no that's not right, I had a dream of my god and he said "It's time, go forth and begin. You're the first and with you more shall arise, flesh of your flesh and blood of our blood. My Adam, and with you shall be your Eve." At that moment I awoke, I was forming a cocoon in the corner of the closet by spraying an almost web like fluid out of my wrists. I write this before I step into it. My destiny…

&#x200B;

The rest of it was covered in a green, blood-like substance, except for the last line.

&#x200B;

I’m lucky to have had this moment of clarity. Everything is fogging up again.

&#x200B;

I checked the closet to find the cocoon the note mentioned. At that point we decided to call Sword and explain the situation, but there wasn’t really much to explain, he was the first of his kind as far as anyone heard. I informed them of our location. Sword then notified us a truck was on its way to pick him up, I took a photo of the note before we were going to leave, I looked at his wallet, the kid was a highschooler. by his ID I could see he had just turned eighteen, at that point we, K and I, went to our room.
