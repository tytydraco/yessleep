I finally got a hold of Aunt Gigi. When I explained to her what happened, she went completely ballistic.

*“I told you to wear closed toe shoes!”*

“They were uncomfortable!” I snapped back. “But seriously, what the fuck is going on here?”

“It’s complicated.”

“Okay, well, tell me at least—how do I stop the itching?”

A sigh. “Go to the bathroom in the back. In the medicine cabinet, there’s a blue tube labeled *ALOE SALVE*.”

I walked down the back hallway that led to her office and the bathroom. This part of the store always creeped me out, even when I was a kid. A long, endless hallway shrouded in shadow, with no ceiling lights. I walked into the bathroom and swung open the mirrored cabinet.

*Wow. That… doesn’t look right.*

I’d expected orange bottles with pharmacy labels on them. Instead, the shelves were lined with glass bottles and vials. One bottle had what looked like feathers in it. Another held various colors of sand—cream, taupe, beige, pink. I riffled through them until I found the blue tube with a piece of masking tape stuck to it that read, in sloppy handwriting, *ALOE SAVE.*

“This one? With the masking tape and ‘salve’ misspelled?”

“… Yeah.”

Against my better judgement, I squeezed the tube. Green-colored paste shot out that smelled foul, like rotting vegetation in a bog. I rubbed it over my foot. It stung pleasantly, like mint.

“Okay. Now you’re going to tell me what’s going on,” I demanded, cradling the phone to my ear as I washed the gook off my hands.

“I can’t tell you,” Aunt Gigi replied. “You’re just going to have to trust me.”

“Uh, I don’t trust you, actually. Because you left your *nineteen year old niece with a rug that eats people.”*

“If you’d just followed my instructions, we wouldn’t have had a problem!”

“If you don’t tell me what’s going on, I’m telling Mom.”

Dead silence on the other end.

“Okay. I’ll be back in about an hour, and we can talk then. I promise.”

I sucked in a breath. “Fine.”

I ended the call and put the tube of gross swamp goop back in the medicine cabinet. Then I hobbled back out into the store.

In the few minutes I’d been in the bathroom, the weather had radically changed. The concrete apartment building was no longer bathed in summer sunlight; it was now flecked with rain. I couldn’t see the sky, but everything was much darker, and I imagined pitch-black stormclouds rolling in.

A sudden summer squall.

The rain drummed on the roof, suddenly intensifying, like a crescendo. A woman and her child hurried down the sidewalk, getting drenched. Water began to pool in the gutters. I was secretly relieved—at least the rain meant I wasn’t missing any fun.

I sat back behind the counter. The store was much darker, now that the storm had rolled in. I went around flicking on all the lights. The brass lighting fixtures overhead, and the two iron-wrought sconces on the wall, bathed the place in warm, golden light.

I paced again, staring at the glass display of *Precious Moments* figurines. Then past the painting, of the woman dressed in black, standing on the balcony of a lighthouse and looking down at the sea. *Maritime Widow,* read the piece of paper stuck onto the frame.

I walked back towards the desk, past the rocking chair, with the handwritten sign that read *DO NOT SIT HERE.*I’d assumed Aunt Gigi put the sign there because she didn’t want anyone breaking it. Now I wondered if there was another reason. Would the chair eat anybody who sat in it, just like the rug had engulfed my shoe?

The rain became a torrential downpour. The drumming on the roof sounded like thousands of tiny hands descending from the sky and punching the metal. I sat back down at the desk and pulled out my phone. *Hey, I almost got eaten by a rug today,* I texted Dawson. My thumb hovered over the send button—then I erased it.

*Screw him.*

Instead, I texted my best friend Kira the same sentence. She replied immediately:

*Wat??*

*U ok??*

*Should I come over???*

I smiled and texted her back, describing something weird going on at the thrift shop. As my fingers tapped the screen, the lights flickered overhead.

*Oh shit. Are we going to lose power?* I wondered.

I chewed my lip. That would suck. The one air conditioner stuffed in the window was on its last legs, but it did cool the place somewhat. It would be absolutely sweltering in here without it. Plus, I wasn’t a fan of the dark. *I think we might lose power,* I texted Kira.

*I’m coming over there. Was gonna go to the beach but cant with the rain.*

*Is it ok if I bring Elias??*

Elias. Kira’s older brother, who possessed that sexy-older-brother vibe. I’d had a crush on him when I was like 14, before I realized he was a total smartass and played video games all day. Well, who was I kidding—I still had a teeny-tiny crush on him. Man, what is it with the allure of friends’ older brothers? If I’d met him out in the wild, I never would’ve even taken a second look at him.

I rolled my eyes, smirking. *Yes, you can bring Smelly Elly,* I texted back.

*Looool stop calling him that.*

The lights flickered again. This time, they stayed suspended in a half-dim mode for several seconds, making an odd buzzing sound. Casting strange, brownish-gold light over everything.

*Ugh.*

The rain pulled back slightly, and then the heavens opened. Rain pelted on the roof, dripping down the windows in rivers. The ripped awning fluttered in the wind like it was fighting with a ghost.

And then—without warning—the lights went out.

The thrift store was *dark.* Really dark. The shop is much longer than it is wide, so the light from the windows didn’t even touch the back of the store. The furniture and other goods all became nondescript silhouettes, detailless. Like putty ready to be formed into monsters by my over-paranoid imagination. The fan in the AC slowly rattled to a stop.

*Fuck.*

*We lost power,* I texted Kira. I turned my phone’s flashlight on and got up, everything thrown into relief from the white light.

The white light swept over the furniture, the walls, the hardwood floor. But something—something looked different. I scanned the store more slowly this time, sweeping the flashlight across the store once more.

My heart plummeted.

The *Maritime Widow* painting.

There was only the lighthouse, and the sea.

The woman was gone.

*What the…*

I ran back over to the desk and grabbed the manual. I flipped through it, looking for *ENTITY #099,* the number that had been stuck to the painting.

Heart pounding, I began to read.

*Entity #099*

*Class V*

*Presentation: Entity #099 is an oil painting on canvas, measuring 48 inches wide and 32 inches tall. It depicts a woman\* wearing 19th century funeral dress, standing on the observation deck of a lighthouse. When the painting is inactive, her back is to the viewer. Despite the painting closely resembling 19th century impressionism, there are no visible brushstrokes, even under a microscope.*

*Safety Precautions: #099 is activated in darkness, when the light level drops below 50 lux. It is highly recommended that painting resides in a brightly-lit room at all times. A backup lighting system is a must.*

*When the light drops below 50 lux, the woman in the painting (Subentity #099-A, colloquially known as “The Widow”) will escape the painting. The escape time is estimated to be 12.5 seconds; if the light levels return to normal during this window, #099-A will not leave the painting \[see “Activation Times for Class V Entities,” 2013, Schneider et al.\]* 

*Recovery Procedures: While the Widow (#099-A) remains inside the painting, the painting cannot be destroyed. It is impervious to fire, sharp objects, and chemical damage. However, when she is outside the painting, Entity #099 can be destroyed by touching silver (at least 18/10 grade) to her skin.\*\**

*Origin: #099’s origin is unknown, as survivability is estimated to be under 10%.*

*\*Figure is only presumed to be a woman; exact gender is unknown.*

*\*\*#099-A does not have true skin, as the entity can pass through walls and other solid objects. For more information on solid passthrough (also known as guided molecular reformation), see Appendix E.*

I shut the manual and leapt out of the chair. I made my way towards the front of the store, flashlight sweeping across the room—

*No.*

She was standing there.

The woman from the painting.

Wearing a black dress that reached the floor, melting into the shadows. A lace veil completely obscured her face.

*Oh fuck oh fuck.*

I turned and sprinted down the hallway, into the office. I slammed the door shut and locked it, then dialed Aunt Gigi.

“We lost power,” I told her, breathless. “And… and the woman from the painting… she’s out.”

*“Shit,”* she hissed.

“The manual said you’re never supposed to have it in darkness! Didn’t you think to buy a generator or something?!”

“Okay. Um... the woman… she can’t go into the light. So get out of the store.”

“The manual didn’t say that.”

“I know from experience,” she replied, her voice grim.

“Okay, well anyway, it doesn’t matter. She’s standing between me and the store.” I paced around the office, picking up various things, searching for silver. “Is this fancy letter opener real silver?”

“No—wait—Nadia—the painting is worth thousands of dollars! You can’t destroy it!”

“So what, you prefer I *die?”*

“No! Just, get out of the store! I’ll be there in ten minutes—just—”

“So the letter opener *is* silver, right?”

“Yes. But please, don’t use it unless it’s a last resort.”

I ended the call. Holding the letter opener in front of me like a sword, I opened the door and stepped out into the hallway.

It was then that I realized—

I forgot to tell Kira not to come.

Kira and Elias were in the store. They were cowering behind the old, saggy sofa. Elias had a hand clapped over Kira’s mouth.

The Widow paced slowly in front of them. As if she were searching for them. *Could she see through the veil?* Holding my breath, I took a step towards her.

The old floorboards creaked underneath my feet.

The Widow’s veiled face snapped up.

And then she made a beeline for me.

She almost appeared to float, her body barely bobbing up and down with every step, the hem of her dress melting into the shadows on the floor. I was suddenly frozen, petrified, staring at her as she approached. As she got close, I could see her clearly, see through the chinks in her black lace veil—

She didn’t have a face.

It was just a pale blob of color, like the artist had forgotten to add details.

I lifted the letter opener, every muscle tensed.

I took a deep breath—

And plunged it into her chest.

Except—it didn’t go into her chest. She dodged in a split second, her body turning fuzzy, bleeding into the shadows. She straightened—and her gloved hand shot up to my neck.

The letter opener clattered to the floor. Dots fluttered into my vision, choking out all other thoughts. I stared at her bare, smooth, mannequin-like face beneath the black veil.

*This is not how I fucking die.*

Darkness crept through my vision until the rest of the thrift shop melted away, and all I could see was her awful, blank face. I clawed at her gloved hand, but her grip didn’t loosen.

*No…*

*Clink.*

The Widow turned around—

And then shattered to a million tiny pieces, like she was made of smoky black glass, pattering onto the ground.

I was staring face-to-face with Elias.

He was holding the letter opener, stabbing it into where her back was seconds before.

I gasped for breath, beginning to cough.

“What’s going on here?” he asked, without any of his usual smartassery. It scared me, to see him so serious.

“Honestly? I don’t know.”

Kira finally scrambled up, eyes wide. She made her way over to us on shaky legs. “What…” she croaked, then shook her head, as if talking at all was a horrible idea.

“I don’t know,” I replied.

“Your neck,” she whispered. “It looks awful.”

“Thanks.”

Seconds later, the door burst open, and Aunt Gigi ran in, panting. Her eyes glanced from me, to Elias, to Kira, to the shattered black glass on the floor, to the painting on the wall which was now simply a blank canvas.

Her mouth hung open in a silent O.

“You have a *lot* of explaining to do,” I said, crossing my arms at her.

Her lips pressed into a thin line.

“I suppose I [do.”](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)
