The forest made a copy of me. It wants the original dead.

I’ve always loved hiking in forests. They’re the only places where my mind feels at peace. 

There’s one close to my city I’ve wanted to explore for a while. It’s secluded, barely any trails or campsites, just tall pine trees.

On Friday morning, I drove to the nearest parking lot. There was a small path going between the trees, leading along the forest floor. 

There was dirt, moss, and pine needles beneath my feet. Every step felt like the forest was swallowing my footprints.

When I put up my tent that evening, dark clouds formed over my head. Soon, heavy raindrops poured down from the sky. 

When I lay down that night, it felt like my whole body was drowning in mud. 

My mind was drifting off to sleep when I heard a strange noise outside my tent. It sounded like a person trying to speak. Their voice was damp and thick.

I shone my flashlight; no shadows around the tent. I decided to open it and have a quick look around, but nothing was out there. 

I felt creeped out. I had heard strange sounds in the forest before, but this sounded too human, too real. I could barely sleep that night.

The rain banging on my tent woke me up the next morning. I quickly packed up my things, trying to make sure everything got as little wet as possible.

The sky poured all day. The mud was sticking hard to my shoes. The forest was dead silent. Only the sound of raindrops falling on the ground echoed through it.

I was walking back to my car when lightning struck the path I was on. The whole forest lit up with a flash of bright white light. 

I had to put my hand in front of my eyes. When I put it down, I saw mud in front of me, bubbling vigorously as if heated from below.

The mud started mushing together, slowly building height. It began to shape into a frame of legs, torso, and arms. 

Then an outline of a head with long hair hanging behind it formed. Something about that shape seemed familiar.

Another lightning strike, and the thing began to change color, its brown muddiness slowly turning into a pale skin-like tone. Nails slowly growing on the tips of its fingers. 

Two holes formed in the outline of its head where blue eyes slowly rolled in from the back. 

Then a nose, ears, and lips formed on it. The lips opened, mud fell out of them, and in its place a row of pearly white teeth showed. 

The creature then looked at me and flashed an unnaturally wide grin with its eyes piercing mine. My whole body was frozen, and my heart was pounding hard inside my chest. 

My knees were weak, my arms were shaking. There was a strange metallic taste in my mouth. 

I couldn’t take my eyes off it. The creature tried to speak. 

At first, it sounded like a few inaudible mumblings, but as more mud fell from its mouth, it turned into something resembling words. 

It sounded human, strange but human, like a person trying to speak with water in their mouth. I soon realized that the thing standing in front of me was me.

“Hi Sally,”  uttering my name in its damp, muddy voice.

The sound of that pierced through me and unfroze my body. 

I immediately turned around, threw my stuff on the ground, and started running away. 

My ears were ringing, my vision was blurred. 

I could hear the creature's feet splashing in the mud, getting closer and closer. 

Then I felt one of its hands gripping mine. I tried to wrestle out, but the creature was too strong. 

It threw me to the ground, mounted me, and put its hands on my neck. 

Its palms and fingers felt cold and wet. The creature smelled earthy, humid, and rotten like a swamp after a heavy rain. 

I tried to scramble out from under it, but the creature was too strong. 

My hand started frantically searching on the forest floor when it finally stumbled on what felt like a rock. 

I didn’t hesitate and struck it over the head.

It fell to the ground, and mud began to pour from the place I struck. It slowly began to bubble and clot like human blood.

I took off running again, sprinting through the forest. I found a small rock opening beneath one of the hills.

I’m hiding there right now. My heart is pounding, I can’t catch my breath, my whole body is shaking.

I can hear its voice. 

“*Sally…*”

That damp and muddy screech is getting closer.

Please, if anyone is near, call for help.

I can’t make a sound. If I speak, the creature will know exactly where I am.
