It’s the silence of the early morning drive that gets to you. The hum of the tires on asphalt becomes a mantra, the dashed white lines a hypnotic pulse leading you deeper into the dark.

I’ve been making this commute for three years now, a five-day-a-week pilgrimage from my sleepy town to a industrial park on the other side of the state line. The only way to avoid the soul-crushing traffic is to leave at an ungodly hour, so my days begin at 3:00 AM, in the absolute stillness of a world not yet awake.

My route takes me through the heart of the Appalachian foothills. It’s not a road for the faint of heart. Route 119 is a winding, two-lane serpent that coils through the mountains, all blind curves and sudden, steep drop-offs into thick, unforgiving forest. There are no streetlights out here. Your world is defined by the reach of your own headlights, a small, moving island of vision in a vast, dark sea.

It was on one of these drives, about a month ago, that I saw them for the first time.

The clock on my dashboard glowed 4:07 AM. A thick, milky fog had settled in the valleys, common for this time of year. It swirled in the beams of my headlights, reducing my world to a thirty-foot bubble of hazy light. I’d slowed to a crawl, my knuckles white on the steering wheel, navigating solely by the feel of the road and the faint reflection of the cat’s eyes. I was rounding a particularly sharp bend, the one locals call “The Scythe” for its vicious curve, when I saw movement ahead.

Figures. Walking in a single-file line along the narrow shoulder of the road.

My first feeling was a dull spike of annoyance. This was a known route for devout folks, especially around certain times of the year, making long pilgrimages on foot to a small chapel nestled deeper in the hills. I’d seen them before—families, church groups, their paths illuminated by flashlights and headlamps, often carrying crosses or icons. They were usually a welcome sign of life in the oppressive isolation.

But something felt off about this group immediately.

I slowed further, flicking on my hazard lights. The rhythmic click-clack was the only sound besides the engine’s purr. As I drew closer, the details solidified in the fog, and my annoyance began to curdle into a low, thrumming unease. They weren’t carrying any lights. No flashlights, no lanterns, not even a glow stick. They were walking in near-total darkness, in the middle of a fog bank, on a road with no shoulder. It was suicidal.

There were about a dozen of them, maybe more, their forms blurred by the mist. And they were all dressed in the same drab, colorless clothing. It wasn’t just grey; it was a flat, absorbent grey, like felt or thick wool, that seemed to swallow the light from my headlights rather than reflect it. No backpacks, no water bottles, none of the practical gear you’d expect from hikers. And crucially, no symbols. No crosses, no rosaries, no images of saints. Nothing that marked them as pilgrims on a holy journey. They were just… walkers.

Strange, I thought, but not my business. I just wanted to get past them. I hung back, waiting for a straightaway, but the road was a continuous snake of curves. Their pace was unnervingly steady, a metronomic, plodding step that never faltered, never sped up or slowed down. It was the pace of a machine, not a man.

After a few minutes of crawling behind them, I saw my chance—a slightly less severe curve. I swung out, pressed the accelerator, and passed them. As I did, I glanced to my left. Their faces were turned down, obscured by the fog and the deep shadows cast by the hoods or hats they seemed to be wearing. I felt a chill, unrelated to the morning cold, and was glad to leave them in my rearview mirror.

I drove on for another ten minutes, my heart rate slowly returning to normal. The fog was, if anything, getting thicker. I was descending into a lower valley, where the cold air pooled and created these impenetrable walls of white. I took a blind left-hand turn, and my blood went cold.

There they were.

The same single-file line. The same drab grey clothes. The same mechanical, plodding gait. They were maybe a hundred yards ahead of me, just appearing out of the fog as if they had materialized there.

No, I thought, a cold knot tightening in my stomach. That’s impossible. I passed them. I’ve been going forty miles an hour. There’s no way…

There were no side roads, no footpaths that joined the highway here. It was just the mountain on one side and a sheer drop on the other. Logic screamed that it had to be a different group, but every instinct in my body, every primal nerve, told me it was the same one.

Fear, cold and sharp, began to prickle at the base of my skull. I had no choice but to slow down again and trail behind them. My hands were slick with sweat on the wheel. The fog closed in, making the idea of passing a terrifying prospect. One wrong move, one oncoming truck I couldn’t see, and I’d be sent flying off the cliff. I was trapped in a metal cage, crawling behind a procession of silent, grey walkers.

The minutes stretched into an eternity. Five. Ten. Fifteen. They never broke formation, never once looked back. The only sound was my engine and the frantic thumping of my heart. Desperation began to override my fear. This was insane. I had to get past them.

I made a decision. I’d get closer, give a short, polite tap of the horn—not an angry blast, just a hey, I’m here—and maybe I could signal to the last one in line to let them know I needed to pass. It was a stupid plan, but it was the only one I had.

I inched my car forward, closing the gap until I was only ten feet behind the last figure. I took a deep breath and pressed the horn. A short, soft beep.

The effect was instantaneous.

The last figure in the line stopped walking.

Just… stopped. Its feet planted themselves on the gravel shoulder. The rest of the procession continued, their steady, plodding steps never breaking rhythm, disappearing two by two into the fog ahead.

My breath hitched. I had frozen him. Now was my chance. I slowed almost to a stop, ready to ease past him. As I drew alongside, I rolled down my passenger side window, the electric whir sounding obscenely loud in the silence.

“Hey,” I called out, my voice thin and reedy. “Sorry to bother you, but do you think I could just…”

The figure turned its head toward the car.

The interior light of my sedan spilled out, illuminating where its face should have been.

There was nothing there.

No eyes, no nose, no mouth. No skin. It wasn’t a mask. It was a void. A perfect, seamless, depthless patch of absolute blackness where its face ought to be. It was like looking into a hole that had been cut out of reality itself. The grey fabric of its hood simply ended, framing this… this nothing.

But the most horrifying part, the part that sent a jolt of pure, undiluted terror straight through my spine, was that I could feel it looking at me. There was a pressure, a focused, sentient attention emanating from that featureless void. It was studying me.

A sound, half-gasp, half-scream, ripped from my throat. I stomped on the accelerator. The tires screeched, fishtailing on the damp asphalt. I didn’t care about the curves, I didn’t care about the fog, I didn’t care if I drove off the goddamn mountain. Anything was better than being next to that… that thing for one more second.

I sped through the fog like a madman, my body trembling uncontrollably. Tears of pure panic blurred my vision. And then, up ahead, I saw them again. The line. The grey procession. And one of them was stepping into the road, an arm raised as if to flag me down.

I swerved into the oncoming lane, my heart in my mouth, expecting a collision that never came. I saw another one, and another. They were appearing every few miles, always the same, always with one of them trying to stop me. It was a gauntlet of faceless horrors.

I have no memory of most of that drive. It was a blur of terror and desperate survival instinct. I don’t know how long it was before I saw the blessed glow of sodium-vapor lights in the distance. A major crossroad. And there, parked at the junction, was a state trooper’s cruiser.

I swerved into the gravel lot next to it, my car skidding to a halt. I fell out of the driver’s seat, my legs unable to hold me. I must have been a sight—pale, shaking, hyperventilating.

The trooper, a tall man with a weary face, was out of his car in an instant. “Whoa there, son. You alright? You’re gonna hurt yourself.”

“People,” I gasped, pointing back down the road I’d come from. “On the road… walking… no faces…!”

The trooper and his partner, a younger woman who had emerged from the passenger side, exchanged a quick, unreadable glance. It wasn’t alarm. It was something else. Resignation.

“Easy now,” the first trooper said, his voice calm and steady. “Just breathe. What kind of people?”

I spilled the whole story, my words tumbling over each other. The grey clothes, the lack of lights, passing them only to find them ahead of me, the face… the horrible, black, empty face.

The troopers listened patiently. When I finished, the first one shook his head. “Son, we’ve been posted here since midnight. There hasn’t been a soul on that road coming from your direction. No pilgrims, no hikers, nobody.”

“But I saw them!” I insisted, my voice cracking. “Over and over!”

The female trooper knelt down next to me. Her voice was quieter. “What you’re describing… the grey clothes, the… the faces… A taxi driver said the same thing last week. Came through here in the same state you’re in.”

My blood ran cold. “So you believe me?”

The first trooper looked out towards the dark, fog-shrouded mouth of Route 119. “We believe you saw something,” he said carefully. “We just don’t know what it is. We’ve heard the stories. We call them the Grey Pilgrims. You’re not the first. Probably won’t be the last.”

I waited there with them until the sun began to bleach the eastern sky from black to a watery grey. The fog burned away, and the world looked normal again, solid and real. I drove the rest of the way to work in a daze.

I still have to make that commute. I have no choice. Every morning, as I approach The Scythe and the other treacherous curves, my heart hammers against my ribs. I drive with a white-knuckled grip, my eyes constantly scanning the shoulders of the road, dreading the sight of a silent, grey line emerging from the dark.

I haven’t seen them again.

Not yet.
