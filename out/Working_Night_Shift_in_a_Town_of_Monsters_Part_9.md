I stared out out into the inky blackness that awaited me outside, despite being closer to the window, I still couldn’t see my car which was parked only a few feet away from the store. Thankfully the screaming and cries for help finally ended, though I still heard something running around outside. I would hear the running steps of something, only for it to stop, then hear it running towards the store, stop, then run away. I knew if I stepped a single foot outside I would be it’s snack, but what could I do? I stood there, frozen in thought, Drill’s voice snapping me out of the indecision “you know, I do need a little help tonight dealing with the residents, and you do look like one. Go into the freezer and grab my coat, anything out there will think you’re me from behind, just be sure they don’t see your face.” I looked at him in disbelief, he knew what was out there? Before I could utter a word, Drill cut me off “Get the jacket, or don’t, you better be out there in 20 seconds or I’m going to throw you out there” Drill snarled. I ran into the back, grabbed the freezer jacket, grabbed the bucket/brush/squeegee , and made my way outside.

The store bell rung as if announcing my death as I backed my way outside, making sure whatever was out there couldn’t see my face. Sweat already began trailing down my back, the freezer jacket and hood was hot in the warm night air. My hairs stood up from the back of my neck as I heard it sprinting towards the store once again. Started soft and far away, but quickly became a loud stomping noise as it’s feet slammed against the cement of the gas station. I froze, hearing it sniff and scratch at the ground, with a loud yelp I heard it sprinting away, the loud stomping going silent.

With a bubble of air in my throat, I gasped for air, and started getting to work, I had four windows to clean, my arms shaking as I started cleaning the first. Every now and then I would hear the creature running back to me, sniffing me once again, and sprinting away from the gas station. As I finished the first window, I started hearing two pairs of feet sprinting towards me.

Hugging the glass closely to make sure they couldn’t see my face, their stomping was halted again, ending in sniffing, yelping, and sprinting away. I picked up the pace cleaning the windows, second one down and moving to the window covered in dirt. Before I could start, I heard it again, now four pairs of feet stomping towards me, this time I heard them going to the left and right of me, attempting to get a look at my face. I put my face against the glass, making sure the hood of the freezer jacket blocked their attempts to see me. Once again, I head them sniffing me up and down, feeling them sniff my legs, my arms, the top of head, only to yelp and run back stomping into the darkness.

I cleaned the third as buckets of sweat poured down my face, and moved to the fourth window, hearing them approach again. Now at least ten pairs of feet stomping against the floor, fingernails scraping against the cement. I could see one in the window’s reflection to the left, chilling my blood. Lacking any hair, it was extremely skinny, it’s bones visible beneath was seems to be almost translucent paper skin. It’s jaw was unhinged enough to easily fit a human head, showing rows of sharp teeth ready to tear up anything that enters it’s mouth. it’s hands were bloody dirty talons, each being at least four inches long, and it’s stomach were sunken in as if it had been starving for years. I put my face back to the window, making sure it couldn’t see me, or any of it’s buddies that were hidden in the darkness. Once again they sniffed me head to toe, yelping and screeching sprinting back into the night.

I wrapped up the last window, making sure that it was squeaky clean, I didn’t take a moment to admire my reflection in the glass. I started to make my way back to the store’s entrance when I heard the stomping of what I assumed to be a hoard of them sprinting towards the store. Looking up into the window’s reflection, I could barely make out one of their ghoulish faces in the darkness, though they all flashed large smiles at me. That’s when it hit me, if I could see it in the reflection, it could sure as hell see me, the jig was up.

I turned, discarding the bucket of water onto the nearest one, it seemingly burning from the touch of water. It writhed on the ground, delaying the fast approaching hoard of creatures, I started sprinting towards the entrance of the store. I opened the door, breathing in the gas station store aroma, only to feel a tight grip on my back. I felt their talons attempting to make their way into my back, my flesh burning as if they already did. They grabbed my arms and started pulling me back, back into the inky blackness I just escaped from. I watched in horror as Drill wave at me a goodbye, as if I was a friend heading out at the end of my shift.

Call it luck, call it skills from being grabbed as a kid, but I pushed my arms back, the sweat acting as lube, allowing their grips to go with the jacket as it fell off of me. I fell forward into the store, and crawled away from the entrance as the creatures shrieked and tore my jacket apart. They shoved the shredded jacket into their gullets, fighting over the scraps as if it was their last meal with loud shrieks and yelps.

My victory was cut short as Drill lifted me with his multiple arms and pinned me against the wall. “So not only did you damage the cash register, you also lost the company jacket. I think that’s worth your retinas right?” Drill said with a smile. He pulled out the rusty pliers again, making their way to my eyes.

“wait wait, let’s make a deal” I said, still struggling against Drill’s multiple arms. He hesitated, my left eye twitching from the rusty pliers sitting only a mere millimeters from my eye. “what’s the deal, what can you offer me that’s worth your retinas?” “How about you keep my pay at the end of day to pay for the jacket? You were going to pay me right” I said frantically, praying that he’d accept the deal. One of Drill’s arm scratched his head, only for the store bell to ring, someone entered the store.

What entered was a normal looking human, wearing a blue polo shirt and khakis. He had long brown hair, red eyes, and casually walked as if he was just out picking up a case of beer. Drill let go of me immediately, pulling me up and pushing me towards the counter. “That’s a resident, we’ll pick this up later, be friendly, and DON’T piss him off” Drill whispered angrily at me.

He rushed towards the employees only door as I stood in silence and shock. I watched the resident walk around the store, looking at merchandise. Taking the opportunity I returned behind the counter, this may be my only chance to talk to a “resident” without it attacking me, though just what do I ask a monster that can wander around safe outside with those starving creatures? I shuddered, my back still feeling as if the creature’s talons did make it’s way into me.

The resident approached the counter, holding some sort of jerky in a bag, looking up to me, he flashed a mouth filled with broken teeth. “Why hello there, do I know you from somewhere” he asked, his eyes beginning to glow a deep red
