While cleaning out the attic, I found this old, leather-bound journal tucked behind a broken lamp and some boxes of Christmas junk. It was thick, the cover cracked and stiff like it hadn’t been touched in years. I figured it was some old diary from whoever lived here before us.

But it had my name on the inside cover.

Not “To John” or “Property of John,” just: John, handwritten in this weird, jagged cursive. It looked like it was written with one of those fountain pens, all scratchy and faded.

I flipped through it, kinda expecting nothing but the first entry stopped me cold.

“December 13, 2022: Cody collapses near the porch. Don’t wait. Take him to the vet.”

Cody’s my dog. And yeah, he did collapse last year, exactly on that date. I didn’t post about it. I didn’t even text anyone that night. It was just me, freaking out, crying on the phone with the vet while my mom sped home from work.

I remember how scared I was. I really thought he might die. Seeing it written out like that with the exact date, was like getting punched in the stomach.

I checked the handwriting. Same across every entry. Like it was written by one person, long before anything happened.

I kept reading.

“March 18, 2023: You’ll break your wrist at the skatepark. Wear the pads this time.”

That also happened. I still have the scar which is thin, pale, just above my thumb. It’s stupid, I know but it felt like the journal was trying to warn me. Not just record stuff but actually help me avoid it. But I didn’t read it back then. I only found it now.

The next page had a future date.

“April 4, 2025: They’ll find the bones in the woods.”

I live near this small patch of forest, not some Blair Witch stuff, just your basic trees and trash kinda woods. Still, that line? It hit weird. Who’s “they”? What bones? I suddenly felt like I knew less about my neighborhood than I thought.

I turned the page.

“April 6, 2025: He’ll be in the window again. Don’t blink.”

That one really messed me up.

Two weeks ago, I thought I saw someone. Just for a second, a tall figure, motionless, outside my bedroom window. It was late and I figured it was shadows, maybe a reflection. But I didn’t sleep right for days.

And now this damn journal brings it up like it knew.

I kept reading, hoping it would start to make sense or that maybe I’d find a signature, a scribble, anything to prove it was a prank or someone messing with me.

Instead, I flipped to the back. There was only one more message, scrawled across the last page in huge, rushed letters:

“STOP READING OR IT STARTS.”

No date. Just that.

I slammed it shut. I even threw it in a drawer and tried to forget about it. But tonight when I got home from school, the drawer was open.

The journal was on my bed.

And it was open to a brand new entry.
