I woke up with a cold sweat. I looked at the clock that was placed on my nightstand: **3:03 AM**.

The air in my room felt heavier than usual—cold, almost damp, like the windows had been left open to the night. But they hadn’t. I was sure of it. The silence around me was thick and unnatural, as if the world outside had paused.

I felt a dryness in my throat, so I got up to grab a glass of water. Still half-asleep, I stumbled my way forward, blindly tracing the wall with my fingertips, searching for the light switch. The hallway beyond my door felt impossibly dark—like it wasn’t just night, but something *else* was pressing in from the edges.

I finally found the switch and flicked it on.

The sudden light stung my eyes, forcing them shut for a moment. When I opened them again, I scanned the room, squinting past the afterimage still lingering in my vision. My room looked untouched. Normal, at first glance. Too normal.

Then my gaze drifted upward—and my blood ran cold.

There was a note taped to the ceiling, right above where I’d been sleeping. The paper was slightly wrinkled, stained in one corner. Its presence alone was enough to make my skin crawl. On it, in jagged, uneven handwriting, were five simple words:

**"Don't look at the mirror."**

I froze. My breath caught in my chest.

I didn’t write that. I *know* I didn’t. And I live alone—no one else has a key to my place. No one should’ve been able to get in.

The paper seemed to hum with warning. A part of me wanted to tear it down and pretend I’d never seen it, but I couldn’t move. I stood there, rooted to the spot, my mind spinning in quiet panic. Maybe it was a prank? A dream? I rubbed my eyes hard, heart pounding.

Still there.

It hadn’t changed. It hadn’t disappeared. It just... waited.

I swallowed hard. “H-Hello?” I called out, my voice cracking in the heavy silence.

Nothing.

I wasn’t sure what I expected to happen. It’s not like anyone would suddenly appear. And yet, the silence after that single word felt *wrong*, like it had swallowed the sound too fast, like something was listening.

The words echoed over and over in my head.

**Don't look at the mirror.**  
**Don’t look. Don’t—**

I turned my head anyway.

There it was—my makeup table, tucked into the corner of the room, its mirror catching the light.

At first, all I saw was my reflection: wide eyes, pale skin, mouth slightly open in fear. But then I saw it—writing, smeared across the glass, in thick, red strokes that looked fresh, like they were still wet.

**“You shouldn't have looked.”**

The letters dripped slowly, almost deliberately, as though something unseen had only just finished writing them.

I stepped back, bumping into my nightstand. My knees felt weak.

Then I heard it.

The doorknob.

It rattled once—soft, but sharp enough to freeze my blood. Then again, more insistent. Like someone was jiggling it, testing it. Or worse—trying to come in.

I stared at the mirror. The writing had begun to blur. But behind the smears, in the corner of the reflection—

Something was standing by the door.

And it was waiting.
