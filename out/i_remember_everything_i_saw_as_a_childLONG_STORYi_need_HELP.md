*MY POV*


okay so maybe you ve heard those stories where people also specify how "kids" generally see more unusual things,i could call them "paranormal",than adults do.i honestly dont know why,but i can agree 100%.


many odd things happened to me along my childhood years,and i finally found a place where i can share my experiences.

okay so first of all,i ve always had a small obsession with horror movies,basically the entire horror industry(also the spiritual realm,i practiced alot of spiritual things)
was my favorite of them all.i dont know if watching too many movies,reading too many stories,had something to do with my visions but if somebody knows,i d be happy to hear.


*BEGGINING*
1.
okay so i never actually felt scared by any movie,i just considered them interesting,controversial paranormal,horror,spiritual things,always made me feel really curious.
but i wanna say that ever since i was 6,and my parents divorced,and so i needed to move in another apartment(rent ofc),i could NEVER sleep as peacefully as i used to do.



i could never sleep without my mom
and till this day,i still feel the same fear.its always like i m being watched.
first,i remember i was 6 as i already mentioned,my step father's family used to have some ceramic dolls,which i believed were creepy,but my step cousins begged me to play with them so i had no choice,or i d get grounded by my mom.



i remember we were sorting out the 
christmas decorations,and also playing with the dolls meanwhile.i felt like the dolls watched my every move,and i was as quiet as possible,this making my cousins wonder why am i acting like that.




anyways,my grandma called them asking for help to finish baking some cookies.and i was left ALL ALONE surrounded by my absolute nightmare(remember,movies and other things never gave me such chills)
and immediatly after they left,there was so much silence,that i couldn't even seem to hear the christmas carols my TV sang.




then my eyes saw the most horrific thing for a 6 year old,the dolls were actually watching me,they moved towards me,and i ran away to the kitchen,almost crying,worrying everyone,but no one believed me,blaming it on the fact that i was watching too many movies.
i am sure and i can 100% remember what i ve seen.



ever since then i couldn't even sleep with the doll my mom used to buy me so i could sleep hugging them instead of her,i grew up alone in my house almost everynight because they both used to work at night.
i always slept with the blanket over my head,even tho i couldn't breathe and i was always sweating,i felt more secure,because without it as i said,i felt watched.


2.
for the second experience,i have something pretty similar,so i ll keep it short.
i was in my room with my mom,and i just
got home from school,i was really sleepy and ready to take a nap.
and right before closing my eyes,just after my mom left the room,i was all alone again.
i had a baby toy,on top of a closet that was facing my bed.


as you may have already guessed the baby moved.
i couldnt sleep,i started crying and my mom worried once again.
anyways.
from then till now,i always feel watched at night.



and i feel some kind of energies around me whenever i m alone,and in general whenever i talk about them or even get a thought,it feels like that feeling when you know you got all eyes over you.
i tried purifying my room,i tried everything,protection spells,but i just cant seem to get rid of this feeling.
i always close my closets when i realise they re open,just because i feel like there are more eyes.



i bought sleep eye masks.they make me feel a bit more safe,and recently i started sleeping without being fully covered in thick blankets.
also i see many things moving in the corner of my eyes.things such as shadows,auras,or i just feel shivers down the spine.
help?.
