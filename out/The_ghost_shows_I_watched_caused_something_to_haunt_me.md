This occurred a couple years ago, I was a kid at the time. And was obsessed with those ghost shows. Just something about Spirits existing and doing whatever they do was something fascinating.

Well my family use to live in an apartment and never once had a fever experienced any sort of ghost like actives, besides in my dreams/nightmares but that wasn't in the waking world.

Well we soon moved to a house, it was an old house though it didn't look old. It had its problems, but that's beside the point.

Everything was fine the first few years, though I started seeing a black figure in the corner of my vision. Always peeking out from around corners, it had the silhouette of a person, though I'd only see the top half of it.

It had no face, no sort of feature that made it seem human despite the silhouette.

And I only saw it when I was alone in a room, and if I looked where it was, it would be gone. And I only ever saw it inside the house, it was honestly freaky at first seeing something watching me.

But I stopped caring about it, I just thought it was like having some sort of company. Well the black figure wouldn't be the only thing that would watch me.

I actually stopped seeing the black figure at some point, and it was night when I saw it.

I was just laying in bed watching TV since I had one in my room, I have trouble sleeping without light and some sort of sound. Well at some point, I noticed 3 white figures wrap around my door frame.

And half of a white face appears from the door frame, it had a face if I remember correctly. Well I had just glanced at it, thinking nothing of it.

I honestly thought it was one of my parents checking up on me, since they used to do that. To make sure I was in bed during quiet time or wasn't still awake past my bedtime.

Well I looked back, and it was gone. I only realized after looking again that it wasn't my parents, if it was they would still be there and the thing had no hair. 

I ended up staring at the door for a little longer, expecting to see it again. But I never saw it again after that.

Well soon after that, I was once again laying in my bed. Watching TV, when I heard in the room next to me. In the living room, I heard a little girl gasp.

I immediately muted the TV and had just laid there for a few moments before getting up out of bed and going into the living room.

There was no one, and it wasn't from the TV since the gasp was loud and my TV volume was already very low. And I have no little or sister at all. I did have older sisters but they don't live with us and they weren't even here anyway.

And it couldn't have been the TV in the living room since it was off, I was truly creeped out and just went back to my room and tried to sleep it off.

And my last final experience was when I had been staying up late watching YouTube.

It was probably near midnight, actually all but the first one happened near midnight.

Anyway, I was just watching a video. I don't remember what, but there was suddenly a voice right in my ear saying something. I had flinched and ripped my earbud out, staring at my closet since the voice was in my left.

I was half-deaf in that ear due to a traumatic experience that happened, I won't go into detail but I had gone deaf but gained back hearing. And because I was half deaf in that ear, everything was muffled.

So someone had to be right next to my ear for it to be loud, and I had a earbud in and everything was super muffled.

Anyway I had stared at my closet expecting to see someone, but there was no one. I even played the video back to see if it was from the video. But it wasn't, I immediately went to sleep after that.

I didn't stay up late for a few weeks, I think I forgot hence why I stayed up late again.

And once again, in the same ear. Someone said something, and I did the same as last time. Though instead of going straight to sleep, I tried to remember what was said in my ear. But I couldn't think of what they said, but I ended up remembering the first time it happened.

I realized that neither voice I heard sounded the same, I don't know how to explain what they sounded like.

But the second one sounded similar to my grandpa, he had unfortunately passed recently. And while he rarely talked, I could still remember his voice. There was no possible way someone could try to imitate his voice since there were specific qualities to it. And the voice sounded so similar.

I honestly thought that it was my grandpa or something, it was the only reasonable explanation for why they sounded so similar.

I also had never bothered asking my family if they experienced any of the sort, since even in conversation no one ever mentioned something weird that happened. So I didn't say anything about it, since it seemed like only I was experiencing this stuff. And it must've been due to the fact that before these hauntings started to happen, at least one other person watched it as well.

But after only I was watching, that was when it started to happen.

But after that final experience, I never experienced it again. I had stopped watching ghost stories since they honestly made me really paranoid and I would sometimes "see things" such as balls of light and shadows as well as see those "people" and hear those "voices".

It had become too much for me and my anxiety couldn't take it any longer so I stopped. And the ghost experiences/hauntings stopped as well... I'm not sure if they were connected, but it seemed like I was only experiencing this stuff due to those shows.

Though it doesn't exactly make sense since I never experienced it in the apartment even though I watched it then... I can only guess it was because. The house was very old unlike the apartment, I don't believe the apartment was that old. And I only started becoming paranoid soon after getting into the new house

I'm honestly not convinced myself, but it's the only explanation I have.
