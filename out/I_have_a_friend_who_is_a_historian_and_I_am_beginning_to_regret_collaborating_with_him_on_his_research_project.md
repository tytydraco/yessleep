If you are reading this, I hope you won't experience the same thing as my friend, and at the same time, I apologize to all mankind.


This happened half a year ago. At that time, my folklore research had not progressed. It was probably because the topic I was studying was relatively unpopular. My wife half-jokingly threatened that if I didn't get results next year and was expelled from the university, she would divorce me.


However, I really just couldn't come out a topic to write about. When I was really about to collapse,old friend of mine in Beijing Emailed me. He said that a pit was found on the mountain in my hometown. According to people who had gone down before, there seemed to be traces of sacrifices underneath.


If you want to know, I am Chinese American and my hometown is Zhejiang. I work in a university and go back to my hometown about twice a year. My mother still lives in a villa in the countryside there. She had nothing to do after retire, so she simply opened a hotel, and now she earns more than me.


I digressed.Anyway you see, the topic that friend was going to do was near my mother's hometown, and it could prevent me from being expelled because I couldn't write an essay.This is really a good coincidence.


So I went back. There is indeed a mountain near my mother's hometown, It is said that they wanted to develop tourismï¼Œhowever which has been abandoned for several years. But since it is said that the ancestors left traces of primitive beliefs on it, it is as attractive to people like us as delicious meat.


My mother said when I was a child that the god on the mountain was called Ertuo, because her mother said so, and the old people in other villages also called it that. I didn't pay attention to it when I was a child. 


Now I think it's very strange, because if it is really the god we believe in for generations, there will be some records. We were strictly forbidden to go up the mountain when we were young. The specific reason is unknown, but I think it may be just because it is unsafe for children to go up the mountain.


My friend and I looked up Ertuo, which means pig and sacrificial offering in ancient Chinese, which is also very strange.


What kind of god Ertuo is is debatable, because as I said before, there are actually not many records of it. There is no record of its performing miracles, but it is said that this mountain was built for it.


That day we were going to go up the mountain. Although generally speaking, my wife would be my assistant if I didn't have an assistant, but that day my wife didn't want to go. She said, her silver cross was brsaid last night, so she didn't want to go.

She and her parents are Christians, and she had made a lot of psychological preparations before marrying me. So I don't blame her. My friend and I continued to climb the mountain, and the pit was surprisingly intact.
We spent half an hour tying knots and preparing.


After going down, there was a passage below as they said, with a stone door at the end. There were some relics of incense ash at the door. Everything here was made very roughly, and there were no murals. It might be too old to have one. Although this structure is strange, we have seen it several times, because for some primitive beliefs in Asia and America, God is not in the sky, but in the underground. My friend wrote an article about this a few years ago, but it's too long to paste here.


We touched the stone with gloves on. It was a very ordinary material, nothing special. We struggled for a long time whether to continue walking, and finally decided to go deeper by him, and I watched at the door. I still regret this decision.


About half an hour, no, it felt like two hours down there. I heard him scream, and I ran over quickly. As I was running, I noticed something strange. It was so quiet that I couldn't even hear my breathing. I had to resist the urge to pee in my pants and find my friend. When I found my friend, he only said one sentence, "We were all wrong, we were all wrong," but there was even no echo to his words. I carried him down the mountain because his legs were so weak.


As we were going down the mountain, he kept saying, "You know, I saw it, it has fifty eyes, countless muscles and blood vessels, because I could only see a part of it, so I said countless." I can only blame it on hallucinations. After all, it is impossible for such a big thing to disappear the moment I rushed over. I didn't dare to look at the road because I was afraid that the road under my feet would also become a blood vessel.


My friend went back to Beijing the next day. He said he wanted to see his wife and son for the last time. I don't know why. I only know that he committed suicide three months ago. By then I had written a beautiful paper, but of course I had to delete the outrageous parts of my experience with him. My wife was pregnant, so his death seemed to wake me up from a drtime.


He jumped to his death, and he sent me an email before he died.


I learned that he had been seeing hallucinations since he went back, and they were getting worse. I actually thought it was just his mental breakdown. For example, he told me that there was a creature in the world that looked like a black ball of flesh but had hair, and he began to notice that other people couldn't see it.


What scared me was that he called it is the original appearance of the world in his email. According to his theory, as we evolved, we acquired cognitive filters. So every time we looked up at the stars, we didn't see the original appearance of the stars.

 His wife didn't want to talk to me, but I asked anyway, so did he have hallucinations before he died?

She told me yes, and auditory hallucinations. He said the songs he could hear were not in the language we knew. I asked him to take medicine, but it didn't work. 

I guess she didn't want to send her husband to a mental hospital, so she locked him in the house. She thought that installing iron bars on the windows would be fine.

Back to what I am saying what scared me was that he said in the email that the god was just passing by. He said that maybe it had been sleeping all the time. For mortals, we even need to make sacrifices every year to confirm whether he was awake, until time was too long and we had forgotten it.
 But for it, 2000 years was just a yawn. So, maybe he didn't intend to damage my friend's cognitive filter. After all, we are just one of 7 billion humans. it just glanced at him. Just like in my hometown dialect, tsor-son still means beasts and animals.

You see, we are actually no different from pigs and sheep from the perspective of the four-dimensional world. We stood up on two feet, learned complex calls, and chose intelligence in the evolutionary path. These choices are like cows producing milk or meat in the four-dimensional worfeet.

This incident made me panic and anxious. I even quarreled with my wife about the fact that God is underground, because I think that if the real God is underground, Jesus who was resurrected from underground is not himself. Afterwards, I regretted why I said that. A few days later, I found that he had sent me a scheduled email.

It was a new address. It is located near my current university. He said it belonged to a primitive tribe that has disappeared, but the structure is the same as the passage I saw in my hometown. I don't know when he took the pictures there. I went to Google and found nothing about those pictures.


If I want as he wished, I can actually ask a few students from the school to accompany me to confirm that it really looks like that, so that there is a certain probability that more than just me will be watching. Yes, I am a human being, so I am very selfish and don't want to bear this alone.


But then I thought, what's the point, if I do this, I will only add a few crazy people to this world with hundreds of millions of people.


I posted here because I finally thought that those gods may not need me to really open the door, they just need time to wake up, and what I did in my hometown accidentally woke up one of them. Maybe like dominoes, they will wake up one by one.

Just like Pandora's box, no matter where I go, I will be watched by their eyes one day.
Maybe not only me, but also all the humans who exist now.
