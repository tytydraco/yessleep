Placing the phone to my ear and not knowing for certain what to expect I managed a meek,

“Hello?”

A voice on the other end responded, they sounded very young, likely a child.

“Hello, is this 911? We need help, we got in a big car accident and mommy and daddy are not moving, I think they are really hurt, please help.” My heart sank, I started to panic I did not know if this was really happening or was going to happen like the other call. Whatever the case this kid’s parents were seriously injured or worse. I couldn't exactly call 911 myself and tell them that something bad somewhere was going to happen. I resolved to get as much information from the terrified child on the phone as possible. Maybe then I could do something about it, whatever that might be.

I heard crying on the line and I spoke slowly and clearly to try and reassure the poor thing that help would arrive, just not in the way she likely expected.

“I know this is scary but I promise I am going to try and help. What is your name and your parents' names.” The crying abated slightly and the trembling reply was,

“Chloe, my name is Chloe. My parents are Richard and Abigail.”

“That is great Chloe, thank you and what is your last name?”

“It’s Keller.” I was grateful she was old enough to know their family surname.

“Thank you, Chloe, can you tell me what happened? How did your mommy and daddy get hurt? What happened with the car accident did your car hit something? Or did someone hit your family's car?”

“We were just driving down the road and we were waiting at a red light and as soon as it turned green and we started going again a silver car hit us on the side and knocked our car over and it sped off.” I heard more crying and I tried to speed up the questioning without pressuring her, I didn't know how long I had.

“Do you know what type of car your family has? What color of car is it and what is the brand name on the back.” There was brief hesitation and then she spoke again,

“It is a red car; I think the label says it is a toy something, toy ta. I don’t know anything else that is just what the label says.” Red Toyota was something to go on at least, though I had wished I had the model as well. I did not bother asking for the plate number, I doubted she would know or be able to check that.

“Thank you, Chloe you are being so brave. Now can you see where you are? Are you able to see any road signs to help find where you and your family are?” I hoped she was able to see something to help find them, I had a terrible feeling that if this was somewhere rural, I might not be able to find wherever it was happening.

“I think I see a sign; I can't get out of the car I am stuck; it is getting hard to see there is smoke everywhere. I think I can see a sign by the light we were passing it says Bishpop or Bishop or something I can't tell from here, please it is getting hard to breathe in here.”

I was dreading the implication of what she said last. If there was a fire and she was stuck in that vehicle and no one was around to help she would not have much time.

“Okay, that is great, can you see another sign or anything else that can help locate you and your mommy and daddy?” She started to speak again but went into a coughing fit that lasted for several seconds. She managed to start again,

“I don’t see another street sign, but there is a bus stop or something near the road I think I see a number eighteen on it. I think..... oh no help! The car is on fire now, help...... please..........Help.....” Static assaulted my eardrums as I lowered the phone in an anxiety fueled stupor. The phone was dead again of course, no indication it had just answered a call from a terrified little girl in the future. I had to do something; I had no idea if it was really going to happen twice, I would not take any chances though. I hoped that the call came from within the city limits otherwise it could be anywhere and the chance of finding the right street and getting there on time tomorrow was near impossible.

I looked up the municipal bus routes and tried to find a bus stop or route marked eighteen. With a little map-work I was able to locate it and sure enough it was right near the street light and intersection of Bishop Street and Mullen Ave. I had my location, or so I thought. Now I just needed to know when it was going to happen. I realized I forgot to ask what time it was when I was asking for details. I checked the phone just in case it had a time stamp from the call but it would not display anything. My hunch was that since the call yesterday came later in the evening and the actual event occurred at a similar time of night, that the emergencies that correspond to the calls occurred at the same time, just on the subsequent day. I did not want to risk it in case I was wrong so I resolved to take the next day off of work and get to that intersection and go on a stakeout and wait.

I got there at around six in the morning and parked on the curb, near the bus stop but not blocking it. It was going to be a long day, but I tried to remain alert and vigilant. As I had expected nothing happened in the morning or afternoon. I was about to conclude my theory as correct and expect the accident to occur near ten o’clock in the evening based on the time of the previous call. It was four forty-two in the afternoon and I was about to step out of the car to find a nearby public restroom, since I had been sitting there for so long. Suddenly the phone sprang to life with that eerie chime. I looked at the road frantically for a red Toyota. The phone kept ringing and I realized it might not be related to this instance, it might be a different emergency call. I answered and I heard a new desperate voice begging for help.

“Hello, 911? My name is Stacy Thomas I am at the rest stop on exit 112 and we need ambulance and police here right now! A woman has been assaulted and she is in bad shape I think she is still alive but I don’t know, please send someone!”

It was another one, I had to get more information.

“Alright Miss Thomas did you see anything happen or did you just find this woman?”

“I was driving on the interstate and stopped to use the restroom. When I got to the woman's room there was an out of order sign in front but I heard a cry for help and found a woman who was battered and barely conscious inside. I don’t know what happened but we need help here now!” I considered how I could ask for more details without sounding strange and upsetting the woman on the phone.

“Alright I promise help will arrive. Would you please tell me if the woman has an ID on her to identify. Also, if she has any keys on her would you be able to tell what car she has parked there, if it is still there?” There was an audible hesitation and I figured she was considering the odd question.

“Isn't that something the police can do when they get here? We need help now she is barely holding on; this is a medical emergency as well; can’t the police investigate?”

It was a fair question and I could tell she was getting impatient so I was considering how to rephrase it to emphasize the importance of the detail when to my shock and horror I heard the audible static that signaled the end of the divining phone call.

“Hello? Hell....O.....Are.....Still.....There....” Five more seconds of loud static and the phone was dead. I wrote down all of the details I had for that call; they would have to do. I figured at least I had a location and a general time, though the call was after it happened so I would have to get there early enough to try and stop it.

I wrote down my game plan for tomorrow in my notebook. After my deliberation I noticed, it was starting to get dark outside and I had to focus on the accident that was going to happen that day. One emergency at a time, I figured.

It was getting closer to ten and I was on high alert. I still did not know what I was going to do to stop the accident. When it was just a few minutes before ten I got out of my car and walked up to the light. I was just going to have to get their attention when I saw them and hopefully stop them from crossing at the fateful moment. Sure enough, just a few minutes after ten, a red Toyota Corolla was heading towards the light and came to a stop. I looked in and saw a man driving the car with a woman in the passenger's seat and a child in the back seat. I tried to flag them down but they may have thought I was a pan handler and the father ignored my attempts at getting their attention. My heart was racing, the light was about to change to green and I knew in my gut it was going to happen. I decided to do something crazy and I leaped into the road directly blocking the car from going any further.

The father scowled and started honking the horn at me and the mother had a concerned, almost pitying look on her face. I realized I probably looked crazy to them but I had to try and stop them from going at just that moment. I looked behind me and the light turned green. Nothing happened and when I did not see a speeding car immediately, I started to doubt myself. The father looked angry now and was unbuckling his seat-belt, probably to get out and throw me off of the road. He never got the chance; I felt the air pressure and wind blast from a speeding car behind me and a load crash and strangled scream rang out.

I looked behind and a silver sedan was speeding away from the intersection, trailing blood in its wake. I did not know what it was, but something seemed familiar about that car. I realized in sudden horror that I had seen it before! It was the young couple's car from the night before, it had been stolen and the carjacker was still in possession of it.

Before I could make sense of the horrible connection, I realized that despite saving the family in the car, someone else had not been so lucky. A cyclist had been crossing the road at the same time and was apparently struck by the speeding car instead of the family. I was stunned by the damage that had been done. The man on the bike was torn up and was very likely dead already. I could not process what I was seeing but I heard a voice shouting in the dim periphery of my senses.

“Richard call 911 we need help, someone hit that man!” Chloe’s parents stepped out of the car and told her to stay inside. She regarded me as I back away and I saw the couple near the body of the biker calling the real emergency services.

I backed up with a confused mix of emotions. I had saved the young family but it had led to that cyclist being stuck instead. As I stood there in a daze my phone vibrated and I noticed I had another message. I steadied my trembling hands and read it,

“Very utilitarian of you. You saved three by sacrificing one. You are doing better, but not quite there.  Keep it up and don’t disappoint me –M"

I had no idea how to feel, I thought I could save them and I did, but at the cost of someone else. I could not figure out why this was happening to me. Why was I chosen? I felt confused and numb, but I had to put those feelings aside. Another crisis had to be resolved as I had to prepare to handle the other call from tomorrow, today.
