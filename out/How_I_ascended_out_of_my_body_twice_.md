I have always wanted to leave my body, I’ve always felt sort of trapped. Stuck in between a meat shield that can’t even function properly due to certain diagnoses. 

No sugarcoating, this is what I did to leave. 
Warning: I have been trying to ascend for 3 years now on and off. It has taken a long time. 

It was when I was going through especially rough times. I put a sheet over my eyes and blinked until I was able to convince myself that my eyes were open when they weren’t. I made sure I saw nothing at all besides pitch black. If you want to try this make sure the sheet ONLY covers your eyes not your nose and mouth. 

I stood like that for 30 minutes and was on my side. It would be better to do it flat on my back but I’m unable to. I keep trying to get my conscious to fly out of me. I felt myself pushing it out of brain. It caused some pain, it caused slot of discomfort. It was like trying to wake up, except you couldn’t. 

After trying that for probably what felt like another 30 minutes I felt extremely relaxed and warm. And I was able to see my body from above. I had no control over myself. I was floating away without consent. It scared me. I was terrified. I regretted ever daring to do this stupid experiment. I wanted to fly back into my body. But I was floating up. 

The wind was blowing me away without my consent. It started to lower me and take me away to some unknown town. I passed through all the routes I was familiar with until I was in an unknown place. 

Suddenly I started to backpedal quickly it felt like a blur and I felt my soul come back to my body. It felt very cold I was freezing out of my body. I’ve never been so cold before in my life, I immediately shot up horrified. 

That was 2 years ago. I knew I shouldn’t do it again, but I couldn’t help myself. I tried for another 2 years. I had no idea why I had a strong urge to do this. I should’ve stopped. I couldn’t. 

When I finally succeed I did the exact steps as before. I couldn’t believe I did it again. I felt the same relaxed feeling. But when I did it again, I got control over my consciousness. I saw my body standing there peacefully. I even saw myself twitch somehow. 

I could slide through the doors, so I left my house and went inside of a supermarket close by. I saw other people there but I don’t think they saw me”me”. I then left as I was unable to pick anything up. I kept trotting to an infamously route beyond the Walmart nearby and it wasn’t to far but I’ve never been there before. I remember how all the houses looked and all the stores nearby. I keep wandering until I felt the same fast pace feeling of my going backwards back into my body. 

BOOM! The same cold empty feeling. I again shot up. 

I never checked the time when I did this, but it seemed to feel a lot longer than it really was. Almost like a dream. And what’s weird is, one day I got curious and took the same route I recalled taking through the Walmart. And I saw the SAME houses and stores my consciousness saw.

This can’t be a coincidence. This was 3 months ago. I don’t know if I should do this again. I don’t know what it’ll eventually progress to. I’m honestly scared to find out.
