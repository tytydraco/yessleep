I honestly don't know why this is happening to me.

Everything in life was going so well for me. Everything. I've had hopes, dreams, and ambitions thrown away, friends and family I abandoned long ago. I was planning on college but had to throw that down the drain. None of it was my fault though. I never wanted to become a murderer. I never envisioned myself as someone who takes lives. I'm not that kind of man. I was forced to become something like this.

All because of that email. That goddamn email. Whoever was behind it made my life change for the worse.

It popped up when I was having dinner with some friends. We were chatting about old high school memories when the email popped up on my phone. I was puzzled at first, so I just decided to read it real quickly. It read something like this:

***Hello Mr. Fleming***

***We are happy to tell you that you have officially been chosen to become a Bounty Hunter, once a week you will be tasked to kill a target assigned to you, their name, face, address, and any other type of personal information will be shown to you. You will need to kill your target before the deadline or else you will be killed. For each target you kill, you will be awarded $1,000. You will receive your first target soon.***

I reread the email, trying to see if it was some sick joke or something. I wanted to be amused by this, but I was alarmed. Who would even send this to me, let alone manage to get my email address? It made little sense. The entire email itself made little sense. I showed the message to my friends, who scoffed it off to just some spam mail. They told me I should delete it and move on. I thought about doing just that, but at the same time, I didn't want to, partially because I wanted to inspect it to see if what the message said was the real deal or something bizarre entirely on its own.

After the bill was paid, we all went our separate ways, and I went to my house. As I got into bed, I checked the email that was sent to me one more time. Again, it seemed too good to be true. *Bounty Hunter?* *Killing a Target? $1,000?* It was all too stupid to believe. Maybe my friends were right,  this was just some weird spam mail. I turned off my phone, and put it on the charger, before going to sleep.

"Too good to be true," I thought, as I drifted off to sleep.

I woke up as the sun was shining on my bed. The sky was cloudless, showing a beautiful morning day. But I soon stopped admiring the beautiful morning sky when I felt something heavy on my right wrist. Confused, I looked at it and saw there was some robotic wristband on it. Reaching for my wrist, I fidgeted with it, trying to see if I could get it off of me but whoever put this on me ensured that it was permanently stuck to my wrist. The only way I could get the thing off me would be by cutting my hand off. But that was a stupid idea.

My phone pinged, and a new email was sent to me. I opened it, and it was from the same unknown email address from last night.

***Hello Mr. Fleming***

***We are here to tell you that your first target is ready. We have already attached the wristband that states the amount of hours you have left to kill your target. However, You can't get help from the police to deal with this. You can't entrust any of this information with any friends or family. If you tell either the police or anyone else you know about this email, then you will be killed. Let this be your first and final warning. Below is the information about your first target. You will have one extra hour to prepare, make sure you bring the necessary equipment and plan accordingly. Good luck!***

I double-read it, and even though I didn't want to believe it, the message was clear enough. I would have to kill someone. But how? And why? Why am I being forced to do this? Why am I being forced to take an innocent person's life for no reason? I'm not that type of person. I wasn't raised to be that type of person. To be that type of person who takes pleasure in hurting people. I dabbled on the question for a long moment, before eventually putting my head in my hands. I had no other choice. It was either their life or mine. If I did this I would become a murderer. If I didn't do this, I would end up dying. It's my life over someone else's.

I didn't want to kill someone, but I didn't want to die. I wanted to live, even if it meant doing an action that was heavily looked down upon throughout history.

I picked up my phone, and scrolled down the message, below was a picture of a guy with medium-length bright brown hair. Then I read the information below.

**Name: Sebastian Berg**

**Age: 27**

**DOB: November 10th, 1997**

I was surprised to find so much personal info on the guy alone. It showed me the high school he graduated from. It showed me his occupation as a Grocer, including his shifts, it showed me his home address and everything I needed to know to make sure I was ready to kill him.

I checked the wristband one last time, it read *15 hours remaining to kill your target*.

I started packing clothes, food, and other necessities for my trip. I also made sure to pack two knives, just in case a fight occurred. I especially packed a pair of gloves to avoid getting DNA anywhere. Although the guy only lived in Pennsylvania, a 3-hour drive, I had to act while I still could. I had a time limit on me after all.

As I got into my car, I realized I would have to abandon the job I had, I couldn't give him some bogus excuse as to why I was out in another state, not to mention part of the email was that I couldn't tell anyone I knew about what they were forcing me to do, that included my boss. So with a heavy heart, I called my boss and told him I was quitting work. Of course, he was confused and angry, but I hung up on him, breathing a heavy sigh. Then I started up my vehicle and began the 3-hour journey to Pennsylvania.

The drive was exhausting, but I still made it to Pennsylvania. I thought about staying at a place for the duration until I went to kill my target, and a hotel came to mind, and I quickly accepted the idea. However, I had to make two pit stops before getting a room at the hotel. The first was to go to a gas station, I refueled my tank before buying some snacks. I also bought a ski mask to conceal my identity if someone saw me. If they gave any witness testimony to the police, that would be bad news. The second was to scan out Sebastian Berg's apartment complex, so I could find a way to break in. I followed the address the email sent and arrived at the location, which was an additional half an hour away for some reason. The area wasn't that bad, but it was that good either. Just, barely decent. Looking at the house, it looked like a standard house. Nothing too grand, nothing too shitty, just a house that someone who be comfortable living in.

I drove out of the neighborhood and to the hotel. I booked a room for a few nights, and then I took the elevator to it. When I got in, I threw my bag on the floor and fell face-first into the bed. I let out a miserable sigh at the circumstances I'm now met with. Checking my wristband, it read *12 hours remaining to kill your target*. That meant I could relax for a few hours before making my move. I turned on the Hotel TV to see if they were on. Thankfully, an episode of Family Feud was on, and I sat back and watched.

\*

My eyes dwindled, and I noticed the evening sky. I then remembered my mission. I had a target to kill. I checked my wristband, and it said *5 hours remaining to kill your target*.

Shit. I probably fell asleep while watching TV, but how did I sleep so long that I lost almost 5 hours? That didn't make any sense. But I didn't have any time to ponder that question. I had to go now. I grabbed my bag and left the hotel, checking my phone, I saw that it was around 10:50 PM. I hopped into the vehicle, got the key in, and brought the car to life. Then I made my way to my target's house. The half-hour drive made me paranoid, and I tried to get there. Soon I made it with enough time to spare. I got to the front and exited my car. There was a gate in front of the house, thankfully it wasn't one of those spikey ones, it was one where you could easily hop off, which is exactly what I did.

I carefully snuck and made my way to what I assumed was the backyard. And it was a medium-sized backyard with a small garden that held lilies and sunflowers alike. "Guess he's into gardening", I thought as I looked for a way to break in. I spotted a window open on the second floor and climbed onto it. I got in and was greeted by a bedroom. Probably my target's bedroom.

He wasn't there though, as I got out of the bedroom, I looked around. On my left was the stairway downstairs to the living room, and on my right was a slightly ajar door leading to the bathroom. I crept down the stairs, hoping my target didn't hear me. I occasionally made the floorboards creak, which caused me to wince, but every time it felt like no one peered around at the noise.

As if nobody wasn't in the house to begin with.

I walked down to the living room, and my suspicion was confirmed. My target wasn't home yet. Great. That meant I had to hide and wait for them.

I considered my options and decided that the closet in the bedroom was a good spot, so I went there and hid there. The next few hours passed with torturous slowness, I felt myself sweating while waiting for my target to come now and then I would check my wristband to see how much time was left, only 2 hours left. I was beginning to panic when I heard the sound of a car pulling up onto the street. That must be my target. Footsteps followed and the door closed. The footsteps continued until they reached the bedroom

I heard a yawn and peered through the crack in the closet door. I saw him, my target. He flopped down on his bed and let out a tired groan.

"Welp, today wasn't so bad as last time," he said as he lay on the bed for a few minutes before getting up and buttoning off his dress shirt. He stopped and I heard a phone ringing, probably his. He pulled it out and answered the call.

"Oh hey Mom, how have you been?" my target said. His voice sounded exhausted

I held the knife in my hand.

"Some days are hard but I'm trying to work through it all. Don't worry about me. I'll visit you soon. We can catch up on things. We could maybe even go out to dinner together! Just you and me. All right? All right. Love you, mom! See you on the weekend!" he said and hung up.

I let out a heavy sigh and stared at the knife. Then I stared at the wristband. I didn't want to do this. I didn't want to kill a man and leave his mother alone. But at the same time, I didn't want to lose my life. I didn't want to lose the life I enjoyed throughout the years. It was either his life or mine.

I pushed out of the closet and plunged the knife into my target's back. I felt him gasp and he stumbled back. Blood started to turn his white buttoned shirt crimson, his eyes flickered from shock to a realization of fear as he tried to make a run for the door. I caught up to him, and before he could reach the stairs I jammed the knife into his neck over and over. As he lay on the floor, I saw tears beginning to form in his eyes as he stared at mine. His hand tried to reach out to me. As to signify a desperate plea for mercy.

"P-Please..." he said, "M-my mom....she needs...me......".

"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry..." I answered. The life was gone from his eyes, and the tears had stopped escaping.

I fell to my knees and dropped the knife. My body trembled as what just happened sank into me. I killed a man.

I ran to the bathroom and threw up my guts into the toilet. I panted as tears began to dwindle from my eyes. A noise came from my wristband. I looked at it, and it said *You have successfully killed your target* It felt mocking just reading the message. As if adding a bandage on a gaping wound. That didn't matter though, I had to get out of here.

Picking up the knife, I got through the bedroom window and quickly snuck out of the backyard. Hoping over the gate I reached my car, where I took off my blood-stained hoodie and placed it in the back. Then I drove off. My heart was pounding as the house that belonged to my now-deceased target faded into the distance. I did stop at a nearby park, and in a last-ditch effort to hide the evidence, I hid the hoodie and the knife in a bush, praying that someone wouldn't notice it, and then got into my car to drive back to the hotel.

When I got into my room, I collapsed onto my bed and began to sob.  I was forced to take a man's life, but if I didn't then I would die, I had no other choice. That didn't stop me from crying though. A notification popped up from my phone, and I got an email from the unknown email address from before.

***Hello Mr. Fleming***

***We are happy to see that you have accomplished killing your first-ever target. As promised, $1,000 will be put into your bank account. We see good potential in you, please remember that you will have another target assigned to you next week, so make sure to use that time to relax and plan accordingly. You will not have to worry though, we will clean up your murder for you. Remember, you cannot tell anyone about this. Not the police or friends or family. We hope you are ready for next week's target***

I opened my bank account and the email was right. I had a notification saying I received $1,000 for my account. Yet, I felt the urge to launch my phone across the room, but I didn't. Instead, I just placed it down on the nightstand and continued crying.

\*

Since then, this has now been my job, being forced to kill strangers. Ever since I killed Sebastian Berg, I've killed about 3 people in the last 3 weeks after my first target, a mother, a teenage boy, and an old man. I never wanted to become someone like this. I never wanted to become someone that takes people's lives. But I'm being forced to do so. And I can't stop it.

This is the only place where I can share what's happening to me. My friends and other relatives have tried to call me numerous times, but I eventually put my phone on Do Not Disturb. It's not like I can tell them anyway. So I'm entrusting this to random users online. If you ever get an email similar to the one I got, and if you get a wristband on your arm, then I can't help you. You're on your own from there.

Right now I'm in my 5th target's house, he's not home yet, so I had time to type all of this out. I only have 3 hours left to kill him.

I hear a car coming down the street, probably the target. Once he comes into the bedroom, I'll be ready for him.

Wish me luck.
