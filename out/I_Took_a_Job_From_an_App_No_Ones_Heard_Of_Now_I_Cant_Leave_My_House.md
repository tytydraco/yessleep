I was two weeks into unemployment when I first heard of an app called GrindStone. Not on the App Store, not on Google Play. A link appeared in my inbox with no sender, no subject. Just: "Real work. Real pay. Real fast."

I clicked it because desperation will make you ignore red flags until they’re dragging you into traffic.

The interface was sleek. Black background. Stark white lettering. A clean "Start Working" button at the center. I tapped it.

The first task was almost laughable: “Leave a 5-star review for a business on Yelp.” It even provided the text. Five minutes later, I had ten bucks in my account. Instantly. That was the hook.

The next few days were similar. Silly stuff. Click a link. Flag a social media post. Film a short video praising a nonexistent energy drink. One task even had me send a pizza to a random address with a note that said, “You made the list.”

It was strange, sure. But the money was real. I made $1,200 in three days.

Then, the tone shifted.

**TASK: Leave a dead rat on the front steps of 1849** \[**Redacted**\] **Ave.** **PAY: $500**

I hesitated. The address was close. Less than ten blocks. My rent was overdue. My fridge was empty. The rat was provided — in a sealed cooler left on my doorstep.

I did it. No one saw. I dropped it and walked away. The money hit instantly.

I told myself it was a prank. A stupid, sick prank.

Then came the next job.

**TASK: Follow the man in the gray hoodie leaving the 24-hour laundromat on 6th. Take three photos of him without being seen.** **PAY: $1,200**

I sat in my car for hours. The man eventually appeared. He looked tired. His hoodie was soaked with sweat. He kept looking over his shoulder like he *knew*.

I followed him three blocks. Snapped the pictures. Uploaded them. I watched him go into an apartment building and vanish into the night.

The money hit. My stomach churned.

I didn’t sleep.

Then came the one that made me vomit.

**TASK: Wait in the alley behind La Casa Cafe. When you see a woman throw a garbage bag into the bin, retrieve it. Hide it in the woods. Do not open it. Do not speak to her.** **PAY: $4,000**

I waited. 1:03 AM, a woman in a white apron tossed a garbage bag that *thumped* when it hit the bin. Heavy. Too heavy for just trash.

I did what I was told. Drove 12 miles into the state forest and left it in a clearing. The bag had started to *move* by then.

The app sent me a thank-you notification. A smiling emoji followed.

I tried to delete it. It wouldn't go.

I factory reset my phone. It reinstalled during the process.

I got another task.

**TASK: Take a selfie in the mirror. Keep your back turned to the dark.** **PAY: $250**

I sat in my bathroom, facing the mirror, trembling. The lights kept flickering. I could hear something wet shifting behind the shower curtain.

I took the photo. My reflection was smiling. I wasn't.

The task updated.

**TASK: Look at the photo. Look closely.**

I did.

In the reflection, standing behind me in the shower, was a woman with no eyes. Her mouth was open too wide, as if screaming, but no sound came out. I turned around so fast I slammed into the sink.

Nothing there.

I smashed the mirror.

I turned off my phone.

It powered itself back on.

**TASK: You’ve seen her now. You’re marked. She’s part of your life. Introduce her to someone else.** **PAY: Their silence.**

The app included a shareable link.

I didn’t sleep that night. Or the next. I kept all lights on. Every reflective surface covered.

Three days later, I got another task.

**TASK: She’s getting closer. Choose someone. Fast.** **TIMER: 6 hours**

I called my brother. We hadn’t spoken in years, not really. I told him about the app. Said it was a game. I sent the link.

He downloaded it, laughing.

He took the first task: record yourself sleeping. Easy money, right?

He texted me the next morning: *“Why is there a woman crawling across my ceiling?”*

Then: *“She’s inside the walls.”*

Then nothing.

The app told me he was successful. *“She’s found a new home.”*

I smashed my phone with a hammer. Threw the pieces in a river. Got a new phone. New number. Moved to a different city.

I was safe. For a while.

Then, a package arrived. No return address. Inside was a phone. Turned on. Fully charged. Only one app installed.

GrindStone.

It opened on its own.

**TASK: Your brother failed. She came back. You owe us.** **TASK: Bring someone into the fold. Now.**

**TIMER: 00:14:59**

I locked all my doors.

I blocked the windows.

I’m typing this from inside a closet. The timer is down to two minutes.

I don’t know what happens when it hits zero. I don’t want to know.

But if you got a link in your inbox today — no sender, no subject — I’m begging you:

**Do. Not. Click. It.**
