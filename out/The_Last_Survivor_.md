"Flight M-3738 is crashing! Please take cover"  The pilot said screaming as the plane came crashing down, just a minute from hitting the ground

I awoke, on an island, very large and distorted, it was empty. I looked around but I saw no one, not even a single piece of the massive plane I was on. I walked around for hours, I didn't find a single thing, but then I saw a pond in the middle of the island, and a fishing rod by a sign saying 'you'll need this'


I thought to myself for a while, thinking why this would be placed here. Clearly someone had been here before, but where are they now? I was getting hungry so I decided to fish. After what felt like 30 minutes I only got 2. I ate the fish and decided to go to sleep. 


I don't know what time it was, but it was dark, very dark. I couldn't see a thing, so I just went back to sleep. When I awoke, I saw 3 apples in front of me. It was a miracle! But they couldn't appear out of no where, there must be a person here. I walked around, trying to find someone or something that could maybe get me off this island. I found nothing, but why wouldn't someone want to show themselves or interact with another person?

I was bored, so I decided to fish, but then I heard a noise behind me, I turned around and saw someone. They looked quite old, white hair, scruffy clothes and they had wrinkles all over them. I shouted and started chasing after them, but it vanished after I fell over. I got up quickly and went the direction they went, but the footprints just stopped. Am I imagining this? Am I going crazy? I thought to myself. But the footprints were still there, so clearly someone was here.

I stayed up until I couldn't to see if I could find that person again, but I didn't see them. Once again, I woke up to 3 apples next to me. Clearly this person is giving them to me, surely. I once again scoured the island to see if I could find them, after walking for a while I found footprints, these weren't mine.  

I followed them until they randomly stopped on stone, this is weird. "Why would they randomly stop here?" I cursed under my breathe. I stayed on the stone for a while and realised that there was a little handle it, I pulled hard and the stone opened. Revealing a secret room under the island. It was decorated, but filled with only one thing, apples. Where did all of this come from? How'd it get here?

I suddenly heard something opening behind me. Oh shit! It must be that person. I hid in one of the corners of the room. A few seconds later, I saw an old man walk in, grabbing 3 apples and walking out. It was him. I knew it. I waited a few minutes and came out of the room. Trying to navigate myself back to the pond by following the footprints. Suddenly, the man appeared behind me. Saying "I am the provider" I passed out from the shock and awoke by the pond.

I needed to get of this weird island or that man will surely do something to me, but there was only water in sight. "It's too late, isn't it" I whispered softly.
A sign then appeared behind me, I turned pale as I saw blood on the sign. I wiped it and I was shocked by what I saw. It read 'Its only been a week on the island' I then heard manic laughter behind me.
