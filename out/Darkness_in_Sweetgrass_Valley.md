Dark comes early in the mountains. Even in summer.  I was deep in a valley in the Cascades after hiking since sunrise when I rounded a corner and the the scent of sweetgrass water up from an even deeper part of the valley just below me. I spotted a path down to the 45 degree slope to the valley floor. It was dry enough and the forecast was clear enough that I felt comfortable descending to go wander through the sea of sweetgrass to find a campsite for the night. It was only 4:30 but the sun was already kissing the mountain peaks, rapidly dropping the valley below, and me in it, into shadows. Something prickled at the back of my neck, standing all the little hairs on end. A feeling like I was being watched crept over me. I shook it off and got on with setting up camp but made note of it for later. 

I have never felt as at peace as I do in the deep woods of the Pacific Northwest. It can be wildly dangerous, of course; the wilderness always is. But there is a beauty and sense of time here that is unlike anywhere else I've ever been. I grew up feeling the towering firs, hemlocks, and pines calling my soul from across the mountains clear across to the Oklahoma prairie where I was born and raised. I just knew, somehow, deep in my bones, this was where I belonged, and when I moved up here 10 years ago it felt like home from the moment I stepped off the bus. I was only 14 when I ran away, the night before what was supposed to be my wedding. I was just a kid, and in a weird way, my parents were trying to save me, promising me to Butch Camden. He was 27, and the son of the wealthiest family in the county. Not that that was saying much in Tillman County. It wasn't exactly a love match, though Butch was a good looking man, and while there wouldn't be any of the European trips I dreamed of and he would certainly have never moved out of the county where both our families had lived for 8 generations. But I would never have struggled for food and I would be able to afford to have babies and stay home with them. 

But I was only 14, and even for 1954 that was young. And I wasn't ready. So I stole a farm truck, drove an hour to the nearest town with a bus stop, and hopped on a bus headed for Washington with everything I owned in a backpack, and $500 in cash that was supposed to pay for a honeymoon for Butch and me. It was enough to pay a few months rent upfront and I was able to get a job waiting tables, and in the 10 years since then, I had built a decent life for myself. And now here I was, doing what I loved most. Solo camping in these ancient woods every weekend. Exploring rivers and caves, mountain valleys, ghost towns, and peaks. Watching sunrises, sunsets, the stars and the moon, all on my own. Free and independent. Alone. 

Just as I finished getting my fire started, after I had set up camp, I heard it. The snap of a twig in the distance. Then another. Closer this time. There was a chillin the air. It may be June, but nights are still cold up here in the mountains at night. My fire was probably attracting the attention of some of the local wildlife. Hopefully just deer. I listened a little longer, just in case, but it was quiet except the normal sounds of the back country. I turned my attention back to the fire and started prepping my dinner. While my chili heated over the fire, I rolled up a joint and had myself awl well deserved smoke and some water. After dinner under stars, and with a pleasant high still going, I stripped down and laid out on my blanket under the stars. Just watching the endless sea of them glitter above, feeling the cool night air on my skin, and luxuriating in the absolute freedom of true solitude.

 I started tracing my hands over my body, relishing the sensation of little goosebumps popping up along my soft skin. As I listened to the soft rustle of the wind through the trees and inhaled deeply to savor the smell of the sweetgrass, my hands drifted over my body, rubbing and touching. I heard the snap of twigs again, getting closer. I ignored it as I continued plucking and rubbing at my nipples, working one hand down my stomach and between my legs as I spread them apart and began to dip my fingers in and out, in and out, up and down and around. The twig snapping was circling closer and closer. I kept going, embracing the full freedom to be as loud as I like. Despite the full throated volume of my pleasure, I still kept a sharp ear out for the approaching footsteps snapping the twigs as they came ever so slowly closer. Now, as I reached my peak, I could hear labored breathing in the trees, and then a stifled grunt. I peaked again and again, moaning loudly as the labored breathing and grunting in the trees got heavier and heavier. 

I closed my eyes in bliss, enjoying the afterglow of series  of ferocious orgasms. Muffled panting drifted across the air from the trees, along with the scent of my persuer. I took a deep breath and was able to tease out the scents of sweat, pheromones, and semen. I could tell from the sound of him, the grunts, the panting, the way the twigs had snapped under his feet as he had circled me in what he thought was secrecy, that he was big. Probably 6'6". Heavier built and strong. I could feel his eyes still raking over my delicate 5" frame. I could feel his not yet fully sated hunger pulsing inside him. Hot, throbbing, hunger. He was nearly spent but he still wanted more. You can always tell when a predator is still hungry. 

I stretched and rolled over on my side, then pulled myself to my feet. In a flash, I began running, full speed into the woods, trees flashing past in a blur, my bare feet pounding across the forest floor, my breath coming faster and faster as I ran. I heard his footsteps behind me as he rushed across the little clearing where my camp was set up, into the forest after me. I ducked behind a large tree, held my breath, and listened as his footsteps got closer and closer. He stopped just ahead of me, where he had heard my footfalls stop. I let out a small whistle and smiled as he turned. Flashing triple rows of razor sharp teeth as I unhinged my jaw and launched forward and upward, landing, perched on his shoulders, swallowing his scream and feeling it reverberate down my throat as my teeth ripped his head from his neck. 

I dropped his body where he stood, and covered in his blood, realigned my jaw, retracted my teeth, and sauntered back through the woods to my campsite. I rolled another joint, sat back down in front of my fire, and marvelled at the stars again. It's almost a shame for him that he's missing out on all this beauty. 

They'll never find his body. Just like they never found mine,  years ago. By morning his teeth will be coming in. By nightfall we'll both be gone. Now he too, will always be able to tell when a predator is still hungry.
