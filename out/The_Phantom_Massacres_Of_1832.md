“Large crows spread their wings and span large across an empty sky before swooping down into the town, pecking away at the bodies of several families strewn savagely along the main street of Harlow.” The words of law enforcement when writing about the incident. The worst in a series of strange massacres along the Texan/Arizona border with Mexico in 1832. Three small towns, all horribly attacked by factions unknown over the course of 3 months. A Sheriff, two deputies and a small posse descended on the town of Harlow to find a slaughter. The town had a population of around 32, and all their bodies accounted for. Heads dashed against rocks, bodies posed and… violated. The worst of which was a young man, impaled upwards by 4 long spears and placed in the center of town. Symbols were drawn in white paints and powders, “Horrid, crude things depicting pale white figures with deformed faces, strange jewelry that seemed pierced into their necks, their eyes red and the skin around them pulled back by metal.” 

This was the first time evidence of the attackers was left, in the prior months similar scenes were found without a trace of anyone or anything. One day these settlements were there, raising livestock, families, and then one day someone finds the aftermath. The first was a smaller, newly founded settlement, no name had even been given yet. They settled down by a riverbed, some miles from El Paso, about 3 families had found a prosperous clearing to build, a young man had been sent to arrange the transportation of lumber, he was the one who found them. After a day he came riding over the ridge, and saw flames. The tents and what little was built was decimated, the men, women and children slain. Solid black, crude spears covered the grounds, dipped in oils and set ablaze, dozens raining down on them in what must have been the dead of night, half of them were caught in their beds. The rest raced out, and apparently tried to fight. None of them survived and from the looks of it their efforts were entirely fruitless. The Young man was scarred, eventually taking his own life shortly after. 

The attack was instantly attributed to the Natives, Apache, specifically. Who were in fact in an ongoing conflict with the settlers. Attacks were not typically so brutal, rarely were they done on innocents as well, but it was not unheard of, and there seemed to be no other explanation. The surrounding native tribes faced heavy persecution, and when a group was arrested for the crimes, another incident occurred. Plantation owners WIliam and Sarah Shreiver were found on their road, dead, and stretched out across an effigy. The slaves they owned had all but scattered into the plains, the only account we have of this situation comes from an unfortunate recaptured slave. Late at night the property was awoken to all kinds of screams, guards and workers alike descended onto the fields, where large stills of moonshine had apparently been soaked into the dirt, and suddenly fire engulfed the largest group of men the plantation could offer. They didn’t stand a chance, everyone began to scatter as unholy wails came from beyond the fence line and then man-like figures covered in what appeared to be ash raced in from all angles, naked and on all fours like a beast they ran into the panicking crowds. The slave reported seeing a woman tackled with immense force and beaten ruthlessly by the things bare hands. The last thing he saw as everyone else sprinted for the hills were the flames spreading to the house, and the family being dragged across it. In total, 16 dead. None were slaves. 

Law enforcement was at a loss now, and though there was no attempt to release the captured natives, it was clear this was not the Apache. Things went quiet for weeks, the horrors of what happened starting to sink in the back of people's minds. Until Gertrude Smith came into a Sheriff's office east of Tucson, Arizona. Nearly naked, covered in dried blood and wounds, tears rolling down her face. Delirious, she mumbled and shook until she could tell them the name of the town, and where they were. The vultures and crows could be seen circling miles away, the town of Harlow, Arizona stood at the base of a canyon, the blood spilled on the dirt was visible from over a mile.

“The strong smell of the metal of blood and the rot of death was sent to us by a strong gust, the men recoiled, one refused to go on. When we walked through the defaced town sign I nearly vomited. Bodies of men women and… the young, defiled. Horrific drawings and symbols spread across the dirt and homes. God was looking elsewhere on this day.” 

-Sheriff Truman

This incident was special, not only had this become  the highest victim count, the attackers had finally left evidence of their existence, heavy evidence. After the bodies were gathered and loaded for burial the town was taken apart and searched. No valuables were taken of any kind, no food, clothing, jewelry. But the details of the incident were incredibly recorded by young Gertrude herself, who cataloged what could be only described as an unholy multiple day raid of these figures in her diary. The pieces here have been abridged from the original text, as no access to the diary pages are public. 

“Pa came in concerned tonight, a man who my whole life has been so stern and stoic looked white as a ghost. He sent me away, and of course I stayed behind the wall to listen. He and the boys were hunting on the ridge and saw something, some strange animals they thought until they got closer, saw it standing on its legs like a man. Ghastly white and tall, from miles down the crick he snapped a look at them, and walked back into the brush. He angrily said something of the Apache, but he didn’t seem so sure. Surely sleep won’t come easy tonight.” 

“The sunset was a deep red, I was astonished by its beauty. The rolling clouds puffing in ephemeral astonishment, stretching wide across and complimenting the equally red dirt of the desert plains. Pa is still filled with worry of what he saw, so the red sky seems like bad omens to him, but this reminds me of why we settled here, hoping for more to come.” 

A day passed, seemingly without incident except for another, unusual blood red sunset. Things ramped up quickly.

“Mary has gone missing, her and Jerimiah snuck down to the creek together this morning, nobody has heard anything since. Pa sent everyone inside, we are not to leave or be alone. He spent hours down in the valley but they came back with nothing. Men are heading into town as soon as they can to fetch help, things are concerning to say the least. Mother has spent all day rocking in her chair with little Davy, she won’t talk about any of it, Pa grows angry with any mention and he has already broken into the stills. I’m left alone with these fears.”

There was never a report given regarding the disappearance of young Mary and Jermiah with any law enforcement at any point, the men who went to report this were in fact, never heard from again. 

“The men have yet to return, night is approaching and they left yesterday afternoon. Even a leisure ride shouldn’t have this much delay.”

That very night the attacks began. 

“They came, they came in the night. I awoke to something rapping at my window, and I looked up in the candlelight to an unholy, swollen face. Ashen white, pressed against the glass, a vile smile with twisted fangs for teeth. I screamed, I screamed so loud the devil himself heard me, Pa was in the room in his shotgun in seconds and he fired at it. The shot, the glass and wood breaking was too much, I ran so fast from my bed I hit the wall head first. The face was gone, but we heard more screaming. Pa went to the window and screamed ‘They’re taking her’ and ran outside. Mother and I looked out, and saw 2 more of the wretched things, dragging away Theodore and Cindy by their heads into the brush. A small group chased them in, we heard the screams come and go for hours. Pa wants to leave, he needs to get the law. I don’t want him to leave, I can’t be here alone.” 

“Pa went to the road hours ago, nothing yet. No screams, no howls. Clarence and his boys are sat on the roofs watching the trees with their rifles, but the sun is falling, the horizons dragging it into void. The sudden redness of the sky and clouds is haunting.”

“Screams again, the boys were watching from the roof all night but they got in. Jeremiah was dragged into the bush, ungodly, guttural noises came after. We all will be leaving in the morning, at first light we take our chances.” 

This had been the last entry, it would seem at first light something else arrived. Gertrude never spoke of what happened, in fact she never spoke again. She lived with family in the north after, and they reported she lived in a solemn quiet for the remainder of her life. This was the last attack, nothing of the sort was reported again. Search parties combed the canyons for days, but there was seemingly nothing. No signs of these figures, no tracks, no camps. On the final day however, a group stumbled upon a large stretch of volcanic rocks and spotted a strange, unnatural structure at the base of a rock hill. They crossed the sharp, unforgiving rock landscape and found a large, petrified tree that had been expertly carved. Several black, human-like faces with mouths agape sticking out from all angles, described as twisted and demonic. The group destroyed it, chopping it into bits and leaving it to the wind. The search parties disbanded, and the site has remained unoccupied ever since. The story not widely reported, and kept in the annals of history. Referred to by the few who know as The Border Massacres Of Texas or more hauntingly, the Phantom Massacres. Critics refer to Gertrudes recollection of events as greatly exaggerated, and seem to completely disregard the reports of the twisted effigy entirely. However these same critics also commonly have a vested interest in keeping these incidents from the wider public, disregarding any connections between events. Like much from the past and especially the dark past of early America it will forever be shrouded in mystery, an inconclusive autopsy of a gruesome history.
