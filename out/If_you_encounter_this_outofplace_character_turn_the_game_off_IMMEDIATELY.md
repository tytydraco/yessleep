I really don't know if this has happened to anyone else before, but just in case it does, take this story as a reminder. You'll thank me later.

I was around 15 when this happened, it was also (ironically) October and just eighteen days away from Halloween. I had just went back to my room after having fish and chips for dinner and out of boredom, i decide to play on my gaming computer. I chose a classic, Team Fortress 2, and went as Pyro since i like to burn everything i see in my path for fun.

I was on the map Thunder Mountain, we were getting near the check point and the enemy team were beating our asses, so i decided to flank them by surprise, while trying not to get headshot by one of their four Snipers. I was nearly at the other side in the left building, where it overlooked the enemy base, and had my Scorch Shot ready when i noticed *it*.

A corpse, sitting at the bottom of the stairs.

I thought it was a player at first, but when i looked closely, it didn't look like any of the nine classes. In fact, it didn't looked like it belonged in the game at all. It was more polished than Team Fortress 2's actual graphics, it looked like a man wearing a brown suit, but covered in blood and the jaw was hanging open in the most uncomfortable way i could imagine. It looked like it was dislocated and stretched downwards.

I was already used to violence in games, but this felt a bit too real for me.

Eventually, i decided to just walk past it, but the game decided to lag when i did so. This lag then got me killed by an enemy Soldier, who i didn't see coming at all, hell i didn't even have enough time to airblast his rocket back at him.

We won the first round anyways, but i had school tomorrow so i turned off my game and went to bed. I still don't know what i saw, but since it was Halloween, i thought that maybe it was just a strange easter egg that the creators put in.

That same thought aged like milk when i saw it again in Minecraft.

I was playing with a friend overseas (i'm Australian) and we decided to try and find some diamonds like most Minecraft players would do, we find a cave and kill any mobs that got in our way. I had the most torches so i gave half of them to my friend and decided to split up like idiotic characters from a horror movie. 

Now this is where we enter the *nope* territory.

At this point, i was lost in the cave and i only had like nine torches left, so i placed them anywhere i could find and just as i placed the fifth torch, there it was.

Still in the same position, but it didn't even look like a Minecraft character at all, it didn't even have a few blocky polygons. It jumpscared me so fucking badly i nearly fell out of my seat, like i literally jolted so hard that my headphones were ripped out from my computer.

I stood away from my computer, my heart beating like a drum and my breathing matching the same speed, then i calmed down when i noticed my friend saying in the chat;

"Yo, i found a few diamonds, let's get outta this creepy ass place!"

I turned my back on the non-blocky corpse and i was just replying to my friend when i noticed yet another message in chat, but it wasn't from my friend, it was from a player with a blank username. They said;

"***DON'T LEAVE***"

I turned around to face it again, but now it was standing up. I never disconnected from a game that fast in my whole fucking life.

Later on, i got a message from my friend, asking me why i suddenly left the game. I explained what had happened and asking him if he saw the message in the chat that asked me not to leave, i was expected him to ask me if i was joking, but i didn't expect him to say "Wait i actually did see that message, i thought our server was private? Did you download a mod from a sketchy site?"

I never downloaded any mods, but you probably already knew that.

So i'm not crazy, my friend saw it's message and if that was the case, i needed to find the player who killed me from Team Fortress 2 the other day. I managed to find them and asked if they recall seeing a corpse where they killed me in Thunder Mountain.

"I guess i did? It was probably a spy, why u asking me this bro?"

Funny thing is, there were no Spies on our team.

I had no idea what the hell i was dealing with: A ghost inside my computer? An advanced virus that was secretly downloaded? Who knows.

Then came the worst night of my life.

I was fast asleep when i heard my phone's notification buzzing from my bedside table, i groaned as i woke up and grabbed my phone, reading what was sent to me.

"***WHY DID YOU LEAVE?***"

It was from an unknown number, it was blank.

"Who is this?" i replied, which when i look back at it today, was a stupid fucking decision.

They immediately replied with "***IF YOU WON'T LET ME OUT. I WILL LET MYSELF OUT***"

Suddenly, my computer turned on by itself, like it literally booted itself up! I watched as my desktop background turned into a horrifying image i'll never erase from my brain.

It was a closeup of the corpse, it was staring at me with bulging ready-to-explode eyes, even though they were facing different directions. The detail on it's jaw injury looked so realistic, it was like something from a LiveLeak video.

I was scared stiff, so scared that i pissed my sheets without a care, then it started to move. 

It raised its left arm at a slow pace and threw a punch at the screen, then repeat and repeat until the punching got a bit more faster. The banging got so loud that i snapped out of my stiffness and quickly crawled off my bed and to my computer, then pulling the plug out. Long story short, i ended sleeping in the living room that night.

The unknown number had vanished, like it never existed.

I stopped using my computer for a while, that night spooked me to my fucking core, i wasn't able to sleep unless i put a sheet over my computer. (Which i still do this today, yes i still have it. I'm thinking of selling it someday)

Months later, we ended up having to move out. I was packing my things from my room and i was about to pack away my computer when i noticed something on the screen, it was small but it was able to make my blood run cold.

It was a tiny crack.
