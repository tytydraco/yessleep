*Pit, Pat, Pit, Pat.*

I step out of my car as the cool spring rain runs down my face.  A blanket of greyscale fluff covers the sky, and the sounds of a suburban train station flood my ears. I guess if I were an edgy teen I'd describe it as a melancholy day. Not that I really care, though. I've never minded the rain. There's nothing quite like the calming feeling you get when you hear the soft splashes of water hitting the sidewalk.

*Pit, Pat, Pit, Pat.*

I'm at the station, waiting for my train. See, there's this important meeting out of town, and I'm hoping it goes well. As I sit and wait for my train, I trail off in thought about mundane tasks I'll have to perform when I get home. The only sound I can hear is rain, soft and gentle. I don't notice the sounds of the suburbs disappearing.

*Pit, Pat, Pit, Pat.*

I'm brought out of my trance by the loud bell of the nearby railroad crossing. *Ding, ding, ding*. It's quite an atmosphere. The train whistles right on time, and the culmination of sounds brings me to full attention of my surroundings. I am uneasy. Something is *off*. The other potential train riders have vanished, and there's not a single vehicle parked in any spot, let alone driving down the road. It's almost as if I'm the last man on Earth. I like my alone time as much as the next guy, but something is seriously wrong. I am unsure of what to do as my train screeches to a halt.

*Pit, Pat, Pit, Pat.*

The train door stands ajar in front of me. Not a single passenger can be seen through the windows. The train calls to me, and I'm finding it hard to resist its temptation. The calming rain eases my discomfort. You can always take solace in the presence of the rain, that's something I've stood by for years. I must ride the train.

*Pit, Pat, Pit, Pat.*

I take a step forward toward the open doors.

*Pit, Pat, Pit, Pat.*

Another.

*Pit, Pat, Pit, Pat.*

Again. Faster.

*Pit, Pat, Pit, Pat.*

I'm almost running into the train door when my foot feels wet. I stop two feet away from the train and look down. A puddle. Its a normal puddle, but the problem? I didn't hear the splash. I can't hear *anything*. Not my shoes slamming the pavement, not the wind blowing the rain into my face, and not even my own breathing. I snap my fingers. Nothing. Fear consumes my body as I back away from the train. I realize just how long the doors have been open. Its waiting for *me*. It has to be. I dare not even attempt to scream. Not even I would hear it. All that remains is the trancelike sounds of the rain.

*Pit, Pat, Pit, Pat.*

This is all I can hear. It's becoming deafening. What was once a sound of comfort has become a living nightmare. What do I do? Do I run? Wait for the train to leave? I don't know. All I know is that I am NOT getting on that train. No matter what I do, I cannot allow it to tempt me aboard. I have a feeling if I get on that train, I'll never be seen again. It takes every amount of power I can muster to hold myself in place. The truth is, I couldn't run if I wanted to. The allure of the train is too strong. All I can hope for is the departure of the train. Who knows when that'll be? Think. Think! There has to be somethi-

I notice the rain has stopped. Sound finally returns to my ears. How I wished to hear anything but the rain.

*Pit, Pat, Pit, Pat.*

The sound comes from behind me. I don't even dare turn around.

I wish it was the rain.
