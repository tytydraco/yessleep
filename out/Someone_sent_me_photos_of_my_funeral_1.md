My mother is standing over an open grave with bloodshot eyes while clutching the arm of my father. My father has his gaze averted, not able to look into the hole in the ground prepared for my casket. 

In another photo, my childhood friends Mia and Ted are holding each other's hands, both dressed in all black.

And then there is one from afar but I can clearly recognize my sister Emma. She is holding the plush rabbit I gave her for her tenth birthday to her chest and she's wearing the black dress she wore for her high school graduation. The weirdest part is that it appears as if she's staring right at the camera, her head slightly tilted.

That one hurt the most to look at.

Except maybe for the one with the gravestone. 

**Liam Miller**  
**1999 - 2024**  
**Beloved son and brother.**

My name. My year of birth. And the year I died.

The photos were sent to me from an unknown number. And I can't even say how long I spent staring at them, zooming into different faces and things in the background. I took in every detail, trying to figure out if it was AI-generated or if some very sick person had created them with Photoshop. Either way, they were fake of course as I was very much alive and did not have a funeral. 

But even knowing that, I couldn't help the knot forming in my throat. And then I deleted them. And blocked the number. Some might consider that stupid because I was deleting proof of some form of harassment but those photos just made me feel sick. All I wanted was to be rid of them.

And I kept it a secret. I didn't want the people I loved, who were in those photos, to see them, to watch themselves grieving me. Especially not my family. 

When you are in your twenties, or any other age I could imagine, the last thing you want to be reminded of is your death. Especially so visually. I've had issues with anxiety semi-regularly since high school. It's gotten better ever since I finished college, and found a job and my own apartment but those photos triggered something. This irrational feeling of paranoia kept following me and when I couldn't sleep properly anymore, I took some time off of work and decided to visit my parents. 

I drove down without warning them because I thought it might be a nice surprise for them as well. And for Emma. She still lived at home and asked me to visit quite often. 

Luckily I had a key because when I got there no one was home. I made my way upstairs to my room to drop off my bags when I passed Emma's bedroom and froze in front of her open door.

The dress, her black graduation dress that she wore on the photos of my funeral was laid out on the bed. The plush rabbit she'd been clutching to her chest draped right on top of it.

This couldn't be a coincidence. I went inside the room and sat down on her bed, inspecting both the rabbit and the dress - not sure what exactly I was looking for. 

"Liam?" The voice of my sister startled me. I hadn't heard the front door open or shut. Neither did I hear the wood creak beneath the staircase that led upstairs.

Slowly I turned around. My sister was standing there as if she'd seen a ghost. She was the female copy of my Dad, it became more apparent the older she got. The same strawberry blonde hair, pale skin full of freckles, and athletic style. I was more like my Mum, tan with black slightly curly hair. 

"Fucking hell, you scared me half to death, what are you doing here?" She walked up and tried to hug me but I stayed frozen.

"I came to- to visit. Where are Mum and Dad?"

She took a step back and frowned.

"Visiting Aunt Carol for the week. Didn't you call them?"

I shook my head.

"Is everything okay, Liam? You seem weird."

"What are you doing with that dress?" I pointed to her room.

She snorted.

"Was cleaning out my closet, why do you care?"

Without another word, I turned away and headed towards my room, Emma following close behind.

"How long are you staying? Did something happen? Why didn't you call?" 

I turned around abruptly and hissed "This is my home, can't I just stop by?"

She shrugged.

"Yeah, jeez sorry, I was just asking."

"Good, you just did. Now can I have some peace and unpack?"

After calling my parents and confirming that they were really gone for the whole week, I joined my sister in the kitchen to apologize. Seeing that dress triggered something inside of me and while I'm not proud of it, it made me suspect my sister. Why would she lay out the same thing she was wearing in those photos? It made me wonder if she was the one who sent them to me. But then again, she didn't even know I was stopping by and what reason could she have to pull such a sick prank? 

"Hey, sorry about being so weird earlier. I'm happy to see you," I said.

She tilted her head.

"Yeah, what was that about?"

I shrugged.

"Been a little stressed out lately." I walked over and kissed her on the top of her head. "So, what are we making?" I asked, pointing to the vegetables she had laid out on the counter.

"Your last meal," she responded in a dry tone.

I swallowed. "What?"

"Veggie lasagna. Why are you looking at me like that?"

I grabbed her by the arm.

"What did you say before that?"

"Ve-ge-tari-an la-sagna." she enunciated each word. "You won't die if you don't eat meat for one meal, you know."

She shook her head and handed me a knife. "Can you chop up an onion?"

Emma changed the topic and started cheerily chatting about all kinds of things that were happening in her life. A boy she started dating, how happy she was that she was finally on summer break from college, and what her friends were up to. All the time I was only half listening, the loud ticking of the kitchen clock in the background numbing out everything else. 

I was going mad, that was it. Either that or my sister had a really sick sense of humor. My pulse started racing, the feeling of nausea washing over me 

"Hello? Liam?" Emma pulled me out of my thought jungle. "Are you just gonna keep standing there? It will take at least forty minutes in the oven."

I hadn't even noticed that everything was finished and that Emma was already loading up the dishwasher.

"I think I'm gonna take a quick nap," I mumbled and headed to my room.

I can't say how long I slept but it must have been much longer than half an hour because when I opened my eyes again, it was already dark outside. 

Groggily, I made my way to the kitchen but it was empty. No sight of Emma so headed to the living room where I saw that the table was already set. 

I blinked a few times to make sure I wasn't imagining things. The table wasn't set for a simple dinner. Red candles were burning in ancient iron candle holders. In the middle of the table was a photo frame, surrounded by pamphlets. 

"Emma?" I shouted but there was no response. A knot started forming in my gut as I walked close to the table and picked up the frame. The picture inside was a black and white version of a photo of me, taken last year on my birthday. 

The pamphlets were for different funeral homes in town. The photo frame slid from my hand to the floor, glass splintering and pieces flying in all directions. It felt as if everything was happening in slow motion. My heart was racing so hard I was sure it would break out of my chest.

"Emma?" I shouted even louder than before. "Emma, where are you? What is this? This isn't fucking funny." 

There was not one sound coming from inside the house. I raced up the stairs and passed her room but it was empty so I went into mine to get my phone. I needed to send my parents photos of this because something was definitely not right with my sister. 

I found my phone on my nightstand and realized that I had five missed calls from my mother. My phone was on silent so I hadn't noticed her calls while I was sleeping.

A lump settled in my throat. With shaky hands, I called my mother and slumped down on the bed. 

"Liam?" Her voice was merely a whisper. 

"Mum-," I started but she interrupted me.

"Oh, thank god. Are you okay? Your sister called me earlier and got me really worried. She said you showed up out of nowhere and started acting a little strange. And then you wouldn't pick up the phone.."

I swallowed.

"No, I'm not acting strange. Emma is- She's going mad or something, playing mind games with me and-." 

"Stop," her voice was merely a whisper. "You sound just like Ben." She sniffled on the other end and then her voice got louder again. "Liam, honey. You really scared her."

I huffed out a laugh. That witch had called my parents to tell them some dumb story, painting me as the crazy one. 

"Who the hell is Ben? Okay, I have no idea what she's told you but I'm actually worried about her. She did something really- wait I'll just show you." 

I switched the call to video and made my way back to the living room so my mother could see the insane funeral preparations my sister had been crafting. But as I walked into the room, it was all gone.

No candles, no photo, no pamphlets. On the table was the dish with half-eaten lasagna and a clean plate with cutlery.

"She made you dinner? That's what you're so riled up about?"

"No, Mum. This wasn't here just yet," I countered. "She must have moved it. Emma," I shouted again. 

"Liam, your sister is not home. She called me an hour ago on her way to her friend Leila."

My mind was blank. My mother kept talking to me but I didn't know how to respond. And I started wondering if I was the one making this all up. Another form of fear came over me when I worried that my own mind couldn't be trusted.

Finally, I apologized to my mother and made up some excuses about me being tired and groggy. And that I didn't mean to scare Emma. It took a while but finally, she reluctantly hung up. 

I started taking myself into believing that I was wrong - That my little sister was probably just looking forward to a simple dinner with me and I had scared her so much that she took off to stay with a friend instead of her own home.

And I might have truly believed that if it weren’t for the red wax stains[ on the table](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/).
