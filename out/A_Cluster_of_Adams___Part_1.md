**March 31st**

Mother and I have been stuck in this room for at least six months. She tells me it's six feet by ten feet which isn't very big.  I know she's bigger than me, so it's even worse for her as I'm only 14 years old and I'm told I'm small for my age. I believe mother when she tells me as I haven't seen another kid my own age, or... another kid of any age in a long time. The walls are yellow and made of concrete. The floor is white and also made of concrete. I guess the whole room is made of concrete. We're surrounded by concrete. Mother and I live in concrete.

We have a bed with two pillows and a blanket in the corner but it's so small that sometimes mother has to sleep on the floor. I feel so bad for her. I offer to sleep on the floor instead as mother keeps saying she has a bad back but she always insists. There is also a small toilet and sink in the corner. Before we go to sleep mother uses the sink to wash me. She usually washes herself in the mornings before I wake up. There is a small drain on the floor that collects the water. Mother says it's a God-send. No one wants a wet floor.

It's very bright in here as the light on the ceiling is always on. Mother told me she got in trouble once for standing on the bed and unscrewing the bulb while I was asleep. She told me if she does it again she'll lose her hand. I don't want mother to lose her hand. She won't tell me who told her that though.

In the top corner of the room by the large steel door, there's a camera that has a little red light on it. Mother tells me not to look at it but I often find myself glancing up at it. I just can't help myself. She said it meant they were watching us. I'm not sure who "they" are or why they want to watch us. I don't think we ever do anything interesting. I once asked mother who was watching us and with tears in her eyes, she told me she didn't know.

A few days ago, they installed some shelves on the wall, although I'm not sure why as we don't have anything to put on them. We must have been asleep when they were installed because they were just there one morning when we woke up. 

There's a TV over the door that plays old movies throughout the day. Mother is getting sick of them as it's always the same movies playing over and over. I can name them all! *Gone with the Wind*, *Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves*, *The Last Man on Earth*, *The Front Page*, *Bugs Bunny*, and *Susie the Little Blue Coupe*. Bugs Bunny is my favorite! I don't really understand the other movies and mother and I don't pay attention to them anymore when they're on.

When the TV turns off we know it's bedtime. There are no windows or clocks in here so the TV lets us know when it's time to go to sleep. Every day when we wake up it's turned back on.

There is a slot in the door they feed us through. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Yesterday for breakfast, we had scrambled eggs, toast, tomatoes, and orange juice. For lunch, a ham sandwich, rice, and a box of milk. For dinner, cold pasta, a roll, and orange juice again. I thought it all tasted great but mother always refers to it as "prison food." We never get candy. Except once a few months ago! We got candy canes with our lunch and mother told me it must be the holidays before bursting into tears and wishing me a "Merry Christmas."

We're not allowed to look through the slot in the door either. It has a flap that can be lifted but Mother told me never to lift the flap or try to look out there. I imagined it wasn't anything special but I was still very curious. I won't disobey mother though. She's my whole world. I love her so much.

When we're done eating we have to put our trays, utensils and garbage back through the slot. We're not allowed to keep anything in our room except a pen and this journal I'm writing in now. Mother said I could write in it but to not write anything bad about them. She didn't want them reading it and getting mad. They also give us fresh clothes every day that are identical to the ones we've been wearing. When we run out, they give us a new bar of soap, toilet paper, and toothpaste. Mother says she wishes we could get shampoo but I don't mind having my hair washed with regular soap.

We know it's been at least 6 months because mother started keeping track a little while ago by leaving tally marks on the wall with her bobby pin. There are a hundred and twenty-nine marks as of this morning. That's a lot of days since we first started counting. Because of the Christmas candy canes Mother says she thinks she can figure out exactly what day it is. She just has to remember which months had thirty days and which months had thirty-one.

"Thirty days hath September, April, June and November. All the rest have thirty-one, except February alone" she would often repeat to herself. I loved that little poem. I've heard it so much now I'll never forget it.



**April 1st**

According to mother, today is April 1st. Exactly sixty days until my birthday. I hope in sixty days we're not still in here. Even though I know mother has given up on wishing us out of here I haven't given up hope.

*Gone with the Wind* is playing on the TV again. I sat on the floor while mother sat on the bed. We were both staring at the TV but neither of us were really paying attention. There's nothing else to do though! My eyes were beginning to glaze over when the slot in the door opened and two trays of food came sliding in. Perfect! I thought as I was beginning to get hungry. I could smell chicken and immediately got excited. I loved it when they gave us chicken.

Mother stood up and walked over to the door.

"Mmm," she said smelling her tray. "Chicken, potatoes, and green beans."

I excitedly hopped up and grabbed my tray.

"And apple juice!" I shouted excitedly.

My favorite meal! Well... not the green beans. If it was corn instead this would be perfect.

I sat back on the floor and began digging into my food while mother sat on the bed.

When we finished, we put our trays and utensils back through the slot like always. When *Gone with the Wind* had finished, *The Last Man on Earth* started playing but only moments later the TV turned itself off.

"Bedtime," mother said. She washed me up in the sink and we brushed our teeth. When we were finished we both hopped into the tiny bed that was literally only two feet away. Mother cuddled me as we put the blanket over our heads to block out the intensely bright light shining from the ceiling.

"Mother?" I asked her feeling her warm embrace. "Do you think they'll let us out of here, tomorrow?"

She sighed. "I'm not sure, Adam. I really hope so."

"Well, if not tomorrow, maybe the next day?"

She sighed again. "If not tomorrow, maybe the next day," she repeated to me. "Now get some sleep.

I lay there thinking about how fun it would be playing outside with other kids. Going to school, hanging out with friends and playing video games. I often fantasized about that before going to sleep. After only a few minutes I dozed off.



**April 2nd**

The next morning I awoke to see mother standing in front of the sink washing her face. I sat up and stretched my arms only to feel an extreme sense of shock when I saw another boy in the room with us! He was sitting in my spot on the floor staring up at the TV, drinking a bottle of what appeared to be grape juice. I stared at the back of his head for a moment feeling utter confusion.

"*Mother*!" I said pointing at the stranger. "Who *is* he!?"

Mother stared at me for a moment with an unimpressed look on her face.

"Don't be silly," she said.

The boy turned back to look at us and I saw that he looked exactly like me! It had been months since I'd looked in a mirror but I still knew what I looked like! This boy was my clone! My... what was that word? Doppelganger? He then went back to watching the TV unfazed by my questions to mother. Or maybe he just wasn't paying attention.

"Breakfast is on the floor at the end of the bed," mother said. "You should eat it now because I don't think it's gone completely cold yet."

"Mother, why is he in here!?" I asked her. Once again she looked at me unimpressed.

"Eat your breakfast, Adam. I don't like these games."

"I'm being serious!" I shouted at her. "*Who is he!?*"

"It's your brother!" she snapped at me. "You know very well who it is. Now, for the third time, eat your breakfast!"

I hopped out of bed still feeling utterly and completely baffled as to what was happening. I walked over and picked up my tray of food without taking my eyes off this new person. This... this clone of me.

I sat down next to him and noticed he too had a tray of food. The same thing as me. Pancakes, berries, and grape juice. I stared at him stuffing fork fulls of pancake into his mouth as he stared at the TV. Finally, he looked over at me and smiled.

"Nice of you to finally wake up, Adam, ya butthead," he said playfully hitting me in the arm. My sense of shock had not subsided even the tiniest bit. I could not stop staring at him. I looked back to see that mother was minding her own business, now washing her hair in the sink. How did she not find this weird? Why did she not seem surprised at seeing a boy in our room who looked exactly like me?

I looked back at this new person, now slurping down his last few drops of grape juice.

"Who - who are you?" I asked him. He looked at me with the same unimpressed look mother had given me when I had asked her.

"Shut up," he said.

"Adam2!" Mother shouted at him. "Don't tell your brother to shut up."

"Adam2?" I asked him. He stared at me again, now with a confused look on his face.

"Adam1?" he asked me in a mocking tone. He then went back to staring at the TV. "I hate this movie," he whined. "When are they gonna put Bugs Bunny back on?"

I gasped. Not only did he look just like me but he sounded just like me, talked just like me, ate his food just like me, and even loved Bugs Bunny just like me!

He looked at me again and asked "Hey, when you're done eating did you wanna play Rock, Paper, Scissors?"

Nothing about this was computing. He was talking to me like he knew me. Like everything was normal and he'd been in this room with us the entire time. He stared at me waiting for me to answer.

"Sure," I finally said.

"Okay! Well, hurry up! I'm already done mine" he replied hopping up and sliding his empty tray through the slot in the door. He even knew the rules here! None of this made sense!

I set my tray down and walked over to mother who was almost done washing her hair.

"Mother, please," I pleaded with her. "This is weird, right? Why are you pretending this isn't weird?"

She gave me a quick angry glance and went back to washing her hair.

"Mother, he wasn't here yesterday. Why does he look *just like me*? Why did you call him my 'brother?' Don't you find this scary?"

"Adam, stop!" she snapped at me. "You're the one that's being weird. First I have to deal with you two fighting all the time, now I have to deal with whatever you're doing right now. Be nice to your brother. Now for the fourth time, go eat your breakfast!"

Can a 14-year-old go crazy? I always thought it was just old or sick people that went crazy but now I was beginning to wonder if maybe I was. Or maybe I was right and mother was the one who was going crazy.

I went and sat back down on the floor next to Adam2 and picked up my tray.

"You got in trouble. You got in trouble," Adam2 jokingly taunted me.



We did play Rock, Paper, Scissors when I had finished eating but it wasn't fun to me at all. Ten out of ten times we played we would choose the exact same thing.

"Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!"

We both picked rock.

"Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!"

We both picked rock again.

"Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!"

We both picked paper this time.

"Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!"

We both picked scissors.

"Okay... I think I'm done playing," I said to him.

"But we're tied!" he complained. "Tiebreaker game?"

"No, I'm done," I replied.

"Baby," he moaned. "Wanna play the Guessing Game?"

"What's that?" I asked him. He stared at me like I was an idiot. I was getting sick of his stares.

"The one we play every day."

"You'll have to explain it to me."

Adam2 sighed. "You're being weird. The one where one of us puts our hands behind our back and hold up some fingers. Then the other one guesses how many they're holding up. You know... the Guessing Game."

"Oh," I replied. No, I didn't know the Guessing Game but Adam2 was acting like we'd played it a thousand times before. "Sure."

"I'll start," he said putting his hands behind his back. I sat there staring at him for a moment still trying to figure out if any of this was real. Trying to figure out if he was just a figment of my imagination. 

Finally, he bobbed his head and said "Hello? Are you gonna guess?"

"Oh, yes," I replied. I guessed any random number between one and ten. "Seven," I said.

"Yup!" he exclaimed excitedly revealing his hands. Five fingers on the right hand and two on the left. "Your turn!"

Something told me this would turn out the same way Rock, Paper, Scissors did.

I put my hands behind my back and held up three fingers on my right hand and one on my left hand.

"Um, four!?" Adam2 guessed. I revealed my hands.

"Yes! I knew it!" he shouted excitedly.

We played this game for another few minutes and just as I'd predicted not once did either of us guess the incorrect number of fingers. Did he not realize every game we'd played ended up with us tying each other every time? How was this fun for him?



A little while later lunch came. Three trays. Three trays for three people. Adam2 wanted to keep playing games but I just wanted to sit and stare at the TV like I'd always done. Like it was before when it was just Mother and I living in this room. I should have been happy that there was another kid for me to play with but the fact that he looked and spoke exactly like me, along with mother pretending like he'd always been here with us, terrified me. What was even scarier was that she kept referring to him as 'my brother.'

Just after lunch Bugs Bunny came on the TV. I knew I'd seen this movie many times before but I was still excited to see it come on the screen. So was Adam2.

"Yay!" he shouted as he went to sit down on my spot on the floor. That was exactly what I used to do when this cartoon came on. It was like a tradition for me.

Mother lay on the tiny bed with her pillows propped up watching the cartoon. Suddenly a thought occurred to me. Where would all of us sleep tonight? The bed was barely big enough for mother and I to the point she would sometimes sleep on the floor. We only had one blanket and two pillows. Where was Adam2 going to sleep?

No one said much as we all stared at the TV, watching Bugs play pranks on Elmer Fudd while Elmer tried his best to catch him. I sat on the bed which is something I didn't normally do. It's not that I wanted to be close to mother. I just wanted to stay away from Adam2. The movie ended and he hopped up from the floor.

"Now what?" he asked, as if there was something else we could do to pass the time. He ran up to me and slapped me on the shoulder. "Tag! You're it!" he shouted.

"No!" Mother shouted. "I've told you again and again; playing tag in here will only get you hurt. There's just not enough room."

Adam2 looked at the floor while puckering his bottom lip. A sad expression on his face. He looked up at me to see my reaction. Maybe he was seeing if I was as disappointed as he was.

"Besides," mother continued. "Dinner will likely be here soon. Then it's time to wash up and go to bed."

Just as she'd said that three trays were slid into the room through the slot. Pork chops, potatoes, coleslaw, and milk.



After dinner, Mother called us both over to the sink and had us strip down. First, she threw warm water on us, then made us soap up. Then she threw water on us again to wash off the soap. I watched the soapy water spiral down into the floor drain. We've never had towels to dry ourselves so we normally don't get redressed until after we've brushed our teeth. This gives us time to naturally dry off without getting our clothes soaked. I looked down at the sink and saw three toothbrushes. This sight surprised me for a moment but that feeling quickly subsided when I realized the third toothbrush was clearly for Adam2.

After brushing our teeth and getting redressed the TV turned off.

"Bedtime?" Adam2 asked mother.

"Yes, Adam2," she said.

He hugged her around her midsection hard and said "I love you, mother."

"I love you too, sweetie!" mother replied, hugging him back.

Seeing this set me into a fit of rage. It was one thing to have a boy here who looked, sounded, and acted exactly like me. It was another thing for him to hug my mother and tell her he loved her! Also, mother said she loved him too! *How could this be happening!?* How could mother betray me like this!?

"*Hey!*" I shouted at both of them. I could feel my face turning hot and red. "Let *go* of her!"

I was clenching my jaw as they both stared at me in utter confusion, still embracing each other in that hug. Finally, mother let go of the imposter and stepped towards me.

"Adam, you've been acting out all day," she said. "I'm not sure if you're just playing head games with me or what, but you're making this situation harder than it already is."

"What situation?" I asked, still fuming at both of them.

"The situation where we've been *stuck in this room* for over half a year!" she shouted at me. Her eyes began to swell up with tears. "Now, you get down on that floor right now, mister. We're going to bed."

The floor? Mother never makes me sleep on the floor. Was this a punishment for how I'd been behaving today? Because I feel my behavior has been justified.

"Why do I have to sleep on the floor?" I asked.

"It's Adam2's turn to sleep on the bed." I looked over at Adam2 and he stuck his tongue out at me. "You had it last night. Your brother gets it tonight."

"He's *not* my brother!" I screamed, clenching my fists and closing my eyes. Mother grabbed me by the ear and forced me down onto the ground. What was going on!? Mother was hurting me! Mother had never hurt me before. Even when I did act up, mother would sometimes yell at me but she has never hurt me!

"Not another word from you! You hear me!? Now, go to sleep!"

I lay on the floor in disbelief while Adam2 and mother got into the small bed. Mother tossed a corner of the blanket onto the floor for me. I used it as a pillow but it wasn't very comfortable.

"Mother?" I heard Adam2 ask. "Do you think they'll let us out of here, tomorrow?"

I heard her sigh. "I'm not sure, Adam2. I really hope so."

"Well, if not tomorrow, maybe the next day?"

I heard her sigh again. "If not tomorrow, maybe the next day. Now get some sleep."



**April 3rd**

I woke up the next day on the cold hard floor feeling aches and pains. I now had a pillow under my head. Mother was already awake so I guessed she must have propped it under there while I was still sleeping. I sat up to see Adam2 sitting in the exact same spot as yesterday, watching the TV. *Susie the Little Blue Coupe* was playing and although it was a cartoon, it wasn't very good. I was hoping that today when I woke up things would have gone back to normal. Nope. He was still here. At least this morning I didn't feel as shocked or confused as I did yesterday, although the feeling was still there. I stood up to see mother, once again, standing at the sink. She wasn't washing her hair this time but was just standing there. Eyes focused on the TV. She finally looked down at me and smiled.

"Good morning, Adam," she said. "Breakfast is in the corner of the room. It's likely cold already but it's bacon and eggs today! I know how much you love bacon."

Who doesn't love bacon?

I walked over to see that Adam2 must have already finished his breakfast as I didn't see his tray anywhere. He likely already slid it out of the slot. When I went to grab my tray from the corner I noticed two trays side by side.

"Did you not eat your breakfast?" I asked Adam2.

"Mmhmm," he nodded without taking his eyes off the TV.

"Mother, did you not eat your breakfast?" I asked her.

"You know I usually eat it before you boys wake up," she said.

"Okay," I said motioning towards the second tray. "Whose is this?"

Mother rolled her eyes. "It's your brother's, silly," she replied.

"No, I just asked him and he said he already ate his," I argued.

"Adam3" she said matter-of-factly, motioning towards the bed.

I looked at the bed and immediately felt the blood leaving my face. I must have looked white as a ghost.

There, under the covers, still asleep was another me. Another doppelganger. My mouth dropped open and I could feel my eyes beginning to bulge out of their sockets.

Mother stared at me for a moment with a look of concern on her face.

"Adam?" she asked. "Are you okay?"

I couldn't respond to her. I could barely breathe. I felt my entire body going numb. My brain... felt *broken*. The walls began to spin and I wasn't able to keep my balance. I could hear mother screaming my name as everything went black.



When I came to on the floor, there was mother, and two kids who looked exactly like me staring down at me.

"Adam!" mother shouted in a panic. "Adam, are you okay? Adam!"

I sat up.

"No, no, no, be careful, okay? You fainted," she said, cradling the back of my neck. "Are you okay, sweetheart?"

I couldn't take my eyes off these two imposters. They both had an equal look of concern on their faces. Like they actually didn't want me to get hurt.

"Here," she said standing me up and leading me towards the sink. She turned on the tap. "Get a drink."

I cupped my hands together and began gulping down water while mother stood there next to me. After a few big gulps, I looked over to see Adam2 and Adam3 still staring at me. That look of concern still plastered on their faces.

"Adam, are you okay?" one of them asked. I didn't know which one was which as they looked identical. I nodded my head.

"Yeah," I lied. "Yeah, I'll be okay."

"Take a seat on the bed, honey," mother said. "I'll get your breakfast."

"I'm not... I'm not really that hungry," I said. I truly wasn't. My stomach felt like it was in knots. I felt like I was about to throw up.

"You have to eat something, sweetie, you just fainted. It could be low blood sugar."

I had no idea what that meant but I nodded my head in agreement.



Up until lunch came, the other two Adams left me alone. They knew I was sick so they would each periodically check in on me, asking if I was okay. I would nod my head without looking up at either of them. I didn't want to see them. I didn't want them to exist. As much as I wanted a friend besides mother I didn't want *this*. I didn't ask for this. I wanted mother to remember when it was just her and I. She was the only one I could talk to when I was feeling sad or confused but I wasn't able to talk to her about this. She would think I was being silly. If I persisted, she would think I was sick or not right in the head.

I did have some questions for her though. Questions I never thought to ask in the past six months we'd been here. Although some of them were about my new "brothers."

"Mother?" I asked, patting the bed next to me; inviting her to sit down.

"Adam," she said quickly sitting next to me, grabbing my hand. She was clearly still very worried about me.

"The first day we were in here... I mean... you said we just woke up in here, right?"

"Yes," she said staring into my eyes.

"And we don't know who brought us here, or... why they brought us here, or even who they are?"

"That's right, sweetie," she said with a sad expression. "You already know all of this though."

"And when we got here," I continued, ignoring her last statement, "it was all four of us that woke up here?"

She nodded in agreement, still with that sad expression on her face.

"Where did we all live before this?" I asked.

"We lived in a big apartment with your father," she replied, clearly confused by my questioning.

"All of us?" I asked.

"What do you mean 'all of us?'" she retorted.

"Me and my two brothers," I stated.

"Of course, honey."

"And these are my only two brothers?" I asked with my head slightly tilted, motioning towards the other Adams. I could picture it already. Tomorrow when I woke up there would be another clone here. And the next day, another. Then another.

"These are your only two brothers," she stated. "But... sweetheart, these are very strange questions. You know you only have two brothers. Look," she said motioning towards the shelf they had installed in our room. "The little wooden apples were made by your father when you three were born. Don't you love that they actually let us keep them in here!? Each one represents one of you kids."

I looked over at the shelf to see three tiny apples made of wood. All were identical except for the numbers one, two, and three on each of them. All of them were spaced apart perfectly on the shelf. I was once again confused but not surprised. I thought we weren't allowed to keep anything in our room except this journal but she said it as if these apples had been in here with us the entire time. Much like she believed the other two Adams had been in here the entire time.

"Okay, and why did you name us all Adam?" I asked. Mother no longer appeared concerned with my questioning. She now appeared annoyed.

"Because..." she said, looking like she was trying to find the answer. I waited patiently for her to continue. "Because..." she repeated.

"Because why?" I asked.

She looked at me angrily for another moment, then her mouth curled up into a smile as if she was trying to forget the question. She ran her fingers through my hair and kissed me on the forehead.

"No more questions about this place, okay, sweetheart," she said as she stood up.



I noticed that at dinner time they put two trays through the slots at a time. When mother went over and grabbed them, two more would be slid in. The slot was only big enough for two trays. Now I was imagining five trays being slid through. Or six. Oh, man. Ten trays? Ten trays for ten people? There would be hardly any room in here! Where would we all sleep?

*Gone with the Wind* was playing again and I decided to sit with the two imposters on the floor while I ate my dinner. I'm not sure why. I guess I just wanted to try normalizing what was happening. One of them looked over at me and smiled.

"Are you feeling better now?" he asked. He seemed genuinely concerned. I nodded and continued eating, not even looking at the TV.

"Hey, Adam, when we're done eating, did you wanna play Rock, Paper, Scissors with us?" one of them asked. "That's if you're feeling up to it."

I smirked. Sure, I thought. Let's play a game where all three of us tie! No one wins, which means everyone loses! That sounds like a lot of fun.

"Sure," I said.

"You're soooo going down!" one of the Adams tauntingly said to the other. 

"No, you are!" the other spat back.

"No one is going to win," I said blandly.

The Adams looked at each other confused.

"No one will win the game," I repeated. "We're going to tie every time and there will be no winner."

The Adams just looked even more confused now.

"Watch," I said setting my tray on the floor, holding out my fist. The other Adams set their trays on the floor and held out their fists as well.

"Ready? Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!"

We all picked rock.

"Again," I said.

"Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!"

We all picked paper.

"Again," I said again.

"Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!"

We all picked rock again.

"Boys, no games while you're eating your dinner," Mother warned us.

I gave them a look that said 'I told you so.'

"I was so close to winning!" one of them said.

"*How!?*" I asked. "How were you close to winning? We all *literally tied!*"

The Adam looked at me thoughtfully.

"Well, I'll win the next game!" he boasted confidently.

"No. You won't," I mumbled under my breath.



After dinner, we did play more Rock, Paper, Scissors and just as I'd predicted, no one won a single round.

We played more of the Guessing Game too, but it's different with three people as opposed to two. The two Adams already knew how to play with three people as if they'd been playing for years, but I had to have the rules explained to me again. With three people, one person holds their hands behind their back holding up a certain amount of fingers while the other two have to guess how many fingers they're holding up by similarly putting their hands behind their back and holding up the same amount of fingers. Once the person reveals how many they were holding up, the other two reveal what their guess was.

First, it was three.

Then nine.

Then six.

Then seven.

Then one.

After every game, both Adams wanted to play again as if there was some chance they would eventually win. I was mesmerized that this was able to happen, but grew bored of it very quickly. Finally, I told them I was done playing and plopped my butt down on the floor to watch the TV.



A short while later the TV turned off and we all knew it was bedtime.

We did our nightly routine of washing up and brushing our teeth. I saw four toothbrushes stacked on the back of the sink now which did not surprise me. Tomorrow there would likely be five.

"Who gets to sleep in the bed tonight?" I asked mother.

She smiled at me. "It's your turn, Adam," she said. "Adam3 had it last night."

No, Adam2 had it last night, I thought. I definitely wasn't going to argue with her though.

The other Adams lay down on the floor next to the bed with zero complaints. It was as if they were expecting this. They didn't seem bothered by it at all.

I got into bed with mother and she pulled the blanket over us as she always does. I noticed she didn't lay a corner of it on the floor for either of the other Adams as she did for me last night.

I lay with my back to her staring at the tally marks on the wall. I counted them. One hundred and thirty-two. I counted them again. Still one hundred and thirty-two. Then, I had an idea.

"Mother?" I whispered to her without looking at her. "Can I make a mark on the wall?"

"What kind of mark?" she asked me.

"I want to draw a heart. A heart with the number three in it. The number three for your three kids."

She didn't say anything so I turned over to face her. She stared at me thoughtfully.

"That's a sweet gesture, sweetheart, but the paint is kinda hard to chip away at. Especially just using this bobby pin. Maybe we can do it in the morning?"

There was a reason it had to be done tonight. I wish I would have thought of this earlier.

"Please?" I pleaded with her. "It can be faint. I'll be really quick."

"Sweetie..."

"Please!" I pleaded again. "I promise I'll be quick. I just don't wanna forget to do it tomorrow," I lied.

Mother rolled her eyes. She reached up and took the bobby pin out of her hair handing it to me.

I turned over and began scratching a heart shape into the wall next to the tally marks. Mother was right. The paint was hard to scratch off. I was determined though so I put all of my strength into it. It wasn't a perfect-looking heart but you could tell it was a heart nonetheless. I then carved the number "3" inside the heart using straight lines. I rolled over and handed mother back her bobby pin as she examined my work.

"Three," I said to her. "Right now, you have three kids."

She looked at me with confusion in her eyes but was still smiling.

"Three wonderful kids," she said.

I put my hands on her cheeks and stared into her eyes. "Remember, okay? Three kids."

She chuckled. "I promise I won't forget my three kids," she said smiling again.

"*Only* three kids," I stated. I put a lot of emphasis on the "*only*."

"Okay," she said, chuckling again. "I promise I won't ever forget my *only* three kids."

This was a promise I was sure she wouldn't be able to keep.
