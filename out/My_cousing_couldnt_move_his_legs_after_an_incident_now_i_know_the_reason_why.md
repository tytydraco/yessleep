I went to the hospital to visit my cousin, he's been traumatized since the incident and he's not getting any progress. still screaming, sometimes he's just silent, always in the corner of his room. to be honest i really don't know what to do. i don't have even the slightest idea what happened on that particular day. 

i went in to see Dr. Charles Perez waiting for me in the hallway. 

"any news doc?" i asked

Dr. Charles replied, "it's been a few weeks now, and we're not seeing any progress at all. He's still doing the same things when he first came in here, he doesn't respond to our tests, only responses that we received from him are his screams." 

"is there anything i can do" asking desperately, you know it's really heart breaking for me to see him in this condition. we were really close since we were a child and he's always been a cheerful person, straightforward and always logical. 

" i highly recommend for you to speak with him, maybe if he remembers you, it'll trigger something and you might make him speak"

so without any questions i entered his room. i missed him so much, he's been here for almost a year now after that incident, i really need to hear from him the details so that i can justify everything that had happened. why did he almost light himself with gasoline? what could've been the reason for all of this ? 

" hey there bud. you doin alright ?"

i get no response, he's still in the corner, sitting and grabbing his feet while constantly rocking back and forth.

"Rudy it's me, jim. i came here to see you. "

this time i saw him look at me right in the eyes. his expression gradually changed from blank to terrified. then he muttered

"i-i cant move, i cant move, i cant move. "

"rudy relax, no need for you to stress yourself out, just calm down. don't force yourself "

he then now raised his voice "i can't move jim i can't fucking move. I CAN'T FUCKING MOVE!!"

he began screaming, the nurses rushed in to give him some medicine to calm down. 

now in a much calmer voice, he began to speak. "jim, please take care of my wife and kids. i know I'll be here for a long time.. really long time."

"what are you saying? " i asked. it seems to me that you're getting some progress now, the doctors said that they couldn't get any response from you. but now you can speak. just keep on looking at the bright side."

he replied "looking at the bright side is the least of my concerns now, jim. this all happened because of that fucking letter i got from asia. they told me i shouldn't read it, that i will suffer endlessly. but fucking curses are nothing but fantasies. at least that's what i thought at that time. and now i can't fucking move my feet. I'm terrified jim, I'm really really scared. they won't let me tell you."

i asked "they ?"
"oh my god, what have i done? i should have kept my mouth shut" 
he began screaming again, with all this medicine the nurses just gave him, he still screamed at the top of his lungs like he's about to be hit by a truck.

Dr charles advice that rudy needs some rest. i can ask my questions in my next visit. but still, i got curious about the letter that he's talking about. so i went to his house, and searched for that letter. when i opened his bag, the one that he used when he's travelling through asia, i immediately saw it. from the eerie feeling when i pulled out the letter, i was certain that this is it. 

i don't have any intentions of reading it. I'm not dumb and i know that this thing i'm currently holding is dangerous. i intended on burning it so that no one wont ever have to experience what rudy went through.

so i grabbed a lighter in the kitchen and i burned the letter.

i thought everything was over. how foolish i was to even touch that cursed thing. because the thing is, after that day i've been seeing that letter appearing in different places at my house. like it's following me. even though I'm sure i burnt it, it came back like nothing happened to it. i still recognize the same fold pattern, the yellowish color of the paper and its driving me crazy how that thing followed me everywhere i go. 

i ignored it but everytime it comes back, i am experiencing headaches, and i feel like a pressure was pressing down on my feet, the pressure is getting heavier and heavier each time i burn it or it comes back.
and by the end of the 6th month of my suffering. my feet were completely numb, i couldn't walk properly. 

its finally starting to get to me, it feels like its ordering me to read the letter. that its the only way this will end. i have to accept that i need to suffer what jim had experienced and endure everything that will happen after i read the letter. 

doctor prescribed medicines doesn't really help at all so on my 7th month i decided to finally read the letter. i can't take it anymore and i feel like i'm already experiencing what rudy went through. it couldn't have been more worse than this. how wrong was i to think that at that time.

i grabbed the damn letter and sat down. still hesitating, but i know this is the only way to end this so i opened the letter slowly. 

the letter only has 1 letter on it, and its the letter "O" but it has been written differently, like it has been written on the same point of the paper multiple times and when i saw that letter. i heard something terrifying. i heard laughter, it was a laughter of children but its different. it is loud and its deep. i tried to run but when i got up on my feet i realized i couldn't move my legs. that's when i saw it.

Opening that letter was the worst decision i ever made in my life. although currently i'm still alive right now. i know it's much better if i just ignored the letter forever. 

because what i saw that day shocked me and it traumatized me for the rest of my life.

two pale children are hugging my legs, but i doubt if they ever looked like children, they have a very white face and i couldn't see their eyes at all, like their eyes had been gouged and they're smiling, smiling as they know that they now have a new spirit to feed on.

 they always laugh when i scream, and it seems that every time i look at them they get even more terrifying. anyone will lose their sanity just by having a glimpse of them.

i am now currently in a hospital. and i'm still seeing them. now i get it why rudy couldn't move. with these demonic faces still clinging on my legs, nobody would be able to move.
