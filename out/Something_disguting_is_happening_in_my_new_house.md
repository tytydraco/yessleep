I just got a new house about a month ago. It’s a rental place. Unfortunately I can't afford to buy one yet, not in this market. But it’s not in the suburbs, which at first I thought was a plus. I live in the rural area on the outskirts of my town. Not another house for a good couple minutes by car. The house is 80 years old, and it’s small, roughly 1500 sqft. It’s a two bed and one bathroom. But just because it was built in the 40’s and relatively compact, doesn't mean it isn’t nice. The landlord had kept up on it really well; he told me he had to do a ton of renovations to it when he first bought it about a year ago and it shows. It basically hadn’t been touched since the first owners abandoned it 60ish years ago.

The landlord himself, we’ll call him Dan, was weird. When he gave me a tour of the house it was rushed and any question I had about the house, like how old it was or who the previous owners were or if it had any issues, was met by a quick, short-tempered answer, or he would dodge the question totally. But I didn’t mind having an awkward landlord as long as the house was nice.

The first day went without a hitch. I got a couple of my buddies, John and Jason, to help me move in; it was a good time. The first thing we set up was my TV so we could watch a game while we worked and we bought 2 six packs. It took a couple of hours but we were able to get everything out of the moving truck before sundown. 

When we were done, John had to leave to get back to his girl—remind me never to get married. But Jason and I decided it would be fun if we bought some more beers and had a little house warming party. This is where the weirdness kind of started. We both got in my car to go get some more beers and I went to twist the key. Nothing. The engine didn’t turn over. I didn’t remember leaving any lights on, but then again who does? Jason gave me some shit about it and he offered to use his car instead. So we did just that. 

After getting back from the nearest gas station, which was five minutes away, and walking back into the house we immediately felt something was off. It was extremely warm and humid—mind you this was in early October and it was getting cold and the air was dry. The house had also gained a faint mildew smell while we were gone, but it was so fleeting that we could only catch little whiffs of it here and there. I’m not saying it felt like a bread oven, but it was definitely warmer than it was before we left and we could feel the difference walking in from outside. I checked the thermostat and it hadn’t been on all day; the weather had been pretty mild so there was no need for it. Jason opened a window just to air it out. We chalked it up to just be the quirks of a new house and decided to just forget about it. I turned the heat on and we began our little party. Just some movies, snacks and beer. It was a good time.

I woke up around 3 in the morning with a splitting, alcohol-induced headache. Jason had slid off the couch and was asleep, ass up, on the floor. The TV was on but nothing was playing; it was on the blue input screen. The only other light on was the kitchen light and it was pretty dim. I grabbed a blanket off the couch and draped it over Jason’s drunk body. I decided I would go off to my own bed. I passed the kitchen and turned the light off when I heard something, a soft ruffling sound from behind me. I turned around to see, in the blue light of the TV, Jason’s blanket had been slid down all the way to his ankles but it didn’t look like he had moved at all. I stood there for a second, just staring. I was confused. But I wasn’t going to give something so simple any more thought. I went over to fix his blanket and had to cover my nose. “Jason, Jesus Christ,” I said. “What the hell did you eat?” The smell, I can only describe as the inside of a yard waste bin on a summer day. I honestly thought Jason had shat himself. But regardless, I covered him back up and went to bed.

I woke up to Jason nudging me awake. “Hey man,” he said; he sounded worried. “I can't find my keys. It’s almost 8:30 and I gotta be at work by 9.” I got up, still a little hungover and tried to help him find his keys. We looked everywhere, in the couch, under the rug, even in the fridge. By 8:45 he was stressing hard. “Man, I’m going to be late! Plus I gotta pee so bad.” I told him to go take a leak while I kept looking. I decided that if the most usual spots weren’t turning up the key, I would start looking in the unusual places for keys to be. I was just about to open the dishwasher when I heard Jason yell from the bathroom. “Bro what the fuck!” I hurried over and met him at the bathroom door. He was holding his keys in his hand and they were dripping wet.

“Oh my God where were they?” I asked. “I was about to piss when I saw them at the bottom of your toilet,” he laughed a little. “I must’ve gotten drunker than I thought last night bro.” We both laughed, but in the back of my head I wasn’t laughing. Something was off. Jason left soon after and I was stuck in my new house with a dead car.

I went back to the bathroom, just to look around. I’m not sure what I was looking to find, but I just had a feeling there was no way Jason or I accidentally dropped his keys in the toilet; we weren’t blackout drunk. I lifted the toilet seat and gasped in disgust. The room was immediately filled with a vile odor. A thick black substance was oozing out from the rim jets and into the water. The smell was like rotting vegetables. I lifted the tank lid, and nothing—the water was clear. I called my landlord and told him about it, but he didn’t sound surprised at all, almost like he was expecting me to call him with some weird shit. He made some half-hearted excuse about the toilet being the one thing he didn’t replace when he renovated, and that there was probably some gunk stuck in the rim jets. He told me just to flush it a couple times and it should be okay. 

Jason returned later after his shift to jump my car. I hopped in and as Jason was lifting the hood up, about to connect the jumper cables, I had the intrusive thought to just try turning it over. I stuck the key into the ignition and twisted. The engine roared to life as though it hadn’t been dead in the first place and I could scarcely hear Jason’s “Whao,,what the hell?” over the sound. He came around to the driver's side and leaned against the car. “Well, looks like ya don’t need me afterall.”  

“I guess not,” I said, dumbfounded. After he left I was alone for the rest of the week. But the rest of the day went normal; in fact the rest of the week went pretty normal. But the next Saturday, that was a different story. 

I was home all day Saturday, but not by choice. I woke up really early for some reason, well before the sun was up, and wanted to go get some breakfast at the ol’ Micky D’s. I didn’t even change out of my night clothes, just got shoes on and headed out into the crisp autumn morning air. Got into my car and went to turn it over. But again, like last time, nothing, not even the ticking of the ignition. Frustrated, I got out and lifted the hood, using my phone as a light.  My face was immediately blasted with warm humid air and the smell of compost. I nearly gagged, it was so unexpected I recoiled and the hood slammed back shut. At this point I was convinced some animal had gotten caught up in the engine and died. . That evening I invited Jason back over, both to look at my car and also just to have some company. We had steaks and more beers, and after dinner we both looked at my car again. He had no idea what was wrong with it, but he bought into the idea that maybe something had died in it and told me to get a mechanic to look at it. I was pissed but I knew there wasn’t really anything either of us could do.

Ole Miss was playing against Washington State that night so I invited him to stay over again for the game and drinks. After the game was over, we were both drunk and tired so he passed out on the couch and I went to my room. I woke up around 3 again, this time not because of a headache, but a sound. I’m a light sleeper so it isn’t uncommon for me to be stirred awake by little sounds. But this sound concerned me. It was the sound of heavy footsteps on the wood floor. I sat up, and my heart began to race as the slow deliberate steps got evermore close to my room. “Jason,” I said, like a kid calling for his mom, “is that you?” 

The steps got closer and louder until they stopped at my door. Then, nothing—silence. I fought the urge to hide under my blanket. I gathered my courage and said, “Hello?”. The footsteps began again, this time in a run. I froze, closed my eyes and hid under my blanket like a child, not ready for whatever was about to happen. The thundering steps ran right up to me then stopped again. There was a long moment of deafening silence.

It was then that I remembered that I had no wood floors. That smell, the putrid one from the toilet filled my nose. I pulled my blanket down slowly to see a trail of black oozing footprints on my ceiling, as if the ceiling was leaking the substance in the shape of bootprints. They led right over my head. My blanket was covered in drops of smelly, black slime. I was too petrified to move. Then right above my head, a dark matter began to form and seep from the drywall above me. The puddle accumulated; it bled through like ink through paper, until it took the form of a man. Then, the specter leapt down on top of me, pinning me down to the bed. It gripped my wrists tight, holding them down on the mattress, covering me in the foul sludge. I wriggled, I fought and kicked. The figure atop me mimicked every move I made, even my attempts of shaking my head trying to avoid its dripping ooze, but never loosened its grip. I opened my mouth to scream and the figure opened its own, mimicking me. From it's gaping jaws vomited a fountain of thick dark mucus into my esophagus. I woke up gasping. 

I shot up in my bed and nearly bolted, but the figure was gone. I took a breath of relief, “Only a dream,” I thought to myself. I turned my lamp on and immediately gasped. My wrists, they were red and chapped, like I had been bound with duct tape. The horrors weren’t over. I hardly had time to observe my wounds when from the living room I heard Jason screaming. I jumped out of bed and ran out to see the living room in an absolute mess. The couch turned upside down, plates, bowls and utensils from the kitchen broken and strewn all over the floor, cabinets open. I was in shock—how did I not hear any of the chaos? And what happened to Jason? But the most shocking, and disgusting part, was the puddle of black putrid sludge in the middle of my living room and the trail of bare footprints leading to my open back door.
