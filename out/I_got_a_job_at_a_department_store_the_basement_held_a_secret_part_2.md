Monday evening I arrived at the store at 7 pm. It was spring and the sun was out late. Just as I parked and stepped out the old sodium lights in the parking lot buzzed and clicked as they turned on for the night. I walked up to the store and the sliding doors swished open as I entered. Tom was waiting for me. “Ready for your first night?” “As ready as I can be”. “good.. well we have nobody to train you but it's a simple enough job you'll get the hang of it. If you have any questions call my house phone also Eric will be in the security office if you have any other questions he can help you alright?” He gave me a pat on the shoulder and exited the store. I watched as he got into his truck and drove off. 

I pulled out one of the papers I had received with my instructions and began my procedure. I went and shut off and locked the automatic doors, armed the security system, turned off the escalators to the second floor and dimmed the non essential lights. I then went about tidying the store. It honestly wasn't dirty or anything at all. It looked like nobody had even shopped here today. Even the bathrooms were squeaky clean. I went up to the second floor and walked down the electronics aisle just kind of exploring the store. The stock definitely hadn't changed either.you know those stores that keep items on the shelf until they sell? Yeah this is one of those. There were lots of obsolete items on the shelves here. A cassette boom box still in its original 90s packaging that was so faded you could barely make out what it was, a coin sorter with the faded packaging as well and many other things. How the heck is this store making any money? I thought. 

I walked past the giant single glass window on the second floor. I stopped and looked out into the dark woods around us. Apart from the parking lot lights it was pitch black out there. You couldn't even see the lights from Hillsdale from here. This place really was isolated as heck I thought. I then decided to head down to the basement. I hit the call button on the elevator and when the door dinged and opened I stepped in. The doors closed and I began my descent to the basement. When the doors opened I stepped out and began walking down the hallway. When I saw those blood red double doors I felt drawn to them. What could be in there that's so secretive. A room full of gold? Expensive jewelry? Who knows. The thought tore at me. I walked up to them. 

And when I did something in my mind screamed at me not to even touch them. The doors each had a frosted glass window on them so you couldn't even see inside. There was a keypad next to the door that required a code to get in. Shit I thought. Guess I'm not getting in. I turned around and decided to go see what was going on in the security office. I went in and Eric was sitting at the desk. He turned around when he saw me “hey hows the job fittin ya?” He said. “Oh not bad pretty boring honestly but it's work” I said “yeah can't complain to much. The pay is great for around here” he said  “so what's up with this secret red door at the end of the hallway? Some kind of room full of gold or something?” I asked . His tone changed and he got a bit more serious but not aggressive “I'll be honest with you..I been here for 7 years but I have no idea whats in it. Whatever is it's a big secret…I've seen lots of important looking people dressed in science gear and suits going in and out during the early mornings usually twice a week. I've heard some strange sounds from there but whatever it is it must be dangerous or something.. Even Mr rhansohoff isn't allowed in there … at least from what he told me… well I've probably said to much already but just keep yer nose out of it… you don't want to end up like the last guy that worked your job” he said. “Why what happened?” I asked. “He started getting nosey. Somehow he bypassed the keypad using the computer at my desk here and unlocked the door. When he saw what was inside some men in suits dragged him back in that room when he tried to run away. 

He never came back out. His social media accounts mysteriously disappeared the next day and I couldn't even find anything about him on the Internet except an obituary stating he had a heart attack and died…utter bullshit.. I know they did something to him but I'm not going to get into it “ he said. I stood there a bit unnerved by this for a minute and decided I wouldn't even think about those red doors. The next few weeks went by fine. Until one Thursday night I happened to look out the front doors late at night. As I stated at the black tree line suddenly red dots appeared all along the treeline. I couldn't tell what they were. 

So I went and grabbed a pair of dusty binoculars from one of the aisles in the store and ran back to the door to get a better look. What I saw..were the silhouettes of what appeared to be overly large wolves .. but they were larger than wolves… and with glowing red eyes. This terrified me. There has to be at least a hundred of them along the treeline. Yep no way was I going outside. I remembered the rules and double checked the front door was locked before going into the basement and locking myself in the break room for the rest of my shift. When morning came and my shift ended I unlocked the door and exited the building as the day crew walked past me and to the building. The sun was just coming up and I ran to my car and peeled out of there.on the way home I thought about last night. Wolves? In Hillsdale Michigan? Yeah no way. Unless it was a pack of coyotes maybe. But they were way too large.

 They were about the size of a Pyrenees and if you've ever seen one they are absolutely massive dogs .I arrived home and ate breakfast before showering and climbing in bed. I fell asleep still thinking about those things I saw the image burned into my head. I sure as heck had a nightmare about it. In the nightmare a pack of giant vicious muscular black wolves slowly crept up to the storefront and broke through the glass window. They jumped on top of me knocking me down and I expected them to eat me alive.but instead the wolf on top of me started to speak in a deep raspy gruff voice “please help us we need you” it said . After a haze of other dreams I awoke to the sound of my alarm clock. 3:30 pm. Well better get up and ready for work again . I hit the snooze button and slowly got out of bed
