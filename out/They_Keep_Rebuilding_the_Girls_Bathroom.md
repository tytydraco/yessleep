So yeah, they had redone the girls’ bathroom. Again.

  


That made three times this semester. Maybe four, if you counted the week it smelled like cherry disinfectant and despair.

  


This time it was teal.

  


Like, aggressively teal. The kind of teal that’s trying to convince you it’s calm, while actually plotting your death.

  


Everything was sleek and too clean.

  


The stalls were metal now — polished, glossy, smooth like they’d been peeled from a spaceship.

  


Even the trash cans were different. Touchless. Covered. Modest.

  


It was giving: “sanitized emotional crisis.”

  


I walked in and immediately stopped in the doorway.

  


It wasn’t just the color—it was the layout.

  


There were five stalls now. Not four.

  


And the third one—the one with the sticky door that used to wheeze like a dying animal—was gone.

  


That stall had history, okay?

  


Someone once scratched a full phone number into the door and wrote “Hot for bio teachers only” under it in pink glitter pen.

  


I found a used condom on the floor in there sophomore year and had an actual spiritual awakening.

  


There were three tally marks inside the doorframe labeled “blowies,” and someone had Sharpied a giant “cry here, slut” above the toilet paper dispenser.

  


Every time you flushed, it made a wheezing noise like a haunted saxophone. It was disgusting.

  


It was ours.

  


And now it was gone. Wiped like it never happened.

  


I blinked. Then blinked again, dramatically.

  


“This place got a BBL or what?” I said, just loud enough to make the lip-gloss girls at the mirror twitch.

  


Angela was brushing her hair.

  


Perfect part, glitter roots. Like nothing was weird. Like the room hadn’t changed its bones overnight.

  


“Are we not gonna talk about the renovations?” I asked, leaning next to her, watching her face in the mirror instead of mine.

  


She didn’t stop brushing. Just said,

  


“You’re not supposed to notice.”

  


Then she smiled like she hadn’t just said the creepiest thing in the universe.

  


Like it was normal. Like she was reading a Buzzfeed listicle about haunted stairwells and not… living in one.

  


I laughed it off, obviously. I wasn’t about to be the girl who freaked out over bathroom tiles. I had a reputation.

  


(“Unbothered but hot” was a brand, okay?)

  


Still. When I went into the last stall, I could feel it.

  


The air was different. Too quiet. Like a silence that was trying not to breathe.

  


I locked the door. Sat down. And that was when I saw it.

  


Someone had written DO NOT CRY on the back of the stall in this insane, shifting color.

  


It was like… red if red had a panic attack. Not quite purple. Not quite blood.

  


My brain kept trying to name it and failed.

  


I leaned closer. The letters rippled slightly, like they were sweating.

  


They hadn’t been there yesterday.

  


I had been in this stall yesterday. I remembered the gum stuck under the toilet paper dispenser.

  


The chipped tile with dried pink lip gloss smeared into the grout.

  


The cigarette burn by the hook — someone had stubbed one out on the plastic.

  


Now?

  


Spotless.

  


Sterile.

  


Unreal.

  


I flushed.

  


Washed my hands.

  


Didn’t look at the mirror on the way out.

  


The janitor was in the hallway again. Same mop. Same blank face.

  


I stepped out slow, swaying my hips just enough to make it obvious.

  


I fixed my lip gloss in the reflection of the window.

  


Tossed him a lazy “fuck me” look like it was a dare — or a curse.

  


Like if you’re gonna watch, then watch, sweetie.

  


His eyes followed me like he didn’t have a choice.

  


And just before I turned the corner, I heard something from inside the bathroom.

  


Like a voice.

  


Faint. Wet. Muffled behind the tiles.

  


Crying.

  


I kept walking.

  


But I didn’t put my headphones in.

  


Mostly because I wanted to see if anyone else had heard it.

  


The crying.

  


No one even looked up.

  


I passed three girls giggling over a phone, someone vaping behind the trophy case, and a teacher who said “good morning” like it was still September.

  


Everything was normal.

  


Except it wasn’t.

  


Because I knew that sound.

  


That ugly, hiccupping, snot-dripping type of crying.

  


Like a dying rat in eyeliner.

  


So I turned around.

  


Obviously.

  


I wasn’t gonna not check.

  


I mean—

  


What if it was interesting?

  


I slipped back into the bathroom.

  


And there she was.

  


Lexi.

  


Slutty little trainwreck Lexi.

  


Crop top barely covering anything, bra strap twisted, mascara halfway down her cheeks like war paint.

  


She looked like a Bratz doll in a hurricane.

  


She was hunched over the sink, clutching her phone like it owed her something, sobbing so hard it echoed.

  


I stood there for a second.

  


Arms crossed.

  


“…You good?” I asked.

  


She flinched like I’d slapped her.

  


Then she turned.

  


Eyes red.

  


Lip gloss smeared.

  


Tits basically out.

  


“Fuck you,” she spat. “Leave me alone.”

  


And she stormed into the second stall.

  


Didn’t slam it.

  


Just shut it real soft.

  


Like she was trying not to fall apart too loud.

  


I stood there another second.

  


Then scoffed.

  


“Whatever.”

  


And left.

  


She wanted to cry alone? Fine.

  


Let her rot in seafoam and shame.

  


On my way out, I tossed the janitor another look.

  


Something between fuck me and fuck you.

  


He stared.

  


Didn’t blink.

  


Loser.

  


The next morning, I came to school feeling hot.

  


Like hair-was-still-curled-from-yesterday hot.

  


Like I might bully someone by accident hot.

  


You suffer for the look. That’s the rule.

  


Saw that bitch Marissa wearing my exact shade of gloss but somehow looking like she licked a fryer.

  


Saw Coach Valdez in cargo shorts again — literally why.

  


Saw Ethan making out with that girl who always smells like popcorn.

  


Tragic.

  


Walked the hall like a runway.

  


People looked.

  


They always do.

  


Then I passed Lexi’s locker.

  


And froze.

  


Because it was empty.

  


Not messy.

  


Not trashed.

  


Not covered in glitter or bitchy Sharpie quotes like “suck it, Mr. K .”

  


Just gone.

  


Like Lexi never leaned against that locker in her crop top, pretending to cry so people would ask what was wrong.



No Juicy Couture sticker.

  


No empty perfume roller.

  


No scrunchie with blonde strands stuck in the elastic.

  


No smell of vanilla vape and body spray war crimes.

  


Just metal.

  


Silent.

  


Clean in a way that felt wrong.

  


Like the hallway was lying.

  


“She transferred,” someone said behind me.

  


Right.

  


Sure.

  


Because girls like Lexi totally just transfer in the middle of the week without posting about it, crying about it, or threatening to burn something on the way out.

  


Bull. Shit.





I told myself I just needed to check my makeup.

  


Even though it hadn’t smudged.

  


Even though I was wearing setting spray.

  


Even though I knew exactly which stall I was walking back to.

  


But when I got there, the bathroom was different again.

  


I could tell before I even opened the door.

  


But this time, it wasn’t just cleaner.

  


It had an edge.

  


The soft teal walls were gone — replaced with glossy black tile and chrome fixtures that looked stolen from a rap video set.

  


The mirror had a heavy metal frame now.

  


The lights above it buzzed harder, harsher.

  


And on the stall door?

  


Graffiti.

  


Real graffiti — not the cute little “u wish u were me” scribbles girls used to Sharpie on the hand dryers.

  


This was thick black spray paint, slashed across the metal like a warning.

  


NO TEARS IN THE SYSTEM

  


Block letters.

  


All caps.

  


Still smelled fresh.

  


The bathroom looked like it had been redesigned by someone angry.

  


Someone who wanted to cover grief in basslines and brick.

  


But I could still feel it underneath.

  


The sadness.

  


The rot.

  


Like the tile was just makeup over a bruise.

  


I opened the second stall — Lexi’s stall.

  


Inside was spotless.

  


Not just clean —

blank.

  


Like no one had ever been in it.

  


Like I hadn’t stood outside that exact door yesterday while Lexi sobbed and told me to fuck off.

  


Like the air itself didn’t remember her.

  


But I did.





I started thinking.

  


Not just in the way you scroll through old stories looking for drama.

  


Not gossip-thinking.

  


Real thinking.

  


Like my brain was catching up to something my bones already knew.

  


And suddenly, I saw them.

  


Tiny Tina

  


Pink tile days.

  


Always wore pink Converse, split-dye hair, cat stickers on her locker.

  


She had a girlfriend who cheated on her with a bio teacher’s daughter.

  


I found her in the first stall, crying so hard she couldn’t breathe.

  


Two days later?

  


Not expelled.

  


Not dropped out.

  


Gone.

  


Her locker emptied itself like a magic trick.

  


Even the sticker residue was gone.

  


Then there was June 

  


“Clove Girl.”

  


Renovation 2. Pale yellow.

  


She was quiet goth, not hot goth

  


Shaved eyebrows. Always smelled like clove gum.

  


Read tarot in the cafeteria and made boys nervous.

  


I caught her crying into her hoodie sleeve.

  


Didn’t ask why.

  


Didn’t care.

  


Next morning?

  


“Locker reassignment.”

  


No announcement.

  


No goodbye.

  


And then…

  


Lexi.

  


Seafoam.

  


Meltdown.

  


Fuck-you energy and mascara trails.

  


I saw her cry.

  


I saw her break.

  


And now black tile.

  


Chrome everything.

  


A bathroom that looked like a wannabe rapper’s wet dream.

  


It was pretending to be cool.

  


Hard.

  


But I knew.

  


I knew.

  


Every time someone really cried in here —

  


cried like their chest was collapsing —

  


They disappeared.

  


The school didn’t talk about it.

  


The teachers didn’t notice.

  


The girls whispered for a day, then forgot.

  


But the bathroom remembered.

  


It kept their echoes.

  


And changed its face.

  


New tiles.

  


New smell.

  


New lighting.

  


Like it was dressing up in different skins.

  


Trying to be anything but what it was:

  


A grave.

  


I backed away from the wall.

  


My chest was tight.

  


My hands were shaking.



Nina.

  


Gone.

  


June.

  


Vanished.

  


Lexi.

  


Not even a rumor left.

  


They all cried.

  


Here.

  


In this bathroom.

  


And then they vanished.

  


The stall changed.

  


The lights shifted.

  


The school pretended it never happened.

  


I shoved the stall door open and ran.

  


Out into the hall.

  


My legs unsteady.

  


My breath short.

  


And there he was.

  


Mop boy.

  


Janitor.

  


Whatever he was.

  


Standing there like he’d never left.

  


I stumbled toward him.

  


“You know,” I said.

  


“You fucking know.”

  


He didn’t move.

  


“What is going on with this bathroom?”

  


My voice cracked.

  


Too loud.

  


“Why do you guys keep changing it?”

  


He stared.

  


Silent.

  


“And the girls—what about the girls who cried? Where do they go?”

  


I felt my fists clench.

  


Tried to breathe.

  


“First it was Nina. Then June. Now Lexi. And no one says anything. You just repaint the stalls and act like they were never here.”

  


He looked me right in the eyes.

  


Like he was reading a countdown.

  


“You don’t want to hear them, do you?”

  


“What?” I whispered.

  


I felt my stomach drop.

  


“You don’t want to hear them.”

  


Like he was offering me an out.

  


Or a warning.

  


Like silence was safer.

  


And then he turned away.

  


Back to his mop.

  


Like I didn’t matter.

  


I went back into the bathroom.



Because I had to.

  


Because part of me still didn’t believe it.

  


The lights above the mirror buzzed like bugs.

  


The air was warm.

  


Still.

  


Wrong.



I stepped in.

  


Closed the door behind me.



And then—



The voices began.



At first it was just a trickle.

  


A soft sound under the pipes.

  


But it rose.

  


Like floodwater.

  


“Please.”

  


“Get me out.”

  


“I didn’t mean it.”

  


Lexi.

  


And more.

  


So many more.

  


I pressed my back to the stall door.

  


The voices were behind the mirror.

  


Inside the walls.

  


In the floor.

  


June. Nina. Girls I didn’t even know.

  


All crying.

  


Begging.

  


And I couldn’t move.

  


I tried to hold it in.

  


Tried so hard.

  


But my body was shaking.

  


My throat clenched.

  


And then—

  


I broke.

  


I dropped to my knees.

  


And I cried.

  


Real, full, gut-deep sobbing.

  


Tears hot on my cheeks.

  


Snot running.

  


No control.

  


No stopping.

  


I didn’t cry like a girl with an image.

  


I cried like someone falling apart.





And then it hit me.

  


I had cried.

  


Here.

  


Just like them.

  


The final box checked.

  


No going back.

  


And the bathroom was listening.

  


The air changed.

  


Heavier.

  


Hotter.

  


Like it had been waiting for me to break.

  


Like it could breathe now.

  


And I—

  


I collapsed.

  


Fully.

  


Palms against the tile.

  


Forehead to the floor.

  


My knees hurt.

  


My ribs ached.

  


But I couldn’t stop.

  


The sobs came from somewhere deep.





Ugly sounds.

  


No rhythm.

  


Just noise and spit and shaking.

  


I tried to grab the edge of the sink to stand up, but I missed.

  


My hand hit the floor and just stayed there.

  


I couldn’t move.

  


I didn’t want to.

  


Something in me was leaking out.

  


And I didn’t know if I could put it back in.

  


Mascara stung my eyes.

  


My gloss was gone.

  


My hoodie was soaked.

  


My face felt naked.





And the voices kept whispering.

  


So soft now.

  


Almost gentle.

  


Like they were welcoming me in.

  


“It’s okay.”

  


“You’re one of us.”

  


“We cried too.”

  


I shook my head.

  


“No,” I said.

  


But it came out broken.

  


I covered my mouth.

  


And just sat there.

  


Alone.

  


On the bathroom floor.

  


Where pretty girls disappeared.

  


The whispers went quiet.

  


Like someone had turned them off.

  


The air didn’t get lighter.

  


It got heavier.

  


Like something had settled.

  


And I wasn’t alone.

  


I felt it before I saw him.

  


Shoes.

  


Old, beat-up black ones.

  


Scuffed at the toe.

  


Standing a few feet from me.

  


The mop leaning beside him like a staff.

  


I didn’t look up right away.

  


Couldn’t.

  


I was still on the floor.

  


Hands on cold tile.

  


Face flushed.

  


I felt disgusting.

  


Exposed.

  


But I could feel his stare on me.

  


Warm, but not kind.

  


Tired.

  


Like he’d seen this before.

  


Maybe been this before.

  


I finally lifted my head.

  


He was just standing there.

  


Watching me.

  


Expression soft, like he was waiting for me to figure something out.

  


“I don’t want to disappear,” I whispered.

  


It came out hoarse.

  


I didn’t know if I was saying it to him,

  


or to the floor,

  


or to whatever was behind the walls.

  


But he heard.

  


And he nodded.

  


Just once.

  


Then he crouched.

  


Slow.

  


Set the mop down in front of me.

  


The handle bumped my fingers.

  


And he said—

  


“You weren’t supposed to understand.”

  


“They don’t like when someone understands.”

  


I stared at the mop.

  


The worn grip.

  


The frayed ends.

  


The water dripping onto the tile.

  


He looked at me like he wanted to say more.

  


But didn’t.

  


He stood.

  


Walked to the door.

  


Didn’t even look back.

  


Just said:

  


“It has to be someone.”

  


And then he was gone.

  


The door clicked shut behind him.

  


The next morning, I woke up before my alarm.

  


Got dressed.

  


Did my hair.

  


Put on gloss I don’t remember buying.

  


Went to school.

  


The halls were cold.

  


Too quiet.

  


People stared.

  


Not in a you look hot way.

  


In a who is that way.

  


Angela passed me without saying hi.

  


Ethan didn’t even glance up.

  


I passed my old locker.

  


Glitter stickers.

  


Cracked mirror.

  


Sharpie quote: “cry here, then reapply.”

  


Now it’s just silver.

  


Blank.

  


Like no one ever slammed it shut in heels.

  


Like I was never there.

  


I kept walking.

  


Down the hall.

  


Toward the bathroom.

  


My hands moved on their own.

  


When I got there, I opened the door.

  


The lights buzzed.

  


The tile gleamed.

  


There was a bucket.

  


A mop.

  


Waiting.

  


I started cleaning.

  


Girls passed behind me, whispering.

  


One of them asked,

  


“Who is that?”

  


Another shrugged.

  


“No idea.”

  


And I kept scrubbing.

  


Because that’s what you do.

  


You clean.

  


You don’t ask.

  


You don’t cry.
