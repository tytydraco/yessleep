My wife, Sarah, and I needed a break, so we booked a cabin in the Tennessee mountains for a week. It was nestled on a ridge, surrounded by dense pines that seemed to swallow the place whole. The other cabins nearby felt miles away, and ours sat back, shrouded in shadow. The cabin’s windows glinted like eyes, and I felt a prickle on my neck, like we were being sized up.

Inside, it was cozy enough—wood-paneled walls, a stone fireplace, a plush couch. But the bedroom stopped me cold. Every wall was plastered with mirrors, the large full body mirrors, lined up against every wall. They reflected each other endlessly, creating a maze of our own faces staring back. I’ve always had this irrational fear of mirrors, like they’re doorways to something else. Portals. Sarah teased me about it, but I could tell she felt uneasy too. “Who needs this many mirrors?” she muttered, forcing a laugh.

We were exhausted from the drive, so we ordered pizza, sprawled on the couch, and tried to ignore the bedroom. But when it was time for bed, my stomach knotted. The king-sized bed was luxurious, but those mirrors… they pressed in from every angle, catching every flicker of moonlight. I felt exposed, like countless eyes were watching from the glass. Sarah fell asleep quickly, but I lay there, heart pounding, unable to shake the sense that something was staring back.

Around 2 a.m., I gave up and crept to the couch. The living room was darker, but my eyes kept darting to the hallway leading to the bedroom. There, on the wall, hung a rusted chain—some old decor, maybe from mining days. It was swinging. Not wildly, but slow, deliberate, like a pendulum. I tried to rationalize it—maybe the ceiling fan was on. I checked. The fan was off. No AC, no heat, no draft. The air was still, heavy with dread. As I approached, the chain stopped dead, like it knew I was watching. My skin crawled.

I sank onto the couch, pulling a blanket over my head like a scared kid. The dread was suffocating, a weight on my chest that made every breath feel stolen. I don’t know when I drifted off, but I woke to grey light filtering through the windows. Sarah was already up, perched on an armchair, her face pale. “I didn’t sleep great,” she admitted. “This place feels... off” We chalked it up to first-night jitters and headed out for breakfast, a museum, and some shopping. The daylight helped, but as we drove back to the cabin, that heavy dread slithered back, thicker than before. The trees seemed to lean in, and the cabin’s windows gleamed like they were waiting.

We grilled hot dogs for dinner and slipped into the hot tub out back, hoping to shake the unease. The water was warm, but the air felt colder now, sharp against my skin. Then we heard it—footsteps inside the cabin. Heavy, deliberate thuds, followed by a faint *tap-tap-tap*, like fingernails on glass. Sarah’s eyes widened. “Did you hear that?” she whispered. I nodded, heart racing. We cut the hot tub short. I went in first, checking every room, every closet. Windows locked, doors secure, nothing out of place. But the air felt charged, like a storm was brewing inside.

Sarah admitted the cabin was freaking her out, especially sleeping alone last night. I felt guilty but promised to try the bedroom again. That night, I climbed into bed, the mirrors looming like black voids in the dark. The dread was unbearable, a physical weight pressing my ribs. I knew the chain was swinging in the hallway—I could hear its faint *clink-clink* over Sarah’s breathing. I stared at the mirror by the jacuzzi tub, and my blood turned to ice. A figure stood there. A man, impossibly tall, his silhouette black as pitch, edges blurring into the glass. No face, just a void where one should be.

I gasped, fumbling for my phone’s flashlight. The beam lit the room—nothing. Sarah stirred. “What’s wrong?” she mumbled. “I thought I heard an animal on the porch,” I lied, my voice shaking. I couldn’t scare her. “Gonna watch TV for a bit.” In the hallway, the chain was swinging again, slow and taunting, stopping when I glared at it. I sank onto the couch, facing away from the bedroom, but the feeling of eyes on me was relentless. My neck hairs stood up, and the air grew colder, like something was breathing down my spine.

I was drifting off, fighting to keep my eyes open, when I saw him again. The tall man, standing in the bedroom doorway, motionless. Just a shadow, but heavier, like he was absorbing the light. I blinked, and he was gone. The dread was crushing now, my chest tight, breaths shallow. I had to check on Sarah. She was still asleep, undisturbed. But as I turned back, I froze. In the living room mirror, there were fresh markings, like someone had clawed the mirror. I stumbled back, heart hammering. I closed my eyes, telling myself it wasn't real, and when I opened them, the claw marks were gone

Sarah woke then, stumbling into the living room, her face ashen. “I keep dreaming of a tall man,” she whispered. “He’s staring at me through the mirrors, smiling with these… rotting teeth.” We couldn’t take it anymore. We made a bed on the floor, Sarah clinging to me as she fell asleep. I kept watch, staring at the bedroom doorway. The air grew colder, the feeling of dread growing heavier. I had to face it. I crept into the bedroom, and there he was—in the mirror by the window. The tall man’s shadow now had a face: pale as bone, eyes black pits, a grin of jagged, rotting teeth. He began to laugh—a deep, inhuman, menacing laugh. 

I squeezed my eyes shut, praying, begging for it to stop. The laugh grew louder, vibrating in my bones. Behind me, the chain swung wildly. Sarah screamed from the living room, “We need to go! Now!” We flipped on every light, packed in a frenzy, and tore out of there. Sarah drove, her knuckles white on the wheel. I kept glancing back, expecting that grey face in the window, those hollow eyes. Nothing. But the dread didn’t lift. It clung to me, heavy as ever.

We’re home now, but something’s wrong. Last night, I caught a glimpse of my reflection in the bathroom mirror—and for a split second, there were claw marks that were faint on the glass. Sarah’s been waking up screaming, saying she feels eyes on her, even here. And sometimes, late at night, I hear it—a faint *clink-clink* from the hallway, like a chain swinging. Did we leave that cabin behind… or did something follow us home?

Has anyone else stayed in a place like this? What do we do if it’s still with us?
