I just recently turned 21 years old and i go to a nearby college.Most of the people going there live in these apartments right next to the college campus including me.I mainly moved into them because my grandma lived down the street. These apartments aren’t rinky dink apartments they are very nice with a living room and kitchen downstairs and then two bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. Still a little small tho. 

Anyways to the story. It all started Sunday when i went for a walk around the apartment plaza area. There were tons of kids playing and even swimming in the pool. I sat on a bench with my earbuds in just in my own world. There was a girl who looked about my age walking towards my area. She was holding 3 textbooks. She looked stressed? As she walked past me she tripped on a tree root that had come out the ground. She fell. “Shit!” she said. I paused my music and got up to help her. She had strawberry blonde hair that smelt amazing. She also had dark brown eyes and freckles. 

“I’m so sorry” she said. “that’s no problem, are you okay?” I asked her. “yea” i got in response. “You know your very pretty” she said. “Aw ur so sweet thank you!” That’s when our friendship started. We went to the same college and we like the same stuff. She even told me she’s getting a schedule change soon and will be in Mr.Johns class with me soon. Funny, I never told her i was in the class. She must’ve just saw me walk in there one time.

 Her name was Kacy and she had a boyfriend named Navean. I had never met him though . They lived two block away from my grandma. It had been months now of being friends and she texted me one sunday afternoon and asked if i could come over and help her study for the exam in Mr.Jhons class.  

When I went over to her house Navean was sleeping on the couch right by where we were studying. He was facing away from me. “Sorry he’s just taking a nap, he’s a really deep sleeper though.” “Oh yea that’s fine” I said. I set my keys down on the table in between me and Kacy. “So kacy what do you want to start with?” “Oh what about cells?” “Omg yes i’ve been to confused with those lat-. 

“Who are you” Navean said. “Oh my god i’m so sorry he sleep talks.” “Oh that’s fine.” “Ok so i’ve been all those up and I kind of have a hard tim telling-“ Kacy was interrupted. “Don’t come in here.” “Wtf” I said. “Oh shit sorry so times they can be creepy.” “Is he having a nightmare?” I asked. “Idk he never really remembers his dreams” she said. “nooo” “It’s not what it seems” I chucked a little bit. “It’s kinda freaky.” I said “Yea i’m sorry” Kacy apologized “Don’t worry its okay.” “Anyways I’m kinda having a hard time telling the lab pictures apart of the cells apart so I was thinking-. “

“Theres a boot, It’s hidden.” “Run to the sun.” “RUN!” I gasped “Omg I am so sorry hold on let me get a cold towel to put on his forehead the usually wakes him up.” She said getting up. She walked away around the corner. “Amira.” He said no facing me still asleep. “How do you know my name?” “She doesn’t want to study.” “Taken anatomy 5 times.” “5 Women.” He said “Are you awake?” I whispered to him. “Run to your grandmas house down the street.”He said “How the fuck do you know about my aunt?” I asked in shock. “Your keys are already missing.” I look over to the table and he was right they were gone. “I know i set them there when I go here” I thought to myself. “Go out the window before she gets back.” “Wont hurt me when i sleep.” “Your running out time” He said “Your running out of time” He said louder. I was sweating. 

“Are you okay?” I heard Kacy voice in her friendly voice she always has. I jumped. “She was standing there with the towel. “Yeah” She laughed “What did he say?” I didn’t answer, I glanced over at him. Still sleeping. Her voice dropped low. “What did he say Amira.”
