A glimpse of pale skin, black hair, and eyes that burned with malevolence. I saw it in my peripheral vision – always just out of sight. My mind screamed warnings: *Don’t look! *
But I did. Once.
That night, I woke up screaming, sheets drenched in sweat. The face haunted my dreams ever since.
Then the fans started making strange noises – low hums that sounded like whispers. My bedroom window fan would slow down, as if listening to me breathe. I’d try to shake awake, thinking it was just a nightmare lingering. But I wasn’t asleep.
Fear became my constant companion. I’d lie awake, eyes wide, waiting for... something. The face, darkness, some terror that lurked just beyond perception.
My mind began to unravel. Memories blurred – what was real, what was nightmare? Hallucinations intensified: shadows moved on walls, footsteps creaked down empty hallways.
One evening, while staring at the clock (3:47 AM – my mind recorded every detail), I realized:
 *I wasn’t afraid of something coming for me...*
 *I was afraid of becoming what I fear*
My reflection stared back – eyes sunken, skin pale. The face I dreaded was... mine.
In that moment, the fans stopped whispering. Darkness closed in. And I screamed – my voice identical to the whispers that haunted me.

My mind splintered like shattered glass. Reality distorted, reflections lied. I barely recognized myself – eyes sunken, skin pale as the face I dreaded. Days blurred together in a haze of fear and paranoia. Constantly arguing with myself over what was real. Every night the fan would whisper my deepest fears, echoing my thoughts perfectly. When I look at myself in the mirror each morning things would change, started simple with shadows around my eyes, it progressed daily. Eyes black as coal one morning, my skin so gray it was almost white. The most recent disturbs me the most: my lips curled into the most sinister smile you can imagine.
The clocks seemed to spin backwards in these moments, forcing my memories to overlap. I relived conversations with myself that haven’t happened yet? Already happened? What was happening, am I just going insane or is there something else? Trying to worm its way in through my confusion, fear, and what feels like the beginnings of despair. My reflection seemed to leer, as if saying: “Yes, you are.”


My reflection’s sinister grin haunted me. I felt myself slipping – mind fragmenting, identity unraveling. I caught glimpses of... something moving beside me. Always just out of sight. A shadowy arm reaching for the door handle, a dark silhouette mirroring my own movements. The eyes, MY eyes, staring back from behind me. Was this madness manifest or something slowly merging with my soul? I heard my own voice – but not my thoughts – whispering:
“We’re the same.
Always were.
Just taking control now.”
My heart raced as I realized: I was arguing with myself – but which one is me? Suddenly, I faced my mirror image again. This time it spoke out aloud:
“I’m the one who’s always been awake while you slept.
I’m the face you feared.
I’m home now.”

My mirror image’s words slammed into me like ice water:
“I’m home now.”
It stepped closer, our reflections merging – two faces became one. I felt my mind surrendering, identity dissolving like sand between fingers. The room distorted, colors bleeding into darkness. Fans screamed my name.
I WAS BEING CONSUMED.
In this chaotic terror, glimpses of my life flashed before my eyes. I could hear childhood laughter and see some of my loved one’s smiles. Every fearful moment has led to this surrender. My voice – now *OUR* voice – whispered farewell:
“The fear was me all along.
I was the darkness waiting.
And now, I am you.”
Vision faded to black. When light returned, I stood alone – yet not alone. My eyes, once bright, were now black as coal. My skin, pale as the face I feared.
I HAD BECOME HORROR.

Police found my apartment empty – except for a single word scrawled on the mirror:
“MINE”
