I was definitely followed home from the airport. I was tailed very obviously, like whoever was following me wanted it known. The car sat parked on my block overnight. It’s only just left and that’s why I began getting this next post ready. I didn’t go investigate further, I just locked my doors and windows. Jack and I are meeting up later today, but honestly it may be smart not to if someone is following me. Following us? I was too scared to mention it over the phone, so I’ll confer with him when I can. Until then, here is the first few journal entries, as promised:

…



February 18th, 2025



I met Captain Downes early this morning. We were going to be flying to a small Military Base in New Zealand where we’d be taken to the research vessel offshore. The trip was uneventful for the most part. As for our operation, I was briefed before we made our way over to the helipad. It was next to a small, nondescript building about 45 minutes off-road from a town just outside the city.



I was brought into a room with six other people. Myself, Captain Downes, two broad shouldered men who introduced themselves as Ray and Dan, a shorter woman named Jen who gave me an endearing smile, but carried herself like that of a leader, and a skinny young man who came over and shook my hand, carrying a nervous energy while stumbling over his own name, James. 



We were all standing around for maybe five minutes before the door to the room swung open. In walked an older, silver haired man wearing a military uniform adorned with more ribbons and accolades than I had ever seen before. I recognized the four stars as those of a high-ranking General. Downes, Ray, and Jen all stood at attention and saluted him when he walked in. I had spent so much time out of the military at this point that it was no longer instinct, but I followed suit with the others after a momentary delay.



“At ease.” The man said in a commanding voice without breaking stride. He flipped a light switch and a projector screen slowly rolled down from the ceiling. “You’ve all been chosen to be here by Captain Downes for a special operation you’ve all been briefly informed of.” Because some of you are civilian, and those former and currently enlisted don’t have the official clearances for what you’re about to be shown, none of this is on the books.” I figured as much already.



“You’ll be divided into two teams. Onsite and topside. You’ve all been given parceled information based on your specific directives. As far as what we know…” The man clicked a button on a remote and an image of a sonar scan popped up. It was a mapped section of seabed littered with out of place structures. “We’re investigating large electromagnetic field anomalies associated with a sunken pre-war weapons testing site. I will not be answering questions regarding the background of the location. The environment is hostile and unforgiving, which is why these are the best divers the Navy has to offer.” Dan, Ray, and Jen both stood there and nodded once quietly, exhibiting a reassuring confidence in themselves. 



The general clicked ahead to another screen. This time, underwater footage that was formatted differently than the one Captain showed me in the diner. It was clearer, and had no static interruptions. The depth gauge and display information was also different. More detailed. There were temperature, pressure, and salinity readings, as well as a miniature radar on the bottom left corner. As the depth changed, darkness enveloped the forward facing flashlight beam more and more. Eventually, once the gauge reached 10,000ft, the salinity readings dropped to near zero levels, and the pressure dropped to that which would be expected at only a few hundred feet.



“This underwater canyon that the site was buried into ended up preserving the site. Apparently at the depth the canyon begins, its like the whole thing is like a big freshwater lake. The testing done at the site had effects that… lingered… once it was destroyed.”



The footage playing on screen changed from blackness to an outline of a house. Standing semi-upright. Debris could be seen floating around inside the broken windows as the camera zoomed into the structure. The perspective then zoomed out and panned a bit further to the side. Two other houses stood among a wreckage of broken rocks, concrete, and mangled car parts. There were mannequin limbs floating as lifelessly as they once stood. The camera did a full three-hundred and sixty degree turn, showing the leftover foundation of a house as its structure sat mangled next to it, and a canyon wall was littered with out-of place materials, pieces of rooftops and walls, all suburban. The whole thing was eerie. Something about man-made structures this deep underwater seemed so out of place. I noticed there was no mention of the shadow I had seen in the video in the diner. Something told me not to ask.

The screen switched again to a paused video. It was an underwater infrared view of the testing site. Because there was no heat that far down, there was pretty much nothing to make out on the screen, and the main structures were scarcely outlined for reference by a whatever computer program was being used.

“This is what we need to stop.” He said, playing the video. He continued. “Once we got on site, we set up deep sea cameras as well as more environmental markers to have a clear map of the area. Every day since they’ve been set up, these abnormalities have been appearing. They’re at the same exact times as the highest readings of the electromagnetic field spikes.”

The screen quickly showed a succession of three quick flashes in different spots around the structures. The video played again in slow-motion. The flashes appeared fast and then disappeared, only lasting for a second longer than before. They seemed to look like slits in the screen followed by a bright flash.



“And thats all we got.” The general said, flipping the lights back on and retracting the screen back up. “You’ll be briefed with more specifics for your individual roles once we get on board the vessel. The first dive is scheduled in 48 hours. You’ll all answer to Captain Downes from here on out. He’ll have a direct line to me.”



“Thank you General Howard.” Captain Downes responded. Howard walked out of the room without skipping a beat. “Get yourselves together and meet outside at the helipad.” Captain said. We were ushered outside and given small containers. I could tell they were heavy duty Faraday Cages. Basically containers that can protect electronics from incoming electromagnetic fields. “All personal electronic devices are to be placed in these cases.” He came around and pulled out a lock for each of our containers. A marine stepped out of the helicopter and over toward us. He picked up each of our containers, labeled our names on them, and stowed them in the back of the helicopter.

February 19th, 2025



Today was uneventful. The helicopter dropped us off late last night on the deck of a huge aircraft carrier that had been anchored off the port side of the research vessel. There were a few small coast guard boats there at the time as well, but they were gone by this morning, probably to refuel. In what would be an otherwise mundane journal entry, there was something of note. Once we were transported from the carrier to the research vessel, we were escorted around the ship. It was a repurposed cargo freighter fully modernized with the most up to date technology. We were introduced to the workers from MaritimeX as well, who seemed to all be “guarded.” 



Wherever one of the employees from the company were, there were armed guards stationed nearby. They were being given all their normal freedoms, and supplies were brought in daily with each worker able to submit their own personalized shopping lists. There was only one rule they had to follow that the others didn’t. A strict sort of “curfew.” All MaritimeX employees were to stay inside after sunset. No going out on deck unless on assignment and escorted by armed personnel. It was oddly specific, but for the life of me I can’t understand why. Thats not what I’m paid to figure out though. If theres one thing I’ve told myself based on how Captain Downes was in the diner that night, its to keep my head down and stay in my lane.

…



Alright. I’m going to stop the journal entries here for now because Jack called me saying he had something urgent to tell me. He’s on his way over now so I’ll come back and finish up this post so I can let you know what happens.



…



Jack was followed home from the airport last night too. He didn’t need any more convincing to keep investigating this further with me. We were in too deep whether we liked it or not. “What couldn’t you say over the phone?” I asked him, the anticipation building to an all time high at this point. “I woke up this morning and booted on my computer. Before I could do anything, a chatroom window opened unprompted. I couldn’t control it. A message typed out: STOP LOOKING. Before I could do anything my whole screen froze. I tried keyboard inputs to reboot the PC, but nothing worked. The screen went black and the computer turned off. Hasn’t been able to turn back on since.” His worlds felt icy. “What do we do?” He then asked me nervously. I didn’t know how to reply. I don’t right now. I’m going to end the post for today here. I’ll post the next journal pages tomorrow, and update accordingly.
