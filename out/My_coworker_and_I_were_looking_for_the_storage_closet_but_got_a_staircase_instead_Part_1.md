[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jrrrmb/my_coworker_and_i_were_looking_for_the_storage/)



I don’t think I’ve told anyone this story actually. My partner has been pushing me to now that we're trying to find these people, but I thought I'd only have to relive this in my dreams. I hope none of you ever find one of the doors, for everyone's sake.

I was 22. The fast-food life wasn't the way I had imagined I’d spend my time on this Earth, but there I was on the way back to the golden arches after the sixth 7-1 am shift that pay period. My apron hadn’t been washed and I was ready to throw in the towel- though that was the same thing I thought the night before and the day before that. I couldn’t have quit even if I’d wanted to. It was my only income, and I had rent to pay.

I’d always thought that the best parts of the job were the drives in and out. Not because I didn’t want to be there, which I didn’t, but because on the way in I’d usually catch a glimpse of the sunset. The yellow and red sign was an eyesore against the moody rainbow that made up most evenings, but it was fitting.

The way back home was always nice too, but more so because there were no people on the road, and that meant I could drive faster than 55. We were a little out of the way from any real towns, so it wasn’t like anyone would notice or care anyway. I hadn’t gotten pulled over up until then at least.

Once I had made it to my destination I finally parked, gathered my things, and went in, smacked by the smell of cooking oil and salt. The place was where I’d always imagined diets and clean eating came to die, not where I’d be spending my 20s. Regardless of how I felt though, people wanted their burgers, and I was only there to flip them.

“Adrian?” A voice piped up from behind the register. My partner for the night. “Hey! No rush, but get your apron on and come out, there’s gonna be some changes to the shift tonight.”

I flattened my hand in a salute as I walked past her.

My coworker, Catherine, was the same age as me. Somehow, she’d climbed the ranks in a short time and had recently been promoted to overnight shift lead. The woman must’ve worked more hours than anyone in this place, and she pulled a lot of extra weight, but she was basically guaranteed to never get a managerial role. Despite that though, she’d always managed to make people look forward to coming in, myself included.

She was 5’5” max and had a mess of dirty blonde hair that was always tied up and back into a bun, probably for food safety reasons. She was well-liked. Whoever worked while she was around normally had nothing but nice things to say. However, when there were bad days, they were bad. When she got angry with us, she always had a cold stare. One that read ‘do better’ without her so much as opening her mouth. She wasn’t afraid to put her foot down and let whoever was around know she’d been disappointed. Luckily, I haven’t been one of the people she’d done that to, and I planned on keeping it that way for as long as I could.

At the time I was super into her, though I hadn’t mustered up the courage to ask her out yet. I’d been working on it. She had a kind of air about her that made her unapproachable- to me. We’d hung out together a few times before, with other people we worked with. At that point, I’d thought my attempts at flirting had been getting through to her, but I never really had mustered up the chest hair to get it done.

The salute was all I could manage.

I made my way to the break room, taking in a breath of old fry oil and mildew. There were a few lockers and chairs next to a table that adorned the back corner of the space. It wasn’t very large, but neither was the team who used it. We’d been about 10 people max, not counting those who were being paid a salary. Administration, representatives, and the like.

It took all of 5 minutes to shove my belongings into an empty locker and throw on my apron. “Cathy?” I called as I walked out. There was no one in the restaurant at this point, so it wasn’t like anyone would mind hearing whatever she needed to tell me. “What’d you need?”

“Don’t forget to punch in.” Her voice fell flat. I had.

“Shit, let me do that quick.”

“Please do,” she called after me “you’ll be my favorite!”

From the punch box I couldn’t help but let out a laugh. It hadn’t sounded like she was joking. Part of me suddenly felt a little proud for coming into such good fortune.

I made my way back over with a smile. She really knew how to make a guy giddy. “So, what’s up?”

With her attention on the register, she answered. “Gary, the new hire. You remember him?”

I wracked my brain. Gary? “Yeah… yeah I remember him.”

I did not.

Catherine finally looked up at me. It’d been a look that reminded me of one my parents would use when they knew I was lying. They gave it to me hoping I’d fess up, but I was never very good at coming clean, as it appeared Cathy was newly learning. She sighed. “Well, he called in this afternoon to let us know that he would be quitting.”

“Damn, really? How long has he even been here?” At the time I didn’t blame the guy, but that was pretty low. He should’ve at least handed in a 2-week notice or something.

“This would’ve been his second shift I think.”

I took note: Gary was an asshole. “So why did I need to know that?”

I seemed to catch her off guard with that question as she didn’t answer me right away. Her gaze became soft, she pressed a finger to her lips, and it was over for me. I’d probably been supposed to help her think of the point, but I’d already wandered far beyond the arches. My thoughts raced; she was looking right at me. I caught her eyes, those pools of brown and green seemed to dance together in a way that made my chest light. Man, thinking on it now, I was a poet thinking of all the things I could say to her in that moment.

“Right...” she stammered, throwing a hand to her head that immediately reversed the spell her eyes had cast. The same hand was then thrown up above her head, and she sported a newfound look of remembrance. “Right! It’s just going to be us until 1. So, because Gary was a dick and didn’t show, we’re going to have to pull some extra weight.”

I groaned, which seemed to make Cathy smile. “Oh no! Stuck here alone with you? How will I ever survive?”

“Shut up and get to the grill please, I think I just heard the headset beep.” She shoved me playfully. There hadn’t been any beep if my memory serves me, but it did seem like my humor had rubbed off on her.  As she turned her attention back to our register and counting the till I went into the kitchen.

With only two people in the store, it isn’t hard to imagine that the night would be a drag. However, for whatever reason this night dragged on so unbelievably long that Catherine and I were almost forced to talk to each other out of sheer boredom. The once soothing sound of dirty, dripping oil was now as oppressive as bombshells. I thought we were surely in for the longest 8-hour shift ever recorded. There weren’t many customers either, which was always a given with the night shift. I had made 5 or 6 meals max by the time 3 hours had dripped away. I just wanted to flip something.

To kill time, I tried to strike up another conversation as I scraped the grill. I figured that if I got her talking about something interesting or important it would start a conversation that would last us to at least midnight.

“So,” I started “got any plans this weekend? Isn't it Memorial Day Weekend or something?”

“I was invited to Dylan’s again, but I’m not sure I’ll show. Were you going?”

“Seriously? No, I wasn't even invited."

I heard a laugh. "Well yeah, when you get so drunk you pass out in someone's flower bed it makes sense that you weren't invited again."

"Everyone makes mistakes. Whatever, screw that. You aren't going anyway so who else would I bother?"

"I guess no one."

There was silence as I recalled and scrubbed the memory of waking up to a bunch of angry party-goers and an even angrier mom. "So, Hanging out with family then?”

“What? No.”

“What are you doing then?”

Her gaze didn’t leave the register as she counted the till for what felt like the thousandth time. However, after my comment, she stopped. When she spoke again, her voice dripped with strict caution. “Why?”

This caught me by surprise. “Well, I just…” It was my moment. I hadn’t expected this to be when or how I asked her, but it was the chance I was being given. “I was wondering if you’d have time to go out for some coffee or something.”

When she didn’t immediately reply I panicked. “But I understand if you’ll be busy. I know you work like every day and… yeah.”

I gave up and was embarrassed by the sound of laughter. I felt my cheeks warm up. As if she could read my mind, she answered. “I’m sorry,” she turned to me, and I saw a smile had grown from her lips. “I don’t mean to sound like I’m laughing at you- I’m not.”

I breathed a sigh, feeling as if I could melt at her feet. Her eyes searched me as I tried to find the right next words. “So... coffee?”

“Just us?"

I nodded, saying anything else here could be detrimental to the outcome.

"This weekend?"

Another nod.

She seemed to think on it, still scanning my person, and pursed her lips. “Maybe, if I can and make it work with my shifts.”

It wasn’t a no, and I felt at that moment like I could flip 700 patties at once. Euphoria didn’t begin to cover the feeling that washed over me. I welcomed it, happy with this outcome.

“Oh actually,” her attention had turned to another area of the store “there’s something we have to do before I forget. You remember where the supply closet is right?”

“Yeah, but I’m not usually the one who goes in there.”

“Unfortunately, we both will be now that we’re the only people and Gary quit before doing the job for me. We gotta more cleaner for the floor. I don’t think anyone’s mopped today and it’s disgusting back here.”

I didn’t say anything, but I didn’t think anyone had mopped in at least a few weeks. Catherine did a lot of things; that was not typically one of those things. It was surprising she just noticed then, and I began to wonder how upset she’d be when the mop inevitably revealed the weeks of built-up dirt and grease. Thank God it wasn’t supposed to be my job either. I was safe from whatever lecture I figured would surely follow. I wish, more than anything, that dirt was the most alarming thing about that night.

“Alright,” she clasped her hands together almost excitedly, which I found funny “let’s get it moving then, I’ll turn the closed sign on for a little while. No one’s coming anyway.”

She’d been right, the people in our area at the time weren’t prone to coming in the late-night hours, but our regional manager had decided we’d be a 24-hour store regardless. Any sales were good sales I guessed, even if there weren’t too many. It was 10 pm, we’d probably get things situated before someone accidentally came through the drive-thru and realized the sign was on.

The supply closet was next to the break room down the same hall I’d taken when I got in. Letting Catherine get ahead of me, I followed her down to the small door. She fished out a ring of keys and sighed.

“Something wrong?” I asked, though something in my gut told me I already knew.

“Nah, just fine,” there was jingling as she continued “I wanted these keys labeled, but it looks like no one fucking did it.”

“Oh.”

“Yeah, well when no one can figure out what key unlocks the employee bathroom I’m sure that’ll change.”

I turned my head gingerly. Those were the kinds of things that went on at our location. We barely were in the green with sales, and no one was prone to taking time to do extra work. Everyone was keen on doing what was outlined when they were being trained and nothing more. We were constantly hard-pressed to find anyone who would do things they weren’t getting bonus money to do. No one, other than probably Catherine, was going to take the time and label the keys knowing it wasn’t going to get them any extra cash.

Before I knew it the door lock had clicked open, and Catherine let out a less irritated huff. “There we go. I’ll have to get this key remade but at least the door is open for now.”

“What’s wrong with the key?”

Spinning around, Catherine greeted me with the key she'd used to get the door unlocked. It was green and brown, with a rougher texture than the rest of the ones on the hoop. It had seemed as though someone left it around and waited for it to look like an antique before using it in the store. Why hadn’t they cleaned it ever or made a newer, nicer copy? Probably because the people there were lazy. I shook my head of the thought and grabbed past Catherine, landing on the door handle. I remember how cold it’d been. It caused me to pause, uneasy, but I shook my head clear of the feeling easily. I should have listened to my gut.

Upon opening the door, I was met with something I’d never seen in the storage closet before.

There was a staircase leading down.

“That’s a lot of remodeling. I’m surprised I didn’t notice this before.” I joked, nudging Catherine, but when she didn’t say a word, I glanced over to find her stunned to silence. She was stiff. “What’s wrong?”

“I just… this… the closet isn’t supposed to be like this.”

After a moment, I began laughing. I figured she knew I didn’t go in here often and was now trying to pull one over on me. I was honestly a little hurt by this. Surely I seemed smarter than that.

“That was really funny, but seriously, when did the guys add this in?”

She didn’t laugh with me as she stared down the stairs, so I nudged her in a way that hopefully read as ‘Cool joke! You don’t have to keep up the bit!’. “Guess I’ll just have to ask them when they- “

“They didn’t!” Her voice cracked, my breath caught and I continued my fit.

“I was just in here a few days ago, this can’t be new." I heard her say eventually. "They would’ve told me.”

Now I was getting confused. I cocked my head, laughter dying. I gathered eventually that we must’ve both been out of the loop with whatever renovations were being done here, so I tried to offer her solace.

“Once we grab the cleaner or whatever we can lock the door and ask admin tomorrow. Sound good?” She didn't reply, just nodded, keeping her eyes on the door. I wasn't sure what else to do to break her from the trance, so I turned my head too, gazing down into the dim light. There was nothing to fix my sight on, and the longer the silence went on, the longer I found myself making up crazy ideas for what could be down there.  Sure, it was probably just a dingy basement, but I thought it would be way cooler as some secret lab or drug cellar.

“Want me to go down first?” I found myself asking after a brief time. I wasn't ever one to care about getting back to my work, but we weren't going to be able to just stand around all night staring into nothing.

Catherine spun to face me, grabbing my hand. Her grip was firm enough to not come loose as I pulled back. “You want to go down? I have no idea if it’s even safe or finished. I can’t believe they didn’t tell me they were adding this in! What if there’s asbestos? I heard you can fuck up your lungs if you breathe in that stuff. Did we even need this?”

“Cathy.” I took a deep breath, stopping her rambling. “Everything is gonna be fine. We just gotta deal with this for now. If it makes you feel better, I’ll walk down and let you know if it’s finished yet- okay? No need for you to go down there if there’s raw shit floating around.”

As if my words had brought her anxiety down, she nodded and barely mustered up a smile. Letting go of my hand, we stepped back from one another.

“I’m sorry,” she put a hand up, gesturing to me as the other went to cover her eyes “I don’t know why I freaked out so bad. I think the doubles are catching up to me. It'd be nuts for the guys to put this in and just not tell anyone. I probably missed a memo or something.” I nodded. Taking a step toward the stairs, I took note of the poor job the owners had done.

They went down at least 15 feet, which felt wholly unnecessary for a fast food joint in the middle of nowhere, but I wasn’t paying for it so why did I care? At the landing the hall made a sharp left, obscuring my vision of the rest of the basement, which wasn’t great to begin with as the only light sources seemed to be oil lamps starting at around 5 feet in. I turned to Cathy for a moment, but once I saw her face I turned back and started walking down. She'd been staring down again, past me.
