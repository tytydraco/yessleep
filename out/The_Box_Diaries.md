There is little light that gets through the crack that rests unseen in the old wood behind me. If I move my shoulders forward and uncomfortably crane my neck  upward, stretching my eyes toward the low ceiling, I can see it. A small hair of bright light, it's presence a promise that there is a world beyond this box. That outside of my kneeling position there is people, there is life. It alone gives me hope.

The light wasn't always there, my box was lifted and moved sometime ago, and although I can't hear anything, I like to think it's soft glow is from daylight. I stare at the light, drink in its crooked shape the same way an alcholic does his liquer. I stare until the stiff muscles in my neck strain, eventually my head dips, and I have to move my shoulders back to the position they were in previously.  My mind races. 

The light is mockingly sitting on my back. It knows I know it is there. Knows how I rely on it. Knows that I need its light. In the dark I began to weep. I don't know how long I was in here, I stopped shouting for help some time ago. I can't feel my legs anymore and my hands have become these unfathomable creatures that scuttle in the darkness at the end of my tired arms. I do not speak. It is better to believe that the silence is my choice.

Then it hits me. A spark of brillance that threw mad colours into my mind's eye. The crack. It was a crack. Although my best attempts at breaking the heavy wood around me were futile, that crack might be a weak point in which I can exploit. I stim excitedly, bouncing upon the sensationless calves beneath me, my hands flaying wildly in the dark, like uncaught nightmares. The idea, like  rolling snow, grows, and brings me another idea, but also a realisation. When I break into the light, into that natural light I will be able to be heard, I will be able to scream, to thank God I will be able to stretch outward, greedily to my full height. The notion makes me smile and bounce once more. And the realisation that I haven't heard my captor in what must have been days only excites me further.

I lean forward painfully, feeling my lower back arch against the rough wood, the muscles in my back stretching tightly as I do so. I go to slide my arm backward, along my side. My elbow soon hits the wood and I cannot turn my arm to reach it. I begin to weep.

Raising my arm to the ceiling so that my elbow may push against it, I try and pivot my forearm over my head and behind me, leaning my face forward, I can smell the far side of the box. It was there that that golden hair reappeared. A strand of Rapunzel that promised me salavation. Awkardly dipping one shoulder forward so that I could manevour my quickly tiring arm to blindly search for the crack, I stared at the light, waiting for it to disappear so that it's location may be revealed. Pressing, patting and waving along the wall, I felt my shoulders strain.

The fear of failing brought my bladder to my attention. I always felt like pissing when I was anxious. The teacher used to tell me that when I was in school. "Boys like you find it hard to hold on" I heard his voice as my frustration grew and I began to angerily flail my hand about. 

"I can't find it" I mumbled out the side of my deformed mouth.

"I can't find it"
"I can't find it"
"I can't find it"

"You can't get out you fucking idiot" a gruff voice inside my head shouted. As if by way of response my bladder released a slowly spreadind warmth about my thighs. 

In absolute defeat I hit the wall behind me. 
"Of course you couldn't find it" I thought in that same gruff voice "You could never have found it".

I hit the wall again. And noticed the light, its golden strand of hope and gone. I slowly lifted my hand, and watched as the sun- coloured hope revealed itself once more. I felt myself begin to bounce, wafting the stench of urine into my mouth and nose. I hit the spot in the wall again, and watched in delight as the light once more disappeared. I hit it again and again. When excitement had finally left me, I set about beginng to finger the crack, hoping I might press against the sides and remove more.

My finger pushed against it and to my delight. I felt the wood give way. The crack of light was now the width of a wire, it almost seemed like a greedy abundance that I could see so much light. It was at this time that I had to maneuver my arm back over my head and allow it to flop lazily and defeated against my urine soaked thighs. The skin felt sticky and unclean when the two collided. I brought my head back and rested in darkness before I tried to repeat my labour with my other arm.

I'm smart. Teacher always said that. I saved my strong arm for this moment, hoping that now that the crack had been widened I could find it easier, and now using my dominant hand, I might break even more of a hole into my ebony prision. When I had once again located the crack, I pressed my finger against it and pushed. I felt the wood give way and splinters fall away. The wire-thin light that was project ahead of me was as thick as a colouring book now. I continued to work at it until my hand became tired.

I didn't want to give up. Teacher always said that giving up is only giving up on yourself. So I jammed my finger into the hole, only squiriming slightly as the splinters defended themselves. Once it was clear my finger could go no further, and my knuckles lay pressed against the wood, I brought my head up so that it rested awkwardly against my wrist. The light was gone once more.

"It's okay" I told myself. I leaned forward once again, and forcefully slammed the back of my head  into my wrist, driving my hand further into the wood. Warm blood ran along my finger and down and my arm, tickling me slightly.

"It's okay" I repeated through tears, bringing my head forward before snapping my neck back violently. My wrist absorbed the impact poorly but drove my hand deeper into the hole.

I hammered my hand into the hole twice more before I could feel air against my bloodied and twitching finger. I only stopped because my wrist felt numb and broken. Withdrawing my hand from the crack, I brought my arm back to its natural position. The light against the far wall was wide enough to pass a tennis ball through. 

"I can't stop now" i said, my voice beaten and quivering. I once again employed my other hand, bringing it gingerly to the position my other hand had been in just moments before. I rested my head against the wrist and thought of the outside, of all the light I could see, of the freedom, of all of the joy I could once again see. I could tell teacher that I listened to him, that I heard him in my head and that I listened in order to break free. I felt my the cool air on my finger and just as I was craning my neck forward to slam it back, a horrendous pain erupted from my finger.

I screamed loudly and brought my hand back into the box. In the light I seen that my finger was gone, as was the top of one of my knuckles, in its place was a small fleshy stump, oozing bright red blood onto my naked thighs. I screamed and screamed, I was scared. 

Then a gruff voice spoke "Didn't I tell you can't get out of there you fucking idiot" 

A squeked relief of an office chair came from somewhere outside the box, as if a great weight had hauled itself upright. Through my screams, I heard the thuds of heavy boots come closer to the hole in the box. With a small click, he turned off the light, and I was once again in darkness.
