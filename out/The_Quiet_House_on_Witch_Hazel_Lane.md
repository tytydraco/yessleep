An odd serenity often lingers in the air in the wake of violence. Morbid as it may be, I have always found a sort of peace in the various ambient sounds present at such scenes and learned to appreciate the poetic absurdity of their persistence. The sound of a trickling faucet left running by a woman now dead on the kitchen floor, the hollow tones of a wind chime hung from a rafter just as its owner had done to himself -- near flawless juxtapositions that might have drew the envy of the Old Masters themselves had they witnessed them. Fittingly, just as an artist might use different shades for aesthetic means, they are not only useful for that purpose and can be used to tell a story, to draw focus to an overarching theme that could not be easily gleaned without their consideration.

Of the countless scenes I have been called to over the years, there was one where this rule did not apply.



My phone rang around 11:40 pm that night. Sergeant Jim Nichols had been flagged down by a group of three shaken boys who reported that they had found a body in the abandoned house at 215 Witch Hazel Ln. The youngest of the three had been dared to go into the residence and wave at the remaining two from a second story window. Once on the second floor, he found the body and ran down to tell his pals. The boys were taken to the station and their parents were called in order to obtain statements while Nichols and three others went to the address where they found a decomposing body in one of the second story closets. 

Hanging up the phone, I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and put on a pot of coffee while I dressed for what would likely be a long night. 

The gravel drive was fairly short but it wound through the trees in such a manner that it seemed much longer than it was. At the end rose a decrepit, two story home that had been long since abandoned. It was surrounded by ancient oaks constricted by vines which intertwined obstructing any view of the property from beyond the perimeter. The front of the structure was fitted with a sagging and rotten porch whose roof bore much of the same qualities while unintelligible graffiti adorned the exterior in places accentuating the chipping paint, broken windows, and all other derelict qualities of the once beautiful home. The only sources of illumination that night emitted from the headlights and rotating blues of the patrol cars which had carried Nichols and the others to the scene earlier that evening.

I exited my car placing my flashlight in the back pocket of my pants and hung my camera around my neck before approaching the trio. The two younger officers appeared a bit shaken which was to be expected, but it was the unease I detected on Nichols' grizzled face that gave me some concern. Jim was a seasoned veteran who had responded to some of the more gruesome scenes I had been a part of and never showed a ounce of trepidation. Telling the others to remain at the cars, Jim motioned for me to follow him to the front of the residence as he glanced at the half open front door. 



"Something's not right here, Teddy..." he said once we were out of earshot of the patrolmen.



"Foul play?" a asked with an inquisitive look.



"Dunno... It's something about this place. Its like it plays tricks with you."



I let out a breathy chuckle "Halloween was two weeks ago, Jim. Maybe its a case of residual spooks?"



He didn't laugh.



"I'm not playin' around here, Teddy. Something's off. Not sure how to explain it, but..." he trailed off seeming to try and form a coherent explanation.



Confusion and concern were what I was feeling in the moment but the combination of the two states must have manifested themselves in an impatient or mocking expression.



"... You think this is fuckin' funny?" Jim snapped.



"Easy... Alright, I'll cut the shit." I said raising my hands in surrender. I nodded to the door. "Let's take a look."

Removing flashlight from my pocket, I clicked it on and trained the amber beam at the doorway and began to make my way towards it, Jim hesitantly trailing behind.

I didn't expect there to be any overt noises in such a house given its abandoned state, but one would imagine the sounds of creaking floors or rafters, or the faint sounds of rats clawing about in the walls, but there was nothing. Once I crossed the threshold, the sounds of the officer's radios and the persistent chirping of crickets ceased as though the door had been closed behind me. I looked back to see Jim standing on the front porch just on the other side of the open door, trying and failing to mask his dread. I shot him a quick smile and motioned with my head for him to come in. After a moment and a deep breath, he joined me in the silence.

It was an oppressive quietness. My ears were popping and began to ring as I stepped further into the foyer. If I hadn't seen Jim step in behind me, I would not have known he was there. We stood still a moment while I listened intently for anything, but the only new sound I detected was the faint thumping of my heart and the unsettling whooshing sound of the blood it was pushing through my veins with progressive intensity.



"See what I mean?" came what seemed like a whisper from behind me.



Jim moved to my side as we looked around.



"Is this place sound proofed?" I asked, half startled by the relative volume of my own voice resonating in my skull.



"Not that I can tell. Even if it were, you'd think those broken windows would let somethin' in."



I moved my light towards the windows in the adjoined living room to see nearly all of them had been shattered at one point or another.



"This isn't even the half of it..." he said, pointing his light to the wooden staircase ahead.



Wondering what could possibly be stranger than the silence, I made my way to the staircase and began my absurdly quite ascent. The stairs were old but mostly intact. I could feel the old boards flexing under my weight but, now expectedly, there was no groaning of wood against wood. I stopped halfway up the stairs upon noticing the absence of something else.



"Didn't you say the body was in decomp?" I asked.



"What?" Jim responded in what seemed like a whisper.



I turned to face him "Decomp. Didn't you say the body was in decomp? I don't smell shit."



"Yeah, noticed that too."



Once we were at the second floor landing, I moved my light to the left down the hallway to see several doors in varying states of openness and a few small piles of refuse left by trespassers. Looking to the right, I saw it several feet from the top of the stairs -- leaning against the wall in a sitting position was the subject of my being in that strange home. The skin had began to turn a brownish black, the hair on its head had began to sluff off, and it wasn't as bloated as I thought it should be, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. Although its features were not very evident, I could tell by its lack of clothing that it was most definitely the body of a male. I set my flashlight on the banister ensuring the beam remained trained on the body, raised my camera, and snapped a photo of the gruesome scene.



I saw Jim's light coalesce with mine and I turned to ask a question.



"Fuck me..." he said, all of the color drained from his face.



I looked at the body then back to Jim.



"You told me on the phone that he was in a closet." I said in a near-scolding tome.



He stood silent, light and eyes trained on the rotting corpse.



"Jim, if you're about to tell me --"



"It was, Ted. It fucking was."



"Was? What do you mean it 'was'?"



"I mean it was in the closet two doors down on the left from the stairs when I last fuckin' saw it..." he said, panic now rising in his voice.



I shined my light to the left to see the closet door standing open. Scanning the dirty, wooden floor between it and the body, I saw a damp trail leading between the two. I drew my pistol.



"Jim, did you and your boys clear th --"



"Yes we cleared the fuckin' house, Teddy! No one's here and no one's came in."



"Unless one of you moved it, we have someone else in here!" I snapped, now scanning each doorway for movement.



"I'll hold here. You go get the others and clear the first floor. Meet me back here once you're done." I said without looking, Jim's light moving from the body being the only confirmation he had heard me.



"Get a few other units out here to set up a perimeter too!" I yelled, the internal volume hurting my ears. I wasn't sure he had heard me but I didn't want to turn and check.



I had been in hairy situations before but this was most definitely the strangest. I scanned left and right again, half expecting to see a head poking out from one of the rooms. Sensing that I needed to calm down, I took a few deep breaths and moved my light back to the corpse. I knew that I had a few minutes before the three patrolmen cleared the first floor and made it back to me, so I decided to use that time to try and deduce the location of our intruder. The Looking at the floor in front of each doorway I couldn't see any sign of recent disturbance save for the boot prints from the patrolmen's boots and damp drag marks consisting of a reddish-yellow fluid. Surprisingly, the second story windows were all mostly intact with a few sporting various cracks and chips from decades of neglect. All of them were closed, however, and appeared to have been so for some time given the cob webs and dust built up around the edges. Unless there was a way off of the second story from inside one of the rooms, someone had to be up there with me. I looked at the body, specifically the arms and legs. If someone had drug it from its previous location, the desiccated skin would be torn by the pressure but, from my position, I couldn't tell if that were the case. From what I could see, there wasn't a rug, blanket, or any other item that could have been used to pull it along the floor either. The cadaver was sitting on the floor with nothing underneath it, rotting flesh to hardwood.



Minutes passed as I stood at the top of the stairs. The relatively light weight of my pistol and light seemed to increase as my arms and shoulders began to tire. I couldn't hear where the patrolmen were in the house or if they were inside at all. Despite how scared he may have been, I knew Jim would be back inside as quick as he could. It was the younger men I feared may refuse to come back inside if they knew what had transpired. Another two minutes passed and I spared a look behind me. No sound as I expected, but no lights either. The thought crossed my mind that the sicko had made it down to the first floor at some point and Jim and his men were needing help.



Checking both ends of the hallway one last time, I backed down the stairs, keeping an eye on the landing. Still no noise. I took each step carefully as to not fall, keeping one foot planted firm on one step and sliding the other down to the next. I kept waiting to hear the sounds of a scuffle or gunshots, but heard nothing but my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I took a few more steps, feeling that I should be close to the bottom, and turned my head to look behind me. Jim and the other two officers stood at the bottom of the stairs, guns and lights in hand.



"Jesus!" I exclaimed, startled by their appearance behind me. "Where the fuck have you been?"



"We found some more rooms towards the back here that we hadn't checked yet. Took us a bit longer. Any signs up there?"



"Nah, no signs. It was just me and John fucking Doe up there catching up. Let's go clear the second floor." I said, more than a bit agitated.



The four of us made our way back up the stairs, myself at point. With backup behind me I felt a bit braver and took the steps much quicker than I had before. I had hoped that by my leaving and the absence of noise of our return, we would catch the bastard trying to move the body again. Approaching the final steps before coming back into view of the body, I slowed my pace, steadied my breath, and prepared for a fight. I felt a hand on my shoulder reassuring me I wouldn't be in it alone. As my head broke the threshold, I shined my light into the hallway.

The corpse was gone.

"Fuck!" I exclaimed, rushing onto the landing, looking to down both ends of the hallway.

All at once, sound returned like a tidal wave. Footsteps sounded like thunder and creaking of the floorboards sounded as though the house was about to give way. I looked around to see Jim and the other officers now on the landing and shining their lights wildly around the area.

Jim and I took the right side of the hallway and the other two took the left. We cleared each room and closet, nook and cranney. Nothing.

Additional officers arrived on scene and searched the house as thorough as possible. Aside from trash and debris, we found absolutely nothing.



There was a brief internal investigation on all of us who were at the scene that night. We had to go through interviews, polygraph examinations, and psychological evaluations before we were cleared to return to regular duties. It seemed ridiculous to me that they would even think that any of us would or could have hid or destroyed that body, but, in all fairness, what other explanation could there be? If it weren't for the picture I took of the body, they might have thought we were experiencing a mass delusion or under the affects of carbon monoxide poisoning. I wonder if there wasn't anything of the sort going on at that time. I mean, no sound? No smell? Someone or some*thing* moving the body and getting away?



One of the younger officers from that night decided to quit after the internal investigation concluded and, I don't really blame him. I, myself, stayed with it. I'm still working this case when I can and, I'm not exactly sure where to start.



If there's anything to tell in the future, I'll be sure and post it here.
