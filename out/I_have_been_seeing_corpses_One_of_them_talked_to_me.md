His legs had been swept from under him, mangled under tires until his guts almost looked like strawberry-jam, maggots infested the crevices of his body that had been ripped apart and mangled and decorated with deep-etched tracks by tires. I couldn't make out anything of him besides the maggots and the rot; that mind-numbingly disgusting rot. My dad was unphased, weirdly so, by the mangled corpse of a boy my age, plastered in the middle of the road and melting into concrete under the sun. I turned away from it and shut my eyes tightly, unable to look at it anymore.

My dad glanced over at me. He was wearing a jersey, for the 49ers, I know because he has owned that shirt since before I was born. It's old and red like the corpse in the road. "You alright?"

I was baffled, and nauseous. Very nauseous. I couldn't get it out of my head; those maggots crawling out of a deep tear in his skull, maggots wiggling throughout the ripped and rotted skin that made it's way down the middle of his face. Ripping his features right in half, and those maggots were dancing in it. In his rot.

Finally, I managed, "You don't," my stomach pulled itself in and I gagged into the palm of my hand, "you don't see that?"

The car slowed down.
".. see what?"

I forced myself up and I wrapped my arms over my stomach as I turned to look out the window.

It was gone. The body was gone. The smell was gone. The maggots were gone. The rot was gone. It was all just gone. All of it.

My lips parted and gaped. I probably looked really stupid; like a fish looking for water.

".. Nevermind." I breathed out, sinking down into the passenger's seat.

"What? What was it?" My dad sounded worried, almost.

".. It was nothing."

"Fiona."

"It was really just nothing, I thought I saw roadkill. Sorry."

When I was twelve, my mom killed herself.

It happened at 2:37 PM. I get out of school at 2:00, it's a fifteen minute drive home when my dad picks me up. He was at work that day, somebody took off and his manager asked him to come in. He was working at the deli at the tiny, local supermarket on second street at the time. Usually when this happens, I get on the city bus, because I hate the school bus. It was a five minute wait for the bus. I got picked up at about 2:06, because the bus had to stop and the old man that lives at the top of the street my school sits on and two other older kids from school got on before me. I remember sitting at the very back, my bruised, rosy knees were pushed together uncomfortably and I was anxiously rolling the strap on my backpack around my finger. The bus ride was thirty minutes, because the bus was extremely slow and had to stop at three different stops. The two older kids were sitting next to each other and talking to each other about something Jennifer B. said at lunch the whole time. I was left with the old man, who always kind of made me uncomfortable. I remember him looking back at me and flashing me a grin that I just found kind of gross. I was last off the bus.

It was 2:30 when I got off, it was a six minute walk home in the autumn breeze, with leaves falling around me and puddling into large mountains. A cheap, scratchy doormat with a vomit-green witch covered in warts on a broom was sitting in front of our door. I remember it had the words "Trick or Treat!" on it, and there was a speech bubble as if the witch was saying it. I pushed open my front door and pulled off my shoes and tossed my backpack near the door. Usually my mom was sitting on the couch or in my parents' room, sleeping. My entire life, she slept alot. She was never up in the morning to help me get ready for school, and she was always asleep before I could say goodnight to her. If I was lucky, she was awake for dinner, but would go to bed before neither me or my dad were finished. Almost every night, it was just me and my dad. She wasn't on the couch. I went upstairs and noticed that the bathroom door was cracked open. I'm still not sure why I looked. I slowly walked towards the door. I remember the air being really thick, weirdly thick. I kind of felt like it was hard to breathe. It was like how it feels on a really hot, muggy day. Like the day I saw that body in the road.

"Mom?" I muttered as I pushed open the door. My mom was staring into the mirror. There was a kitchen knife, a jaded-edge one with a scratched black handle, sitting on the sink. My mom pushed her dirty blonde hair off her shoulders, slowly pulling her fingers through it, before she reached down and grabbed the knife.

"Mom?" I repeated. It was almost like she didn't hear me, or she was ignoring me. She turned to me, tightly gripping the knife in her hand. Her grip was so tight I think her head was turning red from it. Her eyes were glossy and puffy with tears, and she was wearing the pajamas she went to bed with the night before, even though she usually would've changed by then.

"I'm so sorry, Fiona." And with that, she plunged the knife into her chest. Her mouth gaped and gasped and I will never forget the way her chest spasmed with each stab. I remember blood spurting from her chest, staining the knife, some of it sprinkling onto my shirt and arms. I didn't fully register what was going on at first, I guess. It was all happening so fast, like a snap. She stared at me with with those wide, bulging eyes the whole time. Until she slowly buckled to her knees and I finally found it in myself to run down the steps and, covered in my own mother's blood, I called 911.

I still remember almost every detail leading up to it and what happened after. An ambulance and police showed up in about fifteen minutes. My mom, who was barely breathing and was gasping for air, was carried out the house and put on a stretcher, pushed into an ambulance and taken away. Our house was illuminated with flashing navy and red lights, and I could hear the sirens from inside the house. They were like a baby wailing; over and over and over and over. They just kept going. Two officers, who I actually don't remember what they looked like; despite remembering almost everything else, walked inside and found me with my knees huddled up to my chest on the cold kitchen floor. I remember the smell of the house. It was nauseating, that metallic and pale smell. It almost seemed like it was apart of my imagination, like it wasn't there, but I could smell it. It was all over me. With blood still sprayed across my entire torso, the officers carried me outside and sat me onto the porch and threw a heavy, warm shock blanket over my shoulders. The blanket only really made the smell stronger because of how warm it was, so I remember just wrapping it over my legs.

My dad almost knocked our mailbox over with how quickly and roughly he pulled into the driveway. He jumped out the car and looked over at the pool of officers and police cars in the road, and then he looked over at me, with wide eyes, and he ran over to me and hugged me.

"Fiona, what happened?"

That was when I first cried.

My mom was pronounced dead due to suicide that same night. I remember watching her blood drip it's way down into the drains as I showered. I hated having to wash her off of me. My dad insisted on cleaning it first. That entire night, I could hear my dad's exasperated sobs as he wiped my mother's blood off the walls and the floors. I didn't sleep. The next morning, my dad dropped off my blood-soaked clothes and the knife at the police station as requested. I took a month off of school; within that month was the funeral.

My dad had to plan it by himself. My eulogy was written on a tiny, ripped piece of paper, in scribbled, dark pencil. I could only get about half of the first sentence in before the image popped in my mind; the knife plunging in her spasming chest over and over and over again. My dad had to read my eulogy for me, his voice wavering and thick as he read it.

My mom's body in that casket was more creepy than comforting. It was uncanny. I watched her die and now her lifeless eyes were staring up at me.

I wasn't told what made my mom kill herself. It was kind of like everyone treated me like the clueless child who should know nothing. One time, I caught my dad on, I guess, a good day, and he would tell me that my mom was always dealing with things that were happening in her mind. Things that were hard for everybody, including her, to understand, and she just cracked under that pressure. I think the idea of her having some type of mental illness is more comforting than there just not being a reason at all. My dad got fired from his job shortly after because he was always late, despite the efforts I made to wake him up and get him out of bed every morning. I almost failed the sixth grade. Which is kind of embarrassing to type out. If it hadn't been for my dead mom, I would have repeated, but they gave me a sympathy pass.

That dead body in the road was not the last I saw of it.

It tries to catch me off guard. I've gotten used to it enough that I don't freak out the way I used to. I understand that nobody else can see it, but it's still real. It's very real. No matter how.. insane, I guess, this sounds I promise you the bodies I see are as real as my mom's lifeless body in that casket.

It, I guess I'll call it, takes the form of dead bodies. The bodies of people I don't know. They haven't talked to me or anything else. They're just there. I realized very quickly that nobody else can see them, but they are real. I've never touched one, of course, because that's disgusting and the smell is so strong that I think I would actually puke if I touched one. They're real– not real enough to cause any physical disease– but real enough that it bothers me.

This morning, there was a woman. Long, dead strands of raven hair hung off her head and draped down her body. She was hanging from the branch of the tree sitting in front of my school, pale feet dangling just above the head of a senior girl, sitting next to a senior boy and sneaking a cigarette right in front of the school. I thought about how obvious and stupid that was. I thought about how unaware they were that a lynched woman was hanging right above them.

I try to ignore it. The only reason I'm writing this is because I want somebody to, I don't know, believe me. I haven't told anybody because I know they would never believe me. It sounds insane, I know. It sounds just so.. insane and not real and just totally fake and I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm apologizing, maybe because I know how insane I sound. "You're just grieving!" I feel like someone might say.

Thats the thing; it didn't start until this year.

If I am just grieving, and this is just some sort of grief-induced schizophrenia or something, wouldn't it have started after my mom died? It wouldn't have waited three years, right? Or is that just optimistic? Hallucinations aren't this real. They can't be.

I barely talk to my dad anymore, because I'm scared I'm going to let it slip one day and he's going to think I'm absolutely insane and, I don't know, throw me in a psych ward or something. He gets worried about me though, I can tell. He tries to somehow insert himself in my life more. He comes into my room to say goodnight to me some nights. One night I remember almost gagging as I heard the squish of his bare foot in the pile of mashed organs sitting on my bedroom floor, which I had to sleep in the same room as the entire night, until morning, when it was just gone.

Sometimes, I feel like the bodies can see me. Maybe not through their eyes, but somehow, they can see me. Watch me. That sounds insane. I know, but I know, deep down, that I am not lying. The truth is, I'm scared. I'm scared like crazy that this thing, whatever it is, that pretends to be dead people and watches me and stares at me, will one day stop the charade and will one day either say something or do something or hurt me or something. I think the scariest part is that I can't even begin to imagine what it's capable of, or why it's doing this to me, or what it even is.

I'm scared to tell anyone I know. So I tell you, abunch of strangers on the internet. The only thing I ask of you is to just believe me. Even if you doubt me a little.

...

The room smells like thick lavender air freshener and a faint smell a sweaty-kid filled classroom, it's a weird, kind of migraine-inducing combination. My fingertip is turning a dark pink from the backpack strap wrapped tightly around. I glance at the time. It's only 1:46.

I look up at my guidance counselor, and that weird, unwavering stare she gives me with her wide eyes over those tiny, little glasses. I'm starting to not like that faint buzz from the air conditioner.

".. Is everything alright?" Mrs. Carson asks, voice barely above a whisper. That 'gentle' tone she's trying isn't helping. I think I just want to go home. This is making me feel almost naked; pulled apart and presented for abunch of college med students to examine like I'm a picture in a textbook.

I inhale sharply before talking. "Yeah. Everything's fine." I answer, maybe too simply for her. Her nose scrunches slightly. She does that when she's trying to think deeper; put together some piece of the puzzle that maybe I haven't yet. Trust me, I've put my puzzle pieces every which way and they just don't go.

".. Are you sure?"

"I'm sure." I want to leave.

She shifts in her seat and glances down at her desk for a silent moment, accompanied only by the buzzing of that air conditioner that's beginning to nauseate me, before wheeling her chair back to the file cabinet tucked in the corner, behind a large potted plant, and pulling open the middle drawer. There's a laminated piece of paper with the word "freshman 2023" typed on it, in basic font. She thumbs through it, sticky noises protruding from the cabinet as files unstick and stick again, and I think it's making me nauseous.

Finally, she pulls one out. My name, "Fiona Halle", is written on it in sloppily written, beginning-to-smudge marker. It's packed with papers, unlike others that are basically empty. She sets it down. "Do you know what this is?" She asks, gentle voice more.. demanding? than before, and I think she might be trying the interrogation approach.

It doesn't work. Trust me.

".. My file."

"Yes. Very good. Your file, here, has your medical records from the school nurse and what your doctors and dentists will offer us and I put things in here, whenever I have a particularly interesting talk with you, and other psychiatrists and therapists have put things in here. We do this because we want to be able to.. help you. We want to be able to go back and reference something that will help us understand something more about you, put together a piece of the puzzle that maybe.."

I haven't yet. Like I've said, my puzzle just doesn't go. Its like one of those puzzles for toddlers, the one with the cube-shaped block and the star-shaped block and the whatever-shaped block, but the slots that have been given to me don't accommodate my pieces. My puzzle is genuinely unable to be put together. I've accepted it. As much as I can, anyway.

The monotone buzzing is growing louder as she waits for me to say something.

"Uhm.. okay. I get it."

"Good. Okay.. now, what I'm about to ask you is abit.. out of practice, but I think this might be good for you.. would you like to read it?"

No. "Okay."

She slides the folder over to me. It's a sticky manilla folder that smells like vanilla and rust. I page through, trying not to think about the way Mrs. Carson eyes me as if she's waiting for me to bite at something. Find something that will make all of this make sense. I stop at a dark pink page, which has my school picture, albeit grainy and in gross black and white, and a label for the child protective services at the top. Child services only came by my house once, after the funeral. The school got worried because a month long break and coming back looking awful is a sign that something might be wrong at home, I guess. They sent a short redhead who looked fresh out of college and untouched by whatever horrors she might be seeing at her job. She was nice enough, though her whole.. self just felt fake. That sounds weird, I guess, but I just mean that she didn't seem like she was being herself. She was putting on an act for her job. It was more unsettling than comforting.

She was really nice about everything though. My dad had to take me to this house that had only two cars parked outfront, and a sign for the child services on the door. A fifty-something woman with a pixie-cut, who smelled like stale cigarettes and cheap vanilla-bean lotion, basically interrogated me about my entire life. It was almost like she wanted me to have been abused– to know she was right all along. She was probably disappointed to learn that I have a fine life. Besides the dead bodies. I didn't mention that. I look back down at the paper and skim over it. It just states basic information, like my name and date of birth, and my dead mom. I meet Mrs. Carson's gaze.

".. Did you find anything?" She asks, but I can only focus on the child hanging off the curb. They're small, younger than me, elementary age, even. I can't tell whether it's a boy or girl. They're chest has been completely ripped open. Ribs dripping in fresh blood and flesh are exposed and rotting to under the sun, organs are messily thrown out every which way along they're chest. Their eyes are.. gone. The sockets are hollow and carved out, and among that pale, zombie-like face, two deep-carved, hollow holes sit like rooted spheres. Flies are dancing around the body like this is a banquet for them. I see a singular maggot wiggling around inside the open, ripped cavity of the chest. It smells like rot and just.. everything bad. Even from here. The lavender air freshener and freshly brewed black coffee isn't enough to mask the rot. I think that's what bothers me the most, that rot.

Mrs. Carson leans forward, almost blocking the view. I scoot over slightly. ".. Ms. Halle?"

".. I was just.." I trail off. The cold, numb lips of that corpse start moving. It gasps for air. Why is it trying to talk? It's never done this before, why now? What does it have to say. I get up and run over to the window, beginning to pry my fingers at it. Mrs. Carson quickly gets up, the table trembling slightly as she stands. I can hear her cup settling. It's loud. Much louder than it should be. The buzzing is practically screaming now as I finally force the window open and lean out. 

"Ms. Halle, what are you–"

It talks. "I'm getting restless, Fiona."

"What," I tremble. Tears are pooling at my eyes. "What are you?" I ask. It gives me no response. I'm getting frustrated. Why won't it talk to me now? I slam my hands against the window out of frustration. The slam sounds through the room. "What are you!?" I'm demanding through blotchy sobs now. I feel bad for Mrs. Carson. She is starting to panic. She runs to the phone and begins to dial someone. Her finger pressing against the keys is just so loud. Everything is just so loud and now I'm screaming at it , "What are you!? Talk to me, you asshole! What are you!?"

It laughs. Well, I think it tries to. It's scratchy and deep. Almost like a dog barking. The pried-open chest heaves with every phlegmy bark and cough. Slowly, more maggots crawl from the fleshy cavern. Too many. An impossible amount. I mean, maggots can't breed that fast, but they're seeping out of the chest by the thousands.

"Three more weeks, Fiona." It almost sings. I can't scream. I just shut my eyes and cry. I pray for it to go away. ".. What are you?" I ask, voice more weak than before. The door is quickly pushed open and people come running in. I can't see them, not until one of them grabs my arm. "Fiona? Ms. Halle? Can you hear me?" My principal is barking in my right ear, accompanying the corpse's god-awful attempt at laughing at me, mocking me, in my left ear. I finally pull my eyes open, only to find that it's gone. I gasp out. Where is it? It was right there. Right there. Why is it gone? Why did it even talk to me in the first place? What did it mean, by you only have three weeks left? The security guard runs over and grabs at my arm, deep and rough enough I'm sure it'll bruise. I gasp out in pain and I can't do anything but yell. Clutch my hands in fists and yell.

I'm typing this in the waiting room for the child services office. I'm so scared. I know, i know how insane it sounds but please believe me. It talked to me. It actually talked.

I'm not sure if I'm going to survive the next three weeks, and I'm so scared.
