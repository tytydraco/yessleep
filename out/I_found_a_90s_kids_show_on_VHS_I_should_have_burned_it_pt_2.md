I walked into my bedroom to see my VCR was turned on. That fucking thing.... Sunny was on my television, staring back at me.  Wide eyed, he stared back at me with a wide grin. The whole background behind him was static. Enough was enough, I grabbed my VCR and chucked it across the room. That.... was a mistake. I'm sorry Danny.

I don't know how, but that bastard escaped into our reality. At first it started with the shadows, It would appear in the corners of the apartment. I just thought it was my imagination, I haven't been getting good sleep lately so I attributed it to that. I keep on feeling I am being watched, almost like how a wild animal would stare at you. 

My dreams got weird, I would always be in a graveyard. Then, I would see Sunny happy as ever. Standing next to my grave, the next thing you know, im in a coffin, lowering down. Sunny would be staring at me that whole damn time, waving. I would always wake up after that. Sometimes, I would hear whispering, and other times, I would hear a TV show like it was playing in my head. My sleep got worse after that started, I practically lived on 5 hour energy. 

I started researching online about Sunnys Neighborhood. I couldn't find anything, and I gave up. It was almost like it never existed in the first place. I was beyond frusterated.

I went to a psychiatrist. It just got too much to deal with. After a few weeks of talking, I was told I was just stressed out. How I needed to relax, and then the dreams would magically disappear. They did not. They only amplified. Now, it got to a point where I couldn't see a cartoon without seeing Sunny in the background. I was fucking terrified. I was going insane, I should have said no to babysitting.

I was babysitting my nephew Danny today. After a few hours of video games and Nerf fights, he wanted to watch television. I turned on nicktoons and went to go do some work. After 20 minutes, I heard Danny talking to someone. I walked into the room, and he was staring at me, like I was intruding on a conversation.

>Me: "Hey, who were you talking to?"

>Danny: "My new friend"

Danny was almost 6, so I just assumed he had an imaginary friend.

>Me: "Ah, can I meet your friend? What's his name?"

>Danny: ""His name is Sunny, he said he doesn't like you very much."

My blood ran cold. How could Danny know about that thing? This had to be a coincidence. Then it happened, and Danny was gone. Laughter filled the apartment. It was deafening. I couldn't breathe. I was frozen... and then it all went black.

It's been 2 weeks, and they still haven't found my nephew. I know that bastard took him, I don't know how or where. I see his smile in my sleep, I would give anything to not see that smile again, but I have to find my nephew. 

If you're reading this, and you found a copy of Sunnys Neighborhood, burn it.... burn it to fucking ash. Don't let what happened to me happen to you.
