This all started in September when the Milton family moved in next door.

  


I'll keep the details short, as I don’t want to drag anyone into public drama, so “Milton” isn’t their real surname.

  


Anyway…

  


My life was, for the most part, normal. I went to school, came home, and spent time with my friends. The usual stuff any teenager does, I suppose.

  


Things… started to go wrong once they bought the house next door after my previous neighbor passed away.

  


The Milton family has three members: Claire, the wife; Jacob, the husband; and a 3-month-old baby named Samuel.

  


Everyone liked them the moment they met. It doesn’t hurt that the family is apparently extremely wealthy, though I can’t get into the details of what they do for a living.

  


My parents became good friends with the Milton’s.

  


Yet, every time they came over to our house, I started feeling… something. They acted normal when my parents were around, but when I was alone with them, they stared at me.

  


At first, I thought maybe I was being impolite or too quiet, or maybe I gave them the impression that I disliked them, which, to be honest, I did.

  


Jacob and Claire had this… unnatural behavior around me. I swear, they looked at me like wild animals, much like a dog would freeze when it sees something at night.

  


The oddest thing, though, was the baby.

  


For the life of me, I can’t understand how they managed to spend three hours at our house and never took the baby with them.

  


Whenever I asked where Samuel was, they would get defensive and say they could hear him over the monitor and that he was asleep.

  


No one in their right mind would leave such a small baby alone.

  


Yet, everyone in the neighborhood adored these people, except for me and… my dog, Milo.

  


Milo is a golden retriever, the kindest breed of dog, and an absolute angel among his kind.

  


Milo would NEVER go near these people, and since they moved in, he hardly left his doghouse or my bedroom. He was always on edge.

  


Once, Claire and Jacob passed by him, and Milo shivered in fear. I swear the dog could sense that something wasn’t right with them.

  


I could tolerate them visiting our house occasionally, but this weekend changed everything.

  


For some reason, they invited my family on a weekend trip and asked me to babysit their literal baby.

  


Who in their right mind would leave a three-month-old with a teenager who’d never even held a baby?!

  


I outright refused, but my parents went berserk when I tried to say no.

  


So, I was forced to spend the weekend at their house.

  


I know how unbelievable this sounds, but I’m not exaggerating a single detail.

  


Once the four of them left and handed me the keys, I decided to take Milo with me.

  


The dog would not approach their damn house.

  


Stubborn, I pulled him by the collar and started dragging him toward the house.

  


Milo actually bit me to get away! Thankfully, it wasn’t a real bite… but still.

  


I entered the house, and the first thing I noticed was that the air was stale, as if it hadn’t been aired out since the previous owner died in it.

  


A strong smell of burnt herbs was also present.

  


And it was cold—so cold that you actually had to go outside to warm up.

  


I thought someone left the AC on by accident, but no, it was off.

  


So how did it get this cold?

  


And it wasn’t just chilly; my breath was freezing!

  


I turned the heat on, and imagining I was being chased by some demonic entity, I turned on every single light in the house.

  


Not my electricity bill, I suppose.

  


I saw the basement door and, for whatever reason, decided to put a chair under the knob, just in case.

  


I slowly went upstairs and entered the nursery.

  


Now, you’d think someone would get a normal crib.

  


But no, this crib looked straight out of the 1940s.

  


I looked at Samuel. He was a normal baby boy.

  


What immediately struck me as odd was that he NEVER cried. In fact, he showed no specific response when I picked him up or carried him. He didn’t care that it was freezing cold.

  


He behaved more like a grown man than a baby.

  


I made him some formula, fed him according to the instructions, and changed his diaper.

  


When I turned around to pick something up and then turned back, he had rolled onto his belly.

  


I said, “You can do that? Already?”

  


I picked him up, and he fell asleep, so I put him back in his crib and reached for the door.

  


I swear I heard him say, “I can do much more.” At which point, I jumped back, only to see him still sleeping.

  


Deciding to stay awake as long as possible, I went downstairs and turned on the TV.

  


After watching a few episodes of my series, I grabbed some food from the fridge and started eating.

  


Maybe it was just paranoia, but I think I heard someone turning the knob on the basement door.

  


At that point, I just wanted to leave and go home, but I couldn’t leave the baby alone.

  


Although I sure as hell didn’t want to take him back to my place.

  


So, after a while, I dozed off on the couch.

  


Now, something explainable happened, but it still disturbed me.

  


Supposedly, I had an “hypnagogic hallucination,” as I was later told. But what I heard was “Samuel is a gross misspelling of my name,” followed by an ear-piercing scream in my ear.

  


I couldn’t sleep at all. In fact, I was so scared, I couldn’t even move away from the couch.

  


I started feeling like someone was watching me the whole time.

  


After a while, I heard the baby upstairs.

  


He wasn’t crying. It sounded like someone was trying to cry based on a Wikipedia description of crying.

  


I went upstairs and fed him another bottle of formula.

  


When I turned on the lights, I swear his pupils were dilated—not unnaturally, but still, not nearly as much as they should’ve been.

  


I put him back to sleep and closed the door.

  


Somehow, again, I could hear someone whispering, “Vanessa.”

  


Panicking and not knowing what to do, I made the dumb decision to search the parents’ room.

  


I opened the door and was hit with a foul, moldy stench.

  


The bedroom was full of weird books, most of them in Arabic or Turkish and some in languages I couldn’t even remotely recognize.

  


I didn’t bother taking pictures or reading them as I was already creeped out.

  


Stupidly enough, I opened their medicine cabinet, took a random sleeping pill, and ran back downstairs.

  


Fear and panic make a person make…stupid decisions.

  


I felt drowsy and, quite frankly, drugged as I sat on the couch.

  


And I fell asleep.

  


Now, this is the strangest part.

  


I had the worst nightmare of my life. My dream started as I descended the stairs into the basement. Inside, I saw occult symbols, and Samuel was playing in the middle.

  


I reached to pick him up, and he called out my name.

  


I could almost feel hands touching my face.

  


I looked around and saw dozens of draped-over bodies reaching their hands toward me.

  


I woke up screaming, yet I was still drowsy.

  


By some miracle, my parents had an argument with the Milton’s and made an early return.

  


Mom noticed I was… acting odd, but she made an effort not to give me away.





“Come on, Vanessa,” she pulled me by the hand and walked me back home.

  


Milton and my father exchanged a look and left without a goodbye.

  


As I left, I heard Samuel crying in the nursery. God, how long had he been hungry?

  


We got home, and my parents apologized for putting me in that situation.

  


They looked… disturbed by something, but refused to tell me no matter how much I pressed them.

  


The worst part is that I can’t, for the life of me, remember if the basement door was open or closed when I left.

  


Also, I could swear my mother calling the baby Samael by accident.
