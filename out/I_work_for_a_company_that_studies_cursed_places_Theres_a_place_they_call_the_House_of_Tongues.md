So it all started with a box of bees. It was deep within the stores of the Company, in the depths where only the bravest dare enter. Well, that, and literally about everyone with a basic Level One access code.

And in the depths one could find a box of bees, all dead and devoid of any color. Bees that had once nested in the suburbs of North Carolina, in an odd house that had always stood there.

They called it the House of Tongues.

My name is Canopy Hydrangea. I recover cursed artifacts, explore haunted places, and report back the information needed to the people I work for. The Company then arranged what has to be done to remove these blemishes from the world.

If it isn’t possible, we make sure the evil of cursed artifacts and bizarre places doesn’t make its way to the general public. 

But sometimes, it’s important to leak a report or two to the unsuspecting public. Makes for a good warning- and this particular file is one of many that must be known.

“So, team,” I began, as we sat around an old fireplace, in the bakery-turned cover for our base of operations, “what has the Company found us today?”

Rainie, my key assistant, tuned up the old projector and pressed a few buttons. Kyran faked a yawn, and my scrollkeeper, Cypress, laughed.

We all stopped laughing when the image of a dead dog, bloodied and covered in long, piercing slashes emerged. “So let’s talk about the House of Tongues,” Rainie began, changing the slide to an image of a remodeled, but still old looking house. “This house was built back in the 1620s, and…”

I’ll cut Rainie’s exposition by a lot here. Many unnecessary details, but details that kept us intrigued and interested.

The house, built in 1627, was built by a migrating priest and his family. Initially, it was supposed to be a small cabin, a little summer place for rest and meditation. This all changed when, according to local mythology, the priest was offered a deal by an odd man in white and black.

He called himself the Night Merchant, and the priest gave up his cabin, and within seven days and seven nights a grand, expansive house replaced it.

The licking began to take place nearly a year after that. Not much is known from the priest’s records- as Rainie tells it, “his words were deemed heresy and burned.”

But we do know that the house, named Attager Place changed hands over the centuries, though most records were lost to time. The more important records come after the end of the Great War.

1927. A family, the Bakers, moves into Attager Place, now remodeled to fit it with a little town that popped up from the economic boom.

1928. William Baker’s ‘youngest’ daughter reports a sensation at night, a strange rough feeling, as if she were being ‘licked by a cat’. Cats do not approach Attager Place- in fact, the house does not seem to welcome all but human life.

Cats who approach it go mad and disappear. The family dog Baker brings along is found on the street, eviscerated by long, piercing slashings the police could never explain.

Three months later the sightings begin.

William Baker goes out one day to investigate mewling noises behind the house. The entire backyard is trashed: pots have gone flying, dirt has been dug- the entire garden has been uprooted.

Darting around the corner are monsters. Small, slender things, an ashen white with bodies as thin as sticks; their bones show, the muscles pulse.

But strangest of all are their heads, large and muscular, adorned with small horns that dot it, and two eyes he states as ‘deep blue like the sea’. Terrified and confused, William goes back to the house to fetch a rifle.

When he goes back, though, they’ve vanished.

The noises continue for the rest of the year- but always gone before he can take a good, clear look. But something else, far more chilling and incredible has appeared- one of his two daughters have vanished.

Both Company and government records show that the Bakers only had one daughter. And yet, in the cold winter of 1928 William Baker finds himself mad, shocked as he begins to remember a daughter that never existed.

An older daughter, he remembers. But try as he might, he can’t picture her face- nor find any certificates, legal evidence she had existed.

But in the halls of the house she does. There’s a bedroom with things that aren’t supposed to be there. A bed, posters, and books- all evidence a teenage girl had once lived there.

But on paper, she does not exist. And neither does she exist in the minds of anyone else. His wife and ‘only’ daughter do not acknowledge the extra room. His neighbors seem to avoid him.

1929. At night, they come. They appear as shadows in the windows, peering in with small hands, large, blue eyes. And then they open a circular, razorlike mouth and a long tongue with teeth emerges, licking the window and gently cracking it.

William takes his rifle and journeys outside.

The creatures seem to taunt him, gracefully avoiding his gunshots, leading him deeper and deeper into the woods that were not there when he bought the place. When he realizes, all too late, that his fences have ceased to exist- it’s too late.

The creatures are gone. And behind him, in the large house called Attager Place, there are screams.

When William Baker finally finds the house again, everything is silent. His wife and child are gone. The creatures sit cross legged and wait, tongues eerily lolling out. He shoots them but the bullets always seem to miss.

By dusk, they are gone.

Legally, William Baker's wife and two kids do not exist. He spent the rest of his life telling the same tale in a mental asylum. He also claimed the creatures followed him there, always peeking in through the bars and windows.

He is found near death one day, bizarre lacerations and slashings. A man comes by, wrapped in shadow and gives him a buzzing box.

Bees. And the creatures never appeared-

“Wait,” Kyran cut in, “you’re saying that bees, of all things stopped these… tongue aliens?”

Rainie nodded, almost in disbelief of the story herself. “Whoever gave him those bees knew how to deal with them,” she continued. “However it works- it worked. William got out the asylum and lived the rest of his life as a-”

“A beekeeper!” Cypress guess. Rainie nodded. “So if this case is closed, why has the Company handed it over to us?”

Rainie sighed in disappointment. “As I was saying,” she remarked, teeth clenched, “the bees have failed.” A slide displayed thousands of dead bees, around the house. “In 1937 two Company Agents bought the house and bombarded the place with beehives. Beehives that have remained ever since, cared for by a gardener.” She paused and switched it over to another angle. “Last week, the gardener vanished, only remembered by a single surviving Company agent. Any guesses as to what they want us to do?”

I nodded and gleefully raised my hand. “They want us to clean it up. The bees, and the uh,” I tried to think of the name, “Tongue Aliens. Tonliens, if you will.” That generated some laughter. “Cypress, Kyran, you two are my containment experts-”

Cypress revealed a drawing on an iPad- “Already working on a spell.”

Kyran shrugged. “The new Ironsalt Guns are ready.”

I looked at Rainie in anticipation, wondering if there was more. “That’s about it- there’s a similar story that happened in 1932, but same old, same old.” She paused, thinking. “We should also watch for artifact hunters- sources suggest Lorreno’s crew may be looking to seize one of the uh, aliens for themselves.”

I practically growled- Lorreno and his crew were a gang of villains that dabbled in selling cursed artifacts and cryptids to shady dealers. “Cryptid smuggling?”

Rainie nodded. Cypress noted this as well. “If they show, boss, we’ll take them out this time.”

By the next hour we’d prepared all we’d needed. We stood by a large, symbol adorned mirror and waited. Cypress chanted some ancient, long forgotten poetry, and the mirror changed to a quiet street.

Rainie stepped through, then Cypress, Kyran, and me, and then we were face to face with Attager Place.

I felt a sense of great discomfort. “Do you-” I muffled my ears, suddenly starting to hurt, “head that?!”

It was the sound of bees, buzzing all at once in a cursed, malevolent death knell. I screamed in pain and fell to the floor. Cypress caught me as I fell and read off of their phone. “Infected beast of… unholy…” I drifted in and out as the ghost swarm dazed me, “begone!”

And it was over, and my vision cleared. “The house is… powerful,” I murmured. “I don’t think we’re just dealing with the tongue things,” I stammered, still dizzy. “There’s,” I reached into the ether, “more than one entity.”

Kyran looked a bit worried. “Should we call for backup?”

“Nah,” I replied. “We can take it.”

We entered the house, the buzzing still in the back of my mind. As told, a swarm of bees lay dead around the place, and with every step we took we a loud crunch emanated, echoing around the house.

Besides that, and the deep fear we were all beginning to feel, there was nothing. “All the events happened at night,” Rainie reminded. “And it is-”

drip-drop

Something red and thick fell onto my hand. It was blood. drip-drop. More began to fall from the ceiling, a river of blood pouring from cracks. It was cold and seemed to pulse in time, as if- alive.

Rainie wrote into a journal, then collected a sample. “Weird. It’s not a threat.”

Kyran nervously pointed his weapon around. “Well I don’t like it.”

“Well go on and Ironsalt it,” I told. “I don’t like it either.”

Kyran nodded, reached into his bag and found a sphere of white. We averted our eyes as he lit the fuse, tossing it up into the air and exploding in light, spraying us with salt and fine iron- enchanted so that it would not hurt us.

The ghost-blood stopped and fell to the ground, evaporating into ash. “One phenomena neutralized,” Rainie noted.

We continued onwards, until the house decided to shift itself, creaking, trying to spin its halls so that we would emerge back where we came from. We were at the kitchen- then it would creak, and the door we opened-

“Back up front,” I murmured.

“I’ll handle it,” Cypress offered, already beginning to chant. The place let out a sigh, and things were restored. “It won’t hold, though.”

And then they finally appeared. Little deformed things.

Pale bodies, large heads, large, bulbous eyes. They appeared in the corner of my eye at first, though as we ventured deeper into the house they seemed to dart here and there.

Kyran attempted to shoot them, but they seemed ever-evading, always just out of reach. Rainie noted them and sketched the beings. And as we got deeper the sound of the dead bees began to crescendo.

And other noises. The sound of screams, of pleas for help. The house seemed to go on forever, unfolding, each layer of the house seemingly older and more arcane from the last.

In front, it had seemed like a remodeled house. Inside, it was at least thirty years old, and in each subsequent hall, room it got older and older. In the distance we saw something dark and rocky.

“That’s a cave, isn’t it?” I asked.

Cypress’ magic was of no use either. “Wait,” they paused, as we reached the cave. The shadows flickered within, and the creatures seemed to whisper in the darkness. He spun around and gasped. “I think we’ve been tricked.”

I turned to see- a wall. A solid wall of paint and brick. “That wasn’t there the last time I-” I screamed as something lashed out, cutting me. “Agh!” A tongue drew into the darkness, sharp.

“Lights!” Rainie shouted, flicking on a lantern. The electric device sputtered, and failed- illuminating about a dozen tongue-things in the darkness, leaping out into shadow. “Damn it!”

Kyran began to fire aimlessly as more and more tongues darted in and out, slashing us. “Cypress, boss, solution?”

Cypress read off their phone, and a ball of light emerged in front of us, yet the darkness still remained. The wall behind us began to move, pushing us forward.

The magician yelped and tendrils of paint burst from the wall ensnaring him. “Help me!” I flicked a knife open and him loose.

We were being forced forwards. The wall behind us seemed ever fleshy now, tendrils of red dripping limbs reaching out at us. In front, tongues lashed out, cutting us up, one by one.

But we continued to push, running forwards and firing as the wall of flesh behind us forced us into the darkness.

“Look!” I shouted. “A building!”

There was something there. Ancient, and carved from stone. The ruins of an ancient temple that seemed just like the house. Statues of the tongue things lay in wait, eerily inviting us in.

The wall picked up speed, and we ran into the ruin, just as the wall crashed into it’s entrance, locking us within.

A flash- then black goo. “I got one!” Kyran cheered, stepping over and picking it up. It whined, still alive, and a tongue lashed out- only for Kyran to sever it. “They can be killed.”

Rainie was studying the walls of the temple- the death of the creature had scared them off- for now, at least. “This place is old. Like, really old- I’ve never seen this,” she gestured to the arcane symbols on the walls, “language before.”

Cypress knelt down next to two skeletons, little marks of teeth all over. “Must be the Bakers.”

Around us were more skeletons, all marked by small incisions. Most were ancient but some were all too new. A fresh corpse even lay in a corner, just a few days old.

I looked at it. I recognized the corpse as a black market artifact dealer. “Serves you right.”

“Company Agents-” Rainie gasped. A team, just like us lay dead on the floor, recently deceased. “I thought we were the first to come here in a long time?”

“This place,” I remembered, “eats people. Memories. HQ probably sent them and forgot they existed.”

A scuttling came from deeper within, and the sound of bees suddenly stopped. An unceasing quiet came next, and suddenly I preferred the bees to the quiet.

“I think,” Cypress announced, “I can get us out of here.” And then they reached into their backpack and brought out, of all things-

“Is that a cat?!” Rainie puzzled. “Did you actually-”

“I supposed it would come in handy,” Cypress confessed. “Plus, it isn’t mine, and I’ve got to return it.”

“Enough, guys,” I ordered. “Cypress, how does this work?”

A glint in their eye came now. “Well,” they began, “we know that the house hates animals, right?” we nodded. “Let’s see why.”

And with that, Cypress released the cat, and it trotted softly down a hall, deep into the temple. We followed, up until the cat stopped before a chamber, stone gates warding us off. 

I opened the gates- and then we saw it. 

This was some sort of congregation room, a grand hall filled with stone benches, ancient symbols of old religion, and- thousands of the creatures, all sleeping, save for a dozen or so chattering and climbing the walls. 

“Look- there,” Cypress pointed to light in the corner of the hall, where creatures popped in and out. “Daylight.”

“A way out,” I murmured.

“Just have to get through all of this first,” Kryan pointed out.

“Not necessarily,” Cypress started, “I’ll be right back.”

Cypress returned a moment later with the corpse of the tongue-creature, then inscribed several symbols into it with a knife. They lit up, and we walked into the haldl, Cypress leading us forwards. 

The creatures began to wake, jumping beside us and sniffing the air. “I’ve disguised us as a mass of them,” Cypress explained. “Let’s see how long this holds.”

The creatures ignored us, returning to hibernation. I observed the hall as we journeyed closer and closer to daylight. Statues of goat-like things watched us, tall and ancient, yet oddly familiar.

The creatures tended to the place, lighting candles and even managing a small garden towards the back. They did not construct the place- but whoever did left them to tend for it, to keep it sacred, safe.

“Oh no,” Cypress murmured. “The spell’s worn off.” That’s when the creatures began to shift, paying attention to us once again. Cypress gulped, found the cat and threw it. “Run!”

And so we did, towards daylight. The creatures lashed out at us, the cat seemed to distract them, pawing its way through the little beasts. “I need rope,” Cypress commanded, just as the light shone above us. 

An opening seemed so far away. “Here!” I tossed it, and Cypress reached out and, with ancient art, floated it up. 

“Climb!” I shouted, already beginning to do so. “Go!”

And as we climbed the creatures did so too, leaping from the walls to seize us. Kyran fired and Cypress did strange art. I slashed them away, and they fell to an ever growing pile below us.

Three were on the rope below us. “Take this!” Kyran slashed the rope, cutting them loose.

I rose into the light first, pressing open a grate and helping Cypress up. Rainie came next, then Kyran. I threw the rope over, and shut the grate back down. Still, they stuck to the walls, still chasing us.

I found an explosive, strapped it to the grate and ran. A boom came behind us, and no opening remained.

We were in the backyard. “I think,” I murmured, “I’m going to submit this place for immediate destruction.”

And that was that. The place had been surveyed, our job was done. We’d done all we could and found what we needed. We couldn’t stop them on our own. A request was made, and the last time I heard of the place, it had both been burned, collapsed, and creatures seized for further study.

Another day was done. Another bizarre placed kept under control. If you know a place marked by evil- let us handle it.
