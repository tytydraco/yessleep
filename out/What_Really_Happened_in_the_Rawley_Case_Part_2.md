Hello everyone, Part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mcbvsa/what_really_happened_in_the_rawley_case/)

Before I continue, I wanted to thank you for the messages that came into my DMs. Some were supportive, others... not so much. One person (with a newly created account and zero followers) sent me four messages in less than two minutes. The last one said:

*"Delete the post before someone else gets hurt."*

To be honest, I was already expecting that, and I have to say you're too late. I'm not doing this to gain any kind of recognition or fame. It's because this story exists independent of me, and it will keep existing after I'm gone. So, if it's going to be told, let it be by someone who was actually there.

By the way, a lot of people commented on something that made me think.

*"Does that mean you were the only one who escaped? The only one who walked and made it back?*"

You’re assuming I was the only one who came back. And that’s not true.

In fact, I didn’t write this part alone. Part of it is what I remember. Part was told by Wes, as you'll see later on in his conversation with Amy. It was that week when everything started to spiral out of control. In the first part I talked about the sound of the train, the mark on the chapel door, and of course, the child. Now, I'm going to tell you how we reacted to all of it, and I’d say this is where things really start to get strange. If a train that appears out of nowhere and ghost children surprised you, well, just wait until the end of this account.

The week after the train incident, Jake was driving like he was late for an appointment that didn’t exist. The city passed by as a blur through the windows, dirty storefronts, badly patched streets, crooked poles with wires stretched like dead veins, and I, in the passenger seat, tried to stay focused, but my mind kept drifting back to the mark on the chapel door and that sulfur smell that hadn’t gone away, even after days.

*— Are you sure we’re going to find anything there? —* he asked without taking his eyes off the road.

I didn’t answer right away. Part of me was still asking the same thing, but it was too late to pretend none of it was pulling me in like some old, inevitable magnet.

*— Ben found something, right? —* I murmured. — *Someone has to pick up where he left off.*

The public records building looked exactly like I remembered: a sickly rectangle of badly painted concrete, with windows so dark they looked covered from the inside. The sign above the door was faded, and someone had scratched out the word “Historical” in red paint, replacing it with “Hysterical”, a bit of vandalism that felt more like cautious irony than an attack on public property.

The first thing that hit me was the smell.

Old dust, with that faint trace of burnt oil and moldy paper, the kind of smell that only exists in poorly ventilated government buildings with metal filing cabinets from the last century. Jake bent down to pick up one of the bound catalogs, mumbling something about how city hall should digitize the archives.

I didn’t answer. My head was still stuck on that one sheet. A single word written at the top in red pen: "Pairs?"

Ever since I saw that, something inside me didn’t quite sit right. Like a piece of the world had been shifted half a centimeter off-axis. And now, here we were, neck-deep in the records room of Rawley’s Administrative Station, trying to figure out why the hell Ben would have left that word behind.

Wes didn’t come with us. He left early, saying he had to talk to Amy. According to him, "this can’t be done alone." And it wasn’t a metaphor. Apparently, the ritual, if we can call it that, doesn’t work with odd numbers. Always in pairs. Always two by two. No exceptions. At least that was his guess about Ben’s note, and I didn’t have a better one to argue.

At the time I thought it was an overreaction. Just another one of those rules made up by fear itself.  
But now, with the damp weight of the air and the silence on the ground floor, I wasn’t so sure.

— *Do you see this?* — said Jake, calling me over to a laminated newspaper clipping.

The headline hit me like a right hook:

**“Train 117: Crash kills two children at the south crossing. Engineer survives.”**

Two.

— *The children...* — I began.

*— Were sitting together,* — Jake finished. — *At the back of the carriage, side by side.*

He pointed to the blurry photo in the article. It was hard to see, but there were two tiny silhouettes under a white sheet. Next to them, a man in a railway cap, his face hidden by the warehouse shadow.

*— The engineer?*

*— It doesn’t say his name. Just that he was released from the hospital and moved away months later.*

There was more. Small side articles, accounts from locals who claimed they could still hear the train "at night", even years after the line had been shut down. An old man who swore he saw two children in uniform waving at the corner of the old platform. A teacher who said her students had started "playing odds and evens like crazy", even though no one had taught it to them.

A forgotten local superstition, maybe. A rumor powered by a steam engine, a collective delusion?

For Ben, it was everything.

Jake was reading a handwritten letter attached to the folder Amy gave us. Fast words, illegible in some places. But I managed to catch a part of it:

*— If I can reach them, I can ask. Not for me. But for her.*

*— Her? —* I murmured.

Jake looked at me.

— *Amy?*

I shrugged and didn’t answer. Because, at that moment, the room’s radio hissed. Neither of us had touched it.

There was no music, no voice. Just that harsh, deep static, like a TV after the broadcast ends. I jumped back immediately, startled.

*— Was that on?* — I asked.

Jake shook his head.

The sound stopped suddenly. Like it had been turned off the exact second we started staring. We kept looking at each other, and I knew he was just as scared as I was. Only the ticking of the clock made any kind of background noise. I could feel my leg trembling, anxious. Outside, the sky was already getting dark when we decided to leave.

We met up with Wes in the parking lot. Amy was with him. She looked hesitant, arms crossed and an expression that shifted between anger and exhaustion. But she was there.

While Jake and Amy argued about where to park the car closer to the station’s side entrance, I pulled Wes aside a bit. There was something I needed to know, even if part of me already guessed the answer.

— How did you convince her to come?

Wes hesitated. He has this way of always seeming on the edge between certainty and collapse. But this time, he slowly nodded and muttered, "Forget it."

I reached out to him after posting the first part. Apparently, he also saw the kind of “information” that’s been circulating about the case and wants to set the record straight too. He sent me an audio recording of a part of the conversation, captured on his old phone that night. I asked for permission to transcribe it here. Amy’s voice sounds weaker than I remembered. His… almost too calm.

*Partial transcript – Recording by Wes P.*

**Wes**: I know you don’t want to go back there. I don’t either, to be honest.  
**Amy**: Then why are you asking me this?  
**Wes**: Because you know he was looking for something.  
**Amy**: He wanted answers. But answers don’t bring anyone back.  
**Wes**: No. But maybe… maybe they explain why he never came back.  
*(short pause)*  
**Amy**: I don’t want to get on that train.  
**Wes**: Then don’t. Stay on the platform. Just go as far as you can. But if there’s any chance… to understand why he chose to go…  
**Amy**: You think he wanted to die?  
**Wes**: No.  
*(long silence)*  
**Amy**: I think he wanted to ask.  
**Wes**: Ask what?  
**Amy**: What happened to them.  
(another pause)  
**Wes**: To who?  
**Amy**: ok, I’ll go with you  
*(deep breath in the background, like a frustrated sigh)*

*(end of recording)*

After that, no one said anything else about what they expected to find that night. Maybe because, deep down, everyone already knew. Or maybe because, once you’ve decided to enter a place people don’t return from, silence starts to feel more comfortable than any plan.

We went in Jake’s car. I sat up front with him; Wes and Amy were in the back. The radio was off. The only sound was the engine, steady and constant, like a clock ticking straight toward the unknown. The sky was clear. The moon, full. The road to the station crossed a stretch where the tracks still ran across the asphalt, covered in weeds and dry sand. No one said anything when we passed over them. It felt like crossing an invisible border, crossing the Rubicon.

The station was as empty as ever, but the emptiness felt… dense. Like the place had prepared itself to receive us. Like that space knew. There was something suspended in the air. Not fear exactly, but an anxiety of ancient nature, almost tectonic, like the sense that something beneath our feet was about to shift.

We got out in silence. Each one holding something: Wes with his recorder, Jake with a flashlight, Amy with the folded envelope tucked inside her jacket, me with an old sketchbook I used to take notes. The platform was cold and damp. The concrete, cracked with wide veins, trembled slightly under our steps. Or maybe it was just my perception (lately I’d been doubting my own senses).

We waited there, still, for a time that felt longer than it really was. The train only appeared after midnight, but the final minutes of the day dragged on like a heavy anchor.

Then, it arrived. A high whistle sounded with a vibration on the tracks. One second we were alone, and the next, the train was there, as if it had been spat out from some fold in the air. Long, metallic, stained by time, with windows too opaque to see through.

The doors opened with a muffled noise. No passengers got off.

Wes was the first to move. He climbed one step, then another, stopping at the entrance. He looked inside and turned back to us with a pale but determined face. Jake followed, then Amy. I was the last.

The cabin door creaked as if it had been opened for the first time in decades, though the car’s structure looked intact, almost clean. The interior had that kind of yellowish light that doesn’t come from any identifiable lamp, like the entire car was giving off a dim glow on its own. No sound, except for our breathing. No engine vibrations. No conductor.

We sat two by two, just like we had agreed. Jake and Wes on one side, Amy and I on the other. The coarse fabric seat creaked under her weight, and when I sat beside her, I realized I couldn’t lean back comfortably, as if the curve of the backrest had been made for a different anatomy, slightly off from human. Amy didn’t say anything. Neither did I. But our hands were very close on the center divider, and at some point, our fingers touched. She didn’t pull away. Neither did I.

The train car remained still, as if waiting for something. Just more silence. And then, way down at the end of the narrow corridor, at the edge of the next car, something appeared that unsettled me precisely because of how *normal* it seemed.

It was the sound first, the metallic sound of wheels on iron, but not from the train itself, but something smaller, rhythmic, disturbingly familiar. A cart.

One of those meal carts that rolls down the aisles on long trips, with little bottles of mineral water and stale snacks, gliding without hurry, without anyone pushing it, moving straight toward us with a confidence that denied its apparent lack of control.

It came with a tray covered by a white cloth. No one pushing it. No one in sight. It stopped beside us. Precisely in the center between our two pairs.

No one said anything. No one dared to move. Jake held his breath. Amy placed her hand discreetly on my arm. I didn’t want to look, but I was already looking:

The cloth was damp, darkened at the edges. Drops of something thick, dark red, fell one by one to the floor.

And then it moved.

The cloth, as if something underneath it had decided to stretch its legs, formed two small, symmetrical bulges. Child-sized hands. They reached toward me and grabbed me.

I screamed, Amy screamed, Wes screamed, and I swear I saw Jake covering his eyes. I tried to break free, but couldn’t. The grip was strong, final, and I couldn’t get loose.

And the cart… breathed.

It didn’t make a sound. It didn’t shake. It breathed. Swelled, as if lungs existed beneath the metal. And the tray on top began to creak softly, rising and falling like a mouth, and then, the hands started pulling me toward it, as if about to bite me. The blood rushed out of my body and I felt like an ice cube. 

Jake stood up suddenly, ready to jump at the thing, when we heard the whistle. Not the train whistle, but the kind the station guards use.

The light changed, the entire train pulsed, like a muscle and I swear to God, the cart let go of me, turned. On its own. As if it had heard something at the end of the corridor. And it rolled back.

I was beyond myself, frozen. I heard Wes shouting something but didn’t process it, I only understood what he meant once they were already up and running toward the exit. Jake went first, then Amy, then Wes. I was last, stumbling on the way out, nearly caught between the doors. The platform was cold, wet, but more *real*.

The moment my feet touched the concrete, the train whistled again, like an enraged animal, and vanished.

It sped off toward the horizon, and I couldn’t even tell when it disappeared from view. The silence returned, but it wasn’t the same as before. It was a silence that vibrated in the bones, loaded with horror.

Amy huddled near a pillar, arms wrapped around herself. Jake looked stunned, sweat on his forehead, staring at the tips of his own shoes. Wes knelt down and pulled something from his pocket: the recorder, which had turned itself back on. He pressed play.

The sound that came out wasn’t the cart. Nor the conversation. It was heavy breathing, very fast, like something small trying to stay calm, and in the background, very faint… music*.*

*“One, two, nobody saw me…*  
*Three, four…”*

Wes turned it off. Said nothing.

I looked back toward where the train had been. The ground was clean, dry, except for two dark handprints. One on each side of the platform. As if something had braced itself to climb out.

Small hands. Parallel. Childlike.

The way back was silent. Jake drove slowly, slower than necessary, as if any speed over twenty miles an hour might tear through the fragile film of normality we were desperately trying to preserve. Amy was curled up in the back seat with her face turned to the window, her head resting against the fogged glass. Wes held the recorder like it could warm his hands. I watched the city’s streetlights pass by like ghosts. Each light seemed to last longer than it should, and even inside the car there was a coldness that didn’t come from the air.

We said goodbye without words, as if using language might summon something. As if naming what we saw was exactly what those things wanted. At the chapel, the candles had gone out, the hallway was darker than usual, and for a moment I considered sleeping with the lights on. I didn’t. I still had some pride left.

But sleep didn’t come either.

Every time my eyes started to close, the sound came back. Not the whistle, the sound of the cart, rolling over the metal floor, creaking softly, always approaching, always with that white cloth folded over the tray. At three in the morning, I sat on the bedroom floor and started to draw.

The seat.  
The marks.  
The hands.  
The cart.

And finally, I drew the children, based on the portraits from the newspaper.

When I finished the final line of the second girl’s face, the graphite snapped between my fingers. And that’s when I realized: **I knew that face**. It was subtle, but recognizable. Something in the structure of the cheekbones, in the expression. The girl in the drawing looked like someone I had known a long time ago.

The next day, I met with Jake and Wes at the diner near the old gas station, the one by the north entrance of the city. Amy didn’t show. Wes said she needed time. No one argued.

Jake was quieter than usual. He kept watching people come and go as if expecting someone to follow us. Wes brought a folder, again filled with papers, but more organized this time. We started comparing Ben’s notes with what we’d seen, trying to make sense of it. There, between diagrams and dates, Wes showed us a page that had gone unnoticed before. A clipping from an old newspaper. Dated 1993.

“**DISTRICT A LINE ACCIDENT**:  
*Derailment kills two children.*  
*Conductor survives and claims to have followed all protocols.*”

That was it. The origin of the two girls. But it was in the corner of the clipping that my eyes stopped. The name of the second child, the one I swore I recognized.

I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t breathe. I just pointed. Jake read it aloud and looked at me, confused. Wes caught on faster. He picked up the paper, read it again, and let it fall on the table.

*“Diana. Rawley.”*

Jake frowned.

*— But Rawley… like… Ben?*

I nodded, feeling my stomach turn over again.

*— He wasn’t trying to figure out what happened to the railway. He didn’t want to ask about Amy.*

Wes finished the sentence for me, in a whisper:

*— He wanted to know what happened to his sister.*
