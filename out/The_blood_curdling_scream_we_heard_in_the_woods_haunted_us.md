Me and two of my best friends, Shawn and Jeff, went hiking into the woods on a normal Saturday. This was not our first time nor second time hiking in these woods but it was definitely our last!

Everything was going pretty normal as usual, birds chirping and stuffs like that, so nothing was out of the ordinary. We had a lot of fun tho because we decided to explore new places in the woods and explore different species of small animals like squirrels and birds. It was around 6:25pm and it was already getting dark in the woods, we all decided it was time to head home so we turned around and started making our way out of the woods. 

We haven't stayed this late in the woods before, so Jeff decided to take advantage of the moment by asking stupid questions.

"What would yall do if we encounter a wild animal right now?" Jeff asked "Yall know they come out at night to hunt down preys"

"Bro there is no wild animal in this area. I'm more worried about a psychopath with a knife Hopping outta one of the trees" Shawn said, jokingly.

We all then started laughing and continued our journey, trying not to let any of those thoughts mess with our head.

We walked for a couple of minutes to the middle of our journey and we stopped to pee, and by that time it was getting even darker in the woods but we really needed to pee. 

While we were doing our business (peeing) we paused, when we heard rustling sounds from a far, but we don't know how far or from which direction the sounds were coming from but it was definitely footsteps of someone or something, and seemed like whatever or whoever it was were moving deeper into the woods because the rustling sounds slowly faded until we couldn't hear it anymore. Without wasting anymore time we decided to leave immediately, but we froze up in total horror when we heard a very loud blood curdling scream coming from somewhere in the woods which immediately sent chills to our spine. It was like a scream of someone being tortured, like that kind of scream you make when some part of your body is being slowly chopped off when you're still alive! It was like hearing someone burning in Hell!!. The screaming continued, and it was getting louder and louder!! Trust me it was so terrifying! It was the most terrifying thing i have ever heard! 

Without wasting anymore fucking time, we took off and we all started running for our dear lives. It was so terrifying!!. But finally we exited the woods and got home safe but the thought of that scream in the woods always send chills to our spine. 

What was that? Was it actually a person being tortured or just weird sound of a weird animal we don't know about? Or Is somewhere in that woods actually a secret location were psychopathic killers torture and kill their victims? Or was the making that footsteps attacked by a wild animal and started screaming in pain? We never know, But whatever it is we are just glad that we got of that places.

We quited hiking that day! We quited anything that has to do with the woods, including camping and other stuffs like that.
