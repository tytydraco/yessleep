She had the *skinny* bones.

Ones make Muddy Waters think he lucky. *Skinny Bones* is a metaphor for loaded dice. It was in common usage by degenerate gamblers, mainly in obscure parts of Ohio, during the era of prohibition. I have come by this particular trivia the harder than *hard sixes* way.

*Skinny bones* is when your luck is running on empty.

You see, Vera was into the loan sharks. Seven figures worth of **IOU**.

Some very ugly people from some very hard parts of Eastern Europe held the markers. That meant my betrothed bully had a custom crafted bullseye in a box coming her way. That box be requiring a signature. Return to sender would not be an option.

So, we thought it would be a good idea to lay low at the safe house by the lake. The one paid for in cash that nobody was supposed to know about. Well, turns out somebody knew.

And, as it also turns out, the loan sharks were making field collections. *Nocturnally*.

I knelt down to pray.

To whom?

Wasn't no Mrs. Robinson. No Joe Dimaggio. Hang if I know.

I heard crickets. Then I heard a twig snap. They would have night vision. Now it was a century later. Prohibition was over and no matter how cloudy they would hunt us down like an eagle at high noon.

Visions of Swiss pub cheese danced in my head. Only I was the cheese.

Vera held all the strings in our relationship. It’s always been that way.  Vera married me right after the final incident with Aunt Sandy. This is a long time ago. That's also a problem. Because whatever we think we know about the aging process needs to be revisited. I'm so jaded I bet Mr. Clean ain't.

Even Aunt Sandy old as dirt when I met her but look fresh as original sin.

Even though she about twice as dirty. Seem so obvious once I got to know her better.

*Dirty Old... Watch time and space unfold...*

Aunt Sandy owned everything in that factory town Vera grew up in. Little old town in Ohio back in the day. And Vera's Aunt Sandy, well, her *proprietorship* reached far, far beyond. We're talking OG squared. When men fear a woman. Know what I mean?

By the end of prohibition there's not much Buckeye that old Aunt Sandy didn't make a buck on.

But it’s not like she built it from scratch.

Genetic lottery. Butterfly effect. I'd like to introduce you both to the queen of corruption. Can you say Apex Predator?

That's how it boiled down.

Then things moved to some whole new level.

Then came Vera. Madge's daughter.

She was to be named Vera. It was Madge's last request uttered determinedly with her dying breath.

"Call her *Veraaaaaa*."

We won't candy coat things.

Vera was pure. Pure fucking evil. Not a kind fucking bone in her body. She was hot. In a lemon sucking brutally hot and humid day way.

The kind you get in July. And there's that ice cold water. But you can't reach it or drink it because some haughty broad with six shooters is holding you captive in her spell. Yeah. She's got all the lemons. And deep down you know you'll take her whisky. Sour.

Vera's birth? Religious people might call it original sin upgrading to demonic possession, first class. And her birth killed old Madge. Killed her deader than a swatted horsefly. Only it took a day or two. And nobody saw it coming. But baby Vera knew. Somehow.

But whatever evil or madness it was, well, I did more than bear witness to it. I was Vera's fool. Her rube. I was tied up tighter than a sailor's knot. And worst of all, Vera knew that.

It was only back in the 1940s when Vera turned 19 that she says she appeared to have stopped aging. Both her and her fucked up Aunt Sandy. She said they appeared to be rich. They appeared to be no longer aging.

When Vera was born Sandy said, "She got that black hole soul from her daddy, Roger. That child would put a spell on Satan himself," Aunt Sandy never tired of saying this. Takes one to know one I suppose.

Once Aunt Sandy told Vera a true player never plays herself. Vera pulled another wing from another fly. She looked nonplussed. Fuck the time and space fabric.

See, by that time Aunt Sandy could have saved her breath. By that time, Vera's hate for Aunt Sandy ran deeper than a Texas Wildcatter's drill.

Dirty old Rog.

Vera's daddy. Rog, who by saying, "I do," inherited the town council, police, district attorney, lock stock and both smoking barrels of corruption. All that just by marrying Vera's mom and Sandy's sister, Madge.

Unfortunately, after the grift got out of hand and word spread it was a lawless town things got rowdy enough so that decent women and children couldn't walk the streets on Sunday in broad daylight without witnessing all God's commandments being broken in broad daylight.

The body count grew faster than the undertakers could handle. That's about the time somebody got the bright idea to hire a lawman to clean up that dirty factory town.

His name was Bill Kane. A reformist they called him.

Marshal Kane was tall and looked hard as an axe handle.

He had dark hair cut short.

He was freshly shaved.

But no matter how many minutes it had been since the new marshal's last shave, he couldn't shake that perpetual 5 o’clock shadow.

The kind of shadow that said he might be dark and moody.

Said you might not really be wanting to meet Bill Kane in a dark alley. Maybe the one behind Ramirez' Saloon. Especially when you’re probably on the wrong side of Jesus Christ himself, too.

Anyway, Marshal Kane caught Ol' Rog in the act of simultaneously four flushing and back shooting. This was done to ensure his ongoing criminal enterprise would flourish. Certain *T-Totalers* needed to be totaling their last *T*. Ol' Rog's motto was fuck abstinence, let's bootleg.

This being early 1919, where lawless towns were now generally being frowned upon like the Spanish Flu, well that would mean no railroad action for the town, which meant no railroad money for the town, no real road construction for the town, less people coming to and from the town, less opportunities. That meant the town risked becoming a ghost.

Now Ol' Rog didn't quite see it that way as his bread was being buttered pretty good on both sides.

Everybody else could see the writing was on the wall.

Manifest Destiny. Tum-tum-tumbling weeds. Get with the times.

Sandy would concur. Sandy would say to a smoke filled back room of dark ugly men, "Let us not piss on the wheels of progress because they will piss back harder and longer and stronger. Practically speaking, that's why levers of corruption were first invented. To be pulled. And stop drinking that rotgut."

In plain folks speak this meant that the evasive and reclusive Kane was successfully brought out of retirement to clean up the town.

That meant old Kane felt authorized to end this foolishness by any means necessary. His means. It even was stated right in the contract he carried in his silk vest. The vest under one of his holsters.

This was something the town would have to have contractually agreed to in order to retain Kane's services.

But this time the town was intent on ending the era of foolishness as Sandy called it.

So, end that foolishness Kane did. What Kane also did in the process of foolishness removal was remove old Rog, Vera's father, from his earthly shackles, courtesy of Smith & Wesson. And then Kane took his money and disappeared forever.

Maybe Vera could have forgiven all that. Prohibition was a violent era. But when Vera discovered years later that somebody had tipped old Marshal Kane off, well that's when Vera made a quantum leap down Satan's slippery slope.

Somebody had told old Marshal Kane just where and when old Rog would be doing the devilish things vile men do when left unchecked.

That gave Marshal Kane time to drum up a posse.

*Old Rog meet boot hill.*

Now who could have given away old Roger, Vera oft wondered.

Who could have given away Madge's beloved she mused. Who could have betrayed her daddy leaving her an orphan?

Who knew Madge was pregnant with child?

Could it be a greedy old Aunt Sandy?

Did she know Madge would give birth then suffer postpartum depression so intense she jumped out the window of the maternity ward? A ward was located on the 12th story of the hospital.

Yes, Sandy had spilled the campfire beans it seemed. Somebody was floating old Marshal Kane's bounty. A King's ransom in gold. Town didn't have that kind of scratch.

Kane was the best. And the best did not come cheap.

They said Kane had been the top operator at Pinkerton but had gone off the reservation after losing his family to a vengeful criminal he had put away long ago.

Well, Kane found the man who killed his family.

Nobody knew what Kane had done to him. All anybody knew was that the man who killed Kane's family had vanished like the day before. Also, that a couple of days afterwards Kane left the outfit with only two words.

***I resign.***

Nobody ever said what happened, but everybody knew when Kane had a job to do the job got done. That's all there is. After that Kane sometimes took work from an old associate at the private outfit of Dark & Moody. They were pretty well connected, regional operators back in the day.

And, when push came to shove, old Rog protested the whole affair, corruption being his livelihood and lifestyle.

But, in the end, Kane's six shooter was no joke.

When all the gun smoke cleared, nobody could say there was much left of old Roger's liver, lily or otherwise, for any interested vultures to pick on.

Roger and Madge's deaths meant other things too.

For instance, now Aunt Sandy owned Madge's interest in an empire.

An empire of money, power, corruption, hired guns and gunsels and everything else that went along with it. No *splitskis*. Monopoly. Boardwalk and Park Place.

Sandy never quite trusting prohibition to last forever because what lasts forever decided to make some changes.

Sandy moved the bootlegging operation to the outskirts of town and was sure to make sure there was no shortage of grease on the right wheels at the major railroads. And with the major lawyers, politicians at every level, judges, law enforcement; just name it.

See how fast a lawless dirty factory town could appear to be modernizing yet be about to reach levels of corruption one could only dream of before prohibition money.

So, the grease worked, the railroads came through, and the town grew.

And the only cost being Rog and Madge. Fall guys. Crafty old Aunt Sandy inherited a bundle, and the town was born again. Vera was an orphan. Sandy would raise her.

Sandy was 19. Vera was a baby. And Aunt Sandy was her legal guardian.

By the time Sandy was thirty she was the not only the richest female bootlegger, but no McCoy, real or otherwise, was drank in her part of Ohio without tribute. Otherwise, it was time for hot lead and no questions.

And for every dollar at the factory Sandy got twenty-five cents. And she knew how to spread it around town.

Three years into prohibition Sandy's buckeyes were bucks up and she was looking to hold a piece of action in the very state of the state's heart. Putting a governor in her pocket.

And then there was the aging thing. Sandy. Vera. Let's do the time warp again. Old than sin but they looked the same. Aunt and niece, young and nice. Decades later.

By 1983 it seemed Sandy was perpetually stuck at fifty years old and Vera at nineteen.

A-O-Where'd-You-Go? Ohio.

...

So how does all this fit together with me marrying Vera thirty years ago and it being 2024 and there being mercs with night vision goggles and crazy video game rifles out by the boathouse?

I’ll tell you. But to tell you we got to go back. Back to:

1996, West Babylon, Long Island

My fucking dickhead half-brother, Seth, wins tickets to the Phish concert as a prank when I'm visiting his warehouse. That's my first concert experience story. I know we all got our first concert cherry busting stories, but I hope you can handle mine. That would put you one up on me.

My whole life he bullies me and now tries to make up for it with concert tickets.

Tickets he scams.

Ever since that night, roughly three shitty decades ago.

If only I hadn’t gone to see that Phish concert in ‘96.

If only my dickhead older brother hadn’t used his comic book mail order company’s six separate phone lines hooked up to Windows 3.1 speed dialer feature to DOS spam WBAB 102.3 FM.

But alas, the dickhead did it.

Yeah, he decides to flood WBAB on Long Island with enough calls to guarantee we weren’t just the whatever fucking number caller you were supposed to be to win a pair of tickets to the sold out Phish show, but that we were practically every caller.

So, we go to the concert and me, and dickhead get separated when he goes off with some Phishhead chick and don’t ask me how, but I get hooked up with some 19-year-old, older brotherly vibe dude, outside in the parking lot.

This dude looks like a big marine kinda mother and is the only dude in eyeshot with a crew cut.

Anyway, homeboy pulls out two tall boys from the inner pockets of his denim jacket and offers me one and I thank him kindly and accept the gesture.

That’s me polite, well-mannered and doomed to Satan’s couple counseling intensive doomshops.

Anyway, back to the Phish concert.

This dude not only gives me a Bud tallboy but also smokes a joint with me and then, when some rando neon neo-hippie dude comes by offering to sell us LSD in the parking lot, he asked me if I wanted to trip out.

Dude was nice enough to pay for my hit when I told him I never tripped before.

And when I told him my dickhead brother had ditched me for some phishy chick he suggested I hang with him because he knew one simple trick geeks in the good seats hate.

What’s the trick you ask?

I will tell you. Big brother finds two primo empty seats and says, “We good. Let’s get higher.”

So, as seats start filling up with phish heads eventually two willowy dudes with failed facial hair arrive.

The less willowy of the two kindly inform us both that we are in their seats.

Big brother asked to see their tickets more closely.

He asked the more willowy dude to see his ticket too.

Then, next thing I know he just snatches their tickets, hands them to me, then grabs them both by the wrist.

He then says, "Take our tickets. They're up in the nose bleeds. I see you punks again I'll put you in the hospital."

They just stare like deer in the headlights.

"You believe me?" he asks.

They just stare.

"I need to hear it or you'll be sleeping with the Phish."

They both say they believe him and scamper off.

So, the fucking concert sucks like a black hole but I discover 2 things.

Things I discovered.

1. Big bro says, “Yo. I got to say I don’t think this is LSD little brother. This is PCP. Angel dust. *Sherrrrrmmmmannnnnnnn*!”
2. I notice the girl in the seat in front of me. Her long, chestnut tresses mesmerize me.

Suddenly, Roger Rabbit was no longer a fever dream. It was phishy as phuck but this chick was calling me like a siren sweetly singing. She had to be my soulmate, I thought.

I’ve gathered all my courage to do God‘s will, and I gently caress her hair.

Suddenly she turns around, her face crimson fury. She smacks me once. She smacks me twice. She grabs me by the collar. Big brother looks down and starts laughing hysterically.

Boy, I'm in trouble now I think to myself.

This chick was uglier than Medusa herself. What a way to go. And I never even kissed a girl.

But she looked like she could fucking beat the shit out of me.

Whoever says angel dust is supposed to give you superhuman strength could fuck off. I was scared shitless.

And then a miracle happened.

The girl next to her turns around and, as if she’s under a halo, looks at the two of us and says, "By the name of the great Phish Pharaoh, I command thee, look upon me bitches!"

And then she did a curious thing. As if we had been transported to the French Quarter the girl flashed us her titties.

The sudden presence of two beautiful mammalian protuberances suddenly turned to three, but then returned to the customary two. I realized it might be the *Sherman* fucking with me.

Guess who was flashing?

Vera.

That’s who.

So yeah, back in 1996 a whole bunch of fucked up shit transpired to leave me to being tripping balls looking at my future wife’s titties and the very end of my relatively carefree, happy existence.

You see. Vera had decided then and there that I was the solution to her Aunt Sandy problem.

Nassau Colosseum collapsed into a cartoon extravaganza of fish, like in a big fancy fish tank as Vera began to kiss me.

My first kiss and I'm freaking on Sherman.

I’m not ashamed to say I lose it right in my Lee jeans. I guess Billie Jean was not my love.

So, we hung out and exchanged digits and before I knew it I was at Vera's house more often than not doing whatever she told me to do.

Vera looked at me one day after we smoke a joint and said, "I want you to be older so I can marry you. But first, first I guess we need to get you emancipated. But before that we gotta do some stuff. We got to make some moves."

I was putty in her hands.

Thus, less than one month later, crafty Vera arranged it so that while Aunt Sandy was surveying the damage to her Bentley shit was sure to go south.

Sandy had a fancy garage filled with expensive cars. And the garage had everything a service station could need because it doubled as one.

Vera had smashed the Bentley's windshield with a rock. Sandy's favorite ride.

And in that garage, well there's no nice way to say it, someone had, reminiscent of a scene from Scarface, and courtesy of Black & Decker, caused said Aunt Sandy to lose her head.

That someone was Vera, and I had witnessed the whole thing.

When it was over, Vera stood looking at me with the black and decker saw toothed wheel of fortune dripping crimson.

Vera laughed, and then she laughed some more.

“Do you know what the Aztecs used to do for fun,“ she asked me.

I shook my head like I was tasting something extremely sour. Sour and by surprise.

Vera dropped the chainsaw.

It echoed throughout the garage.

Then Vera did a strange thing. She showed me her boobies again.

She said, "Take those chains. The ones by the hammers."

I did and returned.

Vera turned her back on me.

I held one of the chains in my left hand.

“Well, I think you’re going to have to beat me, for a *change*. It's gotta look like self-defense and a freak accident.“

I just looked at Vera. I just looked at the forsaken chainsaw in my hand. And then I looked at Aunt Sandy. Her head lay at an odd angle about a foot from her neck.

Vera looked at me and said, “In for a penny, in for a pound. “

“Again, I ask you," Vera said. "Do you know what the Aztecs used to do for sport?”

I just shrugged. It was getting to be a long day.

Vera took a running step. And then she kicked Aunt Sandy’s head, launching it a good twenty feet. It finally came to rest near a bucket of oily Lugnuts.  That caused a Rube Goldberg situation, knocking over an open pan of dirty motor oil, which ended up covering Sandy‘s dead head pretty well.

Then Vera walked over to the head.

She took out a filterless cigarette from the pocket of a hoodie that said, "Boston University."

She got the smoke lit with a strike anywhere match.

She picked up a portable gas container and poured gas all over Sandy's decoupled head.

Then Vera blew a perfect smoke ring and dropped the burning match in Sandy's hair. It caught fire and the fire spread fast.

Sandy looked like Ghost Rider.

Vera did a little soccer thing with the flaming head, which also kept it from burning down the garage.

Finally, when it was cooked to her satisfaction, she let it come to a rest.

Then Vera told me to come over to her. We stood so close I could feel her breath.

Vera said that I was to beat her back bloody.

I was to lie to the police.

I was to say I witnessed Vera's abuse at the hands of Aunt Sandy multiple times before.

That I had gone to check out Aunt Sandy’s Bentley that day because I was thinking of going to automotive trades school. Except that when I arrive at the garage what I see is a deranged Aunt Sandy coming at Vera with the chainsaw.

I come in and scream, "What are you doing Aunt Sandy?"

And that’s when she slip and accidentally lose her head. And it get covered in gas and knock over a kerosene lantern. And, it do what heads do in those situations. It catch a fire.

“That’s the story you’re gonna tell,“ Vera said like she knew I would.

I nodded my head like we both knew I would.

And, that's the story I told to the Police, local and state. It was a big deal Aunt Sandy having so much juice for so long.

Well, after Vera fried Aunt Sandy's head she got her new lawyer to get now sixteen year old me emancipated. Then Vera's limo took us to Vegas where an Elvis impersonator married us.

After we got married Vera took me even more for granted.

Especially when she drank.

I knew things might now work out so well for me when Vera persuaded me at knifepoint to have, "Vera’s Bitch" tattooed on my ass.

I tried to petition for the more generic *Bitch Ass* but was vetoed.

Vera said, “You never gonna get rid of me. You just perish that thought there, little bitch ass.“

So, for the last 30 years, I have been Vera‘s bitch ass.

But this time? This time Vera had gone way too far over the line, the boundaries of reason, the line separating evil and pure madness.

Mistress Vera was on a bender to end all benders and there didn't seem to be much I could do about it.

So, what was the problem now here in an election year in 2024?

Vera turned out to be a degenerate, gambler and sloppy drunk. Vera would gamble on anything. Horses. dice. The roulette wheel. Boxing. It just didn’t matter.

What did matter was Vera was terrible at gambling.

And, when Vera had exhausted Aunt Sandy’s inheritance and all her credit and all her friends' largesse, my wife did a dopey thing.

Vera started borrowing money from the loan sharks, the Shylocks. The kneecap rearrangement experts. The ones with hard accents.

Currently, it seems, they are owed so much money that someone needs to make an example out of somebody.

Unfortunately, for Vera and I, that meant that there were now three Hummers outside our *secret* lakeside property.

Three Hummers of hard men in full combat gear sporting night vision outside our secret lakefront getaway property. It was the one even Vera‘s creditors didn’t know about because she had bought it with cash under a fake name.

Well, that’s it, in a nutshell, emphasis on nut. Fucking Phish.

I don’t know how this will end. Probably with me and Vera ventilated pretty good I imagine. Some fucking Bonnie and Clyde shit right here.

I don’t know how to fend off three hummers worth of mercs who are familiar with the cafeteria schedule at most Siberian gulags.

I didn’t even know how to establish boundaries with Vera.

If you're out there remember one thing.

Always maintain your boundaries because there's always a Vera lurking just around the bend.

Oh Vera, why must it always end this way? Cold hearts and hot lead and the big sleep.
