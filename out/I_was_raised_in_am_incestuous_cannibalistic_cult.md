I was raised in a cannibalistic, satanic, abusive, dangerous, manipulative environmental cult.

My entire life I was raised in a very strict ruled and very harsh punishmental lifestyle. I am keeping my identity private for obvious reasons.

I am a 17 year old male, I was born through invetro, my father had paid a woman he knew from high school to have me, had my birth mother sign away her rights when she was still pregnant with me, and wanted her to have absolutely no contact with me. She couldn't even hold me or see me after birth, I was specifically created and born to be my fathers romantic life partner, I have been my fathers property my entire existence.

I was promised to my father since before I was born, made to be his husband and not his son.
I was not allowed to call him dad, only by his given name, if not I would be severely punished for it. My father began having sex with me from a very early age, when I was just 13/14 years old, oral and intercourse.


It was very scary, confusing and extremely painful in the beginning. I didn't understand what was being done to me or why it was being done to me and all my father told me was that it was normal and that the pain would eventually go away and I would become used to how things were going to be from now on. He told me were in a relationship, that I was his and that I was made for him, created to be with him and only him. He told me I was his man. The most bizarre part is I ended up falling inlove with him.

Please. Bare with me, it's very difficult for me to remember everything over the Years, and all of the rules I have to follow, because of my religion, one of the rules being I cannot speak upon my religion at all to the outside world, but here I am anonymously breaking one of the biggest rules that can get me kicked out, if not killed.

We are usually called by city folk, hill people or ferals. The abandoned town my family took over years, decades before I was even though of is called shalmalian, it's deep up in the hills, far away from society, no running water but my family did find a way to illegal hook up electricity from the city lines.

My family cannot marry outside of the blood line, they set up traps down the hill a ways to catch the mountain runners who go on and off the dirt trail, we gag them, hog tie them and then drag them up the hill to put them in an underground cage, to kill them and eat them.

We make jewelry outta their bones, use their blood as wine that we mix with other things, like spices and such. We use the organs to make soups, use the arm and leg bones to make weapons also, and use the skull bone as bowls.

My father is a very stern, strict and angry man.
Everything I do I get punished for.

For example not cooking for him the exact way he wants me too, talking back to him, speaking without permission, or fighting him during sex.
I get punished by being physically beat, screamed at or withheld sex for days to weeks at a time, sometimes I get punished the exact opposite with extremely painful and rough sex.
I get punished for also crying every time we have intercourse. Because of all this I am always in pain, covered in bruises and am swollen all over. My father has threatened to kill me if I ever tried to leave him for somebody else or just leave in general.

I have friends where I am from, their all related to me in some way or another, all around my age, we spend time blowing up cars we find from past people our family has taken hostage and killed, and we also spend our time drinking and building new traps for us to be able to have new ways of capturing city people.

I have met my birth mother and stayed with her sometimes when my dad has to focus on work and cannot watch me or cannot have someone watching me. We both lied to my birth mother, she has no idea about our lifestyle, religion or place of living. I also have two half sister from my birth mother and a full blood sister that is my twin.
My dad kept me and my birth mother kept and raised my twin sister.

Please, don't try and convince me to leave my family or to call city police. I love my family and I'm happy where I'm at. I am simply just getting this off of my chest, leaving or calling authorities is not that easy. It is dangerous, nearly impossible, my family is reckless and  I don't want my life torn apart.

Feel free to ask any questions you may have, or are curious about knowing.
