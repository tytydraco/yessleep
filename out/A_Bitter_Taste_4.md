“I made this?” I ask Marie as I turn the vial, watching the milky fluid cling to the glass.

“Yes,” Marie says, her voice soft. “You called it Vivacen—from the Latin vivere, to live.”

“Vivacen. To live,” I repeat. “I invented a medicine? Did I go to college?”

She shakes her head, the movement delicate.

“You didn’t, no. But once you learned of the disease, you became determined. Obsessive, really. You taught yourself more than any university could have. And look around—” she gestures to the dining hall, the chandeliers above, the stained glass, the sheer size of the room we’re in.
“You did well. You did more than well.”

I don’t believe this. I’m not capable of this. Did I really change so much in so few years? 

“So I invented this… and sold it?” I ask, still watching the vial, as if the answer might emerge from the liquid itself.

“No, you sold other things. But this… you kept this secret.” 

I look up, shocked.

“Why?” I ask. “Wouldn’t this help people? If it really works?”

She hesitates.

There’s something strange in the way her face stiffens—her mouth pressing thin, her eyes darting downward as if ashamed on my behalf.

“You had your reasons.”

That’s all she gives me.

“And you were okay with that?”

That question lands like a slap. Her mouth opens, closes again. Her eyes sharpen.

“I always supported you!” Marie says sharply. “And how dare you question his decision!” Her eyes flash with fury.

“You mean MY decision?” 

Her face drops, and she looks lost for what to say. Then her expression hardens. She rises to meet me, face to face.

“You’re NOT him,” She says, pressing a finger to my chest, scowling in my face—voice full of venom.

I turn and walk from the room. I hear her calling out to me as I go from the dining room and back into the main hall—looking for an exit. I can’t handle this. What the hell is wrong with her? 

Is something wrong with me?

I need to get some fresh air. Hell—I need to get to a hospital, see if I even have this disease she claims I have.

In the main hall, opposite the stairs’ landing, is a large set of double doors. I stride across the hall, and throw the doors open. 

I’m greeted with a foggy courtyard. A large fountain stands in the middle of a cobblestone plaza, a hedge maze going off in all directions. The smells of dirt and grass waft in.

“Wait!” Marie shouts as her steps behind me quicken. “It’s not safe!”

I step out, shut the doors behind me, and walk toward the maze.

The hedges are well kept, rising at least three heads above me—there’s no way to see past them. They form towering hallways of shrubbery. 

The fog blinds me—I’m left wandering in near silence, turning back at each dead end. 

The maze is deathly silent—only my footsteps on the soft, slick grass break the stillness. Marie must not have followed me—that worries me.

I realize that the medicine is still in my hand, the white liquid swirling with each step. I raise my arm to throw it—but hesitate.

What if I do need this? What if she wasn’t lying? I mean, she had some for herself and she didn’t follow me out here. Could she really have been telling the truth?

I press on regardless, wandering as the sun rises and thins out the fog. I lose count of how many times I loop back, returning to the courtyard more than once—to my frustration.

The only other landmarks are the occasional bench. Rusted and warped, they dot the maze, offering no real comfort.

Upon reaching another dead end, I turn—and I freeze at what I see. 

Down—far down a hallway of hedges, a figure stands, obscured by the fog. Tall, and dark, it towers over the greenery, clearing them by its shoulders. Its arms are long, stretched past its knees.

It hunches over, placing its hands on the ground. I spin around to face the hedge wall. I hurl myself into the hedge, clawing and forcing my way through.

I force myself through, nearly tumbling end over end as I spill out the other side. Ahead, the path splits in two, green hallways extending into the fog on either side of me.

To my absolute horror and dread, the creature effortlessly leaps over the hedge, and drops silently, landing just to my right.

The figure is closer now, and I can see it unobscured.

It’s a black-haired wolf-creature, towering upright on its hind legs. Its body is stretched and warped into that of a man’s, but one impossibly tall. 

A mane of long black hair drapes over the monster’s head, covering up part of its long and thin muzzle. Its eyes are small and blue—human, ones that reflect a deeper understanding.

I try to run, but my legs freeze in terror. As I stare at the beast, a low growl escapes from it, causing me to step back. The growl is warbled, and deep. And after a beat, my mind processes that it was speech.

“Master?” It asks.

But now, as it looks in my eyes, seeing the fear and confusion—I see a look of realization and understanding before it smiles, baring a muzzle full of square teeth.

“Not master,” It growls.
