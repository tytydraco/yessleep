The Hunger Grass situation had gotten far worse before it had gotten better. And it's still not entirely resolved. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U) 

On a mundane trip to the grocery store, I was confused to see that the milk and cream aisle was devoid of the local brand I usually get. Not a single carton in stock. When I asked one of the employees about it, her eyes widened.

“You didn't hear?” She asked incredulously. “There was a recall! I guess some sort of illness broke out amongst the cows and farmhands.”

A recall? *Them?* Strange. One of the reasons why I buy their products is because I know for a fact that they take good care of their animals. They’re pasture raised, hardy, grass-fed animals. You can drive right by the place and see healthy cows wandering around rather than being trapped in some pen, knee deep in their own feces.

Hold on. Grass. *Oh no.*

“Really?” I asked uneasily, hoping that I was overreacting.

My hopes went unanswered. “Yeah. Guess a bunch of the cows died from it. They all just started losing weight suddenly, even though they were still eating. People are saying it's some sort of parasite.” 

*Shit.* I thanked the lady numbly as I darted to the back to get a bribe for a certain Huntsman while pulling my phone out to call Victor.

We'd later learn that this farm wasn't the only one affected by the Hunger Grass. There was also a beef recall. Rumor has it that it was from a similar outbreak miles from my go-to. As a result, the shelves in our local grocery have been looking pretty barren. Between potentially contaminated items being pulled off the shelves and people panic-buying supplies, I had to go out of town to get a few necessities. 

What this told me was that the placement of the Hunger Grass was deliberate. The Neighbor that did this knew *exactly* what it was doing and the widespread carnage it would cause. 

While it was reasonable to assume that the Grass had been planted in the pastures where the cows graze, it would've been impossible for anyone at Orion to differentiate it from regular ol' grass. And the last thing we needed was for one of us to get cursed, especially since we weren't sure if it would affect the Dead Duo. I don't think I need to explain why a vampire or a draugr being afflicted with insatiable hunger would be a *terrible* thing. 

In other words, we needed the help of a Neighbor to locate it, and *fast.* Before more people or animals came into contact with it. Or the one responsible decided to keep planting it elsewhere. 

When Victor answered, I didn't waste any time, “The Hunger Grass is at Rustic Acres.” 

He sighed heavily, “Oh, great. That's just… well, *shit.*”

“Couldn't have said it better myself,” I grabbed a pretty bottle, thinking it'd be suitable, then went to the checkout. “I'm gonna head over to the mechanic’s shop, if that's alright with you. See if I can get him to lead me there now. And I'm getting another offering to see if he has any information on what could be responsible.”

“Good. But on that note, since we don't know the full scale of what we're dealing with, I don't like the idea of you going alone. I'm sending Wes to meet you there.”

Frowning, I pointed out, “The last time he and the banjo bastard saw each other, they literally tried to kill each other.” 

Victor reasoned, “Well, I'm about to meet up with the Department of Wildlife, so I can't go. The mechanic will get testy if I send Deirdre, plus she can't drive. Reyna's scared of him, which we both know that fucker will have a field day with, and I'd rather not put her in that position. So, who does that leave?”

“Fine,” I replied, using two fingers to pick up a loaf of bread, which I then dropped. As I crouched to retrieve it, I grumbled, “Just know that it's probably going to get ugly.”

He ignored that last gripe, “Meeting's about to start. Call me back if something happens.”

The two most bloodthirsty nonhumans I know working together. What could possibly go wrong?

The company truck was already sitting in the shop's parking lot when I arrived. The first thing I said to Wes when he got out was, “If you can play nicely with the other kid, there'll be an ice cream and pizza party for the whole class.”

He snickered, “The only thing I can promise is that if a fight breaks out, it won't be because I was the one starting it.”

“Okay.” I said doubtfully. 

“Finishing the fight, on the other hand…”

“*Wes.*”

When we got inside, we found Iolo dealing with a difficult customer. To the mechanic’s credit, there were no traces of irritation in his neutral expression. 

This might be a controversial opinion, but there is not a single professional actor out there that can compete with the performance of someone who has to work with an ornery member of The Public. Despite the mechanic’s convincing mask, I knew him well enough to be certain that he was considering hunting this customer for sport. 

The jagoff customer was waving his phone in the air, speaking slowly and condescendingly to the captain of the Wild Hunt as if he were an idiot, “I got a voicemail!”

“Sir, did you listen to the voicemail?” Iolo asked calmly. 

The guy hesitated before spitting defensively, “Well, you always leave a voicemail when it's done, so I just came right here.”

I heard Wes let out a soft scoff next to me. This interaction was familiar to us both. We get dumbasses like this at Orion, too. 

“Well, you see, I was callin’ to let ya know I had to order a part, so it's gonna take a bit longer than what I originally said.” The mechanic patiently explained, leaning forward onto the counter, hands clasped. 

The guy roughly shoved his phone into his pocket as he huffed, “So, I had my wife take time out of her day and drive me all the way here for *nothing* is what you're telling me?”

Customer service, everybody. 

Iolo shrugged, “Well, sir, that would be why I left a message.”

“Don't be a smartass!” The guy bitched. “Just let me know when it's done!”

The mechanic gave him a bright smile, “Will do!”

After that, the guy stormed past us, almost running into Wes, and slamming the door on his way out like a mature adult. During the overgrown toddler's tantrum, Wes and I just exchanged a look. 

“He seems delightful.” I remarked.  

Still smiling, Iolo said in a falsely cheery tone, “Oh, he'll be even more delightful once his heart stops. I'll make damn sure o’ that.”

Beginning to feel *marginally* bad for the guy after that remark, I changed the subject, presenting the cognac as I approached the counter, “Would you mind guiding us to the Hunger Grass as soon as possible?”

He eyeballed the bottle in my hand before asking the most alarming possible question: “Which patch?”

I blinked at him, “There's more than one?”

“Yup.” He confirmed as he took the cognac from my hand. “Someone is *very* pissed and for good reason.”

“That reason being?” Wes prodded impatiently. 

Iolo glanced at him with the same amount of disdain normally reserved for obnoxious children screaming in a grocery store, then redirected his attention back to me, “*Anyways,* you familiar with that housing development? Keeps growin’ and growin’ each year like a fuckin’ cancer? If I recall, Briar took a couple of contractors workin’ for ‘em a few months back.”

Yinz remember the False Tree incident? Same development company. There were grumblings amongst townies that they were wanting to expand again. Like last time, there were protests and petitions to stop it. Unfortunately, it appears that what those in charge took away from that situation wasn't to leave the forest alone in general, it was to leave only *that* patch of woods untouched. When they look at those tall trees that shade us in the hot summers and paint lovely, colorful waves for us in the autumn, they only see undeveloped land. Money waiting to be made. 

Whoever was in charge of this company needed to be contacted, and quickly. This had gone far beyond the last incident that they’d incited, affecting the entire county as opposed to just one small area. 

The mechanic seemed a tad annoyed when I asked to be excused to call Victor back, but allowed it. I left him and Wes alone to relay all of this to the boss. 

Once again, the boss sounded tired, “You gotta be fucking kidding me. *These* people again?”

“You'd think that they'd learn by now,” I lamented. “It’s not just ‘local superstitions.’ Aren't they curious about why so many of their construction crews get attacked or why their residents have to call us at least once a week?”

“As long as they don't have to deal with it themselves, they don't care.” Victor snapped, but then after a beat, his tone abruptly became mysterious. “Actually, that gives me an idea. A bad one.”

Apprehensive, I questioned, “What is it?”

“If I tell you, you'll try to talk me out of it, and you would be right to.” 

Well, that was promising. 

He continued, “I want you to focus on clearing up the Hunger Grass. In the meantime, I need you to trust me.”

I did and told him so.  

On another note, I'm going to go on a brief tangent since I know a few of yinz were rightfully concerned about Victor's well-being after the events described in the last post. 

A few days back, the boss opened up about what happened on the night of the Mare's visit: Briar had caught Victor under a patch of mistletoe growing on an oak tree. Out of respect for the boss, I won't go into details, so I'll just summarize by saying that the kiss was a bit more heated than what the mistletoe tradition usually calls for. 

At least from what Victor had described, Briar has some concept of consent, unlike the mechanic. The bar for the Wild Huntsmen is in the Hadal zone. 

“What in the hell is wrong with me that I could be attracted to someone like him?” He'd asked when we had this talk, eyes distant. 

In an effort to be comforting, I'd told him, “I honestly don't think it says anything negative about you. Don't you think you're being a bit too hard on yourself?”

“How could it not?” He replied. “When I was with them, I got to see Briar at his worst. Making thorns the size of knives grow out of people's skin. Piloting their bodies using vines that burrow into their muscles.”

That made me grimace. *Christ.*  

“Yeah, that's… horrible. I did not want to know that he could do that, and I'm sorry that you had to see it. But at the same time, the attraction still kind of makes sense to me, oddly enough. You're not human anymore. And between managing a place like Orion and your dietary needs, there's no way I could see it working out with a regular person.”

He nodded slowly, chewing my words over. 

While he was doing so, I added, “And besides the short temper and casual violence, Briar does have a couple of redeeming qualities. For one, it is with deep regret that I have to admit that he is kind of funny sometimes.”

“He quoted that damn ‘Mesothelioma’ commercial at me before the kiss.” Victor admitted flatly, and goddammit, I snorted.

“Fucking Briar.” Was all I could say to that. 

He wryly agreed, “Yeah. Fucking Briar.”

So, in summary, Vic is alright, just conflicted. Understandably, he's got a lot to sort through, when it comes to that. 

Anyways, the Hunger Grass. Before hanging up to do whatever risky thing he was planning, Victor reemphasized that resolving the Hunger Grass infestation took precedence over everything else. As such, if I needed back up, Reyna and Deirdre would be on standby. And if a client had to wait to get a regular, non-emergency call resolved, then so be it. 

When I reentered the mechanic’s shop, I walked into Wes rolling his eyes and sniping, “Okay, Tinkerbell.”

*What the hell happened while I was outside?*

Iolo let out a short laugh, eyebrows raised, “That the best you got, boy? Just as mediocre with words as you were with that sword. Couldn't even tell I was fuckin’ with you.”

Coolly, Wes responded, “You talk real tough for someone I could kill with a can of Raid.”

While Iolo cackled, shaking his head, I interjected, “Okay, I don't know what was said or done while I was talking to the boss, but we have more important matters to attend to. Can we please focus?”

That was an odd experience, me having to play the peacekeeper instead of being the one in an argument with the mechanic. I felt like a fish that had washed onto land while two squirrels were squabbling over an acorn. 

“Alrighty,” The mechanic said after staring Wes down with a smirk. “Let me lock a few things up, then we'll head out.”

Wes gave him a sardonic grin, “Meet you out there.”

Once we were outside and I was confident that the banjo bastard wouldn't be able to overhear, I demanded to know what happened while I was away. 

Clearly still irritated, Wes replied, “The usual. Dragonfly was being himself, and I didn't put up with it.”

Sounds about right. 

“He knows you've got a chip on your shoulder,” That was when the pot (me) whispered to the kettle (Wes), “Try not to let him goad you.”

Slowly, Wes turned to me to raise an eyebrow, wordlessly pointing out the hypocrisy of my statement. 

“Yeah, I know,” I agreed. “That’s pretty rich coming from me. I'll be the first to admit that I let him get under my skin more often than I should. But the last thing we need is to piss him off before we can take care of this infestation.”

“You're right. Which is why I'll wait until *after* we're done dealing with the evil grass.”

My eyes narrowed suspiciously. “For *what?*”

The conversation was cut off when we heard the shop's door shut. Once the mechanic got done closing up his shop, fiddle case in hand, he sauntered to his truck. That gave me pause. Why that instead of the banjo? While I doubted that he'd give me a straight answer, I was tempted to ask about it once we reached our destination. 

It's not like I can call him the fiddle bastard. That just sounds… *wrong.* Very wrong. Fiddle fucker? Nope. That's infinitely worse. 

I should delete that, but I'm not going to. Enjoy that window into my mind, everybody. 

When we got back to the company vehicle, I was relieved to see that Wes’ hagstone was in the glovebox. I made him take it, not putting it past Iolo to retaliate over that ‘Raid’ comment. I also made sure to bring the bread with us, not just to dispel the curse, but in case we encountered the Hungry Man again. I wasn't sure how the emaciated Neighbor would react if he caught us trying to get rid of his home. 

However, I was wondering if his situation was similar to Deirdre’s. What if he didn't want his tie to the Grass? Maybe he was trapped, just like how she was? Since I'd only encountered the Hungry Man once, I didn't have much to go off of. This was pure speculation. 

“Any idea of what could be waiting for us?” Wes questioned on the way there. 

I shrugged helplessly, “Not really. According to our records, many different types of Neighbors could've been the ones responsible, from a Weeper to a Muse. So, unfortunately, we’re probably going to end up learning the hard way.”

“That’s nothing new for us.”

There's a part of me that wishes we could go back to dealing with simple things. Neighbor infestations that could easily be resolved with some cream and a line of salt. However, in the long run, I suppose it's better that Orion has been pushed to contend with more powerful and complicated dilemmas. Just a few months ago, we might not have known where to start when it comes to a Hunger Grass outbreak. 

The blue truck's brake lights and turn signal snapped me out of my thoughts. We were passing Rustic Acres, taking a neglected back road a bit past the farm. That one was expected. Now, it was just a matter of where on the property the cursed thicket was located. And avoiding trespassing charges. 

The mechanic had parked on the shoulder, explaining that we were going to trek through the woods to get to the pasture to avoid that very scenario. Okay. Good thing I dressed warm. This polar vortex has turned Pennsylvania into a frozen hellscape. 

While following him towards the pasture, I inquired about the fiddle case, “No banjo today, huh?”

“Nope.”

Strange. Normally he loves to hear the sound of his own voice. While we were about to trespass, his unusual quiet didn't seem like it was due to any desire for stealth. The mechanic's eyes harbored more intensity than usual as he marched us towards our destination, mouth drawn in a strict line. 

He was ready for a fight. Against what, I wasn't sure. But if it was enough to put *Iolo* on edge, that made me uneasy. I kept a hand on Ratcatcher, ready to draw it, if needed. At the same time, Wes also kept alert, listening keenly to our surroundings. 

A cow's loud grunt greeted us as we crossed the threshold of the forest to infiltrate their pasture. When I saw the animals, I teared up. And before I get into why, I’ll warn yinz now: it neither started well, nor ended well for them. This was a bad case for us. Proceed with caution. 

Their eyes bulged from their sockets, wet with anguish. Like they were pleading for help as best as they could. Their coats, thick for the winter, were dull, showing the spikes of their ribs beneath. Many of the unfortunate cattle didn't have the strength to stand, their breathing labored and shallow as if they had given up and were now simply waiting to die. A few already had. 

*God, those poor things.*

Shouldn't they have been euthanized? Maybe the sheer number of illnesses between the cows and staff made it so that the farm simply couldn't keep up. 

After having to pass by too many more starving, miserable cows, Iolo suddenly raised an arm to stop me in my tracks. 

He then curiously asked Wes, “Can you see it?” 

Wes admitted that he couldn't. Experimentally, he also checked through the hagstone. Once again, the Hunger Grass was indiscernible from the rest of the pasture to us both. The stone hadn't even vibrated in its presence. 

“How can we tell that this is really it?” Wes questioned. 

The mechanic smirked, “By all means, step forward, if you don't believe me.”

I felt the need to remind them again, “*Not* the time. First of all, we are trespassing, and second of all, something does *not* feel right here.”

Still holding onto that punchable smile, Iolo replied, “You are *no* fun today.”

Unbelievable. When I'm snarky, he bitches. When I'm trying to keep things under control, he *still* bitches. I can't fucking win. 

There was work that needed to be done. Without responding to him, I removed pieces of bread from the baggie, trying to think of the best way to sprinkle the crumbs. 

“Where *specifically* are the boundaries of the Grass?” I asked. 

To my astonishment, the mechanic withdrew the fiddle’s bow from its case, using it to draw a line in the snow-covered ground in front of me with a derisive snort. In a shocking turn of events, *Iolo ap Huw* was actually being cooperative, for once. 

In the dull gray winter mist, the bow appeared to be made of gold. Once the violin was removed, I saw the entire instrument in its opulent glory. Its gilded face was accentuated with an intricate laced pattern. A completely different design than the banjo. 

“I appreciate it.” I muttered to him before dumping crumbs on the ground contained within the line he'd drawn. 

Without much banter, Wes and I worked together on that while Iolo started playing the instrument. At first, I tensed up, waiting for something to come of it. Nothing did. Not that I could see, anyways. The cows all watched him, some letting out deep *moos* as if trying to sing along. Some could call this a *cowcaphony.* (If you hate me for that one, I understand.)

There aren't many positives I can say for the mechanic; he is responsible for a lot of mental and physical scars, wounds that I'm confident will never fully fade away. But one of the few redeeming qualities that the Huntsman has is that he bears an effortless talent when it comes to music, whether it's with the fiddle or the banjo. While the violin’s notes came with the refined skill of a surgeon using a scalpel, his face remained relaxed as if such talent came as naturally as breathing to him. 

I'd learn afterwards that this song was intended to keep away human onlookers. The herd’s serenade had unintentionally alerted the Rustic Acres employees to our invasion, but as soon as the mechanic’s tune started, all was forgotten. 

Once the affected area was covered in a blanket of crumbs and pieces of torn-up whole wheat, I started watching the cows intently for any changes. If the records we'd found regarding these infestations were accurate, then it should've lifted the curse on them. However, the cows continued to gaze at us, the hollow sockets housing their gleaming eyes making them appear more like a distant memory of cattle. The one closest to Wes had begun to drool, long strings dangling from its dirty mouth.

“Hey, are these guys-” Wes started to ask. 

Before he finished, there was one sharp note from the fiddle and the snow was painted red. 

One by one, the heads of the herd rolled to the ground, eyes wide, tongues lolling limply from their wide mouths. Their bodies joined them, knees crumpling as if they were hoping that if they could rejoin their skulls in time, they could become connected once again. 

As I stared in speechless, wide-eyed horror, Iolo calmly said, “That shit you read about curses gettin' broken? Wishful thinkin’. Them cows were either gonna die a slow, painful death, or they were gonna start fixin' for somethin' other than grass. You gettin’ me?”

I thought of the way that the cows had watched us. Still. So still. Salivating as if we were the tastiest things they'd ever seen in their lives. As stupid as it sounds, I hadn't considered the possibility that anything other than a human could become a Hungry Man-style revenant. 

Suffice to say, Orion’s entries on the Hunger Grass will be getting a *massive* update once all of this is resolved.

Wes turned on him, “You could've said something sooner!”

“Yeah, but would you fuckers've listened?” Iolo asked, completely unruffled as he carefully set the instrument back in its case. 

*No. Probably not.* 

It wasn’t that I thought the mechanic was being dishonest; if he was saying it, he at least believed that he was telling the truth. It’s more that one of the core values of Orion is to resolve these infestations with as much compassion as possible. However, if there was absolutely no way to cure the Hunger Grass’ sickness, then what he’d done *was* the most compassionate thing. Their bleak alternatives were either to continue wasting away until their bodies gave out, like those laying in the field I mentioned earlier, or wandering the Earth in an eternal primordial hunger. 

That led me to my next awful realization: if there was no hope for the cows, then there most likely wasn’t any for the humans who’ve been cursed as well.

Seeming to have read my mind, Iolo drew closer and murmured, “I’ll take care of it. You and yours ain’t any good to me on death row.”

I’d expected him to make some sort of comment about my father. To dig at that old wound with a smile on his face, nonchalantly telling me I’d be following in the sperm donor’s footsteps, or perhaps that he’d thought that mass murder would come naturally to me. But it didn’t happen; he seemed bound and determined to surprise me as much as possible that day. 

Naturally, I hated this outcome, not wanting to accept that there was no way we could help any of the afflicted. There had to be something we could do. I wasn’t willing to just give up so easily.

Regardless, we did our due diligence and doused the affected area in lighter fluid before setting it ablaze, sticking around afterwards to make sure the fire died without spreading elsewhere. If the bread crumbs weren’t sufficient to break the curse over the afflicted, then their ability to clear the infestation was doubtful. We couldn’t afford to leave anything to chance.

Wanting to update Victor on the situation, I gave him a call after I got back to the truck on our way to the next thicket. We left sweet-smelling smoke behind us, as well as the carnage. 

The mechanic didn’t seem concerned about anyone finding either. Considering that no one ever appeared to notice all of the times he'd left my apartment covered in blood, I figured that this would go the same way. It wouldn't get traced back to any of us as long as he didn't want it to. 

On the way to the next site, Wes questioned if anyone, such as some sort of government entity, would come sniffing around after all of these deaths. To tell the truth, I wasn’t really concerned. Listeria outbreaks have been making headlines for the past year across the United States. What was yet another deadly, food-borne outbreak, especially in a region like ours? No one gave a damn about the problems - atypical or otherwise - in Mercer County before the Hunger Grass. Why would they start now?

When I called Victor, curiously, it went straight to voicemail. Either his phone was dead or he’d shut it off. 

I tried Deirdre next. With how knowledgeable she is, there was always the slim chance she'd know some miraculous way to help the sick that the mechanic hadn't considered. It couldn't hurt to try. 

Because of this quality, she's found her niche at Orion as our secretary. Not only is she able to help many clients resolve atypical cases all on their own, she is also a lot better at dealing with the clients than anyone else. 

What does it say about my colleagues and me that a former Weeper, who spent most of her existence trapped in a river, has better social skills than any of us? Probably nothing good. Of course, it also doesn’t hurt that she has a devastatingly cute voice, but of course, I’m objectively biased.

“Orion Pest Control, how may I assist you?” Her spiel was so darling; the charming way that she rolls her R’s was almost enough to distract me from the category five shit storm ripping up Mercer County. Almost.
 
Grimly, I told her, “The bread crumb method didn’t work.”

Her end of the phone got quiet for a moment as she processed the bad news. I continued, telling her about the cows, how the mechanic had put them out of their misery, and his intention to ‘take care’ of the people who’d been affected. As she relayed everything I said to Reyna, there was hushed commotion from the other end of the line.

“Alright,” Deirdre eventually muttered, sounding thoughtful. “You keep doing what you’re doing, Nessa. Just focus on that. But once you’re finished, if you can, try to distract the mechanic for as long as possible. Reyna and I are going to see if there’s anything we can do before having to resort to *that.*”

There was some muffled rustling, then Reyna’s voice was in my ear. “He only said that *he* didn’t know if there’s a way. That doesn’t mean that it’s impossible. I mean, I don’t know if anything that I have will fix this, but that’s not gonna stop me from trying.”

I sighed with relief, “I was hoping you’d say that. I believe in you.”

“Thanks, bestie.” She replied, then jokingly added. “And I’m going to remember this incident the next time a *certain someone* tells me to go touch grass! You hear me, you *blood-sucking bitch?!*”

Wes had begun to snicker from beside me. That was a yes. 

The next Hunger Grass location was at one of the local beef farms. This time, we didn’t bother with the bread, going straight to burning while Iolo gave the cows their last performance. Once again, we weren’t bothered by anyone or anything. 

That struck me as odd. Where was the Hungry Man? Or the one who’d planted the Grass in the first place? Not that I wanted a fight with either, but surely, they’d have a problem with what we were doing. 

Once all was said and done there, Iolo informed us that there was only one more thicket to take care of. 

This patch of Grass was located near the construction site the mechanic had mentioned. A sign out front boasted about their unwanted project, a cookie cutter neighborhood that was going to be called The Avalon. The sign had been vandalized with red spray paint reading ‘GET FUCKED!!!’ and a poorly drawn penis beneath it. 

Trees had been cleared out, leaving large piles of dug-up dirt by a freshly paved cul-de-sac. The houses were just beginning to be assembled, mere wooden skeletons set upon their foundations. 

When the mechanic got out of his truck, he pretended to be joking as he told Wes, “Hey, if you happened to drop some of that there lighter fluid on one of these houses, and *also* just happened to drop a match, I might grant ya a blessin’!”

Wes gave the construction project a scornful look. “**Very** tempting.” 

Grinning wickedly, Iolo encouraged, “Nothing like a little arson to spice up an evenin’.”

*I guess that’s one way to distract the mechanic once we’re done clearing up the Grass.* 
*Disclaimer: if any law enforcement reads this, I was only kidding… I promise. 

“You two can commit all the crimes you want once we finish this.” I said, sounding a bit too much like my mother for my own comfort. It gave me a minor crisis. 

Iolo clicked his tongue at me, “Dangerous words, Fiona!”

“You say that as if you don’t violate the Geneva Convention on a weekly basis.” I retorted, following him as he began to lead us to the last spot.

“Oh, a little torture builds some character. Take you, for example. You were fuckin’ insufferable before all this, but now…” He paused, considering before he completed his thought with a chuckle. “Well, on second thought, you’re *still* a pain in my ass.”

*Yeah, same to you, fucker.*

The final Hunger Grass infestation was located a few yards away from some construction equipment, left to sit in preparation to create lots for what was sure to be more soulless greige residences. Bitterly, I thought about how if ‘The Avalon’ was causing this much havoc before even a single house was fully assembled, Orion was going to be up to its neck in calls once people started moving in. That’s how it went with the last suburb, after all. 

Yinz may be wondering why all these houses are being built in a place that is so economically downtrodden. Simply put, the cost of living is cheap. A nice-sized house with a decent amount of land costs the same out here as it does to rent a bougie apartment in downtown Pittsburgh. And with the exception of the Neighbors, it’s a relatively safe place to raise a family. 

Once again, the mechanic used the bow of his violin to point out where Wes should pour the lighter fluid. While that was being taken care of, that was when I finally saw *him.* 

With how skinny and dirty he was, the Hungry Man had blended seamlessly into the trees. He stood with his clay bowl, simply watching, having to lean heavily against the birch beside him to keep from collapsing. 

As a precaution, I’d kept two slices in my pocket in the off chance that I touched the Grass during this ordeal. Since we were almost done, I figured it couldn’t hurt to spare one. Even while knowing that this offering wouldn’t help to relieve his starvation, he just looked *so* weak. 

Feeling Iolo’s eyes on me, I approached the Hungry Man slowly, holding one of the slices out to him. The Hungry Man held his bowl out with a shaking hand. Gingerly, I placed the bread inside then quickly withdrew my hand. Fingers trembling violently, he reached within to begin picking at it.

“I remember you from before,” He grunted between bites, his voice hoarse. “Is this offering given on your behalf or someone else’s?”   

“Uh, mine.” I replied, then asked apprehensively. “Does the bread help at all?”

The Hungry Man quickly finished the rest of his snack, replying, “Not in the way you would think.”

Politely, I asked, “Would you mind elaborating?”

“Throughout my damnation, I have grown to appreciate flavors like no other,” He flashed his incongruously perfect teeth in a smile as he slumped against the tree once more, “Haven’t you noticed how even something as simple as a slice of bread tastes exquisite when you’re ravenous?” 

“I never would have thought of it that way,” I mused.  

Head lulling weakly on his neck, he languidly cast a look at Wes and the Fiddle Bastard. Following his gaze, I could see that both were waiting for me. Wes looked concerned, matchbook in hand, ready to intervene if the Hungry Man became aggressive. Meanwhile, Iolo was glaring at me impatiently. 

Cold, bony fingers wrapped around my wrist, startling me. Then the Hungry Man’s other hand covered my eyes as he muttered, his voice echoing in a way that made it sound as if I were surrounded by an army of starving revenants. Through that cacophony, I distantly heard Wes, but couldn’t make out what was being said.

The Hungry Man’s hands fell away limply as he released me, saying only, “Use it well.”

Before I could get my bearings and figure out *what the fuck just happened,* the match was lit, igniting the Hunger Grass. The smell of charred flesh soon followed as the Hungry Man began to burn along with the thicket. Absurdly, his eyelids shut as he tilted his chin up towards the sky with a joyous smile. I stepped back, bile rising in my throat at the sight and smell.

As the flesh melted off of his bones, the Hungry Man breathed, “*Finally.*”

He lit up like a candle, flames consuming every inch of his being as skin gave way to stringy muscles. The heat on my face was intense, a smouldering wall of blistering warmth. A hand on my shoulder pulled me away. Black cherries intermingled with the stench of incinerated flesh and hair made me dry heave.

It took a moment for me to recover from it. My eyes watered on reflex as my stomach churned. The snow around the area had all melted, leaving a ring of wet, brown grass around the Hungry Man’s scorched bones. Black smoke rose from the remains. 

“What just happened? Are you alright?” Wes asked hurriedly. 

Between whatever the Hungry Man did and how quickly everything happened, I was disoriented as my mind struggled to keep up. I had a headache developing behind both eyes. My vision had gone strange. 

Iolo's shadow. It was different. Had he dropped his human act? When he forced me to face him, I saw that wasn't the case. While he still appeared as a man in front of me, hazel eyes scrutinizing me, I couldn't take my eyes off of his shadow. His wings and spikes were visible in that silhouette. 

“Okay, well *that's* new.” I muttered. 

The mechanic had begun to chuckle as he glanced down to see what I was so fixated on, “Well, I'll be damned.”

Now that I didn't feel like I was about to keel over, I became uncomfortably aware of his grip on my shoulder. I shrugged it off. Iolo let me, but shot me a withering glare. 

Still worried, Wes demanded, “You wanna fill me in?”

The mechanic looked annoyed at having to speak to him again, but he kept his tone neutral, “Fucker gave her the second sight. Means she can see shit she's not supposed to.”

*Jesus Christ.* Besides Iolo's shadow, everything around me looked normal. Wes’ appearance hadn't changed. Since the Grass had been incinerated, I couldn't see what was different about it. 

“So, I'm going to start seeing weird shit?” I rubbed my eyes, trying to work out the throbbing behind them. “That’s just… fantastic!”

And I know someone is going to point out, ‘Nessa, that's a good thing!’ Hypothetically, yes. It’s something  that could be helpful in my profession. However, people have also gone mad from their glimpses behind the veil. There is a cost to the Hungry Man’s gift. That, and it had just been a long day.

And unfortunately, it was about to get longer. 

The mechanic started packing up his fiddle, informing us, “Well, now that that's all taken care of, as *delightful* as this has been, it's best we part ways.”

Wait. I didn’t know if Reyna or Deirdre had a chance to find any miraculous treatments for the others plagued by Grass sickness. We had to find some way to stall him. Wes and I exchanged yet another glance. 

He held up a hand towards the mechanic, “Hold on, we still haven't found what caused the Grass in the first place.”

Closing the case with a *snap,* Iolo responded, “Well, she ain’t gonna show herself while I’m here, so y’all have to come back later.”

Not wanting to have to deal with yet another lover's quarrel (I'm not sorry, Wes), I cut in, “Who is this ‘she?’”

“You familiar with the Wood Maidens, Fiona?”

No wonder this Neighbor wouldn’t show herself. 

Wood Maidens are Neighbors normally found in Scandinavian countries, though they've been popping up around various forested areas around the U.S. and other parts of the world. They are capable of changing their appearances, often disguising themselves as exceptionally beautiful young women, often using their looks to lure young men deep into the woods. 

They’re also said to have been targeted by the Wild Hunt for some ancient slight that was committed so long ago that no one can recall what initiated this feud. 

Iolo continued, starting to wander back towards his truck, “Personally, I don’t give a flyin’ fuck about ‘em. That’s more Wodan’s faction than ours. That don’t stop ‘em from bein’ real skittish ‘round us, though.”

“Wait, what’s that feud about?” I asked quickly, hurrying after him.

He shrugged, not stopping, “Fuck if I know, fuck if I care. Some wood girl probably wouldn’t spread her legs for one of ‘em.”

That made my lip curl in disgust, “Classy.” 

In a last ditch attempt to keep him here, Wes decided to set yet another fire as he harshly called after the mechanic, “Imagine that. A Huntsman resorting to violence when a woman rejects him.”

That got the mechanic to stop walking. For a moment, he just laughed, shaking his head. I knew what that sound meant. *Not good.*

I tried to signal to Wes that this was an *awful idea,* but my gestures went unnoticed.

Iolo half turned with his usual smile, “Is that what she told ya when you got hired on?”

“No,” I snapped, the headache becoming more intense as I became more stressed. “I'm not involved with this whatsoever.”

“Just telling you what I see.” Wes argued calmly. “But mainly, what I see is yet another wild animal that's needed muzzled for a while.” 

Iolo's laughter made me shiver, “And you think *you'll* be the one to do it? You been fixin’ for a rematch for a while, haven’t you bloodsucker?”

Without hesitation, Wes threw even more fuel onto the dumpster fire, “If it weren’t for your king showing up, at best, you’d be wingless. At worst, you wouldn't be here right now.”

“Is that right?” The mechanic with a short, dark chuckle as he withdrew the violin from its case once again.

I felt a bit rough. Still do. Unsure, I asked, “Hey, uh, if you two are going to kill each other, can I leave? I need to overdose on an entire bottle of Excedrin.”

That technically wasn't a lie. But what I truly intended was to try to find Reyna and Deirdre. Figure out what was going on there. 

The mechanic side-eyed me, “Yeah, go on ahead. You're not gonna want to see this, Fiona.”

Wes handed me the keys without taking his eyes off of the mechanic. Before departing, I whispered to the mechanic to please not kill my colleague. He didn't react at all. 

When I left, there were gunshots and the sounds of fiddle behind me. 

I don't know what the outcome of that fight was yet. Reyna isn't answering her phone. Still haven't heard from Vic. 

I'm heading towards the office. Maybe one of them left a note or some sort of clue about where they could be going. I'll keep yinz [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/SO6b77lmMD).
