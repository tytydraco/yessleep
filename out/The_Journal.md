I found this weird journal washed up on the beach. I have no idea what to make of it what do you guys think?



Day 1:
	Everything I know and love is gone. When I found out Sara was pregnant it was the happiest day of my life; I was going to have a baby boy, we wanted to name him Calvin. That was stolen from us. Sara was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Without chemo she was going to die, but with chemo the baby would die. I knew I couldn’t raise Calvin on my own. It is said all people carry their own fire- Sara’s was extinguished the day we lost Calvin. I tried to do everything I could to support her. It wasn’t enough. Even if she didn’t give up on her treatment I’m not sure if she’d still be with me. I watched her wither away over a few weeks then what was left of her was gone…
	Somehow I’ve lingered. I’m not sure I have the strength to keep going. I’ve always felt some comfort in nature; especially out at sea but I don’t know what I expect to find out here. Closure? My family is gone. Maybe I just want to get lost out here? I brought my gun out here too but I don’t think I have the strength to do that either. I think that’s why I’m out here. I have a destination in mind but I really don’t care anymore. I’m so fucking pathetic.
	

Day 2:
	I hardly slept but after a bottle of whiskey I managed to get a couple of hours. I didn’t really eat, Sara  always took care of me. I always said she was a professional nag but really she kept me going. Maybe that’s why clothes aren’t fitting anymore. 


Day 3:
	I got better sleep last night; it wasn’t much better, but at least I only had a glass of whiskey. I even had something to eat this morning. The weather is starting to turn, so I might finally be kept busy.


Day 7: 
	I think I’m going crazy. I saw their faces in the clouds every single night of the storm. I saw them clearer and clearer each night. Could I be crazy? At this point I don’t really care. It was nice having some company.


Day 9:
	Nothing for the last two nights. There is nothing crueler than hope…





Day 14:
	I’ve been bad about journaling. But there’s been nothing. I’m all alone. But why would I go back now? I still feel hollow, and after losing my family I was left alone. NO MATTER WHAT I CHOOSE I WILL BE ALONE.


Day 16:
	I looked in the mirror today. I knew my clothes were getting big on me but I’ve gotten so skinny, and I’ve even had some hair fall out. I should’ve brought sleeping pills with me.


Day 25:
	It’s been over a couple of weeks since I saw their faces in that storm, and when I was fishing today I saw Sara’s face in the water where my reflection should’ve been… It’s been so long in between. Maybe I am crazy.
	
	
Day 30:
	I’ve been out here for a month. What the hell am I expecting to happen? Somehow I’m still existing. I just feel worse than when I started. Should I turn back and give real life a chance or should I just get it over with and open my safe? I don’t know I’ll take the night to think it over. If I can’t come up with anything by sunrise… fuck it I’ll just flip a coin. 


Day 31: 
	I heard a baby crying last night. Right before I was going to bed I swear I heard a baby crying. I’m at least a hundred miles from the coast. I know what I heard though. I started to turn back this morning but that crying stuck with me. Maybe it’s worth it to stay out here a little longer.


Day 32:
	I heard singing last night, at the exact same time as the crying. It sounded like Sara. She had the most beautiful voice I’ve ever heard. I loved it when she sang along to songs in the car. I almost forgot what she sounded like but I heard her singing again! I can’t leave now. How could I?



Day 33:
	The singing came again tonight! I also heard the baby crying again. I think I even got a general direction of where it was coming from. It sounded like it came from even farther out. I’m getting low on food but I don’t know what I’d do if they vanished again.

Day 40:
	Everyday since my last entry the cries and songs have been getting louder, they were faint all the way at the beginning but now they’re almost booming and it's the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard.

Day 41: 
	I think I’ve reached the epicenter. I saw the water bubbling off of my port side and I heard the singing again coming from the bubbles. Maybe five minutes later I saw the same thing on my starboard but heard the cries.

Day 43:
	I’ve been sitting in the same spot for two days now but I saw them! Sara sang to me and I saw Calvin. I knew he’d be a beautiful little boy!

Day 44:
	They’re calling me to join them. I'll be with my family again.
