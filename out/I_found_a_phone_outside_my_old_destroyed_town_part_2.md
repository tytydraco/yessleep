That last journal entry has really got me thinking. I’ve tried doing some investigating into <redacted> but every time I search it or even type it into a post it just comes out as <redacted>. I can’t even find any info on the gas explosion or anything. I asked my parents about it and they act like they don’t know what I’m talking about. Now I really am starting to question if I’m losing it! Oh well, tomorrow I am going back to <redacted> and see if I can find this dome.

Alright, I have supplies. I’m bringing a tent in case I decide to stay out there longer. I have also have some food and water. I’m going to start by going to where I found the phone and walk south. I figure that’s where James’ tunnel should be right? He said he went north so if I go south I should hit the dome!

Hmm well no dome there. I’ve walked 3 miles south of the phone and still nothing. The strangest part is I haven’t even found any remnants of the town. No houses, no stores, no bodies. Just nothing. Well it’s getting dark I’m pitching the tent and am going to sleep here for the night. I’m starting to think <redacted> was never real and I might actually be losing my mind.

I don’t know how to even explain…….. I woke up this morning and I stepped outside my tent. I knew something was wrong the moment I looked up. There were no stars, no moon, just utter darkness as James described. I almost pulled my phone out to check the time but if those messages were accurate I’d be dead before I even read the time! So I wandered. I started walking north, thinking that’s the most logical place to start. After about a mile of walking, I noticed a shadowy structure in the distance. When I got closer I recognized it as the grocery store James was talking about! I went to front door and knocked………. No answer. I knocked again but just a little bit louder……….. nothing but silence. I was nervous to open the door. Thoughts rushing through my mind. What if they had lights on? What if it’s infested? What if everyone is just dead? And just as I started pulling on the door, I heard a voice behind me say “Don’t open that fucking door”

I spun around to see who was there. I couldn’t make out his face and I opened my mouth to talk to him, he put his hand in front of my face as if to say “don’t speak” and whispered in my ear “they are listening now”

He motioned for me to follow him. We started walking east, and didn’t make a sound. He kept looking back, never at me but slightly up as if he was expecting to see something there. I’d look back and look up as well but never saw a single thing. We walked for what felt like maybe 2 hours when we finally arrived at a building. He opened the door and we walked into recording studio. Once he shut the door, he looked me dead in the eye and said “Who the fuck are you?! What were you making all that noise for?!!? Those things hunt by noise! I’m surprised you’re still alive if you’re that fucking stupid!”

I looked at him in shock. I couldn’t bring myself to say any words. He gave me some water and said “Okay, easy question……. What is your name?”

I drank my water, took a deep breath, and said “I’m Brian.”

“Brian, what are you doing here?! Where did you come from?!”

“I don’t even know what happened. I was walking around the outskirts of <redacted> and found a phone laying on the ground. I took it home, charged it up, and opened it. I was just trying to figure out whose phone it was when I found some journal entries. It described some crazy monsters that attacked light and everyone in <redacted> was either dead or trapped by some kind of dome. The last message was unclear. It made it sound like people may still be alive. I tried to get help from the military and government and police. But nobody seemed to believe me. I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t try and figure out what’s going on and possible save someone’s life. So I wandered out to where I found the phone, slept in a tent, and when I woke up I was here!”

“Oh shit……. My phone actually made it out. Man I wish I would’ve made it more clear. This place is hell. We’ve tried everything to get out and nothing. The closest we got was that day I felt sun on my hand. That God damned tunnel collapsed before I could break through with my body. After that, different creatures showed up that hunt by light AND sound. Their hearing isn’t great but it’s enough to worry about. So we moved from the grocery store to the studio. It has sound proof walls so we are safe here……… come on out everyone”

After James said that, 23 people came walking out. I can’t believe these people are still alive. I can’t believe I was talking with James! 23 people. Most were mid 30s but there were a couple younger people and one 78 year old man named Charles. Every day 4 people would go out and search for a way out. They would also search for food, medicine, water, games. I was surprised at the games but we all need entertainment I guess. James came up to me and told me one of the groups only has 3 people (simple math) so I would be joining them. He said “To stay here you have to pull your weight”

Which made sense. Day after day I watched 4 people leave and 4 people come back. Nobody had much joy on their face coming back. Everyone looked so down and disheveled. I keep thinking maybe I’m the one who will have a fresh look on things! Maybe I can be the one to find the way out and bring these people out of their misery!

Finally group 6 is called! It’s me, Charles, James, and Andy. Andy is an 18 year old kid……. He must’ve been 13 or so when this whole thing started! I wanted to ask him about his life and parents and learn all about him before we left but now’s the time!

We made it back from the savaging run. Brian didn’t make it. We made it to the wall. I wanted to show Brian the dome wall, where I dug, and what we’ve tried. He was a very ambitious and curious guy. When we got to the wall, the bugs were on us instantly. Brian was behind us a little bit and when he saw we were in trouble he made a bunch of noise. He lured those bugs away from but in doing so sacrifi Um I had to switch to voice text. The phone is slowly disappearing. I can’t push buttons. What the hell is happening. This is James Allen <redacted>. Please sav 

Shit! I thought it was all a dream! I thought I was going crazy! I woke up in the hospital. When I woke up there 2 men, dressed in scrubs, with face masks on. They asked me a bunch of questions the second I woke up: Who am I? What do I remember? Where was I going? Why was I out near <redacted>? I was exhausted and couldn’t think of any lies so I told the truth. I told them all about James, the phone, the bugs, and the dome. The doctors just stared at me in mild disbelief and told me “You were lost for 2 weeks out there. We were lucky to find you! You inhaled a lot of that gas from the <redacted> explosion. That stuff is nasty. It makes you hallucinate. You’re lucky to be alive!”

I started doubting everything that happened………… until I read that last message. James wrote that last message on my phone! When I saw that message I popped up to show the doctors, but when I got to the door I overheard them talking in the hallway. The first doctor kept saying “there are people still alive! How? Everyone should be dead! And now it’s starting to suck people in? We need to do damage control. Get 100 soldiers and get a barricade around it. We don’t need more people getting involved.”

They know it’s real! Am I part of the cover up now? I’m nervous they are going to kill me to keep me quiet. I’ll keep you all updated, assuming I’m still alive!
