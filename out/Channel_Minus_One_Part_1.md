The television sat amongst the rest of whoever’s belongings, untouched and wholly uninteresting to the few visitors of the estate sale. I’d come in late, so most of the goods had already been taken by the resellers and shop curators that swarmed the recently deceased like vultures in vintage leather jackets. Besides the TV, all that was left were personal effects of no real monetary value; framed degree certificates and family pictures; old cords and batteries; thick textbooks that were worth less than the gas it would take to haul them out.



I just needed a new TV. I guess I got lucky.



For five dollars, I thought it a steal. With no discernible branding, an outdated LCD screen, and a bulky behind, I’m guessing it would be difficult to sell for much more. Even then, if it hadn’t come with the remote, I’d have left it there.



I think about that a lot. 



Setting it down on the low cabinet I used as a TV stand, I thought it fit the space better–although it was technically worse than my old TV. Gave the feng shui of the room a much needed boost. I was sure Shannon would like it a lot better as well once she came home from work. With not much money to go around, we’d moved in together to save on rent, and the decor was still a work-in-progress as a mutual and slow effort. 



After giving everything a quick wipedown, I sat down on the couch and pressed the on-button on the remote. A few flickers like static mixed with vertical blocks of colours flashed, giving me a sudden jolt of regret, thinking that I’d hauled a broken TV all this way, until the screen settled on the blank screen of channel five. 



*The last channel the previous owner ever watched*. 



But it worked, so I relaxed back into the couch, and tried not to think about it too much.



I navigated to the settings and did the initial setup, and *voila*, the channels started working. The sound was good for what it was and the picture wasn’t bad either. The TV still had the previous owner’s favorite channels set up, which felt weird to keep, so I went ahead to change them. 



Among the ten or so regular sports and entertainment channels, something stuck out: an otherwise blank name bound to channel minus one. 



Thinking that it was a bug, or perhaps some weird settings page that made sense fifteen years ago when the TV was made, I clicked on it to check it out before changing it. 



At first I thought it might be one of those static channels that only had scheduled programming. But even then it would’ve been an odd choice for what I actually saw on-screen.



In the forefront was a metallic, narrow table with a matching, uncomfortable looking chair sitting behind it. In the background were crudely stacked electronics that almost seemed like props from a cold war movie that took place entirely inside a communications bunker. A static hiss like the room trying to breathe came through. Taking a closer look, the quality and the wide angle made it seem like the feed from a surveillance camera.



I didn’t look away for more than a second. *Less* than a second. But when I turned my eyes back to the screen, a man was sitting on that chair, wearing a worn pinstripe suit and a porkpie hat. 



Maybe it was the camera’s fault, but there was something off about the man. To describe his face was like trying to find shapes in a Pollock painting; lines and muscles and tendons mixed in a way that made the ensemble of his facial features difficult to describe. All I can say with certainty is this: he wasn’t young, nor was he old, and his body seemed slightly longer than it should be, as if stretched like molten candy, and his head seemed larger than seemed natural, like one of those babies whose mother had drunk while pregnant, except with the body of an adult.



I kept waiting for him to do something, and it unnerved me that he seemed to be doing the exact same to me. His eyes bore into the camera like the gaze of a predator upon prey. Ready to strike. 



“Hello there!” the man exclaimed a moment later with a practiced joviality. “Welcome to the Negative Channel Network.”



At least the show–whatever it was–was about to start. 



Except that it didn’t. The man simply sat, his shoulders relaxed. Still looking at me.



The man cocked his head ever so slightly. “Well, aren’t you going to introduce yourself, Christian?” the man said. 



My body stiffened. The man was speaking to me. Directly. Then it relaxed, sure that it was a coincidence.



I mumbled something incoherent before the man cut me off.



“It’s alright. You’re perfectly safe, and there’s nothing wrong with your television set. Well, that’s not *entirely* true, but I am still most grateful that you’ve found it. Now, let’s get down to business, shall we?”



The man either took off his hat or put it back on. I couldn’t think of what to do or say, but the man’s demeanor seemed so natural that I noticed my body responding as if I was suddenly in a conversation, which was technically true.



“So, Christian. Thirty…one years old, I’d like to say. Living in Arizona, it seems? How wonderful. I hear it’s lovely this time of year. I’d like to see it once again.”



“What the fuck?” I said to the man, or perhaps myself, still not quite believing what was happening. It was almost funny how I felt bad for the words–that I should’ve been more polite–but the shock of it all just made the words come out.



Something dark like smoke flew over the man’s face. Or through it.



“Now, now. Let’s not get too crass. Not yet, at least. I’m sorry if I’ve frightened you, Chris. Can I call you Chris?”



“Chris is just fi–wait. Who are you? Is this a prank? Is this even a real television?”



A cold draft went through the room. Maybe it was the musky smell, but somehow it felt like the air of the room on the other side of the screen. *Like it’d come through*. 



“Chris, then” the man said, nodding once. “Who I am has been of no concern to me for a long time, and so I don’t see why I would refer any others to worry about that either. And no, this is not a prank. Do you like pranks? I can arrange one, if you’d like. And yes, it is a real television, albeit it’s not quite your standard issue one that you can get at any old department store.”



“How do you mean?” I asked. 



Something like a smile crept along the rim of his jaw.



“Well, Chris, I’m glad you asked. Now, I’m not to undermine you, but I’ll reiterate the facts before your eyes. There you are, watching your television. And here I am, on the screen. Yet, neither of us are exactly what we should be. Me, speaking directly to you. *Knowing you*. And you, speaking directly back to me. Now, what would you call that?”



“Uhm, a–is it like a communications device or something?”



“A-ha!” he exclaimed, slamming his fist on the metal table like a gavel. “You are most correct, Chris! Now, while factual, I do disagree with your interpretation. You see a communications device, and that is true. What I see is… a conversation. For there is no conversation without communication, you see? Delightful, nonetheless! Absolutely delightful!”



Everything about the man felt wrong. While he spoke, his face moved but I couldn’t quite place the rhythms of his words to it, like watching a dubbed movie. His face was like a mask of murky water, bubbling beneath with something that needed to be concealed. 



The glance I took at the remote control couldn’t have been more than a slight twitch in my eye, but immediately the room the man sat in seemed to get brighter, as if the screen snapped its fingers at me to redirect my attention. 



“Wouldn’t want to go before we’ve done our business, would you?”



“What business do we have?” I said, returning my attention back to the man.



The room behind the screen returned back to its previous, boring glow. “I’m glad you asked. There’s something I’d like you to see.”



The way he said it felt ominous, catching my breath and putting it on pause. 



“I’d like you to turn to channel Minus Forty-One, if you could.”



The air felt still, as if the buzzing, breathing room behind the screen was clawing its way out into my living room. With my heart making its way up my throat, I took another glance at the remote. 



It wasn’t where I’d put it. I could’ve sworn it was there, since I always kept it at the same spot. Right there on the arm of the couch…



“Chris?” the man on the screen said as I jumped up and started looking around the room. First where I’d sat, then between and under the couch cushions, the floor…



“Chris, my boy?” the man said, louder and more firm this time. “You’re not thinking of turning the television off, are you?”



I didn’t want to answer him. If I could just find the remote, then…



The doorbell rang, and for some reason, as if to ask if it was him–or for his permission–I turned to look at the screen. Shrugging, the man said “Why don’t you answer it?”



I wasn’t expecting anyone, but going to the door would give me a moment to breathe. The doorbell rang again, twice in quick succession, and I strode to the door.



On the porch stood a delivery man, except that he wasn’t holding a package. Something about his body seemed off, like the sunlight was trickling through it. A sudden headache hit me as the man said “Christopher?” 



“Yes,” I said, nodding once politely. 



The delivery man smiled widely, his teeth crooked and sharp and stained with charcoal black. Once his smile had widened to capacity, something in his face still moved, as if the muscles were fighting to stretch his lips farther and farther apart. 



With a quiet, wet sound, like cutting fruit, another tooth sliced through the skin just under his right cheekbone. Then another, and another, his face stretching further back as blackened teeth began to pop through his cheeks and around his jaw, forming a second, crude set of teeth, arranged like a poorly made bouquet. Blood trickled down from the fresh wounds, slowly staining his uniform. 



When he spoke again, his voice was different: lower in register, gurgling the blood running down his throat. 



“Channel Minus Forty-One.”



My hand was still clutching the doorknob, yet I was frozen in shock and indecision. I tried to speak, my mind running through the lookbook of previous experiences and general knowledge as it tried to figure out what the right protocol for a situation like this was.



There wasn’t one, and so the simple and atavistic act of flight took over as I slammed the door shut, locked it and took a few steps back, waiting for what was about to come next. Waiting for the man to come through the door. To do me some harm I couldn’t imagine.



Something like a wet crackle emanated from behind the door, slow and deliberate. 



And one by one, the man opened the mail slot with bloodied fingers, and dropped blackened teeth through it. I could only watch as my mind struggled finding an escape route, until it noticed something odd about the teeth. 



They weren’t simply scattered around. They were forming into a shape, like magnets to a metal sheet. It was obvious what the teeth formed before the last ones dropped. 



***-41***



“Chris? You alright there?” the TV sounded from the living room, giving rise to an anger within me that rivaled the shock and fear roiling in my shaking hands.



“What the fuck is going on?” I asked the man as I made my way to face him.



“Nothing but a good prank, I presume,” he said.



“How are you doing this? What are you? I swear I’ll turn that fucking TV off. I’ll take a bat to it and smash it to pieces, cutting the wires with a fucking machete and finally taking the whole thing to get crushed in one of those car crushers at the lot.”



The anger felt good. Righteous. I could barely feel the fear anymore, and it only served to fuel my wrath. 



It all faded away as the man spoke. The screen turned bright as a star, enveloping him in the white light.



The man sighed, and then took in a quick breath before he spoke.



“If you don’t do as I say, *I will hunt you down*. I will make each and every single day, each hour, minute and second worse than the last. I will make you turn mad, and let that madness run its course until there’s nothing left of you except fear. And you will become a shriveled thing, shrouded in darkness, until you’re too scared to even open your eyes.”



The screen faded back to its previous, calm glow, bringing the man back into view. He seemed calm.



“Now, if I were you, I’d turn to channel Minus Forty-One. Then we’ll talk.”



“I… I don’t have the remote.”



“Isn’t it exactly where it always is?”



Turning my eyes to the arm of the couch, the remote sat in its place, undisturbed. I grabbed it quickly, as if it might vanish at any moment, or perhaps just to see if it was real. 



“There you go, my boy. Delightful. Just type in 41, then press both the up and down volume buttons at the same time.”



My hands were still shaking as I input the channel, moving my fingers over the volume buttons but not yet pressing them down. Nothing good could come of it, that much I knew. There had to be some way out, something my muddled mind couldn’t come up with. Each second felt longer than the last as the TV began to glow brighter again. Fear crept up my neck like a chokehold, burning my skin as my shirt stuck to the small of my back with sweat.



Nothing came to mind, and as if the man noticed–or perhaps got tired of waiting–he lunged at the screen. Struggling to display a closeup view of the man, the screen turned into a grotesque, indecipherable plume of smoke made of darkness, light, and dark *flesh*. The speakers crackled and hissed like a thousand dying light bulbs.



From a dark point on the screen emerged a finger the color of gray static, fighting through the veil like a hammer coming down on a non-newtonian fluid. My hand still clutched the remote, a searing pain working its way through it, pulled and attracted towards the screen, fighting to stay put.



The man’s finger grew as it emerged, followed by the wrist, and then the forearm. The elbow came out later than I expected, and the shoulder didn’t reveal itself before the hand had reached the remote, carefully straining its dead-cold fingers around mine like the tendrils of an octopus. The weight of the remote shifted as he pressed down, burning my skin like ice, then immediately released as the arm was pulled back into the screen in quick succession, like a frog’s tongue.



My hand felt cold and sore, but the man was swallowed up by the screen, giving me a moment’s rest as I waited for what was next. Because there’s always a *next*. 



The TV flickered, and another camera feed came into view.



The room was padded on all sides, with white peeking through the dusty gray of wear. In the middle, a woman sobbed, her forehead resting against her knees, arms bound around her body like a pair of socks twisted within each other. 



“Who is that,” I whispered to myself.



But even before she looked up, I knew.



Shannon lifted her head up and said “Chris, is that [you](https://wintersnoah.wordpress.com)?”
