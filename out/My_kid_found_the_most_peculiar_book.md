Hi everyone. I have a story I'd like to share with you.

Lately, I’ve been getting into thrifting. Marketplace, Craigslist, eBay, and of course, local thrift stores. I’m not looking for anything in particular. It’s more of a treasure hunt. What fascinates me is how each item feels like a fragment of someone else’s life story. Like a snippet frozen in time, from when each object served a different purpose. Sometimes I find collectibles that I flip for a quick buck. You start to develop an eye for what might be valuable and what’s destined to end up in a recycling plant.

A few weeks ago, I took my toddler downtown. I’d seen an ad on Facebook about a pop-up store that had opened, but work and the other things we collectively call “life” kept postponing my visit. To my disappointment, most of the good stuff had already been picked over by other customers. If there’s one thing I’ve learned quickly, it’s that when it comes to thrifting, be early. This pop-up had been open for an entire week and was about to close, so what remained was more or less junk. You know the kind of stuff nobody wants. Old paintings by unknown artists, glassware that someone’s now-dead relatives once owned. Books, broken toys, and of course, heaps and heaps of clothes that clearly only appealed to one person, their previous owner.

My kid ran into the maze of shelves and clothes racks as soon as we arrived. I followed, doing my best to scan for anything interesting that other thrifters might’ve missed. Funny how all thrift stores seem to smell the same. I passed the counter and gave a quick nod to the teen behind the register, who was wearing headphones. She didn’t look up from her phone. I know a lot of people complain about teenagers and their screens these days, but come on. Haven’t teenagers always been criticized by older generations? And really, what would I do if I were stuck behind the register of an empty thrift store on a Saturday afternoon? I’d be watching something on a screen too.

A box of vinyl records caught my attention, so I stopped for a few minutes. I could hear my son’s footsteps across the room as he made his way to the kids’ section. Every thrift store seems to have one, an area for broken toys, board games with missing pieces, and picture books nobody wants. I flipped through the records, but as expected, the good ones were long gone. The rule about being early is especially true when it comes to vinyl. Record collectors can be a vicious breed. Thankfully, I’m not one of them, but I’ve seen them. Groups of middle-aged guys standing outside before a store opens, arms crossed and faces stern, like they’re not even enjoying themselves. What’s the point, then? I wonder.

I gave up on the records and made my way toward the toys. I could see my son sitting on the floor, legs folded under him. As I rounded the corner, I saw he was looking into a book, but he slammed it shut as I approached. He turned to me, hugged the book tightly, and asked me to buy it for him. We left the store a few minutes later, the book added to our small home library of children’s stories.

Before tossing it into my backpack, I gave it a quick glance, and one thing caught my attention right away. The book didn’t have an author printed on the cover. Flipping it over, I noticed it also lacked a barcode. Odd, if you ask me, but I let it slide as we walked home and got caught up in other things.

When we got home, my kid opened the backpack and grabbed the book the moment we stepped inside. He rushed to his room and slammed the door behind him. That’s when things started to get a little strange at first, and now, borderline unsettling.

He’s been spending all his free time in his room with that book. It’s been a few days since we brought it home, and he seems more and more invested in whatever the book is about. Sure, he still goes to school, helps out with chores, and everything else, but the second he gets a moment of free time, it’s straight to his room, door shut.

What’s giving me this uneasy feeling is that, starting yesterday, he’s begun laughing and talking to himself in there. And let me underline, this is a kid who’s never had imaginary friends or anything like that. I asked him what was so funny during dinner, and he just replied, “Something I read,” and left it at that.

It’s just such an adult thing to say. Something I read. Do kids even talk like that?

Last night, I was woken by a sound. At first, I thought I was dreaming, but then I heard muffled voices through the wall that separates my bedroom from my son’s. For a few seconds, it sounded like a group of people were talking, then silence. Until I heard my son’s voice say, “Good night.” Silence again.

I got up and rushed to his room, pushing the door open. He was lying in bed, fast asleep. The book was closed next to him. I know some of you might think I was still dreaming, but I wasn’t. I was fully awake. I remember everything clearly. I’m dreading tonight. This is getting out of hand. I don’t believe in ghosts, and part of me fears that maybe my son is making all those voices himself. But then again, he was sound asleep when I checked in.

Please help me. What should I do?
