They say if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life.
I don’t love what I do.
Not exactly.

But I was born for it.
And I’m very, very good at it.

It’s not a 9-to-5.
There’s no clocking in, no coffee breaks, no PTO.
You don’t apply for this kind of job.
It finds you.

And the first thing they tell you — the very first thing — is:
Never tell anyone what you do.
Not your spouse. Not your family. Not your priest.

Not even yourself, if you can help it.

But lately, it’s been getting harder to ignore.
The weight of it. The screams of it.

So here I am.
Telling you.

⸻

I guess the easiest way to explain it is this:

I clean up… after things.
Unnatural things.

You know when a family just disappears from their home?
Car still in the driveway.
Dinner half-eaten.
No signs of struggle. Just… gone?

That’s when I get a call.

Or when some hikers go off-trail and are found days later — faces stretched in terror, skin blistered like it aged 100 years overnight?

That’s me, too.

But I’m not law enforcement.
Not military.
Not some paranormal investigator with a podcast and a night-vision camera.

I don’t ask questions.
I don’t take notes.
I remove.

Blood. Evidence. Sometimes entire houses.

And I do it well.

⸻

My tools are custom.
They don’t have names — just serial codes.
I’ve got solvents that melt bone, vacuums that erase the residue of fear, gloves that never stain.

And then there’s the Black Book.
It’s always waiting on my kitchen table in the morning.

No knock. No call. Just there.
Heavy. Smells like dirt and ozone.

Inside is always the same:
A name.
A location.
And a set of rules.

Follow the rules.
That’s what keeps you alive.

⸻

Let me give you an example.
A few months ago, I was sent to a house in Oregon.

A cabin. Deep woods.
No roads on Google Maps.

The Black Book said:

RULE 1: Do not look in the mirrors.
RULE 2: Remove the nursery wallpaper before dusk.
RULE 3: If you hear crying from under the floorboards, leave.
Immediately.

I followed them.
Mostly.

I slipped.
Glanced at a mirror by the front door — just for a second.

Saw something that wasn’t me.
It had my face, but the smile wasn’t mine. The teeth weren’t human.

I covered it with a blanket and kept working.
Didn’t sleep for three days after that.

But I got the job done.
Place was gone by morning.
Just dirt and fog where the cabin used to be.

⸻

Sometimes it’s worse.
Sometimes they send me to places where the walls breathe.

Where clocks run backward.
Where the wind whispers in dead languages.

Last year, there was a site — I can’t say where — that required me to burn down a hotel that didn’t technically exist.

The Black Book said:

“Each room you enter will add another memory you never had. Burn it before you forget who you are.”

Took me five hours.
By the time I lit the final match, I was almost convinced I had a wife named Clara and a baby girl named June.
I don’t.

I double-checked.

I think.

⸻

The worst job I ever had?

A basement in Kansas.
Concrete walls. Chains.
Blood thick as syrup on the floor.

Nothing in the Black Book but one sentence:

“It is still hungry. Do not feed it anything you love.”

I almost failed that one.
Dropped my wallet without noticing.
Had a photo of my sister in it.

I left the house shaking.
When I checked my wallet in the car, the photo was gone.
In its place was a scrap of flesh.

Still beating.

⸻

Some days I wonder who they are — the ones who leave the book.
The ones who know where the horrors are.
The ones who created the rules.

Are they protecting us?
Or just covering their tracks?

Am I the good guy in all this?
Or just another cog in a much darker machine?

I try not to ask.
The Black Book doesn’t like it when you ask.
I tried once — left a note inside:

“Who are you?”

Next morning, I woke up with my own handwriting carved into my arm.

“Cleaner, clean thyself.”

I bled for hours.

⸻

So why am I telling you this now?

Because this morning, for the first time in over a decade…
The Black Book didn’t show up.

Instead, there was an envelope.

My name written in red.
No return address.
Inside — a photo.

Of me.
Sleeping.

And on the back, just one rule:

“Do not run. We already know where you’ll go.”

⸻

I have a very special job.
But I think I just became the next mess to clean up.

And I don’t think anyone’s coming to save me.
