**Hey everyone, my name is Henry and I’ve been searching for a roommate for about three months now. Only one real person has actually called me, but a lot of strange things have been going on before that. I can’t sleep or focus and I need help in trying to find a rational explanation for all this. If you know anything or have had something similar happen to you, please let me know. I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this if nothing changes.**

I’m currently in my junior year of college and am preparing to go into my senior year. I’ve never really been one for a huge friend group and I think a lot of people would consider me a social recluse. I did the two years of on-campus housing that my college required of me, but it was never easy for me. Not because I had horrible roommates or anything like that—they were actually surprisingly clean and good people—I just prefer to live alone and have my own space. Luckily when I was going into my third year, I was able to score a pretty low rent single bed apartment a couple of miles away from my college. It wasn’t the best apartment in the world—the walls were thin, and it never smelled right, but it was mine. I never had this kind of freedom growing up, so living alone was partly a rebellion against my upbringing.

About 4 months ago, the rent prices here in San Diego started to go up, and I won’t be able to continue renting this apartment for long with my current income. My lease was up in 3 months, so I had until then to find a new apartment. As much as I want to find another single apartment, I had no choice but to split it with a roommate because of the prices. Fortunately, I was able to find an apartment that is still cheap enough to where I’ll be able to split it with someone and still have some money left over, assuming I was able to find someone.

I got in contact with my old roommates and friends, but none of them wanted to or were able to move in with me. I didn’t hold this against any of them as it’s our third year of college and most friend groups have solidified by now, and everyone is already either locked into a lease or already has a planned group of people to live with. Again, I didn’t have a lot of friends in the first place, so I’d have to find a random roommate. 

I wasn’t too upset by this idea as my roommates in freshman year were also randomized, granted they were randomized through the school so I was roomed alongside people the same age as me, and were enrolled in the college. The downside of trying to find a roommate now is that I have no agency like that so technically anyone who sees my ad could respond. I ended up printing and posting these signs up around my college area that read: 

**ROOMMATE WANTED**

**SINGLE ROOM IN**

**2BD 1BA APARTMENT**

**207-597-4793**

My hope was that another college student would see this sign, give me a call, and we could go from there. I didn’t post it online because I’ve read way too many horror stories about people posting roommate ads online and getting bombarded with weirdos and creeps trying to move in. This way, I could at least try to limit the groups of people who would see my sign.

About a week after putting these signs up, I received my first phone call. It occurred to me then that I hadn’t even put my name on the sign, so from the perspective of any caller, they were essentially calling a stranger as well. As my cell rang, I looked at the caller ID and saw a random number I didn’t recognize. 

 “Hello, who's this?...” I said, and waited for a few seconds for a reply but all I could hear on the other end was static. 

“Hello? Is anyone there? Are you calling about the roommate ad?” I asked again. There was still only static coming from the other end of the receiver as I briefly brought the phone down from my ear to look at the number, and then back up again. It didn’t have the *Scam Likely* line under the number like most of the random calls I got in the past, so it must’ve been a real number.

“Hel-” I started to say before being cut off by the click of the phone as whoever was on the other end of the line hung up. I checked the number for a third time to see if I recognized it, but I didn’t. I tried calling the number back but all I was met with was the ringing of a phone that would never be picked up. In the end I just attributed it to being a wrong number and put it out of my mind. 

I didn’t receive another call until four days later from another number that I didn’t recognize. I figured this time I should introduce myself and confirm the reason that the person was calling.

“Hello, this is Henry, are you calling about the roommate ad?” I said, and waited a few seconds but didn’t hear anything but the crackle and static of the phone line. 

“Hello? Are you there? Can you hear me?” I asked inquisitively. I thought maybe that something was wrong with my phone and perhaps they couldn’t hear me and that’s why they didn’t reply, or maybe I couldn’t hear them. 

“This isn’t funny, can you say something if you can hear me?” I said while I waited for a response. Frustratedly, I took initiative and hung up the phone. Maybe a group of college kids saw my ad and decided to prank me. Our college was a pretty big frat school, so I wouldn’t be surprised if this was the case. I was honestly getting more annoyed than anything at this point. I tried calling back again but was met with the same result as before. The worst part about it is that there was nothing I could do about it. I had to pick up every call in case it was someone trying to get ahold of me for the roommate ad which left me in a constant state of dread.

I didn’t have to wait long as the next call came at about 8am the next day. The ringing of my phone woke me up and I remember fumbling around trying to answer it in time. Groggy from sleep, I answered with my usual phrase, “Hi…hello, you’ve reached Henry, are you calling about the um…the roommate ad?” 

While what I heard wasn’t a voice, it was something different than the usual static on the other end of the line. It was subtle and I didn’t hear it at first but I’m positive it was the sound of breathing. It didn’t sound normal, like you know when you’re on the phone and all the noise coming through sounds very mechanical and prickly because of the static. This had none of that. As quiet as it was, I could hear it perfectly, almost like someone was actually breathing into my ear. 

“Hello!? Who’s this?...It-it’s really early for you to be calling,” I said, blood beginning to rise in my face. No response came and the breathing just continued whispering in my ear. I could almost feel the breath coming through the phone.

“This really isn’t funny anymore, can-can you just say something or stop calling me?” I asked again as panic started to rise in my voice. I still didn’t get a response—the breathing just continued. 

“If-if you don’t say something, I’m going to hang up!” I threatened, hoping to get at least some sort of response. But I didn’t, so I hung up. I didn’t try calling back this time.

By this point I was fully awake. Whatever grogginess I had while answering the call, quickly disappeared into dread once I had started to hear the breathing on the other end of the line. There was no reasonable explanation I could tell myself why it was so clean. I’ve been on the phone plenty of times and it’s always been that unmistakable staticy kind of translation of sound waves being transferred miles over wires and radiowaves. I realized after hanging up that I didn’t even check the number of the caller, so I went into my call history to find it. I saw the previous two phone calls right next to it as these were the only calls I had received this week. But just like the others, it was a new number.

Later the same day I decided to go walk around my college and make an amendment to all of my signs. I didn’t like being pranked like this and although this probably wouldn’t change anything, it would at least put my mind at ease for a little bit. After a few hours, I managed to write another line to all of my signs, and it now read as:

**ROOMMATE WANTED**

**SINGLE ROOM IN**

**2BD 1BA APARTMENT**

**207-597-4793**

Serious Inquiries Only

I didn’t receive another call for 3 weeks. The time spent between was a mix of wondering about the three phone calls I had gotten, and anxiety about not receiving any calls about my ad. I thought that maybe whoever was on the other end of the line had gotten bored with pranking me and they finally moved on or maybe my addition to the signs knocked some sense into them, but I realize now that that couldn’t be farther from the truth. 

The next call I received was as I was walking home from work at around 10pm—I didn’t own a car so I had to either walk everywhere or take public transport. Usually I take the bus to and from work, but it didn’t show up on time so I was forced to walk. My house wasn’t far, only a few miles and luckily it was all flat.

“Hello? This is Henry,” I said while answering the phone, forgetting to include asking if they were calling about the ad. It was late and my mind was occupied elsewhere.

“Hello?...” I said again with a boring indignation as all of the mystery calls and empty lines came flooding back to me. This time was different—for the first time, someone, or something, finally responded.

“...Hello?” said the voice on the other end of the line. The edge to my voice instantly disappeared and a wave of relief washed over me as I was finally greeted by another voice. I stopped walking and let my shoulders sag with relief as I responded.

“Yes! Hi! Hello! This is Henry, are you calling about the roommate ad?” I asked eagerly with a new sense of excitement as I thought someone was finally going to actually ask about the ad. I waited patiently for the voice to respond.

“...Hello?” the voice said back to me.

“Yea, can you hear me hello?” I asked once again. Maybe they didn’t hear me the first time. “Are you there?”

“...ou there hello?” the voice said back to me.

“Yes I’m here, who is this? Are you-uh calling about the ad?” I was beginning to get slightly frustrated as this back and forth continued. I waited for them to respond but the only sound I could hear through the phone was static. After what felt like a lifetime, I spoke again.

“Hey, can you hear me?” I started walking again while I waited. The response never came and I hung up angrily. I walked the rest of the way home thinking about the phone call and getting upset at whoever was on the other end of the line. I was upset but maybe they just couldn’t hear me very well, afterall they seemed to be replying and this was the first caller to actually have said something. There was something off about the voice though. Just like the breathing weeks before, there was something about it that felt wrong, but I couldn’t yet name what it was. If it was someone pranking me, there had to be at least four of them, as every single number was different.

The next call came six days later at midday. Almost like a routine at this point, I picked up my phone, answered the call, and said “You’ve reached Henry, are you calling about the roommate ad-”

“...Calling about the roommate ad?” the voice said back to me almost immediately. 

This took me by surprise and I remember having a visceral reaction as I jumped out of my seat a little as the sudden response was so different from what I was used to. It took me a few seconds to even realize what the voice had said, and that it was just saying what I had said, minus a few words.

“Who is this?” I asked into my phone. I waited a few seconds, eagerly listening for any kind of noise on the other end. The voice didn’t reply as fast this time, it took about 10 seconds before it spoke again.

“...Are you calling about the roommate ad?” the voice said. Although there was no mocking tone to the voice, I still felt like I was somehow being mocked.

“What do you mean am I calling about the roommate ad? Who is this?! Why do you keep calling me and stop playing around!” What I said came out a lot more aggressive than I think I meant it to be. I was becoming more and more irritated at whatever was happening.

“...Stop playing around! Are you calli-” 

“I’m hanging up. Don’t ever call me again,” I said angrily, hanging up the phone as I threw it towards the bed. I covered my face and tried to massage the tension out of my face.

This was getting ridiculous. Whoever was pranking me on the other end of the line was simply repeating everything I was saying. It felt incredibly juvenile, you know how you would mock your friends by just repeating what they were saying. I remember a lot of my bullies in elementary school would do this exact same thing. It was a lame and lazy way to bully someone, but it was effective in drowning out someone's voice. Looking back, I thought that might have partly been the cause as to why I didn’t like talking to people much. Maybe I was always afraid that they would just mock and make fun of me. My parents certainly didn’t help with that.

Over the next few weeks, the phone calls started to intensify. Unlike before, these calls were starting to come later at night, and even through the morning. My sleeping schedule started to get worse as these calls were continuously waking me up. Even if I put my phone on silent, my phone would still ring and vibrate. I thought that maybe my phone really was broken, but even if it was, I didn’t have the money to get it repaired. Each call I picked up I was still met with the same sort of mimicry and repetition, but as soon as I realized this, I would hang up immediately. 

I had started to text some of my friends about what was happening and they all gave me more or less the same response: they told me to just stop accepting phone calls if I was getting this upset about it, or block them. I don’t think they fully understood that it was a new number each time, and therefore impossible to block beforehand. Any other person might have stopped answering altogether, but I desperately needed to find a roommate as I only had about a month left until my lease was up. 

From when I’m writing this post, I didn’t receive another call until about two weeks ago. This marked the 13th call I had received from a different number.

“*Hello..*” I said annoyed into the phone immediately after picking it up. I was done trying to act nice or entertain the thought that it was someone actually calling about the ad. Every new number I now associated with the thought of it being the same as before.

“Hello? Are you there? Say something if you can hear me,” the voice said.

My eyes widened and my entire body froze in shock as the voice spoke to me. Every call I had received where it spoke back to me sounded like a real phone call. I could hear the static of the line and the warped sound of a voice on a phone. But this time, it was that clear, almost present voice of someone physically talking into my ear. Just like the breathing I had heard months before.

“Hello? Can you hear me?” it said again. “Are you calling about the roommate ad? Hang up!”

I didn’t dare reply. It’s like the shock had locked me out of my body, all I could do was try to find my composure and listen.

“Hello? Hello? Hey? Who is this? This really isn’t funny anymore!” the voice continued to whisper and mock into my ear. After what seemed like a lifetime, I finally mustered up the courage to respond.

“What…what do you want?...” I whispered out.

“What do you want?” it whispered back to me.

“I-I want you to stop calling me!” I answered angrily, not even realizing I was technically responding to my own question.

“I want you to stop calling me!” It said back almost immediately.

“Stop fucking repeating me!” I screamed into the phone.

“Stop fucking repeating me!” it screamed back. This was the first time the voice had yelled, but only because I had yelled. The sheer force and surprise of it caused me to freeze, just waiting for it to say something else. All I could hear was static from the phone, despite the fact that the voice had none of that static. I calmed down and prepared to speak again.

“Hello?” we both said at the same time.

I realized in that moment why the voice was wrong and why it bothered me so much. It was my voice. I could never nail it before because we spoke at different times, but after hearing it speak with me, and hearing absolutely no difference between mine and its. I knew that it was, and had been, talking to me with my own voice the entire time.

I hung up the phone and blocked the number immediately. As my panic and anxiety rose, I went through every call I had received and blocked each individual number. I didn’t know what this would solve because it was a new number each time, but this gave me at least some sort of control over a situation where I was desperately lacking it.

After that, the time of day didn’t matter to it anymore. The calls came frequently and unrelentingly through the day and night for the next two weeks. I never picked them up, but it didn’t matter. I could barely sleep and my paranoia about the situation increased with each call. Even when I did manage to sleep, the ringing would work its way into my dreams, and cause me to wake up hyperventilating and my sheets soaked with sweat. Sometimes a noise in a TV show, or the beeping of a machine at work would trigger these thoughts and I would instantly be overwhelmed with dread. When my phone did ring, I often just stared at it, waiting, and willing it to stop ringing. I was afraid that whoever—or whatever it was, had finally gotten what it wanted, and I was scared of what it might say if I answered just one more time. 

I decided I would go back around my college area and take my ads down. I didn’t care what happened next with my apartment or if taking down the signs would help, I just wanted the calls to stop. I would even move back across the country to live with my parents again if I had too. As much as I also dreaded that idea. 

By the morning of when I wrote this post, there were a total of 111 missed calls from 111 different numbers. I didn’t know if this would ever stop, but I knew that I shouldn’t answer it again. Unfortunately, I did answer one more time, but not on purpose.

I had just gotten home after collecting all my signs from the college area. As much as the ringing had almost become like a part of me, I didn’t hear or feel my phone vibrating, all I heard was the muffle of a voice under me as I was sitting on my bed watching TV. I took my phone out of my pocket and saw that someone had called, and that I had answered it somehow, whether it was a butt-dial answer or what I didn’t know. But I could hear someone talking on the other end. Cautiously and afraid of what I might hear, I slowly put the phone up to my ear and listened.

“...llo? Hello? Anyone there? My names John, I’m calling about the roommate ad?”
