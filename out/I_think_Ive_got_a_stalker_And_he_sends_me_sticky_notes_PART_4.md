**PART 4:**

Those of you who have been following my posts know that I’ve been getting sticky notes from a stalker, so you already know what to expect when I post. This time though, I need you to expect the unexpected…

I received another sticky note (a purple one again) and it came with another strange marking on one of the corners…

***“You’re running out of time, little mouse...”***

One of the comments on my last post mentioned that it may be a puzzle, and that maybe I should connect the sticky notes to see if it makes a picture? Since receiving this new sticky note, I think they might just be right… I also need to address the note I got from my neighbor across the hall from me, but I’ll get to that in a few paragraphs. Just bear with me and be patient... You'll understand why I saved that whole interaction for the ending of my post.

So, I finally took some time out to meet some of the other tenants on my floor. I’ll document what I thought about each of them individually, and maybe some of you can help me figure out if any of them might be a suspect? Someone in my last post mentioned my landlord (Jack), but for some reason I just can’t fathom him doing anything sinister? But then again… I really don’t know who I can trust, can I?

**YESTERDAY, 4:30 PM**

*Mrs. Kirtley & Derek \_\_\_\_\_\_\_?*

“Can I help you with something?”

“Hi! I’m the new tenant that just moved into 13B, I just wanted to introduce myself!” Handing the woman the neatly wrapped box of cookies, I smiled and said, “I’m Anna, nice to meet you.” I figured if I was going to meet (interrogate) my neighbors, the best course of action would be to sweeten them up first.

Yanking the cookies from my grasp, the woman threw them on the ground and looked me right in the eye before saying, “Stay away from me. I don’t want anything that’s touched you or your apartment in my space.”

With a nod, I backed away and quickly apologized before she slammed the door. Confusion bubbled within me and my eyes couldn’t help but water when I saw the box on the ground. The cookies had all toppled out, some of them broken. The twine had come loose during the tumble. Crouching down, I scooped up the pieces and the crumbs and shoved them back into the box. Embarrassment burned at my cheeks as I scrambled to do so as fast as I could. Most of them fell onto her welcome mat which looked incredibly pristine before my unwanted cookies landed on it. Maybe she just didn’t take kindly to visitors? I know I certainly didn’t feel very “welcome”. My first impression of this woman was that she wasn’t very pleasant in the slightest. I didn’t even get her name. She was a willowy looking woman with thin gray hair and unusually blue eyes. Upon first glance, she didn’t even look as if she could hurt a fly, but her words said otherwise.

Before I could stand back up though, I felt a hand on my shoulder. A gasp escaped my lips and I jerked, the touch catching me off guard. Before I knew it, my elbow connected with a face and in the same instant I heard a slight groaning sound. Dropping the cookies, I turned around to see a man. I cringed when I noticed his hand clutching his nose, blood continuing to seep out from beneath his fingertips.

“Oh my gosh! I’m so sorry!” Rushing across the hallway to my door, I hurriedly pulled it open and called out to him, “Stay right there!” Grabbing a handful of napkins, I ran back out into the hall and handed them to him, guilt clawing at my insides. If only he knew why I was so jumpy. I’d been on nothing but high alert for days… “I’m so sorry! I didn’t even hear you walking up to me.”

A small chuckle escaped his lips as he took the napkins from my hands and held them up to his nose. “You sure are a lot stronger than you look, that’s for sure. I think you broke it.”

A million more apologies danced on the tip of my tongue and I started to recite them all before he cut me off and said, “It’s alright! It wouldn’t be the first time after all.”

I looked up at him curiously and he was quick to answer me.

“First time was during a boxing match with a buddy.” His hand applied steady pressure to the area, but the napkin was quickly filling up as he continued to speak. “I didn’t mean to scare you, but I caught the tail end of your encounter with our friendliest neighbor, Mrs. Kirtley.” The sarcasm in his voice was enough to make me crack a little grin. After my incident with that woman, I could really use a kind face. Before I could respond though, he was introducing himself. “I actually live right across from Mrs. Kirtley. My name’s Derek.”

Derek was tall and slim and athletic looking. He looked like the type that probably ran track in highschool?

“Well it’s very nice to meet you, Derek. I hate that your first impression of me wasn’t exactly…” I trailed off again before I continued, embarrassed that I let my paranoia get the better of me. “I, um, just moved in right across the hall here, do you want to come in for a bit? I’ve got a first aid kit -”

“Oh I’m fine! Really!” His eyes darted in the direction of my apartment. The look on his face mirrored the same look I received from Mrs. Kirtley… Fear?

I didn’t want to be pushy, but I also felt the extreme need to atone for my actions. Looking at the ground he shuffled his feet some as I spoke. “Please? I feel horrible about your nose. I’ve already made one bad impression, and the last thing I’d want is for another one.”

Glancing up at me, he looked at his watch and then finally relented. “I guess I could come in for a bit. You did hit me pretty hard after all. Not the nicest way to greet a neighbor…” My cheeks once again burned red before I broke out into laughter. His sarcasm was much needed and my laughter only seemed to push him onward. “I mean, if you greet all your neighbors like that-”

“Only the nice ones.” I interrupt, the corners of my mouth tugged up into a cheeky grin. His face mirrored mine as he made his way into my apartment.

“You’re witty.” He responded, “I like it. We could use a little of that around here. Most of the other neighbors are pretty dry.”

“Well,” I said as I grabbed the first aid kit from my bathroom, “I’m glad that I’ve offered some much needed change around here then.”

Opening the kit, he pilfered through it till he found the gauze. Shoving some of it into his nose, he looked over at me and pointed to my freezer. “You got a bag of frozen peas or somethin’?”

“I think I actually might!” Handing him the peas, he winced a little as he held the bag to his nose.

“Thanks…? Sorry, I never caught your name?”

“Oh, it’s Anna! I was too busy trying to knock you out to introduce myself, I guess.” A small laugh slipped past my lips when he shook his head and smiled back.

“Injury aside, you seem like a nice girl, so I’ll forgive ya this time!” Once again, his words were coated in just the right amount of sarcasm. Setting down the peas, he rubbed the bridge of his nose gingerly.

“Well..” I started awkwardly, “I would have brought you some cookies too, but unfortunately those all ended up on Mrs. Kirtley’s welcome mat…”

“You mean these?” Setting on my coffee table was the crumbled box of broken cookies. I’d forgotten to even grab them after all the commotion.

“Yes, actually! Thank you for grabbing those for me.”

“Of course. I ate a piece of one while you were looking for the first aid kit, and I’ve gotta hand it to ya, you’re a pretty decent baker.”

Brushing back a strand of my hair and tucking it behind my ear, my face lit up just the tiniest bit at that remark. Having a friend would be nice… But could I trust him??

**TODAY**

The person I needed to meet the most lived right across from me and right beside Derek. He was the one that left me the note… And he was also the neighbor I was the most hesitant about meeting for that exact reason.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**YESTERDAY, 5:00 PM**

*Dr. Matt Pryor*

Knocking on his door took me at least a good 5 minutes. 3 minutes trying to figure out what I would even say and 2 minutes trying to convince myself to knock. But when I finally did, he was quick to answer.

“Hi, you were the one who left me the-”

“Come inside.”

The abrupt way in which he cut me off was slightly unnerving. I knew he’d probably been expecting me since he left that note on my doorstep, but I didn’t expect him to be so eager to see me?

The first thing I noticed when I stepped into his apartment was how insanely clean it was? It almost looked as if no one lived there at all. His apartment was very modern and everything was either in a shade of gray or black. It felt very... Sterile?

“Take a seat.” He said, instructing me to sit on one of the couches in the living room.

His strange demeanor was only proving to make me more nervous and uncomfortable, but despite his off-putting way of speaking, I knew I needed to hear him out.

“I apologize for coming across so…” He trailed off before changing the subject and holding out a hand in my direction. “Dr. Pryor, but you can just call me Matt.”

Matt looked to be of Italian descent. His hair was thick and dark and his face sported a couple of wrinkles above his forehead that led me to believe that maybe he was in his 40’s or 50’s? And he was dressed in formal attire. He donned black slacks, a white dress shirt with sleeves rolled up to his elbows and his tie was slightly loosened.

Shaking his hand, I tried to paste a smile across my face and offer my own pleasantries. “I’m Anna, nice to meet you.”

Nodding, he sat back in his chair and steepled his fingers together in thought for a few moments before he finally broke the silence. “I’m sure you’re wondering why I left that note on your doorstep. I didn’t mean for it to come across as strange, and I hope you didn’t take it that way, but I felt like I needed to warn you.”

“Warn me of what, exactly?” My own fingers fidgeted with a stray piece of string that had come loose at the bottom of my blouse.

He sucked in a quiet breath and appeared sort of apprehensive. “I’m not exactly sure how to say this without it sounding strange, but… I’ve been keeping an eye on you.”

“Excuse me...?” My breathing stilled for a moment and my eyes darted towards his door.

He instantly noticed my change in expression. “I- It’s not like that.” Stuttering over his words, he rubbed the bridge of his nose before saying, “What I mean is that I’ve noticed someone exiting your apartment… But I’ve never seen them enter.”

Every hair on my body stood on end at his words. “What… What do you mean?”

“What I mean is that I find it incredibly concerning that this person is somehow able to get into your apartment other than using your door…” His eyebrows were knitted together in worry. “Have you…” He paused. “Have you been noticing anything strange? Things moving in your apartment perhaps??”

I instantly paled. “I’ve been… Receiving strange notes. Sticky notes left in different places. Up until recently, they have only ever been in my apartment.”

“Well I just… I wanted you to know that I’m looking out for you. Whoever it is has been incredibly good at hiding their identity, because I cannot explain to you for the life of me what this person looks like.”

I watched as his hands carded through his hair. This man was just as on edge as I was, and in a way, it was almost sort of comforting to know that I wasn’t alone in feeling absolutely terrified.

“And you can’t recall any details about what this person looks like?” I questioned.

Scratching the stubble on his chin, he sat quietly for a few moments before commenting. “I honestly cannot tell you anything appearance wise. Every Time I’ve seen them leave, they have always been covered. Black hoodie, black pants, black shoes. I can only guess based on the height and build that it might be a man?”

“The handwriting on the sticky notes makes me believe that he is a man as well.”

Nodding, he sat in silence for a beat or two before he looked down at his watch. “Well, I’ve got some errands I need to run so I will see you out, but I just wanted you to know that I’d be on the lookout for any more suspicious activity.”

Reaching out, I shook his hand again and thanked him before leaving.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**TODAY**

In the end, I don’t know if meeting my neighbors really shed any light on the situation, but it was a relief to have my suspicions validated and to know that I wasn’t absolutely crazy. That someone had really been in my apartment. But then there was the chilling statement I’d heard him say that still continued to bother me… It was playing over and over in my head like some sick mantra.

*“What I mean is that I’ve noticed someone exiting your apartment… But I’ve never seen them* ***enter***.”

Somehow, whoever this psycho was, he was accessing my apartment… **From the inside.**
