I never expected to find myself writing one of these posts, but I’ve hit a wall and I need help. Desperately. What started as a curious puzzle has spiraled into something far more disturbing. I think someone is watching me, and they’re sending me messages I can’t fully understand. It’s no prank. At this point, I’m sure of that.

A little context: I’m a linguistics student, currently in my final year at university. I’ve always had a knack for languages and cryptography—decoding things has always been a hobby. So, when I found a letter in my mailbox two weeks ago, written entirely in a strange, unfamiliar script, I was intrigued.

The letter wasn’t sent through the post—there was no stamp, no address. It was just folded neatly and left there for me. Here’s what it looked like:

Vgq qtfv ykijv aqwv.

Below the strange symbols, in small handwriting, someone had kindly left the translation:

**You know what you did.**

My first reaction was confusion. What *did* I do? And who the hell would send me something like this? But more than anything, I was curious.

I’ve lived a pretty normal life. No major drama, no enemies (that I’m aware of). I assumed this was some weird prank or maybe someone mistaking me for someone else. But I have to admit, that phrase started to gnaw at me.

I brushed it off, but then this morning, another letter appeared. This time, it was slid under my door while I slept. And this time, there was **no helpful translation underneath**.

Here’s the second letter, written in the same symbols as before:

**"Aykq yknn rga hqt yjgp aqw jcxg fqpg, jg fkf pqvjkpia tqi."**

I’ve been staring at it all day.  Tried running it through every code-breaking technique I know, but nothing’s working. It’s like the key to deciphering this one is completely different, and I just can’t crack it.

That’s why I’m here. I need help. If anyone reading this has any experience with cryptography, languages, or even just a good eye for patterns, can you help me figure out what this second letter says?

Whoever is sending these letters seems to know things about me that I don’t understand. I can’t shake the feeling that this is personal, that someone is trying to communicate something serious—and maybe dangerous.

I’m not new to puzzles. I’ve scoured all the cryptography forums, reached out to the communities I’m a part of, even looked into  ancient languages, but I keep coming up empty. Every tool and method I know hasn’t been able to break this one. I’ve tried manual decoding, even reaching out to a few friends who share my passion for breaking codes. But it’s like this letter was written specifically to evade me.

The more time that passes, the more I feel like I’m being watched. I’ve checked the security camera outside my building, asked my neighbors if they saw anyone, but no one knows anything. It’s just me, these letters, and this creeping sense that something is very, very wrong.

Please—if anyone out there can help me, I’m running out of options. I don’t know what’s coming next, and I’m starting to lose sleep over it. The second letter has been sitting on my desk for hours, and I can’t bear to look at it anymore.

I’m hoping one of you can help me decipher this second letter because, honestly, I don’t know how much longer I can ignore the growing fear that whoever is sending these knows exactly what they’re doing and why they’re doing it to me.
