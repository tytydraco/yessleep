Chapter 1:

 

Raghav leaned back in his rickety chair, the cool night air from the open window brushing against his weary face. The police station was quieter than usual, the usual hum of chaotic activity replaced by the faint creaks of the old building settling. He glanced at his watch—11:30 PM. His shift was finally over.

He gathered his things, shoving crumpled papers into his bag, and stretched his stiff shoulders. It had been a long, exhausting day dealing with petty thefts and domestic disputes—nothing out of the ordinary, but the monotony had weighed on him more than usual. The thought of going home to his wife and two little girls made his lips curl into a tired smile.

As he stepped out of the station, his phone buzzed. Ignoring the call, he slipped the phone back into his pocket, not wanting any more distractions. The streets were almost deserted, save for a few late-night vendors packing up their carts. As Raghav walked past a dimly lit alley, he noticed a figure stumbling out—a man in a black hoodie, his face obscured. The man seemed to be in a hurry, almost colliding with Raghav before muttering a half-hearted apology and rushing away.

Raghav frowned but didn’t think much of it. The city was full of shady characters, and after a long shift, he didn’t have the energy to confront a random stranger.

When he reached his House, he felt an odd chill crawl up his spine. The door was slightly ajar, the lock broken and hanging limply. His heart pounded, and instinct took over. He pushed the door open cautiously, his police training kicking in as he scanned the dimly lit living room.

“Anjali? Girls?” he called out, voice trembling.

Silence.

His footsteps felt heavy as he moved deeper into the house. The soft glow of the hallway light flickered ominously. As he stepped into the hallway, his eyes fell on the horrifying sight—his two daughters lying motionless on the floor, blood pooling around their tiny bodies. A guttural scream tore from his throat, but his legs moved on their own as he stumbled toward the bedroom.

He pushed the bedroom door open slowly, and the sight made his stomach twist. Anjali lay motionless on the bed, her eyes wide open, staring lifelessly at the ceiling. Blood soaked the sheets, and Raghav’s mind refused to process the brutal reality. His knees buckled, and he collapsed to the ground, gasping for air as tears blurred his vision. His heart pounded so loudly it drowned out everything else.

“No... no... no...” he whispered, crawling towards Anjali. He touched her cold hand, hoping, praying, that it was all some horrific dream. But the metallic scent of blood was too real.

He screamed—a raw, anguished sound that tore from his chest. The world around him spun as he clutched his wife’s body, his fingers brushing over his daughters’ lifeless faces. He could still feel the warmth slowly fading from their skin.

The room seemed to close in on him, suffocating him in the weight of his loss. His mind threatened to break, and before he knew it, darkness claimed him, dragging him into a void of despair.

When he finally regained consciousness, dawn was breaking, and he was sprawled on the blood-soaked floor, his hands-stained red. Trembling, he forced himself to stand, his legs weak and unsteady. He pulled his phone from his pocket, hands shaking as he dialled emergency services.

The call was a blur—disjointed words and frantic explanations. Within minutes, police cars and ambulances filled the street, lights flashing like haunting beacons in the early morning light.

Raghav barely registered the officers guiding him out of the house, questioning him with cautious voices. Their faces were sympathetic, but their eyes held suspicion. He could feel their judgment like needles piercing his skin.

He sat on the curb, numb and disconnected from reality, as his colleagues combed through the crime scene. One of his superiors approached him—a stern-faced officer named Rajeev.

“Raghav, you’re the only one at the scene. Can you tell us what happened?”

Raghav shook his head, words stuck in his throat. “I... I don’t know... I just came home... and they were... they were dead.”

Rajeev hesitated. “Did you see anyone suspicious?”

“A man... in a black hoodie. I bumped into him on the way back. Didn’t think anything of it.”

Rajeev exchanged glances with the other officers. “We’ll need you to come down to the station. Just routine questioning.”

Raghav nodded numbly, barely registering as they guided him into a patrol car. The world outside the window blurred as his mind replayed the gruesome scene over and over.

The questioning lasted for hours—relentless, invasive, and suffocating. They treated him less like a victim and more like a suspect, scrutinizing every word, every movement. By the time they were done, Raghav felt hollow and broken.

When they finally let him go, it wasn’t with sympathy or comfort. It was with a quiet, harsh truth—he was now a suspect, suspended from his job, and forced to report to the station regularly. The whispers and sideways glances from his colleagues made it clear—they thought he had done it.

As Raghav trudged through the empty streets back to his desolate House, he knew his life would never be the same again. The world he had known, the family he had cherished—it was all gone.

And the man in the black hoodie haunted his thoughts, a sinister shadow lurking just beyond his grasp.

The journey to find the truth had begun, but with every step, Raghav felt himself slipping deeper into a darkness from which there might be no return.
