Maybe you won't believe me. I don't know. I need to tell you anyways. Who else can I tell? No one I know would believe me. I need to warn you... I think *IT* wants me to. You're probably more likely to believe me than the people I know in person. I'm sorry if this seems erratic.... it's hard for me to process what I saw. I'm on the verge of crying.

I saw *IT*. I saw it a few minutes ago. I don't know what to call it. *IT*, I think, might be the best term for the thing. Was it a demon? Or maybe a god? I don't know.

It came out of the floor in my bedroom, through a crack in the floorboard. I don't know why, nor how, for that matter. It had mouths inside of mouths in its face. Mouths with what looked like stars inside them. I saw galaxies forming and being destroyed. But there were no teeth, at least, none that I could see. I think I saw *Truth*, whatever that actually is.

Eyes were along its back? Was it a back? I don't know. Eyes....  the eyes were everywhere, not just on its face. It's eyes were like a rainbow. 

It was black. Black as an abyss. I haven't seen anything this dark before. It crawled towards me, as if it was a serpent with legs. I don't know how else to say it. It had at least six pairs of legs; I'm not sure. I didn't get the best look at all of it. But the legs had long and thin hands at the ends instead of feet. And it was long. It had to be at least ten feet long, I think.

It spoke to me. Its voice was soothing, somehow. But it sounded like a roar almost. I can't really put it into words. It pierced me to my very soul. I was freezing as it neared me, as it put its front pair of legs on the bed. It told me about *The Day*. I might be not be perfectly remembering this, but I'll try anyways. I'm trying my best right now to say everything. I'm shaking and it's taking a long time for me to type all this out.

It said to me, "The Day approacheth. The Day of Trials. The Day of Lights. Mankind shall be put to trial. Trial upon trial upon trial." I don't know. I don't know. I... I don't understand. I don't understand what any of this means....

But when it finished saying that, it turned around and crawled back into the crack in the floorboard. I waited a little bit, and so far, nothing else has happened. I fear its return.

Please. Please tell me if you have seen anything like this. I can't be the only one. Is some judgement coming? Was it a god? I don't understand. Please.... You *have* to believe me! Was this some trick? Was it playing with me? Is it trying to make me go mad? No.... It can't be. It has to be telling the truth. I don't know why, but I just know.
