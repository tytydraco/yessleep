The lake near my house is my favourite place to go for some isolated relaxation time. Some days I just lay in the sun soaking up the hot rays. Other days I'll walk in the water enjoying the crisp water on my skin. The lake floor is a soggy, muddy, seaweed covered mess. With each step away from shore the mud squishes between my toes. The once clear brown water awakens with each footstep. Glittering specs explode from the floor forming a dust storm of lake-bottom muck and algae. The lake floor gives some people the heebie jibes, but not me. The mystical muck reminds me of my childhood. When I was naive to germs and viruses. Back when I simply wanted to interact with nature. The lake bottom floor had so much to hide. I found some of my most favourite rocks hidden amongst the seaweed where so many fear to venture. Once, I even found a fossil. It was a simple shell outline on a small rock. I treasure that little fossil.

 

The muddy bottom does have its treacherous secrets though. I've accidently stepped on a large snake while wandering around the lake’s depths. Another time I kicked the largest snapping turtle. It felt like I had kicked the side of a building. Luckily, the turtle swam away upon impact instead of choosing to battle it out. *A battle I would have surely lost*. You do not want to mess with a Canadian snapper.  

 

A blue heron sounds above me, pulling me out of my reminiscing. I admire its wingspan and walk mindlessly forward following the flight path of the shrinking bird.

 

 Sharp. It hurts. Instincts kick in and I yank my right foot out of the water screaming a prolonged "fuck!". I clench my ankle between my hands and pull my foot upwards to better see the cause of my extreme pain. There is a long deep cut that travels from my toes to my heel. Layers of my skin have been sliced open exposing my muscles and veins. I scream - it echoes across the empty lake. Blood spits from my foot as I struggle to maintain my balance. The pain is so sharp. I grit my teeth tightly while trying to put pressure on my wound. I stare around frantically in search of a place to sit to better analyze the cut. Alas, I'm knee deep in a dirty lake with a huge cut on my foot.

 

I feel my heartbeat pound with panic as the realization that no one else is here to help me in my time of need. Of course, no one else is here, this is my space of solitude where I come to ‘relax’, “Fuck, this would happen to me” I mutter between sharp pain fueled inhales.

 

 I decide the best course of action is to hop towards shore while keeping my injured foot elevated in my hands. Without a second thought I take a small, calculated hop, towards shore.  Immediately, I vomit my salad lunch when my left foot slams down onto another sharp object.

 

The familiar sensation of my flesh being cut wide open floods my brain with despair.  I feel something collide hard into the bones of my feet.  I fall sideways in pain. Water splashes around me as I sink downwards. My screams of pain are lost in the water submerging me. Air leaves my mouth forming large bubbles that rush to the surface. My shoulders make an impact with the lake floor. Both my feet are gushing with blood leaving painted streaks of red in the murky water.  As I collide with the bottom of the lake a series of deep cuts slice deep into my shoulders.

 

Blood floats upwards all around me as fast as it pours from the slices across my shoulders.  I roll to the left towards shore desperately. I collide with the muddy floor and push myself to the surface with my hands. Nothing sharp, no new cuts. With haste, I check the lake floor further to my left for any sharp objects. Nothing. I roll again towards the left, being careful as my sliced back inches towards the floor. It is hard not to scream in pain with each movement.  I wince and stop briefly to check the muddy bottom for anything sharp before continuing to roll to the left.  Towards shore. Towards help.

 

Finally, I roll onto shore, landing on my stomach. I can hardly breathe. Every muscle in my back hurts. My feet hurt. The wounds in my body burn with a hot sensation, yet I shiver with cold. With shaky hands I reach slowly behind my back.  I feel for the cuts I know are there. A whimper falls from my trembling lips. I cry in pain. With each shiver my muscles spasm and blood pumps out of my body.  I can feel lake dirt grinding in my wounds with each of my movements. I cry unapologetically and move forward. The sensation of my thick blood pouring from the wounds has me dizzy. So much pain. Survival instincts kick in - I must save myself. My bag is 50 yards away. In my bag is my cell phone. I can call for help.  I must reach my bag. It seems so far with my injuries, but it is my only hope. Biting back the pain I use my knees, chest, and chin to drag my body forward. Each inch I manage to move closer to my bag is agony. Waves of murky lake water splash over my wounds as the sun burns into my back. I spit out grains of sand that I’ve managed to inhale as I scoot forward across the shore towards my bag.  After 10 yards I lose consciousness.

 

When I wake up it is nearly nightfall. I stare towards the water for a long time, unable to move. I feel numb. I know my bag is still so far from my reach. I know I’ve lost a lot of blood. I am prepared for defeat, prepared to die alone on the shore alone. There are no sounds. Even the waves colliding into my failing body have gone silent. Exhaling slowly, I begin to close my eyes, accepting my fate; a strangle ripple echoes beneath the surface of the water capturing my attention. I watch in horror as the water begins to cyclone downwards moving rapidly around the silhouette of a manlike creature. The creature climbs to the surface of the water. He is covered in shells, seaweed, and muck. It wields two scimitar blades, one in each hand. His face is hidden behind an opaque green blob that resembles an egg sac, only his black eyes are visible. I swallow hard as it stares at me from the lake with disdain. Fresh blood trickles off the blades of his scimitars into the water surrounding him. The realization that it is my blood coating his blades sends my heart racing. The egg sac clinging to his face blobs up and down with the screech of his laughter. He mocks me as I lay helpless like a fillet fish on the shoreline. 

 

Abruptly he stops laughing and stomps towards me. Somehow the expression on his blob covered face is frightening without obvious features of the bone structure below. With each stomp forward his face jiggles, his eyes narrow, his gaze zoned in on me. His large leather worn boots fall heavily as he steps onto the shore.  His boots are covered in layers of muck and zebra mussels.  The smell they are emitting is grotesque. I throw up all over his large boots.  He kicks the mess back at me, unloading years of disgust all over me.  Some of the mess splashes into my fresh wounds making me yelp in agony.  Again, the creature laughs. 

 

My vision is blurred from the mess.  I stare up at him begging for mercy as he raises both the scimitars above his head. The blades create an ‘X’ overtop of him.  His tattered poet shirt tightens around his biceps as he holds the heavy weapons over top of his enormous frame. Water drips from his soaked clothing as he yells up at the Gods before slamming the blades downwards at me. The blades sink into the sand an inch from my gaze.  I can see my horrified expression in the steel.  I watch with defeat as the creature drops to his knees in front of me.  He grabs a fist full of my hair with his algae coated hand and yanks my head back. His black eyes stare deeply into mine. Despite all my pain, all I can feel is fear. I stare back with wide eyes. A dark drop falls from his eyes onto my bare cheek.  Tears? I think to myself. The creature tilts his head with confusion as another dark tear falls from his eyes. These tears are unlike human tears.  They don’t fall from the corner of the eye.  This dark tear falls from the very center of its eye. I can’t stop focusing on the peculiarity of this.  The tears begin forming faster.  Tear after tear of dark liquid pours onto my face from the creature’s eyes. The smell is horrible, like the scent of decaying fish on the shoreline.

 

 

 I whimper in agony and the creature stops crying.  It is only now that I notice the sack on his face has shrunk substantially. It once was bulbous and full.  Now it lay empty across his face.  The creature throws me aside and reaches up to his own face.  With force he slowly tears an edge of the egg sac off his face.  He pulls slowly, peeling the sac off a few calculated pulls at a time. Strands of gooey skin and muscle string from the egg sac to the creature’s face with each tug.  A deep groan of pain splutters from the newly exposed mouth of the creature. Layers of his skin peel off with the egg sac showing the fleshed anatomy of a human entity.  Dark blood cascades down his jaw to his neck in a flow of putrid pus.

 

For what seems like hours I watch as the creature removes the egg sac from his face. His dark eyes dim with each tug of flesh from his body. With half the sac removed the creature tugs a scimitar from the sand and places the blade beneath the sac.  He grimaces and slices smoothly through the remainder of the flesh attaching the sac to his face. The egg sac pulses heavily in his hand like a beating heart in a freshly cracked chest. The creature stares at it with hatred before turning his gaze back to me. 

 

I lay on the beach immobilized from my own pain. The black tears covering my face have started to sting like an acid eating at my flesh. I watch in horror as the creature lowers the egg sac to my face. With precision, he lays it across my face. I try to inch away but my body is too weak. I protest the loudest I can with my frail voice. He ignores me and presses the warm sac flesh to my face.  I try to scream, but the sound is muffled by the egg sac.  Everything but my eyes is slowly covered by the egg sac.  The creature presses down the edges methodically ensuring the slimy membrane is glued down on my face. With a satisfied look the creature leans back on his heels and wipes the dark blood off his chin. Already his skin has started to change where the egg sac once resided. It is healing at an alarming rate, not only healing it seems to be transforming. It is captivating to watch the creature begin to morph as I lay in the sand struggling to breath beneath the sac. Even the dark eyes he possesses begin to lighten, shift, mold into the eyes of a much more human figure.

 

If it wasn’t for the sensation of thousands of small sharp teeth biting into my face, I could have watched the creature change for hours.  Beneath the egg sac I could feel little mouths feeding hungrily on the black tears covering my skin. The teeth clamp down on my flesh and hold their grip. I can feel their little tongues lap hungrily at the tears as they merge with my flesh. I panic and try to rip the egg sac off but before my fingers reach my face the creatures smack me over the head with the handle of the scimitar.

 

When I wake up, I find myself lying on the beach staring up at a star filled sky.  The pain in my body and face is gone. The cold night air bites at my skin forming goose bumps all over me.  I shiver and reach towards my face in memory of the horrible nightmare that was the creature of the lake. My fingers collide with a gooey surface, slick and smooth.  The egg sac pulses against my fingertips making me scream in horror.  The vibration of my scream makes the angry teeth monsters bite down with vigor into my flesh.  My eyes widen in pain.  I try to tear the egg sac off my face, but the pain is excruciating. I frantically search the dark beach for the creature that attached this thing to my face - I find him. He is wearing my backpack. He looks more like a human now than before.  He looks… a lot like me.  He smiles at me and tips his hat politely. I stand and sprint towards him but in an instance he has vanished. His two scimitars are stuck in the sandy beach where he once stood. Beneath the blades are two pieces of parchment paper rolled up and tied with ribbon.  One ribbon is orange, the other is purple.

 

I sob quietly as I fall to my knees and pull the parchment paper free of the scimitar blade. With haste I pull at the purple ribbon and unroll the parchment paper. As the words reveal themselves the orange ribbon parchment paper dissipates into thin air. I begin to sweat with panic not realizing I had a choice between one parchment or the other. I feel my eyelids grow heavy with tears. A black oily tear pools down my face onto the parchment.  I gasp in surprise realizing now that I now possess the eyes of the creature.  I close my eyes tightly trying to compose myself before opening them to read the words scribbled on the parchment: “The curse of Crimson lake is yours. For the next 100 years you will house the creature, protect the creature, and feed the creature. Those who visit Crimson lake and utter the words “wouldn’t it be scary if….” Are those who offer themselves to be feasted upon. Thank you for your service and your damned soul”.

 

 

My heart pounds beneath my chest as I read the words over and over. My black tears fall faster onto the parchment rendering the words illegible. I wipe the dark tears off onto my sleeve only to realize I am now dressed in the creature's poets shirt. I drop the note and scramble backwards away from the scimitars.  I shake my head violently while struggling to peel the egg sac off my face.  The little mouths bite down harder making me shake in agony. In the reflection of the blades, I see myself. The egg sac is large and full on my face revealing only my dark eyes.  My black tears have stained the white poet's shirt.  I am wearing muck covered boots and tattered slacks - I am horrifying. All individuality I once held has been stripped and replaced with the creature.  He is me; I am him.  I feel like I may throw up, but a series of little voices come from the egg sac telling me I better not. For some reason, I listen. The voices then encourage me to go into the lake. I listen as if my being is being controlled. The little voices tell me to walk deeper into the lake until I am completely submerged. I oblige. Beneath the weight of the water the egg sac provides me oxygen to breathe. The little mouths release their deep bites on my face ever so slightly rewarding me for my servitude.  The scimitars are in my fists, I don’t remember picking them up. In unison the thousands of mouths hum a majestic melody that forces me into a sleep like trance.  I lay down on the muck bottom of the lake and stare upwards towards the surface with my dark eyes.  The mouths continue to hum, keeping me locked in a sleep fueled state. I am helpless. My body feels at peace as the little voices hum.

 

I lay in place for months in the muck at the bottom of the lake slowly being covered by sediment and algae. Breathing methodically into the egg sac as the little mouths sing to me in unison. Many visit the lake. Blissfully unaware I am cursed and lulled into a sleep like trance. That is until one fateful day a lone couple floated above me in large tubes.  The woman says to the man “wouldn’t it be scary if there were sharks in the lake?”

 

The little mouths scream in unison and I feel my body begin to contort. It hurts not only me but the egg sac too. We all scream as my body twists and convulses.  I grow gills, a tail, and teeth.  My body stretches and grows until I take the form of a giant great white shark. The egg sac clings to my chin and the little voices grunt in one orchestrated tune “feast on their flesh”. 

 

I do as I am told and swim rapidly up to the surface.  The woman is who I attack first. Biting and tearing at her right leg until it is free from her body. Their screams tug at the human consciousness left in me, but the little mouths tell me to feed more, they are starving. With my many rows of teeth I spend the next hour devouring the couple, ripping body part after body part from their torsos. The only thing left of them is their crimson-coloured blood staining the lake. The little voices begin to hum again, satisfied with their meal.  I swim to the bottom of the lake and my body slowly transforms back into my human state with the egg sac covering my face once again.  The little voices thank me for my service and sing me back to my sleep like trance.  I stare up at the stained red lake water and watch in marvel as their blood moves with the waves. Here is where I must lay until the curse has ended, the curse of Crimson lake – Wouldn’t it be scary if?
