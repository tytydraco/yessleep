This story just took place 24 hours ish ago as I just turned 18) I am living in my own condo and I was just coming back from my party, celebrating me and my friends 18th birthday (yes we were born on the same day). 

The story really starts once I had left the party. I say my goodbyes to my friends (obviously completely worn out and feeling all of the after effects of a party like this). Anyway, I ring an uber to come pick me up from the party. So I enter the Uber and immediately greeted by a man. 

Now, thinking back, I should have probably just gotten one of my friends to drop me off as something was amiss as I will share with you. I am greeted by the driver, and, as I would expect, the driver definitely did not want to be there, with his dreary eyes and his stressed look about him. With the time being around two to three in the morning, it made sense for him to be looking like this. We set off, and a little while later, I catch a small glimpse of the man from the rear view mirror. His mood had seemed to have changed. Completely different from the man who picked me up, as his eyes seemed to be fully dilated and facial structured somewhat the same but still energised. Startled, I jumped a little.

What really scared me was his smile. That smile was just plain awful. He looked so misshapen, so tyrannical, all I could do was stare and keep my eyes locked on him. He (although I would consider him to be an ‘it) opens his mouth (while still locking eyes with me) and announces that the destination had been reached. I step out of the Uber and immediately I am greeted with an usual amount of fog and what looks like lights coming out of my house. I navigate through the fog, and enter through the door. 

At this point I really should have been on high alert, but in my tired state I brush it off and forget about it. I go and do my usual bits as I do in the evening like teeth brushing, showering etc. As I go do one last check of the house (to see if all the doors are locked and turning off all the lights). As I look outside to see if the fog had cleared, I find that it has. However, my gaze meets the Uber. God I really wish I didn’t. I don’t know if the outcome of this story would be changed, but looking at that smile really sparked a real sense of fear and regret.

This thing, this smile (not even the man) seemed to be searching and looking for me, wanting something. I back up from the window and I rush to turn on the light of the room, and holy shit. The man, the man was walking to my house. I begin to dial 999, but as quick I turned on the lights, it went away. I ran to the window, and, to my surprise, there was nothing there. I collapse on my bed and let out a huge sigh of relief, thinking I was just hallucinating and drift into sleep. Around 2 hours later id say, while still fast asleep, I feel a sharp scratching sensation in my back. I slowly wake up and this scratching feeling slowly becomes more and more intense, turning into a very intense and fast paced prodding feeling, like a kid annoying their parents to wake up on Christmas day.

 As this becomes more and more intense, I feel a sharp, cold breath as if there was someone or something hovering right above me, waiting for me to awaken. I slowly come to my senses (scared shitless) and as I do I feel a sensation of paralysis overcome me. (This will be important later) I then snap out of it and fully wake up, looking around, afraid and panicked. At this point, I don’t think any sane person would want to go back to sleep after what had just happened, so I go downstairs to make some coffee, to energise myself. 

Peculiarly, as I wait for the coffee to be made, I realise that I did not turn any of the lights off in my house, which I swore I did (again, this is important as you will find out later). Now here’s where I really should have started to panic. I go back upstairs to find my phone, but I fail to find it. I use the only ancient home phone to ring it, to locate it, however, to my surprise, it picks up. Shocked, I decide to listen.

 After a few seconds of a somewhat loud silence, I hear some shuffling and what sounded like a low, raspy laugh. 

"What the fuck?" I think to myself. I then look around wearily and I guess I had some sense of panic, as what the fuck was that? I recollect myself, and build up the courage to put the phone down and ring again. This time it actually rings, and I locate the source. The kitchen. The same kitchen where I had been making coffee. The same kitchen I had been standing clueless in. I let out an audible gasp, recollect my thoughts and just dash for the kitchen and grab my phone. A note. A scrunched, somewhat charred and barely readable note. I reach out to pick it up and read it. I can’t really summarise, or still believe, the note, so I will just repeat what it said (this note will be engraved in my memory forever).
 
 
Hey! So I bet there’s been some weird shit going on within the past 24 hours of your life. I would say don’t worry, but now is a time to be on high alert and collected. I will explain everything in due course. FIRST STEP. I should have mentioned this before, but DO NOT LOOK AWAY. Do not react to sudden movements in your vision, do not look away. This note is the thing keeping you alive. Please trust me. We are your only hope. Try not to blink or close your eyes. It’s not worth it believe me.

 Ok. Now that the most important step is out of the way, listen. So, allow me to explain. We are a group, kind of like the ghostbusters, but with real life shit. Now, you being 18 plays a very important role. When you turn 18, from what we know, each and every one of them is implanted with a serum of sorts. 

We still don’t fully know why, or what for that matter, this serum is consisted of. All we know is that there are creatures, things from other planets who wants this serum. All these activities begun to pop up on our radar just a few weeks back, meaning these things are after something, and they want it bad. Only now, within the past week or so, they seemed to have become more developed and able, which is terrifying. All of this may be very hard to believe, but please stay with me, for the safety of us both. Anyway, recently, they have somehow gotten a hold of this serum, and that’s bad news. In your case, you have gotten severely unlucky and lucky at the same time.

 Unluckily, they have seemed to have developed a new technology which mimics a mist (what we know as fog) and it can be sprayed and precisely used on certain areas, the front of your house for instance. From what we know, this fog has abilities which include a form of mind control, misdirection, and can enter the human body. For you, you have been somewhat lucky, as only the last 2 have affected you. Now here’s the real kicker. You know that serum? Well, they seemed to be able to precisely locate the serums’ location before it enters your body, as if they were able to track it like a heat signature of sorts.

 In your case, the serum was probably as a gas and in the air somewhere, ready to enter your body. However, the fog combatted this, and kind of blocked it from getting anywhere near you. The house you’re staying in? Yeah, it’s not yours.

 As I mentioned, the misdirection has seemed to have worked, as you are only staying in a mimic of your own house, this is not your home. DO NOT PANIC NOW, you are doing great. So, we know that the penetration and misdirection part has worked, which may not be the best for you. Right now, you could be experiencing some hallucinations, keep your eyes on the page. This is especially important now, as they may know you are aware of them, and begin to act faster. Keep cool. The rest of the things you experienced, such as the man in the car, I will do my best to explain. Your driver, he was a normal uber driver. These creatures however, they are much smarter than us.

 You familiar with skinwalkers? Well, the same kinda concept applies here. Through some sci-fi bullshit, they gained control of the drivers mind, and took you to your destination, but kept an eye on you, which is when you saw that thing searching for you. Right now, it is entirely possible that they are watching over you, but we just don’t know. For the past weeks, we have been able to keep these situations under control and stopped the serum from being in the reaches of those things, but they are growing more intelligent and smarter each day, and this situation has become the worst it has, unluckily for you. 

From our data, there is still hope for you, as they have not been able to obtain the serum yet. As this has never happened before, we have no idea what happens if you don’t receive that serum, as the last girl that was to receive it and didn’t? Completely flew off our radar.

 Maybe making you aware of the serum could be putting you in danger, however its best to take risks at times. We believe that the lights in your house act as small homes for these creatures, so DO NOT TURN THEM OFF. Do not release them. Turning off the lights may startle them and cause them to become aggressive. This brings me onto step 2. Anything that seems out of the ordinary, such as the lights, do not change them. That painting in the hallway? If it seems off, let it be. Do not disturb them. Very simple, and I’m sure you are very capable of following this. 

Step 3. You got lucky, the sleep paralysis did not seem to fully set in, however do NOT go back to sleep. No matter what. All of this random shit that you are seeing, feeling and experiencing is all a part of their way to gain entry, to break down the kind of mental fortress that you have, in simple terms. So that sleep paralysis wasn’t really sleep paralysis, it was kind of a provocation in order for you to begin to panic.

 Going back to sleep would have possibly allowed them to stay around, if you know what I mean. Don’t give in, just like you have been, so good job. Step 4 don’t leave your house either. I can’t really explain but walking back out there probably will cause more misdirection and possibly allow the fog to fully gain access to you. Stay away from things like reflections. Not for the reason that they will jump out of the mirror or shit like that, but you may see things you will never unsee. OK now you know for the most part what to do. Let me explain the next 48 hours of your life to you. Although we are watching, we cannot interfere, if that makes you feel any better. Now listen very carefully. After finishing reading this note, turn around, and head to the fridge. DO NOT DO THIS NOW. Take any foodstuffs out of it and eat it. 

Go on your phone, with volume as to not arouse their suspicions as to why there is no sound. They are extremely smart. We can watch but cannot interfere. If you are beginning to drift to sleep, please don’t. If you find this does happen however, turn on your TV and go to a channel you haven’t seen before. We can watch but cannot interfere. We can watch but cannot interfere. WE CAN WATCH BUT CANNOT INTEFERE.
 
And that was the end of the note, a long one I know. After this, I knew I that this was my only hope and I just decided to go with it. I sat down, taking it all in. As my eyes graced each word, I was in a complete state of panic and tremor. The worst part about it all. The worst part was that the part after the creepy cryptic kind of message at the end, was that it was completely ripped off. So, I was completely in the dark. I figured my best bet was to simply follow the instructions and do my best to survive. To this day, I still have no idea if this was sick and twisted practical joke, but what kind of practical joke would be able to pull off all these abnormal events? Anyway, I go to grab some food from the fridge and sit down. 

Ah fuck. About an hour later I jerk my head up from the crusty pizza from a week ago, and that’s when I see it. 
“HOW DID YOU GET IN MY HOUSE?” I scream in dread, knowing this could possibly be it. It just stands there, fucking stands there with fully blacked eyes and that dreaded smile. It lets out a low pitched, intimidating laugh, and reaches its hand out to me, like some Michael Myers shit. 

“I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT LEAVE ME ALONE!” At this point, I realise what I did. I fell asleep. The final thing the note said not to do. I begin to feel my throat clench up and I dash for the TV, the thing it said to do but didn’t explain. What did it mean?? ‘We can watch but cannot interfere’ It kept repeating that. Over and over. Maybe it was a secret message? Or the person who wrote me the note was just going crazy, just how I was starting to feel; both petrified and frozen in fear. I snap out of it and continue to dash for the TV. I scramble the remote, feeling the same icy cold breath as I felt before coating my neck. I dash to the side, turning the TV on. I switch to a random channel and wait. Nothing. 
“Ah fu-” I let out as I turn around and see nothing but darkness. 

“Please leave me be, I don’t know what you want”, I was just completely defeated at this point. I knew what was coming. I just didn’t know if I was accepting it. The paintings on the walls began to spin, as my head did. If the so called ‘ghostbusters’ couldn’t stop them, what the fuck could I do? I knew I couldn’t go outside; the note told me all about the fog. 

Then the fog. The fog made its return.
 
“Fuck” I exclaimed.

My only way out was the front door. I dashed for the door and just ran. I ran till I found the next town, and here I am. Telling you this story. I am uploading this with some internet I found at a random café, and I hope this uploads in time. For everyone almost turning 18, stay safe. I will try to keep you updated and posted on the situation.
