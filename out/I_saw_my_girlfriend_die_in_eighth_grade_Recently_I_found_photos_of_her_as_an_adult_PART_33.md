I sat down at my kitchen table with the papers I had found, hoping they would explain the mysterious pictures of a life I never got to live, a life together with Julia. My hands trembled as I unfolded the papers in front of me. It was a long e-mail that had been sent to me in April 1998.

\*\*\*

Dear Benjamin,

I can only hope that this message reaches you in time. I know it will be hard for you to believe me, impossible even, but together with the evidence that I attached you should at least find it within yourself to consider it. It must be just recently that Julia kissed you for the first time and whispered those enchanted words in your ear. They’ll inspire you to follow her, to be part of something greater than yourself. And you’ll be happy together. There’s no doubt about it. For a long time, your life will be better than you ever thought possible. Please understand why, then, this message is the hardest thing I’ve ever written.

During our final march through the nuclear wasteland of England, we found the ruins of the Leif Andersson Institute in what was once London. They had built a device there that allowed us, a small group of dissidents within the empire, to send a message back in time. I know such a sentence will be very difficult for you to take seriously, but I implore you to continue reading. The year, at the time of writing this, is 2047. We don’t have much time. For you, it’s only 1998 and time is on your side.

Let me tell you what will happen to you if the timeline is allowed to continue on its natural course. There are only a few of us left… the few of us who still remember the early days. And I’m one of them, perhaps the one with the most insight into our history. I’ll tell you the story in past tense since that is how it happened from my perspective, even though for you it’s still nothing more than a dream of what’s to come.

Only a week after Julia kissed you, some of the targets were being given to Oliver’s cohort. They were mostly given pedophiles who had set up meetings with what they thought were twelve-year-old girls. It was a simple tactic that proved effective. Oliver and his friends showed up, wearing Roman theater masks that made them look terrifying even to the other cohorts, and attacked the unsuspecting victim with baseball bats that they had stolen from the gym at school and painted black. Oliver wasn’t ordered to kill, and to avoid it they were instructed to beat the victims in a very specific manner, with a specific number of blows to specific body parts, which made it look almost ritualistic. On some occasions in the beginning, you were ordered to observe these attacks from a safe distance just to make sure Oliver was following protocol, and you were happy to do so for the woman you loved even though you never had a taste for violence. Julia was too busy building what would become the Forum. It was an updated version of the Castrum but served as a web page aimed at the public. It bore the same red aesthetics as the Castrum but without the symbols of the legion and allowed the users to create their own profiles and add each other as friends. Julia insisted on forcing the users to register with their real names, abolishing the idea of privacy that had been a natural part of the internet thus far. She was happy to share her thoughts on this:

“It’s simple. Information is going to be more valuable than oil in the future. It will be an asset, not only to satisfy the legion’s never-ending need for new targets but also for our financial needs. That’s why we need the users to share as much information about themselves as possible. It makes sense if you think about it. We’ll give the users the electronic bread and circuses that they crave, and all they need to offer us in return are their souls!”

Oliver’s cohort grew in numbers and a few other cohorts teamed up with them on their offline missions, but Julia wasn’t satisfied. She wanted the brutal attacks to seem more civilized. The first time Julia yelled at you was when you questioned her decision to bring parts of the legion’s choir to the offline missions.

“Don’t you understand? We aren’t fucking troglodytes! We’re trying to *restore* the glory of civilization, not ruin it with some half-assed messy bullshit. Violence must always be shrouded in order and beauty or else it will be nothing more than savagery.” She calmed down, took a deep breath, and said, “The hymn must echo above the heads of the damned.”

You never questioned her again, and during the next mission—when a family house where the father was raping his daughter was invaded by Oliver’s cohort—the hymn of the legion was sung as the family watched Oliver and his boys strike the father over and over and over again with their bats until his spine snapped. And then you entered the house together with Julia, both wearing masks with neutral expressions, and Oliver and the others greeted you with their arms extended proudly.

“Ave Imperator,” Oliver said and the others followed suit. “Ave Imperator!”

You saw that Julia was happy, and all the anxiety that you had felt after she yelled at you was immediately replaced with elation.

As it turned out, these offline missions were only a mere exercise. A bigger mission was being planned, a mission that Julia claimed would finally allow the cohorts to prove themselves to the legion. No one really knew what it was, but everyone still did the tasks they were given. One cohort was ordered to steal some materials from the woodwork room at school, another to acquire more capes and masks, and yet another to scout one of the poorest neighborhoods for a suitable location. Not even you knew all the details, although you knew the target: Los Bárbaros.

Once a location had been picked—a shabby soccer field behind an abandoned loading dock—the cohort managing target manipulation arranged a fake meeting with the street gang, posing as drug buyers. Los Bárbaros was a small group of six boys, considered a menace in the neighborhood but not viewed as anything more than pathetic thugs by the gangs who actually controlled the drug trade in the area. Hence, Los Bárbaros was most likely overjoyed when we reached out to them, giving them the illusion of not being wannabe gangsters anymore.

Everyone who could sneak out at night was ordered to the soccer field. About twenty members from different schools managed to come, all wearing the red capes and masks that had been given to them earlier. They all hid from view in some bushes. Oliver’s cohort, together with you and Julia, were the only ones not hiding. Los Bárbaros arrived on their mopeds. It was too dark for them to see our masks from a distance, and when they noticed, they had reached the point of no return. Their leader snorted, taking a puff of his cigarette with a somewhat exaggerated motion of his hand as if to come off as larger than he really was.

“What’s this, some kind of masquerade?”

Julia took her mask off and exposed her calm face.

“Julia, i-is that you?” one of the younger boys stuttered. “Guys, it’s Julia!”

“What is going on here?” the leader said with uncertainty in his nasal voice. “What the fuck are you doing here?” He reached for a knife in his pocket. “Who the fuck are these motherfuckers, anyway? Crazy psycho bitch, just like your goddamn sister!”

Julia appeared mostly calm, but she had tensed up her jaw.

“We’re here to inform you that you have been sentenced to death for the horrendous crime committed toward my sister, Tavia Marcell, and for all subsequent crimes you’ve been committing ever since and would have continued to commit if you and your companions would have been allowed to live on.”

“What the fuck did you just say to me, bitch?” the leader said, confused. “No one comes to my hood speaking to me like that. Threatening me with fancy words like some fucking—”

Oliver blew a trumpet that he had stolen from the music hall and the sound echoed solemnly between the concrete buildings that made up the neighborhood.

Slowly, the others came out from their hiding spots, marching toward the center from the entrance as a solid column, making it impossible for Los Bárbaros to escape. The gang members pulled out their knives as they were surrounded by the legion. At the end of the column, one cohort dragged long wooden beams behind them.

“Julia, what the fuck is this shit?” the leader said, his eyes darting around in a nervous fashion. “This ain’t funny.”

“It’s the legion,” the youngest of the gang members said. “I have one of their members on my ICQ.” He put his knife on the ground with a trembling hand. “I-I’m sorry, I wasn’t involved... Tell them, tell them that I wasn’t there that night. Please.” He was begging his friends. “I’m innocent. Okay? Please.”

“Pick up your knife, fucking coward!” the leader said. “These fucking dorks can’t do shit, you hear me? We are gonna cut’em up!”

The soldiers dragging the beams began nailing them together.

“What are they doing, Julia?” the boy trying to save himself said. “I didn’t touch your sister… I promise. Please!”

Julia didn’t pay him any attention. “Olivarius, execute the sentence.”

Los Bárbaros tried to fight back, swinging their knives at everyone attacking them, but they didn’t stand a chance. They were beaten to the ground. Oliver’s cohort held them down. The leader of the gang went pallid as he must have realized that they would escape with neither lives nor honor.

“P-please,” he begged, spitting blood, “let my little brother go… please. He didn’t do nothing, I swear, please!”

His brother wailed like a child as he begged, “Mom, please, Mom...”

“You’re trying to defend him with the very crime he committed!” Julia exclaimed. “He knew, and yet he did nothing.”

“What the fuck, no!” the leader yelled as he struggled even harder but still just as uselessly. “He’s just a kid—”

“You didn’t seem to think so a moment ago,” Julia said, “when you asked him to pick up his knife.” She paused, ignoring their cries for mercy, and then she turned to Oliver and spoke with a stern voice, “Do it. Interficite barbaros.”

“Centurion Filippus!” he yelled. “Commence the beating.”

Every soldier stepped forward and ritualistically broke every bone in the victims’ bodies with their baseball bats.

As Legion Legat, you didn’t have to participate in the beating. It was a great relief to you, as you never enjoyed hurting people, even if they were your enemies. All you had to do was stand beside Julia and watch all of this unfold in front of you. You had a clear view of their faces as their screams filled the air and their blood stained the ground.

Before they were dragged to the wooden beams, Oliver used one of their knives to cut their tongues out so that they wouldn’t be able to speak anymore. As he sliced the knife into their flesh, they screeched like feral animals and flailed about uselessly as they were restrained. After this, as if hit with a stroke of diabolical genius, he shouted toward his men:

“Pull their pants down!” He was met with confusion. “Just do it, pull them down. We don’t got all night!”

Still unsure, they looked upon Julia.

“Follow your orders.” As she spoke, she looked at the members of Los Bárbaros with utter detestation in her eyes.

“O-of course, Dominus.” With shaky hands, they began unbuttoning their pants.

As his private parts were exposed for everyone to see, tears finally formed in the eyes of the leader who had so far only dressed his agony in anger and hatred. Now, only a profound sadness remained on his tortured face. Once more, Oliver cut the knife into their flesh.

One of the legionaries at the back leaned forward and vomited behind his mask. Another one tried to get away but was stopped by one of the cohorts.

“What the fuck are you doing?” The centurion grabbed him by the arm and forced him to stay. “You can’t leave.”

This was a watershed moment for the legion, as some of the members began to show considerable doubt for the first time. Only a few of the attending legionaries had been on violent offline missions prior. Some hadn’t even seen blood before, let alone been a part of such a heinous performance. As Oliver proceeded, Julia, sensing the doubt among the crowd, straightened her back and addressed the legionaries.

“Crastati!” she shouted. “Crastati! Crastati! Crastati!”

The legionaries, caught up in the moment, began to chant along with her.

"Crastati! Crastati! Crastati! Crastati! Crastati!”

The group pressure was too much for the dissenters and they reluctantly joined in the chanting, forcing them to participate and share not just the twisted bacchanalian spirit of the group but also the blame for its actions. Julia made sure no one would return home with a clean conscience.

Oliver, feeling the support of the crowd, redoubled his efforts. Strange guttural noises of panic escaped the street gang’s bleeding, gurgling mouths as he proceeded with a sadistic smile. He then shoved their genitals into each other’s mouths to add to the humiliation. It was such a gruesome sight to behold that you didn’t dare to watch for too long. Instead, you turned your head toward Julia, who was the only one revealing her face at this time. She watched the execution with great pride in her eyes, and although you couldn’t stomach seeing the mutilation of these boys yourself, you felt happy for her.

The victims were then dragged to the wooden beams, and their wrists were nailed to the crossbeams. They were still conscious, although barely so, and they still tried to twist and turn in foolish attempts at escaping their humiliating fate. A placard was hung around their necks that read “RAPIST,” although Julia did refrain from placing it around the neck of the little brother, and then everyone helped with raising the beams and rooting them into the ground.

When the crucifixion was complete and they were all slowly dying on their crosses, the choir began singing the hymn of the legion. And one by one everyone—even you, Benjamin—joined in on the singing as you watched the lives of Los Bárbaros come to their excruciating conclusion:

>*Dominus! Dominus! Dominus!*  
>  
>*You arrived the month of May*  
>  
>*With a smile so glorious!*  
>  
>*Oh, that unforgettable spring day.*  
>  
>*From Stockholm to Canberra*  
>  
>*From the west to the east*  
>  
>*Barbarians roamed free on Terra*  
>  
>*Nothing could stop the beast!*  
>  
>*Until you came...*

>

>  
>*But you remain victorious*  
>  
>*In the end, they shall pay*  
>  
>*Thus is the Roman way!*  
>  
>*Over your sister you cried*  
>  
>*We hear you as you say*  
>  
>*That the empire never died!*

>  
>*Oh, that unforgettable spring day.*

The following day they were dead. This was the first time the work of the legion ended up on the news. Someone had taken a picture of the crosses in the morning haze before they were taken down. The news of the incident spread all over the world. During this time, the police still hadn’t taken notice of the legion, but you all knew that it was just a matter of time until they did. You became even more secretive than before. The Castrum was uploaded to a more secure server, and what we called the offline cohorts were divided into cells whose deeds were kept a secret from the rest of the legion.

These cohorts were mostly ordered to either recruit street gangs to the legion or to eradicate them. Oliver was promoted to general, and thus became the first member other than you and Julia allowed to wear a purple hood and cape. The crucifixions were limited to what were dubbed special representations of evil but were still carried out often enough during 1999 to keep making headlines all over the world.

Most people seemed to believe it had something to do with Christianity, even though that didn’t make much sense, and that it all had been inspired by the coming turn of the millennium. The church found the practice particularly immoral and demanded a full-blown national investigation, but the general population soon realized that the victims were the kind of scum that the police had failed to do something about for years.

Next year was ninth grade, the last year of high school. You still couldn’t fathom how much your life had changed since the days of the bullying. All that felt so far away for you now, almost as if it had happened in another life. Julia launched the Forum this year, and it quickly became a popular online community. Although she was still considered the Imperial Legate, you were the one administering most of the legion at this point.

A few days before prom, Julia called you late one evening to ask you to be her date. This, above anything else, even though objectively it was far from the most extraordinary event to have happened since you met Julia, felt like the culmination of something much larger. Until now, what you and Julia had been sharing felt like a tentative, fragile thing—something that could’ve been easily broken or taken away. Before this, your relationship hadn’t felt quite real to you, as though at any moment you might wake up and discover that it was all just a dream. But this request felt different. It felt like a promise. For the first time, your love would be seen by others and that made it somehow truer than it had been before. For a moment, you just stared at the phone in disbelief, unsure of how to respond. But then, a wide smile spread across your face as you realized that finally, after all these years, you finally had someone.

“Yes,” you said, barely able to contain your excitement. “Yes, of course, I’ll go to prom with you.”

You arrived at Julia’s house on prom night, flowers in hand and wearing the suit your dad had bought you for the occasion. You’d been so nervous sitting in the cab on the way there that you’d almost thrown up. You expected Julia’s parents to welcome you, but they were nowhere to be seen. Instead, it was Julia who answered the door.

“Hey,” she said, smiling. She was wearing a beautiful white dress that flowed down to her feet with an intricate gold pattern stitched into the fabric. Her hair was done up in an elegant updo, and she was wearing a thin gold necklace with a small pendant. She reminded you of a Roman goddess.

“You look beautiful,” you said, breathless. You felt like you were going to faint.

Julia laughed and took your arm. “Come on, let’s go,” she said. “You came here in a cab, right?”

“It’s waiting out front.”

“Good,” Julia said. “Because I’m not sure I can walk in these heels.”

You laughed and helped her down the steps.

Everyone stood up when you entered the school together, saluting both of you with outreached arms. It was one of the best days of your life. The school choir sang a beautiful rendition of *Bella Ciao*—a subtle nod to the presence of Julia and Legion Zero—and as the sun began to set, you and Julia walked out onto the dance floor, hand in hand. There, in front of everyone, you shared your first dance together. Oliver stood by himself at the edge of the room, watching as you danced and laughed and whispered secrets to each other. At one point, you saw him talking to one of his friends, and it looked like they were arguing. But soon enough, Oliver’s friend had walked away, leaving Oliver standing alone once again. And that’s when you saw it—clearer than ever before—the pain in his eyes, the hurt, and the jealousy. But even through all of that, he managed to smile and wave when your eyes accidentally met his. The night went on in a blur, and before you knew it, it was time to go.

When you were leaving, Oliver sneaked up on both of you together with his closest men. He forced you into an alley where there were no witnesses. He had put on his hood and mask and held his baseball bat tight.

“You love him?” Oliver said, radiating contempt as he spoke. “You love *him*?”

“What are you doing here?” you asked. “Y-you can’t act like–”

Julia placed her hand on your shoulder, calm as ever. “I love him, yes.”

Hearing this—which she had never told you before—sent a shockwave through your body. You turned to look at her, but she was staring at Oliver, unflinching.

“No,” Oliver said. “There’s no way… I did everything you asked of me. I *killed* for you.”

“And now you’ll kill us?” you asked. “Because she didn’t love you back?”

Hearing your voice triggered something within him, a rage you had never seen in his eyes before, and he looked back at his men as if to tell them to strike at his command. But just as he raised his black baseball bat, he fell to the ground. At first, you didn’t understand what had happened. Oliver touched the back of his head and looked at his hand, confused by the blood on his palm. His best friend, who had always been at his side, had struck him from behind with his bat. It was surreal for you to watch Oliver fall to the ground after being betrayed by his own friend. At that moment, everything he had done, everything he had made you go through over the years, felt like nothing. And yet, at the same time, it was strangely satisfying to see him get what he deserved.

“I love you, Olivarius,” his friend said. “But I love the legion more.”

“You son of a bitch!” Oliver hissed, holding back tears as his mask fell off. “I trusted you!”

“Let the decimation commence,” Julia said. “I’m sorry it had to end this way, general. I’m grateful for everything you did for the legion… for me.”

Oliver, still sitting on the ground, looked up at his friends begging, “No, please, we don’t need them! Do you hear me? I’m your general, you have to follow my orders!”

“I’m the general now,” his friend said. “You never understood the glory of the legion. For you, the legion was merely a means for violence, but it is violence that is merely a means for the legion… For civilization.”

“B-but that’s just bullshit,” Oliver said. “We always joked about how ridiculous it all was!” He turned to Julia. All the rage had disappeared from his face and been replaced by what could only be described as resignation. Slowly, knowing full well he wouldn’t get out of this alive, he extended his arm in the form of the salute and said with an ironic, hateful smirk, “Ave Imperator, those who are about to die salute you.”

Those were his last words, proving how much he had studied just to impress the woman he loved, before being clubbed to death by his own friends.

Upper secondary school was different. Julia was accepted into yet another prestigious school. Neither your grades nor wealth was good enough for that school, but in the end, Julia hacked their records so that you could come with her. The legion only had a few members at that school, and the culture that had evolved at your former school didn’t exist here. No more secret salutes in the corridors, no more “salve, Dominus” every time you entered a room. For a while, your life felt somewhat normal again. But nothing had returned to normal, far from it.

At the beginning of 2001, cohorts had begun to form in other countries and the Forum became an international webpage. Every private message on the site was read and stored by the legion. At the end of the summer that year, a message sent through the site in Arabic was translated. It revealed a terrorist plot against the US, where a cohort had formed recently. It was promptly ordered to intervene, and on September 8, the perpetrators were stopped in their tracks. The legion ended up on the news the next day, described as a vigilante organization, although the crucifixions of the victims were described as unnecessarily cruel and difficult to understand.

With access to all the data generated through the Forum, the legion was able to spot more than just petty criminals and predators. It also identified corrupted politicians and conspiracies. Julia focused on a lot of the widespread corruption in Italy and also within the Vatican. She was opposed to any and all Abrahamic religions, but nothing could make her as upset as the Catholic church.

“Monotheistic religions are the greatest corruption of man,” she said. “It’s like a virus of the mind, reprogramming the host’s brains… repurposing them to spread the disease at all costs. It’s beyond me how the freaking *Bible* gained more popularity than the *Odyssey*. It’s like comparing the phone book to great literature for fuck’s sake!”

When powerful politicians and priests and so on began to appear hanging on crosses in empty fields, the legion was categorized as a terrorist organization—even though you always provided evidence of the crimes the victims had committed. Even though Julia had detached herself from the legion for quite some time and destroyed all evidence of her involvement, she was still worried that the police would arrest her.

During the three years that followed before graduation, the Forum became one of the biggest online communities in the world. In 2004, Julia had already become a multi-millionaire. The youngest ever in your country. She formed her own company, called the Strix Corporation, and although she didn’t give you any position within the company, she made sure that you would never have to worry about money again.

Strix made it possible for Julia to secretly fund the legion, but also to spread propaganda directly to the members—mostly the members living in Italy.

At this point, it makes little sense to continue telling the story in such great detail. You took the title of Imperial Legate while Julia became a public figure. Within the legion, she was never again referred to as Julia. Only as Caesar.

Slowly, a strange kind of chaos erupted all over the world. In the west, the cohorts operated in the shadows with secret help from the ever-growing Strix Corporation. They assassinated key figures in high positions, burned down government buildings, tore down vanity projects wasting tax money, and attacked failing institutions. All of this caused civil unrest and radicalization both within the population and among politicians. Julia called it anti-social engineering.

The legion didn’t work as much in the shadows in the Middle East. There, the cohorts were provided firepower to fight back against dictatorships and terrorist groups. At the same time, the Forum fed the population with more and more propaganda, pointing their rage in whatever direction Julia saw fit.

In 2010, Julia made the decision to move back to Italy where she bought a small private island off the coast of Sicily. There, she began the construction of the company’s new headquarters. The building complex was huge, and when it was finished it looked like an ancient Roman palace made out of black marble. Julia’s new home became known as the Villa Strix.

This became your life. You moved into Julia’s palace and controlled the legion through secure channels. And you were happy, happy to share your life with Julia.

Julia often sat behind her massive desk in her gigantic marble office, and every time you walked by her, watching her work or staring at the world map with dreamy eyes, you felt like the luckiest man in the world. You thought back on your life, on those horrible days before Julia saved you with her warm embrace, and you shuddered at what life would have been like if you had never met her. That’s why I know reading this is so hard for you. After all, from where you are right now, you’re still just a boy in love.

In 2019, there were massive protests against the Catholic Church in Rome, a direct result of the constant revelations of child abuse within the church. Julia wouldn’t let them live it down, and constantly fed Forum members with news about the atrocities. At the same time, she had worked hard on pushing Italy out of the European Union, and by the end of 2020, the nation voted to leave. She secretly formed a political party in Italy called SPQR, which grew exponentially with the help of the resources from the Strix Corporation and the unrest created by the legion’s anti-social engineering. At the start of the new decade, there was a general feeling in the air that something was about to change in the world.

SPQR won the general election in Italy in 2023. At this time, there was a second revolution in Iran, instigated by the legion. The new government was inspired by the so-called Neo-Ancient Movement in Italy and applied similar rhetoric but with regard to the Persian empire. A man named James Khavari became the first emperor of Persia in more than two thousand years. He allied with Italy and the Russian Federation and thus created tensions that hadn’t been felt since the Cold War.

Julia took the title of Roman Empress in 2030. The very next day, the Catholic Church was declared a pedophile ring, which was possible after years of actual cases and exaggerated propaganda. During a great ceremony, the Pope was arrested and forced to hand over his authority and all of the Church properties to the SPQR.

This decision made sense, even though the reasoning behind the arrest was a bit disingenuous, because there couldn’t be two emperors within the borders of Rome. The legion, once nothing more than a bunch of kids, joined the growing movement and became the first legion in the new Roman army.

Tensions reached their boiling point in 2045. James Khavari allowed the Russians to place nuclear missiles on the border of Iran, forcing the US to counteract. No one really knew what set it off, if it was planned or an accident, but on the 27th of January that year, Tehran was engulfed in a light a thousand times brighter than the sun, and a few hours later, Jerusalem was reduced to rubble. There was so much confusion during these hours. Usually, when something big happened in the world, there were people recording it with their devices, but this time was different. There was silence for the first time in a long time and simply lost contact. What followed was the footage of mushroom clouds, and the silence was replaced by a global outcry of anguish.

You ran into Julia’s chamber. She was in a meeting with one of her greatest engineers—Elonius—and they were both looking at her huge world map. The golden laurel wreath glimmered on her head as if she was partaking in a ceremony. There was even a butler in the room holding a silver tray with a wine glass on it. But when you entered, all of their attention was on you.

“Benius,” she said when she saw you, “it has finally happened! After all these years, the docile and degenerate western civilization is falling. The barbarians are eradicated once and for all! Can you imagine? The Senate is being moved to the bunkers as we speak, and I’ll join them shortly together with the imperial guard. I want you to bring two of our legions to Provincia Britannia as soon as possible to make sure the territory is secured after the fallout.”

“Y-you did this?” you asked in disbelief. “This was you?”

“We did it together.” She looked at you as if surprised by your question. “It wouldn’t have been possible without you—”

“I-I didn’t sign up for this,” you said. “Not *this*.” Your lower lip trembled. “The other things: the beatings, the crucifixions… Sure. Those people were evil. We had a *purpose*. That’s what you always said. But this—”    

“There’s no difference.” She walked closer to you. “You know that. This was necessary, Benius. What did you think the hymn of the legion was about? It was about this moment. It has always been about this! My sister was raped twice. Once by a group of thugs, and then again by the society who let them get away with it. And now, just like Los Bárbaros, Western civilization will be destroyed.”

You felt her words like an iron fist. A long moment of silence followed. You couldn’t believe what was happening. The woman you once thought was so kind and wise had just destroyed half the world. What kind of person could do something like that?

“But my dad—” you whispered. “He’s still in Stockholm.”

You hadn’t seen your dad since you moved to Italy, but you had planned to visit him over Christmas. A Christmas that was never going to happen now.

“I’m sorry,” Julia said, “but there’s nothing we can do about that. The decision has been made. Besides, nuclear war can’t be planned precisely enough to know exactly when it’s going to happen. It’s almost like giving birth.” She stopped as if to admire her own phrasing. “The world is changing, Benius, and we have to change with it.” She embraced you, and as your body tensed up, she whispered in your ear: “Our love has finally conquered the world.”

Your life had been turned upside down in the span of a day. All the luxuries and comforts you had grown accustomed to were gone in an instant, replaced by the harsh reality of a nuclear winter. You rushed out of the room, grabbed a phone, and desperately tried to call your dad, but there was no answer. In the end, you learned that Stockholm had been hit by one of the first bombs. And you never heard from your dad again.

The post-nuclear conquest of Britain was easy. You spent over two years in the rubble of London. Julia was content, happier than you had ever seen her before. But this was too big of a sacrifice for you. Again, I know it will be difficult to understand this from where you are standing right now. You have just discovered love. Your childhood dream of finally being loved has come true. But, please, believe me… You’re only occupying a small part of Julia’s mind. She’s already, while you’re reading this message, seeing the crucifixions; she’s already seeing the missiles cross the oceans… already seeing the laurel wreath around her beautiful head. If you read her diary, you’ll see that I’m telling you the truth.

At the end of eighth grade, she’ll bring you up on the roof of the school. There, watching the city, she’ll tell you that she can see patterns that no one else can see. And she will tell you that a great decline is coming, a great stagnation, and what she calls a boring dystopia followed by an end with no subsequent beginning. She will joke, “Someone should turn it off and on again.” That’s your cue. That’s your only chance to change the course of history and save civilization. No one will be looking. You have to push her. As I said before, I know how unimaginably difficult this will be for you. I know this… because I’m you, Benjamin.

But however happy Julia made me, it’s not worth the death of billions. It’s not worth the death of my father. I trust you’ll believe me after seeing the pictures, and that you’ll do the right thing. Mankind depends on it.

I’ve attached a formula that you should be able to make using ordinary medicine and some equipment from the chemistry lab at school. If you consume it on the same day as the murder, you’ll forget most of that year including the act itself. I can only hope that it will help you live a normal life after your heroic deed.

I cried at the end of the letter. This was the missing piece of the puzzle, the reason I had felt so confused about what happened all my life. I had doomed myself to save a doomed world. The following year, I moved to London. I wouldn’t have written this if it weren’t for the fact that I already succeeded. I’ve infiltrated the Leif Andersson Institute. And tomorrow I’ll send a new e-mail back to 1998, telling myself not to listen to the first one.

I’ll save her, and I’ll save the life we were supposed to have together. I don’t know if the timeline will change in an instant, or if it will happen gradually, but it *will* happen. My misery will finally be over. And Julia shall live [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/tobiasmalm/comments/112r4le/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another/).
