I don’t remember the last time I heard my own voice. I think I stopped speaking when I realized no one was listening. When I realized no one even could listen.

But tonight, I break the silence.

Because I’m done living like this.

I’ve spent too long locked inside these walls, pretending that if I don’t acknowledge it, it won’t take anything else from me. But ignoring it hasn’t stopped the smell. It hasn’t stopped the weight in the air, pressing down on me like I’m being buried alive.

And it hasn’t stopped the sound.

The slow, deliberate scraping along my walls. The click of shifting joints just outside my bedroom door.

It’s been getting closer.

I know what that means.

I’m running out of time.

I don’t know if this thing is a curse, a being, or something worse. But I know one thing—it's tied to acknowledgment.

So what happens if I do the opposite?

What if I trap it in a place where nothing can acknowledge it?

I don’t have much to work with, but I have my basement. I have chains. And I have a blindfold.

If I can force it into a confined space, if I can lock it away, then maybe—just maybe—I can sever whatever connection it has to me.

Or maybe I’ll just be the next body found with my eyes removed and my mouth stretched into a scream.

Either way, I’d rather die fighting than rot away in this house.

The smell is unbearable as I step into the basement.

The candles I lit flicker violently, as if something unseen is exhaling against the flames.

I clutch the chains in one hand, my grandfather’s hunting knife in the other. My blindfold is already tied tightly around my eyes.

“Come on,” I whisper. “You’ve been waiting for this, haven’t you?”

A sound.

Not footsteps. Something worse.

The wet, slithering scrape of burned flesh against concrete. The whisper of something shifting in a body that shouldn’t be moving at all.

It’s here.

My grip tightens. My whole body screams at me to run, but I force myself to stand my ground.

“I see you,” I lie.

A breath—sharp, rattling.

It reacts.

For the first time, it reacts.

It moves fast. Faster than I expected.

Cold air rushes past me as it lunges. A presence so heavy it feels like a storm is pressing against my chest.

I swing the chains wildly, and for a moment—just a moment—I feel resistance.

A hit.

A noise.

Like a wet, broken wheeze.

I don’t hesitate. I move. Wrapping the chains around whatever I can, pulling tight.

Its form shifts beneath my grip. It’s not solid. Not fully. It writhes like something caught between shapes. But it’s there. It’s real enough.

The smell is suffocating. I gag, but I don’t let go.

It thrashes. The walls shake. The candles snuff out.

Then—

Silence.

Complete, unnatural silence.

I don’t know how long I stay there, blindfolded, gripping the chains.

But eventually, I realize something.

The air is lighter. The pressure is gone.

I don’t feel its eyes on me anymore.

I don’t feel anything at all.

I let go.

The chains clatter to the ground. I step back, breath shaking, and wait for the sound of movement.

Nothing.

Slowly, I reach up and pull the blindfold off.

The basement is empty.

The chains lay in a heap on the floor. The room looks… normal. Dusty, untouched.

Like nothing ever happened.

I climb the stairs, one step at a time, half-expecting the weight to return. The smell. The feeling.

But there’s nothing.

The house is quiet.

For the first time in years, I am alone.

The next morning, I step outside. The sun is brighter than I remember. The sky wider. The world real in a way it hasn’t felt in so long.

I take a deep breath—clean air, no rot, no burning hair.

I laugh. I actually laugh.

And then—

I see him.

Standing at the tree line.

Not the thing.

A man.

Staring at me, unmoving.

His skin looks pale. Almost waxy. His eyes hollow, but watching.

Something about him feels… off.

Like I used to feel.

And then I understand.

The feeling didn’t disappear.

It just moved on.

The man turns and walks away. Vanishing into the woods.

I don’t chase him.

I don’t call out.

Because I know the rules now.

I know what he has to do.

And I know—

Whatever happens next, I won’t be a part of it.

For the first time in years… I can finally rest.
