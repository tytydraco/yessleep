I will take my first life tonight. Well, my first human life. I’ve been practicing on animals, which is something I hear serial killers do. They also get concussions at a young age, apparently, but it’s a little late for that.

I don’t want to do this. I want to be home behind a thousand locked doors with my rottweiler Zeus and a loaded gun. That’s where I feel the best and can get some unmedicated rest. But I have a goal, and my therapist says that creating and achieving goals can help me regain my sense of self, the ownership of my body and mind. I hope she’s right, it would be a shame if the old woman in the back of my car dies for nothing tonight. My goal isn’t just to murder somebody, not something boring like that. My goal is to get a murder I committed on this podcast I can’t stop listening to. 

My sister says it's not good for my mind to listen to it, but I just can’t turn it off. Even now in the dead of night, rain pounding on the windows as my car snakes up the winding road of these woods, my finger itches for my phone, and I press play on the latest episode, a woman’s cheery voice filling the car, covering the thick snores of the old woman curled up in the back. 

“Hello, hello True Crime Cuties! It’s Becka!” 
 
“And Lauryn!”

“And we’re the cuties interested in bled out beauties, serial killer booties, and no we don’t have cooties!” They said in unison. I mouthed along as they did, a small smile on my lips.

“Okay, by popular request, we are continuing our series on Simon Lawrence, aka “The Tailor” and his victims, particularly the only surviving victim, Jenna Fields.”

“Gosh, this is part, what, 13, 14?”

“No, it’s crazy, Lauryn, this is literally part 15! Can you believe it? I mean, have you ever been so obsessed with a case as we are with this one?” Becka asked.

“That is actually insane, wow. No, I don’t think we have ever covered anything like this, but to be fair, there is so much to talk about. Plus, sue me, cancel me, or whatever, but the killer is hot and I’m not sorry about it.” The hosts laughed. 

“No, but he is, though. And he’s like, creative about how he did what he did, you know? Like, obviously not condoning his actions, but we have covered so many boring cases where the guy sexually assaults and murders the girl or kid or whatever and then dumps the body, and those are okay, but a little spice is needed, you know? Simon brings that spice, that little extra something. Lauryn, would you be a dear, and tell people who maybe need a refresher on parts 1-14, just why we call him “The Tailor?” 

“Of course, so Simon Lawrence, a handsome surgeon with a dark side, abducts 18-year-old Jenna Fields, who was a high school senior. Important note about Jenna is that at the time of her kidnapping, this girl had such long hair cause she was growing it out to donate for cancer patients. You know what they say: no good deed goes unpunished. So, this long hair draws Simon to Jenna.” Lauryn explains. 

“Yeah, that makes sense, because as we discussed, Jenna’s not exactly a looker.” 
“Oh my god, Becka, she’s gonna send letters again, stop!” Lauryn laughed. My grip tightened on the wheel.

“Totally joking. Anyway, yeah, it turned out Simon is very into making things out of human skin and hair. So he sees Jenna and is like “Oh my god, I can get a couple rugs out of this girl.” Becka snorts, and they both laugh again. I almost laugh, too. 

“So, for 3 years Jenna is held captive by Simon. He makes stuff out of her hair, some of her teeth, and he also takes a panel of skin to add to his skin quilt!” Lauryn says excitedly. 

“Yes, you heard that right, skin quilt. Jenna is not Simon’s first victim, he has taken panels of skin from others for this, I mean, it’s like a king-sized blanket. But Jenna is different. Again, we are not sure what he saw in her, but he saw something and kept her alive. Even going as far as to make love to her underneath the skin quilt.”

“Yeah, actually insane, imagine being held captive, and a man is making love to you underneath a human flesh skin quilt, that has your skin in it. Real quick, I’d like to thank our sponsor “Naughty Nutrients,” the fast and easy meal kit delivery service that-”

I muted the podcast. We were here.

I pulled the car beside the abandoned mill. I had already scouted the area, the nearest house was 16.2 miles away. The storm was a nice surprise, the thunder would do wonders to cover up the noise. What I did tonight had to be memorable; it had to be shocking and disgusting enough to get on the show. When I spoke to Becka weeks ago, that’s what she told me: if I wanted them to stop talking about Simon, then they needed a new story to cover that was even better, more gruesome. Apparently, their listeners had gone up substantially since they started covering the case. They were even gonna release merch when they got to part 20. I started by bringing my supplies into the mill: rope, a bone saw, rubber ducks, a drill, a tarp, a jar of pennies, a mallet, roller skates, grape jelly, sandpaper, and a funnel cake. I was ready. 

Finally, I went back out to the car and woke the old woman.

“Becka?” She yawned. My heart swelled. 

Becka had mentioned that her mom was suffering from Alzheimer's a couple of times on the show. 

“No, but I’m a friend of your daughter. I’m Jenna. Come with me.”
