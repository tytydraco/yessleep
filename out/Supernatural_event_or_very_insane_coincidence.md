Hey! First ever post here.

I am about to tell you a weird thing that happened to my dad. This is a short one, but actually very scary when you think about the events. It always makes me ask myself how this could be a simple coincidence. Before I begin, I want to clarify some stuff you may ask or think, as I did too when he told me that story:

- First of all, my dad is very rational. This means that even though this really weird thing happened to him, he still claims the coincidence being the cause of it, not supernatural events.
- Secondly, I do not believe in supernatural too. I trust what I see, and yet nothing happened to me. I am not trying to make you believe into stuff, but just sharing his story with you all!
- Lastly, I know my dad really, really well. He does not lie, he does not prank. You can always trust what he says about things like this, there are no doubts about it. I know it can be hard for you guys, but I can assure you this is not BS. Supernatural stuff or coincidence, this happened.


During this story, we will call my grandma Michele Seris.


This story takes place in Belgium somewhere between 1992 and 1994 in the month of December. By the time, my dad was around 18/21 years old, studying at the university and living with my grandparents. They had (and still have!) a big house in the countryside, not too far from Brussels. I’ve been there countless of times, I know that house really well and is funny to me how I could then visualize the spaces while he told me that story. Anyway, the thing is that nobody was there exept him. My grandparents were having a trip, and my dad was in a study period. We call this a « blocus » here, this is a period when you are supposed to have hollidays, but you need to study pretty much all day to succeed your incoming exams.

My dad was supposed to keep the house for a week and a half. He had his routine, walking up at 8:30AM, studying all day and getting into bed around 10:30PM. 4 days in, nothing special happened. Just him and the silence of the nature, I mean it is not a busy neighborhood at all, it always surprises me how quiet is the house and its surroundings. It is a very good place to stay when you need to focus on your studying, day and night.

The 5th morning around 6AM, still full night outside, my grandma’s alarm started ringing. My dad woke up, got out of his bed and made it to the room where he wondered how this alarm could be ringing, knowing there was no « per day programation » system. This just means that you cannot program an alarm to ring at 7AM only monday for example. It is an everyday alarm you turn on going to bed, but no one could have turned it on the evening before.

My dad turned off the alarm and want back to bed.

He woke up and did as usual. Worked, worked and worked, until a call on the landline shattered the silence.

« Hi, am I talking to Michele Seris? »

« No, she is not here, you are talking to his son »

« Okay, sorry for disturbing. Are you over 18? »

« Yes, why? »

« We just wanna inform you that your grandma passed away at the hospital this morning around 6AM »


This is actually insane. I wanna believe to a coincidence, but I mean this is quite hard to swallow. Even my dad thinks this is a coincidence, and I think this shows how he is not bragging about a supernatural event or so, adding a significent amount of credibility to his story in my opinion.

Quite interesting huh?
Hope you like it!
