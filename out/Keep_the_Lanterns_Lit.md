 

Katoka, it’s your average small town out in the middle of nowhere Virginia. Except for one thing. Our town’s surrounded by lanterns that have to be lit every night. Pretty weird right? As far as I know, this has been going on ever since the town’s founding back in 1872. 30 lanterns spaced around the town's perimeter that had to be lit every day before sundown. 

Well, last night they all went out.

Rumors spread fast in a small town. Everyone and their dog had an opinion on what happens when they go out. These rumors all stemmed from an incident that happened when I was eight years old. One night right as the sun set there was a small earthquake then nine of the lanterns went out. The next day 17 people were missing. Their cases were swept under the rug just like every other time. There are people who know what happens but I guess they just keep it to themselves.  

The town has a warning system that alerts the town if a lantern goes out. Since then we’ve only ever had one or two go out at a time that I know of. Every time it’s had the same conclusion. We would get the warning and lock our home down the best we could. Then the next day pray that everyone was still here. Sometimes that would be true, but most of the time the town’s population would shrink by one or two.

After graduating from my town's small high school I went off to college which was about two hours away. Everything was going great and honestly, I was glad to be away. Fast forward to my second year and I wasn’t doing very hot. Poor time management and all around laziness cost me my scholarship that was getting me by. I was low on funds and summer was coming up so I decided to move back home to try and save enough to pay for next year's classes. 

My mood had started to change and I was actually enjoying spending time with my family who was happy to see me. I didn’t have the nerve to tell them about my misfortunes in school. I would cross that bridge when I came to it. My uncle runs a restaurant in town and gave me a job that helped me get back on my feet. My free time was spent reading or going on hikes throughout the forests. It helped put my mind at ease, it felt like one of the only places I could truly relax.

Every aspect of the town was ideal. Everyone was nice and always greeted with a smile. There was pretty much no crime except for petty things like graffiti and teenagers sneaking off into abandoned homes to get drunk. The only reason we had such a large police force was because of the lanterns. There were special teams that went out heavily armed every night to patrol the perimeter to make sure the lanterns stayed lit. I don’t even know if you could call them police.  The amount of gear they had was more akin to a soldier. I was positive they knew what was happening to our town.

I asked someone on one of the teams when I was younger. He was my neighbor Mr. Douglass. He was a scary-looking man but he was always nice to me and my sister. One day I worked up the courage to ask him. I quickly realized my mistake when he got a very serious look on his face and told me to never ask him that again. He said I was too young to be worrying about that kind of thing. He apologized the next day profusely for getting so angry. It’s safe to say I never asked that question again. Mr. Douglass went missing one night when two lanterns went out while he was on a patrol. I was in 11th grade at the time.

My friend Evan from school lived close to where the lanterns went out. His family was sheltering in his basement after getting the alert when he heard a vehicle skid to a halt and people get out. He said that silenced gunshots rang out through the night air followed by screams from the police. A few minutes later he saw a bright flash and heard the van crank up and ride out even faster than it arrived. I later learned that it wasn’t only Mr. Douglass who disappeared that night but also one other person from his group. The van sped away because four of the surviving people from the team were injured and needed to be treated at the hospital. 

Another time my family had just finished dinner when we got the alert. This time, it was a special warning, meaning that a lantern has gone out close to your home. We made it through the night unscathed, but I remember it was around 2 am we were all huddled in the living room and I swear I heard laughing. It wasn’t your normal laughter, it sounded twisted, almost maniacal.  Followed by screams from who I later learned was Ms. Weaver, a widow from down the street. Her screams still haunt my dreams to this day.

I tried to talk to my parents about it the next day but they wouldn’t give me an answer. Asking my father about the laughter caused him to yell at me and send me to my room. He said as long as we stay quiet and indoors nothing bad would happen. I don’t know if he just wouldn’t tell me because he still thought I was a kid or what but I definitely got the vibe that he knew something and didn’t want to tell me. 

One more thing before I tell you about the events that unfolded yesterday. The lanterns. I come across them every so often while out on some of my hikes. They look more like a tiki torch you would see at a luau. At least that's what I think. A metal pole that’s covered with foreign markings that look similar to Egyptian hieroglyphs. I’ve tried to no avail to find what language it is. Then you have the light source. It's a cylinder that is encased in glass to protect the flame from the elements. There is a small metal latch that opens so the torch can be ignited. One of the strangest things is that the lantern's flame is purple. I’ve never seen anything like it.

I often questioned my parents why we stayed in this town. Sure we weren’t rich by any means but I know we could afford to relocate. Most of the time I was just brushed off but one night after my dad had one too many drinks he told me. 

“We stay to protect this place and the people outside of it. You’ll understand someday when you’re old enough,” he told me through slurred words. 

Very cryptic I know. I was sent off to bed after that by my mother. I often wondered what he meant by protecting this place. Wouldn’t it just be in everyone's best interest to just leave?  Get away from here so we didn’t have to go to sleep wondering if we would be taken next. What did I know anyway? After all, everyone thinks I’m just a kid.

So yeah, that’s a little introduction and backstory for Katoka. I just wanted to give you an idea of my interesting childhood town. If it didn’t have its issues it would be a picture perfect town. Sadly, lanterns that ward off evil are the kind of thing that takes that away.

So, now let me tell you what happened yesterday. The day started off like any other, I got up, made a quick breakfast, and headed out the door for work. Work was slow, I guess everyone was eating at home today. The regulars came in like Mr. Joshua and his wife and I enjoyed talking to them for a while to pass the time. 

It had finally gotten time to close up at 5 pm. Not to pat myself on the back or anything, but you would be amazed if you saw the speed I can close up shop. I said my farewell to my uncle and hopped on my bike to head home for the day. 

It’s always strange driving home in the evening and seeing everyone hurriedly closing up their business. None stay open after the sun sets. The only things that operate are emergency services and our town's surprisingly large hospital. I waved as I rode by Ms. Susan who ran a bakery a few blocks away from the restaurant. She use to always give me free treats when I was younger. She is a kind older woman who’s always smiling.

I made it home putting my bike up in the garage. Got through the door and was met with the smell of my mom’s amazing cooking. I think she could give uncle Brian a run for his money. Tonight we were having spaghetti. After the feast, I was in the living room with my sister and father watching tv. My mom was cleaning up after the meal. That’s when it happened.

The house began to shake and a few moments later a loud boom was heard. I stood up trying to keep my balance while my father grabbed hold of the bookshelf that was threatening to fall on my sister. My little sister was crying calling out for her parents. My dad reached and grabbed her picking her up. The power flashed a few times then went out completely. The shaking stopped after about 20 seconds and my mom made her way out from under the dining room table.

After my dad calmed my sister down he began making phone calls. He tried the emergency service number but it was busy. My mom was on the phone talking to who I assume was our neighbors asking if they were okay. I heard my dad begin talking to someone who I soon learned was Mr. Mathers, he was a deputy. I guess he had his personal number.

“What, how did that happen?” my father basically shouted into his phone. 

“Are you sure? Oh god. I gotta make some calls, thanks for telling me Mathers. Be safe.”

My dad clicked the end call button and began scrolling frantically through his contacts lists. 

“What’s happening honey,” my mom asked with a concerned look.

“Listen, you and the kids start closing up and locking every window and door in the house. I'll explain in a minute just please do it right now,” he looked at my mother sternly and I could tell he was shaken.

“You heard your father, let’s go.”

There were so many questions that I wanted to ask him at the time, but one look at him told me that this was serious. There was no doubt in my mind that it had something to do with the lanterns. I would find out in a minute that my assumptions were unfortunately correct. We were all running through the house like rats in a maze shutting and locking everything. My mother grabbed all the extra sheets from the closet and began hanging them over the windows. After finishing we all returned to the living room. 

I looked to my father, “Dad, what’s going on?”

He looked at me and began to speak. That’s when all of our phones buzzed. 

**SPECIAL ALERT**

**Seismic activity has been reported from the North, South, East, and West sections of Katoka. Our police special teams have been dispatched to investigate. At this moment we have recorded 12 lanterns that are no longer lit but that number is likely higher. We highly encourage everyone to barricade your homes and shelter in a secure room that is furthest from the outside. If you see or hear anything call the emergency hotline right away.** 

“Oh god,” my mother said while hugging my sister tight.

The next half an hour was spent moving everything we needed upstairs into my sister's bedroom which we chose as it only had one window as an access point. Every so often the silence would be broken by what sounded like gunshots off in the distance. I would also see bright flashes of light off in the distance that seemed to reach out for the clouds above. I remembered what Evan told me and wondered if that was what he had seen. After sitting down in silence for a few minutes just listening and peeking outside my father finally spoke.

“Hun, would you and your sister mind stepping out into the hall for a moment? I’ve got some things to tell Tyler,” my dad asked my mom and she nodded. They both exited the room.

“Listen Tyler, I know I don’t tell you much about what goes on in this town, but it’s because I wanted to keep you away from all this. Now though, there are some things you need to understand.”

I shook my head listening intently.

“There have been worse incidents than the one that happened 8 years ago,” he paused, “This town has been plagued by those things since its founding. Your relatives have been here protecting this place since the start. I don’t do much anymore, but I use to help out with the police department when I was younger. Before you were born I would go out almost every night and try to keep the town safe.”

I was trying to process all of the information my dad was telling me. I never knew he worked for the police or that my family had been in this town for so long. The questions were piling up in my head but I found some that took precedence. 

“So, what were you protecting us from? What happens when the lanterns go out?”

“There are only rumors about the lanterns that I've heard. They didn't tell us much, only that they were our best protection against them. I heard that around the time the town was founded they started to be targeted by them and a local priest created the lanterns. No one knows how he did it. Divine intervention I suppose.”

“What do they protect us from?”

“The people before us called them the Trobus. I can’t tell you where they come from. My best guess is either hell or some other world. Cracks form in the ground some nights and they are what crawl out. The lanterns help ward off whatever they do to get here but sometimes it’s too strong and the lanterns go out.”

“So, why don’t we just leave? Why does the town have to stay here?”

“Because if we go they will get out. Without the lanterns to keep them at bay, they would flood in and spread farther than the reaches of Katoka. That’s why we stay here, to make sure that never happens.”

It was all making more sense now in my head. Everyone in this town feels obligated to help in some way to help protect not only the town but everyone outside of it too. At least the people that know what’s happening. 

“Ohh, and one more thing Tyler,” my dad said grabbing a case he brought upstairs with him, “If those things get in the house use this.”

He opened the case which had three round balls that looked like hand grenades.

“Umm, I don’t think we should have bombs in the house dad.”

“Listen these don’t explode, you push the button at the top and it releases a bright flash. The Trobus hate light so if you get in a bind they will buy you a few seconds. Normally the streetlights keep them away, but now that they’re out these things will have free reign.”

My mind was reeling but I was also very grateful that my dad was confident enough to finally tell me. He called for my mom and my sister to come back in and we all continued idle chit chat trying to distract ourselves. Shots were ringing off in the distance but I could tell some of them were getting closer. Every so often my dad would glance out between the sheet on the window to glance at the street below. 

Our silence was cut when an armored police van drove onto our street. I looked out and noticed they were setting up a perimeter. Some stayed around the van propped up on the ajar doors while others took point behind my neighbor's cars. They were all aiming in the same direction.

That’s when we heard it. Laughter. It was so quiet at first I didn’t know what I was hearing. I looked over at my father who was staring intently at the police who had their rifles pointed in the direction of the sound.

“What’s that daddy?” my sister Katie asked.

“It’s nothing sweetie, the police are going to keep us safe. Don’t you worry.”

I glanced at my father and whispered so my sister wouldn’t hear, “Is it a Trobus?”

He nodded and I felt a lump begin to form in my throat. My father tightened his grip on the rifle he grabbed from the closet. He handed me a handgun that he had taken me out a few times to shoot. The laughter was getting louder at this point and it sounded like more than one.

“You remember how to use this right?” my father said rhetorically and I nodded.

“Daddy I’m scared,” Katie let out with a whimper.

“I know sweetie you and your mom just stay over there. The police will handle it. Remember if nothing else your brother and I will keep you safe,” he turned with a smile to face my sister.

That seemed to calm her down. We sat listening as the laughter grew louder and louder. Then I saw one, a Trobus. It was pitch black in color with long appendages. It was no wider than a person, but it stood at least 12 feet. Two long arms reached all the way to the ground being dragged lazily along. Its head was disproportionately large compared to the rest of it with a mouth that stretched ear to ear. Its eyes were two yellow saucers that seems to glow in the moonlight.

“Targets sighted! Open fire!”

Sorry for cutting it short but that’s all I can type out for today. I just got word that my dad has woken up from surgery. I’ll explain more when I get the chance. The next part will be posted when I get the chance. There is a lot going on in our town right now so I don’t know when that will be but I will try my best to keep you all updated and finish my story.
