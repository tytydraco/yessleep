***It was 2 AM. I realized that my sleep was over when someone was already the third time calling me on my phone. Sleepy, I got up, rubbed my eyes, and saw, that my friend "Michael" was calling me. Understandably, I was angry. But I decided, because it was my friend that I need to pick up the phone As I picked up, he said this:***   


  
***"Ayo, so I have a problem... My car stalled near the forest on the outskirts of the city.. can you pick me up, please. I'll send the coordinates."***   
***I swear, in his voice, something was.. a little bit strange. I thought it was because of stress that his car was stalled.. actually, how did he get there?***    
***I looked at my phone, as he sent the coordinates. It was 70km away from the city. Before I even asked something he got offline and didn't answer the calls.***   
***Even though it was a long way there, I decided to drive there. My worst error.***  


  
***I put on the jacket, opened the front door of my house, passed the garden, closed the door, and sat in my Chevrolet. As I started the car, I saw that nobody was driving that night time. After I left the city I saw a black figure, that quickly disappeared into the forest. As I came closer, I saw my friend's old BMW. I opened the doors of my Chevrolet and knocked on Michael's car's left window. I saw him, sitting in his car. The first time he ignored me and then turned to me.***   
***He silently left his car, slowly coming to me. As I saw, his car was in minimum damage from the accident. He didn't even try to start it when I drive. As he came to me, he said "thanks" and sat in my car. He didn't answer most questions, and when I asked about how he got there he answered "I was going to my grandma." Perhaps he was sleepy... As I started the car, we move forward but the road was the same even though we moved.***    
***Then I saw this - I saw another BMW, the same one that my friend has. As I looked into Michael's eyes, I left the car and I came to the same BMW car. This BMW was extremely damaged, and I saw the body of Michael...***   


  
***Then who is the one I picked up? I was feared to turn around and even got paralyzed because of that situation. As I turn around I saw Michael standing near my car. In a matter of seconds, his skin starts to get off like a costume. I stand paralyzed for some seconds but when his skin lay on the road, I saw the true one - tall, like my friend's body, sharp claws and jar with long sharp teeth. His eyes were pure white and he ran at me, soonly after he would scream that my ears were hurt. I run and hide behind Michael's BMW. It was all dark, only the headlamp of my car lighted the bumper of the BMW.***   
***Then I heard noises behind me. As I turned, the monster was already 10m back from me. As I looked into his eyes he ran at me. I had no other choices as I run forward, soonly after hopping into my car and trying to start it. I lost track of the monster and turned off the headlights and light in the car and hide in the back seats. Soonly after, my eyes used to darkness and I saw the monster, standing near my car. Then, I saw Mercedes driving near the road as its doors would open. As the men left, Monster attacked the men, ripping his internal organs on the road. as the blood would spill everywhere. I used this to run away. I started my car successfully, and at full speed, I'd drive on the road, so only after losing track of the monster. So only after, I would drive into a village... I was surprised, and my calmness ended when I looked back. The monster was already in the back of my car. Then the car stalled. On the windows of the car, I would see shadows. Then, the monster broke the frontal window and plunged his claws into my shoulder. I shouted, as my warm blood would be spilled everywhere. I already thought that my life was over, but then I would see the sunrise.***   


  
***As the sun set, everything disappeared. I fell on the road, exhausted and having no powers whatsoever. I was happy, that monster didn't rip my organs, but soonly, I saw a car. Then, I don't remember anything, but I woke up at the hospital, with the bandage on my shoulder. I didn't say a word. Then, I woke up and the doctors told me that the operation is done.***   
***Continue or not?***
