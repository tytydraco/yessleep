As hard as my job can be, i love it most of the time... when i don't it's just the kids being assholes but hey, i was in their place once so i understand. i've earned myself the nickname "the fun teacher" because of how relaxed i am on the kids, of course i do my job I'm just not overly harsh on the kids.

it was like that for as long as i could remember until another teacher joined our school and to my suprise had a welcoming party?! i never was allowed to have anything like that so obviously i was pretty petty but i just brushed it off... the kids were just having fun, this new teachers cool. i thought this to myself, just a little bit jealous until i forgot completely.

afterwards, i saw everyone talking about how. "theres a even better teacher" and "this teacher hosts us partys after every test if we do well and we watch movies after we finish our work." obviously she said she'd host partys after every test herself because currently, no tests were happening. 

you might ask me why i care so much, I've just grown to love my job and title and i couldn't help but envy them.

i was obviously a higher rank then them so i, and I'm not very proud of this... i used my power to push that teacher around in hopes they got fed up of antics and just left already. i did this to fuel my ego and get rid of the deep insecurities i had.

day after day, this only got worse and i didn't know what to do anymore...

in my entire teaching career I've accomplished many things but theres one thing I've been after; the teacher of the year award. it'll be so accomplishing to be called "the best teacher" theres just one thing, it's down to a vote and for awhile now i thought i couldn't possibly get any competition... but i was wrong.

i got harsher and grumpier and as a result i made everyone dislike me which made me dislike myself. i sigh, staring at the ceiling.

"Friday December the 20th" thats when the award would be given during the big christmas assembly the school has each year. i forgot about it for a little while until...

one day, to my horror the teacher died during lunchtime very suddenly everyone was panicking and freaking out, they just dropped to the ground lifeless and that was that... i instantly regretted treating them like shit and i knew it'd haunt me. i do some quick prayers hoping they forgive me for my toxic behavior fueled by pure jealously. i go home early, i yawn... god I'm tired. as i go to sleep my restless dreams are filled with that face i knew so well, i knew I'd be haunted for this... I'll do everything to get forgiveness, somehow. these nightmares continued every single day, i tried therapy and nothing seemed to work.

how could they just die like that?! this can't be random, surely...

even though her death had nothing to do with me i still feel partially responsible, how was i meant to live with myself after being awful to a person who was now dead? i never even said sorry, once. so i found myself praying again desperately begging for their forgiveness. i decided from now on to avoid the nightmares I'd sleep for less time, a good coffee always helped but in the lingering silence I found my mind always wandering back to them and i was starting to be sure that there was no escape from the torment.

at some point i considered joining them so i could apologize but i stopped immediately after realizing they could rip me apart when they saw me again for how badly i treated them. that thought alone, kept me alive to constantly and never endingly think about the same topic. i distracted myself and thought of other things but it always wandered back, somehow.

a few months later i managed to get help that worked, i decide to return to work and everything's normal. i check the date "December the 20th" it was today, i cross my fingers and enter the hall. i dressed my best for the situation, here i am now. 

i walk up to the stage with a grin on my face, giving a speech on how the one lingering in my mind ever since it happened was a great person who was taken far too soon, as do the other teachers. i sit down on a chair to the side 

"we're announcing the teacher of the year award now."

i cross my fingers.

please.

please.

please.


the principle calls out my name and I'm overjoyed! i stand up and accept my award with a smile, i worked so, so hard for this very moment and now i can finally live in it! "thank you students and teachers alike for treating me with respect most of the time to you student..." i say the last part in a way they know I'm joking. "these past few months have been... difficult to say the least but thanks to you all I'm standing up here today."

when my speech finishes i must've got into it because i hadn't realized I'd closed my eyes... when i open them, the buildings dark... nobodys there. my heart sinks... i pace around the stage, I'm still holding onto the award. 

i realize something so suddenly, something i thought i burried at the back of my mind and forgot about.

just then do i notice it's not a statue I'm holding, it's the bottle of poison i used to kill my competition with.
