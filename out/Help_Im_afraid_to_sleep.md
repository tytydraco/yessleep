I would like to seek your advice regarding a problem I’ve been having for a few years now.

How many of you here find yourselves going to sleep only to suddenly open your eyes, unable to move and scared that you might conjure up something or even find yourself dreaming and being aware that it is a dream and still not able to wake yourself up?

I was in high school when I first experienced sleep paralysis. I remember it vividly, I was awake and could see the night lamp illuminating the whole room with orange light, hearing my mother flip pages from her book as we shared the same room at the time. It’s been a few years since I started experiencing sleep paralysis although it doesn’t happen to me often. 

I often have these dreams where I find myself waking up from a dream thinking I am finally awake only to find myself waking up again. Sometimes it happens so many times in a loop.

I just had another sleep paralysis tonight. I work in the night and I often sleep from noon to about 8pm which is an hour before my work starts since I work from home. I woke up at around 5pm from some noise outside my room and feel back asleep around 7 o’clock. I woke up again on my side unable to move and had a heavy feeling I was no longer alone in my locked room. I wanted to wake up and be able to move because I wanted to check the time because I didn’t want to be late for work. 

It took a while for me to be able to wake up from that sleep paralysis, it involved me praying as I was terrified of the presence I was feeling. When I finally woke up, I checked my phone and found that it was 9:16pm. I’m 16 minutes late from work and I cursed myself getting up and sitting at my swivel chair and immediately opening up my work laptop. Although something felt wrong, I wasn’t able to log in correctly and after a few failed attempts I finally glanced down the illuminated keyboard and noticed a lot of the keys were missing. It was then that I realized I was still dreaming. 

I didn’t know how to wake up from my dream and I did everything that I even tried hurting myself to see if I’d wake up. I felt myself moving and I felt myself hitting but I still couldn’t wake up. 

When I finally woke up, it wasn’t because of anything I did in that dream I just woke up. I contemplated for a few seconds and finally felt relief that I was indeed awake. I then checked my phone and saw it was only 7:46pm. 

I sometimes find myself afraid and wondering what if one day I find myself unable to wake up anymore. I guess I’m just posting this here because I wanted to know if  there are any of you out there that also experiences this. What do you think causes dreams and experiences like this? I think it’s funny that as I was typing this I was yawning a lot and craving for sleep but I’m afraid.

Sorry if my post is a bit long and please excuse any error in grammar as English isn’t my main language.
