[In my last post, I was certain that the curse on my house had been lifted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14ml5ki/i_was_warned_never_to_close_all_doors_in_a_room/) I think I might've jumped the gun on that.  
  
This morning when I went downstairs, I couldn't find the computer that I bought last week. I thought that maybe a burglary had happened while we were in the pocket dimension. I mean, it wouldn't exactly be difficult, considering that the windows and doors are usually left open.  
  
The television was still there, sure, but it probably wouldn't be a burglars main priority. I mean, the thing is nearly twenty years-old. But, looking beside it, I saw my old PlayStation 3. But, I had sold that years ago, around 2015, I think.  
  
I walked to the kitchen and saw that old radio that my mother had thrown out a decade ago. On the counter I found the keys to the car that my father had sold a year before I moved out. Something was very wrong. I was suspicious at that point. I returned into the kitchen, emptied the contents of the fridge onto the floor, then left the room. When I opened the door again, the floor was clean, and the fridge was full again.  
  
It had returned to its original state. As I had remembered it. It was then I put the pieces together.  
  
When my grandmother died, her pocket dimension didn't go away. We didn't even leave it. The spell is now drawing on my childhood memories instead of my grandmother's. The reason her house and more so the world outside it were so distorted is due to her failing memory.  
  
My memories of my childhood house are intact, sure, even some parts of the surrounding forests that I used to play in, so that's why the house isn't constantly shifting and changing like last time. But the spell that caused this whole thing concentrates on memories of the home. The further away from the home, the more distorted the world of the pocket dimension becomes.  
  
And fifteen minutes before, Anya said she was driving to town to buy some groceries...  
  
I rushed to my father's car and sped down the road. After a few minutes of driving, I began to hear the eerie noises from the woods that I had heard upon first entering the pocket dimensions, which I now knew were the cries of the distorted animals deep in the forest. Not long after, the trees began to distort, changing shape, height and color in moments. Finally, after ten minutes of driving, I saw it.  
  
In the distance, my mother's car, which Anya had taken, was being distorted. I stepped out of my car and heard it. Anya was screaming. She was trapped inside the vehicle, and she was being distorted alongside it. I wanted to run over and pull her out of the vehicle, but I knew if I strayed any further, I'd become distorted too. With tears in my eyes, I drove back to the replica of my home and wrote this.  
  
There's not much battery left in my phone. When it dies, so does my connection to the world outside this nightmare. When my grandmother died, this spell, this curse, began drawing on my memories because I was the closest person inside the pocket dimension.  
  
I'm thinking, that if I die, it will transfer to Anya and feed off of her memories instead. She will still be stuck in this hellhole, but from her screams, I'm certain that anything is better than the distortion she suffers now. It's the only solution I can think of, considering Delilah, the one who cast this spell in the first place either got herself killed or gave up trying to end it.  
  
That is why this will be my final update. Goodbye.
