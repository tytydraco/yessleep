I’ve always been afraid of the ocean.

It’s not crippling – I’ve been able to ignore it for most of my life. Sometimes it’s mentioned when phobias come up in conversation, or when a beach visit is suggested by a friend or by a partner. I’ve been lucky enough to grow up in a landlocked county, far from the coastline.

I don’t have the experience of an arachnophobe faced by a many-legged monster, frozen and sweating with terror. It’s more that proximity to the ocean causes a kind of… unease. A feeling that something is wrong, rooted just below my ribs like a pit. It makes me a little jumpy. On edge. Approaching the surf fills me with heavy foreboding, as if to step into the water would be the very end of me.

Wrapped around it is the tiniest feeling that something is missing. That to enter the water, to let the waves wrap around me and drag me down with green hands, is the only way I could ever really be whole. The combination of these feelings has been the root of much confusion in my life – the contradiction of the whole thing.

My parents were silently resigned to my strange behaviour around the sea as a child. We never had a lot of money, and holidays to the beach were not a regular occurrence. Maybe two days spent at the coastline over the summer, my siblings as happy in the sandy water as the tiny skittering crabs, while I stayed back with my mother.

It was on one of these holidays, when I was fifteen years old, that she gave me my first warning.

“You feel it, don’t you?”

She asked me this with a look in her eyes which I had never seen before. Something between sadness and fear. It was not the kind of expression you ever want to see from your mother, and it worried me.

“What?”

“You can feel the sea talking to you.”

I looked out across the ocean. The round dark head of a seal is visible in the distance, gulls swooping above it.

She looked out too, but her gaze was directed towards my father and brothers, splashing in the shallows. “My sister felt it too. That’s how I know. You have the same look on your face when you’re near the water as she always had.” She turned to me, taking my shoulders in her hands and facing me towards her. “Whatever you do, don’t go to the water. I can’t lose someone else.”

At the time, I was confused, and a little annoyed at her lack of an explanation. Eventually, I forgot. Let it fade away, as memories of childhood tend to do.

I never knew my aunt, as she died before I was born. After my recount of the conversation with my mother, you may expect to hear that she drowned – however, she was simply ill. I was never told the exact form of sickness, but I know that she wasted away slowly, fading into death.

I think the loss of her older sister fundamentally changed my mother. My father has told us stories of how she was when they first met, when she was happy and vibrant and overflowing with *life*. By the time I, the third child, was born, she was little but the shell of a mother to us. She acted as a mother should – comforted us, fed us, taught us what we needed to know to live – but if you looked, really looked, then you could tell there was nothing there. Hollow eyes behind a bright smile. When I was younger, and had not known loss, I didn’t understand. Now I have a certain sympathy for her.

This emptiness slowly drove my siblings away. By the time of her death, several years after my fathers, I had become a live-in caregiver for her. As such, I was left to deal with her house and affairs.

It’s a strange thing, the loss of a parent. You can never be ready for it. And just when you feel as if all you want to do is cry, you’re struck with all these terrible responsibilities which now rest on your shoulders. Breaking the news; organising a funeral; dealing with decades of possessions, a life well lived now broken down into boxes of books and childhood toys and clothes and scraps of paper. Jewellery and ornaments and a hundred tiny things which I can never know the sentimentality behind, things which meant the world to her, now sorted into neat piles to sell or throw away or pass on to others. There’s a callousness to it, rummaging through the trappings of her life and searching for value. Something so inherently emotional, broken down to methodology.

As in most houses, the attic was filled with dusty boxes. One of these, when I pulled it down, was labelled with my aunts name. The first physical proof I had ever seen of her existence. The box was heavy and cumbersome, sliding from my fingers, the cardboard misshapen with age and slick with a thick and sticky layer of dust.

The item which fell from the box appeared to be a fur coat. It was slippery, almost like silk. Warm to the touch and much finer than any fur I had ever seen. The pattern was unfamiliar to me, a mottled grey with blooms of silver spreading across it like lichen on a dead branch. The coat stank of old salt and seaweed, like a tidepool on a hot day.

With some trepidation, I realised it must be sealskin.

I’d never seen a sealskin coat before. Briefly, I wondered whether the possession of it was even legal. Why had my mother kept this? Out of everything, why this? She must have gone through her own process – her own methodology – when her beloved sister passed away. And out of everything, she chose to keep this sealskin coat. And not only keep, but lock away. The dust was unmarked, clearly undisturbed for many decades. This coat had not been worn; had not been displayed; had not been cared for, even. As if she did not truly want it, but could not bring herself to get rid of it.

As I ran the fur between my fingers, a scrap of letter-paper fell from the folds. Recognising my mothers neat, sharp handwriting, I picked it up.

*Dearest Maude,*

My aunts name. Was this letter written before or after she died? I carried on reading.

*I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I was so afraid of losing you that I let myself do something terrible, unforgivable, awful. You should never have told me your secret. You should have known that I wouldn’t believe you. I’m sorry I had you involuntarily committed. I’m sorry they didn’t lock you up for longer. I’m sorry I stole your coat. If I hadn’t maybe you would still be here.*

*How was I to know? Who would have ever known? Who would have believed you? I did as any sane person would, Maude. Why didn’t you keep it to yourself?*

*I thought you were in withdrawal. I wasn’t to know it would kill you. Saltwater ran through your veins, Maude, and I didn’t believe you when you told me.*

*I was going to lose you either way. To this or to the draw of the endless ocean. I regret my hand in it, but I do believe it was for the best. I may never be forgiven in the eyes of God, or in my own. But I did what I did for the sake of my children. What if they were like you? What if you made them like you? I can’t let it happen. No child of mine will be marked like you were. No child of mine will be such a cursed creature.*

*I know you told me it was a blessing. But such a thing is unnatural. Who were you to change the ways of the world? The order of things? To change forms like you did is nothing short of the devils work. I tried to fix you, really I did. And when I couldn’t do it, I tried to have the professionals do it instead. But you really were of sound mind, weren’t you? That makes it worse, you know. You knew exactly what you were doing and how wrong it was. But you turned your back on everything right and holy and true and you put all of your faith in that coat.*

*I hope you are happier where you are. I hope you are healthier. I hope that you have been forgiven for what you’ve done, as I pray that I will too, when my time comes.*

*All of my love, always.*

The paper fell from my fingers.

It was nonsensical, clearly. The ravings of a woman stricken by grief. Did my mother truly believe that she had killed her sister by taking this coat from her? Such a thing was absurd.

But as my eyes fell back upon the coat, it appeared to shine in the dim light. Despite the state of the box it had been in, it was unmarked, as clean and new as if it had only just come into existence.

The conversation I had had with my mother on that beach so many years ago suddenly returned to my mind.

“My sister felt it too.”

The coat looked to be my size. The overwhelming urge to try it on crashed over me like a wave on an unresisting shore. But I could feel in my bones that this was not the place for such a thing.

I drove three hours to get to the ocean. The journey is a haze to me, the roads empty at that time of night. Bare feet on the sand, I slipped the coat over my shoulders.

When I awoke again, it was morning. I remembered little of the night before, but my hair was thick with salt, and my heart light with a sense of freedom. Flashes of memories danced through my head – swimming in the clear water, longer and faster than any human could. Rolling and playing with the seals, who welcomed me as one of their own. Feeling more at home than I had ever felt before.

I see now why my mother was so afraid of losing her sister, and of her children taking the same path, if they were to learn about it.

Now that I have felt that freedom, I’m not sure that I can go back.
