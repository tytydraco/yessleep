Rain battered the windows, the downpour relentless, filling the house with the kind of cold that settles deep in your bones.

I liked the attic on days like this. It was quiet up there, tucked away from everything, a space filled with old keepsakes and forgotten things.

But today, I wasn’t just killing time.

Something had been bothering me.

It started last week when I was flipping through one of the old family albums. I wasn’t looking for anything specific—just turning pages, drifting through birthdays, holidays, lazy summer days.

Then I reached the section from when I would have been around four years old.

And froze.

Entire pages were empty.

The photo corners were still there, neatly pressed into the yellowed pages, marking where the pictures used to be. But the photos themselves were gone.

Not shuffled. Not misplaced.

Gone.

At dinner that night, I asked about it, keeping my tone casual.

“Mom, do you know what happened to some of the old photos? The ones from when I was little?”

Her hand froze over her plate.

Just for a second.

Then she smiled—too quick, too bright.

“Oh, those? I probably took them out years ago for a project. Maybe they got lost.”

My father kept eating, silent as usual. But I noticed it—a flicker of something between them. A glance, fast and unreadable.

And then it was gone, like it had never happened.

I nodded, pretending to let it go. But the unease lingered.

Why were those photos missing?

The next afternoon, the rain still poured, and I found myself back in the attic.

If those photos weren’t in the album, they had to be here somewhere.

I searched through old boxes, shifting dusty furniture aside until I found a small wooden box hidden behind a trunk.

The latch was rusted, and my hands shook as I pried it open.

Inside were photographs—old, worn at the edges, slightly curled from age.

I pulled one out.

And the ground seemed to tilt beneath me.

It was me—or at least, a little girl who looked exactly like me.

But the woman beside her wasn’t my mom.

She had wild, curly hair and soft, tired eyes. There was a warmth in her smile—a tenderness that made my chest ache, though I didn’t understand why.

She was holding the little girl’s hand—my hand—like it was the most natural thing in the world.

I turned the photo over.

Written on the back, in shaky handwriting, was a single word:

Lily.

That wasn’t my name.

Heart pounding, I shuffled through the rest of the photos.

The same woman.

The same little girl.

They were at a park, baking cookies, curled up on a couch with a book.

There were no photos of my parents—the ones who had raised me.

The knot in my stomach tightened.

I spent hours at the library that evening, combing through old newspapers.

When I finally found what I was looking for, the room seemed to shift around me, the walls closing in.

“Margaret Thompson Found Murdered; Daughter Lily Missing.”

The article detailed the brutal murder of Margaret Thompson in her home twelve years ago. Her five-year-old daughter, Lily, had vanished without a trace.

Authorities suspected kidnapping, but no suspects were ever found.

A grainy photo accompanied the article—a photo of the missing girl.

She had dark hair.

Wide, familiar eyes.

My eyes.

When I got home, the house felt different.

The walls seemed to press in too close, and the air felt heavier than before, as though something had shifted while I was gone.

I climbed the stairs slowly, my wet shoes squeaking against the hardwood floor.

Every step felt heavier than the last.

In my parents’ bedroom, I searched through drawers and closets until I found another box, tucked beneath their bed.

Inside were more photographs—pictures of the woman from the attic.

Margaret Thompson.

And at the very bottom, folded carefully, was a newspaper clipping.

“Reward Offered for Information on Missing Girl.”

Printed in bold letters at the bottom was the name that had once been mine:

Lily Thompson.

The floor creaked behind me.

I turned slowly, the weight of the truth crashing down on me all at once.

Alice—the woman I had called Mom—stood in the doorway, her expression calm, her eyes dark and unreadable.

“You weren’t supposed to find that,” she whispered.

Behind her, Jack—the man I thought was my father—stepped into view, his hands buried deep in his pockets.

He didn’t look angry. Just… disappointed.

For a moment, none of us moved.

The only sound was the steady drip of rain against the windows.

Then Alice smiled.

It spread slowly, like a crack forming across a mask.
