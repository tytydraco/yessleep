I don’t remember when it started. I was too young. 

Johnny, one of my neighbors, used to sneak in through the crawlspace at the back of my closet to play. Even now, I can still picture him so clearly in my head - his sharp blue eyes, embedded in sunken sockets. His filthy, unwashed hands, fingernails overgrown and caked in dirt. His crooked smile with three front teeth missing. 

I can smell him, too. The musk of sweat and grime, the sickly sweet stench of someone who’s been rolling in grass and dead leaves. He seems like such a recent memory, even now, nineteen years later. As much as I want to, I can’t forget him. Not after what happened in the summer of ‘06. 

*Knock. Knock. Knock.* 

Three knocks from inside my closet. That was the sign that Johnny was there. 

I opened the door, greeted by my friend, his toothy smile on full display. I returned the gesture, inviting him into my room. 

“Hurry up, I wanna show you the new game I got!” 

Pokemon Emerald had come out a year prior, and I had just managed to scrounge up enough money to buy it. I took Johnny by the wrist, his lanky frame bending awkwardly to accommodate. He didn’t protest. He listened intently as I explained the game mechanics, his eyes glued to the screen. 

That’s one of the things I liked about Johnny. He was an adult, but he didn’t treat me like all the other grown-ups did. He listened to what I had to say. He made me feel seen. Maybe that’s why I didn’t tell anyone sooner. 

After around thirty minutes, Johnny told me that he had something of his own that he wanted me to see. I perked up, temporarily distracted from my game. 

“I found it at the park today,” he said, extending a cheap camera for me to hold. I didn’t want to put him down. I had a way nicer one than that, but he was obviously proud of it. 

“Neat!” I said, turning it over in my hands. “Wanna take a picture?” 

Johnny nodded, a grin inching across his lips. I leaned in and he took a snapshot of us. We couldn’t see what it looked like. He’d need to get the film developed for that. 

“Cool. I’ll give you one when I get them back.” 

We suddenly heard footsteps creaking down the hall. Johnny’s eyes grew wide. We knew what that meant. 

He scrambled to my closet, shutting himself inside before my mother reached my room to tell me that dinner was ready. 

\*\*\*

I didn’t see Johnny very much after that. That wasn’t too unusual, though. Sometimes he would go a week or so without coming to see me. I think about ten days had passed before I heard the signal from my closet again. 

*Knock. Knock. Knock.* 

I eagerly leapt up and threw open the door. Johnny’s familiar grin was there to greet me. He accompanied me to the rug where we usually sat, stationed in front of the tube TV. 

“Come on, Johnny! You said you’d play Jenga with me last time. I got the blocks set up already,” I said, tugging him to where the tower sat undisturbed from when I’d built it days prior. 

“Ah, yeah I remember. But first, I got something for ya,” he said, pulling a photograph from his pocket. I’d forgotten all about it. 

“Here, this is for you.” He handed it to me, and I glanced down at our smiling faces. My eyes traveled from the photo to the corkboard on my wall. Johnny understood the implication. 

“Joey, you gotta keep this picture somewhere safe, okay? Somewhere your mom can’t find it. We’ll both get in big trouble if she sees.” 

I nodded. We’d been over this plenty of times before. Mom couldn’t know about Johnny. Not ever. If she found out, he wouldn’t be able to come over anymore. 

“Atta boy,” he said, ruffling my hair. “Now let’s get to this Jenga game.” 

\*\*\*

Johnny started coming by more frequently after that. He began showing up almost nightly, to the point where it was becoming routine. He would knock, I’d let him in, and we’d play with action figures or board games or draw pictures until Mom would come down the hall and scare him off. I didn’t have many friends in school, so I really enjoyed our arrangement. That is, until one night when Johnny came back… different. 

A day went by without him popping in. Then two. Then three. After I hadn’t heard from him in two weeks, I was starting to worry. What if something bad happened? As much as his absence shook me, I knew there wasn’t a thing I could do about it. I was just a kid. 

But to my relief, eventually, he did come back. Now, I wish he never did. 

I was sitting on my bed, reading a comic book when I heard it. Three knocks from inside my closet. These didn’t sound like Johnny’s regular knocks, though. They were quicker. More frantic. 

I didn’t register the difference at first. I was just happy that Johnny had finally returned. 

I leapt off my bed and raced over to the door, throwing it open with a huge grin on my face. I expected to find Johnny standing there, bearing that same toothy smile that he always did. But when I opened that door, I was met with a different sight. 

Johnny stood before me, but he wasn’t smiling. He looked even dirtier than he normally did, the coat he wore pockmarked with holes and his hands caked in a layer of grime. He had scabs on his face, as if he’d been relentlessly picking at the flesh. His eyes darted around the room, shifting from one object to another. 

My heart dropped. I could tell that something was wrong. 

“Johnny? Are you okay?” I asked, a sudden feeling of unease coursing through me. 

Johnny’s eyes snapped to me, his scleras marred by spiderwebbing red veins. He grabbed my wrist, and tried ushering me toward the closet. 

“Joey. There’s something I have to show you. Come with me.” 

He pulled me hard, his dirty fingernails digging into my flesh. Little red droplets appeared, tumbling onto the floor. By that point, I was scared. This man was not the gentle, caring friend I knew. 

I screamed, both out of fear and pain. I could hear Mom’s footsteps crashing down the hall in response. Normally, Johnny would have hidden at the sound. But not this time. He was determined to take me with him. 

“Joey, you have to see this. I *need* you to see this. They’re going to get me soon.” 

Tears involuntarily welled in my eyes. I didn’t know what Johnny had to show me, and I didn’t want to know. Fortunately, I would never have to see what it was. 

Mom burst into my room in full mama bear mode. It took her a moment to register what was happening, but the second she did, she rushed over to us and began hitting Johnny as hard as she could. He eventually let go of me and fell to the floor. Then, Mom scooped me up and bolted down the hall and into her room, where she locked the door and phoned the police. 

\*\*\*

I didn’t see Johnny being led out of the house in handcuffs. I’m glad I didn’t. I think that image would have stuck with me for a long time. 

Mom had long-since forgotten about the panel at the back of my closet, buried by old clothes and shoes. Inside was a small storage room. It turns out that there was never a crawlspace that led outside. I’d been lied to. But even more disturbing was what the police found in their search. 

Among a slew of wrappers and empty food containers, they discovered a sleeping bag, dozens of dirty needles, and photographs. Hundreds of them. 

I was in every single one.

Walking home from school, eating breakfast, playing with the neighborhood kids. I didn’t know how he got some of them. That still terrifies me. How many times had Johnny been lurking just out of sight? 

Additionally, they found a notebook. It only had one entry. The photograph that I’d taken with Johnny was taped inside with the words *Johnny and Joey, Best Friends Forever* written beneath. 

I don’t know how many years he received. We moved shortly after he was apprehended, and Mom didn’t ever bring it up again. I don’t blame her. I tried my best to forget. 

But even after all this time, I can’t get it out of my head. Sometimes, I glance down at the tiny scar on my wrist, and I wonder what would have happened if I’d followed Johnny into [that room.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)
