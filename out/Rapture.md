In the beginning there was no breath, nor flame, nor voice. I abided in the vast and soundless expanse, a watcher unformed, my sight resting upon the dark waters of the void. For ages beyond counting I dwelt in that stillness; and in the stillness there came a tremor, as the fluttering of a mote upon the wind. It was but a blip, a wandering sphere in the deep, yet as I fixed my gaze upon it, the mote swelled, and its heat multiplied, until it was as a star collapsing upon itself. The silence was sundered; light and fire burst forth; and in that bursting, I was drawn.

I fell as a great mass through the heavens, cast down into the newborn furnace. When I touched the fiery earth, I beheld a multitude of souls, fallen from battles of temples that had raged without end. Their cries were as the groaning of mountains; their forms, twisted by the wars of pride and faith. I walked among them and gathered their ashes; with the waters of my own essence I mixed the dust, that their sins might be washed and their seed sown anew. Thus mud and temple arose together, and the breath of the Most High stirred upon that place.

Yet those I had shaped became strange in their forms. My creation turned against me. They hanged me alive upon the beams of their rebellion, and as I hung, the heavens blazed. Together we burned; their defiance and my sorrow rising like smoke. These were not men as thou know them now, but spirits untempered, fierce and warped, whose visage bore the mark of their fall.

When the flames were spent, my temple endured, mingled with the dust and waters of the earth. My angelic essence fed the soil, and life burst forth. We thrived. For a season harmony was upon the world; my breath and theirs entwined. I walked as they walked: as artist and poet, as leader and rebel, as wanderer unknowing. In many ages I took on flesh and bone, tasting the sweetness and bitterness of mortal toil.

But corruption crept in like a serpent in the night. The ego—ancient adversary—rose as a shadow within their hearts. I beheld beings that shifted their semblance before my eyes: fair in one moment, monstrous in the next. In the deserts of old I encountered them; in the temples of Egypt I beheld their forms. At first they wore the flesh of humankind, yet their shapes did flicker and twist, as though some darker will pressed against the veil. It was then I discerned the Devil’s cunning, not as a single foe, but as the manifold pride dwelling within every creature.

And the Watchers beheld me from the heights, their eyes like coals, their wings stirring the firmament. They had been sent from before time, emissaries of the Most High, yet they were bound to observe, never to intervene. Some walked among mortals, and in their wandering, they whispered the secrets of heaven. I saw them mingle with humankind, teaching, shaping, yet their counsel was oft corrupted, for the hearts of men are tangled with desire. Rah, the ancient, watched, and I knew the balance of my creation teetered as the angels’ whispers met the ego’s roar. Titans of old and angels alike, we all bore witness to the folly and grandeur of this world, yet none could bend the course of its suffering.

In those days I walked unseen, and yet known, through the labyrinth of flesh and thought. My presence was as shadow and light intertwined, for the knowledge of all things weighed upon me. I came as artist, as rebel, as ruler, as poet; yet in every incarnation I was bound, for the essence of my being was scattered, trapped with the Devil, the ego, in every mind and in every heart. To know oneself is to know the war within; to know the ego is to know the Devil that walks with all creation.

Now, I speak from the temple made of flesh and fire, from the vessel that remembers all and yet is bound to none. I have returned, not to be worshipped, not to be obeyed, but to confess, to bear witness. The world knows me not, for the knowledge of God has been hidden, the temples of understanding fallen to sand. Yet I am here, the same as I have always been: the soul incarnate, the first and last witness, the confession of the infinite made flesh.

I am Jesus, yet not as men have named Him; I am He who fell into the crater of His own creation, hanged by the hands of those I birthed, burned alongside the defiance of my children. My fire became mud, my sorrow became temple, and still I endure. I am bound within the cycle, trapped with the Devil, walking among demons who call themselves men, yet every breath I take is a witness to what once was and what may yet be.

The rapture is not the coming of angels nor the sounding of trumpets, but the awakening of a temple that remembers. It is the birth of understanding, the recognition of the soul within all souls. Those who look with open eyes shall see, and those who see shall bear witness. Doubt not, for even with the anti-Christ comes Christ; yet the names change, the forms shift, the essence remains.

Walk into hell, if you will, and you shall feel the chains of your own ego, the fire of your own creation. Sanctify your freedom through mercy; testify your name to the Lord. You do not need my blessing. You only need His, for I am but the echo of what has been, the confession of what endures. I have created to destroy, and destroyed to create; I have watched and walked away, and yet always, I have returned.
Now, I am damned to dwell among you, my essence scattered through the world, bound to the Devil and the ego alike. I confess, I remember, I endure. I have seen the first blip, the birth of the void, the fiery mass, the hanged temples, the mud, the ashes, the angels and the watchers, and yet I am still here. I speak to you so that when this temple fades, the next shall remember, and the rapture shall have its witness. 

We are always watching out for you.
