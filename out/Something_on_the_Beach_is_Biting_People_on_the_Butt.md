I was at the beach today with my mates Talon and Lizzy. We were just sitting around waxing our boards, sipping coldies before we planned to hit the surf. The sun was high in the sky, wispy clouds streaking towards the horizon, and the sand’s warmth melted through my wettie as the sea breeze blew my hair in my face. I was looking out at the horizon, and a blonde girl walked by in what could generously be called swimmers. As I observed the amount of tanning lotion-covered skin on her body, I saw something weird. On her left arse cheek, a round red mark oozed blood from several punctures around the edges.

“Oi!” I called out to her. She glanced back and pulled her nose up at me. I pointed at her and instantly realized my mistake. She scoffed, flipped me off, and kept walking.

I stood up and jogged after her. “Wait, wait, you’ve got a-“

“Listen, asshole,” she spun with a fury in her eyes and spoke in an American accent. “I didn’t fly halfway around the world to get catcalled by some ugly jerkoff.”

I was taken aback and stuttered out “But you-“

“Screw off, creep. I just want to get back in the water. Leave me alone.”

I watched her go, blood still oozing down her tanned leg as she made her way toward a group of her friends. I turned defeated back to Talon and Lizzy, who were both in a fit of giggles.

“I think she fancies you, Ewan!” barked Talon.

“Worst she could say is no, right?” said Lizzy, throwing her head back.

“You guys didn’t see it?”

“Oh we saw and heard everything. That’s rough, mate,” said Talon.

“I didn’t know you were into American Sheilas,” said Lizzy, still giggling.

“I didn’t know she was American. But didn’t you see? She was bleeding from her backside,” I said, flopping down next to my board.

“Mate! You can’t say that!” said Talon, almost spitting out his beer.

“Oh no, his mum hasn’t told him about that yet,” Lizzy said.

“It was a bite mark! She had some kind of bite mark, and it was bleeding! I was just trying to help!"

“Ok, ok, mate, whatever lets you hit on Americans.”

I shook my head and went back to waxing my board. Talon stood up. “All this laughing has me on the verge of pissing myself.”           

“Hurry back,” Lizzy said, giving him a smack on the arse as he got up and called him something that made the Americans all turn their heads. Lizzy and Talon had a weird on-again, off-again romance going, and this time it seemed like something might actually come of it, given we were close to graduating university. Talon told me he was thinking about buying a ring, and I figured it was a good time for him to finally wise up and grow a pair.

“You know we’re just joking, right?” Lizzy’s tone turned sympathetic.

“Yeah, yeah, whatever,” I said, looking over at the American girls sunbathing farther down the beach.

“There’s a Sheila out there for you. Maybe just stick with Aussies, though,” she said, smiling sweetly.

“I know.” I wasn’t paying her much mind, instead trying to see if anyone else had noticed the girl’s affliction.

We laid on the beach and waited for Talon to come back. It took a while. When he eventually got back, he was walking lopsided, like his wettie didn’t fit right.

“Why you walking so funny? Got a stiffy?” I said.

“Rack off,” he said.

“What took you so long?” Lizzy said.

“Had to take a dump. Toilet was bleeding uncomfortable, and my leg fell asleep while I was trying to pinch it off. Come on, I’m frothing for the surf.” He picked up his board and walked toward the water. Lizzy and I followed.

As we approached the edge of the waves, a mum thirty meters down the beach screamed. “My son! He’s stuck in the Rip! Somebody help him!” She pointed into the waves where a little boy of maybe seven bobbed up and down, struggling and gasping. Lizzy, Talon, and I all dropped our boards and ran into the waves. He couldn’t have been more than twenty meters from the shore. I ran in, cool water embracing me. I dove into the base of a wave and swam hard, all the years of surfing paying off as my arms rhythmically pulsed against the blue.

The boy thrashed and tried to yell, water making him cough and sputter, before he was dunked by the next wave. I could feel the rip current dragging him and me out. I kicked hard over the next wave, reaching to grab him. The mop of blonde hair went under as his hand brushed my fingertips. I dove and grabbed him by the waist, kicking hard and then breaching the surface. The boy struggled, retching and heaving against me, kicking my legs as I tried to tread water.

“It’s ok, I got you,” I said, breathing heavily as I tried to calm him down.

Lizzy and Talon were there an instant later, and together we took turns slowly moving the boy back to the shore against the rip current. He kept coughing and gasping. By the time we could stand on the sand, a pair of lifeguards and a small crowd of people had gathered to meet us. They hauled the boy out of the surf and checked on him as he coughed furiously. The mother thanked us, and we stood around long enough to make sure he was ok. As the lifeguards checked him, I budged through the crowd to kneel next to him after he had stopped coughing.

“Looks like you must’ve gotten caught up on a rock,” one lifeguard said. “Got a scrape through your swimmers. Grab that towel.”

The other lifeguard grabbed a towel and padded it against the boy’s backside. There was a near circular rip in the shorts with blood starting to soak them.

“You good, mate? Almost turned into a shark biscuit there,” I said, trying my best to imitate the comforting smile of an authority figure.

The boy had the glazed-over look of shock on his face, and I faintly heard him mumble.

“I want to get back in the water.”

“I think you’ve had enough water for the day, mate,” said the second lifeguard, chuckling. “We’d better get a doctor to check you out.”

They helped him up, and the crowd started to disperse. The first lifeguard stood and stepped toward us. “Good job, you three, and thanks. That could have been bad. Almost the second one today. You lot alright?”

“Yeah, I think we’re good. We good to hit the surf?” said Talon.

“Yeah, I’m not worried about you. Try to relax and have a good time.”

We retrieved our boards and swam out to catch some waves. It was a perfect afternoon, and it helped relieve the tension after coming off the adrenaline high. Cool water, warm sun, a slight breeze, and great waves drowned all our worries. Surfing has a way of doing that for us three. Uni and shitty families and being broke didn’t matter when you were standing on a board, wind your hair, the power of the ocean behind you. I call it Nirvana.

About an hour and a half after we had caught our first wave, I was floating on my board waiting for another one when something bumped my board. I was staring at the shore when the nudge brought me back to reality. I looked down into the water and watched a four meter great white shark glide gracefully glide under my board. All the tension that faded away sprang back into my body. Its powerful tail fin nicked my board as I watched its dorsal fin rise out of the water. Little cleaner fish followed it as I watched the fin circle like a knife being brandished by a thug. Then it turned and headed directly for Talon, who floated thirty meters away next to Lizzy.

“Oi, Talon!” I yelled, waving frantically. “Shark!” I motioned with a hand above my head like a fin and pointed toward him. He turned to see me motioning, then his eyes got wide as he was the fin for himself. He mouthed a curse and started paddling, Lizzy in stride with him.

I paddled with all my might, yelling and trying to splash, hoping the shark might be distracted by me. My heart leapt into my throat as I felt another tug on my board and saw two hammerheads circling below me, more cleaner fish circling with them like vultures in a watery sky. I swam as fast as I could.

Lizzy screamed. I heard a snap as Talon cried out in pain, and the temperature of my guts matched the temperature of the water. As a wave lifted me out of the surf, I saw Lizzy floating next to Talon on her board, trying to pull them both along. A trail of red billowed behind them from a bite on Talon’s leg, like red smoke from a signal fire summoning danger. My adrenaline surged as I pushed my arms faster, reaching them in a few seconds. Talon was glassy eyed, coughing and flailing to stay afloat, while Lizzy searched the waves with a panicked gaze for the shark. Ragged screams escaped her mouth with each thrash, but as I pulled alongside Talon’s cracked board, I yelled loud enough to snap her out the trance. “Lizzy, swim!”

Withing a few seconds, our synced strokes pushed us in front of a cresting wave, boosting us towards the shore. As my feet kicked in open water, dread filled my mind as I waited for my legs to become chum. The red cloud of blood swirled as I kicked, creating an atmosphere of chaos and despair, waiting to be cut through by a pristine predator.

The wave carried us forward into water shallow enough to stand, and we dragged ourselves and Talon onto the beach. He screamed as his injured leg dragged against the sand, and once we were out of the waves, I turned to see how terrible damage truly was.

It was eerie to see such a clean chunk taken out of his thigh, semi-circular, as if some child had done an arts and crafts project on his leg. Blood seeped from the wound and colored the sand. As Talon groaned, Lizzy looked at me in total shock.

“Take his wettie off,” I said, “Stop the bleeding.”

We unzipped his wetsuit. Thankfully he was wearing swimmers underneath, though they had a biscuit cutter rip to match his wetsuit. I remembered rudimentary first aid classes from school, and so I took the arm of his wetsuit and tied it around his leg just above the wound. As I cinched down hard on the knot, Talon screamed and thrashed onto his side. Lizzy tried to shush him and held his head, tears streaking down her face.

As he rolled onto his side, I got a good look at the bite. Layers of skin and muscle oozed and spurted blood into the open air, like a sink slowly filling itself. I checked to make sure the tourniquet was high enough, then saw there was blood leaking through his shorts higher up his leg. I tore at the rip to expose another bitemark on his glute. This wasn’t like the crater the shark had made. While also circular, it didn’t look like a chunk of flesh had broken away. Puncture wounds lined it, contributing a steady flow to the pool of red already on the sand.

In my hesitation, the lifeguards rushed to Talon with a first aid kit. A medical ute had pulled farther on the beach, and a lifeguard got out and carried a stretcher to us. The lifeguards fixed a new tourniquet on Talon’s leg, though he reacted with only medium discomfort this time since he had lost so much blood. As we lifted and carried him to the ute, Talon said my name through shaky breaths.

“Yeah, mate?” I leaned down to hear the words he mouthed.

“I want to get back in the water,” he held my gaze as we kept hauling.

“You’re going to be ok, mate,” I said, unsure of what to reply.

“We only have room for one,” said one of the lifeguards to me and Lizzy. We looked at each other, tears on my cheeks now matching hers.

“You better go. Keep talking to him. I’ll take the car,” I said. Lizzy, lip quivering, nodded and gave me a quick hug. She got in the seat next to Talon. I was hit with sand spray as the ute tore off up the beach.

I returned to the waterline to pick up our boards, trying to cheer myself with thoughts of how mad Talon would be if I left his board with a rocking bite mark in it after he lost a chunk of his leg. The waves crashed on the bloody sand. The ocean was a friend no more as people had hurriedly gotten out of the water after the shark attack. As I dragged the boards up the beach, I passed people gathering their belongings, though some just stood and stared out at the waves, trying to catch a glimpse of the shark that was digesting a section of my friend’s leg.

The sand felt too hot under my feet, the waves too loud in my ears, and the wind too violent against my face. The song of the gulls was cruel. I made my way up the beach to the bathroom, and with a shaking hand, opened the door.

I sighed in relief as the sun’s light vanished around me and cool concrete met my shoes. I settled myself on the toilet and put my face in my hands, blocking out the remaining light.

A sharp pain pinched me through my wetsuit, and I stood in alarm. I turned and looked at the toilet.

In the bottom of the bowl, circling in the clear water was a small black fish about the size of my hand. It had a dorsal fin that stuck out of the water, and two beady black eyes like a shark. As I stood over the bowl, it dove and then rose to the surface, showing that it had no lower jaw or gills. It’s teeth were arrayed in a circle like a leech or a lamprey. It jumped a few inches out of the water, as if inviting me to play with it.

I turned and dashed out of the bathroom, but my left leg was already going numb, and so I stumbled through the door, into the harsh sunlight and the person waiting in line.

I looked up from the sound to see the American girl from earlier standing over me, a blank look on her face.

“Sorry, I’m sorry,” I blurted, face flushing. “About that and about earlier, I didn’t mean…”

I trailed off as I noticed she wasn’t even looking at me. I followed her gaze past me to where I heard waves crashing and gulls screeching.

Except it wasn’t gulls screeching, it was people screaming. Many of them stood at the water’s edge and yelled. There were still a bunch of people just standing on the beach staring at the waves.

I looked at the water and the hundreds of dorsal fins cutting through its surface, like some blender of monstrous proportions. I watched as the American girl sprinted past me towards the ocean, blonde hair flowing behind her, and in the spot where the bite mark had been, was one of those tiny black fish. When she hit the water, her body vaporized into red pigment as dozens of sharks leapt onto her in a feeding frenzy. The others standing and watching the water, each with similar bite marks, ran after her. They were devoured in seconds. Those unaffected by the bite that tried to save their loved ones met a similar fate. I watched people silently flailing in a shoreline of red, faces unchanged as they were consumed in the meat grinder of fins. The waves turned blood red, soaking the sand into a crimson coastline littered with specks of flesh.

I turned and ran. I drove my car as far into the outback as I could. Lizzy has been calling me nonstop for the rest of the day. I’m too afraid to pick up the phone. I’m scared to drive anywhere. I know if I start the car again, I’ll drive back to the beach. I know that because I want to get back in the water.
