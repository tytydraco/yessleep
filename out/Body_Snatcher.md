I stared down at the freshly dug hollow pit in front of me which had once been a grave. The mahogany casket, once occupied, now lay vacant at the bottom of the six foot hole. 

'And you didn't see anyone last night?' The officer asked me, writing something down in his notebook. 

I shook my head, defeated. I'm a night cemetery guard for a churchyard in the sleepy town of Orlingdale, England. Aside from shooing off the occasional group of teenagers or escorting lost mourners out of the grounds, nothing like this had ever happened at my job. 

'I don't understand who would do this,' The vicar growled behind me as the police gathered their evidence and left after promising they'd patrol the area tonight. 'What horrid person would steal a body? This is despicable.' 

He put his arm on my shoulder, reassuringly. 'You won't be working alone tonight,' He told me. 'I've called Vincent and told him what happened. He's assured me he'll be here tonight to patrol with you.' 

....

I walked through the tall iron gates of the churchyard to see Vince sat on a bench, an unlit cigarette perched between his lips. He looked up at me and smiled, holding out his open pack of smokes to offer me one. 

'Weird fuckin' thing to do, y'know,' he muttered, flicking his lighter and raising it to his mouth. 'Robbin' a grave for a corpse.' 

I nodded in agreement, taking a long drag of my cigarette. Vince was a younger man in his early 30's. He was tall and skinny, with a head of floppy blonde hair. He and I were both hired as night guards at around the same time a year ago, but we'd often be working different nights so never really got a chance to properly talk. 

I exhaled a cloud of smoke. 'Think they'll come back?' 

'Nah,' Vince replied confidently. 'Have to be pretty dumb to return to the scene of the crime the next day.'

We patrolled the grounds for hours, occasionally splitting up and linking back up to cover more ground. I began to relax as 3am rolled around, thinking Vince was probably right that they wouldn't come back. 

We eventually ended up stood on a small hill which overlooked most of the churchyard. The steeple towered in the distance as if trying to intimidate anyone who entered into its yard. 

'Are you a religious man?' I asked Vincent, who shrugged. 

'Nah, not really. Are you?' 

I shook my head. 

'Then what the fuck are we doin' workin' 'ere!' Vince laughed loudly, pulling out his pack of cigarettes. 

'We buried my sister here,' he told me, still looking off into the distance. 'We lost her in an accident, just before I started working here actually.' 

I looked at him and nodded understandingly. 

'It's a big reason I took the job,' he continued. 'Means every night that I'm not at home, I'm 'ere with her.' 

We smoked in comfortable silence for a while, finishing off our cigarettes and stubbing them out in a nearby bin. 

'What was her name?' I asked him. 

Vince looked at me, his warm blue eyes flickering with a momentary vulnerability. 

'Mila,' he replied. 'Mila Blossom Evans. She was only 19 when she died, family ain't been the same since.' 

'I can imagine.' I comforted him. 

Vince opened his mouth to speak, but was cut off by a loud metallic noise coming from the corner of the yard. 

'The fuck was that?' Vince asked in a hushed tone. 

We aimed our flashlights in the direction of the sound. A bush outside of the iron fence rustled hastily. 

'An animal?' I whispered, unable to hide the nervousness in my voice. 

We cautiously walked over to the disturbed shrubbery. 

'Look.' Vince pointed. I followed his hand to see one of the iron bars of the fence hanging limply. 

'That must be where our grave robbers been getting in.' Vince hissed. 

Our eyes met as the terrible realisation hit us like a train. 

'They aren't breaking in, they've just taken something *out.'*

We both turned and split up, trying to find the grave which had just been emptied. 

I pulled out my phone to call the police, when I heard a pained scream. I almost dropped my phone as I sprinted over to Vince, who was on his knees. 

'*Vince!'* I shouted, as I spotted him on his knees with his head to the floor. 

As I ran closer, I could hear his muffled sobs. I looked over to the freshly dug hole which sat in front of him. 

'What happened, are you hurt?' I whispered as I walked closer to him. That's when I saw the familiar name on the headstone. 

  
....

  
The police came and went, yet again taking a statement and promising to patrol. 

'More should be done,' I snapped, annoyed. 'Why aren't detectives coming to take evidence, why aren't-' 

'I know, I know,' the vicar said softly. 'Remember this is a small town. They're doing what they can for now. Forensics have already been, but we're such an isolated town. We just have to trust they're doing their best.' 

'But what about-' 

'Vincent?' The old vicar finished my sentence. 'I've insisted he go home and have some time off.' 

The vicar stepped closer to me. 'He doesn't have any family. His sister was all he had, I can't imagine what he's feeling. I'll be joining you on watch tonight while he's away. The police have searched the perimeter and secured any openings in the fence, nothing will get in or out without us knowing. ' 

....

Raised voices filled the evening atmosphere as I entered the cold iron gates of the churchyard. 

'You should be at home resting, you've no reason to be here tonight.' The vicar said sternly.

'She was my sister. I want to be here, I *need* to be here.' Vince replied sharply. 

'This isn't helping anyone, please go home.' The vicar told him. 

I walked up to them and cleared my throat. 

'Ah, thank goodness you're here,' the vicar gestured to me. 'Vincent just arrived and I've told him he should be home resting. Could you-' 

'No, I gotta be here to catch this prick.' Vince looked at me, his voice slightly breaking. 'She was my fuckin' sister, man.' 

A wave of sympathy washed over me as I remembered what the vicar had told me last night. 

'I mean, we could use all the help we can get,' I suggested. 'Three people is better than two.' 

Vince turned to look at the vicar, his blue eyes filled with desperation and pleading. 

The vicar sighed. 

'I'm not trying to be malicious, I'm just thinking about what's best for you. If you really want to stay, I can't force you to go. But I really think it's best if you were at home recovering emotionally.' 

Vince nodded. 'I'd like to stay.' 

....

  
'What do you think you're doing, stop that at once!' 

I shone my flashlight in the direction of the vicar's voice in the distance and began running towards him. 

The vicar stood on the grass with his phone to his ear. In front of him, a short man dressed in all black stood over a grave which had been partially dug into. The man stood with his hands raised in the air and a shovel at his feet. His facial details were impossible to make out due to the black ski mask over his head. 

'Please-' The man pleaded in an accent I couldn't place. 

'Now you just wait there, the police are on their way.' The vicar told him sternly. 

I felt a rush of wind as Vince lunged past me and tackled the man. 

'Stop it, now stop it!' The old vicar yelled as Vince began throwing punches. 

The vicar grabbed Vince by the shoulders and attempted to pry him from the man, who had curled himself into a ball to protect himself from the blows. 

I grabbed Vince's other shoulder and we managed to pull him off his prey. 

During the scuffle, Vince had unmasked the grave robber. He looked to be in his 40's, with short dark hair and brown eyes. He was sweating heavily'  

'Please,' the man begged. 

'What's your name?' The vicar wanted to know. 

'Andres,' the man responded nervously. 'Andres Rivera.' 

'And what are you doing in my churchyard every night digging up the deceased?' The vicar demanded.

'Please,' Andres repeated. 'It will kill me.' 

'What are you talking about?' 

Andres took a breath, still sitting on the floor with his legs to his chest. 

'It followed me over here... I fled from the Philippines. It followed.'

'Who followed you?' The vicar asked, looking confused. 

'It smelled the death on me,' Andres continued. 'I have an illness, not long left.' 

Andres noticeably shuddered, clutching his legs closer to his chest like a scared toddler. 

'I ran away, but it came after me. It found me. I feed it to keep it away. Please, it will kill me.' 

'I don't understand,' the vicar spoke up. 'What's come after you?' 

Andres looked up at him, his eyes wide. 

'Bal-Bal.' 

'I beg your pardon?' The vicar asked, leaning closer to the terrified Andres. 

'Bal-Bal,' Andres repeated, a tremble in his voice. 'In my home town in the Philippines, we were told stories as children about the creature that steals corpses and stalks the dying. I thought it was just stories, but then I got ill. I heard it every night on my roof. I smelled its putrid rotten odour. I saw its evil face at my window waiting for me to die so it can-' 

Andres was abruptly cut off by Vince. 

'This is bullshit,' Vince snapped. 'Why are we listening to this weirdo's bollocks story. He's obviously fuckin' insane and eating corpses.' 

'No, no,' Andres shook his head violently. 'I wouldn't... I only took what was necessary.' 

'Yeah, you took my fuckin' sister,' Vince spat, a malicious look in his eyes. 'There's a lotta empty graves here I could fill...'

'No, please. I'm sorry, I- I didn't know, I- please don't. I'm sorry.' 

I held my arm up to block Vince, who looked like he wanted to resume his attack on the snivelling Andres. 

'You don't understand what it's like!' Andres yelled with a broken voice. 'I have my final months in fear of this creature. I will not know peace.' 

'Now, calm down.' The vicar instructed. 'The police are pulling up now. Vincent, go and unlock the gate.' 

'Police, no. No!' Andres shouted desperately. 'I need to feed it, I can't-'

'That's enough now please,' The vicar said assertively. 'You're clearly unwell. I hope you get the care you need.' 

The three of us stood back and watched Andres be led away in handcuffs, his cries and pleas falling on deaf ears. 

....

I woke up feeling a sense of accomplishment. There was a spring in my step as I flicked my bread into the toaster and poured a cup of coffee.

I practically skipped to work that day, relieved that this shift will be as uneventful and mind numbingly boring as it was before. 

Vince volunteered to work with me tonight, ignoring the vicar's advice to take some time away. 

The hours practically flew by as we trudged up and down the gravelly paths. 

And then, I smelt it. A putrid smell, as if I'd walked into a tomb of a hundred rotting bodies. 

'What the fuck?' I choked, covering my nose. 

Vince shone his flashlight around. 'What's that smell, I'm gonna puke!' He spat, clasping his hand over his mouth. 

A shadow briefly covered the moon. 

'What was that?' I asked, looking up into the crisp night sky for anything out of the ordinary. 

'Up there.' Vince pointed to a dark figure balanced on the tiles of the steeple. 

'What the fuck, who's that?' I whispered. 

'It's fucking Andres,' Vince snapped. 'I'm gonna kill him!' 

'I don't think Andres could get up there,' I said, the nervousness I'd been pushing down escaping into my voice. 'I don't think anyone could get up there.' 

Vince's face turned from fury to fear as he realised what I was saying. 

Before either of us could say another word, the figure quickly scaled down the steeple roof with a natural ease no human could manage. As it reached the roof of the church building, it extended its long arms and glided out of sight. 

I looked at Vince. His face was pale, and his wide eyes remained locked on where the creature had gone. 

'We need to leave.' I whispered, terrified. 

'Our only way out is past where that thing went.' Vince replied, his voice haunting and hollow. 

I cursed when I remembered the opening in the fence that Andres had used, which had now been sealed off. 

'I say we run for it,' Vince whispered. 'Don't look back, just run to the gate.' 

'What, no way!' I hissed. 

'Then what? You wanna wait in here with this fuckin' thing?' Vince hissed back. 

'Call the police,' I told Vince. 'They'll help us.' 

Vince went quiet for a moment, before confessing. 'I never take my phone to work. No point, who am I gonna message? Only person I had that meant anything's gone. I got you, but I'd feel like a twat messaging you on your nights off.' 

I frantically dug my phone from my pocket, my hand shaking so hard I could barely type in my passcode. 

The loud sound of a branch breaking behind us propelled us into fight or flight, Vince grabbing my sleeve and pulling me, causing me to drop my phone as we fled.

We ducked behind a large headstone in the middle of the yard, gasping for breath. 

'Vince, I dropped the phone.' I whispered, frantic. 

'Ahh, *fuck*. It's ok.' Vince tried to calm me, although I could hear the masked desperation in his voice. 

'Can you see it?' I asked him, too scared to move from the false safety of our limestone cover. 

'I'll check.' Vince slowly and silently rose onto his knees, building up the courage to peer around the grave. 

I felt my stomach tighten suddenly. I tried to force myself to take a deep breath, but it felt as though my abdomen were in a vice. I reached down to clasp the pressure in my side, when my hand met something wet, cold and unfamiliar. I looked down. 

Gripping my thick winter coat was a grey, slimy bony clawed hand. 

'*Vince!'* I screamed, frantically squirming out of the creatures clutch. 

Vince looked over at me, before looking back and becoming face to face with the putrid creature. It then stood upright and towered over us as we began desperately crawling backwards. 

It was tall, with dark crimson eyes, yellow rotten teeth and a disgustingly long tongue which seemed to lap hungrily at its chest. Its skin was a horrible greenish grey, and it's arms were connected to its entire torso by a tight flap of skin, similar to a bat. Its limbs looked almost human, with five long, sickly fingers all accompanied by filthy, bloodied claws. 

And the smell. The creature smelled like the pinnacle of decomposition. It's hot breath filling our lungs with the unescapable stench of death. 

Vince grabbed my arm, pulling me up. '*Come on!'*

He pulled me along as we weaved in between headstones. Tears clouded my vision and my trousers felt cold and heavy where I had unknowingly lost control of my bladder.

Vince suddenly tripped, sending us both hurtling forwards mid sprint. I fell hard onto the gravelly floor, feeling a burning pain in my hand which had been scraped under my body weight. 

'Vince,' I whispered, groggily pulling myself up and turning to look at him. 'We have to ke-' 

My heart dropped when I saw Vince, lying motionless on the grass next to a hollow grave, a large wound across his head. 

I looked at the bloodied headstone beside him. 

**Mila Blossom Evans, forever 19**

**Beloved sister and friend. A short life lived to the fullest.** 

'Vince?' My voice quaked as I crouched over him and shook his lifeless body. 'Vince? *Vince, please!'* I begged him. 

But Vince never got up. The empty look in his glassy blue eyes telling me his soul had left. 

I wiped my tear soaked cheek with my sleeve and began hurriedly backing away as the creature slowly began to crawl along the gravel path towards Vance's body. 

'No...' I mustered as it cocooned his carcass with its fleshy wings '*No!'* 

The creature plunged its salivating tongue into Vince's eye socket, not even looking at me. I froze, sheer terror forbidding me from vomiting with disgust. The creatures sharp claws tore the clothes from Vince's body effortlessly as it began to rip away at his flesh. 

I backed up in horror until I felt a familiar stone wall behind me. The church. I looked to the left to see the tall iron gates willing me towards them. I took one last look back at the creature. 

It locked eyes with me, as its long tongue was preoccupied consuming Vance's body. It had a look of hatred in its eyes, as if it despised me for still living. 

I turned towards the gate and fled, not even stopping to unlock the heavy padlock. I gripped the iron bars tightly, forcing my foot on top of the bolts of the gate as I clambered up. I threw my leg over and collapsed from the top of the gate, landing hard on my feet. Ignoring the pain in my ankles, I desperately sprinted to the closest house I could find; the vicars'. 

I must've ran for about twenty minutes without stopping, practically kicking the vicars' garden gate off its hinges as I pounded on his door. 

A face peaked at me from the window, before a startled vicar opened the door in his pyjamas. 

'What's happened, are you ok? What's going on?' He asked, panicked. 

Everything began spinning as I collapsed into his front door as he tried to catch me. 

....

 I woke up the next afternoon in a hospital bed. After having myself discharged, I used the hospital phone to call a taxi to the vicars house. I knocked on his door, less frantic this time. 

He opened the door in a pair of blue jeans and a relaxed cardigan, looking surprised to see me. 

'Oh, you're out already? You should've called. Come in.' 

 We sat in his living room and I told him everything that had happened that night. 

'Yes, I'm sorry to hear about Vincent. I know he was fond of you, you were a friend to him.' The vicar sympathised. 

'Would you mind sitting with me while I recount all this to the police?' I asked him. 'I'm worried I'll forget some of the details I told you.' 

'Oh, I don't think we need to tell them any of that,' the vicar shook his head. 'Andres was let out on bail last night, let's just say he came back and did all of this.' 

My mouth fell open. 'W-what do you mean?' I asked him. 

The vicar shrugged. 'Well, I don't think the town needs to hear about this demonic being.' 

The vicar leaned forward in his chair. 'Can you imagine what this will do to my church if the members hear a satanic creature taunts the churchyard, it will destroy their faith.' 

My eyes widened. The vicar's expression softened. 'Relax,' he said calmly. 'I'm not making a threat. I'll make a deal. You keep quiet about this, and I'll pay you for helping me.' 

'But what about the-' I began.

'The demon? It will lose interest and go elsewhere. Andres said it's following him, chances are it will go back to where it came from once it has him. It doesn't seem to be able to dig the graves up by itself here.' 

I looked at him, anxious. 

'I've always been good to you. I gave you and Vincent jobs when nobody else would. The money I'll transfer to you, we'll call it compensation for what you had to go through at my church. Pretend it's money for therapy or whatnot. Then you can finally get yourself a little place in the city, like you've always talked about. All I need is for you to let me do the talking...'

  
....

I gazed out my window, the vibrant life of the city radiating through my apartment. 

I left my home in Orlingdale that same week, choosing to remain quiet and let the vicar tell the authorities whatever story he could come up with. 

The vicar sent me a letter last week. It was brief, with no mention of the incident at all. He mentioned Andres had sadly passed away recently. I looked him up online to see if there were any details about him and found a small news article from the towns local paper. It reported that Andres body was being flown back to his hometown by his family, and nothing more.  I stuffed the letter into my desk drawer, having no desire to respond. 

It's been 3 months since the incident, and nobody's reported seeing the creature since. Maybe it went back to the Philippines with Andres, maybe it stuck around, maybe it moved on to a different country altogether. 

I don't know.

 I hope I never know.
