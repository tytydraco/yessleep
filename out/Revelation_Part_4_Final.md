Part 3

After the Shrek incident, Clara and I broke up for good. She got a new boyfriend and sent me nasty messages all the time but I just ignored them.

Once Covid 19 hit everyone was on lockdown. Store hours changed, nothing was open past midnight anymore in Fredericton. The deer came into the city in droves at night, since  there was virtually no traffic. Everyone had to wear masks in public.


One day when I was sitting in my apartment looking at my game collection. We were all locked inside so there was not much else to do but consume media. I reached into the pile of games and pulled out The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild.


I hadn’t gotten very far in this game. I remember thinking it was massively overhyped. I popped it back in and played for a few hours. After a while I started feeling cuff links on both of my wrists and ankles.


Yahweh's voice rung through my head ‘This game is in on it too. It’s the breaking weapons this time. Each time a weapon breaks it makes the spell more powerful. I’d advise you to stop playing soon because this game is really going to get you if you don't.’


I stopped playing breath of the wild and went back to my collection to find another game. This time I pulled out The Last of Us. 


I started playing and started a new file. In the first room of the game I picked up a birthday card with a suspicious looking T Rex on it. “Congratulations”, it read.

Yahweh spoke with vigour. ‘Be glad you didn’t finish this game. If you did you would have gotten a tick from the evangelion spell for picking that up. ‘


I immediately turned off the game and went back to my collection. I reached in and pulled out Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast.


I started playing the game and almost got to the end of the arcade mode. My car stopped because I was out of time, right before the finish line. The banner above it read “Congratulation”.


I spoke to Yahweh in my head. ‘This game can’t be an evangelion curse too? What is everything cursed? That's the feeling I’m starting to get from this.’


Yahweh responded ‘Yeah Sean, an attempt at the same curse as The Last of Us. This one gives you a weaker version of it though. The grammatical error making it obvious doesn’t make it as dangerous as something with much better graphics. And that’s the thing. Pop in LA Noir and take a look at the graphics, then take a look at Red dead redemptions graphics. Made by the same company, 1 year apart.’


I did what he told me and noted that though both games were on the PS3, LA Noir looked like a PS4 game and Red Dead Redemption looked like a PS2 game.


Yahweh spoke up. ‘Maximillian, the evil king of the world wanted them to get to graphics that were good enough to fool him, then stop and not progress after that. They showed him Read Dead Redemption and he played it for about 2 hours then told them they needed better graphics. The next year, industry wide, all the games took a generational leap graphically, on the same hardware. They did the same thing with gameplay at the PS2 generation, and they won’t let anyone make anything better or else they stop them. All the cursed games would stand out if there was anything decent to compare them against.’


I was totally spooked out. ‘What do you expect me to do? We are basically locked inside with nothing to do.’


Yahweh responded sternly. ‘Yeah but the same people who made all these curses are the ones who put you on lockdown. That way you have nothing else to do but curse yourself with all the crap you’ve accumulated over the years.’

‘Whatever’ I thought. I turned the video game consoles off and turned on the TV. I was watching the history channel thinking, ‘this can’t be cursed’ when I heard the voice of the lord.


‘Turn that shit off right now or else.’ Yahweh warned.


I put the TV on mute and started playing on my computer. Before long I felt something watching me. I spun around in my chair back to the TV to see a giant golden dragon eye, writhing around on the screen. It writhed around for seconds then disappeared with the show in its place.


Yahweh spoke up ‘Turn that off and unplug the cable box, or the next eye is going to be red. And I’ll have to delete you.’


I unplugged the cable box and smashed it. I then looked at the TV and all the video game consoles plugged into it.


Some old, some new, they all seemed tethered together, and they seemed angry.


Yahweh spoke again. ‘The switch really was the switch. From “we are pretending this is safe” to “we are going to kill you and not even hide it.” The switch has a bunch of code that it can upload to old consoles wirelessly. They are adding fountains full of blood to old games that are saved on Wii’s, PS3’s and even xbox 360’s. IT still gets worse too. These consoles have different functions, the PS4 is a sacrificial altar. The switch is an evil alien who will sacrifice you over the altar.’



I then became aware that the PS4, though in rest mode, was making a very loud, high pitched noise. It was just on the edge of too high a frequency to hear.



I went and unplugged the power bar that powered all the consoles, and then something terrifying happened.


Electricity discharged through the consoles and the power cable began flopping around at high speeds. It then rose up straight for a second, then launched right towards my eye. I dogged it at the last second and it nicked my forehead, leaving a gash.


I grabbed the cable after that and it went limp. I didn’t plug any of the consoles in after that and sold most of them and my games to a local pawn shop.
