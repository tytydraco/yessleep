I have never told anyone this, and I planned to keep it that way, but I don’t know how much longer I’ll be safe; I think it’s learning to crawl.

My family can’t know the truth, and I have no friends left to trust. So I’m turning to the internet, posting this everywhere I can, hoping at least one person knows what was growing inside me—and why, even after I tore it out, it’s still tormenting me.

I will start from the beginning.

The first double lined test was April 22nd 2025. A solid positive on the strip test, and a further 3 positives with more accurate pregnancy tests. A baby was never in my plans for adulthood but something shifted when that second line bled into view, a week after I deleted his number, and it felt right. Every maternal cell in my body swelled and there was no denying that I was keeping that baby.

The first few weeks were incredible. I jumped straight into decorating the nursery, the smaller room in my two bed apartment. My skin was glowing, my mental health had improved, and life was seemingly perfect. Ultrasounds showed its little webbed feet and hands beginning to separate, a healthy heartbeat, and the steady vitals of me and my baby. 

Around the seventh week the cravings started. When I found myself drowning my bacon with banana ice cream, a warm glee rose in my stomach as the whole pregnancy was becoming realer. But the following weeks felt different, and my body began rejecting the meat. I threw up my breakfast every morning but the insatiable want for bacon wouldn’t go with it, i needed it, yearned for it every second of the day.

The hunger kept me up at night, clutching my stomach in a horrific pain, sobbing till my throat hurt in fears of starving the baby. Nothing could please the desperate need for meat until the morning of my ninth week. I plodded to the fridge, sluggish and plagued by insomnia, and took out the week old strips of untouched bacon. The smell was revolting, a harsh pinching stench that made me gag and drop the packet to the floor. 

But as the slabs of raw meat hit the tile, the urge to consume returned. The same frantic craving washed down my throat and into the pit of my stomach and before I could process the reality of the situation, I was shovelling the cold, wet meat from the floor and into my mouth. The slimy, rotting bacon slipping down into my stomach was a pleasure I’d never experience before. I felt full and well, no longer exhausted and malnourished, like this was the ice cold water in the middle of a desert.

I could feel it shift inside of me, consuming the goodness of its first meal in days, and I sat with my back pressed against the counter when I heard it. Barely audible, like a faint whisper.

“Thank you, Mama.”

Voices in your head is never a good sign, even I knew this, but this wasn’t just a voice, it was my baby. That weak, strained mumble was the satisfaction of my healthy, beautiful child, and the nauseating residue of raw meat that stuck to my tastebuds was the hidden treasure to my babies health.

The cravings grew as fast as the cells in my stomach, and louder than its pleading. My head was filled with begging, the constant voice no longer a distant whisper in my mind, and every trip to the store was for poultry. At first it was bacon, then beef cut offs, lamb legs, even a whole chicken, until it was no longer enough.

It was becoming too distressing. I stopped talking to my family, unable to form sentences with the overlapping mumbling in my head, and cancelled three hospital check ups in a row. The life was being sucked from me, my muscles were weak, my memory fogged, and the hunger unbearable.

When my tire crunched over something, returning home from another unsatisfactory shopping trip, a splatter of grey fur and guts painted the road and I stopped crying. That smell. Clotted blood, raw and torn meat, it was salivating.

“Please.”

The voice echoed in my thoughts, however it had gotten to a point were i was unsure if it was my baby begging for it, or me. The dead critter, what i can only imagine was a rabbit, didnt twitch or cry out. it was dead on impact, its small skull shattered under the car and its guts ripped from its belly. There was no hesitation in my actions and the scene still haunts me. I didnt even have the decency to take the corpse home before i started digging into its organs, ripping its miniature intestines, lungs and heart out and chewing the fleshy, blood-soaked meat until there was nothing but fur and skin left to rot on the road.

That night was torment for me, more than the past few months had reckoned on me. I was screaming at the noise in my head, the reality of my actions finally setting in as i washed the animal blood and chunks of sticky flesh from my hands and wrists. The taste no longer satisfied my hunger, it left a stinging disgust on my tongue, and my stomach bulged and bloated. My insides felt like they were being twisted and knotted together, something weaving in and around my own organs, a contorting pain writhing for hours until finally, I couldn't take it anymore.

“What are you?”

I stood in the bathroom, staring at my inflated stomach in the full-length mirror, and demanded answers. It was the first time in months i had gotten a real look at my body in full, and i was horrified. Without clothes to hide myself, i saw what the baby was really doing to me. sucking the nutrients from me, my skin was pale and blotchy all over, my bones poking from each joint and my ribs fighting against the tumour-like lump that was my belly. This wasnt a child anymore, no child would rinse me of life like this. My baby wasnt going to infect me like a parasite, i wanted it out.

“Mama?”

“Don’t you dare call me that. You are NOT my child.”

I screamed. I was angry. This baby was supposed to be the light of my life, this pregnancy was going to break me out of my mental illnesses and help me recover with another part of me to look after. My child was not supposed to curse me and i was certainly not going to let it control my life any further.

I called the ambulance first, anticipated the time they would take to get to me before i bled out onto the linoleum. When the responder assured me that help would be with me soon, and that i should stay on the phone and talk to her before acting on my impulse, i hung up and grabbed single-blade facial razor from the sink drawer.

Cutting through your own stomach is more euphoric than most would think. The pain numbs into a dull ache after the first layer of tight skin is ruptured, and the feeling of your own blood spilling from a hip to hip incision is a unique type of relief. I remembered hearing it cry out, begging me to stop, but i immersed my hearing into the ripping of muscle against the point of the blade and the surgical focus of slicing in the same place over and over.

I passed out the second i broke the barrier between my insides and the bathroom floor. I felt an odd release of pressure from the lower point of my stomach before losing consciousness. My memory is fogged from the sheer blood-loss and agony of the at-home c-section, but something had happened between this and the ambulance busting down my door. I woke up in the hospital, slightly amazed at my survival, surrounded by family members and doctors.

One mental health assessment and grief counselling meeting later, and I was discharged back to my apartment. On the records, I had a mental break a month and a half after learning of my early stage miscarriage. The pain of loosing my child and isolating myself for so long led to another suicide attempt, only this time opting for a more metaphorical end than the normal person. Of course this was ridiculous to hear but I smiled and nodded, agreeing that this tragic failed pregnancy was in fact the cause for such drastic self-injury, and cooperating with the teams and showing such a fast recovery led me to my swift and trusted discharge.

Tonight marks a week since I returned to my home, returned to the nursery and the trauma of the last months. I was pleasantly surprised to hear my baby calling for me the moment i shut the world out, cooing and gurgling like a newborn. While i did get sent home from the hospital without my baby in a carrier, bundled in blankets and motherly love, those things were all waiting for me in the nursery. My little newborn, taken from the womb by my own hands and placed carefully in his bassinet, waiting for his mother to feed, cuddle and love him.

I was leaving his favourite snacks out on the blankets, finding them gone in the morning, and rocking his shrivelled, purple body in my hands just as i had pictured that day i saw the double lines. It was just as perfect as i had imagined.

But that isnt the reason i came to share my story. I had learned to dismiss his violent words swirling in my head, and knowing he was eating was enough to keep me satisfied. But he’s stopped eating so much now, I leave the meat overnight incase he wants it but i find it covered in buzzing flies and mould by morning, and the crying is getting worse. My head is pounding all the time, my stitches throb and weep, and the pain meds arent soothing me to sleep anymore.

Last night, in the silence of my apartment building, I heard a thick, slimy thud from the nursery, and the faint, sludgy pattering of underdeveloped hands dragging and slapping across the wooden floor, right up to my bedroom door.

What do I do?
