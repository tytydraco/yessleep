I was in the Cable Room just after my lunch break. I probably shouldn’t have eaten so many Maelstrom bites because my stomach was churning. The cable room is dark and cool. I like it in there, even though it’s quite dangerous. Something about the twisting cables and small spaces to crawl through made me feel safe. Though, there was one room that was so horrifying, the thought of it nearly made my Maelstrom bites come back to say hello. The Overseer System room. Blue wires coated the walls and it was home to a spider like machine called The Overseer’s Eye. It’s made of navy-blue titanium and has a large, ominous eye in its centre. I was dreading going to that place so I tried to avoid it until the end of my shift. Little did I know that would be my downfall. 

I had been doing the usual, repairing the countless devices, warding of entities and crawling through tunnels when it happened. The facility went on lockdown. The familiar colour of the cables faded to red, then purple. It was then I realised it. I should’ve done it earlier. I should’ve visited that room earlier. The Overseer’s armour was unstable. That could only mean one thing. I ran to the Overseer Systems room, hoping it hadn’t gotten out yet. 
It had. The Overseer’s Eye escaped. The Overseer was complete. If the eye is gone it must be piloting the armour. A speaker sounded out. 
“All entities have been incapacitated by The Overseer temporarily. Hide in a small enclosed space that is far away from the Cable Room.”
That was even worse. I was IN the Cable room. I ran and crawled and squirmed to the exit, hoping I could get there before the Overseer found me. As I made it to the home stretch, I unholstered my pistol, it would only do something to that creature if I hit the eye. I slammed shoulder first into the door and burst out into the hall. I needed to make it to the server room. As I rounded the first corner, I saw it.

It towered over me with gleaming white armour and four spider-like legs. The armour had glowing red detailing and the spider legs had blue details. It had the appearance of a medieval knight, and it had a missing arm which was replaced slimy black tendrils that twisted into a sharp blade. Out from the chest plate, crawled the eye. It didn’t speak. Just let out a robotic cackle. I raised my pistol and fired 8 rounds at the eye. Only one hit and it screeched loudly, crawling back into the armour. The Overseer slashed at me with its sword. I quickly rolled out of the way and began running. I reloaded my pistol. I would need it to destroy the Organic Server. I dashed around corners, the metallic clunking of The Overseer behind me. 
Finally, I made it to the servers. I crashed through the door and practically flew through the maze like structure of the server room. After a while of maze running, I reached a door marked ‘Organic Servers’. I opened it and stepped inside.

In that room was a fleshy server made of meat and hair. I raised my pistol and fired the entire magazine at the server. I heard the crash of The Overseer. I had done it.
Suddenly, my head began to ache. I felt a vr like device on my head and ripped it off. I found myself in a cold grey room. 
“Oh right. The device.” I remembered aloud.
