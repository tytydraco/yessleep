Thirteen. That’s how many times I’ve [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ek4kgj/theres_a_trapdoor_no_one_knows_whats_below_it/) been below. Now, I’m sitting on the top step looking down into the blackness as if I could see whatever lies beyond. I stare, and stare, and all the hairs on my body stand on end as I listen to her pleas.

Sophie. 14 years old. She hired me to help find her sister, Chloe, 17, who disappeared down the trapdoor ten days ago. Now Sophie is trapped, too.

“Jack!” she sobs. “Jack, please, help me!”

But each time I’ve tried rescuing her, I’ve rushed back up with my pulse jackhammering and throat raw with screams. No memory of what lies below. Cameras and phones do not work down there. And there’s the smell… an odor of putrefaction. My only clue to saving Sophie and her sister lies in the things I’ve brought out with me on those previous trips:

1)    yellowed pages with instructions in Latin and Aramaic

2)    a message in sharpie marker on my arm: *Victim Alive. Must Perform* *~~Incantation~~* *Ritual. Escape.*

3)    A handwritten note: *Do not* ***g****o* ***d****own!!! If you want to* ***m****ake* ***s****ure* ***S****ophie* ***i****s* ***s****afe, break the wards that are* ***s****et around the* ***t****rap door. Stay* ***u****pstairs!!!* ***U****se the notes to dispel the wards. Do not come down again, because your* ***l****ight draws it* ***t****o her!! Sophie is hiding* ***b****lind in the dark from the thing that took her sister.* ***I****t was summoned here by the wards, which keep it in this world, but if you* ***b****reak* ***t****he* ***w****ards* ***t****hen that will* ***k****ill* ***i****t (dispel it) and set Sophie free.* ***W****hen* ***i****t is gone Sophie will be able to* ***c****ome* ***u****pstairs* *safely.*

From these, I’ve gleaned a plan—one that relies on a dangerous deception. In the next few minutes, I’ll either succeed in my swindle… or doom us all.

Whatever happens, this will be my final trip.

And *this* time, I will remember.

Wreathed in the odor of death, I step down into the pitch blackness…

\*\*\*

A few hours before my fateful descent, I was in a greasy Milwaukee diner waiting for my ex-girlfriend—the only person I could think of who could translate my first clue, the yellowed pages, and break the wards. I hadn’t seen Emma since our breakup.

When she entered the diner, her eyes fell on the gold locket around my neck. She gave it to me on our anniversary. Called me her “grifter with a heart of gold.” The locket is a heart-shape inscribed with smaller hearts with a picture inside of her making a heart, and it’s absolutely not something a straight dude can wear. Not just because it’s girly—I sometimes have been known to rock a ponytail or wear ~~pink~~ salmon or pose provocatively in the nude (“Paint me like one of your French girls!”)—BUT I am lactose intolerant and this “heart of gold” was too much cheese. Like, any cheesier and it’d be pizza!

… probably shouldn’t have told her that, though.

Anyway, I never wore it. But then came that post-breakup life of booze and bitterness and bachelor salad. When you’re standing at the sink chomping on a lettuce head taking swigs from the dressing bottle (still naked, but this time just so you can wash off your dribblings in the shower) and you spot that flash of gold… suddenly, it hits different, the fact someone once thought enough of you to gift you this. *Why did you call it cheesy, you asshole?*

In the diner my ex saw me wearing it for the first time as I smiled and said, “Hey Babe—”

“DON’T call me Babe.”

“Sorry Babe. That wasn’t on purpose, sorry. It’s just, I still think of you in my head as—"

“STOP.” She waved a hand like swiping me off her screen. “I don’t care. Shut up. Don’t call me Babe.”

“… Yes ma’am.” Suddenly I wished I’d met her at the trapdoor instead. Because then I could at least throw myself down it.

“I’m only helping you for the sisters,” Emma said as she sat at the table. “I can break the warding. But. Everything I’ve read based on those pages you sent me says I shouldn’t. That to break it is to unleash demons. So you’d better have a damned good plan, Jack…”

\*\*\*

My pulse ratchets up, the blood in my ears drowning out the *creeaaak* of each rickety wooden step. My veins are spiked with adrenaline on this final descent—but also, *curiosity*. Because why have I failed over a dozen times? What keeps sending me up screaming? *What the fuck is down there?*

My clues aren’t enough. The desire to know is so potent it’s a craving, an intoxicating urge, like I’m an addict and *seeing what’s down there* is how I get my hit.

Even if the sisters weren’t missing, I’d probably be on these stairs. Creeping down just to *know.*

By the time I hit bottom, I’m swimming in an inky darkness.

I hold my sleeve over my nose against the stench, noting the crumbling stone, the dusty shelving under my flashlight.

Old cans sit on the nearby shelf—*Carnation Evaporated Milk, Van Camp’s Pork and Beans*, *Campbell’s Soup*—it’s “Mmm, Mmm, good,” though probably not anymore. This stuff must’ve been canned decades before I was born. I step across the room and grab a few of the cans, piling them in my arms and quickly stacking them on the stairs, and it’s as I’m stacking the last one that a fly crosses my light and whizzes past my ear. Is it just me, or has the buzzing gotten… *louder?*

Dread knots my gut.

I realize I’m holding my breath. When I suck in the next gulp of air—Christ, the smell! I aim my light in the direction of the flies, and freeze. There’s something there, underneath the staircase.

Oh, God.

My beam traces discolored fingers, greenish gray and blotchy up a delicate wrist. I recognize the charm bracelet on that wrist from a video where the sisters were taste testing ramen, rating them by spiciness and mouthfeel and… my chest sinks. The arm is bent at a strange angle. The body crumpled like a broken puppet. My beam finds the face. The eyes eaten away by flies.

It’s Chloe.

\*\*\*

The ink on my arm, a scrawl in sharpie marker in my own sloppy hand, is my second clue:

*Victim Alive. Must Perform* *~~Incantation~~* *Ritual. Escape.*

Clear enough instructions. But why so dramatically cryptic? Why such bad sentencing? Why not just tell myself what’s actually fucking down there?

The answer, of course, is that I *did* tell myself. Because I wrote those seven specific words in a specific order, and if you put the capitals together—

“Yeah, yeah, you get ‘V-A-M-P-I-R-E,’” Emma interrupted as I tried to explain in the diner. “Obviously some sort of vampiric entity wants you to break the wards and made you write the sharpie message assuming you’d believe your own handwriting. I deciphered your other note, too. What I don’t get is why you need to go back down. You *know* what will happen.” She drew a finger across her throat, and then pointed to my neck. On my last trip down, when I got the yellowed pages, I came back up holding a knife to my throat. I’d nicked the skin, blood dribbling as I stared into one of the cameras I’d set up to document everything, and repeated a warning: “Do not go back down…. Do not go back down… *do not go back down!*”

“Maybe,” Emma said, eyes narrowed to slits, “you shouldn’t fucking go back down.”

\*\*\*

Flies buzz in and out of Chloe’s sockets—and coffee from the diner surges up. I heave my guts in the corner. Keep heaving til I’m hollow. Slam my fist on the crumbling mortar.

“FUCK!!” I scream.

Oh, I *knew*. I *knew* this morning from the very moment I pried open the trapdoor. It was like cracking the lid of a Tupperware of rotting meat marinated in sewage. There could be only one fate for the sister missing for ten days below with no water…

But finding the source of the smell nonetheless wrings my insides like a rag. How many times did I run up and down those stairs with her corpse right below my feet…?

“*Jack!*”

Sophie. Calling from somewhere further in, still alive. Aiming my puny light into the blackness, I plunge down the hallway into a large, bare room. My beam is a small yellow circle traveling across a canvass of solid black, slowly revealing: cracked floor, crumbling walls, a few items of slowly decaying furniture—an old trunk, an ottoman, a very old chair.

My light finds a door. Darting over, I lean back against it, rap my knuckles on the wood. “Sophie?”

“JACK!” Shuffling, and then her voice right up against the door, high and tremulous: “Jack I knew you’d come back, I knewyou’dcomeback, I knewyou’dcomeback…”

“*Shhh,* are you safe in there?”

“I… I-I think so. It hasn’t come in. Chloe was in here… She, she used the corner for the bathroom.” Sophie’s voice quavers. “But she’s not here now. Last week, when I called to her and the trapdoor was still closed—do you think that’s when she left this room? She… she… is it my fault that she went out there…”

“No,” I say quickly. “No, it’s not your fault”—but now, I’m envisioning Chloe’s last moments, hours hiding from whatever is down here in the dark, no food or water… and then hearing her sister’s voice… fleeing the relative safety of this closet and scrambling for the stairs in the pitch blackness—only to find the trapdoor *shut*—

“Jack,” whispers Sophie.

—I am yanked out of my imagining by the tingling along my nape. And a shuffling sound. The sensation of being *watched.*

Every hair stands on end.

“… Jack?” she says.

I strain my ears.

“It… i-it’s down here…” she whimpers. “Out there with you.”

*THANK YOU Sophie I’m aware*. My light flicks around like my wrist is having a seizure. My flesh crawls with the spider skitter of terror. *WHAT is making that sound?* Like hands rubbing. Like bare feet sliding on stone. Like lips smacking. I try to remind myself that the source of that sound is what I am searching for—

My light catches on a figure.

In the split second in which my beam passes over it, the figure is hauntingly tall. Stooped. Naked, like the statue of a withered old man with freakishly long nails, frozen in an awkward slouch, mid-step toward me. It smells like a corpse freshly dug out of a grave, and its eyes are squeezed tightly shut, as if after so many decades in the dark, it cannot bear even my weak light—

I see all this in the fraction of an instant that my beam flashes over it—*Oh Jesus Christ FUCK me*—I flick the light back to that same spot, only that spot is now empty—

“*Uuufff!*”

—I’m on the ground before I even register the impact, and something knocks my flashlight away, spinning it out of my grip to *crack* against the wall—plunging the basement into blackness.

\*\*\*

“Your plan is DANGEROUS!!” Raging at me from across the greasy table, Emma threw her hands up. “This is *just* like when we broke up! You caught in paranormal bullshit and *insisting* on playing the hero. Classic Jack! ‘Oh, I have to do this alone, Emma, in the most reckless and insanely stupid way possible’—fucking macho bullcrap!”

“It’s *not* macho bullcrap—”

“Then why not let me come down with you?”

“BECAUSE I’M A COWARD, EMMA!” I slammed my hands on the table. “Because *last* time you and I were facing the paranormal, remember what happened? Because *I* remember and I was NOT fucking heroic.” She flinched. I’d never yelled at her before. I clenched my jaw and dialed myself down. “I’m like a cockroach—very fast, hard to kill, at my best in the gutter crawling through the dark, so just… Let me do the *one* thing I always do—which is be selfish and *run.*”

And there it is, folks.

Cowardly? Let’s call that wisdom! Lion or jackal, baby? Always the jackal! Until now, I’ve been spinning my cowardice into an asset—it’s what I do as a conman, I spin stuff, I lie. Like the whole time I’m not hating myself for the truth: that I betrayed her. This brilliant, beautiful girl. I sold her out when the demon that marked me came for me and I told it to take Emma instead of me—"[take her](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1czp6lp/i_met_this_guy_im_really_into_but_i_think_he/),” I said.

That’s not just failing to save the princess. That’s throwing her into the maw of the fucking dragon so I wouldn’t get eaten.

That’s why we broke up.

So, ever since I lost Sophie below, I’ve been wondering… what *really* happened down there? Did I try to save the kid? Abandon her? Ditch her so I could preserve my own precious skin? I don’t fucking know, and so I’ve been throwing myself down into the dark, over and over and over….

\*\*\*

In the blackness, I can’t see the face hovering above mine, but I can *taste* its breath, like a gust out of a catacombs. “Jaaaaack,” it hisses, so close, it’s either gonna bite me or kiss me.

*Um Jack, WHY* *are you imagining making out with it?*

I blame tropes for priming my brain and also because any closer and we’ll lock lips… And now I can’t turn off the mental image of sucking face with it.

My nightmare. This is my nightmare.

Meanwhile my mouth is motoring: “I’m gonna give you what I promised! You’ll be free. You can feast on everyone. The whole world!” *Wait,* what *now?* I should probably rein in my mouth, but it keeps running: “I don’t care who you eat just don’t hurt me, please! We had a deal—probably, I can’t remember, but—just promise you’ll spare my friends and I’ll let you out! Promise to spare us, and she’ll break the wards! That’s what you want, right?”

The withered limbs might as well be iron girders pinning me to the floor, and I can only imagine how powerful it must have been when it was first sealed here, before all those decades starving…

A waft of cold, rotten breath, ASMRing in my ear: “Promissssse…”

Its speech ends in an inhalation. It shudders and takes a long sniff of my neck—and its tongue snakes out across the blood on my throat. Oh God… please don’t let this interview with the vampire go how I think it’s gonna go…

It licks me again (yuck)… and then it releases me.

I quickly scramble backwards.

In the distance, a flicker of light from the top of the stairs, and Emma shouts: “Jack! Everything all right?”

“*BREAK THE WARDS!!!*” I holler.

“Are you sure?”

OMFG—“*YES I’m fucking sure!*” Why is she hesitating?? Dracula here is *thirsty* and I am the only nearby drink, hurry up before he changes his mind about having a jack n’ coke, minus the coke!

The light dims. And then, the atmosphere shifts. The tingling along my skin lightens. It’s like there was a symphony of cicadas and crickets, but the cicadas all went silent—leaving only the crickets chirping their tingling tune on my flesh. And then–*Ping! Ping!* My phone! It’s receiving messages! Which means the warding is *broken.* The chills skittering along my body now are from the entity, and with that prickling of my flesh, a deep dread curdles in my gut. 

“*Hehehe*…”

The low chuckle sends the hairs on my neck on end, and I whirl. The voice seems to come from everywhere and nowhere:

“Too bad you’re *hersss*…”

The brush of a fingernail on my arm. The torn sleeve of my leather jacket exposes the tattoo of a smiling woman on that arm, left by the [demon](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15wmuwv/i_have_a_million_dollars_and_one_week_to_live_how/) that marked me. Her ink is a claim on my life, like a cattle rancher’s brand. She’ll kill me soon, will feed on my screams when she makes a meal of me. But until then, if any other entity poaches me, they risk bringing down the wrath of my rightful “owner”—that’s what it means to be marked.

Pros and cons, amirite?

But even as I feel myself ease, the nails click away from my ink to my locket, and it whispers, “Miiiiine.”

It’s gone between one heartbeat and the next.

Emma. It’s going for Emma.

\*\*\*

“God, you’re so… so…” Ever since walking into the diner, Emma’d been so fucking angry. It threw me, honestly. Even when we broke up, even after my unforgivable betrayal, she’d never been so hostile. “WHY,” she burst, “is it *always* fucking about you?” She dragged her hands through her hair. “Have you ever, even *once*, stopped to ask yourself how it felt for *me,* not knowing if you’re dead or alive? And if you didn’t need my help with the wards, you would’ve gone down there with your dumb reckless plan, could’ve died down there with the sisters, and I’d never even know! Can you even imagine how pissed you’d be, how fucking hurt if it were *me,* Jack, if I went and died somewhere, and you didn’t know if I were alive or dead until someone found my decomposing body? You’re not a coward, but you *are* a fucking asshole!”

She abruptly stalked away from the table, her back to me, shoulders shaking. And finally it hit me why she didn’t want me going down. That she wasn’t angry, but *hurt.* Deeply hurt because of all these weeks I’d dropped out of contact. That she was scared of losing me.

(This is probably a “Duh” moment for readers. Fine. Have at me in the comments.)

I assumed she’d moved on. Her Instagram, her Snapchat and social media—she looked happy. Out with friends. Living her life. The way she’s supposed to. I didn’t want her knowing where or when I’d die. I can’t outrun the claim on me forever. I thought by removing myself—completely cutting myself out of her life—I was setting her free.

I reached for her. “I thought you would forget me.”

She clung to me tightly, and I inhaled the scent of her skin as all those old feelings ignited. Emma’s fingers dug into me like she couldn’t decide between wanting to hold me forever or let go and strangle me. “No, you idiot,” she whispered. “I never forgot you.”

\*\*\*

Now, in that split second between one heartbeat and the next as the thing disappears, it hits me that it might not actually be me who dies first. That maybe I miscalculated. And that maybe—no, no, nonononono—

“EMMA!!!” I scream as I run toward the stairs. “RUN, EMMA, RUN, RUN—” The cans! The cans all clatter, and I shriek, “—*NOW!!!*”

I’m nearly as fast as the entity. So desperate, I’m all but flying, racing past those rolling cans. But I’m too late—the trapdoor slams down above me—

—trapping me in [darkness.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
