I am very well aware how this sound, and I don’t blame you for not believing me and brushing this story aside, but I assure that I’m speaking the truth, I have killed someone, more than once actually, it’s just an “itch” I have to scratch once in a while.

They’re usually tourists, beggars, loners, people whose disappearence won’t raise much suspicion in our quaint little town, but this time was a bit different.

There was this little troublemaker that moved here recently with his mother a couple of month ago.

I had my eyes on them for a while, but we first spoke during the local Owlman festival that our community hosts every summer, It’s the ideal place to meet new people,  after all cryptids are great to attracts tourists or to take the blame for sudden disappearences.

His mother, Carol, a red headed, frail woman with deep bags under her eyes, approached my stand with a tray of hand made biscuits, while her son lazily following her around while brooding.

“Good morning! We haven’t met yet, I’m Carol Greene your new neighbor and this my son Cody, we just move here yesterday and we wanted to greet everyone with my fabolous chocolate cookies”

Cody rolled his eyes as she leaned forward, inviting me to indulge in her cousine.

“Mmm, don’t mind if I do….oh wow, compliments to the chef, my I take one more?”

In reality I tasted far better, but people tend to lower their guard when you tell them what they want to hear.

“Why of course!” She exclaimed enthusiastically

“I see you’re selling home made soap, how much do you charge for them?”

“Oh it’s on the house this time, consider it a thanks for the cookies, say, where is your house exactly?

“Oh we live at the end of this road, my cousin used to live there but, he left town out of nowhere one day without saying a word to anyone….”

“Oh yeah, I’m sorry to hear that, I never knew the guy that well you know, he was kind of a hermit”

“Ufff…. tell me about it, I just wish he would’ve at least told me where he was going but…”

Realizing I poked a sensitive subject I decided to lighten up the mood a little bit introducing myself

“Well Pleasure to meet Mr., see Cody you should learn a thing or two from this kind young man, now come on! Let’s greet the others!”

As she happily trottled away to the next stand, I couldn’t help but noticed how her son was looking at me

I could see it in his eyes, that kid was going to be trouble, the kind nobody wants anything to do with, my kind of trouble.

And soon enough that very night a rock broke through my window, almost landed on my head too.

But I wasn’t mad, on the contrary I hoped he would do worse, and he did not disappoint

In the span of a month, Cody Greene became our town’s biggest brat.

Bullying, vandalizing, a bit of stealing, the boy was a menace and his mom was a desperate single mom struggling to control her problem child.

They wouldn’t be missed

Finally one day Cody pushed himself a bit too far, punching another teen so hard their front teeth fell off, and that teen just happened to be the mayor’s son.

“My Dad will kick you and your bitch mum out of town” he said trying to act tough

You should have seen Cody’s face when he realized who he had just messed with, he dashed into the woods like his life depended on it.

Unfortunately for him, I was there

It wasn’t hard to track him down, I’ve dealt with much bigger and faster prey before, though he did go quite far into the woods, even further than I ever dared to.

Most people avoid venture into the deep forest, they say a beast called the Owlman haunts its dark depth.

I’m not a superstition person, I’ve been there so many times now that I can safely assure that there is no such thing as the Owlman, however after what happened after I returned from my hunt, I can safely say that there are some things hidden among the trees that cannot be explained.

I found Cody sitting beneath a pine tree, his head in his hands holding back tears

“Am I interrupting something?”

I asked jockingly 

Cody jumped back in shock and tried to stand back up

“Hey, relax big man, it’s not like I’m the Owlman or anything”

“The fuck are you doing here creep”

“Your mom asked me to find you, it’s not safe to stay in the wild when it’s dark outside you know?”

“I-I would’ve found the way back on my own!”

“I doubt that kiddo, you need plenty of experience to navigate these woods”

I could tell he wouldn’t trust me that easily

“You know I was just like you growing up, I stirred up all sort of trouble around town, just to get to that overbearing bitch of my mom…”

For a moment I saw a shimmer of sympathy in his eyes

“At least she cared more than my dad…”

“W-why what did he do?”

The fish had grabbed the bait, all I had to do was reeling it in

“He left us both without a warning, we never got an explaination for it, he just…. had enough of us.”

We stood there quietly for a moment, there’s nothing better than silence to make your words more impactfull

“Lashing out against others won’t change a thing, if you want to feel better you need to BE better, make friends, have fun, that’s what’s it all about, you have your all life ahead of you, don’t waste it trying to get back at a world’s that’s too big too care, and even if your mother seems obsessive and overbearing it’s because she deeply loves you not because she wants to control you”

Cody looked at me in shock, his eyes started to water again.

Suddenly he lunged at me at full force and wrapped his arms around my chest, dripping tears and snot all over my new jacket 

Begrudgingly I hug him back as tightly as I could.

We stayed like that for at least 30 minutes, and I was getting impatient 

“Your mom must be worried sick kid, we better get going, come on my car isn’t that far ahead.”

I wrapped my arm around his shoulders as we walked keeping up the charade of care and effection was essential for the final act.

After he finally set foot in the car, I waited his emotional stress to take its toll, it didn’t took long, in just another half an hour he fell fast asleep.

At that point his mother must’ve already allerted the police of his disappearence so I had very limited time to get rid of him

When we stopped at my burial ground I gently nudged him to wake him up, it wouldn’t be fair if they don’t even get a chance to fight back.

Before Cody could ask where we were or what was going on, I already had my mask on and my hands around his throat 

And after a quick uneventful struggle, with a rapid snap, he fell limp against the car door, tears still streaming down his face.

I already prepared his hole in advance and after a shoveling a bit of dirt onto him, Cody Greene was just going to be another body added to the pile and I’ll forget he’ll ever existed after a couple of weeks

Or so I thought

A couple of days had path and due to the reputation Cody had made for himself, people weren’t too keen of finding him

His mother was an inconsolable mess, and despite his son’s action the entire community did it’s best to console her, to no avail.

I decided to let her fester a bit before taking her out, after all it would’ve raised too much suspicion to have them both disappear in a matter of days

But things didn’t go as planned

As I was cleanin my car today I heard Carol laugh, could she have gone insane before I could take her out?

But as I looked down the street I saw her hugging someone, I saw her hugging her son

I felt a chill down my spine as I watched him enter his house, and I felt a sense of nausea so strong it almost made me fall to my knees.

How could it be, I snapped his neck like a twig, threw him in a 6 ft. deep hole in the middle of nowhere and covered him with pounds and pounds of dirt.

Never in my life I saw someone come back alive from my bureal ground and it won’t happen this time.

Has anyone ever experienced something at least partially similar to this? Did anyone heard of people disappearing and coming back different? Do you have any suggestion on how to solve this matter?
