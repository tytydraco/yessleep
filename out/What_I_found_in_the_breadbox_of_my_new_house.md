Hi Reddit! My husband David and I managed to snag up a little place out in the Aussie bush right before the prices went wild.


It's a really cool property with tonnes of bushland and a few fields for farming. There are some old structures and things on the property but we haven't had too close a look yet as they're all burned up. The main house was in quite the state when we got it too. We got pretty lucky in an estate sale and "work from home" hadn't quite become permanent at this stage in the housing game which is how we scored so well.


We had to wait for the tradies to be done with the debris clean, repairs, and renovations (let me tell you, they weren't joking about the timber shortage. Bloody hell!), and then the second cleaners and pest guys. It was worth the wait though.


We've just started moving in all of our stuff (Dale has a LOT of stuff!) and now while my husband is at work, I've got the lovely duty of finding places for all our things (except our wedding photos. The walls look SO good with their fresh coat of paint that I'm hesitant about driving in a nail!) 


Sorry, I ramble. The point is: I've finally had the chance to rummage through the cupboards and see if we got any cool things left behind from the other owners. With two sets of cleaners coming through, I wasn't expecting anything. The kitchen has a cute little breadbox though, and I guess it didn't need to be touched up too badly. I was giving the kitchen an antibacterial wipedown before putting plates and things away (with so many contractors in and about I wanted to be safe!) and taped on the roof of the breadbox I found the weirdest note.


It might just be a prank but I know that you guys love weird stuff, so I've transcribed what I can from the note below: 


Mum. I know we havent spoken since the wedding but please I need your help. I cant go to Kara anymore. Dad is doing better and I don't want to put him on a backtrack.


I know you're still mad that I included dad in my speech when I thanked youse both for giving me and Lara the house. It was still his house to (sic). I know what he put us through. I know he was the reason you sent me to live with Nan. I still wanna love my dad.


That doesnt mean that me and Clarissa dont think you havent been good to us. She always says since we been together that you were a fucken tuff cookie (sic). I just wanted to leave you some notes for when you sell this place after i go. Sorry if i dont see your face again.


Since youse, mostly you, always visited me at Nans place I dont know whats normal in the house. I thought Id give a list of shit to be fixed:

- Tap always turns on by itself 

- Sometimes the kitchen roof leaks sap or something 

- The porch light turns off if it gets windy -- I think it's the wind because it's when the bushes and trees are shaking mad crazy

- Check the barn for squatters the light keeps turning on at night but it's off when we check in the morning. We keep a lock on it but maybe theres a loose panel

When Christine and me moved in it was all good at first. Everything worked like a dream coz I know you fixed it up before you got the caravan. 


I know you said dad went crazy. BUT It seemed to went (sic) really fast downhill after he took them teeth from when we were up in there in the kitchen roof and found them. I though about that day. He went for a walk and went right into the roof.



Do you remember? You started ringing doctors around that time. He told me someone he saw in the bush said to check the roof. So if he was just sick he wouldnt of (sic) found anything? He found those teeth wrapped in the cloth. Remember? Little animal teeth and you said to chuck them out and they were nothing. Someone would of (sic) wrapped them though? 


A window got broken right after that and you blamed me saying I was a problem. I know you were scared dad was forgetting you and all of that but now I have to tell you it really wasnt me. The hole in the wall when you were with dad at the doctors wasnt me. It couldnt have been dad. He was with you. I think I get it. I know WE didnt see anyone in the bush but guess what? Klara went for a bushwalk a few months back.


I only put it together recently but a few days after that she told me to check in the roof. I think she saw whoever dad did. She didnt seem scared. After that is when all the shit started breaking. I know Angela didn't do it. I probably sound like him and that could give you the creepies (sic) like you (unintelligible - "always said he" maybe?) did. 


WE FOUND BONES!!!!!!! SMALL BONES!!!! IN WHITE CLOTH LIKE WHAT I REMEMBER THE TEETH!!!! I had them on the table then they werent there and not in the roof when I rechecked!!! 


We cant stay here. Paris has not been home. She says she cant handle me when I'm like this. I dont know what that means. She said I gave her a bruise that I apparently choked her I DID NOT GIVE HER A BRUISE. I THINK I WOULD OF (sic) REMEMBERED CHOKING MY (can't figure this part out) WIFE!! I AM NOT ON DRUGS. I DO NOT DRINK. IM NOT A FUCKING WOMAN BASHER THATS FUCKED!!!!!! I LOVE MY WIFE AND I WANTED THAT IN WRITINT (sic) BECAUSE IM FUCKING PISSED OFF!!!  SO TONIGHT IM GOING TO THE FUCKING SHED WHEN THE LIGHT COMES ON. IF THAT SQUATTING PRICK HAS HURT LAURA I WILL FUCKING CLOCK HIM SO SHE KNOWS I WOULD NEVER LAY A FUCKING FINGER ON HER! I. LOVE. ADELYNNE. FOR. FUCKING. EVER.


So thats why I write because it's that fuckhead or me. Whoever is in there keeps flicking the lights on and off like they wanna fucking go so lets go


Mum I love you. I love Daisy. When she comes back from where ever (sic) she went tell her that if I don't come back let her remarry. I love you and it takes a lot for you to not get a devorce (sic) when dad went like that but I just want her to be happy. I have enough money from the mines to set her up real nice. 


It ends.

Love Grayson.

[End of letter] 

So there you go, Reddit. Pre-emptively: The realestate laws in my state (Queensland) are a bit iffy when it comes to what has to be disclosed. "Material facts" must be disclosed if they'd make the buyer change their mind, and we've had cases where someone later found out their house was a murder house and got their deposit back/out of their contract. However, since we got this in an estate sale, I don't think we'd really have a case for not knowing the nitty gritty of what happened.


Additionally, the buildings that I can see from the house are all burned out (could have been vandalism from when the property was on the market. It was like that when we inspected it. Just didn't bother to renovate yet since we don't need it). 


Anyway, sorry for the long post. Daniel will be back from his bushwalk soon so I better get back to it before he gets his hands on the home decor and I get a lecture on my collection of throw pillows. 


Dylan's been out here since the sale. Sometimes he went for a gander at the rest of the property ("exploring the wilderness" he'd call it, even though his Runescape days are long behind him!) Other times he'd help the tradies (when they let him, lol!). Unfortunately, after they replaced some roof stuff above the kitchen he managed to get hurt pretty badly and we promised not to sue (since it was his fault!) but they wouldn't let him help anymore. He still kept going out to the property though. Probably just to "explore the wilderness".


Off topic but since this subreddit gets way more traffic than some of the others, I thought I'd just ask here in case there are any doctors lurking: Shay's accident with the roof got his arms a bit sore/scratched and banged up his knee. I'm trying to get him to see a doctor because he's got this bruise that sort of wraps around his neck but he isn't worried because he didn't hit his head, neck, or chest. I'm alarmed, but if someone can let me know if I should try harder to get Vince alarmed (and to a doctor!!) I'd be forever grateful.


We really love it out here. The air is fresh. The mornings are new... And I am so excited for what comes next.
