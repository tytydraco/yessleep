I was 7-years old when this happened. I'd like to think I'm just misremembering, that something more scientifically plausible happened instead. I hope so. I've read stories where characters had lifelike dreams they truly thought were real, but I've also read stories where something obviously real and strange happens yet the main character still stupidly convinces themself it was a dream. Back then, I knew the difference between dreaming and being awake. I felt very much awake, for whatever that's worth.

I used to believe in God. I don't know what I believe anymore, but as a kid I followed my family's faith. I was pretty good about it, believing and praying and all that, but I could never shake the feeling that God was seeing everything I did, judging me anyway. I'd stay up late some nights worrying about what he'd say and do once I reached heaven. I know he's supposed to be this divine being without a body, but as a kid I imagined him as a disembodied, ethereal head with flowing, tendril-like hair, hanging up in the clouds. I'd space out in class a lot and see him in the rolling clouds, imagining strands of his tentacle-hair holding brushes, painting heaven and earth into existence.

One day in July 1997, I was at my grandparents' apartment while my parents were out. I was sitting with my grandmother on the balcony, playing with my Tamagotchi while she read a book. She must've had to go do something because she left me on the balcony alone. It had an ornate, greyish-tan, concrete railing. I was too small to see above it, but I could still peer through the slats between the bars. We were on the 7th floor so we had a good view of the area, all the houses and familiar streets and trees at the forefront, all the mountains and electrical towers further out from the city. There was also a bird's nest on the awning above the balcony door, and at some point whatever bird that lived there had returned, so I watched it. I remember thinking how pretty it looked in the pink sunset.

When I felt the first tremors, my instincts assumed it was an earthquake, that some supervillain had set off a bomb somewhere, that the building was collapsing. But through the railing I saw nothing scary below, no cracks in the earth or rubble falling off the complex. Just people going about their day, oblivious. I called for my grandparents through the screen door, but neither of them responded. The bird flew off behind the building.

When I looked back out through the railing into the horizon, I swear a new mountain stood in the distance.

It wasn't like the other mountains. It was all wrong. Asymmetrical, bulky at the bottom and top but caving inward towards the middle, pitch black, with jagged, curving shapes poking out of the peak like dead trees. It blended in well enough through the distant, dim afternoon haze. I honestly doubted myself for a bit, trying to convince myself that the new, weird mountain had always been there, and I had simply never noticed.

But it moved towards me, its base shifting forward from one side and then another like a person walking in a floor-length dress, sluggish like wading through water. Hulking arms lifted from its sides, letting the sky in through the gaps they left. Each step shook the world. I wanted to scream for my grandparents, my parents, the neighbours, but I didn't. I didn't run back into the apartment either. I still don't know why. Science can probably explain it. It can probably explain all of it.

The thing got closer and closer, its shadow spilling onto the roof, its body obscuring the setting sun. It phased through all the buildings and cars and telephone poles and people like it wasn't fully there. One dark, beady, eye-like shape near the top shifted and looked down at me with a white, pinprick pupil. It groaned like grinding metal even without a mouth, and came to a stop in front of the apartment. 

I remember feeling like my parents were mad at me for drawing on the walls with crayons, that same mixture of fear and shame and unavoidable knowing, but a million times worse. Like the universe stood before me and loathed every cell in my body for existing.

The thing lowered its head. When its eye reached balcony level, my reflection shone back at me, and I just knew I was going to die. I was going to die, forever, and whatever happened after, this thing was going to be there, hating me the whole while.

The protrusions on its head writhed, flexing in my direction. One wormed its way down quicker than the rest, destroying a chunk of the balcony, then grabbing me and lifting me up by the legs. It hurt in a way I still wince at every other day if I let it, like being touched by the sun but colder than winter. I clung to the intact part of the railing, finally screaming my head off, my limbs straining against the thing's impossible pull.

I still don't understand how, but I blinked only to find myself hanging from the railing, gravity tugging me down, then my grandmother lifting me up. The giant was gone. She asked me what happened, but I couldn't say. I cried a lot. My grandfather showed up from the bedroom afterwards, tired and grouchy, and soon my parents came to pick me up. My grandmother explained how she found me, how there was now a chunk of the balcony missing along with the balcony above. My parents half-cried, half-yelled at her for leaving me alone, then did the same to me, something I never experienced from them again. They asked how I ended up clinging to the outside of the railing. I still don't know how to answer them.

Later in life, I talked about it with my grandparents. As far as the inspector could tell, there had been some structural weakness in one of the upper units' balconies that led to a chunk of it falling off and hitting their own. They had it repaired. I never told them about the massive monster. Both of them are long gone, and my deepest regret is not visiting more often.

I want to believe this was some hallucination or nightmare or faith-fueled something or other that tinted how I saw an otherwise mundane incident, but I've never had a similar experience since, and I'll never, ever forget how I felt. I'll never forget each colossal footfall reverberating through my skull and rattling my teeth, the monster that stood taller than a skyscraper and absorbed every hue into its lightless body, the bruises on my legs from how tightly it held me, every colour of the rainbow splattered on my skin, some still staining parts of the restored balcony and surrounding brick.

Now here I am, a 35-year old too terrified to draw or paint or go outside, renting an apartment while wishing desperately I could afford a single story home, with words that are all I have, that no one in their right mind would believe. And the only thing I pray for anymore is that, whatever that being was, it wasn't the God from my daydreams.
