George was always a little weird. He was a small, pale, dishwater blonde, whose love of black vintage clothing made him look like a cross between a vampire and a funeral usher. He would talk, and sometimes sing, to himself in public. He spent most of his time reading, drawing fantasy creatures in his many sketchbooks, and taking long walks around town. But the weirdest thing about him was that he said he could talk to crows.

We met in the third grade. I was the new girl in town, sent from Boston to live with my grandparents while my parents slogged through their messy divorce. I first saw him at recess- a scrawny blond boy dressed in black, sitting in an empty field, surrounded by crows. While the other kids hollered and laughed and ran around the playground, this kid was whispering to no one.

“What are you doing?” I asked him.

“Talking to the crows,” he said, as if it were the most normal thing in the world.

I crossed my arms and glared at him. “You can’t *talk* to crows.”

He turned his head around to look at me. “Most people can’t. But I can.”

“How do you do that?”

The boy smiled, oblivious to my annoyance. “Crows are very smart. Scientists say they have their own language. They have jokes, and different names for each other.”

I squinted at the half dozen black birds milling around the boy. They didn’t look that smart to me. I pointed at one. “What’s that one saying?”

“That’s Percival. He’s sulking because Diana-” he gestured to another crow- “ate the caterpillar he wanted.”

Either this kid was playing an elaborate joke, or he was absolutely cuckoo.

“And that one?” I asked.

“That’s Enoch. He’s an elder.” The boy cocked his head slightly. He had the palest blue eyes I’d ever seen, so pale they were almost white. “He’s sizing you up. Trying to see if you’re a friend or a foe.”

Sure enough, Enoch was staring at me, his head cocked in a manner eerily similar to the boy’s. I’ve rarely been able to discern the slightest emotion from a crow’s beady black eyes, but in that moment I could see it. Curiosity. Suspicion.

“So what, he’s like the leader of the flock?”

“Not flock. A Murder.” 

“What?” 

“A group of crows is called a murder.”

Whether he was cuckoo or not, this boy was proving to be the most interesting person in this boring little town. I sat down on the grass next to him. 

“My name’s Maria,” I said. And there I stayed.

My parents were more interested in dragging out their divorce proceedings than coming back for their own kid, so my temporary stay with my grandparents became permanent. I never quite felt like I belonged anywhere. I never adjusted to leaving the city for a small town. I felt restless, like everything around me was slow and dull and hazy. I was a half-Mexican girl living in a mostly white town with my white grandparents. I was “foreign” enough to elicit stares from the locals, but too American to know how to speak Spanish. I was able to make a few friends, eventually. But George and I, always the odd kids out, became the closest.

I learned pretty quickly that George spent most of his time alone. His parents were social climbers, eager to pretend their weirdo son didn’t exist. Teachers didn’t like him much- he was smart, but his grades were erratic. And he never fit in with the other kids. He was too cheerful for the goths, too quiet for the theater kids, too technologically inept for the geeks and nerds.

Aside from me, his only companions were the crows. He knew every one of the dozens of crows that lived in our town- their names, origins, likes and dislikes. He gave them treats like peanuts and hard boiled eggs. They left him gifts- usually shiny things like coins and bottle caps. When Enoch died, George, the other crows, and I held a funeral where George sobbed for hours. After that, the crows took to following him around whenever he went outdoors. Whenever he went indoors, the crows would gather round the windows, pecking and cawing to get his attention.

“Why are they doing that?” my grandma asked nervously. George was over for dinner and she noticed a few crows pecking at the dining room window.

“Crows can remember human faces,” George said matter-of-factly. “They remember humans who are friends to them, and treat them like members of the group.”

“Can they remember the humans who are jerks to them?” my grandpa joked.

“Yes they can. They’ll tell the other crows about them, and coordinate an attack.”

Grandpa started to laugh, but after seeing George’s serious expression he fell silent.

Shortly after that I noticed the crows following *me* around. Not nearly as many as followed George, and not nearly as often. But there were sometimes a few trailing after me when I went outside. When I told George about it his face split into a smile.

“They know you’re my friend,” he said, “They consider you part of the murder now.”

It was a little unnerving, being tailed by little black birds everywhere I went, but I trusted George. If he thought being followed was a good thing, then he was probably right.

There’s only one event, from before things got so messed up, that stands out in my mind. It was right after I’d gotten my driver’s license and inherited my Grandma’s ancient blue sedan. I was driving into town when I saw George. Now, it wasn’t unusual to see him walking along local roads. But this time, he was standing along the highway, in that thin stretch of grass between the forest and the asphalt, and he was staring at the ground. I pulled over and stepped out of my car to make sure he was okay. 

He didn’t even look up. “Hi, Maria,” he said blandly, “You’re just in time for the feast.”

Before I could reply, I saw what he was looking at.

It was a deer that had been hit by a car. It lay on its side, in a pool of its own blood. Its abdomen was slashed open, and its guts spilled out onto the grass. And there were the crows: tearing out pieces of its flesh, sipping the congealing blood, slurping up its intestines.

Worse still- the deer was still alive. What remained of its abdomen moved up and down in shallow, rapid breaths. Its eyes blinked rapidly. Its head moved groggily, snorting and whimpering as it lay there, being eaten alive. I stared and stared, wishing I could put the deer out of its misery, but too afraid to deal the killing blow.

I realized George had been holding something. It was a baby crow with all white feathers. He was feeding it a piece of the deer’s flesh, staining the crow’s pink beak red.

“This is Lux,” he explained, “The other crows rejected her because of how she looks. So I’m taking care of her. And maybe one day, I can integrate her into the murder.”

I nodded blankly, backed into my car, and drove away.

It was the only truly freaky incident that occurred before the real nightmare. At the time, I put it out of my mind. Crows are scavengers, after all. It was just the circle of life.

The trouble truly began when George started dating Kate. They were apparently introduced at some rich-people function, and hit it off right away. I seemed to be the only person who thought it was creepy that a 22-year-old was dating a high schooler. The average response to my concerns was, “He’ll be 18 in a few months, anyway.”

Beyond that, they had nothing in common. Kate’s family- I’ll call them the Oxfords- were old money New Englanders, the sort that brag about their ancestors coming over on the Mayflower. The Oxfords owned half the businesses in town, which meant we had to treat them like royalty. Kate wasn’t outwardly mean, but she was shallow, bossy, and entitled.

Not that George cared. He was head-over-heels, absolutely smitten. George had never had a girlfriend before. Now the prettiest, richest, most popular woman in town wanted him for herself. Everyone constantly talked about how lucky he was. “Kate’s such an amazing catch!” “She’ll straighten him out in no time!” “It’ll be a fairy tale wedding!” “He won’t have to work a day in his life!” By graduation, George was spending almost all of his spare time with Kate. I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised when I received their wedding invitation at the end of the summer.

I didn’t enjoy the wedding- it looked like it was curated for Kate’s Pinterest account, and Kate made it pretty clear that she didn’t want me there. But George seemed happy, and despite my misgivings, I came to support him. Although we had nice weather, Kate opted for an indoor wedding. I heard her tell a bridesmaid it was because “those stupid birds won’t leave us alone.”

 I took a gap year, waiting tables at a local restaurant to raise money for college. After the wedding, I began to see George less and less. Every time I called him, he had a different reason for why he couldn’t hang out: he wasn’t feeling well, he and Kate were going on vacation, he was seeing his parents. He didn’t go for walks anymore, either. By winter, I mostly saw him whenever he stopped by the liquor store next to the restaurant. These liquor store runs were becoming alarmingly frequent.

I found excuses to drive by his house. George and Kate had moved into one of the Oxfords’ many houses- a Victorian mansion at the very edge of town, about a mile away from the nearest neighbor. It was what rich people called “rustic” and the rest of us called “rundown.” Its whitewash and green shutters were peeling. Its driveway, more gravel than pavement, seemed ill suited for Kate’s shiny new Lexus. The house was surrounded by thin strips of yard before giving way to the woods.

But what struck me most of all, was that every time I went there, there were dozens of crows surrounding the house. They flew onto the roof and pecked the dirt in the front yard. They knocked on the windows and perched in the surrounding trees. Sometimes their cawing was unbearably loud. But most of the time they were just silent. As if they were watching. Waiting.

I could only assume they were waiting for George. Occasionally I would see him staring out the window, with glass of wine in his hand and a blank expression on his face. Despite his many friends waiting for him outside, and despite me waving to him from my car window, he would never come out.

As winter gave way to a damp and chilly spring, I realized I had to do something. The next time I saw George at the liquor store, I ran out of the restaurant to see him.

He didn’t look good at all. His fair skin had a sickly grayish tinge. He had lost weight, his figure barely visible under his baggy sweatshirt. His eyes had an empty, unfocused look, and his breath reeked of wine. He swayed slightly when he walked, and hardly seemed to notice the crows gathering around him.

I’ll admit I initially ambushed him with questions: “Are you okay? Are you sick? Where have you been?” He had trouble keeping up, only mumbling short replies. 

But when I asked him, “Why are you avoiding me?,” he went quiet and looked away.

“George?”

No answer.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-”

“I’m not allowed to have female friends,” he blurted.

“Not allowed?” I sputtered, “Says who?”

“Kate. It’s not your fault, Maria. You’ve been great. But I- I’ve been a bad husband, and Kate wanted to set boundaries. I just need some more time- she’ll come around. This- this is all my fault!”

I couldn’t believe this. So Kate was the problem. Something was wrong. Something was deeply, terribly, dangerously wrong.

“I have to go,” he said, “If she finds out I talked to you-”

“Don’t!” I cried. George flinched, so I softened my tone. “We have to talk more. When can I see you again?”

He thought for a moment. “The park. 6 pm tomorrow. Where no one can see us.”

“Deal. Just… be safe George. Look out for yourself. Please.”

George didn’t reply, just stumbled down the street with his bottles of wine and a line of crows trailing behind him.

The next evening I waited for George at a bench in the far corner of the park. The sun was setting rapidly, painting the two of us in blazing oranges, and later velvety blues. George looked better- at least, he was steady on his feet. He wore a huge pair of sunglasses in spite of the fading light.

The crows gathered around us. I couldn’t tell if they were listening in, or keeping watch. The white crow found her way to the bench and snuggled into George’s arms, where he gave her gentle head scratches.

“Lux is doing so well now,” he said, “The other crows just made her an elder. I’m so proud of her."

I tried to make small talk. Had he read any books lately? Had he made any cool drawings? Found any new vintage clothes? No, no, and no. As the sun sank lower in the sky, I asked him why he kept his sunglasses on.

He hesitated for a minute, then said, “Please don’t freak out.” He removed the sunglasses to reveal a massive bruise. It was stark against his pale skin, a sickly purple spreading across the left side of his face and around one reddened eye.

“Jesus Christ! What happened to you?”

“It’s all my fault,” he mumbled. “One of Kate’s friends saw us together. Kate was crying and so upset… she didn’t mean this. And she won’t do it again. She promised.”

“Bullshit!” I snapped. “Kate’s got you trapped in that old mansion. And now she’s hurting you! She’ll find a reason to do it again, no matter what.”

A line of tears was emerging from his bad eye, and tracing a path down his mottled cheek. “I don’t… I don’t know what to do.”

I took his cold hand in mine. “You have to leave. As soon as you can.”

He wasn’t looking at me. He was look out at the dozens of crows surrounding us. “I can’t. She’ll come after me. You don’t know what sort of connections the Oxfords have.”

“I’ll help you. You just have to try!”

He sniffled. “She’ll find me and kill me.”

“Please!” I insisted. How could I make him see?

I gestured outwards. “Ask the crows! Do they want you to leave Kate?”

George was silent for a few minutes. He was cocking his head, listening. I strained for follow their silent conversation, but I couldn’t understand anything. The crows’ black eyes were as cold and empty as ever. Lux looked up at George and croaked softly.

“Yes,” George said, “They say I should leave.”

I did everything I could to help George. I told my grandparents everything. They believed me, but were too scared of the Oxfords to help. I tried to tell George’s parents, but they hung up on me mid-sentence. They saw George’s marriage as their ticket to high society, and wouldn’t do anything to jeopardize it. I even called the local police. After I could get the deputy who answered to stop laughing and hand the phone over, the chief scolded me for “spreading baseless rumors about a good girl from a good family.” In the end, it was up to myself and George.

Our plan was simple. We’d wait for when Kate was out of the house. George would throw a few clothes and some valuables in a backpack and sneak out through the back door. I would wait for him, parked about 300 feet away. I couldn’t risk driving up to his house; George said the maid was instructed to phone Kate whenever my car drove past. Once George got into my car, we’d drive out of town, to Boston or even further.

One evening Kate went out to have dinner with her parents. George stayed behind, claiming illness. I drove my crappy blue sedan to our agreed-upon spot, and sat on the hood waiting for George to arrive. It was one of those evenings that was too cloudy for a proper sunset. Instead, the sky shifted from white to dark gray, and the shadows deepened. It was still early spring, and my sweatshirt did little to shield me from the wind. A handful of crows perched on my car, as if they were waiting for George, too.

My stomach was tying itself into knots. I found myself jumping at the rustling branches and scuttling animals. The woods loomed all around me, dark branches stretching miles high and creeping towards my tiny little car. It wasn’t just the fear of being caught that was winding me up. I mean- what the hell was I doing? Here I was, about to throw away everything I’d ever known- my grandparents, my job, college- to run off with some guy? 

But George wasn’t just some guy. This was the guy with the sweet smile, who was kind to everyone he met, no matter how nasty they were in return. Who refused to be frightened by death and decay, who loved mushrooms and bones the same way others loved songbirds and flowers. He could look at a deer in its death throes without flinching. He was the guy who could talk to crows.

And to think about him now- sickly, bruised, drunk and alone- was enough to break my heart right in two. How was it that every time I saw him looking out the manor window, I failed to see the prison bars? He was dying, dying of abuse and loneliness, and only I could save him. He was my best friend, perhaps my only true friend. He would have done the same for me.

George arrived with his backpack and a murder of crows in tow. His skin was ghostly white- the yellow splotch of his fading bruise was very noticeable. He was practically shaking with nerves. 

“Are you okay, George?”

“Terrified, but okay,” he stammered.

I tried to smile but failed miserably. “So am I. Let’s go.”

Before either of us could get into my car, we were interrupted by the sound of screeching tires. A shiny Lexus swerved towards us, barely missing my car and sending crows scattering. From the open window we could hear an enraged shriek. Kate had come home early.

In the few seconds Kate stayed in the driver’s seat, screaming obscenities at us, I came to a chilling realization. How it must have looked to jealous Kate, leaving home for a few hours only to find her unfaithful husband, backpack in hand, about to get into the car of his female friend. I almost felt sorry for her. 

My sympathy evaporated when her designer handbag came flying out the window. It struck George on the forehead, sending his small frame crumpling to the ground. Kate threw open the door and launched herself at George. She straddled him, pinning him to the ground as she rained blows on his face and arms. I could make out a few words- “cheating bastard,” “Mexican whore,” “how could you do this to me,” mixed with George’s sobs and wailed apologies.

I threw myself at Kate, hoping to pull her off, and was met with an elbow to the face. I stumbled backwards, blood pouring out of my crushed nose.

Kate was still beating George. His sobs were getting quieter and weaker, while her screams were unrelenting. Her face was unrecognizable, with a snarling open mouth and rolling eyes. Gone was the poised heiress with the polished car and fancy handbag. This was the true Kate, a wild animal, a howling demon, the monster who had kept George locked away.

She would kill him. If not now, then later, after she had dragged him away. I wanted to do something, anything, but I lay frozen on the pavement. The blood from my nose was running down my throat, and the metallic taste gave me the powerful urge to vomit. Pain was pulsing through my face and spreading outwards with each heartbeat.

Then I saw them. The crows. Dozens. Hundreds. More than I ever thought lived in this forest. They flew in a circle, their black bodies stark against the dark gray sky. Their caws grew louder and louder. And they were getting closer, spiraling towards the three of us, centering us in the eye of a tornado.

A flash of white dashed into the center of the circle. Lux. She landed on Kate’s shoulder and began pecking at her face. Kate tried to shake her off, but it didn’t work. Lux’s pecking turned to jabbing, which turned to stabbing. Kate stood up and tried to pull Lux off., but that only made things easier for Lux. She sank her pink beak into Kate’s eye, impervious to her screams. 

The other crows soon descended on Kate, tearing the flesh away from her face, her neck, her hands. One crow ripped out chunks of her hair. Another tore out her fingernails, one by one. Kate’s screams became bloodcurdling: “HELP ME! GEORGE! HEEEELLLLP MEEEEE!” But the cawing became even louder, so deafening I had to cover my ears. The crows drowned her out completely. Before long, I couldn’t see Kate anymore, just a writhing mass of black birds. 

George had gotten to his feet. I could tell from his slack expression that this was beyond his control. His eyes were so pale and so wide, I could see the swirling circle of crows reflected in each of them. 

I fought the panic rising in my chest, knowing that I was the one who had to act. I grabbed his hand. “George!”

He stood there motionless, mouth open. Watching them. 

I pulled harder. “We have to go! Now!”

That shook him out of it. We didn’t stop, not even to pick up George’s bag. We ran to my car and slammed the doors shut. I floored the gas pedal, drove as fast as the old car would allow, didn’t stop until we were well into town and the caws were too far away to hear. 

We pulled into a parking lot and sat in silence for a few minutes, trying to catch our breath. Sweat and blood dripped down my chin. George struggled to dial 911 with trembling hands. When I could finally loosen my grip on the steering wheel, I stumbled out of the car, fell to my knees, and screamed.

I never got to see what was left of Kate after the crows were done with her. George and I spent the night in the hospital, and the Oxfords held a closed casket funeral. The most I learned came from overhearing my grandpa talking to his friend on the police force. According to him, the only way the police recognized Kate was from her driver’s license. They found it in the designer handbag lying on the road beside her. The local paper reported Kate’s death as “a possible bear attack,” but word got around. Everyone knew it was George’s crows.

After George was released from the hospital, he spent the night with me and my grandparents. We were both too shaken to sleep, so we stayed up late talking. Around midnight, Lux started pecking at the window, holding a gift in her mouth.

I should have been more freaked out about seeing a crow again, but I somehow knew that neither she nor any other crow would hurt me.

George opened the window and greeted Lux with a smile. Her white feathers were still reddish brown, from blood hadn’t quite washed off. In her mouth was a human finger. It was missing a fingernail, but it wore a very familiar wedding ring.

George thanked Lux and slipped the finger into his pocket. When he turned to me, his pale blue eyes had regained some of their past brightness, his smile warmer despite his bruised face. Perhaps he took the gift as a sign of the crows’ true devotion. Or perhaps he could finally believe that Kate was truly dead. Either way, I was glad to have him back.

I never asked George what he did with the gift. I cared about him a lot, but there were some things I didn’t- and still don’t- want to know.

That was over a year ago. George and I are both going to college in Boston. I live in an apartment near campus, but George chooses to commute.

The people in town still avoid him, but for different reasons. People cross the street if they see him coming. Waiters frantically apologize for the slightest mistakes. If a little kid tries to approach him, a parent will quickly pull them away. 

Maybe it’s not him they’re scared of, but the crows. They still follow him everywhere. Whenever I visit town, they follow me, too. I don’t mind. Oddly enough, I feel safer with them around.

Sometimes I ask George why he doesn’t move away. Escape the Oxfords who shun him, the close-minded neighbors who fear him. Start over somewhere new. But he always refuses.

He doesn’t want to leave the crows behind.
