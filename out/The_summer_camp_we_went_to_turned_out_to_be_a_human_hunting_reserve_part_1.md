My name is Emma, and it's been six years since I last shared my story. No one believed me, but I was there, I saw what happened, what they did to us. I'll never forgive them.

I'll divide the text into two fonts. The plain text is the testimony of my experience, *while the italicized text is my comment as I reflect on my experience.*

It was June 29, 2018, when we drove deep into that godforsaken forest. Dad was behind the wheel, chatting cheerfully with Mom. We followed a slow line of vans and cars—other parents dropping off their kids.

Jacob, my little brother, had just driven his switch to zero battery and was now excitedly bouncing up and down in his seat as we neared the campsite. I just stared lazily out the window, bored out of my mind, playing with my fidget cube.

*I was 17 at that time, and Jacob was 11. My parents divorced when I was 11, and they remarried that year after reigniting their lost flame. Looking forward to their second honeymoon, they dropped me and Jacob off at Oakhill Grove—much to my dismay, in contrast with Jacob who was excited.*

The trees pressed closer as the car pulled up to a wide clearing where a large wooden sign read *Welcome to Oakhill Grove!* in cheerful, chipped paint. Cars filled the lot, parents and kids spilling out, gathering near the entrance to sign in and collect their camp t-shirts.

Oakhill Grove, what a weird name.

Jacob practically bounced with excitement, his backpack swinging wildly. "Come on, Emma! It's gonna be awesome!"

I crossed my arms, squinting at my surroundings—nothing but trees as far as the eye can see for miles all around. "Yeah. Awesome, if you like mosquito bites, bears, drowning, moths, caterpillars, snakes," I blabbered on.

Mom shot me a playful glare. "Oh, don't be so dramatic Emma. You're not gonna die."

"Yay. Yippee..." I cheer sarcastically, lacking any semblance of energy.

We retrieved our luggage and everything we needed for the next two months, from the trunk. Approaching  the front desk at the entrance—which were just two long wooden tables pushed together—we were met with the smiling faces of two women, who appeared to be a couple of years older than me, wearing a red version of the camp t-shirt.

"Welcome to Oakhill Grove! May we please have your names?" The first one, tall, slender, her hair hair tucked into a neat bun, regarded us with a cheerful expression.

"Emma," I said hesitantly.

She scribbled it down. "Last name?"

"Ashford."

I could feel Jacob tugging at my hand, urging me to speed up. He couldn't contain his excitement anymore. He was already done with signing up, they already gave him his shirt. Jacob was fast, I'll give him that.

*The counselor continued on with the questions. But, they became stranger.*

"How old are you and when were you born?"

"How much do you weigh?"

"Are you on any medication? Any illnesses we should know about?"

*Okay, maybe that last one wasn't so bad. But it still didn't lessen the uneasiness I felt.*

After answering the line of seemingly innocent questions, we were both given our t-shirts and bid our parents goodbye. I watched my getaway car drive off into the horizon of trees. Yeah, trees, trees, and more trees surrounding us for miles to come. Unlike Jacob, I was never the outdoorsy type.

Jacob tugged on my hand, nearly pulling me off balance—he was that excited. We joined the other campers as the counselors guided us to gather around a wooden stage near the unlit bonfire, which was near the ballfield

A man in his mid-fifties, I think, stepped atop the stage with a megaphone in hand. He greeted us with a cheerful "Good morning campers!" and introduced himself as the camp director, followed by the usual speech about how the camp was built on a foundation of 'education' and 'fun.' After the orientation, we were assigned to our respective cabins. Luckily, family members were allowed to bunk together in the same cabin.

*Now, let me explain just how huge this camp was. I was baffled when I first saw the map.* *It wasn’t just some small patch of land with a couple of cabins, a few buildings, and a fire pit like I’d imagined. No, this place was massive—like, its-own-zip-code hundreds of acres massive. The camp director, Mr. Marshall owned every inch of it, and he clearly didn’t hold back when it came to making the place feel like its own little world.*

*I mean, it seemed right. There were a lot of us that summer, I'm talking* ***hundreds*** *of campers.—the camp didn't hold back on advertising either, that's how Dad found the place.* 

*There was this big lake right in the middle of the camp, Surrounding the lake were nothing but endless stretches of trees, the kind that seemed to swallow up the trails and made you feel like you were miles away from civilization. On the other side were even more buildings—the gymnasium, auditorium, a country club, and a couple of more. The whole place felt like a mini-town buried deep in the middle of nowhere. Aside from trees, there were also mountains nearby—I predicted that we would be doing some hiking up on them, which was a 'no' for me.*

*The country club was the weirdest part. Wasn't it supposed to be a summer camp? Why we were sharing it with a bunch of rich snobs? At first, I thought maybe some of the campers' parents were staying as well to keep an eye on their kids.* 

*It felt surreal just how isolated we were. No highways, no convenience stores, and not even a hint of cell service. It was just Oakhill Grove, surrounded by miles and miles of nothing but wilderness and some marsh. For someone, who isn't fond of the wilderness, like me, it was equally breathtaking and absolutely terrifying.*

The first few weeks, everything seemed normal. There were lots of activities to do—most of them I found exhausting or bland. Archery? I almost shot my instructor. Arts and crafts? Although I enjoyed it a bit, let’s just say I wasn’t destined to become the next Van Gogh. Entomology? Bug catching? Well, Jacob had fun chasing me around with a caterpillar. Wilderness survival I sucked at it, after I nearly set Jacob on fire when we tried to start one with flint and steel.

And don't get me started on the bonfire singalongs, the smores were delicious, but I couldn't carry a tune even if it saved my life.

I mean, aside from arts and crafts, sailing, or anything that had to do with water, was fun. Growing up, I've always loved going to the beach with Mom and Dad back when we still lived in Miami. At least Jacob was having a blast, unlike little ol' me, last thing I wanted was to ruin it for him.

The counselors, I found them weird. They were friendly and seemed eager to teach us some new things, but at the same time it felt so...detached. Fake.

A week before *it* happened. It was a sports fest that day, different cabins competing which one was the best.  I watched Jacob and the other kids playing tug of war as the other campers cheered them on and hyping everyone up. 

I clapped and let out a loud "Woooooooo!" after witnessing my little bro's team win. He ran up to me with a grin on his face.

"Did watch see me, Emma? Did you see us win!?"

"Hell yeah, I did. You sure kicked their asses," I praised him as I wiped the sweat off his back with a towel, he was soaking wet.

Then one of the counselors, Julie, walked up to me and told me that she and the head cook needed some help in the kitchen. One of their cooks called in sick, and they needed some extra hands with prepping the food and delivering it to the clubhouse. Some very important guests, members of the country club, just arrived with their families. Julie asked if I wanted to help.

I looked over to Jacob, seeing that he was being watched and supervised by a counselor. I shrugged. "Sure, why not?"

The kitchen was hot and packed. Thankfully, they didn’t give me anything too difficult. All I had to do was chop meat and veggies and pack the food into plastic containers. It wasn’t glamorous, but it beat standing around doing nothing. 

Almost an hour later, Mary, the head cook, called me over. “We need to get these boxes to the clubhouse,” she said, motioning to a pile of food-filled containers. “Grab a stack and follow me.” The other workers followed suit, and so did I.

*It was a hassle. The clubhouse was on the other side of the lake, we had to circle around carrying everything ourselves. The narrow, uneven path made it impossible for a car to get through.* 

Finally, after what felt like forever, we made it to the building. Even outside, you could hear the buzz of the people inside. 

I let out this huge, dramatic sigh of relief as we finally set the food down on the tables. For a second, I thought about just bolting out of there, but then curiosity got the better of me. I mean, how could it not? So, I stayed behind to take it all in.

It was *definitely* a country club. The dining hall looked like something out of a movie—huge and way too fancy for its own good, with chandeliers that were probably worth more than my entire house. The place was packed with people chatting and laughing, like they didn’t have a single problem in the world. Some were dressed to the nines in sharp suits and designer dresses, while others went for this weird “casual but still rich” look. You know the type—like they’re trying to seem low-key but somehow make it obvious their jeans cost $500.

Yup, definitely rich people.

A few kids were running around with sticky fingers, wreaking havoc while their parents were too busy mingling with the others. Some of them stopped to stare at me, which was *super* awkward. I pretended not to notice, but it was hard to ignore the way their wide eyes followed me like I was some kind of exotic animal. After a few seconds, they scampered back to their parents. Huh. Weird.

Old, middle-aged, young—I spot a couple who looked to be my age, they were probably dragged here too to attend whatever gaudy business meeting their parents had to attend. I wanted to go up to them and start a conversation, but I felt really out of place.

Leaning against a nearby wall, I pulled out my fidget cube and started playing with it, all the while observing the people around me.

Something caught my eye—Some of the members were sitting down, flipping through what looked like a menu, but it was a bit thicker, almost resembling a book, but the cover nearly looked like some kind of modern almanac. And they weren’t just reading them; they had these old-school wooden ink stamps, and they’d stamp whatever page caught their eye like they were voting on their dinner.

Seriously? That's how they're ordering?

It didn’t even make sense. Why did they need menus? We’d just put out this massive spread of food—pork, chicken, beef, shrimp, salad, you name it. They could’ve just walked up and helped themselves. Were they waiting for something *else*?

I squinted my eyes as I spotted Mr. Marshall, collecting envelopes from each guest. Hmm, it was probably some country club stuff, it does seem like he owned the place too.

"Thank you all very much! I hope you'll all enjoy your experience," he thanked them.

"If it's anything like last year, we sure will!" One of the ladies laughed while lifting up her glass of wine.

"After all, Vincent, everyone here paid up the nose to have some fun!" Another chimed in.

I couldn’t help but roll my eyes, to the point they'd go into the back of my skull. Pompous pricks, all of them.

I went back to fiddling with my fidget cube, but my hands slipped, and it clattered to the ground, bouncing a few feet away.

Before I could go to retrieve it, an older man picked it up. He examined it for a bit, before looking at me with a smile. He had muddy blonde hair, that had grey streaks showing age.

"Is this yours?" 

"Yeah, thanks." I took it from his hand. He started a conversation with me, his rather amber-colored eyes scanned me up and down.

"Hm, I didn't catch your name?"

"Emma. Emma Ashford, sir."

“Emma,” he repeated like he was testing the name out. “I don't recall seeing you around here before, where are your parents?”

"Uh, no,” I replied quickly, shaking my head. “I’m a camper. I was called here to help with the food.”

He hummed thoughtfully, and I glanced down, noticing a girl clutching his hand. She was maybe Jacob’s age, staring up at me with this unnerving intensity.

“Daddy, I’m hungry,” she whined, tugging on his arm. “I don’t like the appetizers. When can I have the main course?”

“Be patient, sweetheart,” he said, pinching her cheek. “It won't be long until night. Then it’ll be a *huge* buffet for my little princess.”

Yeah, okay. That was my cue to leave.

Feeling awkward, I mumbled something about needing to get back to work and started to walk away. As I headed for the exit, I could feel eyes on me—like they were burning holes into my back, which made me even more anxious.

Before I left the hall, I hesitated for a moment. On a whim, I snatched one of those weird menus from the table and stuffed it under my jacket. Nobody seemed to notice.

*To me, the rational side of my mind was telling me that it was probably just some business stuff. But for some reason, I couldn't shake the awful feeling of dread pooling in my stomach. It was as if something, for some reason, was telling me that something wasn't right.* 

*That feeling only got even worse the moment I saw what was on that list.*

As soon as I was out of sight of the building, I yanked the menu out of my bag and flipped to a random page.

What I saw made my stomach drop like I’d just fallen off a cliff.

Dread—pure, bone-deep dread—sank its claws into me.

There were a hundred pages in total. Each one had a photo of a camper along with a creepy amount of personal info: height, weight, blood type, bone structure, medical history, and body fat ratio. It was like reading a catalog for... I don’t even want to finish that thought.

And then I saw it—**my page.**

Photos of me taken without my consent. One of them was of me *sleeping*. My *freaking* medical history. My blood type. My everything.

"What the fuck. What the fuck. What the FUCK."

I started flipping through the pages like a maniac, my hands trembling. Each one made my stomach churn like I’d eaten something rotten.

Then I got to the “kid’s section.”

My heart stopped. Jacob was in it. Jacob. My **little brother**.

This wasn’t a camp. This was... I don’t even know what this was. A setup? A human trafficking ring? A menu for cannibals?! My brain couldn’t catch up, and honestly, I didn’t want it to.

I didn’t have time to think. My body moved on autopilot as I bolted back to camp. My legs were on fire, my lungs screamed for air, but I didn’t stop. I *couldn’t* stop.

When I got to the cabin and saw Jacob sitting there safe and sound, playing snakes & ladders with some other kids, I almost collapsed in relief. But I didn’t. I couldn’t afford to.

I crouched down, fussing over him like a crazy person. “You okay? You’re okay, right?”

Jacob blinked up at me, confused. “Yeah? What’s going on?”

“No time. Pack your stuff. Now.” My voice was shaking as I threw whatever I could into our bags, shoving the menu into mine like it was radioactive. Regardless, it was still evidence.

"J, listen to me," I knelt down to his level and looked into his eyes as intensely as I could to show that I was serious. "This camp isn't safe, we have to *leave*."

"Emma, you're scaring me. Why? What's wrong?" He looked up at me, eyes wide with fear.

"There's no time to explain, we have to leave *now*." I said with every conviction in my body.

Jacob hesitated for a few moments, then he nodded. Good kid. He grabbed his bag without another word.

The sun had already set some time ago. I quickly made my way to the payphone and dialed Mom's number. Thankfully, despite no service out here, the payphone worked fine—I wonder why these things went out of fashion.

*At the time, I figured it was best to slip away under the cover of darkness. We’d sneak past the counselors, slip through the gate, and once we hit the highway, make a run for it—hitch a ride to town and head straight to the police station.*

"Mom, please. You have to come pick us up. Something is wrong."

"Emma, you're not making any sense, why? What happened? Is Jacob alright?" My mother's concerned voice from the other end rang out.

"Mom. Something fucked is going on here, t-they took pictures of us sleeping! I'm not making this up. You have to come get us, please!" I nearly screamed into the phone, fear and desperation seeping into my voice.

"...Okay...okay, go get your brother. Don't let anybody see you, I'm gonna call 911 and me and Dad will get to you."

I nearly jumped for joy. Thank God! She listened! I could also hear my dad's frantic voice from the other end.

Tears welled up in my eyes. "Thank you! I love you, Mom!"

"Protect your brother, stay safe, both of you. I love you." And with that, the line disconnected. 

I quickly made my way back to the cabin, Jacob was still there, thankfully. "Let's go, we're leaving, be sure to stay quiet." 

He nodded, and we both left the cabin. Before we could leave any further, a sound sliced through the silence—a long, guttural howl that seemed to stretch across the entire forest.

We froze.

The howl lingered, haunting and primal, sending a shiver crawling up my spine. I turned toward the woods, the shadowy expanse suddenly feeling far too close.

"First time hearing a wolf since I got here," one of the campers murmured from nearby, startling me. His voice was calm, almost dreamy. "Man, that’s... beautiful. Don’t you think? Nature’s got a way of reminding us who’s really in charge."

I didn’t respond. My focus was on Jacob, whose wide eyes mirrored my own growing unease.

"Move," I hissed, gripping his arm tighter as I steered us away from the cabin.

We barely made it a few steps before another howl split the air, louder this time. Then another. And another. The calls multiplied, overlapping each other. The atmosphere seemed to ripple with their resonance, the forest coming alive with sound. 

I wasn't the only one, I could see the other campers stop what they were doing, their attention was on the woods. I could feel the growing fear in the air. 

"Wolves?"

"What the hell. That's gotta be hundreds of them."

The howls weren’t distant anymore. They were closing in, echoing from all directions, surrounding the camp like a tightening noose. My anxiety shot through the roof as I heard the sounds of crashing, the rustling of leaves, and harsh footsteps coming from the trees. People were already panicking, confused at what the fuck was going on.

Then there was silence.

Only for a bloodcurdling scream to shatter it. Our attention instantly snapped to the bonfire. My soul briefly left my body at what I saw.

"Help me! Help me!" Georgina shrieked for help as she was being dragged away into the woods by what looked like something out of a Stephen King novel—humanlike, black-furred, with a dog-like face. Her body was drenched in blood, she thrashed around wildly, desperate to escape, flailing around the bloody stumps, which was left of her arms. It moved on all fours as it helped itself on Georgina. Her screams of agony burned permanently into my mind as she was ripped apart. We could only watch in horror.

Another scream and we turned just in time to see a camper hurtling through the air. He crashed into the roof of a cabin, shattering the wood, and when he hit the ground, half of his body was *gone*.

With that, all hell broke loose.
