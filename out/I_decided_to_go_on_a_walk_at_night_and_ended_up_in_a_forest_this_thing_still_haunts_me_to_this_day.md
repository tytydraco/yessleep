Let me start this off with some basic information. I was 16 while this happened, my home life and relationship with my parents wasn’t the best. I found that night strolls through our small city was quite calming for me, so that’s what I did that night. After a huge argument with my parents about God knows what, I decided to go on a walk. I grabbed my headphones, phone and put on my shoes. I did all of that as quietly as possible. My room was located on the ground floor of the house which made it easier for me to sneak out. I connected my headphones to my phone and played some music right after I left through my window. 

I was on the outskirts of the city, right next to the forest. In all my life I heard numerous stories of the said forest, some say that it’s haunted, others say that some weird and deadly creatures live there. “This is all bullshit” I thought every time I heard another tale about this place. I looked at the time on my phone, it was 2:40 am so I decided to head inside the forest. Yes, I know, dumb idea but I was a teenager that needed some one on one time with nature to calm me down and the forest seemed like the best option at the time.

I was already 40 minutes deep inside the forest when weird things started happening. My music was cut off, I looked at my phone only to find that it was dead. “Damn it” I said under my breath as I tried to turn it on to no avail. I sighed deeply, it was supposed to be a relaxing time, not frustrating. In that second I heard the bushes to my left rustle. I immediately turned to look that way but saw nothing. “Probably a rabbit” I thought and turned to the direction which I came from, good thing that I was following the main path. After 5 minutes of walking I heard another rustle behind me but again, I found nothing so I continued my journey. The same thing happened three or four more times before I saw it. After the fifth time of hearing something behind me I turned around and immediately froze. There was a white, boney hand sticking out of the bush. I managed to catch a glimpse of what seemed like an African Kudu skull before I started running. I was terrified, right after I started sprinting I heard a horrifying cry and the patter of four legs. 

Soon I was out of the forest and in the middle of abandoned train tracks. I frantically looked around for the creature that was chasing me previously. I only saw a glint of white eyes on the edge of the forest, watching my every movement. I stared back at the monster for a few seconds before running along the train tracks.

I made it home as quickly as possible and locked my window right away. I didn’t sleep that night at all, I was too scared by what I saw. 

Now I’m 21 years old and I never told anyone about that night. I’m always on the run, switching cities trying to escape but it always seems to find a way back to me. Day by day I hear and see it getting closer, I hear the horrifying sounds it makes, I see it’s face and feel that haunting presence. 

To whoever reading this: DON’T make the same mistake, if anyone tells you to not enter some place, just listen. I didn’t and now I’m paying the price. If you’re reading this I’m already gone. It’s 3:45 am and I hear this creature scratching on my bedroom door. There’s no escape so I’ll just accept my fate.
