I am not sure if I am grasping to hold onto my identity or if it is a response to the stress of my current situation, but I just wanted to tell someone about me. What led up to this point in my life. So that maybe, no matter what happens next, I will feel like someone out there got a chance to know me like I know me. Maybe someone will recognize me and know where I am supposed to go...

\*\*\*

I wish I knew what going home felt like. Even as young as I can remember, I have always felt like I was just visiting. When I was a kid this wasn't unpleasant. I was curious and excited soaking in all there was around me. How does that feel? Why does that happen? Where does this go? Who are these people? I was so vibrantly alive even my dreams were lucid.

I remember playing in the forest behind my childhood home. Most days I would go to this spot along the creek where a big tree blocked out enough sun to keep the undergrowth at bay. The creek bank was overlooked by a small rock that made just enough of a cliff that I could sit up there safe from the wet even when the creek was swollen with rain. The tree's roots were exposed along the bank where the creek had washed away what dirt it tried to hold onto and sometimes I found things deposited there.

Some days, I would climb the tree singing nonsense songs to the forest around me while I watched birds and squirrels go about their day. Others, I would dig channels in the creek watching how the flow of the water changed and how the current shaped the sand or carried leaves away.

I would see the creek spot in my dreams, but in the dreamscape there was a boy that would emerge from the roots of the tree. Somehow clean and dry, he would sing with me and play with me, but never actually spoke. I wonder how he knew the words to my songs, I didn't even know. The lyrics were in a language foreign to me and seemed to just fall out of my mouth.

When I first began dreaming of him, I would wake up so excited in the morning and rush out to the creek spot. I would search the place, try to dig through the roots, call for him, but he never came even when I was muddy with bleeding fingers leaning against the tree for support sobbing and confused. When I dreamt I tried to ask him why he ignored me before and he would just smile sadly. His sympathy didn't make it hurt less.

Eventually, I gained the understanding that, dreams and waking were separate places. The next time I dreamt of him, I told him that I didn't want to dream of the creek anymore. I felt like I was poisoning my love for the real creek spot by dreaming of it with him. Every time I would go there, I would ache for him to be with me.

I remember when I told him he smiled that sad smile again and hugged me. I wasn't sure he understood at first, but then he took my hand and brought me to the deepest part of the creek. I looked at him quizzically and he gestured for me to lay in the water. I obeyed holding my breath before I submerged myself in the shallow water. He crossed my arms in front of me like a mummy and I watched him curiously from just below the water's surface waiting to see what he was doing.

He placed his hands on my chest and, just as my lungs started burning for air, he firmly pushed me down like someone shoving a boat away from a dock. And to my surprise, though I had laid on solid creek bed, I floated backward like there was much deeper water beneath me. A nothingness spread from behind me as the surface of the water floated gently away. The last thing I can remember seeing of that dreamscape were little rings of ripples in the water's surface like it had just started to rain. I reached for him, but within moments, the nothingness fully enveloped me.

I haven't dreamt of him or the creek spot since. This, this is when my endless curiosity for the world was stained with a tinge of homesickness. I didn't realize it at first, but I began wanting to go home.

Sorry, I will have to write more later. I’m sitting at a fast food place so I could use their wifi and charge my phone, but they want me to leave. I’m not supposed to be here this long I guess. I’ll write more once I find a new place I can be for a little while.
