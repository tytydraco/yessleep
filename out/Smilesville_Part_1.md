When I finally summoned the courage to leave my abusive husband, I was admitted into a shelter for battered women like myself. The people who ran the place were smart, and it was made to look like a thrift shop on the outside, with the shelter being behind the business surrounded by a tall fence. It was for people in really desperate situations, they took extreme measures to make sure no one's violent spouse could find the place, like confiscating our phones and only allowing us to use them if we were outside the immediate area. 

When I came there, they put me on a waiting list for a housing program that gives homes and new identities to abuse victims, homeless people, and occasionally people in need of witness protection. It was called the Brighter Days Agency, or something like that. Women left the shelter one by one, until finally it was my turn. I packed what little I had and got into a dark van with tinted windows, driven by a case worker named Mrs. Stratton assigned to me by the agency, and her coworker Mr. Hudson. 

I questioned why the windows were tinted, because it made it impossible to see the way there, and they simply smiled brightly and said it was to protect the identity of the passengers and also to prevent them from telling dangerous people the town's location. I figured this was a good enough reason and tried to enjoy the three hour long ride. When we got close, Mrs. Stratton turned down the windows and smiled at me. 

“Miss Turner, we're here! Take a look.” 

My eyes eagerly observed the surroundings of the car, grateful to finally see outside. We were still driving, but when I stuck my head out, I could see we were approaching buildings up ahead. A sign proclaiming ‘Welcome to Smilesville’ with a little text underneath that saying ‘brighter days start here! :)’ (Yes, they had engraved a smiley face into it.) 

“Smilesville?” I turned to them. 

Mr. Hudson nodded. “It truly lives up to its name. You're gonna love it here, Cindy, trust me.” 

“Are we still in Nevada?” I looked at the rolling hills and dense forest that surrounded the town before the tall buildings engulfed my view of the rural land.

Mrs. Stratton and Mr. Hudson chuckled in an almost condescending manner, but didn't answer my question. I decided to let it go, assuming the answer was yes. It seemed like a normal town, with shopping centers and busy streets full of regular people. Soon, we arrived at a suburban neighborhood named The Villa, where we parked at a leasing office. 

The receptionist took us on a tour and I signed some papers, and everything seemed normal, until they placed an NDA in front of me. 

“You cannot tell the outside world about this town under any circumstances.” Mrs. Stratton said, her smile seeming more forced than before. Mr. Hudson and the receptionist stared at me with similar expressions and I felt like an ant under a magnifying glass. 

“You'll find that social media is not allowed here.” Mr. Hudson added. “You can use search engines and there are websites for educational purposes, but we've blocked all sorts of online forums to prevent word from getting out. I'm sure you understand.” 

“So, no Facebook or Instagram or anything?” I asked. 

“Precisely.” The receptionist nodded. “Although I'm sure you wouldn't want everyone and their mother knowing about your whereabouts anyways, considering everyone here has a… dark history.”

“It's no problem, at least my old high school friends can stop sending me invites to Farmville.” I joked, drawing a chuckle out of them. I truly didn't care. I was riddled with bruises and scars from the abuse that I suffered at the hands of my husband, Micheal. He's the son of the chief of police so it felt like he could truly get away with murder, and he was surrounded by a huge support system that would back him up, unlike me. I'd left several times but came crawling back because I had nothing and nobody without him. When I left for good, he promised me he'd find me and kill me. He was a stalker, and a damn good one at that, he had stalked me those other times I'd left until I found that secret women's shelter. He couldn't seem to find me there. 

Needless to say, I was beyond terrified of him and I didn't care what websites I couldn't use in order to stay in such a beautiful, and more importantly, safe place. After I signed the NDA, I was given a new name. No longer was I Cindy Turner, but Madison Gilmore, with a fake but official looking birth certificate and new government ID. I didn't know that was legal, but what did I care? I was free. 

“One last thing.” Mrs. Stratton held my house keys at bay as we stood in front of my new residence, her face becoming serious once more. “Be sure to always wear a smile when you leave the house. You're never properly dressed without it.” 

“Why?” 

“That's the most important law in Smilesville.” Mrs. Stratton's smile strained. “You can do whatever you like within the confines of your new home, but outside of it, you absolutely must smile at all times and show as little negative displays of emotion as humanly possible. If you don't, I can't guarantee your stay here will be very long.” 

I frowned, thinking this was ridiculous. Forcing victims of abuse to act fake happy all the time was sickening to me, and I was known as a bit of a grouch by everyone else in the shelter. “This is all wonderful, but isn't it a bit much to threaten to make me homeless again if I don't act happy go lucky?” 

“Cin-*I mean,* Madison, that is a *very* small price to pay for everything we've given you.” Mrs. Stratton lectured me, making me feel like an ungrateful brat. “And it's for your own good. Everyone else can handle it. Can you?” 

I nodded and she gave me the house keys. “Let's practice. Give me a big smile right now. Come on, I know you have it in you!” 

I smiled for her, intentionally fake and cheesy on purpose, but she seemed to glow with satisfaction. “What a beautiful smile, Miss Gilmore. Please remember to show it to everyone everywhere you go no matter what happens or what anyone says. Have a wonderful life.” With that, she left. 

The home I was given was beautiful, a single family two storey house with eggshell white walls and modern, minimalist decor. It was already furnished, and I was given a voucher for new clothes and a grocery budget for the month until I could secure a job. It felt like heaven, truly, and they'd already transported my car here before I myself even arrived. I found my vehicle in the garage and drove to the shops in town. That's when I noticed that things were off. 

First off, I visited some clothing boutiques. My clothes were worn and cheap, with holes and tears. Micheal didn't like me having nice things because in his opinion that was telling all the men in public that I was available. It took me a few minutes to realize, but the staff that greeted and assisted me weren't the only ones with giant, bubbly smiles plastered over their faces. The customers wore big grins, too, no matter what they were doing. A tired looking mother bounced her crying baby up and down while smiling big enough to show her teeth, although it clearly didn't reach her weary eyes. 

A different mother, this one with a toddler, was smiling for absolutely no reason as she thumbed through shirts hanging on a rack. It then hit me that her child was wearing a mask, one that was made to look like a regular smiling human's face with rosy cheeks and a realistic nose. Her bright blue eyes stared at me through the holes in the mask. 

“Hello!” Her mother greeted me, as she must've noticed I was staring. 

“Hi!” I smiled back at her. “I'm new here. What a cute mask your kid has…” I was lying of course, the mask was creepy, but I wanted to bring it up somehow. 

“Oh yes, well, she was kicking up a fuss this morning so I had to break out the smiling mask.” The mother laughed. She noticed my confused look. “Anytime you find smiling a bit harder than usual, there are Smile shops with masks so you don't get flagged down.” 

“....Flagged down?”

“By the officers, the Smile Sentinels.” The woman replied, her smile twitching. “Didn't they brief you on all this? You must smile, it's the number one rule, if you don't, you could get in big trouble! So smile!” She put her fingers in the corners of her mouth and stretched them, making me realize I wasn't smiling and correcting myself. 

Feeling nervous about my new home, I smiled throughout my entire transaction in that store, and then gave the muscles in my face a break once I was walking to my car in the parking lot. I wondered what exactly was up with this town as I looked around at passersby and noticed how joyful they appeared, like they'd just won the lottery. Even a homeless man sitting on a bench nearby had a gleeful demeanor. It was pretty uncomfortable, to be honest, but ultimately harmless. 

I went to the grocery store next. Everyone inside and outside the building was eerily smiling as well, their eyes perpetually squinted in mirth and their voices cartoonishly chipper. I just remember walking around with my cart and observing how happy everyone seemed. That's when I noticed them. 

The entire time I'd been out, I’d seen men and women in uniform here and there, people I assumed to be police officers because of their dark official looking outfits with batons and walkie talkies attached at their hip. I saw one, a man, up close, and he was pale with bags under his dark, gloomy eyes and a big grin on his face. He was stationed in a corner by the produce and his eyes had been fixed on me for a very long time. Upon looking him over, I realized he didn't have a police badge, but rather a different kind of badge I didn't recognize. Remember the little girl's mask? It was made to look like that, like he had a mini porcelain mask clipped to his chest, framed with ornate gold. 

I glared at him, feeling intensely uncomfortable at how long he was staring at me. No sooner than my eyes narrowed and my brows furrowed, I saw his smile twitch as he uncrossed his arms and strode over to stand in front of me. 

“Good afternoon, ma'am!” His voice was deep and he sounded like a child on Christmas morning. “Isn't it a beautiful day today?” 

“I guess.” I remember replying. 

“I couldn't help but notice you left the house in an improper state.” He continued, earning a confused look from me which then made him elaborate. “You seem to have put on your smile upside down, ma'am. Do I have to fix that for you?” 

I tensed, feeling that there was a subtle threat in his forcefully happy voice. Instead of snapping at him like I wanted to, my eyes looked down to his baton, and what looked like some kind of featureless bottle of mace I didn't notice before, and I decided to simply flash a tight, temporary smile at him before pushing my cart along. 

But the man, a Smile Sentinel I assumed, followed me and tapped my shoulder. I faced him with frustration and his smile seemed even more strained. “Ma’am… are you going to be a problem?” 

“What am I doing that's so bad?” I let loose on him, ignoring the awkward stares other passing shoppers gave us (while still maintaining their smiles). “I can't possibly smile every second of the day, that's inhuman!” 

“It sounds like you're going to be a problem.” His voice took a dive from cheerful to a weird mix of that and threatening, a borderline sadistic tone, even. He removed his baton and I felt a rush of fear. “It sounds like you're becoming hysterical and disrupting this happy environment. Will I have to discipline you?” 

Before I could say anything, a familiar face intervened. Sandra, a woman from the shelter I had befriended who'd left for this place half a year ago, stepped between us with a beaming expression. “Sorry, my friend here is just new. She has no problem being happy, officer. Right?” 

She turned to me and her eyes widened in a way that suggested if I knew what was good for me I'd play along. I vigorously nodded and forced my lips to curl upward, showing the Smile Sentinel my bad teeth which my husband had disfigured. The officer backed up and put away his baton, nodding in satisfaction. “Oh, that's good, then. I was worried we had a problem on our hands. Have a wonderful life, ladies.” 

I watched as he returned to his position, then Sandra gestured for me to follow her before pushing her cart into an aisle where we were out of his sight. 

“What the hell was that?” I whispered to her.  

“Girl, didn't they tell you anything when you came here?” Sandra looked at me like I was crazy. I took this moment to give her a once over.  I remember her always looking haggard and ten years older than her actual age, but now she looked like a sight for sore eyes, with a new hairdo, professionally applied makeup, and nice clothes.

Sandra had a similar story to me, she had left her abusive husband who had apparently had ties with the local street gang in our hometown, and she was absolutely certain that he and his demented friends would gun her down in a drive-by shooting if they saw her out in public.  He had threatened her with this countless times, and she even discreetly confessed to me that he'd told her he killed other people who crossed him the same way and was never found out. She was a middle aged woman with three kids that were in foster care until she could secure herself a house, kids who were presumably at home at that moment. 

“What is this place?” I asked her. 

“Let's not talk here… Let's meet at my place.” 

I followed her to her home in my car, and coincidentally, she lived in my neighborhood maybe a few blocks down. Her three kids were running about playing as we sat and talked in the dining room. 

Sandra explained to me that this town was absolutely perfect, until it came down to the weird smile rule they had. No matter what was going on in your life, if you weren't smiling every second of your time in public, you would be taken into custody, and horrendous things happened to those that were carried away by the Smile Sentinels. She didn't even want to go into detail about it, but she did say that repeat offenders would either disappear or become a Smile Sentinel with a completely reworked personality, as if they'd been brainwashed. 

“Things will go well for you if you just do what they say.” Sandra assured me. “There's great schools and plenty of jobs here.” 

“But what happens to the people that disappear, do they get kicked out of town?” I wanted to know. 

Sandra opened her mouth then closed it, looking away from me in tense silence. She slowly shook her head. “Look… I think it's best if you don't get too curious, okay?” 

“Sandra, what happens to those people?” I pressed. 

“My name isn't Sandra anymore, it's Diane!” She snapped. 

“I saw this kid who was wearing a mask, and her mother said they put masks on kids who have a hard time with the smiling thing.” I said, shuddering. “Have your kids ever had to do that?”

“...Yes.” She admitted. “Aisha had hurt her knee pretty badly playing outside, so she burst into tears. We were at the park and I hadn't brought my car so I tried to run and carry her back. An officer was patrolling in his car and stopped us, and I begged him to just let me get her home, but… but he… he…” Her eyes watered.

“He what?” I leaned in, growing concerned. My gaze flicked over to where Aisha, a six year old girl, was sitting with her back to us watching television, more still and silent than a girl her age should be. She was watching a cartoon show where the main characters were in a hospital, and she seemed completely enraptured by it.

“He told me her crying was obscene and I should've had a mask with us to hide her face.” Sandra continued, choked up. “Then he got out the car and grabbed her, and his- his partner held me back while he- he took something off his belt… I thought it was mace at first but it wasn't, it was…” 

*“Time for your shot!”* One of the cartoon characters' bubbly voices cut through our conversation. *“This will only hurt a bit!”*

Suddenly, Aisha threw her head back and exploded into hysterics. Her keening laughter bounced over the walls and scared the absolute shit out of me. She was laughing so hard the sound was almost aggressive or violent, as weird as that sounds. Tears started running down her face, and her eyes rolled into the back of her head, showing those little red veins. Vomit started to build up in her throat, dribbling down her chin and splashing over her shirt. She gurgled it as she continued laughing through her puking, and it splattered onto the carpet and filled the air with a sour smell. 

The sight was enough to make me want to run out the door, it was incredibly frightening and so abrupt. She looked possessed in every sense of the word. Her siblings stared at her while hugging each other in fear, and Sandra got up and ran to her. 

“What's wrong with her?!” I asked, standing up from the table. “Should I call-?” 

“Don't call anyone!” Sandra yelled back, picking up Aisha and holding her close, letting her vomit get all over her. She started to carry the girl upstairs. “Aubrey, turn that shit off! She can't watch this show anymore! She can't watch anything to do with needles!” 

“Needles…?” I went over to the bottom of the stairs and watched them go up, desperate for answers. “Did he…inject her with something?” 

Aisha looked over her mother's shoulder down at me as Sandra got to the top step, her eyes were unseeing and she cackled ceaselessly as vomit and saliva poured down her bottom lip in rivulets. She looked utterly insane, but I don't remember Sandra ever saying anything was wrong with her mentally. 

Sandra shot a glare at me and said, “You should go home, we'll catch up later,” then disappeared down the hall. 

Utterly flabbergasted, I left the house and drove to my own place. I replayed the events in my head as I put away my groceries and my new wardrobe. What did they inject that poor little girl with that would give her such horrible PTSD, and how could someone in a position of authority just do that? You're telling me these people can just hurt us whatever way they want with no repercussions? All for being upset in public? 

I felt uneasy that night as I microwaved myself a TV dinner and channel surfed in the living room. Cable and WiFi had already been installed for me, conveniently enough. After I ate that processed junk, I went through my phone to verify what they'd said to me earlier, and indeed, 99% of the websites I usually visited were blocked, presumably by my Wi-Fi network, and by the service they gave me for phone data too. Sandra had said everyone in town used the same provider. Maybe it was like this not to protect us, but to hide what they were doing here to people. Still, I had nowhere else to go and I had been looking forward to this for a long time. Maybe I could stay here until I saved up enough to move elsewhere, to another state even? 

I was just about to call it a night when I heard a commotion outside. I paused the TV and listened. Someone was sobbing and wailing, loud enough to wake the whole street, so I rushed to my front step to see what was going on. 

A couple of houses down, a woman was in hysterics, following a few paradamics as they wheeled someone covered in a white blanket on a stretcher to the ambulance. She eventually collapsed onto her yard sobbing as they put the body in the back of the vehicle. What seemed to be her husband ran to her in a panic and tried to force her up so he could get her back in the house. He was yelling at her. The sight triggered me a little, reminding me of how violently my husband handled me even during my worst moments. 

All the neighbors that were outside immediately retreated into the house, which I thought was odd. Usually people loved to be nosy, and would form a crowd to watch scenes like that. Instead, they were ushering their kids inside and hurrying to slam their doors and shut their blinds. The air was rife with a high tension that made a chill run down my spine, but still, I continued to watch on my doorstep, considering offering help. 

Then I heard a siren. It wasn't a police siren, it honestly reminded me of a fire alarm or a tornado siren. A bright yellow car with flashing neon yellow lights affixed to the roof careened down the street. Smile Sentinels charged out of the vehicle and apprehended the grieving woman. I watched in horror as the husband tried to fight them and got beaten within an inch of his life by their batons. The woman was restrained by two of the officers while a third produced the small canister from their belt. The answers I was seeking became clear to me as it looked like they stabbed something in the side of the woman's face, administering a shot. 

Almost immediately, she started to laugh like a mad woman and fall all over herself in the yard, reminding me of the frantic and discombobulated movements of a rabid animal going nuts. She couldn't seem to walk straight, and she stumbled from side to side and scrambled over the ground as if she were inebriated on all sorts of hard substances, unconcerned with the fact her husband lay unconscious a few feet away in a bloody heap. It was like watching a train wreck, I couldn't tear my eyes away.  

That is, until one of the Smile Sentinels looked my way and I instinctively stepped back inside the house and slammed and locked the door. What the hell did I get myself into? Why would they send depressed victims of abuse such as myself into a place where they could be abused even more? Was protection from my husband worth all this? 

Then I remembered just how terrified that man had me in my own house everyday and decided that I would ignore it all and play along. I know it sounds crazy but...With my husband, there was no chance of safety whatsoever, but here, all I had to do to be safe was smile. I couldn't go back to living in that shelter, let alone living in cheap motels. I just couldn't. 

So I assimilated into this strange private society, making sure I smiled whenever I left my home, and I focused on trying to rebuild my life after my complete mess of a marriage. I met with Sandra more often (I will be referring to her by her old name to avoid confusion) and I found a mundane but remote customer representative job, so I didn't have to leave the house as much. But things became hard to ignore one day when I was out running errands. 

I was driving back home, sipping a to-go cup of coffee, when traffic was held up by a protest. A crowd of people, some wearing custom made frowning masks and some just scowling or crying, filled the street with picket signs protesting the smile law. Those yellow cruisers entered the scene not long after and a legion of Smile Sentinels attacked the protestors, beating and arresting them and loading them into the backs of their cars. This greatly disturbed me, seeing the bruised and bloody faces of those protestors and the blood stains they left on the road. 

Back at home, I watched the local news where the newswoman was grimly informing the public about a rebellion in Smilesville. The rebellion was called the Scowlers, and anyone that was considered to be a part of them would be taken into custody immediately. That's not the bad part, though. What disturbed me was that the Council that ran that small town in place of a mayor, was putting in extremist measures to snuff out the rebellion. Everyone was to wear a smile mask when leaving the house to show their loyalty, that was a new law that would be put in place within the next week. The worst part was that everyone would be required to medicate daily with a less strong version of what they called the Smile Shot, which is what the Sentinels have been using against “hysterical” citizens. The same shit that made that little girl and that woman go ballistic. 

This terrified me and I thought surely they weren't serious. But they were, *Jesus Christ* they *were.* 

Within the next seven days, they introduced this bizarre new lifestyle to everyone in town. Every Monday, every single household would be delivered a package with enough doses of the Smile serum to last a week along with alcohol pads and clean needles. Every tenant in the household had to be medicated daily, including children. Infants were spared of course, but they always had to remain at home, or be given special medication they released specifically for the purpose of 'safely' keeping the baby asleep so as not to cause disturbances. They wouldn't tell people what was in it. The bottle of pills was white with no label of ingredients.

All schools and workplaces opened an hour earlier so you could be tested for the serum, and if it wasn't found in your bloodstream (or there wasn't enough in your bloodstream) you would be administered it right then and there, and that would be a strike. If you got to strike 3, then the Smile Sentinels would be called on you, and good God they got more brutal each time.

This town was insane. As far as I could tell, there was absolutely no normal police department, just an equivalent  for Sentinels (the ‘Sentinel Stations’) where you could file a report against someone for not smiling as crazy as that sounds, and virtually no real crime other than the ones perpetuated against the smile law and petty thievery or vandalism now and again. It seemed that the Sentinels also served as police, but thieves and vandals would either not be heard from again or brainwashed into a Sentinel rather than being jailed. It was like they were trying so hard to make the perfect place, but it was a dystopian nightmare. 

Since I worked from home, I did not have to be tested daily, so I thought I could get away with not injecting the serum into myself. After all, they didn't tell anyone what was in it, and what if I had a bad reaction to that sickly, vibrant yellow fluid? However, I didn't get away with this, not at all. 

At the end of the first week, I was cooking myself breakfast when I got a knock on the door. The sight I got in the peephole was nothing short of terrifying, there was a prim and proper looking woman standing outside with two male Smile Sentinels behind her. All three of them were wearing these flesh colored, shiny masks with big plastic grins and rosy cheeks, and one of the officers had the handle of a sleek white medical case in his hand. 

I opened the door and the woman raised a pen to the clipboard she was holding and went, “Hello, I assume you're Miss Madison Gilmore. I'm an assistant of the Council here to perform your weekly Smile Serum test.” 

Dumbfounded, I stared at them and their masks of realistic human faces for a few seconds. “... What?” 

“If you could step aside so we can enter, that would be most appreciated!” The woman chirped. 

“I-I’m busy-” I stammered, scrambling to find an excuse. 

“Ma'am,” the overly joyful voice of one of the Sentinels interrupted me, “if you don't step aside we will have to use force. Let's all be happy and compliant today instead!” 

They forced their way inside, their broad shoulders shoving my underweight frame out of the way easily. The woman strode into the living room after the Sentinels with a pep in her step, “Don't worry, I am a trained nurse and this will not take long!” 

I sat down nervously as they opened the case and produced a needle. She drew my blood, put it in a tube, gave it to one of the Sentinels, and he left for the van they had parked outside. “He's just running a quick test.” The woman said. 

It took maybe around twenty to thirty minutes, with the woman chatting my ear off to pass the time. I was drowning in anxiety and gave her short, blunt answers, before finally the Sentinel returned with a slip of paper in hand. He eyed me through the holes in his eerie mask as he handed the test results to the woman. 

“Oh dear!” The woman exclaimed melodramatically. “It seems that your test came back negative! You haven't been taking your injections, have you?!” 

“Please, I can explain…” I nervously looked up at the Sentinels who stared down at me with their hands clasped behind their backs. 

“Lucky for you, I can give you a dosage.” She produced a needle loaded with neon yellow fluid from the white case. I stood up frantically, and the Sentinels forced me back down in my seat, holding one of my arms out for the woman to tie a band around my flesh in order for a vein to become visible. “Thankfully, this version of the serum can be administered to areas other than the face. This will only hurt a bit.” 

Oh, how to describe that experience? It felt like they had injected lava into my veins, and my body temperature skyrocketed. My brain began to buzz, I can't even begin to describe that sensation so that's the closest I can get to telling you. I began to have muscle spasms and my limbs twitched and jerked. My eyes watered and tears fell. Suddenly, I cracked a smirk, then a smile, then a full on grin. I felt like a puppet, I couldn't control how the muscles in my face contorted. Every time I tried to force my lips to a flat line, it felt like trying to hold back an inevitable sneeze, or trying to bend an appendage in a way it wasn't meant to be bent, and I failed. It was God awful and I'd sooner shoot myself than endure it again. 

“There we are.” She said with satisfaction. “I'm afraid I'll have to give you a strike, however, for your inability to follow our rules. Don't fret though, you still have two more until we have to crack the whip on you.” 

Then, they promptly left, and I was left a shaking mess, not because I was scared, that was yet another symptom. The symptoms weren't all just physical though, it was also mental anguish. For the rest of the day, every time I felt even remotely negative, like for example remembering the cruel words my husband hurled at me or thinking about how I wish I could have a glow up like Sandra's because of how ugly I felt; the serum would punish me. I would feel a shock shoot through me, like static electricity when you run your feet on the carpet and touch metal. *Especially* when I would feel fear thinking about what was happening in this town, the effects tripled. Then I would suffer a God awful migraine and a feeling of euphoric high, which made me feel like I was tripping on acid more than truly happy. 

During this high, I would burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter that would go on for so long I almost suffocated, my sides and my face aching horrendously. It was like being tickled to the point of torture, with the person tickling you not letting up even though you couldn't breathe and tears were running down your face and you were about to vomit. And vomit, I certainly did. A lot. I grew tired of the acidic taste of bile in my throat, and my brain felt like it was chock full of a swarm of bees, but I couldn't make any of it stop. As the hours ticked by, it got slightly better to deal with, but just the thought of doing this everyday terrified me…

Running errands in town became more interesting of an experience, as everyone else was also suffering the symptoms of the Smile Serum. I couldn't seem to get used to people around me bursting into fits of cackles without warning, for seemingly no reason whatsoever, and I jumped out of my skin every time. Smilesville seemed to turn into a town of ‘smile junkies,’ as the rebels called us, tripping off a high no one's seen before, rivaling the unpredictable behavior of methheads and crackheads. When getting lunch, I saw a table full of bereaved individuals wearing black who clearly just returned from a funeral procession, but they grinned like the Cheshire cat and howled with mad laughter like the Joker as endless tears poured down from their torment-filled eyes.

I vented about all this when I had a coffee with Sandra next, at her house of course, and she shared my sentiments. Her kids hated shots and made that very clear with tantrums, same as the other elementary schoolers, but over time the injections warped the way they behaved. She cried to me, wishing she had her children back the way they were. She said it felt like they were in what she called ‘la la land' all the time, like they weren't ‘all there’ if you catch my drift, and I felt for her. 

“I'm starting to think maybe those ‘Scowlers’ or whatever they were called were right.” Sandra sighed, running her hand through her hair and watching as Aubrey, her eldest, giggled and mindlessly ran around the kitchen in circles for no particular reason. “It's not worth all this.” 

“Yeah…” I agreed hesitantly. I was lying, actually. Even though this all felt hellish, the abuse of my husband lingered in the back of my mind, and the loneliness I had felt, too. Even though it was like Crazy Town, I could feel somewhat a sense of community in Smilesville. Even though those smiles and kind gestures were forced, it was better than the dark reality back home, where my peers coldly ignored my swollen eye and bloody nose, and strangers didn't spare me a sideways glance. 

But I soon would realize just how awful things were in Smilesville, as the situation escalated beyond control. 

People were being outed as Scowlers more and more, anonymous tips being made and sending Sentinels barging through their doors. They were not seen again. Sandra told me that there were spies for the Council hidden everywhere, they were simply normal townspeople secretly given the responsibility of finding members of the Scowlers and pretending to want to join their ranks in order to bust them. You didn't even have to participate in protests to be a Scowler, you just had to refuse to take the serum. As much as I hated the injections, I knew it had to be done, but Sandra told me a way to get away with taking less was injecting it every two days rather than daily. It was still harrowing for my mind and body but I found that I coped better. 

I thought about it long and hard, and I finally contacted my case worker and asked her to meet with me at my house. Mrs. Stratton arrived with an ugly smile mask and sat across from me at my dining room table. “So what is it you would like to discuss, Miss Gilmore?” 

“I want to move.” I explained, a painful smile stuck on my tear-soaked face. “I want to leave this program, and find somewhere else to live. It's just not worth the suffering.” 

Mrs. Stratton stared at me through her mask for a few painfully silent moments, then sighed. “Okay, hon. Let me gather the paperwork and get back to you on that.” 

This instilled me with hope and I hugged her before she left. I was so ecstatic to be leaving that I started packing some of my things straight away that night. At this point I had lived here for a few months, while enduring this smile serum nonsense for one whole month, and I was fully prepared to get on the road and never look back even if it meant I'd be without a home for a while. 

Oh God, if only I'd known what chaos would transpire next, I would've packed everything and left that very night.
