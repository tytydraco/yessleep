I didn’t think twice about the Wi-Fi name when I first checked into the Airbnb. After all, who cares if the network is called ‘Hilltop Hideaway Wi-Fi’ or ‘Relax and Unwind’? It’s just another quirk of staying in a random house for the night. But by the time I left, that Wi-Fi name was burned into my memory. You see as crazy as it makes me sound, this wasn’t just a network. It was.. watching me.

I guess I'll give you all some context, maybe it can help me figure it out as I recite it. After all, I've always been quite anxious and on edge with things like this. I can assure you that this wasn't some trick that my mind was pulling, though. 
My name is Alex and I work on the road. It's the kind of job that makes you care less about the little things - what the bed looks like, if the bathroom tiles are clean - I've seen some real shitholes in the past that I've needed to stop at for a night, whether it be a family member's or a friend's place. Just like those instances, this was a pretty last minute plan. It was cheap, private, and just about far away enough from the highway to feel quiet but not entirely deserted. I could still make out car headlights from the bedroom window and hear the faint side of cars driving by. 
This isn't one of those stories where the host was weird from the getgo. She wasn't strange at all actually - very friendly, quick to answer any questions I had and she left a note for me with the password for the internet. It felt safe. Comforting, even. 

At least that's how it was at the start. 

Now, she was an elderly woman. The reason that I'm going to clarify that is because a few hours later, once I was settling down and watching some TV, I noticed that my phone had disconnected from the Wi-Fi. I made nothing of it, went to reconnect.. and noticed that the name had changed. Instead of "Hilltop Hideaway Wi-Fi" it now read "DidYouLockTheDoor?". I pointed out that she was elderly because at the time, I played it off as something like her not really grasping technology, maybe mistaking this as being a way to contact me directly. I laughed it off, the innocent thought of that humouring me. Regardless I made sure that the door was locked, which it was. Texting the number that she had left behind, I kindly told her that the place was all locked up but didn't get a text back. 

I didn't think too much of it after that. Why would I? I had already made a conclusion in my mind that to me seemed like a real possibility. I went to sleep shortly after but found myself waking up at around 1:30 in the morning, with an incredibly dry throat. The host had welcomed me to drink and eat anything that was there and so I made my way to the kitchen, scouting the refrigerator for any refreshing beverages. I was scrolling through my phone at the same time, checking Twitter and Instagram, when suddenly my feed stopped loading. The Wi-Fi wasn't amazing here but I suppose it wasn't a huge issue, since I'd be leaving early in the morning anyway. 

I went to connect to the network again and that's when my throat somehow became even drier than before.

"DontLookOutside".

The room felt colder than it should have been, like someone had left a window cracked. I glanced toward the front door, then the curtains over the sliding glass door in the living room. They were closed, just like I had left them, but the thought burrowed in: What if someone was out there? Watching?

I tried to laugh it off again, but it didn’t stick this time. My phone stayed in my hand, screen glowing as I stared at the Wi-Fi name again. 
‘DontLookOutside.’
I told myself it was just a prank this time. Clearly, there were other people nearby who were able to change the name of the network. Kids, most likely. Even still, a part of me couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't a prank at all. An uneasiness settled into the back of my head but it was too late for things like this, I needed to wake up relatively early to leave. 

The next morning, things felt normal again. The sun was out, the birds were chirping, and the house seemed as peaceful as it had been when I first arrived. I laughed at myself for SERIOUSLY letting some kid's joke make me feel so uncertain of my safety.

But.. when I checked my phone, it made me freeze up. The Wi-Fi had changed again. This time, it simply read: ‘ISeeYouSleeping.’

I hadn’t mentioned to anyone that I’d stayed in the house the night before. There was no way someone could’ve known that. I checked the clock on the wall; 8:17 a.m. I hadn’t been asleep for hours and hadn’t long left the room since I woke up, but my phone still showed that message. Again, it's just some stupid joke right? Some kids who lived relatively nearby found out that they could mess with the network name and prayed that somebody would pay attention to it. 

I didn't want to tell myself that somebody was really watching me, somebody REALLY knew when I was relaxing, knew when I was going to bed. My stomach churned at the idea of that. 

The relief that I felt when I was finally set to leave was like no other. Prank or not, it had successfully unsettled me. 

I’d been on the road for about 45 minutes when I pulled into a gas station to fill up. The anxiety still clung to me, but I figured a coffee and a stretch would help clear my head. Maybe I was overthinking things. Maybe I’d just been in the car for too long the day before staying at the place. I grabbed a coffee, made small talk with the attendant, then stepped outside to the pump. I couldn't help but pull out my phone again, just to make sure I wasn't going crazy. Normally, at a gas station that had free Wi-Fi, you'd see something like "Gas&Go Free WiFi", right? 

I know people won't believe this next part but please, if there's anybody who knows anything, help me out? Could I have been hacked? Because when I checked, there were multiple networks to connect to. 

‘I’mStillWithYou.’ 

The words were clear. Not just some glitch or prank anymore. I wasn’t even near the Airbnb at this point. I was at a gas station, miles away, and somehow, this... this THING had followed ME. It was on my device. 

My stomach dropped. I disconnected from the Wi-Fi, but when I looked at my phone again, it had reconnected automatically. The network name hadn’t changed. It was still there. ‘I’mStillWithYou.’

It's been a few days now and there's been nothing else. No weird cryptic messages anywhere, but.. I'm still on edge, y'know? I felt that people might be rational here and confirm my beliefs that it was somehow a prank, even at the gas station. Any tech savvy people who can ease my mind? I'd appreciate it.
