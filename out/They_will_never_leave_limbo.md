Hey Anon! I'm going to add my mom's story to the creepy pasta list. I'm not a great writer, but I hope it will be readable. She works in the police and below is the story in her own words:

\---

It all started with a job search, as many things do. A young man, much like my son, turned to various resources in a desperate attempt to find employment. After hundreds of attempts, he didn't expect to hear back from anyone, let alone receive a personal message with an invitation to an interview. But he got it. It was a very simple message describing general information about the position.

The only requirement was to download an application and complete a test shift. It all sounded like a scam, but the guy decided to give it a shot. Strangely enough, he wasn't asked to enter any personal information. Unfortunately, all we know is that he saw a creepy avatar of the person who messaged him. The avatar depicted a chalk-pale, smiling man with red, bloodshot eyes.

The app was a grotesque and disturbing game, where the player was tasked with collecting the blood of sinners and using it to build a soul-destroying tower.

The imagery was sickening and twisted, but something about it drew him in. When “the shift” was over, the game simply closed and he received 2,000 units of local currency for his efforts. And it didn't stop there.

Soon enough, a whopping 2,000 pounds were deposited into his account from an unknown source. The guy didn't ask questions or think twice, it didn’t matter to him how a strange company got his account number. The lure of easy money was too strong to resist, and the young man continued to play the game. He became more and more obsessed with it, neglecting his studies and eventually cutting off communication with his friends and family.

The young man's parents grew concerned when they couldn't locate him in the student dormitory, and none of his friends had any idea where he had gone. The police decided to investigate. We searched his messages and correspondence and found a lead to a rented apartment in an unfamiliar area. The building's cameras confirmed that he had stopped leaving the place altogether. 

We visited an apartment where the boy had presumably been staying for weeks. His mother had found a spare key in the mailbox, as they had taught their kids, so we were able to enter the apartment without barging in. As soon as we entered, the stench of decay hit us like a wall. It was very dark, with almost no lights. We could hear the sounds of typing and mumbling coming from one of the rooms, where some weak lights were visible. We were certain that someone was in the apartment, yet this person remained ominously unfazed by our intrusion. We cautiously marched in.

The only source of light came from the sinister red glow of the laptop screen.The air was thick with the smell of death, and it seemed to be coming from the young man himself. His skin was gray and mottled, his eyes red and bulging, and his face twisted into a grotesque and terrifying smile. The word "TERMINATED" had been scratched into the walls in a vicious manner. But that wasn't the most disturbing thing - his fingers were mutilated, with all of his fingernails missing and his skin covered in deep cuts and bruises. The young man looked at his parents with a demented glint in his eye and whispered the chilling phrase: "THEY WILL NEVER LEAVE LIMBO."

As you see my mom was one of the officers who arrived at the scene. The investigation was difficult and convoluted, as the source of the app remained a mystery. All the deposits were made using cryptocurrency, so they couldn’t find any traces. The young man's parents were devastated, and my mom was haunted by the memory of the twisted smile for months afterwards. It was a case that never quite left her, no matter how many other disturbing cases she worked on.
