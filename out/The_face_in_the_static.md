I’ve never been one for old tech, but when I found the CRT TV at a garage sale for five bucks, I couldn’t resist. It was a bulky, ancient thing, all knobs and dials, the kind my grandparents had in their living room. The seller, an old man with shaky hands, seemed eager to get rid of it. “Works fine,” he mumbled, avoiding my eyes. “Just don’t watch it too late.” I laughed it off, handed him the cash, and lugged the beast home to my apartment.

I set it up in my living room, more for the retro vibe than anything else. Hooked it up to an old VCR I had from a thrift store score and popped in a random tape I’d found in a box labeled “misc.” The screen flickered to life, spitting out static and snow, but after some fiddling with the antenna, I got a grainy picture. The tape was some old home movie—kids playing in a backyard, birthday candles, nothing special. I left it running as background noise while I cooked dinner.

That’s when I first saw it. The tape ended, and the screen went to static, but in the white noise, there was... something. A shape, faint, like a face pressing through the static, watching me. I froze, spatula in hand, staring at it. The face didn’t move, didn’t blink, just hovered there, indistinct but undeniably human. I unplugged the TV, heart racing, and told myself it was just pareidolia—my brain making patterns where there weren’t any. Old TVs do that, right?

The next night, I couldn’t resist turning it on again. No tape this time, just the static. The face was back, clearer now. It was a woman, I think, with hollow eyes and a mouth that seemed to stretch too wide. She didn’t move, but I swear she was looking right at me. I changed the channel, hoping for a signal, but every station was the same—static, and her face, staring. I yanked the plug again and shoved the TV into a closet.

I couldn’t sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her, that stretched mouth, those empty eyes. Around 2 a.m., I heard it: a low hiss, like static, coming from the closet. I told myself it was impossible—the TV wasn’t plugged in. But the sound grew louder, and with it, a whisper, too faint to make out but heavy with intent. I didn’t dare open the closet door.

The next day, I searched online for anything about the TV’s brand—a no-name model from the ‘80s, long out of production. I found a forum post buried in an archive, written by someone claiming their TV “trapped things.” They described a face in the static, watching them, whispering their name. The post ended abruptly, with no follow-up. The user’s account was gone.

I decided to get rid of the TV. I dragged it to the curb, left a “free” sign on it, and went back inside. But when I checked an hour later, it was back in my living room, cord coiled neatly, screen dark. I hadn’t told anyone about it, and my apartment was locked. I smashed the screen with a hammer, glass shattering everywhere, and hauled the pieces to a dumpster across town. I thought that was the end.

Last night, I woke up to the hiss of static. My laptop, which I’d left closed on my desk, was open, screen glowing with snow. Her face was there, clearer than ever, mouth moving like she was trying to speak. I slammed the laptop shut, but the sound didn’t stop. It was coming from my phone, my speakers, even the walls. And then, a whisper, clear as day: **“You can’t turn me off.”**

I’m typing this from a library computer because I don’t trust my devices anymore. The static follows me—faint, but always there, in the background of every call, every video, every quiet moment. I see her face in reflections now, not just screens. The mirror, the window, even a puddle on the street. She’s getting closer.

If you’ve ever seen a face in the static, if you know what she wants, please tell me. I don’t know how much longer I can keep her out.
