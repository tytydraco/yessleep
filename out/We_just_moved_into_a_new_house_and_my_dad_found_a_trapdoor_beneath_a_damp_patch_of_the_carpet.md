“The realtor certainly never mentioned *this*,” He said.

A putrid scent filled the lounge. It hadn’t been there when we viewed the property, but it certainly made itself known once Dad purchased the place. Isn’t that always the way?

I lack the vocabulary to accurately describe it. It smelt wretched, and that’s generous. It was the smell of sewage left to stew at the foot of a festival Portaloo, but even Glastonbury’s toilets would have been preferable to this. It was more than a smell. Dense, clammy air clung to my skin. It carried something heavy. Something vile. Even a shower didn’t seem to scrub away those pungent particles.

The days went by, and the scent worsened. It breached the living room’s borders, wafting through the house. But one week after living in our new home, Dad solved the mystery. We moved the bulky, mahogany cabinet away from the corner of the lounge, and he heroically fist-pumped the air — the thick, revolting air.

The stench had been strengthening as we waddled the piece of furnishing away from the wall, and the reason became clear when we looked down at the carpet. There lay a damp, mouldy patch at our feet. The source of the *godawful* smell that had been violating our senses for seven torturous days.

My dad wasted no time in peeling up the carpet to see what it was hiding. To see what had been assaulting our senses. The last thing I expected was a wooden trapdoor built into ancient floorboards, but that was exactly what we found. Still, we knew that we weren’t just smelling damp, rotten wood. Something turned my stomach several times, and it was more than the smell.

“Do you think the previous owners put it there?” I asked in a nasally tone, pinching my nose to seal my nostrils.

“Mr and Mrs Dowdy? They were a little forgetful in their old age, I suppose,” Dad shrugged, before bending down to inspect the circular iron handle. “But this is a Victorian house. It’s been refurbished quite a few times. I’d imagine Mr and Mrs Dowdy wouldn’t have ever looked beneath the carpet.”

“The two of them must have noticed this terrible smell during their fifty years here,” I scoffed, almost choking on a laugh as I inhaled the rotten air.

Dad smiled. “Maeve, did you never *smell* Mr and Mrs Dowdy? They hadn’t showered in a long-time. I think they were nose-blind.”

I snorted.

“Joking aside, the smell must be a recent development. It certainly wasn’t like this when we looked around the property, was it?” My dad asked, curling his fingers around the handle. “I am intrigued to see what’s down there though…”

“Just don’t fiddle with anything structural,” I said, looking at the cabinet we’d shuffled to one side. “I’m fairly certain that piece of furniture might’ve been holding the ceiling up.”

The trapdoor did not creak, but *screamed* as it opened. A high-pitched shriek of relief at having been uncovered after heaven-knows-how-many decades of neglect. I reflexively moved my hands to my ears, but quickly realised that the stench was worse than the deafening groan of the old, iron hinges, and quickly moved one hand back to my nose.

“Jesus *wept*,” My dad spluttered, pulling out his phone.

“At least put a peg over your nose,” I said. “Who knows what you’re inhaling?”

He turned on the torch, cast it into the hole, then uttered a meek hum of curiosity.

“Water,” He said.

I looked over the edge of the square-shaped opening. Below, there swam water so thick and revolting that it revealed only our disgusted reflections. However, for a moment, the opaque sludge bulged, as if something were threatening to break the tension of the surface.

“Might be a burst sewer pipe,” Dad suggested.

“We should probably call someone who knows,” I said.

“Gary!” He loudly replied, snapping his fingers. “He’s a pal. He’ll help… Right, I’ll close this before we pass out.”

He heaved the weighty door over, removing the mysterious water from sight, but not smell. Strangely, however, I no longer cared about the awful aroma. In fact, I’d stopped pinching my nose. I was too busy contending with the painful shiver coursing through my body. Too busy fearing whatever I’d seen below the water. Or, rather, whatever I’d *almost* seen. The clotted waste had revealed nothing below its revolting surface.

I spent the rest of the evening in the kitchen. Even after dinner, when Dad tried to convince me to relax in the lounge with him.

“Come on, Mae!” He shouted. “It doesn’t smell *that* bad in here. Well, it probably does, but I think my nerves have been obliterated at this point.”

I eventually summoned the courage to enter the living room. “I’m going to bed.”

“At half nine?” Dad asked. “I’ve not seen you go to bed before midnight in *years*.”

I tried to ignore that damp patch of carpet, but the goose pimples on my nape were too present. I twisted, shooting an accusatory glare at the corner of the carpet, and my breathing steadied slightly. There was nothing on the carpet but that foul-smelling stain.

“Gary’s coming over first thing in the morning,” Dad promised, noticing my haunted eyes. “He’ll have a proper look under there, and he won’t leave until he’s found some sort of solution.”

I spent the next few hours lying in my unlit bedroom and doom-scrolling on Reddit. Hoping that a healthy dose of brain rot might quell that persistent fear beneath the sludgy surface of my mind.

*Did I really see something in the water?*

I didn’t know whether I wanted an answer to that question.

When Dad came up to bed, the house fell silent, and my dread amplified. There was nobody to keep an eye on the lounge’s carpet. And that was all I thought when the sound of rustling woke me at five in the morning, shortly before dawn. The sound of something shuffling against the carpet. Not large, booming footsteps.

It was the sound of something *swimming* through the carpet bristles on the upstairs landing.

I would’ve chalked it up to my father sleepwalking, as he was prone to doing that, but there were no creaking floorboards. It was a horribly quiet noise. I didn’t want to find the source, but I was terrified of it finding *me*.

I shuffled out of bed on unwilling legs and tentatively opened the door. Then my lips followed suit as I uttered a meek sound of terror.

A wet, slimy trail ran along the entire length of the landing. It stopped at the end of the hallway, curved, and returned to the stairs. Given the repellent smell, I knew it originated from that dreadful place below the carpet. Below our home.

With quaking limbs, I tiptoed around the wet streaks, not wanting my bare toes to touch the unknown substance. And when I reached the top of the landing, I stopped. I was halted by something in the lobby, illuminated by the street-lamp glaring through the front door’s glass pane. My eyes were drawn to the coat hooks along the wall. The dirty mat below them.

There hung a long, navy trench coat which draped down, resting neatly on a pair of leather walking boots.

I knew, even from the top of the stairs, that the outfit was damp. The scent of mould carried up the steps. And there was the telltale sign of that wet trail leading from the stairs to the mat. Then from the mat to the living room. To its point of origin. The sludgy carpet streaks told a petrifying story. One confirmed by a sudden sound from the lounge.

A wooden door clunking closed.

I clasped my mouth to silence the primal scream striving to escape, then I stumbled backwards. My heel pressed into one of the damp trails, and a second scream filled my throat. I thought of what had caused that trail. Tried *not* to think of it. Then I scurried back to my room and slammed the door behind me.

I stood with my hands pressed against the wood, holding it closed for the next hour. Eyes twitching, but barely blinking, as I sealed myself in the room. A lifetime later, I felt the dawning sun pour through the gap between my curtains, but I only dared to take my hands away from the door when I heard my dad leave his bedroom.

“Maeve?” He called from the hallway. “What is *this*?”

With trembling hands, I opened the bedroom door and eyed the carpet below. The wet trails had dried, and my father was grimacing at the crusty streaks of unidentifiable muck beneath his feet.

“Is this from the…” He trailed off, retching slightly. “Did you open the trapdoor, Mae?”

I shook my head, before taking unsteady steps towards the end of the landing. My dad followed me downstairs, calling my name repeatedly, and I started to shake as I realised that all of the night’s events had truly happened.

“Mae, I’m talking to…” Dad paused, eyeing the new trench coat and boots in the downstairs hallway. “Wait, when did you put those there? They look a little big for you.”

“I think we need to go,” I quivered.

“*You* need to go,” He said. “You’ve got work. I’ve taken the day off to sort this mess. Gary’s coming over, remember?”

“I don’t feel well,” I gulped. “Please, Dad… Let’s go. Gary will understand.”

“Go where?” Dad asked as he eyed his phone. “Look, if you don’t want to be here whilst he deals with that mess in the living room, I understand. Go for a walk to get some fresh air. Just make sure you call the shop to let them know you won’t make your shift.”

“It’s not that, Dad,” I insisted, quaking. “Those clothes *aren’t* mine. I don’t know how–”

The obnoxious bray of a car horn interrupted me.

“Oh, that’ll be Gary,” He said, peeking through the window at the driveway. “As I said, Mae, if you fell unwell then–”

“– Are you *listening* to me, Dad?” I interrupted, practically yelling. “*Those clothes aren’t mine*. They appeared last night along with the wet patches on the carpet. Something’s wrong here. I heard something… I…”

Dad raised an eyebrow, eyeing me with concern. “Those aren’t your clothes? I don’t…”

There came three knocks, and my father threw the door open to his middle-aged friend. The plumber showcased a belly optimistically covered by a small T-shirt, and a receding hairline optimistically covered by a dishevelled comb-over.

“Good to see you, Paul,” Gary said, slapping my father on the back. “And little Maeve! You’ve shot up over the past year. Blimey. Back from uni?”

“Just for the summer holidays,” Dad said. “She’s been working at Oxfam.”

“Oh, aye? The little shop down the road?” He asked.

“Dad…” I whispered. “May I talk to you for a second?”

Gary chortled. “Uh oh, Paul. Sounds serious.”

“It’ll be fine, Mae,” Dad insisted, waving his hand at the coat and boots. “You know I sleepwalk. I probably took Mum’s advice in the middle of the night and, I don’t know, decided to do a bit of spring cleaning. I don’t remember buying half of the things I own.”

Gary grew sombre. “Oh, I’m sorry, mate. I didn’t realise you two were talking about Maria.”

Dad shook his head. “We weren’t, Gary. It’s just been a strange morning. That’s all.”

“A strange week, by the sounds of it,” He said, heading into the living room. “Sweet *Jesus*. You weren’t lying. This place *stinks*.”

I fearfully following my dad and the plumber into the lounge, but it looked no different. I wanted to scream at my father not to lift up the trapdoor, and when Gary gasped, I imagined the worst.

“That’s disgusting,” The plumber gasped, placing a palm over his nose. “Never in my twenty years of… Is that *sewage*? No, it smells worse than sewage.”

“Is it a plumbing issue?” My dad asked.

“The only way to find out would be for me to…” Gary exhaled deeply. “… go down there. And I’d rather not catch some horrendous disease. I’d like to calculate the size of this hole first. I need something to gauge the depth.”

“You could use one of my old pool cues,” Dad said. “They’re collecting dust in the downstairs cupboard.”

“I could,” Gary nodded, smiling. “But *would* you be okay with that? You’d have to chuck it in the rubbish afterwards.”

Dad returned with a pool cue moments later and handed it to Gary. Then the plumber, without any announcement, plunged the rod into the sludge. The unknown liquid, which was practically solid, released a squelch as the wooden tool sank into it. I was surprised when the makeshift measuring device thudded against something, as I’d convinced myself that the hole would be a bottomless pit.

“Only seems to be about a metre deep,” Gary said, sloshing the cue around in the toxic water. “Now, if I just… Oh, I think I’ve found something.”

As the pool cue wiggled in the toxic sludge, it rapped against something that clattered loudly, sending small vibrations through the floorboards. Dad wore a concerned expression on his face, but just before he warned Gary to stop, there came a crumbling sound, followed by the rushing of water.

The rushing of *air*.

Dad grasped my arm as I flew forwards, but he wasn’t fast enough to save his friend. The plumber had already been peering over the edge of the hole, eyeing the draining water with curiosity, before he suddenly tumbled into it. We expected the man’s legs to lift uncomfortably into the air. Expected to see Gary performing some crumpled, cramped handstand in the hole which was, supposedly, only a metre deep.

However, the man disappeared *entirely* into the waste. And then the rushing air ceased, as did the draining water.

Dad and I peeked tentatively into an empty hole built from red bricks. A small, rusty tap hung from the left-hand wall, but it did not seem to connect to any pipes. It had brought the unearthly water from some unknown place. Clumpy water that had drained through a hole in the floor of the ditch. Gary had knocked a brick loose.

“Where did he *go*?” Dad wailed. “He couldn’t have slipped through the hole… That’s impossible…”

Then there came a rumble from the bottom of the brick box. A rumble not from the earth quaking but from something unthinkably mighty making its way out of Earth’s depths. Though it came from somewhere else. I know that now. Another brick fell away. Followed by another. And another.

Dad shone his phone torch into the opening with a shaking hand, and the pair of us screamed.

In the blackness below the hole’s crumbling brick floor, we saw a figure crawling up a dirt tunnel, moving with insect-like agility in spite of its large presence. The torch revealed a rotten hand and the sleeve of a navy trench coat.

We didn’t wait to see its face.

I screamed, and my dad yanked me backwards. Pulled me away from the hole and out of the living room. Whilst he unlatched the front door, my eyes remained glued to the living room door. And from the hole’s opening, I saw not a hand, but a long, skeletal leg. Its decaying flesh flapped in the breeze gushing up from the ditch. Stemming from some horrible underworld that was surely its home. And on the end of the rotten stump was a large, leather walking boot that quickly slammed to the carpet.

Something was lifting itself out by its feet. But Dad tore my frozen form out of the front door before I had a chance to see what would come.

That was one week ago. We haven’t returned to our home, and we don’t plan on doing so. We called the police, but they found nothing when they inspected the property. Obviously, Dad omitted the supernatural details of our tale, as he knew they wouldn’t believe him. Knew it would only make him seem culpable for Gary’s disappearance.

Wherever my dad’s friend has gone, I pray that he has met some sort of end. To live in some murky, underwater world with that thing in the long coat and the walking boots? That’s a nightmare I wouldn’t wish on [anyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
