[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l46qn9/i_keep_finding_creepy_surprise_gifts_inside_my/)

I swear to God if any of you comment saying this story is now ‘cerealized’, I’m not posting again. Honestly, I’ve heard enough cereal puns this week to last me a lifetime.

Anyway, things have gotten even weirder since my last post. For those wondering, yes, I did report my thumb tack incident to the knock-off brand and they replied the next day.

They apologized profusely, gave me a PO box to send the packaging to, and launched an ‘detailed internal investigation’. They got back to me a week later saying they'd found two different types of adhesive on the end tabs of the box and the inner wrapper, suggesting the product had become 'compromised' and resealed somewhere between leaving the factory line and hitting the store shelf. They said they’ve since sent a memo out warning their suppliers and issued a product recall, so hopefully you guys won’t be accidentally eating that stuff anytime soon.

The next part of their email was basically legal mumbo jumbo covering their asses before saying although they weren't technically at fault ‘due to the packaging being compromised outside their facility’, as a gesture of goodwill they'd like to offer me two hundred dollars’ worth of grocery vouchers and also a life time supply of their cereal. I turned down the cereal for obvious reasons but took the vouchers, mainly because I needed them to help fund my own ‘internal investigation’.

After my mouth had fully healed, I went back to the superstore to try to get back into a routine, but also to gather more evidence. I was a lot more wary as I walked the aisles, second guessing anyone who said hello or who so much as glanced my way. Even if they didn’t work there, they could still be the one behind the evil ‘surprise gifts’.

I stayed in the store for nearly an hour, not really adding much to my basket and mostly just scoping the place out. I did a circuit of the cereal aisle at least four times, trying to memorize which boxes were there when I’d first entered the store and whether any new boxes had somehow made their way onto the shelves since—perhaps with a ‘special’ surprise inside. As far as I could tell, cereal had only either left the shelves or moved slightly due to other customers rather than any members of staff.

On my final lap, I picked up the samples for my experiment consisting of six boxes of cereal in total; two from each available brand, one from the front of the shelf and one from the very back. My theory was that whoever was targeting me was placing the spiked box or boxes near the front of the shelves whenever they saw me coming in the hopes I’d bite.

Perhaps if I gathered enough of their ‘surprise gifts’ I could pass them along to the police as evidence and either get them, or the store manager (assuming it wasn’t them all along) to cross-check the contaminated packages against any in-store CCTV.

I was glad to see the off-brand Cap’n Crunch was no longer on the shelves due to the recall, and used some of the vouchers the manufacturers had gifted me to pay for my shopping before heading home.

As soon as I got in, I dumped the rest of the bags, and put on some safety gloves and glasses I’d borrowed from work before opening any of the cereal. After what had happened with the thumb tacks, I wasn’t taking any chances.

My heart was racing, but I forced myself to work slowly and methodically. The first box was clean, and so too was the second, but that didn’t calm my nerves. It wasn’t until I opened the final box and emptied the contents onto the surface to find nothing but chunks of cereal that I felt my fear deflate into a strange sense of disappointment.

“Huh?” I muttered, finally tugging the safety specs off.

All six boxes were completely fine. My experiment was a dud and I had no new evidence to pass along.

I felt my stomach growl at the sight of the sea of cereal in front of me, but forced myself to grab something else to eat instead whilst I worked out what to do next. Maybe now I’d reported them, whoever had been spiking the cereal had decided to lay low for a while?

I’d just tugged the plastic clip off the loaf of bread and watched the first slice fall over when I realized my mistake.

They had been one step ahead of me the whole time.

There, running right through the loaf of sliced bread was a rectangular, hollowed-out hole and inside it sat two new ‘surprise gifts’—both wrapped inside hygiene sealed, see-through packets.

“Of course…”

After the thumb tacks they must have figured I’d be put off cereal and would eat something else instead. Leaving the gloves on, I carefully pulled out the surprise packets. One was a box of painkillers and the other was a small ‘Get Well Soon’ card with an overly smiley face on. Somehow, the card creeped me out more than the single condom had done. It was the fact they knew they’d caused me harm with the thumb tacks, and I could tell the card was insincere. Sure enough, I carefully peeled open the wrapping on the card in the hopes of finding some kind of handwriting to identify them with, but it was blank. They just wanted me to know they were watching.

Feeling dumb, and slightly angry, I pulled out a bin bag and put the bread, painkillers and card inside to try to preserve my new evidence. Surely, I had enough to go to the police with now?

Realizing I now needed to get a new loaf of bread, I decided to walk to the nearby convenience store instead to clear my head. I grabbed another pack of sliced white and, to prove a point to myself: one more box of cereal. I figured if a ‘surprise gift’ was inside either of them too then the problem wasn’t just at that one superstore after all, and was far bigger and more surreal than I’d first thought.

Thankfully, both bread and cereal were fine and I felt some sense of balance return to my small world. Feeling like I had more of a handle on the problem now, I made myself a sandwich and headed off to work.

I spent the first half of my shift in a sour mood, not knowing what to make of anything or who to trust anymore. Despite my lunch having been tucked safely away in my locker, I still picked apart my sandwich in my break before eating it on the off chance it’d somehow been spiked whilst I’d been away.

“You okay man?” My workmate asked as he caught me staring at the contents of my sandwich, splayed out in front of me.

“Yeah, just…tired.”

“You and me both pal. I tell ya, these night shifts—they fuck with your head.”

I grunted and carried on with my shift, feeling like a bug in a petri dish. How could someone at that store know my routine so well they could guess exactly what I’d buy before I even knew. Was I really that predictable?

I spent the rest of my shift trying to guess which of the superstore staff could possibly hold a grudge against me but ultimately drew a blank. It wasn’t until I clocked out that I realized I’d been so freaked out by the blank ‘Get Well Soon’ card that I hadn’t even opened the second ‘surprise gift’ from earlier—the box of painkillers.

As soon as I got back, I went straight to the kitchen to fish out the packet from the bin bag. I tore it open, half thinking it’d be just a pack of pills and another dead end, only to find something far stranger.

‘WINNER!’ the foil wrapper tucked inside the pill box screamed.

Fearing the worst, I put the safety gloves and glasses back on and carefully opened it to find a cinema ticket. I had to read the ticket at least three times to make sense of it. It seemed to be to a showing of a film called ‘2:30’, only it was showing at ‘9:10’ in the morning i.e. within the next hour. I quickly Googled the name of the cinema and realized it was on the other side of town.

Suddenly I not only felt like a bug inside a petri dish, but could almost feel the gigantic magnifying glass hanging over my head. Was someone just watching me, or about to burn me alive?

Knowing my window for answers would close if I didn’t leave now, I grabbed my coat and headed out the door.

The cinema was dead, which considering it was first thing in the morning in the middle of the week, was hardly a surprise. The dead-eyed attendant checked my ticket and pointed me to the screen at the end of the hall with a zombie like grunt. I didn’t bother asking if they’d heard of the film ‘2:30’ before even though I sure has hell hadn’t.

I was the only one inside the screen but chose a seat in the middle of the room, yet at the end of a row, figuring I could make a quick getaway if I needed to. I sat through the obligatory barrage of adverts and cellphone warnings before finally, the movie started.

There was no credit sequence, no musical score, just a straight cut to the title card ‘2:30’ followed by a grainy view of someone’s basement. There were tools on the walls and a rickety chair with someone frail and unconscious tied to it.

Whoever was holding the camera panned it up to show a pair of rusty pliers inside a gloved hand. There was no sound but I could tell what was about to go down before the unseen assailant even stepped towards their victim.

“Oh Christ,” I moaned aloud, as it finally dawned on me what the title of the film actually meant (tooth-hurty) before glancing around to spot a guy sitting two rows behind me, wearing a hoodie and staring straight at me.

The draw strings on his hood were pulled tight across his face, like he was going for a run in the middle of winter, leaving a black hole where his face should have been. I didn’t know if the film I’d been led here to see was some budget found footage horror, or a genuine snuff film, but in that moment I forgot about the damn film as real horror was two rows behind me.

My legs stood up before I even told them to. The guy stood up too. Behind me, the snuff film carried on playing to itself. Figuring this was where I got off the crazy train, I forced myself to walk back up the aisle, past the figure, trying to act as nonchalantly as possible despite my heart pounding like a drum.

I side-eyed the man as I passed and saw the hollow of his hood turn to watch me leave. I left the screen, and speed walked towards the foyer, hearing the screen door open again behind me.

I didn’t look back. I knew he was following.

The foyer was empty—the popcorn stand not even switched on it was so early. I power-walked to the exit and jogged down the steps before taking off down the street.

It was light outside, making me feel slightly safer, so I risked a glance over my shoulder yet the sight of the guy in the black hoodie barrelling down the cinema steps made me whisk back around. He was wearing matching black joggers and sneakers and was built like he’d spent the past two decades in the gym.

I started sprinting but I didn’t stand a chance. I got a stitch before I reached the carpark and felt his huge hand yank on the collar of my coat before I reached my car. He spun me around and shoved me against the side of a white van. For one terrifying moment, I thought he was about to abduct me but he just shouted in my face instead, making me flinch.

“Are you the guy?”

“What?” I squealed.

“The guy that's been hiding stuff in my whey powder?”

“No!”

“Then why were you running?”

“I thought that was you—it’s been happening to me too!” Shaking like a leaf, I pulled out the cinema ticket from my pocket. “Look, I got a ticket to that showing.”

“What the hell was that movie, dude?”

“I dunno: you tell me?”

I finally opened my eyes and stopped cowering enough to look at him. He looked in his forties, rough shaven and haggard.

“Fuck. They're in my fucking head man, I swear…”

He let me go then and stormed off, looking dazed.

I stood there, doubled over, trying to catch my breath for a good few minutes after that. When I finally calmed down, I looked around the carpark to check no more gym ninjas were trying to jump me before heading back home to gather my thoughts.

I was too rattled to sleep so I decided to make a coffee in the hopes of getting some kind of brain wave. I opened the coffee canister, dug in the teaspoon and instantly regretted it. As soon as I heard the same telltale crunch of plastic wrapper that’d haunted my life for the past month, I dropped the canister like a live wire.

The coffee granules scattered over the floor but the ‘surprise’ packet somehow landed on my foot. The thing inside was small, white and looked just like a tooth. Even from this distance I could see the flecks of blood on it.

At the same time as I figured out what the hell was on my foot, I also realized whoever had put the tooth inside the coffee canister must have broken into my apartment, and could still be here.

In a blind panic, I kicked the tooth away and ran out of the apartment. I banged on my neighbors door until they let me in and together we called the cops. They arrived within the hour and I told them everything, starting from the very beginning, with the toy alien.

They recovered the shrink-wrapped tooth from my apartment and a few hours later, I was in a police interview room being grilled by two of their detectives. Both were middle-aged, pot-bellied and balding and I could tell neither were taking me seriously.

“So, you’re telling me, someone knew in advance exactly what box of cereal you were going to buy out of the hundreds on the shelves, planted some thumb tacks inside them and you ate them?”

“By accident, yes…”

“And someone working at the store is responsible for targeting you, and the individual you encountered earlier?”

“Yes, someone who must know our routines.”

“And who might that be?”

“I dunno—maybe my old class mate, or maybe even the store manager.”

“Oh yeah, how come?”

“Look, it must be someone who works at the store and has some kind of connection to that cinema. I mean how else could they have played that film otherwise?”

“We've checked with the cinema and that screen was closed for maintenance today.”

“Then how do you explain the ticket? Surely that's evidence enough right there.”

“Evidence you've compromised by opening,” the other detective chimed in, arms folded.

“Is the tooth real?” I asked them.

“We can't comment on that.”

“So it is then?” I guessed. “This is some kind of serial killer, isn't it?”

The partner scoffed, “More like a cereal killer, amma right?”

The other facepalmed, “Really, Jerry?”

“What?” Jerry shrugged.

The other, sterner detective turned back to me and said, “Look, if you find something else, here's my card. In the meantime, stay safe and maybe skip breakfast for now?”

“No kidding.”

That interview had been two days ago and a cop car is still parked outside my apartment. I don't know if it’s standard procedure, and they're just keeping me safe, or if they’re actually staking me out. After all, I must be a suspect to end up so tied up in all of this mess?

My paranoia is spiralling and I’m eating nothing but tinned food. I’m scared I’m starting to become like that sketchy guy in the hoodie. I didn't notice until I got home but the detective who gave me his card is called Detective Winner, which reminded me of the ‘WINNER!’ wrapper inside that box of painkillers. That’s just got to be a coincidence, right?

P.S. A buttload of that knock-off cereal just arrived, even though I specifically said I didn't want a life time’s supply. I'm talking fifty boxes. My hallway is full of the stuff. What am I supposed to do with all of it? Send it back? What if more comes next month?

P.P.S. a second delivery just came, an overnight fast-tracked parcel—the heavy-duty black plastic wrapped kind with no return address. I opened it up and it’s full of creepy pre-packaged 'surprise gifts’, everything from small toys to unused single rounds of 9mm ammunition, to razor blades…

There was another tin foil 'WINNER!' wrapper inside just like in the painkiller box. I've just ripped it open and all it says on the piece of paper inside is 'You know the drill’.

Shit, I feel like I’m being framed, or maybe...initiated? What the hell do I do?
