I couldn’t remember for the life of me if I had locked the door or not.

I always did.  Well, usually.  Once or twice I recall getting ready to leave for the day and finding that I’d left the door unlocked.  There was one way in and out of the guest house I lived in.  Would anyone ever try to break in?  Nah.  But you just lock the door.  It’s not worth the risk.  Doesn’t make sense to leave it unlocked, so you lock it.

But did I?

I hated the noise I was hearing.  I hated that I hadn’t bought new glasses and I was lying in bed without contacts in.  I could see on my phone: 12:52 AM.  No, wait.  2:52 AM.  
This was a quiet road in a small, northern Michigan town.  Alanson.  More-trees-than-people type of place.  I rarely saw the lady who lived in the main house.  Our main contact was my monthly rent payment with a “Thanks” on Venmo.  A quiet place, a quiet life.  My ticket to not drinking myself to death, I thought.  I left the stress behind and didn’t think the urge to drink would hit so hard. 
And yet the outline of the face in the window had me desperate to down an entire bottle of anything.  
Was it a face?   God damn it.  I can’t tell.   Is it back? 
It is there.  It’s absolutely there.  It’s moving slightly.  It’s a face.  
What the fuck is that sound?  The face is gone. 
I stand up to the window.  Nothing is there.  It’s darkness, trees, grass, the rustling of leaves in the night breeze.  That scratching sound is gone, and so is the low groan.  Nope…I heard the groan again.  God damn it.  I’m going to my fridge.
First I check the door.  It was unlocked.  Nice, idiot.  Well, it’s locked now.  Fridge.  Good, about half of the half-gallon of Nikolai is left.  Almost a full 2-liter of Sprite.  My mix these days is about 1:1, over some ice in a reusable 7-11 cup.  I slam it.  Another round.  This fixes everything. 
If I kill myself by drinking, I’ve got nothing left to fear.  
I think I can feel the vodka working already.  Old reliable.  Don’t even worry about how easy it would be to break into this stupid shack anyway, and how far away any kind of help is.  
God damn it, the sound is back.  Why don’t I own a gun?  Ha.  You know why.  Temptation.  It’d all be over.  But if I want to be dead so much, why be scared…?  What is…what am I seeing out the front window?  Is that two people?  No, just one.  Nobody?  Just lay the fuck back down, you’re losing it.  Get to sleep.  Such a long day of work tomorrow.  Work, stress, regret, doubts.  Turn my brain off!  Another long pull from the drink.  Another.  Another.  Another. 
Another.
Turn my brain off.  God I hate thinking about her.  And all of it.  It’s been seven years since we split.  Countries get over wars between each other sooner.  Why can’t I move on…  God I regret so much.
Another drink. 
It’s all right.  It’ll be over soon, won’t it?  I mean I can’t imagine that people who live like me are long for this world.  But I don’t want to die…I just want things to be better.  Maybe they will be.  Maybe I’ll quit this time and it’ll be like they say, being sober will start paying dividends right away, I’ll be rejuvenated, maybe I’ll even meet someone-

*RRRRRAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHWWWWAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRR* 

My blood is cold.  My spine is concrete.  What…ungodly sound

My brain can’t even process it.  Logical explanations…..must have been an animal.  What kind?  Why?  That loud?  How?  A joke?  A prank?  What is… I can’t process. 

It’s been a few minutes of stillness.  Silence.  I am made of stone.  Barely breathing, barely inhaling slightly through my nose.  A few more minutes.  Another long pull from the drink.  Another.
Another.

I think it’s okay.  Another.  Put on Netflix. Something light, funny.  Drift off.  Another.  Drift off.

SLAM SLAM SLAM

That’s a palm.  Hitting the window.  God I can’t believe it, what the fuck.  Why can’t I move.  I’m paralyzed.  The face is there.  It’s…not human.  It’s…
No.  Another.  Another refill?  Can I move? 

He's - it's? - inside the guest house.

Its eyes are glowing.  Fangs.  This can't be real. 

Darkness.  Finally, darkness.
