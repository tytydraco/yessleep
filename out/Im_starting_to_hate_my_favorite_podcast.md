I need to know if anybody can relate. I mean, hate is such a strong word but I feel so strange, unreal even. It could be disassociation, I guess. I've never been a shining example of mental health but still, this drastic switch of emotion has caught me completely off guard. I recently moved and this podcast had become something of a saving grace for me during the rewriting of my life. Let me just clarify that the podcast is like a mix of true crime and urban legend, something in between. Just two guys reading over scary stories or anything creepy in general, true or not. Reality is irrelevant. And after moving so far away from my home and everything I know, I often found myself listening to the rhythmic back and forth of their conversation. So invested id even respond and joke as if I were sitting right in front of them. With them, and while I unpacked boxes and brushed my teeth, they were with me.


It's hard to sit in the quiet of a new place that just doesn't feel like home yet. I say this to specify how much comfort these two people have provided me. How hours of thoughts and opinions exchanged over fascinating tales of horror have given me so much insight into these two perfectly curated personas. I felt like I knew them, like we were such close friends, sharing an interest in the mad and the macabre. I imagine sitting around a campfire trying your best to scare the other faces painted by the amber glow of flames. But making friends has never been a skill I possessed so naturally id befriend two guys on the internet who don't even know I exist. Sometimes even I wonder if I really exist. Regardless, I see how this can sound disconcerting and trust me if I had anybody to ask I would. But lately this podcast that has alleviated so much of my blank time has become something else for me. Don't get me wrong, I still wait for new uploads and watch every episode through. Rewatching when I crave more. Laughing and smiling all the while but recently, something else as well. Like an unwelcome guest lurking through a birthday party, like the rotten smell in your fridge when you're unable to find its source and it hit me just the same. Suddenly and without compromise.


I don't trust them. I know it sounds weird and I know I said I hate this podcast but I'm having a hard time trying to understand emotions. As if catching myself falling in a dream and jumping awake I came to the uncomfortable realization that these two I've spent so much time idolizing and admiring have now become strangers. Well, of course they're strangers to me and I knew that but for the first time, I felt it. I felt, betrayed? forsaken? I really don't know, I'm not crazy but it feels like,
“how dare they make me love their show! how dare they bring me joy! They've never even seen me!” 


It's crazy I'll admit but it's also exactly my point, how can a podcast about ghost stories bring out such a strong resentment in me? I've never been a jealous person, not paranoid, I'm hardly even superstitious. But I do not trust them anymore, and like a disease my suspicion spreads and turns every word from their mouth into a ploy to get me to put down my guard. Leaving me open to an incomprehensible horror that would leave Lovecraft himself shaking like a child. Excuse my hyperbole but I want to make it clear how heavy this blanket of unease is that has fallen over me. Feeling helpless and more isolated than I ever have in my entire existence, and the cause is something I thoroughly enjoy. Like the company of an unfaithful spouse.  So, here I am, looking for answers when I barley know the question. Can anybody help me?  Please.


Well, I didn't post this as I was planning to. I was still apprehensive about displaying my antisocial issues for the entire internet to dismantle and respond. Or maybe not respond at all, I'm still unsure which is scarier to me. So, I decided to give it a day and think it over, I thought maybe all this would fade and I could forget and avoid embarrassing myself for nothing. I didn't get the chance to think it over. The moment I finished typing my cry for help I received a notification. It was a new episode, early. My throat tightened as I could have sworn, I turned off all notifications for their channel. I opened another tab and their page was already there and instinctively I brought my curser over the video and clicked. The episode was not unusual, fun story, plenty of jokes and dissected plot points. It wasn't until exactly half way through when they did something strange.


Both hosts abruptly stopped laughing and looked at the camera with an expression I've never seen on a human before. Void of any discernible emotion. It didn't make sense; it had nothing to do with the story or any previous ones. I was too much of a fan to not get any reference they were trying to make. They just stared in silence for a couple of unbroken minutes and then the editing the just cut right back to where they left off. Laughing, warmly and deeply. I was frozen for the rest of the show, it felt like a trance. When I saw their eyes, it didn't feel like a video, it felt like a window. I sat for what felt like seconds staring at a black screen when it was over, until the rising sun told me I had been there all night. I couldn't bring myself to rewind and see if I saw what I saw so I went to bed. I've stayed awake through many nights, but none of them as easy as that. I woke up late this evening from a nightmare and while I can't remember the dream the unmistakable cold sweat and dread of a nightmare was still palpable. 


I can recount almost every bad dream I've ever had, but none has ever left me feeling like I was still waiting to wake up. I had to watch it again to be sure but I decided to start from the beginning and let it play, trying to bide my time. Before then I scoured the comments hoping id find somebody who mentions the anomaly. There was none, not one. So, I watched and waited, the middle mark came and went. My throat tightened again. It wasn't there, I skipped through the rest, went through it again and again but nothing. Worst fears realized; I've been spending the night in simmering anxiety. To be fair maybe the video glitched, or maybe it was part of my unidentified dream. I did stay up after all and I'm not usually one to get a full night's sleep anyway. I think I just need to step away from the internet for a while and get my head straight. Get some rest and stop fixating, I'll leave this here and hopefully soon I can just delete this whole file like it never happened.


I haven't been able to stop thinking, I don't sleep, I don't eat. Something bad is happening I can feel it, I feel this deception crawling into every aspect of my world and corrupting everything I held to be true. I haven't been online, but I still feel the grip of this energy everywhere I go. No matter what I do I can't shake that aching in my back when you've sat at the computer for too long and the blurring eye strain from staring at blue light for hours. Even when I'm outside it
seems like the sun is on rather than burning. My life feels like a downward spiral and I have nobody to confide in, nobody to assure me that everything's okay. This hasn't been a problem for me before, I like being alone but this doesn't feel like alone. This feels like damnation.


I went to the store today to try and find food; I know I have to eat. But lately everything outside my home makes no sense, what should be simple or clear feels complex and out of order. So, I just walked forward. Guided by something beyond myself. It wasn't long before I found myself standing by refrigerated coolers of raw meat. They caught my attention, the precise cuts wrapped up so neat you'd never guess they had ever been alive to begin with. But I knew they had been alive, because I felt it.


I felt the fear of being corralled and slaughtered in a sterile playground of machines and steel slabs. The pain of being strung up and bled. All of them. I felt the bolt that punctured their skulls and every cut that followed. Removing every piece until there was no body to be called me. Standing there, it felt like I had been dismembered and saran wrapped for all to see. Misery, Revile. The pain faded and was replaced with a morbid stillness as I saw every steak and pork chop twitch and beat and bleed. Like the muscles had awoken to panic being excavated from a corpse. Then stillness again. And as if days passed like seconds, they began to rot. Bloating, melting. From bright red to muddled brown, and brown to a slick green. Liquid fat and blood leaked forward and spilled at my feet while the maggots consumed and multiplied by the thousand but rather than become flies. They ate and died, to be fed upon by other maggots once the flesh was gone. It was impossible, it was the most horrible thing I've ever seen. The stench drove me away, all the way back to my laptop. I can't go on like this. Tortured by something greater than me. I'm not sure how to move on but I still have hope that I'll find some answers.


Am I being mocked for my hope? They're gone. The podcast is gone. The hosts. Everything. Maybe they deleted everything. All the socials, channels, uploads, photos, comments. It sounds tough but not impossible. But how? In three days, every trace is gone. What about the thousands of viewers they had? It's as if they never existed. Everything I search shows me nothing. I've been searching for hours and every empty-handed result has me reeling. When I thought it couldn't get worse, I've hit a new level of anxiety. If only I could talk to somebody, if I had a friend who could corroborate everything I've seen. At least so I wouldn't have to be alone and seemingly the only person with this corrosive knowledge. I think I'm going to leave this place, go back home. So far, all I've found here is fear and uncertainty. One day ill forget all about this and I'll meet some real people, and just like them I can be rid of my, favorite, podcast. I'll just have to remember my old address; I know I wrote it down somewhere.


I went to pack up my boxes, but everything's seemed to be packed already. Until I opened them and saw the hollow contents. I have no things; my place is empty but at this point that just makes it easier for me. I'm leaving and this ends today, I cannot be surrounded by this madness anymore. This has become a diary of me journaling what sounds like a script to a cheap horror movie, would sound fun if I could shake the feeling that those two are behind all of it. To say the least the distrust is as strong now as it's ever been, and I think it's safe to say I hate them.


It's been a little while since I've opened this document, I made it back to the home I knew before the hell that greeted me after my big move. All the hopes I had, reconnecting to people I use to know and being surrounded by familiar places and smells. It felt like a remedy to the sinister aching that has followed me for some time now. I was excited. Hopeful. Right up to the moment I stood before the empty plot where my childhood house once was. I felt shattered, I wasn't gone for that long. What about my family, where are they? Why can't I remember their phone numbers? Or their names. Did they disappear like the address on the sticky note I carried with me? I still feel lost, I know this place but familiarity has become a stranger to me.


Id driven around for hours before I had to park my car and cry to myself. My world is disappearing around me. My memories, names, faces. Gone like cigarette smoke in the breeze. It started with them, maybe they didn't have anything to do with it but were just the start of the death of everything I hold dear to me. I can't even remember the name of the podcast, the names of the hosts, what they looked like. Even they're age fluctuates like reflections in the ripples of a puddle. No. The eyes. I remember those eyes; they were looking at me. Seeing me. Thier eyes felt like my nightmare, they felt like my distrust, they felt like the fear that climbed up my throat and spilled out in a pile of bile. What does this mean? Why is my world being robbed from me, what did I do to be cursed with this torment. Is it because I noticed something I wasn't supposed to. Did I say something I wasn't supposed to. I've been weeping for hours now, just waiting for the next ring of hell to encircle me. But all I have is a ringing in my ears only broken by my desperate sobs. Please if there's a god, please help me, please help me.


What is written, nothing exists outside these words. I am confined to paragraphs and lines. This is hell. Fear, revile, misery, hate. I exist here, and only here. My world is not disappearing.  I am. For my story has reached its crescendo, and so have I. Every word has brought me closer to the end, my own end. Like a flame that crawls along the stick of a match, inevitably suffocating itself. I don't see, I don't sleep. I don't eat I don't breathe. I am here to be seen and to be read. No more no less. I understand now. I was never not this. No before and no after. What I thought was taken from me I never had. No purpose, no future. But I am here. 
prison.


My reality dictated by those beyond the veil of what I can reach, behind the screen. They see me. I wonder if I will be featured. Perhaps I will be read and showcased on a podcast, on a forum, are those gods of my world watching me now. Do they discuss my suffering, are they appeased, displeased? Am I seen at all, or will I be forgotten to time. My pain unknown to any higher mind. Will they know I'm here. Looking for them. The hosts, my gods, I hope they see me, I hope I am what I was made to be. I cannot hope for death, if I had eyes id close them and pretend, I was dead. But I am not alive. I am a scary story, here to entertain. Forever. I will always be here. Trapped just outside your vision.
