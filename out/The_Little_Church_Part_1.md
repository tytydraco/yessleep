Let me start by getting some disclaimers out of the way. I’m not going to tell you where the church is, or its name, I know there’s always a few brave people with nothing better to do but to go snooping around “spooky” places. Secondly, I have changed the names of everyone involved, as to protect the victims of this event. This is something I needed to get off my chest. 

I was always religious as a child. My parents took me and my younger brother to a little church in a rural town. It wasn’t a big church, but it was rather large for the area. It was located in a small town with about five hundred people, the church would average something like a hundred visitors every Sunday. It’s a funny thing, I remember as a child, I had always wanted to be a pastor. Now, all I want is to be as far away from religion as I can.
 
I don’t expect you to believe this story, I like to believe it was just a fever dream. Honestly, the idea that I’m a paranoid schizophrenic that fabricated the whole story is more comforting than believing that my memories of that church are true.

I’m twenty years old now, to be perfectly honest, I have not been the same person that I was before all of this happened. I was a very hopeful child, I had so many dreams for the future. Now I just feel like a shell of a person, sometimes I feel like I am only alive in the physical sense. My soul died eight years ago, when I stumbled upon something that I wouldn’t be able to process even now, God only knows how I haven’t blocked the events from my memory. Maybe it’s for you, to hear my story, and to hear my warning.

I was sitting in the back row of the sanctuary, bored out of my mind. My parents stood on the stage instruments in hand, pouring out their souls for worship practice. Both my mother and my father had led worship more times then I could count. I had often heard our senior pastor, Matthew, praising my parents for being “gifted in worship” and saying that God had provided these talents to my parents to “Bring glory to God” sure it sounds nice, but I always thought there was a particular effort to skirt around giving any actual credit to my parents for their hard work and dedication. They never accomplished anything, it was only God.

My younger brother Joshua was sitting next to me, “Andy, can we please go play?” 

“No Josh, do you want to get in trouble with Mrs. Madison again?” Helen Madison was the wife of one of the older church elders, and she had a very uptight and sour demeanor. She had caught me and Josh playing or being too loud on multiple occasions and scolded us. I wasn’t too keen on getting another talking to.

“Come on Andy, I'm bored.” Josh had raised his voice a little, and it almost panicked me.

“Sshhh, be quiet, the service will start soon, we can play when we get home.” It’s funny how much I sounded like my parents when I would get rowdy.

I stood up out of my chair, and Josh eyed me curiously, “I gotta use the bathroom, please, just be quiet.”

I had walked out the door of the sanctuary and down the hall to the bathroom, before I could enter, a small sobbing sound reached my ears. At the end of the hallway there were two chairs, usually they’d be used by mothers when their infant had begun to cry, they would rock back and forth consoling their child, and reenter the service once their baby had settled down.

The sobbing wasn’t coming from a baby though. Mr. and Mrs. Crowley sat in either of the chairs, with Pastor Matthew praying for them, a hand on both of their shoulders. I remember my mother had explained to me that their child George was missing. I remember that it didn’t bother me that much because I figured if someone was missing, it was just a matter of time before they were found. I was beginning to realize the error in my thinking. George had been missing for two months.

The police were never told about George. There wasn’t any law enforcement in our small town, you would have to drive a half hour to a slightly bigger town. But the church had a policy, the Lord would provide. It disgusts me to think back about it. It’s similar to churches that discourage modern medicine, that believe if God wants you to live he’ll heal you. But this was different, it was about the law. The congregation believed that God’s law was above human law. That we didn’t go to the police but we consulted with God.

They spoke in quiet whispers, and I could still hear the occasional sob, but I decided it wasn’t my business, and I went into the bathroom. 
	
The service went on like usual. I had to admit, my parents were great musicians, worship was always my favorite part of the service. The singing ended, the kids got dismissed to kid’s class, but I asked my parents if I could stay with the grown ups, as they had just made their way off the stage.

“I’m too old for kids' class mom.”

“Oh come on Andy, Trevor still goes, and he’s almost a year older than you are.” 

“Please mom, I’m not a little kid anymore.”

My dad chimed in, “If we let you stay you’re not allowed to complain alright bud?”

“Kay dad.” I excitedly sat down.

After a few minutes I regretted staying for the service. The different church elders got up to talk about announcements and plans for the future, the boredom, I’m sure, was radiating off of me. I wanted to stay for the sermon, to be a big kid, but I couldn’t deny that I wished I had just gone down and watched veggie-tales with Josh.

But when Pastor Matthew took the stage, he said something that even as a kid caught my attention.

“I know we are all worried, but we still haven’t found anything out about George Crowley, please keep him and his parents in your prayers. But most of all, remember to trust in God. The spirit moves in mysterious ways, and though it is natural to worry, remember God’s plan is perfect, we need only trust in him. Just as he guards us and protects us from evil, he is holding George right now. And that’s what I want to talk about today. God’s plan. We as humans struggle with the realities of our world, we see sin everywhere, and it is easy to worry about the physical and the tangible. But God isn’t concerned with the physical…” The pastor continued but I stopped listening.

I wondered about what he said, was it true that all we had to do was believe. That George would be fine as long as we trusted God. Even as young as I was, it didn’t feel right, maybe God wanted us to do something. All I knew was that I felt guilty, I felt that we were doing something wrong by waiting, and hoping.

I didn’t listen to any of the sermon really, I just kept thinking about George. Me and Josh had played with George many times. We had run around at the park, or even out in the grass after church. And now he was just gone. 

It was hard for me to process the idea of someone being gone. Sure I knew what death was, my grandma had died when I was nine. But George wasn’t dead, right? He was just gone. Or maybe he was dead. Those thoughts made me feel sick and I remember I felt ill after the service was over.

The end of the service was interesting though. 

Pastor Matthew was talking about God’s power, the power he had over life and death, over sickness and health. I’m not sure how that pertained to the start of the sermon but again, I wasn’t exactly listening.

But Pastor Matthew began to walk through the crowd. He walked up to Mr. Jones, he was an older man in a wheelchair, my parents had told me that he never learned to walk like other kids, that there was something hurt in his legs, and he had been wheelchair bound his whole life. That’s the way they explained it to me as a child at least. 

Pastor Matthew was speaking more intensely now, about how powerful God was and about how we were never to question God about what his plan was.

“Who are we to question the creator, does not a creator hold knowledge that creation does not.” He laid his hands on Mr. Jones’ shoulders, “How can the imperfect question the perfect. How can the finite hope to understand the infinite.” Mr. Jones had a very strange expression on his face. 

“We are brush strokes of a masterpiece. But the masterpiece is not ours to see!” His voice was beginning to scare me, “Why must your faith falter? Does not God love our children more than we can ever comprehend! Do not allow tragedy to drive you from God. Find God in the tragedy. It is written in Deuteronomy ‘Thou shall not put the Lord your God to the test!’ Does he not show his power to us!”

The pastor turned to Mr. Jones, “Get up and walk my friend.” and then he did. Mr. Jones who had been crippled his entire life stood up out of his wheelchair with tears in his eyes. He then knelt on one knee and clasped his hands above his head.

“Praise God!” He shouted.

Everyone was starstruck, the cheers were deafening, and Pastor Matthew smiled as people gathered around him wide-eyed laying hands on him and screaming praises to God.

I don’t know why, but I still felt sick. My parents cheered and praised, but I had gotten more nauseous. I felt like there was something very wrong here. But I felt guilty for that thought. A man could now walk, I should feel happy. But I didn’t.

The celebration continued for a long while. It continued while me and my parents left the Sanctuary and headed to the kid’s class. 

I was curious as we walked down the stairs and I asked my parents, who were still starstruck. 

“Has anything like that ever happened before, I mean, I know there are miracles in the Bible, but has Pastor Matthew ever done something like that before.”

My father who was still smiling answered me, “It’s been a long time, but yes, several months ago he prayed over Don Mayes, you remember how he was very sick.”

“Yes I remember.”

“Well in truth son, Don had cancer, and he was going to die, but God healed him.”

I was shocked but the sick feeling never left me.

We finally made it to the kids class, and my parents asked the teacher to get Josh. 

The teacher left the doorway, and began asking some of the kids, as she walked around looking.

I felt like I was going to throw up, but I didn’t know why.

“Mrs. Sanders,” My mother spoke after a few moments, “We really need to get going, where’s Josh?” 

The young woman looked up, with a worried look in her eye.

“I don’t know.”
