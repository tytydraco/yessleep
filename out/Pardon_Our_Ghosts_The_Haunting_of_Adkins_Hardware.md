Part One: 

At 3:15 a.m. on December 18th, 2024, fire companies from Burleigh, Bishopville, and nearby Whaleyville responded to an uncontrolled blaze at 324 N. Jefferson. By the time they arrived, the sky lit up in a harsh orange and black smoke stretched all the way to the beaches of Ocean City. The five buildings that made up Adkins Hardware had burned to their footings.

All I could do was count my blessings.

Two years earlier, I had joined fifteen others for the two-hour ghost walk of Burleigh, Maryland. Unlike the Lewes Ferry, where whale sightings are almost guaranteed, Chesapeake Ghost Tours promised only history lessons told with flair and, if you were lucky, a blurry orb on your iPhone.

Someone captured a smear of light on their screen near the abandoned railroad tracks. One heckler wasn’t buying it. “It’s a white blob,” he sneered. “I’ve seen clearer pictures of Bigfoot.” Tabtha, our guide, lost her patience, and, I would later learn , her job. After a hasty call to her boss, we all signed waivers, handed EMF meters, and rerouted to a stop she had repeatesdly been warned to steer clear of.

What happened next is harder to pin down. From memory, the heckler was shoved against the loading dock wall, lifted, and dropped. I can still hear the thud, though sometimes I wonder if he just tripped and my mind filled in the gaps. Tabtha managed to distract us with a For Sale sign in the window, complete with a name and phone number. She even encouraged us to call and make an offer.

After twenty years of teaching high school and an early retirement, I thought: why not revive Adkins Mercantile? I figured whatever convinced Old Man Mortimer Adkins to drive his Buick through the plate-glass entrance of the Salisbury Walmart twenty-five years ago was long gone. At least, that’s what I told myself.

I started with Chrissy Tingle, a prominent real estate agent whose billboards claim she’d been Ocean City’s top realtor since the discovery of saltwater taffy. During our meeting, she handed me a 1991 case study: *Stambovsky v. Ackley*, now popularly dubbed the Ghostbuster Ruling, and a Redfin article on ‘Stigmatized Properties.’ Then she warned, “The ghost tour owner used the word *poltergeist*…three times.”

“Poltergeist is just German for ghost,” I said, shrugging her off. “Everything in German sounds harsher than it really is. We say ‘hot-air balloon,’ they say ‘Hindenburg.’” When she persisted, I did what anyone else does when faced with a personal problem: I asked my phone. “Hey Siri, what’s a poltergeist?”

A British voice replied, “I found this on the web: A poltergeist is a type of ghost or spirit responsible for physical disturbances, such as loud noises and the movement or destruction of objects, often resulting in bodily harm and/or death. They are considered the apex predators of the paranormal kingdom. Would you like to know more?”

“Fuck me,” I muttered, shoving the phone away. “Sounds like the warning label on my aspirin bottle.”

As a former teacher I I decided to do some homework and research local hauntings. I visited a nearby Victorian-Era hotel, once notorious for ripped bodices and local conspiracies, and now better known for its unseen guests than paying ones. There, longtime manager Angie Delacroix shared her twenty-plus years working alongside wayward spirits: Bars of soap vanishing from housekeeping carts, employees quitting mid-shift, and her personal favorite, the Emily Post Suite. I loved her description so much I remembered writing it down on a scrap of paper: *"Her name screams refinement, etiquette, and thank-you notes. But the ghosts in her room show zero social graces."*

As if that weren't enough, Angie added sightings of a little girl, often seen playing jacks alone in the shadows. Two years later, she appeared in the hardware store, but I’m getting ahead of myself, as my ADHD tends to do. She was one of the “good” ghosts. Never causing trouble, unless you counted the occasional tripping over scattered jacks.

On April 2, 2022, my offer was accepted. Like most hauntings, it began with small annoyances: strange noises, tools missing, a shopping cart rolling on its own. Over the summer, I interviewed more than forty potential employees and oversaw nearly a dozen contractors. Several quit early, citing only “unseen circumstances.”

The only real incident, if you want to call it that, involved a shop-vac. The construction company called it a fuck-up. Paramedics called it an accident. I was in my office finalizing an order of pressure-treated lumber when the commotion broke out down the hallway. A maintenance worker was just cleaning up loose construction debris. Later, he told police the hose twitched, then coiled around his neck. The ridges bit into his skin then the nozzle climbed toward his right eye. He clawed at it until the sharp pop came. His eyeball was sucked into the hosel. It was later retrieved mixed in with nails, drywall dust, small chunks of building materials and a few child’s jacks.

Before I could decide if it was paranormal, the manufacturer, headquartered in Terre Haute, Indiana, emailed a recall notice, warning that Vortex-equipped DustMaster3000s were unstable. But when I visited Pete in the hospital, he shook his head. He couldn’t prove it, but he knew what he felt. He’d handled every kind of tool imaginable, quirks and all. “This wasn’t that,” he said. “This one had intent. Like it had been waiting. Like it *wanted* to blind me.”

The rest of this story is cobbled from police reports, scraps of paper, staff interviews, Pardon Our Ghost customer comment cards, and from Mallory Daniels, my assistant manager and whom I would soon fall in love with and marry. I still remember how calm she was that night when we came toe to toe with a particularly hostile poltergeist. She glanced at me, smiled, then turned back and asked, “When was the last time you flossed?”

That’s the background. Next I’ll share details of what happens after the ribbon cutting. That's when the real trouble begins.
