Nearly as long as I've worked in private industry, perhaps 25 years, I've also been adjunct faculty at the local state college. The pay is embarrassing, especially when calculated at an hourly rate, but the rewards are deeper. I love my subject, I love designing classes, and I love my studentsâ€”especially the ones who struggle, because it's in them I've often seen the greatest potential and they've been a wonderful investment of my time and efforts. 

Very recently, a lot of people have been complaining about the new crop of students, but I've been around long enough to know that's an unchanging part of human existence. I'm sure Adam and Eve complained about Cain and Abel being lazy and aimless and unmotivated when they were in whatever Old Testament version of elementary school might have existed in the minds of Christians. 

But something is a bit different. It's not the gangs of the 90s. It's not the selfishness of the 80s. It's not the disco vs. metal nonsense of the late 70s. It's something else. 

For a growing number of students, there appear to be no coping mechanisms whatsoever for even the most mundane challenges, reading comprehension has dropped off a cliff, and cheating is beyond rampant. Most never even read my lecture slides and exam study guides online. But there are deeper problems. Few of my students ask why about anything anymore. They show up, maybe kinda take notes, and the ones who turn in papers are writing at maybe a third grade level even though they're in upper division writing courses in college. I spoke directly to a student this morning who lost focus by my second sentence. 

I've spoken both to my colleagues in higher ed and in K-12, and theories abound. We moved away from phonics, so they can't read. We stopped assigning reading entire books. Teachers no longer have agency in creating curriculum. We've moved to a local consumer model of education. No Child Left Behind and teaching to the test. A complete lack of discipline for inappropriate or even dangerous behaviors... And that's without getting into entitled parents or the biggest boogeyman of all, cell phones and social media. It's amazing how many experts on human attention there are all of a sudden. 

So I changed my teaching. I switched to shorter bursts of information, more novel approaches, and I started using K-12 classroom management strategies like seating charts and walking around my classes as I lectured or engaged in conversation. These were moderately successful at most. There was a distinct lack of drive, grit, focus, and even mental presence. 

One of my colleagues engaged in research for a proposed journal article hoping that he could point a finger at the pandemic, but the data that came back indicated that, actually, the problem came before that. Another tried to tie this growing problem to the advent of social media and smartphones, essentially addiction to digital services, but that ended up not being anywhere near conclusive. 

I kept experimenting in my own classroom, but regardless of what I did, it was getting worse. I was getting genuinely concerned about gen alpha and gen z. 

Then I noticed something. 

I'd been a morning runner, three times a week, since high school. Damn, thirty years now. It took some grit initially, but that was decades ago and by now it was a habit as ingrained as breathing. Alarm goes off, drink water, make bed, blow nose, lace up stretch, go. One morning, though, I just didn't have it and I hit snooze. Then again. Then again. I'd never hit snooze before. I ended up going on a run, but it took a surprising amount of focus and drive. Within four weeks, I no longer had it in me. I was still in great shape, had mitochondria for days, but I just couldn't get myself to do it. 

And the morning paper, jesus christ. Time was, I'd get through about half the Washington Post with my coffee before heading out. Current events, politics, sports; they all were novel and I felt connected to the world and informed to start the day. Now? Everything was skimming. I tried to force myself to read the story above the fold, which was about the recent trend globally of far-right and fascists being elected in ostensibly democratic countries. I made it about a paragraph in before catching myself skimming. By lunch, I'd retained nothing. 

And I felt exhausted. How?! I was missing a 1000 calorie-burning run several times a week!!! I should have been bursting with energy like a middle schooler after their first ever coffee. By 2:00, I felt like I needed a nap. Indulging that impulse one day was a terrible mistake, because before long I could sleep eight hours a night and then take a four hour nap in the afternoon. 

Grading was a slog, work was a slog... everything just became too difficult and too... beige? I dunno. 

It wasn't phonetics or No Child Left Behind or a lack of discipline. It wasn't gentle parents or helicopter parents, I got my ass beat as a kid and had outstanding discipline entering adulthood (and a few years of therapy to deal with the physical and emotional abuse). It wasn't even smartphones and social media, I barely ever used them. I read a physical newspaper... or, at least, I used to. I've not read the Washington Post since they were shut down by the administration. 

I kinda just go through the motions as best I can now. I sometimes show up to school or work, but I mostly just lay in bed. Most of the food delivery services are overtaxed and they can't find enough people to work. There were some protests, marches, but nothing much now. Sounds exhausting. One of the last published articles from the New England Journal of Medicine was something about an environmental factor that was fundamentally affecting all people or something, but I can't really remember. I'd only skimmed it. Microplastics? Pharmaceuticals? 

had four students this morning, lectured a bit off my old slides. president said we're... um... invading mexico or something? get 'em back for taking jobs or w/ever.fell asleep during the news broadcast
