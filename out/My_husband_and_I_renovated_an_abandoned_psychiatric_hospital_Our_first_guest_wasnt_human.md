I never should have listened to Jack. "It'll be an adventure," he said. "We'll make it beautiful," he promised. Now I'm trapped in this nightmare, and I don't know if I'll ever escape. But I need to write this down, to warn others. Please, whatever you do, stay far away from the Old Willowbrook Hotel.

It all started six months ago. Jack and I had been married for just over a year, and we were looking for a project to tackle together. Something that would challenge us, but also bring us closer. That's when we stumbled upon the listing for the abandoned Willowbrook Psychiatric Hospital.

The realtor's photos showed a hulking Victorian-style building, all faded red brick and crumbling white trim. Vines crawled up the walls, nature slowly reclaiming what man had left behind. It was exactly the kind of fixer-upper Jack had always dreamed of.

"Can you imagine it, Liv?" he'd said, blue eyes sparkling with excitement. "We could turn it into a boutique hotel. Something really unique."

I'd been hesitant at first. The place gave me the creeps, even in pictures. But Jack's enthusiasm was infectious, and soon I found myself caught up in his vision. We could restore the grand staircase, update the rooms with modern amenities while keeping the vintage charm. Maybe even play up the spooky history angle for Halloween.

So we took the plunge. We emptied our savings account, took out a massive loan, and became the proud (and terrified) owners of a dilapidated former psych ward.

The first few months were a whirlwind of demolition and reconstruction. We lived in a tiny RV parked outside, spending every waking hour working on the hotel. It was exhausting, but exhilarating. Jack and I made a great team, and I started to believe we might actually pull this crazy scheme off.

But then the dreams started.

It began with vague feelings of unease. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, heart racing, unable to remember why. Then the nightmares became more vivid. Shadowy figures lurking in corners. Screams echoing down long, dark hallways. And always, always, the sensation of being watched.

I tried to shake it off. Stress and lack of sleep, I told myself. It didn't help that we kept finding weird things as we worked. A child's drawing, tucked behind a baseboard, showing stick figures with hollow eyes. Scratch marks on the inside of a closet door. Once, I could have sworn I heard humming coming from an empty room.

Jack brushed off my concerns. "It's an old building, babe," he'd say. "Of course it's got some quirks. But think how awesome it'll be when we're done!"

I wanted to believe him. I really did. But as the weeks went on, the feeling of wrongness only grew stronger.

The day we finished the last guest room, I found Jack in the lobby, grinning from ear to ear. "We did it, Liv!" he exclaimed, pulling me into a bear hug. "We're ready to open!"

I forced a smile, trying to ignore the chill that ran down my spine. "Are you sure we're ready?" I asked. "Maybe we should wait a bit, do some test runs with friends or family first?"

Jack shook his head. "No way. We've got bills to pay. Besides, I already booked our first guest. He's arriving tomorrow!"

My stomach dropped. "Tomorrow? Jack, that's too soon. We haven't even-"

He cut me off with a kiss. "It'll be fine, babe. Trust me."

I wish I hadn't.

The next evening, just as the sun was setting, a sleek black car pulled up the long, winding driveway. Jack and I stood on the front steps, trying to look welcoming despite my nerves.

A tall man in an expensive-looking suit stepped out of the car. He had silver hair and piercing grey eyes that seemed to look right through me.

"Welcome to the Old Willowbrook Hotel," Jack said, extending his hand. "I'm Jack, and this is my wife, Olivia."

The man's thin lips curved into a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Charmed," he said, his voice smooth as silk. "You can call me... Mr. Smith."

As I shook his hand, a jolt of *something* passed between us. His skin was ice-cold, and for a split second, I could have sworn his eyes flashed completely black.

"Is everything alright, Mrs...?" Mr. Smith asked, tilting his head.

I blinked, and his eyes were normal again. Just grey. Nothing unusual. I must have imagined it.

"Sorry," I mumbled. "It's been a long day. Let me show you to your room."

As we walked through the lobby, Mr. Smith's eyes darted around, taking in every detail. "Fascinating place," he murmured. "So much... history in these walls."

I led him up the grand staircase, acutely aware of his presence behind me. We'd put him in Room 217, at the end of the hall. As I fumbled with the key, I noticed his gaze fixed on a spot just above the door frame.

"Is there a problem?" I asked.

He smiled that cold smile again. "Not at all. I was just admiring your... protection."

I frowned, following his gaze. There was nothing there but peeling paint.

Before I could ask what he meant, Jack appeared, lugging Mr. Smith's suitcase. "Here you go, sir! Liv, why don't you head down and get dinner started? I'll finish getting Mr. Smith settled."

I nodded, grateful for the excuse to escape. As I hurried down the stairs, I heard Mr. Smith's voice drift after me:

"I think I'm going to enjoy my stay here *very* much."

A shudder ran through me. What had we gotten ourselves into?

That night, I tossed and turned, unable to shake the feeling of dread that had settled over me. Every creak of the old building set my nerves on edge.

Just as I was finally drifting off, a blood-curdling scream jolted me awake.

I bolted upright, heart pounding. "Jack! Did you hear that?"

My husband stirred beside me, rubbing his eyes. "Hear what, babe?"

"That scream! Someone was-"

Another shriek pierced the air, closer this time. Jack sat up, suddenly alert. "What the hell?"

We scrambled out of bed, throwing on robes as we rushed into the hallway. The scream had come from the direction of Room 217 - Mr. Smith's room.

Jack reached the door first, pounding on it. "Mr. Smith? Are you alright?"

No answer.

I tried the handle. Locked.

"I'm going to open it," Jack said, fumbling with the master key.

Part of me wanted to tell him to stop, to just call the police and let them handle it. But I knew we couldn't do that. Not when our first and only guest might be in trouble.

The lock clicked, and Jack pushed the door open.

The room was dark, lit only by moonlight filtering through the curtains. At first glance, everything seemed normal. The bed was pristine, looking like it hadn't been slept in at all.

"Mr. Smith?" I called out softly.

A low chuckle came from the corner of the room. We both whirled around to see Mr. Smith sitting in an armchair, perfectly composed in his suit despite the late hour.

"Is everything okay?" Jack asked. "We heard screaming."

Mr. Smith's lips curved into that unsettling smile. "Did you? How odd. I've been sitting here quite peacefully all night."

I frowned. "But we both heard-"

"Perhaps," Mr. Smith interrupted, "it was simply the wind. These old buildings do make such fascinating noises, don't they?"

Something in his tone made my skin crawl. I tugged on Jack's arm. "We're sorry to have disturbed you, Mr. Smith. Have a good night."

As we turned to leave, Mr. Smith spoke again. "Oh, Mrs. Campbell? You might want to check on Room 113. I believe there may be a... issue there."

I froze. We hadn't told him our last name. And Room 113 was still under renovation - we hadn't even mentioned its existence to him.

Back in our room, I turned to Jack. "That was weird, right? Tell me that wasn't just me."

He ran a hand through his hair. "Yeah, it was... off. But maybe he just overheard our name somewhere? And he could have seen the room numbers when we showed him around."

I shook my head. "Jack, something's not right here. We need to-"

A loud thud from downstairs cut me off.

"It came from the direction of Room 113," Jack said, his face pale.

We crept down the stairs, the old wood creaking beneath our feet. The closer we got to Room 113, the colder the air became. By the time we reached the door, I could see my breath misting in front of me.

Jack reached for the handle, but I grabbed his wrist. "Wait," I whispered. "Listen."

From behind the door came a soft sound. Like... crying? No, not crying. Whimpering. The sound of someone in pain.

"Hello?" Jack called out. "Is someone in there?"

The whimpering stopped abruptly. For a moment, there was only silence.

Then, a voice - high and childlike - spoke:

"Help me. She won't let me out."

Jack and I exchanged horrified glances. There shouldn't be anyone in that room, let alone a child.

"We're coming in," Jack said, turning the handle.

The door swung open with a creak, revealing... nothing. The room was empty, dusty furniture covered in dropcloths. No sign of a child, or anyone else.

"What the fuck is going on?" Jack muttered.

I was about to respond when something caught my eye. On the far wall, illuminated by a shaft of moonlight, was a series of scratch marks. As I moved closer, I realized they formed words:

"DON'T LET HIM STAY"

My blood ran cold. "Jack," I whispered. "We need to get out of here. Now."

He nodded, face ashen. "Yeah. Yeah, okay. Let's just grab some clothes and-"

A scream from upstairs cut him off. But this time, it wasn't the otherworldly shriek from before.

It was Mr. Smith.

We raced back upstairs, all thoughts of leaving forgotten. The door to Room 217 was wide open now, and the sounds coming from inside made my stomach churn. Wet, ripping noises. Like something being torn apart.

"Mr. Smith?" Jack called out as we approached the doorway.

The noises stopped.

We peered into the room, and I had to clap a hand over my mouth to stifle a scream.

Mr. Smith stood in the center of the room, his back to us. But it wasn't Mr. Smith anymore. His suit was in tatters, revealing grey, mottled skin underneath. And his head... oh God, his head was twisted completely backward, grey eyes staring at us over his own shoulder.

He smiled, revealing rows of needle-sharp teeth.

"I'm so glad you could join us," the thing that used to be Mr. Smith said. "The others have been waiting for so long."

As if on cue, shadows began to peel themselves from the walls. Dozens of them, vaguely human-shaped, with glowing eyes and grasping hands.

"You see," Not-Mr.-Smith continued, his head slowly rotating to face forward again with a sickening series of cracks, "when you reopened this place, you let us all back in. And now, we're never letting you leave."

The shadows surged forward. Jack grabbed my hand, yanking me back into the hallway. "Run!" he shouted.

We fled down the corridor, the sound of inhuman laughter echoing behind us. But as we reached the top of the stairs, I realized with horror that more shadows were streaming up from the lobby, cutting off our escape.

We were trapped.

Jack and I stood frozen at the top of the stairs, shadows closing in from both sides. The thing that used to be Mr. Smith approached slowly, savoring our fear.

"What do you want?" I managed to choke out.

It tilted its head, an unsettling imitation of curiosity. "Want? My dear, we simply want what was promised to us. What was stolen from us so long ago."

Jack's grip on my hand tightened. "We don't understand," he said, voice shaking. "We just bought this place to renovate it. We didn't steal anything."

The creature laughed, a sound like bones grinding together. "Oh, but you did. You stole our home. Our... hunting grounds."

As it spoke, the shadows drew closer. I could feel their cold touch on my skin, hear their whispers in my ears. Fragments of memories not my own flashed through my mind - straight jackets, padded cells, screams echoing down endless corridors.

"This was never just a hospital," I realized aloud. "It was a prison. For them."

Not-Mr.-Smith's grin widened impossibly. "Very good. You see, the doctors here... they knew what we were. What we could do. They tried to contain us, to study us. But we were too strong. Too hungry."

Jack shook his head. "That's impossible. Willowbrook closed down over 50 years ago. You can't be-"

"Time means nothing to us," the creature snarled. "We waited. We grew stronger. And now, thanks to you two, we're free again."

The shadows surged forward, and I knew we had only seconds left. In desperation, I grabbed the nearest object - a heavy brass lamp from a side table - and swung it at Not-Mr.-Smith's head.

To my shock, it connected with a sickening crunch. The creature howled, more in rage than pain, and the shadows recoiled momentarily.

"The attic!" I shouted to Jack. "There's another staircase in the old servants' quarters!"

We bolted down the hallway, the sounds of pursuit close behind. I led Jack to a hidden door I'd discovered during renovations, praying it would still open.

It did, revealing a narrow staircase. We raced up, slamming the door behind us. Jack wedged a broken chair under the handle, but we both knew it wouldn't hold for long.

The attic was a maze of old furniture and forgotten relics. Dust swirled in the air, making it hard to breathe. We navigated by moonlight streaming through a single circular window.

"There!" Jack pointed to a hatch in the ceiling. "It must lead to the roof."

As he reached for it, a cold hand wrapped around my ankle. I screamed, kicking out at the shadow that had somehow slipped through the floorboards.

Jack whirled around, grabbing a rusty fire poker. He swung it through the shadow, which dissipated with an unearthly shriek.

More shadows were seeping in now, and the door at the bottom of the stairs splintered with a thunderous crack.

"Go!" I yelled at Jack. "Open the hatch!"

He hesitated for a split second, then nodded. As he struggled with the rusted latch, I fended off the encroaching darkness with wild swings of the fire poker.

Finally, the hatch creaked open. Jack pulled himself up, then reached back to help me.

Just as my fingers brushed his, something wrapped around my waist, yanking me backward. I screamed, clawing at the attic floor.

Not-Mr.-Smith's distorted face loomed over me, jaws unhinged to reveal that maw full of needle teeth. "You're not going anywhere," it hissed.

Jack lunged forward, grabbing my arms. For a moment, I was suspended between two forces - Jack pulling me towards safety, and the creature dragging me back into darkness.

"Let her go!" Jack shouted, straining with effort.

The creature's only response was a bone-chilling laugh.

I could feel my grip on Jack's hands slipping. The shadows were creeping up my body, their touch burning like ice. In that moment, I knew with terrifying certainty that if I let go, I would be lost forever.

"Jack," I gasped out. "Whatever happens, don't let go. Please."

His eyes met mine, filled with determination and fear. "Never," he promised.

The shadows surged forward, enveloping us both. I couldn't see, couldn't breathe. All I knew was the feeling of Jack's hands in mine as we were pulled in opposite directions.

Something had to give.

And then, with a deafening roar that shook the entire building, it did.

The roar grew louder, drowning out even the inhuman shrieks of the shadows. Suddenly, I felt a rush of cool air. Jack gave one final, desperate tug, and I flew upward, out of the grasping darkness and onto the roof.

We scrambled away from the open hatch, gasping for breath. Below us, the creature that was once Mr. Smith howled in fury.

But something else was happening. The entire building had begun to shake violently. Cracks spider-webbed across the roof beneath our feet, and a deep groaning sound came from within the walls.

"The foundation," Jack yelled over the noise. "When we renovated, we must have weakened it somehow!"

I watched in horrified awe as the grand old building began to collapse in on itself. The shadows writhed and twisted, trying to escape, but they seemed bound to the structure. Their screams mingled with the sound of shattering glass and splintering wood.

Jack pulled me to the edge of the roof. "We have to jump!"

I looked down at the ground, dizzyingly far below. "We'll never survive that fall!"

"We don't have a choice!"

He was right. The roof was crumbling beneath us. It was jump or be dragged down with the hotel and its monstrous inhabitants.

Hand in hand, we leaped.

I'd like to say I remembered some profound thought as we fell, or that my life flashed before my eyes. But honestly, all I remember is screaming.

We hit something softer than the ground - the awning over the front entrance, I realized later. It slowed our fall just enough. We bounced off and landed hard on the gravel driveway.

Everything hurt, but we were alive.

We crawled away from the collapsing building, turning to watch as the Old Willowbrook Hotel - our dream, our nightmare - imploded in a cloud of dust and unearthly wails.

As the dust settled, an eerie silence fell. No more screams. No more shadows. Just the faint wail of sirens in the distance.

Jack pulled me close, his body shaking with sobs of relief. I clung to him, hardly daring to believe we'd survived.

That was three months ago.

The official story is that we accidentally triggered a sinkhole during renovations. There were a lot of questions, of course. About Mr. Smith (whose rental car was found abandoned miles away), about why we were on the roof, about the screams neighbors reported hearing.

But in the end, there was no evidence of anything supernatural. Just two lucky idiots who nearly died when their poorly-planned renovation went horribly wrong.

Jack and I don't talk about what really happened that night. Not to the police, not to our families, not even to each other. It's easier to pretend it was all a stress-induced hallucination. That we imagined the shadows, the creature, the centuries-old evil we accidentally unleashed.

But I know the truth. I see it in the way Jack flinches at unexpected shadows. I feel it in the nightmares that jolt me awake, heart racing, certain I can hear whispering in the walls.

We've moved since then, to a bright, modern apartment with no history and no dark corners for monsters to hide. But sometimes, when I close my eyes, I'm back in that hotel. I feel the shadows creeping over my skin. I hear that bone-chilling laugh.

And I wonder... did we really escape? Or did we just bring a piece of that darkness home with us?

I'm writing this now as a warning. To anyone thinking of buying an old building with a dark past. To urban explorers seeking thrills in abandoned places. To anyone who thinks that evil is just a concept, not a tangible force.

Be careful. Be cautious. Because sometimes, the monsters are real. And once you've seen them, you can never truly unsee them.

As for Jack and me? We're done with renovation projects. These days, we're just focusing on rebuilding our life, one day at a time. And hoping that the shadows we glimpse out of the corner of our eyes are just that - shadows, and nothing more.

But deep down, I know better. And I sleep with the lights on, just in case.
