My father was my hero. As Police Chief for nearly 12 years, he caught numerous criminals and oversaw major cases. Now, he's been dead for almost two weeks. Brain cancer took him quickly, lasting barely four months from diagnosis. It was a devastating blow to everyone who knew him.

It took me a while to gather the strength to visit his house and start organizing and cleaning his belongings. Too many memories haunted that place. After splitting with my mom when I was young, he lived in a small townhouse less than two miles from the police station. Walking into the house felt surreal. A huge puzzle piece was missing, and he wasn't coming back.

I began in the attic, and to my surprise, found numerous boxes labeled with case numbers. As I went through them, it became clear these were cold cases he had worked on over the years—missing persons and unsolved murders. I stayed up there, rifling through each box, wondering why he never returned them to the precinct. Some of this stuff looked really important.

Then, I found the tapes. The box had no case numbers on it, just a collection of small video tapes and an old video camera. All the tapes were dated. To my amazement, the camera still had a bit of charge. I loaded one of the tapes. It was a video of a girl, not much older than me, tied to a chair and gagged.

A slightly muffled voice I couldn’t recognize spoke from behind the camera. “I’m going to remove your gag. There is no point in screaming. No one can hear you.” A man wearing a latex mask and industrial goggles approached her. He removed her gag, and she began to plead for her release.

He told her he was going to kill her, but he would give her a choice. “Fast or slow?” he asked as she began to hyperventilate. “If you choose fast, I’ll simply shoot you in the head. You won’t feel a thing, but I promise they’ll never find your body.” She screamed for help, but he muffled her with his gloved hand. “Or, I can kill you slowly. Here’s the thing. If you let me kill you slowly, I’ll take off my mask for this little video. Makes it much easier to catch me, no?”

He removed his hand. She whimpered. “I’ll ask one more time: fast or slow?” he demanded. She closed her eyes and whispered something I couldn’t make out. He yelled for her to speak up. She screamed “fast!” Immediately, he pulled out a pistol and shot her in the head. Blood sprayed onto the plastic sheeting covering the room.

That was the end of the first tape. To my horror, every tape I watched afterward was the same—different women, bound and given the same choice. Be killed quickly and painlessly, or slowly and painfully. He always offered to remove his mask if they chose the latter. There must have been at least three dozen tapes in the box.

I found the most recent tape. It was dated almost a year ago. The video started the same way, but this woman wasn't screaming. She stared into the camera with a look of hatred. The voice gave her the same choice. She chuckled and said “Slow.”

The man's voice became excited. “Are you sure? Do you really mean it?” She continued staring into the camera. “Take off your damn mask and just get on with it,” she said sternly. He stood in front of her for what felt like ages before finally grabbing a handsaw from a nearby table. He pulled off his mask and then grabbed a handful of her hair, yanking her head back and thanking her. 

I don't know what was more horrifying—the ghastly sounds of her being slowly decapitated, or the gleeful look in my father's eyes as he did it.
