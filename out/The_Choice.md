I slowly open my eyes, waking from sleep. I hear it again. That strange yet alluring melody outside my bedroom window. The same melody that I’ve been hearing for the past eight years since my family inherited this cottage by Lake Lira. And again, I feel drawn to this song from the lake. Not really drawn but pulled. As if some puppeteer behind an unseen veil is controlling my body to rise from my bed with invisible strings. Slowly shuffling one foot after another, I leave my bedroom and begin my way to the front door of the cottage. 

I pass my parents’ bedroom door, but I don’t attempt to scream or warn them of this calling. I’ve taken this journey before, and I am at peace with it. Every summer we come this little cottage of ours and every summer, there are nights where I am beckoned to the lake. As I turn the doorknob to leave the cottage, I always have the same thought; maybe I’ll see her again. Maybe I’ll see the pale form that summons me whenever we visit this place. I open the front door and begin my trek to the dock.

It’s not a long walk. A minute after leaving the cottage, I am already at the end of the dock, and staring at the reflection of the moon in the water. It’s always so serene on nights like this. Sadly though, the quiet is broken with the gnawing memories of this serene view. I peer into the water and see faint hints of mottled white peeking from the lake bottom of sediment and silt. Why don’t people notice these when visiting the lake? I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone else visiting this lake besides us. Unless I was the one to bring them here. But why do I bring them here? I can’t remember. It’s as if there is some barrier in my mind that’s preventing me from remembering the friends or…strangers that I bring to show the beauty of this lake. Is my mind preventing me from remembering or is it protecting me? The only thing that I always remember is that melody. 

I hear a small disturbance in the water, and I push the feeling of guilt out of my head. Turning my head towards the sound, I see…her. My heart begins to race as she slowly glides through the water toward me only showing the top half of her head. I lower myself and sit at the end of the dock with my feet barely grazing the water. The melody gets louder as she approaches, and I’m startled by flashing memories of thrashing water and blood. As suddenly as the memories arrived, the song stops, and the silence brings me out of my vicious thoughts. She’s floating near my feet. 

My eyes soak in her pale beautiful form beneath the water, as she slowly treads in the water below me. She looks up at me through her long black hair that cascades over her face, not with inhuman eyes but eyes of warm gentle amber. Eyes that could command the most stubborn heart to perform whatever bidding those eyes demanded. Looking down at her, I smile as she lifts a small delicate hand out of the water and slowly wraps her long delicate fingers around my foot. She begins to gently tug my foot, almost playfully. She wants me in the water. She has never wanted me in the water, only…the others.

She tugs again, this time with a little more force, causing me to grab onto the side of the dock. Fear starts to creep in but is easily pushed aside when I see her beautiful face lift out of the water, showing a look of innocence. She releases her grip and floats a small distance away from the dock. Always keeping her eyes trained on me. She floats there as if she’s waiting for me to join her. But why? Then I notice I her song as stopped. She hasn’t sung since she approached me. The spell has been lifted and yet I am still here, gazing at this alluring creature. After my slight hesitation, I begin to lower myself slowly into the water. The lake is cold but not unbearable. I never break eye contact with her as I finish lowering the rest of my body into the lake. As the water reaches my shoulders, I notice a mild thrumming around me. A vibration in the water that is resonating from her. In an instant, I feel something grab onto my ankle and yanks me deep underwater.

I panic, trying to swim back up to the surface in the deep darkness but the grip around my ankle does not loosen. I reach down to my ankle to remove the strange hold and realize…its hair, its black hair wrapped around my ankle. I squint through the water trying to regain my bearing and I make out small shafts of moonlight piercing the surface of the lake. A strange darkness grows, beginning to surround me and I come to a stark realization that it’s not the black depths of the water that encircle me, its hair, her hair. Long black tendrils that begin to close out the moonlight. Her face appears in the middle of the dark mass of coils and slowly, she swims towards me.

I float there in awe of her beauty. Her slim, pale, naked form floats an arm’s length from me and all I want to do is bring her close. I want to embrace her and to make her mine. She reaches out to my face and brushes her fingers down my cheek. I shudder at her touch. I want her.

My lungs begin to burn for air, and I try to make my way to the surface again, but she places her hand on my shoulder and gently restrains me. I look at her in confusion and she answers my look with that bewitching tilt of her head. As if on cue or the parting of clouds, more moonlight begins to fill the depths, revealing the world around us and spotlighting my past deeds. We float above a graveyard. The mottled white shapes at the bottom of the lake are hundreds of discarded human bones that litter the lake floor. Remains of the people that I brought to this lake to satisfy her hunger. People that did not choose to be taken by the lake. To be taken by her. Her hair begins to tighten in closer around us and she glides closer to me. I feel her naked body press up against mine, our eyes never breaking contact. Her hair begins to tremble and thrum around us. The remains below begin to bellow and rise creating torrent of murky white bones, encircling us, and I catch a glimpse of a hand wearing a ring that looks like my mother’s wedding ring. Her hair slowly encompassing and encapsulating us in a writhing ball of darkness. What have I done? All these people… 

She inches her face closer to mine and I expect a final motion to end this curse I bear. This service to the lady of the lake. I flinch as she abruptly moves even closer to my face but her gentle hand rests on the back of my head and pulls me forward to her lips. We kiss, and all worry drains from my mind. All that remains in this dark world is just her and I. All that I am, does not matter. All that I have done does not matter. She wanted me to choose to be here, not like the others. To choose to join her in the lake. To choose to be with her. She pulls away gently and as the writhing void of hair swallows us, I am left with one final vision of her before the darkness takes us…her smile.
