I opened the door to the basement. Stairs stretched down into darkness, almost as if it descended to hell. Almost.

I felt on the wall at the top of the stairs until I found the light switch. Giving it a few flicks on and off, I realized it wasn’t working. 
“Great,” I thought. “Another conversation in the dark.”
Taking a deep breath, I began to walk down the stairs. I felt the rough wood through my socks. Every step put me closer and closer to the thing that occupied my basement. I stopped, questioning whether or not I should continue down. I heard the door close behind me, snapping me back into the moment. I turned around, no longer seeing the light at the top of the stairs.

I looked back ahead of me, swallowing my fear. I remembered my instructions. “Talk casually, but don’t sound too confident. He hates confidence.” I took another step, feeling the damp carpet now as it soaked through my socks.
“Hello?” I asked shyly. I mentally kicked myself for not pretending to be comfortable. 

He responded with a growl. I opened my mouth to repeat myself, but he interrupted me.
“What this time?” A low, raspy voice responded. 
I thought back to the rule. He hates confidence. 
“How are you?” This time I managed to keep the shakiness out of my voice.
“The same. Always the same.”

I was confused by his reply. He’s never even hinted towards any emotion at all, much less boredom. I thought back to my childhood. 
“Wanna play 20 questions?” I said, remembering that my favourite game back then was 20 questions.
“I’ll think of the subject first.” 
Surprised that he actually was interested, I began thinking of what it could be.
“Is it an animal?” I asked.
“No,” he said. “It’s the taste of your blood once I have the chance to rip your throat out.”

I heard movement in the darkness. The sound of rearranging the way you sit or changing your posture. The sound that you can only hear when there’s nothing else to drown it out. I started shaking. I let fear take over my body. Then the sound of footsteps coming towards me filled the basement. I couldn’t see anything. 

I knew I’d messed up. The fact that I would no longer be receiving payment was the last of my worries. More footsteps, getting louder, closer. Danger getting closer to me. I no longer cared about keeping him calm. I spun around and sprinted up the stairs, taking them two at a time. 

The footsteps behind me sped up. They were matching my pace and even going faster than it. My heart was beating, even faster than the speed that eminent death was coming towards me. I ran face first into the door. It swung open and I dived into the floor. Regaining my balance, I threw myself into the door, causing it to slam shut. I fumbled for the lock, only managing to slide the metal bar into place seconds before the sound of a large animal slamming into the door echoed across the house. 

I started walking backwards and tripped, falling down on the wood floor near the basement door. My breathing was heavy and fast. He kept banging on the basement door, over and over again until he gave up. I pulled out my phone and rang the number that filled my recent phone calls list. 
“I’m sorry, I couldn’t keep the fear out of my voice. It knows that we are small now, and it wants to kill me. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so so sorry.” I cried intro be phone once the other end picked up.
“What the hell?” The strong American accent on the other line answered. “You had one job! That was to make sure that he didn’t find out he was stronger than us! Now look, we need to convince someone else to take him even sooner than we originally planned to!”

I remembered back when I took the job. A weird, old man gave me the opportunity to have a large sum of money in return for a strange job. 
“I have a bit of a problem on my hands. He is scared of us, for now. He doesn’t know that he could easily kill us. You need to make sure he doesn’t know his strength until I manage to give him to someone else.” The man had said on the day he’d given me the job. “There’s just one thing. You need to talk to him for an hour each day or else he’ll get mad. And when he’s mad, we die. You hear me?” 
I hadn’t known that it was going to be as crazy as it was, but I needed the money. So, I took the job. That was when I was given the list of instructions. 
“1. Don’t let it hear your fear. He’s smart, he will know that fear means weakness.” The piece of paper had said. I had managed to do the job correctly for fifteen days. For fifteen hours in total, I had talked to whatever he was. 

He knew that he was strong, and he intended on using his strength against us. I snapped out of my trance.

“You still there?” The man said on the phone. 
I paused for a second, then answered.
“Yeah. For now.”
“Look, just make sure that he stays in there. I’ll arrange for someone else to get him. And don’t think you’re being paid for this!” 
Anger filled my mind. 
“Are you kidding me? You mean I spoke to that thing for fifteen days for nothing?!”
I heard the sternness in his tone when he said, “You knew what to do. Not my fault you couldn’t do it.”
The phone call ended. 

Now I’m sitting in a house with a creature I haven’t even seen before. A creature that hasn’t seen me before, but wants to kill me. 

Help.
