So, I sit here in fear of my life. That is kind of an awkward way to start my story. Maybe I should delete that and start again, but I am not sure how much time I have so we will just continue. My name is Keith. I am 23 years old. I am currently hiding in a large garage. Some may call it a barn, but it does not feel like one. That is probably due to how it was remodeled. This started less than 24 hours ago. Well, we have been doing this for the last year, but this time was different. I am not sure exactly what happened or how. I can only speculate.   
   
It is the beginning of summer and me and my friends just  graduated from college. Most of my friends, that is. I have two that decided to pursue vocational degrees and are already doing very well for themselves. It is true what they say, college is not for everyone, but what they don’t say is that you can have a very successful and high paying job if you put forth the effort and dedication. I just graduated with a degree in psychology. My friend Sam just graduated from business school. My other friend Kevin just graduated with a degree in law. My other friend, Steve, decided to learn about heating and cooling while Lyle became a plumber. I have never realized how important these types of jobs are and how they are easily overlooked until your bathroom is flooding or you’re freezing your ass off in the winter. The hours these two works are more than we go to school and study. They are always on call because nothing wants to break when it is convenient, they say.  
   
Since we graduated, we wanted to relax and not worry about what we are going to do next. More college has come across our minds, and we have also discussed taking some time off and working for a while to save up some money and pay some debt. To be more like Steve and Lyle. Able to support ourselves without having to rely on more debt or help from our family.   
   
Enough of the back story before I can no longer tell my story. Many weekends we go to my father’s home in the country. He spends a lot of time elsewhere, so this is a place where we can sit back and spend some time together outdoors. We grab some food and some beer, well maybe a lot of beer, but college has probably skewed our opinion what is a lot of beer. We gather enough firewood for two days and set up our furniture. As the fire starts, we make our food and then sit back and relax, often talking about things the others missed out on. None of us have the same classes or even after school jobs. Due to the hours Steve and Lyle work, we are rarely able to spend time with them. The fire usually burns for the whole time we are there and there has never been a problem. Well until..now you could say.  
   
This time was no different than any other time. As the sun began to set and the air began to cool, something must have happened. We all ate the same food and drank the same beer, so it couldn’t have been that. In my psychology class I learned about hypnosis and how it can affect your mind. Who could really believe that though. There were many examples of how it could happen. Swinging an object left to right while saying certain words was what was typically used and shown in the videos. It was also discussed that deep focus on a certain object could do the same. This is what has led me to believe that my friend was hypnotized. He was in a trance not focused on anything else. As if he was in his own entire world. Hypnotized by what though. I believe that I know how, but what would cause this. Was this brought on by itself or was there something completely different tonight. Did some kind of supernatural event occur? Was there something that happened on this day in the past? If I do not make it out of here someone needs to do the research so that it doesn't happen to someone else.   
   
Kevin has been really stressed about becoming a lawyer and knows that he has only started. He will have more school, only if he even gets accepted, and then will have to take a test to even become a lawyer. The test he talks about all the time is the bar exam. Apparently only 1 in 3 pass this test because of how gruesomely difficult it is. He met a few people that have taken the exam 4 times and still haven’t passed. He constantly wonders if that is going to be him. All that works for nothing. While we were hanging around the fire, Kevin seemed as if he began to space out a little and focus on the fire. No one thought anything of it because we all knew how he was feeling. Then it started to get a little weird. We realized that he was not paying attention to any of us or what was going on around him. He was leaning slightly forward, pressing his weight on to his knees to focus more on the fire. His focus was intense. So intense that Steve had to pull him back in fear that he was going to either fall into the pit or burn his face. He works with fire very often and knows how easy it is to get burned and how much that hurts. This happened 3 times throughout the evening.   
   
When Steve tried to pull him back, Kevin just rolled his shoulder to get away from his grip. At that point we kind of let him be., well that is until he got close again. We tried to continue with enjoying our time, but you could tell that in the back of our minds we were trying not to let him completely out of our view. Who knows what could happen to him in this state? By now it was late and completely dark except for the fire. All of us continued to drink, except for Kevin of course, and were no longer sober. As we got up to grab another beer or to relieve ourselves away from the fire, we moved a little slower to try not to fall. Matter of fact, the more that I think of it, Kevin never moved from his spot. I don’t even think he moved his gaze away from the fire. I know for damn sure he hasn’t said a single word since about 30 minutes after we sat down. Nothing else was really going on. We just sat next to the fire for a little while until we started discussing things that were going on in our lives.   
   
As it was my turn, Kevin finally stood up. He began to move around but something felt off. At first, I thought maybe it was because he was more sober than us because he stopped drinking as he stayed engaged with the fire, but it didn’t feel right. Even with how much I drank I could sense something in the air. As if it developed out of nowhere and suddenly that feeling began to increase. If it wasn’t for the fact that I was about to piss my pants unlike Lyle a few months ago, that will be a different story. I was tempted to stay where I was at. Maybe I was just feeling scared. I don’t know why I felt that way. There are no houses miles around us and the only nature that exists are deer and rabbits. So, we don’t have to fear something sneaking up on us and attacking.  
   
Unexpectedly Kevin just stood up. He began to walk up to the cooler, still not saying a word, and must have pulled out his pocketknife. I had my back turned as I walked towards the side of the barn. I could not say for sure exactly how that played out. Lyle was already there and asked him if he wanted a beer, but instead of saying anything, Kevin just reached behind him and slit his throat from front to back. This must have gone unnoticed for a minute because how else would one person be capable of doing that and a group of men without being stopped. He was able to walk up right behind Sam, who was kind of starting to fall asleep at this point and Kevin stabbed him in the neck. He fucking stabbed him in the neck. Did Lyle and Sam do something to him that we don’t know about? Even if they did would that be a reason to kill them in cold blood. That is when I heard Steve scream at the top of his lungs, “What the fuck did you just do? You just killed Sam. Lyle do you see this. Get over here. Shit did you kill Lyle also?’ The noise continued and I paused quickly, turning around. That is when I saw Sam. I realized I had my phone on me and pulled that out as I put my, you know, away. “Fuck, no service. How did I forget about that,” I said loudly.  
   
Steve grabbed a log that must have been sitting by one of the chairs and threatened to hit Kevin with it.  Kevin just stared at him and moved closer, slowly gliding his steps forward. This was something straight out of the movies. So smooth that it looked fake. As if he was strung to the ceiling of a stage and pulled across. No fear, no shakiness, no stuttering. Steve swung the log and hit Kevin right across the jaw. Kevin paused, pressed his hand where Steve had just hit him and made the biggest grin that a psychopath could make. That is, it. Kevin is acting like a psychopath right now. Steve prepared himself to swing again, but Kevin reached out a single hand and caught the log. Now he was gripping the end like one would do with a baseball bat. Steve tried his best to pull the log out of his grip, but it was of no use. That is when he dropped it and turned around. I shouted for him to come towards me, and so he began to run towards me. Maybe the two of this would have a chance to escape from Kevin or whatever is controlling him.   
   
Kevin appeared to still be smiling. He took the log that he was now holding in his hand and threw it at the ground. Wait what just happened. Steve just fell. I realized that Kevin must have thrown it at his feet, causing him to trip and land face first into the dirt. This must have stunned Steve badly because he was not getting back up. I began to run towards him, but Kevin was already on top of him at this point. How the fuck did he close that distance in a matter of seconds. He wasn’t even following him. Kevin was standing there and all of the sudden he was on top of Steve. I stopped fast in my tracks. Kevin noticed me. Putting his entire wait on top of Steve but paying no attention to what he was doing with him. His eyes were locked onto me. They were black with what appeared to be a dancing flame instead of pupils. This color contrast stood out and could be easily seen from where I was standing. This made a chill run down my spine. One of those chills that you must latterly shake off. While staring at me with that huge grin pasted to his face, he thrusted the knife into Steve’s side. Steve yelled out, ‘Run Keith, fuck, fuck those hurts, Run.” So, I feel like a bitch for what I have done during this night, but it felt of no use that I could have helped anyone. So, I ran, I ran into the barn. There was a set of wooden steps that led to a second floor, kind of similar to a loft. There were many boxes and equipment there that I thought I could hide here and find something to protect myself.   
   
I could hear more screaming from Steve, it was a high-pitched scream of terror. then suddenly it became silent. The silence that we are used to when were normally out here. Steve must be dead. That leaves just me. Me and Kevin. What the fuck am I going to do. I felt that it was more important that my story should be told rather than running. If I ran where would I go. Like I said there is nothing around us for miles. I wouldn’t be able to just jump in a car and drive off because I didn’t have the keys. I would have to go back out there and face Kevin to find them. The same Kevin that just murdered all my friends. If they were not able to stand a chance, then how would I be able to? I have no chance against Kevin. I am barely 150 pounds while he is 6 feet tall and a beast. The type that can’t go without lifting some weights for an entire day. So here I hide, typing on my phone, just hoping that the single will come back, so others will at least know what happened here.  
   
Please for the love of God, do not stare directly into the center of the fire for longer than a few seconds. It will grab a hold of your sole and never let it go. If you do not believe the story I have just told, maybe we will see a post here from your friends regarding your faith.
