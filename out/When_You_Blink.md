I noticed him on a Tuesday night. At first, I didn’t think much of it. I was sitting by the window, half-watching some late-night true crime show with the volume low, scrolling mindlessly through my phone. Outside, the street was mostly empty—the way it always is at that hour. Just a few parked cars, the occasional drunk stumbling home, and the distant whine of a siren that never seems to get closer.
Then I saw him.
Across the street. Just... standing there.
He wasn’t facing the building directly. More like he was angled slightly to the left, like someone about to step off the curb. But he wasn’t moving. Not even the subtle sway of someone waiting. Just locked in place. I squinted. Maybe thirty feet away, standing in a patch of shadow between two flickering lamps. Could’ve been a homeless guy. Or a loiterer. Or some weirdo. But the way he stood—it was too rigid. Too still. Like he was holding his breath.
I turned away for a second to grab my phone charger from the floor. When I looked back, he was closer.Not by a lot. But enough. Now he was near the fire hydrant on the corner. A few feet ahead of where he’d just been. I hadn’t seen him move. Hadn’t heard footsteps. But he had moved. I knew the sidewalk well enough to be sure. I stared hard. Didn't blink. The show in the background rolled its credits. I looked away to grab the remote.
When I turned back—he was across the street. Directly beneath my window. My body jolted backward. My chest hollowed out. He still wasn’t moving. Just standing there, still in that slight angle, head tilted now. Toward me. I could feel it. Not see it, not yet—but feel it. I closed the blinds and tried to laugh it off. Told myself it’d be fine in the morning. But sleep didn’t come.

The next day, I tried not to think about it. I worked from home, stayed away from the window. I didn’t even peek through the blinds. That night, I made dinner. Left the lights on. Watched a movie I barely absorbed. After midnight, I cracked the blinds and peeked out. He was back. Closer this time. Not hiding. Not shadowed. Standing under the flickering streetlight, as if he’d stepped forward to make sure saw him. I blinked. The microwave clock jumped. 12:17. 12:22. Five minutes. Gone. A blink. I turned back. He had moved again. Feet now angled toward my building.I stared, trying not to move, not to breathe. Eventually I turned away, closed the blinds. I locked the window and checked it twice. I slept on the couch, lights on, TV humming low. In the morning, everything looked normal. But I didn’t feel normal.

That night, I stood by the window. I wasn’t going to be surprised this time. I made coffee. I brought a notebook. I opened the blinds and waited. He was already on my side of the street. Not close—but closer than ever. At the sidewalk, head raised, eyes up. I wrote that down. Watched the clock. Then I blinked. Coffee cold. Notebook on the floor. Clock read 3:03 a.m. Last I checked? 1:41. I turned back to the window. He was at the front door of my building. I backed away. My heart wouldn’t stop pounding. The air in the room felt wrong. Heavier. I moved the chair to block the door. Triple checked the lock.I fell asleep upright. I woke up standing in the hallway. The chair had been moved. Not knocked over—just neatly slid aside. I hadn’t unlocked the door. The deadbolt was still latched. But on the wood, eye-level, was a smudge. Greasy. Human. The shape of a face. Pressed flat against the door, as if listening.

I tried taping my eyelids open. Didn’t work. Not because of the pain—though that came—but because blinking is more than eyelids. You twitch. You breathe. You glance. He moves when you’re not watching. That’s the rule. That’s when I realized: it isn’t the blinking. It’s the forgetting. He gets closer every time you stop paying attention. I haven’t left the apartment in days. Or maybe weeks. Time’s loose now. Slippery. One morning—if it was morning—I woke up with the blinds open. And the street below was full. Dozens of people. All still. All watching. All of them… me.
Different versions. Younger. Older. Sick. Dressed in things I hadn’t worn in years. And every single one of them looking up at my window. Unblinking. I didn’t scream. There was nothing left for screaming. I understood. I’d joined them.

Tonight, I caught my reflection blinking before I did. It wasn’t subtle. I wasn’t imagining it. It looked me in the eyes—my eyes—and blinked. Then smiled. The clocks don’t keep time anymore. They twitch and buzz. Like insects, frozen in glass. Now, they tell proximity. When they jump, he’s nearby. When they stop completely—he’s here. Sometimes, I hear someone calling my name from the other room. It’s my voice. But not quite right. A little hoarse. A little tired. Like it’s been waiting.
I think the next time I blink, I’ll be standing on the sidewalk. Still. Watching. Waiting. Maybe for someone else to move in. Maybe for someone to see me. All it takes is a second. One blink.That’s how it always begins.
