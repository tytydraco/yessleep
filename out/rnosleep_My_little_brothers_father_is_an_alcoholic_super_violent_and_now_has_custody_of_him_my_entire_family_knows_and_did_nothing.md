My mom has an Ex (My brothers dad) who she met in 2009. He seemed like a really good guy at first, he seemed to care about his dogs and seemed like he was excited to meet me. The first time I met my moms Ex was at a nearby park, he had his dogs with him and they were so playful and wild. I really grew to enjoy him and his dogs. My mom became pregnant with my little brother in 2010 and after they found out about my brother her Ex moved in.

Thats When my life started to become hell. I was diagnosed with Aspergers(Autism) when I was like 5 to 7. My moms Ex didn't understand what that meant was It takes me a little longer than an average person to learn new things and gain social skills, so, I(10 at this point) ended up lashing out a lot after he moved in. He became more and more controlling over me to the point I felt so stuck and unable to gain the confidence/strength to stand up to him or anybody for that matter, because every time I tried he would shut me down or make fun of me. There were times he would get physically violent with me too.

There was one time that I refused to pick something up off the floor and he got so upset that he put my favorite thing in the world in front of my face (A playstation one that my father got me for my first console) and as he held me on the floor on stomach he bashed my playstation with a hammer. This type of thing happened regularly as he is and has been an alcoholic with major anger issues to this day. After a few years of trying to get him to come around my mom had finally had enough and told him to leave one night after he hit her. He refused at first but I was barely able to work up the courage to tell him I called my grandparents who actually cared back at that point who live around the corner which I didn't actually call them. He left and ended up taking my mom to court over custody of my little brother.

DHS got involved Never did any sort of formal investigation so to this day my little brother has to live with the violence I went through and on top of that his new wife is pregnant. My grandparents still have my moms Ex over for coffee and pays him to help them and my aunt with housing repairs, such and have even prevented my mom from making any sort of dent in a court case. My mother has been accused of having Munchausen by proxy and not following the doctors instructions for her prescribed pills which is not true. My grandparents have gone and taken pictures of my moms house(its my grandparents rental house and I will Admit it is very messy) and have also taken pictures of my moms prescription medication for my moms Ex to use against her in court. I have even caught my grandma taking pictures of my moms meds.

 It's almost been 10 years since I've been able to have a relationship with my brother because He's been so out of control because his dad neglects him and lets him watch videos of baby bunnies getting their heads cut off and lots of violent pornographic content such as people abusing chickens. I just have no idea what to do at this point because he has his own business and make an insane amount of money and has been able to get a very good attorney who has helped him lie and cheat his way to victory in court. My mom has never had even decent money because she had to take care of me and my sister by herself when i was growing up.

With the amount of support from my own family, his family and over 100,000$ worth of money he got from his grandma after she passed I have no idea what to do. My mom and I have been trying to do everything on our own up until this point hence the post. Now she's been accused of brainwashing me to believe that every memory of these violent situations I have is false which is not true in the slightest. Any advise on what we should do would be awesome.
