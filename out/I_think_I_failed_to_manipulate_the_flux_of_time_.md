Finally our first unit exams were over and we were awaiting the results. I casually walked into my class only to find my friends sitting together listening to Abir with disbelief in their eyes. 

I joined them with a "Yo wassup" and Abir turned at me with a smirk saying "Guess who's gonna top the maths test". 

For context, I and our friend Anshuman have been competing with each other for the 'maths topper' position since childhood and Abir was dependent on us for passing his exam because he's 'bad with numbers' as he says. 

I replied "well idk let's see" 

Tina replied in a mocking tone "Bro thinks he's gonna top" 

Now I understood the reason behind the disbelief in their eyes. So this is what Abir was talking about! Oh this boy! 

I (Adhrita), Abir, Tina, Asif and Anshuman have been friends since childhood and all of us know about Abir's poor maths. Which is why none of us were believing him. Although he looked quite confident and just said "you'll see it yourself when results are out".

And to all of our surprise, Abir did top in maths! Our minds were blown away. Anshuman got 98, two marks deducted for skipping steps, I got 95 because I did one wrong. But Abir got a whopping 100 out of 100! 

"What's this magic bro?" Anshuman asked. 

"You won't believe what I discovered" Abir's voice trembled with excitement. 
"Do you guys remember that crazy scientist who disappeared a few years ago?" 

"You mean Dr. Swapnodeep Choudhury? The multi-talented scientist who defeated world champion chess player with no prior experience?" I asked.

"Exactly Adhrita!" replied Abir, "Few days ago I got into his abandoned laboratory to collect any discarded blueprints or machinery for our annual science fair. But my eyes fell on a gleaming device with an intricate interface. Beside it, a vial of iridescent fluid shimmered in the dim light, labeled as 'Genesis' " 

Abir continued to say how he couldn't resist testing it and with a few hesitant strokes of the keyboard, he typed out his deepest desire, i.e; to top his maths exam. The machine hummed to life with a faint glow, and as he placed a drop of Genesis fluid on his tongue, an overwhelming clarity filled his mind. On the day of exam, he effortlessly finished his paper, as if the solutions were pre-installed in his mind.

All of us stood silent after hearing this insane story. It sounds unbelievable, but Abir has topped in maths! Which is more unbelievable than his story.

So to clear all the doubts, we decided to visit the abandoned laboratory. 

The lab, though neglected, retained an air of mystery. The machine stood in the centre, surrounded by scattered notes and drawings of wild inventions. 

Asif, the daring one, suggested each of us to try the machine. After some debate, we agreed. 

At first the results were astounding. Asif who always struggled with art, painted a masterpiece. Anshuman developed an app that went viral overnight.
Tina, an aspiring chef, suddenly had the skills of a seasoned culinary master! I, who had been wearing specs since I was 7, suddenly could see everything clearly without glasses! 

We were elated, reveling our newfound abilities. But I felt a lingering unease, as if something was about to go wrong. 

Days passed, and all of us were enjoying our vacation. The first sign of trouble came when Abir, who had wished to become a master climber, went missing during a solo expedition. Search parties looked for him in that area, but he had vanished without a trace. 

Then Tina disappeared. One moment she was there preparing a lavish dinner, and the next, she was gone! Leaving behind only a half chopped carrot and a pot of boiling water. 

After these incidents, panic began to set in among the remaining of us. I contacted Anshu to let him know about my suspicion that these incidents were somehow related to that cursed device we used. Anshuman replied he suspected something similar. 

Anshu, now paranoid, dove into researching the machine and Dr. Swapnodeep Choudhury's past. While I and Asif tried to maintain a semblance of normalcy.

In the meantime Anshu found an old journal hidden within the lab's walls. He immediately called me over. The journal detailed Swapnodeep's experiments and his obsession with an alternate dimension where time was fluid and reality could be rewritten. The scientist had used the machine to manipulate events, winning an international chess game against the world champion despite having no experience. 

Now we understand how he did that! 

However, his victories came at a terrible price. The more he tampered with reality, the more unstable it became, leading to his eventual disappearance. His real self disappeared years ago, which means his current version is from a different dimension.

Our discovery coincided with Asif's disappearance and now only two of us were left. At this point, I totally lost my mind. 

Desperate and terrified, I decided to move to my country house in the village to avoid the consequences. When I thought I would be safe here, I encountered a peculiar man with piercing eyes who was introduced to be a well wisher of our family. I welcomed him and he seemed pretty chill at first. We were having a conversation when he casually revealed that HE IS Dr Swapnodeep! 

"You can't escape me" he hissed, a menacing smile spreading across his face. "I will find you and you will join the others."

Paralyzed by fear, I barely managed to flee. I was not familiar with the streets of this village but I kept running, didn't stop anywhere, until I bumped into someone on my way. 
He was my cousin, Ravi, an extremely talented research fellow. After looking at my devastating state he asked if I'm okay. I, breathless and frantic, told him everything while he listened intently, his face turning grim.

He revealed that he read about the curious case of Dr. Swapnodeep too. But he never knew all this information that I just told him. "We need to confront this head-on", Ravi said, "come with me". 

My brain had already stopped functioning, so I blindly followed him. I regained my consciousness with Ravi's exclamation "Here we are". And I noticed we've reached the cursed laboratory! What! Is Ravi involved in this? I asked him the same, suspicion creeping into my voice. 

He shook his head "No, but I understand how it works. You've used the machine, you have the power within you. The ability to manipulate reality, just like Swapnodeep. You can stop this..." 

"But how? I can't " I interrupted. 

"You'll have to figure it out by yourself. You can do this"

Ravi's words kept ringing in my ears. What should I do? How should I do it? My mind went blank.

With trembling hands, I approached the machine. I typed furiously, with all my fear and desperation into words "This machine never existed, nobody created it, and it has no effect on anyone" 

As I finished, I felt a strange sensation, as if the world was shifting around me. The machine began to glow, brighter and brighter, until it vanished in a flash of light. 

I opened my eyes and found myself back in the lab, but it was different; dust-free, well-lit, and devoid of the ominous presence it once held.
My friends were there too, confused but unharmed. They had no memories of the machine or the horrors they had experienced. I hugged them all, tears started streaming down my face. 

My eyes fell on an old newspaper on the table. I took it and read the headline which says that Swapnodeep lost the chess match. Finally I felt relieved and sighed. 

But suddenly the headline changed before my eyes! It declared Swapnodeep had won the game, and this time with a higher rating than before! 

Despite my efforts, reality was still in flux. A chill ran down my spine.
The newspaper fell off my hand.
