Below are the notes I took on my phone during the expirence 

Sorry for any grammar but then again it was kver 72 hours of no sleep

Day 1:

 But It was pretty much just a regular day drowsy and whatnot but that's natural 
I stayed home, 

worked out showerd, and I played cyberpunk from sometime around 8pm to 6am I started the game.

 By the time I was done I owned all 4 apartments in the game a hypercar and a porche 911

Granted I don't watch people play video games nor do I expect anyone to understand my video game rambling but let me just say I think I'm good at the game hopefully it'll carry my through this experience 



Day 2:

 Of no sleep summary
I can't remember most details of the day  but i know that I spoke with some folks some who had a positive and some who had a negative impact on this little science expirement im trying. 

my vision was moving almost like when mushrooms start to peak the ground moving shadows dancing about and my body is either entirely numb or I can feel every nerve ending. although I did also cheif my buddies cart quite a bit so who knows what affect that had.

 even while feeling on the brink of death I still cannot manage to shut the fuck up. 

But then again I was very high. Got home did all the basic errands eat shower all that jazz although today all I ate was technically just a drumstick. Played cyberpunk until...



Day 3:

 Technically I guess I don't know i didn't sleep last 6 am and I won't sleep this one it currently being  about an hour before as of writing this sentence.

 I refuse to sleep until I feel I'm in actual danger. I don't know if it's an emotional response or comfort in discomfort or whatever. Today is going to need so much more cuban coffee. 

Side note I now also have been hearing cyberpunk sound effects. From the game. Like the ambient sounds of night city swimming around  my head to where I can't quite tell if they were real or place them but I know it's just my brain i don't mind though there's no terror or fear its quite fascinating to witness.

 you know that the hallucinations are in your mind and being the smartest albeit not the sanest person that I know

 I can recognize what I'm seeing isn't real and how it simply can't be and yet here I found myself looking at my kitchen floor tiles before leaving for school and swearing by all the powers or lack there of within me because physically I'm exhausted that I was staring at sand at the beach

as a person who wears contact lenses let me just say it has been hard on my eyes 
accidentally left them in all night day 2 even eyes are still red from that or just the lack of sleep, 

if I'm not sleeping I still gotta take the contacts out let my eyes breathe and my contacts re soak themselves in the solution another comparison to make is the lack of sleep makes your vision look similar in a way fuzzy, out of focus,

 where you can't quite trust the gaze you're holding even when looking directly in front of you  also I can't tell If I've had like a few vision flashes or if I'm blinking startling myself and the light when I open my eyes again is startling me I may never have the answer 

Almost 6 am swear I saw the word "love" written in purple on the inside of left eyelid no clue how or why

I sat down and Saw an ingrown hair on my leg i picked at it a bit and I swore the hairs moving looked just like a spider I looked closer and it looked like the spider had gone into me I scratched the bloody hell out of the leg... there was no spider this no sleep thing is no joke

HOLY FUCKING SHIT THIS DAY WENT BAD
 
My best friend had a seizure right next to me in the bathroom and I had to hold him in my arms and beg him to wake up while hitting him and everyone else ran away he woke up thank god be he didn't know where, when, or who he was for a solid few minutes this whole time im crying,
 
trampled some kid out of my way to get to him before he fell all the way and his head his the concrete I just barley caught it his eyes rolled back he made a noise almost like choking or a cough and then just started to lean back and didn't stop Til I grabbed him then he shook one arm was wrapped around him to keep him steady and head up.

Well I'm traumatized my Buddy woke up and the whole time he was cracking jokes half the time I was laughing so hard I was so damn happy he was alive and the other half I wanted to beat the absolute fuck out of him for doing that shit to me. He went to the hospital he's gonna be all good.

The rest of the day I've spent muttering myself to stay up and seeing things the lights are hurting 

right here is the peak of this high I've been chasing this is the moment of action of decision do I sleep or do I go for day 4 I do not know how I'll manage or if I'll survive but alas what am I if not a scientist pushing boundaries.

It's midnight and I looked out the window I'm not trucker but I can say with almost certainty that when I looked down in thr yard in the bushes for a moment i saw a black dog. 

Bad omens are no good to see on lack of sleep you can't tell If there things are real or not 

I slept.

Some time between 1-3 am i fell asleep in my chair until 8 in the morning where I promptly 
got in my bed and slept until 6pm

Lack of sleep is no joke dude although I must admit the expirence was kinda fun

DONT DO THIS!
