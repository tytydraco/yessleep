It might've been a Monday when he started. Usually the new ones start Friday but he missed the intake 'cause some psycho lady shot his Pop in the leg with a rifle. His Nan needed looking after twenty four seven so he had to stay home. That's what Shelly said she'd overheard Pamela say to the other office lady, can't remember her name.

First thing was how tall. Shelly reckons the doorways are six foot seven so when this fella had to bend down to walk through, we were amazed. We all managed to pretend like it was normal, though. Didn't want him uncomfortable on his first day you know with us small towners relating like he's some circus freak.

And Shelly being the usual wally I saw her twice glance at his crotch before looking over at Pam. Nah she definitely did. Monica the stand-in TL was introducing him and we're all in a semi-circle and her and Pam were so obvious about it. Pretty much what you'd expect in a rural call centre like ours, where it's been fifteen women plus one poor Brian the past two years, who's the only bloke left since Darryl, Shelly's ex, passed away. 

Good thing Brian's in a wheelchair these days, is all I'll say. 

Ashton was his name. He didn't smile or say much, just followed Monica around with a kind of Lurch vibe before sitting at his pod, where he didn't move the rest of the day. 

Our pods back then were six to a large desk split by these flimsy partitions, and Ashton's PC was on the other side behind me, two pods down. So that's if I turned around it's Katie, and Ashton was over the other side at the wall, next to Shelly. 

Good old Shelly. Oh and the other office lady's name from before was Tina, just remembered.

So it wasn't much out of the ordinary. Unassuming as he was physically imposing, basically. When Shelly brought her Anzac biscuits in special because it was his birthday, I'd say that's when he came out of his shell finally. Weird thing seeing him get animated, all of a sudden.

He didn't eat any though, just wrapped several in tissue paper for his Nan. We even exchanged a few words on break the next day, me and him. He was waiting for the water to boil and we laughed about how shit the instant coffee was. Fucking International Roast. I remember thinking, you know what, he's actually not that creepy when he laughs. 

After the ice was broken he asked about Shelly more than anything else. Figured he didn't realise how obvious he was making out that he fancied her back, and I didn't mind helping. about five years ago Shelly's ex hubby ago ran off with a younger lass, so good for her. Best I could do was play wingman for her and s younger bloke without making a big deal out of it.

Some of his questions, though. Wish I'd written them down. They weren't all normal, put it that way. This one in particular, wanted to know all about what colours Shelly wore the most. Like, how often she wore a green dress. How often she wore this weirdly shaped green necklace. How often she baked for the office and what was she wearing on the days she brought homemade goodies in, like those Anzac biscuits. He snuck them questions in so naturally that I didn't notice till later, how strange they were.

I can remember the colour one because it turns out he was colourblind. He did like Shelly, he told me, and because he could only see certain shades of brown and grey, he preferred getting to know people first of all through the colours they wore. Especially people he liked. This is what he says to me. When something is harder to focus on, you can learn it on a deeper level, he explained. Guess he must've learned a lot more the harder way in life.

Way over my lazy head, plus sounded like some bullshit. But this about brings us up to speed. Shelly didn't show this morning, and it's been over a week since anyone's heard from Ashton. He just stopped coming in. His Pop passed away not long after his second birthday here, about two months ago that was, and he wasn't the same after that. And then he kept getting worse.

Last I saw him he was gaunt, hunched over, even more than usual, and barely acknowledged me. Looked like a cold death barely warmed-up. Our regular TL Donna confided one day that she didn't know what to do with him. His performance had dropped so much that he was failing every KPI metric, even though he'd had the best first year out of any of us, apparently.

And then, Shelly. I figured the two of them finally met outside of work, because she was buzzing all of a sudden. 

She also, rather curiously, started wearing a lot more green. Not sure I'd have noticed if it wasn't for Ashton and his weird questions the previous year, but there it was. Every day it was some new green item, like new skirts or socks or a pendant she had on. And she started packing on the kilos, too, which could only mean she was baking extra. Which all us girls knew she only ever did when she was shagging.

Still you'd never see that vibe from Ashton. He was taciturn at the best of times, and between the weight-loss and obvious grief he made a sore contrast to the woman apparently now his lover. You know for an office small as ours it was a wonder no-one knew for sure. But Shelly wouldn't budge when asked. Just smiled and changed the subject. And there was no getting blood out of Lurch-boy Ashton. So the rest of us sleuthed what we could, gossiped on smokebreaks, and moved on. Never a doubt in my mind, though.
They were definitely fucking.

And I think to confirm that fact, as a kind of wink to me and Katie, two of us being the only others he ever spoke to besides Shelly, Ashton brought in his own batch of Anzacs last week. Bloody delicious, they were. Dare I say even better than Shelly's. But it was really the green shoes and rings that made it obvious, what he was communicating. Maybe the driest sense of humour I've encountered. Certainly the weirdest.

Was an old recipe of his Nan's passed down the family, Ashton told me. That's why they looked so odd, his Anzacs did, and why they tasted so good. 

Good thing he brought a tub full too because otherwise Shelly might've eaten them all on her own. It's like she couldn't stop from the moment he undid the lid. Katie and I lost count, but she must've eaten at least twenty of the things.

The next day, Ashton was just gone. Donna tried calling a few times, but there's bugger all reception where he lives. We just hope he's alright. Not much more we can do, really. Shelly wasn't too interested in helping, either. Still playing coy about their relationship the whole time and made out she didn't know anything more than we did. Even though her vibe said otherwise. And over the past week she must've packed another five kilos on, and there's been this darkness on her face getting worse. Much worse in fact. Looked half crazed yesterday, like she hadn't slept in a month. Donna couldn't get in touch with her either this morning.

These office romances. Real wildcards, ain't they? Take Shelly's last office fling, Brian, for example. His allergies meant he could never eat her Anzacs, and so he'd just pretend to eat them while palming the crumbs to his pockets. When she found out what he was doing, she grabbed an old rifle, loaded it, apparently shot him square the right kneecap. It was her who reported the accident. Brian was just too nice to press charges. That's the story, anyway, and we only know that much because of what Brian's ex wife told Pamela, who told Katie, who told Barbara, who somehow told me before Pamela even knew.

Actually, there's Brian now, on his new wheelchairâ€”the one handed down from Ashton's Nan, who died from that nasty gastro last year. Looks good on him, if that was a thing. 

Poor bloody Ashton though. Hope he's alright. Thinking I'll wear green tomorrow, in case it makes any difference.
