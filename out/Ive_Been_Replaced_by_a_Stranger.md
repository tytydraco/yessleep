You know that feeling you get when someone is oddly familiar, but you’ve never met them? This was exactly what it felt like when I saw him for the first time. It was a chance encounter, but I later realized I had simply delayed the inevitable. I’ve always struggled with crippling alcoholism on and off. I would often go through waves of sobriety mixed with periods of drinking, and the night before all of this started was a particularly heavy alcohol binge. I was used to waking up in odd places with little to no memory, so when my crusted eyes saw I was in an alleyway near my house, I was disappointed, but not at all surprised. 



It must have been around ten in the morning, and the weather was beautiful, adding insult to my sorry state. I staggered to my feet, bracing the wall, and took some slow breaths. All I had to do was make it a few blocks, and I’d be home, to my wife, a bed, and maybe some hot food if she wasn’t too angry with me. God, she’s so forgiving. I can’t believe she hadn’t already left me by this point. 



I began walking out of the alleyway, and turned left to start my walk home. I noticed a man a few inches taller than me crossing the street, and I instantly felt the feeling I mentioned earlier. I consider myself a decent looking guy, six foot, semi-muscular build, blue eyes, but he was like a modern day Hercules. He was a few inches taller, tanned, with big-but-not-too-big muscles. And not only were his eyes also blue, their sharpness but mine to shame. He was carrying a bag of groceries, and very politely excused himself as he brushed past me on the street. 



Snapped from my trance, I ignored my unsettled feeling and continued towards home, around ten yards behind this tall stranger. I was nearing my street, and he turned onto it ahead of me. I found this odd- my neighborhood was tightly knit and I’d never seen him before. At the time though, I’d assumed he was from out of town, a relative of one of my neighbors. As I also turned down my street, I noticed him walking up my driveway. This made my stomach drop. This situation had adultery written all over it.



Quickening my pace, I yelled at Hercules, who was reaching for something in his pocket. Seeing me moving towards him, he quickly pulled out a set of keys, unlocked MY front door, dashed in, and closed it. Now teeming with rage, I pulled out my own keys, and made for the door. Thinking about what to say to my wife, and what to do with this piece of garbage in my house, I put my key in the lock, and turned. But the key wouldn’t budge. I took it out, looked at it, and it was definitely my front door key. I tried again. Still nothing. By now I was really starting to freak out. I banged on the door. 



I yelled to my wife to let me in, so we could talk. I heard rapid footsteps and the same blue eyes appeared in the small window of the door. He asked me what I wanted with his wife, and demanded to know who I was. I screamed back that I could ask him the exact same thing. Then I saw Alice appear behind him. Scared, she looked to the stranger for reassurance, and said something I couldn’t hear. He told me that if I didn’t leave, he was going to call the police. I said go ahead, they would help me sort this out. 

I stayed on the porch until an annoyed police officer arrived, and explained the situation to her. He knocked on the door, and seeing that the officer was in our presence, they opened it, but did not step outside. I could smell my house! I could feel the memories that place held through me, like adrenaline. But I felt like an outsider, looking in at a long lost memory. 



The tall man went on to explain that I, a complete stranger, had followed him to his home, and harassed his wife. The officer eyed me suspiciously, and I knew instantly that she didn’t believe me anymore. I looked haggard, and it was two against one. The officer asked me for some I.D, and I pulled out my wallet, but all of my cards were missing. The only thing that remained inside was some bills and loose change, and an old condom. Seeing this, the officer told me I needed to leave, and to stop bothering my wife and the stranger. I begged Alice to stop this facade, that I’d learned my lesson, but she just avoided eye contact with me as I was slowly pushed back to the street. 



As I sat on the curb, in slight disbelief, an idea came over me. The officer was getting into her car, but I yelled at her to wait. I pulled my phone from my pocket and ran over. I explained how I had pictures with my wife and that these could prove my story. The officer said nothing, but didn’t get into her car. I unlocked my phone, went into the photos app, and saw hundreds of photos of my wife, but with the tall man. How was that even possible? It was as though I’d been gently plucked from every photo, and replaced. 



The officer took one look at these, grabbed my phone, and threw me into the backseat. I watched with despair as she walked to my house, and gave my phone to the stranger. Just before he closed the door, I could have sworn he looked at me and smirked.   
  


I was dropped off a few kilometers away, and warned once again to not go near my house. I slowly made my way to a dingy internet cafe, where I’m writing this all out, as evidence for the future, if I ever need it. 



The sun’s going down.  

I’m going back to my house tonight. I’m going to set things straight. 

I’m going to kill that tall man.



---------------



I went back. And I’ve come to a realization that I need to get off my chest. But I have to first write down the rest of what happened, even though it doesn’t matter anymore. 



Once the sun went down, I took a bus to my neighborhood. When I got on, it was just me and a really, really, old man, who was sitting all the way at the back. He had an odd face, one that was long like that mask from V for Vendetta. He had a long beard, and a faded red tracksuit. He laughed and laughed, staring at me for the entire trip. Once I’d gotten off, he looked at me through the window with a menacing grin, and waved as the bus drove away. 



I began down my street, moving slowly, with my eyes on a swivel. I’d decided that the best place to go into the house would be from the fenced in backyard. I inched my way around the side of the building, and as I did, I could hear faint music, and laughing. This only furthered my anger. I quietly opened the fence gate that was never locked, and went into the tool shed that sat at the back of the yard. 



From here, I had a decently clear view of our upstairs bedroom, the kitchen, and the back porch. At the moment I could see the stranger and my wife cooking together, all dressed up, wine in hand. My wife looked so damn happy, happier than I’d ever seen her. I sat for what felt like hours and hours, watching as they ate, danced, and slowly moved upstairs. As the stranger got into bed with my wife, I heard a faint ‘I love you’ float from my wife’s mouth and out through the open window. 



It was then and there that I realized I wouldn’t be setting foot in my house. I wasn’t going to kill that stranger, and oddly enough, I wasn’t angry anymore. 



I think I died in that alleyway.



I think this is all some twisted version of hell where I’m forced to watch the man I could have been taking care of the one person in this world who means anything to me. 



Alice, if by some impossible coincidence you find this, I’m so, so, sorry. I wish I could go back, because I swear to god, I would have done so many things differently. 



Goodbye Alice.
