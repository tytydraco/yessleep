Hello again everyone who may be paying attention to this. This story will be continuing right where it was left off. I’ve gotten a bit of positivity which is very appreciated. This second part will explain the Much More Than That part of the title. Some may not believe it, but we know what we saw. Thank you.

As we pursued Jonah through the dark forest,the sound of our footsteps were accompanied only by the natural noise of wind and crackling branches. The beams of light were our north star, leading us deeper into the woods. We managed to keep Jonah in sight for a good while but eventually we were all out of breath, Jonah sinking into the inky black our lights could not reach into. “That wasn’t Jonah.” Charlie said, worried.
“N-no no. That was Jonah. He’s just going through another episode. I thought he’d gotten over these bouts though.” David said in response. I had an idea of what was going on, but I didn’t want to sound insane. David and Charlie had never known the pain of losing a loved one, not even a dog.

As we moved through the woods, twigs and dying leaves crunching beneath our feet, we noticed something strange. The leaves of the trees around us were a brackish grey, the ground was black as though it were scorched by flame, and the trees had dark, sinister bark. “What the fuck is wrong with this place?” David said, scanning the trees around us with his light. “Not sure. Looks corrupted. Dead. I don’t really know what to call it.” Charlie responded as we pushed on. A deafening sound stopped us in our tracks.

As we stood, backs to each other and close, we flashed our lights all around us. The deafening crack of trees snapping in the wind echoed through the night air. None of us could pinpoint where the sound was coming from, the ground rumbling near us, the distinct sound of roots ripping from the ground. Rising from the dirt, like a zombie from a cemetary, is the rotten and ripped corpse of a large deer, inanimate and bled dry. “O-oh my-” David’s exclamation was cut short by wet vomit creeping out of his body, sloshing against the dirt. “Damn. Thats a big buck. What could have done this?” Charlie asked rhetorically. 

“CATHERINE!! PLEASE!” We heard Jonah exclaim from a distance. “Jonah. Come on guys, it sounds like he’s this way. Quickly!” I said before running deeper into the black forest.  As we got ever so deeper into the forest, our surrounding blackened. Even with our lights it was hard to see. Massive trees with black bark surrounded us, bulbs of black sap protruded from the bark, resembling bulging black oil creeping its way from a nozzle.
The deeper we went the more I wished to leave. I could hear my mothers voice calling to me, saying what she said in the hospital. “I can’t go on. There is nothing more they can do.” Loudly, I could hear the yelps of my dog echoing into the night, and I could even hear the songs of my bird I once owned. Then, Jonah. I could hear him. Like he was talking straight into my ear. “I just want to see her again, tell her I love her. Tell her I’m sorry.” What he said over and over again, drunk. I felt dread. Guilt.

Snapping me from my thoughts was Charlie, yet again. “Guys. Look.” his finger and light were pointed at a sinister cavity of roots, black bulbs, and split earth. It descended into an inky black darkness that our lights barely could penetrate. Inside we could hear Jonah, breathing heavily. “J-Jonah?”
David said, fear trembling in his voice. I rushed in, walking at a speed that almost made me fall over. “Jonah! Please, you have to hear us man!” I shouted into the darkness. Breathing was the only response. 

Standing in my light was Jonah. He was standing before something that gave me chills and caused distress to simply look upon. An obsidian black tree, it’s branches reaching into the ground above it, and its roots like bulging veins running beneath our feet. A singular eye as big as a basketball stared at Jonah from a knot in its bark. It was creaking and bleeding an oozing black matter that seemed lije a primordial soup, of which Jonah drank from. “JONAH! PLEASE!” Charlie pleaded, now crying. A split formed in the skin of this tree, unfurling in a foul cavity of splinter and deep reaching flesh. “I’m coming. Coming to make things right…” Jonah said, with a dark finality before being pierced by what seemed to be a kind of wooden tongue protruding from the wooden entity’s mouth. 

Blood rushed from the massive wound, its barbs digging into Jonahs back as if to drag him in. “N-NO!” Charlie shouted, pain ringing out from his  throat. I rushed forward, to grab Jonah and keep in away from this thing. “DAVID, BREAK IT!” David rushed forth, stumbling on his feet, and grabbed the things tongue. As David tried to split the tongue, he looked at his now  wounded and helpless friend. “I. I-I can’t! I can’t break it!” The entity shrieked as David attempted to break it, and began pulling harder. “Quickly! I can’t hold on much-” I fell to my stomach, the ground knocking the wind from me. David stumbled against the wall, Charlie as well. I looked up. Jonah’s limp body was fallen, and slowly dragged into the darkness.  Charlie tried grabbing him again but he couldn’t. Charlie was sobbing. “JONAAAAH!!!” He said, before breaking down and morphing into a fetal pose, crying. The tree let out a guttural gurgle before its eldritch maw threaded shut, it’s eye closing. David scrambled to his feet, pounding on the wood of the tree. “NO! YOU GIVE HIM BACK! MONSTER! DEMON! BEAST! FUCKING THING!” David bellowed, his fists pounding against the solid surface. 

“guys. he’s… he’s gone. Jonah is gone. we should… we should go back before we are too..” I said, struggling to my feet. David slumped against the tree. “Yeah. I guess. Come on Charlie.” Charlie was mess of tears and clearly displayed pain. “I-I-I c-can’t.” David hoisted Charlie to his feet, wrapping Charlie’s arm around his shoulder, Charlies feet dragging behind.

The way back was a quiet, depressing walk. Charlie’s sobs were the only thing breaking the sound of our footsteps. When we got back, David sat Charlie on the couch, and immediately went to the kitchen. The sound of ripping cloth and glass bottles were ringing throughout the cabin. I asked what he was doing. “We’re burning it. I will do it my fucking self if I have to!” David growled through gritted teeth. “Yes. We will.” I said, helping David. The rest of the night was us preparing to the sound of Charlie’s hysteria.

The next morning, we went out. We tried to find the tree but we couldn't. We retraced our steps several times to no avail. Even his truck was gone We decided to pack up and leave, informing the police and Jonahs parents that he was lost in the woods, and that we couldn’t find him. It didn’t feel right lying, but nobody would believe the truth. 

David, Charlie and I remained best friends. We were much closer now, and spent our days helping others move on from grief or addiction. Jonah was addicted, and we didn’t see the signs. A part of him died with Cathy the night of the accident. We were too slow to help him. Never again. David Charlie and I did whatever we could to help others with what Jonah was suffering from, not that it made us feel any better. We missed Jonah, and regularly talk about him even now. 

 Once, every year. We spend a weekend at the cabin, with Jonahs room left as it was. We built him a sort of memorial by the lake, each of us gathering around it to say what we can to him. Every so often, out there, I see him. Gesturing to me to follow him. But we know what that is. It isn’t Jonah. Its the tree, attempting to bait us with our guilt. But we know better. Our friend is gone. And we all miss him dearly. If you ever find yourself in the woods and see what you have lost, please don’t follow.
