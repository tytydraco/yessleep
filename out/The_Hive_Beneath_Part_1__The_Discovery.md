I should have known something was off when I got the job at the Antarctic research station. The pay was too good, the contract too vague. But I was desperate, and the idea of spending a year in the most isolated place on Earth seemed like a perfect escape from my troubles. Little did I know, I was walking into humanity's worst nightmare.

The first month was uneventful. Just me and five other researchers, huddled in our state-of-the-art facility, surrounded by endless white. We ran our experiments, collected data, and tried not to go stir-crazy. Dr. Emerson studied ice cores, Dr. Chen focused on atmospheric anomalies, Lisa monitored wildlife patterns, and I assisted where needed. The others, Johnson and Patel, kept to themselves, working on some classified project.
That all changed the day Dr. Emerson detected an anomaly in the ice sheets. It started as a faint vibration, barely noticeable. But it grew stronger each day, until the entire station was thrumming with it. We traced the source to a point about a mile from the base. Against protocol, we decided to investigate.

The drilling took days. As we bored deeper into the ancient ice, the vibrations intensified. Our equipment started malfunctioning, compasses spinning wildly. At night, we all complained of strange dreams - visions of vast, dark spaces and writhing shapes. I caught Johnson talking to himself more than once, muttering about "the voices in the ice."

At 300 meters, we hit a cavity. The camera we lowered showed only darkness at first, then movement. Thousands, maybe millions, of shapes writhing in the void. We told ourselves they were just strange deep-ice organisms. We were wrong.
That night, as we reviewed the footage, Patel noticed something terrifying. The creatures were organized, moving in complex patterns. And they were getting closer to the surface. We debated alerting the outside world but decided to gather more data first. It was a fatal mistake.

They came for us three days later. The ice exploded upwards, and they poured out. Grotesque, chitinous things, each the size of a dog, with too many legs and eyes that glowed with alien intelligence. They moved as one, a single mind controlling countless bodies. Dr. Chen was the first to fall, swarmed and dragged screaming back into their hole.

We sealed ourselves in the main lab, but we knew it was only a matter of time. They were in the walls now, burrowing through insulation, their hivemind probing for weaknesses. We could hear them skittering, always just out of sight. The vibrations grew so intense it felt like our skulls would shatter.

Yesterday, they found the ventilation system. We lost Dr. Emerson and Lisa. Their screams still echo in my head. Now it's just me, Johnson, and Patel. But Johnson's losing it. He keeps saying he can hear them talking to him, promising him things. I don't trust him.

I'm sending this message on all frequencies, praying someone receives it. If you're reading this, stay away from Antarctica. Nuke the entire continent if you have to. They're not just under the ice here; this is merely where they're waking up. I can hear them in my mind now, their alien thoughts seeping into my consciousness. They've been sleeping for millions of years, waiting. And now, they're hungry.

Patel thinks he's found a way to disrupt their communication using sound waves. We're going to test it, but I'm not optimistic. The door won't hold much longer. I can see it bulging, about to give way. If anyone finds this, tell the world. Tell them about the hive beneath. Tell them to run. Tell them-

Oh god, Johnson just opened the door. His eyes... they're not human anymore. The creatures are pouring in. Patel is screaming. I can feel them crawling on me, their alien minds pressing against mine. I won't let them take me. I won't become one of them. I'm going to set off the emergency destruct sequence. It won't stop them, but it might slow them down.

This is humanity's last warning. They're coming. They're already among us. Trust no one. Fight the whispers in your mind. And whatever you do, don't let them-
