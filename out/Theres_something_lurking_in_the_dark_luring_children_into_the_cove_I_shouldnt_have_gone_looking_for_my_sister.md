My sister and I live in a quaint town beside a sea cliff in the Pacific Northwest. Below the cliff is a cove that is only accessible during low tide. Over the years, people have seen something lurking in the darkness at night, coming from the cove.



In recent weeks, kids around town have been hearing tapping and scratching at their bedroom windows as they sleep again. When they peer out the window, they see something watching them from the shadows with milky white eyes, whispering their names.



They say the creatures disguise their voices to sound like someone familiar—a friend or a family member—people who have disappeared—to lure them outside their homes to the sea cliff and into the cove.



Growing up, I thought these stories were our parents' way of scaring us, keeping my sister and me from sneaking out of the house at night. 



That all changed nine months ago when Amara disappeared.



••



The night my sister vanished, Amara’s favorite hoodie, shoes, and gold bracelets were nowhere to be found. People suspected the usual: She had simply snuck out of the house in the middle of the night; she was a teenager, after all.

  
But this theory couldn’t explain why her bedroom window was left propped open. It didn’t explain the strange claw marks etched across the windowsill, or the peculiar, putrid smell of rot that hung in the air just outside it. 



Twenty-four hours later, Amara still hadn’t turned up, so the police organized a community-wide search party to try to find her. Family and friends put up missing posters in town, handed out fliers at school, and posted all over social media. Like the vanished children before her, there was even a local news spotlight after Amara had gone missing. 



After a few days, people started to fear that something more sinister had happened than her running away. Tensions were high, and rumors spread throughout the town like wildfire: Amara had been abducted, she was caught in an ocean current, swept out to sea, or worse.



We searched night and day for weeks, exploring the forest, beaches, and hiking trails. Police even organized diving crews to scan the ocean depths. 



Nothing. No body, no evidence of where she might have gone.

  
After a couple of weeks, the search parties ended, just as they had for the missing children before Amara. The posters and social media posts faded, and people moved on. Everyone, my parents included, just gave in to the idea that she was gone.



But not me. I knew deep down that Amara had not vanished. She hadn’t run away. It was the creatures from the stories whispered around town. They had visited her at night, tapping at her window, whispering her name, luring her outside and into the cove.



The next low tide is tonight, and I’m going into the cove to find Amara.

I snuck out of the house to the sea cliff, climbing my way down the craggy rock face to find the black cavern carved into the rock. Thankfully, the moon was full tonight, helping to illuminate the steep descent. The cove's opening is hidden between two colossal rock faces that jet out from the jagged sea cliff. I’ve been inside a dozen times, but never wandered too deep. Tonight would be different. 



The pitch-black entrance gaped open as I approached, showing rock formations inside that looked like teeth. I took a deep breath, ensuring I had brought my knife with me, before flipping on my flashlight and taking the first steps into the maw. 



I entered the first chamber. Even with the moonlight outside penetrating the night sky, the cavern's interior was draped in darkness. The only light was the cone emanating from my flashlight. The ceilings are vaulted, and a series of corridors lead to the massive cave system within. 



Stepping further in, I shouted into the darkness. *“Amara, if you’re in here, please say something. It's your sister!”*



I stopped to listen for any sounds that might hint at her whereabouts deep in the cave system. Nothing. The air was still. The only noise came from my lungs forcing out my erratic breath. My heart began racing as my eyes tried to adjust to the darkness.



I pushed forward, taking a path veering off to the right. The ceiling quickly fell, forcing me to crouch over and shimmy through. I continued progressing through the cavernous maze, stopping at each room to scan for evidence of my missing sister. 



With every passageway and chamber resembling the last, the cavern and its corridors started to feel disorienting. I shook off my nerves and plunged deeper into the belly of the cave system, going left, right, left, up, down. 



I was starting to get discouraged when suddenly, through the darkness, I heard footsteps off in the distance. I stopped abruptly and focused my light in the direction of the noise.



Then, in the distance, I caught something moving quickly out of the light—a shadow slipping back into the darkness.



*“Hello?”*

  
My voice echoed, bouncing chaotically off the rock.

  
*“Amara!?”*

  
No response–probably just my mind playing tricks. The commotion stopped—the silence was deafening.

  
*Keep going.*

  
The next passageway was just large enough to squeeze through, requiring me to crawl on my hands and knees, inching my way through the narrow tunnel, when suddenly, ahead of me, I heard whispering.

  
“Amara, is that you? Don’t move. I’ll be right there!”



I quickly made my way into the next chamber when an overwhelming stench of rotten flesh hit me. The same smell from the windowsill outside my sister’s room, the night she disappeared. I cover my nose and mouth with my forearm, doing everything I can to keep the contents of my stomach down.



The sudden movement sends chaotic beams of light from my flashlight around the room. There, against the rockface, was a large pile. I got closer to inspect the pile. It was a mess of bones mixed with flesh and shreds of clothing. Several broken skulls and chunks of flesh, human flesh. 



The earth surrounding the pile was stained red. I steadied myself and stepped back when a sudden flashing glimmer caught my eye—my sister's gold bracelets. 



No. No. No.



As I try to comprehend what my eyes are observing, I hear scurrying footsteps behind me. 



I snap around—my heart begins pounding, trying to escape my chest. Trying to warn me to run out of this place as fast as possible. I can feel a presence in the dark, like I’m being watched. Another noise from elsewhere in the room. No, not a noise, *Amara’s voice calling my name*. But now I know–*that can’t be her.* 



Suddenly, in the direction of the voice, I can see the silhouette of something standing there, motionless. 



Its head is tilted unnaturally to the side. Its arms extend unnaturally long, its spindly fingers reaching below its knees with long black nails. It has long, wiry hair that falls toward the floor, covering most of its face except for its eyes. The creature’s milky white eyes fixed on mine.



My heart feels like it’s about to burst out of its cage. 



Thu-thump. Thu-thump. THU-THUMP.



Suddenly, from behind me, something lets out a blood-curdling shriek. I feel a sharp pain followed by a warm, damp sensation running down my leg and the smell of metal and rot. I quickly craned my neck back to see another creature standing over me, its claws extended, dripping with blood. Its mouth gaping open, displaying rows of gnashing, serrated teeth.



I manage to grab my knife from my jacket pocket, driving it into the creature's chest. It lets out a horrific scream—a split second for me to escape its grasp. A single thought crosses my mind. 



*Run.*



I retraced my steps, crawling back through the small tunnel as quickly as possible. My leg is throbbing from the wound, leaving a bloody, wet trail across the rock beneath me. I can hear the creatures following behind me, trying to drag me back into the darkness. 



*Don’t stop, don’t look back. Keep moving.*



Finally, after scrambling through the endless cave system, I can hear waves and the trickle of sea water entering the cove ahead. I’m close. I run as fast as I can through the final chamber to reach the cavern exit and tumble onto the beach. The tide has come back in, and waves are crashing above my knees as they threaten to flood the entry to the cove again.



Now standing on the beach, I take a second to look back and listen to make sure those creatures aren’t still stalking me. I don’t hear the shrieks or whispers, but I can’t shake the sense that they’re watching me right there, beyond the cove's entrance.

They released me from the hospital after getting stitches and antibiotics to treat the wound. The doctor wrapped my leg to keep it from getting infected and sent me home. The pain of knowing Amara was taken into that cove and mutilated by those things hurt far worse than my lacerations.



Since then, I’ve had recurring nightmares of being trapped in the cove, running from chamber to chamber, just out of the creature’s grasp. I finally fell asleep tonight, only to be abruptly awakened to a sound outside my bedroom window.



Tap. Screeeech. Tap.



I snapped awake, my nerves electrified, a wave of dread overcoming me. I quickly made my way to the bedroom window and looked out. There, hiding in the shadows just beyond the tree line, I could see a dark figure. Its gaze fixed to mine—milky white eyes—Amara’s voice calling my name.



I froze in terror, the same thought repeating in my head.



*That’s not your sister. Don’t open the window.*
