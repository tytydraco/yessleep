Do you ever wonder what it’s like to live in one of those old New England towns from your favorite horror novels? How your childhood friend who made you watch horror films on DVDs always romanticized Maine because Stephen King novels and the cryptid museum made it seem like the scary dream place to be. Or maybe you’re just a history buff and the name William means something to you. A name that was important at one point in time. A founding father or the founder of the local armada from 1776 to 1832. New England seems to overall have somewhat of a choke hold on pop culture.

  
I couldn’t give two shits though.

  
Witch City. Salem, Massachusetts. Wicked witches this, witches that. A load of wicked bullshit. Did you know they didn’t even kill those girls here? That was the town over. Modern day Salem is a lot smaller than it used to be back in colonial days.

  
Nowadays: it’s the epitome of tourist trap. Ocean breeze and sleazy shop owners selling Halloween themed trinkets year round by the old wharf. Color it purple and slap a cat on it and you’re guaranteed to make a good chunk of change during the busier times of the year. Store after store in old, historic apartments advertising the same mass produced gifts that will end up rotting in an attic two years after you bought it. If you don’t end up losing your footing on the brick sidewalks from the 1700s, maybe you’ll catch a tour group following some guy in a top hat with a fancy lantern telling them all the haunted happenings in the area. Later in the day, you’ll see the same guy in the same get up explaining the importance of some John S house. I don’t know, I tune them out typically. Can’t even enjoy a bite to eat half the time. What makes you think I want to drop 20$ for a sandwich every day for lunch? If you want to spend your time listening to embellished stories of things that kinda happened or gawk at the fake monster statues in the windows, be my guest.

  
Friends say I’m too cynical, I say I’m realistic. “You’re being a buzzkill man,” “Oh, you just don’t enjoy the whimsy,” “Let people have their fun,” people tell me. Would you be saying the same thing if you had to work in a tourist trap too? Let me tell you about it. It blows.

  
Everyday, I have to walk through all the sketchy ass alley ways, navigating a city plan meant for cattle not people. Sometimes I get extra unlucky and gotta talk my way out of being harassed by one of the local meth heads asking for change I never have. Usually, so long as you stay in the busy parts of downtown Salem, you’ll be fine. I, unfortunately, do not work near the rest of the big tourist traps. The place I work at is a few side streets this way and tripping over cobblestone that way. Follow those instructions and you’ll end up at another one of those old cliche colonial houses. Painted all black, chimney in the middle, and a candle in each of the dusty glass pane windows. Massachusetts has houses like these all over the place so I can’t really blame the locals for generally having no idea this place even exists. By all means, it looks like the other houses on the street that I grew up on before I moved to my rickety apartment here. It doesn’t help that there's never a sign that even indicates there's a store in there. Just an old, creaky house on one of the many blocks of Salem.

  
As if on cue, the door unlocks at 11 am on the dot. It's quite the parlor trick I must say. It’ll never unlock a second sooner. I always assume it's because my boss doesn’t want to pay me a cent more than she has too. I clock in to the sound of an old cow bell hitting the door.

  
“Morning everybody.” I say slightly sluggish. I was never a morning or afternoon person.

  
I was met with the usual resounding silence. You gotta entertain yourself somehow when you’re the sole employee. Besides, who wants to fuck with a store filled to the brim with haunted objects and arcana older than your grandparents. It took months to get the pilgrim ghost out of my apartment the last time I tried too. Although interesting to hear what the mayflower trip was like, it becomes less entertaining hearing a roommate who can’t pay rent scream witchcraft every time you turn a projector or lamp on. I would rather be called a heretic by one of those goth girls around here than some semi-translucent prude named Giles. 

  
Anyways, I’m getting off topic. While most college grads my age are sorting paperwork, my main job is essentially house sitting for my boss. Make sure the brooms are tied down, feed the spiders, adjust the eyes of the old dolls when they go cross eyed, the typical stuff really. It was a bit uncomfortable to squeeze newt juices into a vial when you're fresh out of college, but now I can’t really complain about it when it keeps the lights on. If wrangling a cat to get it to turn back to wood means I got enough pocket change to pay for a pre roll, then I’m wrangling a wooden cat. I’m not joking when I say Salem charges exorbitant amounts of money for your basic human necessities.

  
The store itself probably is what you imagine an oddities and curiosity shop to look like. It’s two floors of claustrophobic pine shelves arranged in a way similar to libraries normally. Though I wouldn’t recommend coming around Walpurgisnacht. The shop becomes a bit of an MC Escher painting the week of. I bet you can imagine how much fun it is to run a store when it takes 30 minutes to loop through each aisle forgetting which way is up or down. The bottom floor is filled to the brim with things that would typically attract an unsuspecting visitor. Taxidermies of animals and insects alike, a supposed real witches’ cauldron, liquid specimens in jars, dolls from across different decades, tarot cards, an apothecary arrangement behind the sales counter, and the oh so annoying brooms. Everything here basically looks artisan made. Although I hate working a tourist trap, I can’t argue that the dim, warm glow from the candles and stained glass tiffany lamps is quite comforting. From the tassel rugs to the tin ceiling tiles between the dark oak support beams in the ceiling, Mrs. Boss Lady really knows how to create an energy that makes people never want to leave.

  
Upstairs people often miss. It's a door off to the side with an ornate door handle. Sometimes it's propped open, sometimes it's not. I’m pretty sure I’m supposed to clarify it's not an employees only section, but I would rather clean up one floor instead of two. All the items that would actually be worth a collector’s time are kept up on the second floor. Under the sales counter, there's a couple tattered journals keeping track of sales and “Incidents.” Apparently, before I was hired, there was a bad theft problem. Something about a grimoire, toads, and that fountain downtown being flooded with toad human spawn? So now all the actual arcana is kept upstairs sealed in with chalk on the stair’s door. Old spell books, runic translation guides, jars of eyes that can see the future, gold and silver bullets, exotic animal bones, premade sigils, all the crazy things live up in the dark. I’m pretty sure there’s the real Dybbuk box too but I choose to leave the demons be. It really is another world up there though. One minute I’m running the counter and the next I catch myself staring at the stars through the roof. By the time I realize it, the stars dissipate and the room returns to its dark off purple tone. I usually toss my stock of joints after it happens on my shift. They probably got hexed again and I would need to drop a paycheck on getting fresh ones.

  
Most days are awfully slow. Waiting out the clock while polishing the pine countertops. Sometimes it feels like the rings of the wood are staring back at me, so it kills time to stare back. By the time the whispers of the ancient woods call my name, I know my staring break is over and I got to make sure one of the brooms didn’t get out again. Really the only entertaining thing that happens are the tourists. Stupid, brash, and loud tourists. They are the only ones that will ever come in because they would be the only people willing to walk through the brick maze to get here. The local graveyards are just an extra fun gimmick in-between the walk out here.

  
“Oh my goodness! I told you it wasn’t that far!” said a vaguely shrill voice.

  
“I can’t believe you were willing to risk breaking into someone’s house for the chance of a gift shop Brit.” said another woman with far less enthusiasm.

  
“I said I was going to visit every store here Jennifer.”

  
“Please don’t use my full name like that…”

  
The two women wandered the store chatting in an indistinct accent. Certainly not the havah’d yahd accent I’ve heard a million times but not quite the west coast accents I typically hear from people out of state. The two were quite the duo though. The taller brunette begrudgingly followed along with whatever the yippy blonde would say. Haven’t seen this kind of dynamic since high school. Makes it all the more noticeable seeing two grown women with cheap witch hats acting that way.

  
“Jenna! Jenna! Jenna look at the jackalope! He’s adorable, get a picture quick!”

  
“No photos of the animals please. They don’t like cameras.” I said while restocking the jars of herbs and dried florals behind the counter.

  
“Aww that’s cute! Don’t worry, I'm really good with animals. I’m THE cat whisperer. I'm sure a deer rabbit isn’t much different. Oh Jenna! Wouldn’t it be silly if I pretended to kiss it? What if it’s like my furry prince charming I have to kiss to save?”

  
“I really don’t know brit.” The brunette said getting sheepish.

  
“I’d highly advise against it. He really doesn’t like having his photo taken” I said more sternly.

  
The blonde huffed. Her short stature and naive pouting made her seem childish. Hard to take seriously. Hard to really care about much for minimum wage. A few quiet, petty remarks from her left a sour taste in my mouth. I gave her my warning so you can’t say I didn’t try to prevent what happened next.

  
The two wandered the store making small talk about the other items. How one doll looked like Annabelle and if a straw broom would be efficient for cleaning out a garage. Typical banter I’d hear week by week. I kept my eye on the pair best I could while managing my daily tasks. At some point while returning to the herbs and flowers behind me, I heard it.

  
*Click-click*

  
The distinct sound of a camera shutter. An auditory signing of a forever binding contract. Not a moment later, a quiet clank fell as the front door locked. A clank I only seemed to notice to my displeasure.

  
“Awww I look so cute in this! Look at his button nose! I should put it on a magnet and give it to my mom!”

  
“Maybe not Brit. You don’t want to give your mom a cursed photo or something.”

  
“Jenna, you're so funny! It’s okay, it's not haunted. See? I don’t have red eyes here. Officially not haunted.” the blonde retorted.

  
“I don’t think that's how that works-”

  
The brunette paused. She had grabbed the front door as they chatted on their way out, yet seemed to struggle with the handle. It firmly sat stuck, didn’t turn or wiggle in the slightest. Using both hands, she began tugging and turning. She put her foot against the door and wrestled the knob to no avail. She left a dusty shoe print right next to the handle. How kind of her.

  
“It’s a heavy door.” I said watching over at the two girls.

  
Their gaze met mine with a deadpan, annoyed stare. I thought they would appreciate some humor to lighten the mood but I guess not everyone is into my sense of humor. The two girls began plotting again, followed by the blonde hitting the door with her shoulder. The results remain the same.

  
“Hey! Can you open this door for us?” The brunette said to me.

  
“No can do.”

  
“What?”

  
"No can do."

  
“No, we heard you the first time. What do you mean no can do?”

  
“I mean there's nothing I can do about it. I don’t own the keys.”

  
“But you’re the only one here? How do you not have keys here?”

  
“I just work here ma’am. I don’t decide how the business is ran. I warned you two not to take a photo with our jackalope, but you guys did it anyway. You two broke store rules.”

  
“And what?! You keep us stuck here?! This is like. A kidnapping hostage thing now!” The blonde interjected.

  
“Store policy ma’am. I follow the store rules.”

  
I think that last comment got under the blonde’s skin or something. Or maybe it’s the instinct to lash out when you feel like a cornered animal. Whatever it was, she got red in the face. She wrestled the white pleather bag from the taller brunette and pulled out one of their phones. Who it belonged to, I would never know. The blonde hurled a flurry of expletives and insults at me fishing for some kind of response while trying to unlock the phone. She lifted up the phone to record me, the phone case covered in charms and rhinestones. I watched her tap the phone screen to record and-

  
***BANG***

  
The noise ripped through the dusty air of the shop. I flinched, throwing my hands up over my ears in a vain attempt to lessen the sound. It came and went in a moment, as the ringing in my ear lingered long after. I looked back up to process what just happened. A horrified brunette woman with a cheap witch hat stood behind a short blonde woman with a noticeable bloody hole between the eyes. The blonde fell to the floor with a hard thud as her now dead legs buckled under the weight of her corpse. The brunette’s outfit and hat already was ruined by the forward splatter from the exit wound. She screamed till her voice became hoarse.

  
“OH MY GOD. *OH MY GOD*!”

  
She desperately tried searching for any words to say between her shrieking. I felt bad for her. Seeing her friend get shot like that. I quietly left the counter to try and help comfort her, being in a customer service position and all. Her gaze was so focused on her friend’s dead body, she didn’t notice me walking up.

  
“Hey uh-”

  
A further scream, a slap, followed by jumping back from me. This is the one part of the job I always seemed to suck at.

  
“WHAT DID YOU DO? YOU SHOT HER? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?” she shouted.

  
“I didn’t shoot her!” I said defensively, throwing my hands up.

  
“SHE’S BEEN SHOT AT! LOOK AT HER!”

  
Realizing this would be a fruitless effort, I walked to the body and rolled her over to her back using the heel of my boot. The side effects already started to kick in. As the corpse fell onto its back, her head wobbled a bit more than usual on the impact. Puffs of stuffing fell out from her mouth and stuck to the shallow pool of blood under her head. Originally, one could see right through the gunshot after the initial shot. Now something foamy inside of her blocks the gap. Her skin looked tougher, slightly waxy. And her still open eyes seemed glassier than they were before.

  
“That’s a buckshot wound. Only a shotgun could-”

  
“LIAR! SHE WAS RECORDING IT! WHERE’S THE PHONE?”

  
Before I could grab the phone and stop the recording for her, she reached under me and grabbed it from beneath my feet. I almost stepped on it, not realizing where it had fallen. She stood up rambling about proof for the cops. Before she could finish her sentence, a second loud bang ripped through the store again. This time, the ringing was much louder in my ears after.

  
Following the blonde’s lead, she got herself shot between the eyes as well. Her body fell to the floor with a soft thud on top of the other. The sudden movement knocked the now taxidermized head out from the collar of the blonde’s shirt. It awkwardly rolled until it landed on its side a few inches away from the bodies. All that needed to be done now was for someone to mount the trophy kill.

  
The store fell to its usual silence again. I put my head in my hands, inhaled deeply and let a long sigh out. Some vague attempt at mentally preparing myself for another deep clean shift. You might find it hard to believe but the first time something like this happened, I freaked out and hid under the counter. I swore that if I hid there when the cops would inevitably come to the reports of gunshots, maybe I could get away with saying it was a robbery gone bad and I just hid. The only security cameras this place even has are the arguably sentient eyeballs and liquid specimens in jars. So I sat there. Waited and waited spiraling deeper and deeper into how I’d survive prison if they convicted me on a trophy animal’s ghost revenge murder. But no one came. My shift came to an end. The old antique clock struck 9 PM and yet no one came for hours after the gunshots. I packed my things, planning on ditching the job and never coming back for another shift. That was until the door remained locked. It only ever locked again after I had clocked out of my shift. I sat there and realized; I wasn’t getting out until I took care of the bodies.

  
Now it's become a usual routine. Not just haunted trophy taxidermy clean up but all sorts of wicked ways to go. Thankfully, I took a class in forensic clean up for my science credit. I at least never had to worry about how to clean up a dead body, or what remained of one. Frankly, after the first five incidents, it became a matter of when I’d be done cleaning up. With the two girls? I think it was about 3 hours if I remembered it all correctly. They just had to fall on the fancy carpets. The fibers in those things are so dense, it makes it hard to scrub all the blood out sometimes. Once the side effects fully set in for the both of them, I placed their heads under the counter for my boss to take care of next time she’s in. Just as soon as I placed their heads there, the front door’s lock clanked open. I was free to clock out.

  
A few days later, I went to go check the upstairs stock. Turns out: we got a brand new stock of witch trophies and monkey paws.

  
Working at a real tourist trap sucks. It's a never ending cycle of cleaning, stocking, exorcisms, possessions, summoning and rude customers. With a useless degree and expensive New England rent, beggars can’t be choosers I guess. Someone at sometime mentioned that I should write down my thoughts and feelings given that I tend to have a lot of thoughts on things. I think they were just trying to be polite and tell me to stop complaining. Regardless of the motive, I figure I should write down some of my work horror stories. Like the ones people post about that I read before bed. Maybe I’ll write about the other stories at a later date. I have to wrap this one up because a new customer just came in. Maybe he’ll be the first to leave with something from my boss’s tourist trap.
