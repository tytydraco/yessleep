You know, I am not the nicest guy, but I thought if I minded my own business, other people would do the same. Bullshit. 

I lived in a small city near a tourist trap, attracting thousands of them each year. They were good business, ready to waste too much money on cheap trash. Not just for the shops set up but also for every sleazeball, wanting to scam some poor bastard. 

I wasn't one of them, but I loved watching the shit show. It never made much sense to me why anybody wanted to go on vacation here. I don't want to overshare, so neither of you weirdos can locate me based on a description of grass or whatever. We had some charming sights and decent nature, but nothing worth showing up in person. And don't get me started on what a hustle a simple trip can be.  

I've yet to see one family not on the edge of a messy divorce when coming through. Crying kids, constant fighting, no one enjoying themselves. I knew how that felt like from a kid’s perspective, making it even funnier to watch somebody else going through it. 

A girl I liked had rejected me in not the nicest way, so I was in a rather bitchy mood. The only thing I was interested in now was watching somebody else have a worse time than me. So, I parked my ass on a bench nearby a popular gas station and enjoyed the show. I bought some overpriced ice and put on my douchiest sunglasses, so no one could see where I was looking. 

I caught some good ones. A family with three kids. All around 8 to 13 years old. It was perfect. But as they drove off under the wife's bitching, a car parked next to me. It wasn't illegal to park where they did, but it was a bit odd. I mean, it was right in front of the benches, nowhere near the usual parking area. 

As I tried my best to ignore the car, a guy got out. He looked nothing special. Similar sunglasses, longer blond hair, a leather jacket. It seemed like he tried a bit too hard to look cool, but hey, who am I to judge, I thought. He had sat on the front passenger seat, putting his arms on the car's roof, resting his head on his hands. 

“Hey, buddy,” he said, clearly talking to me. “Could you help us out, please?” 

I groaned under my breath. Tourists loved to ask you for directions or other dumb shit when they thought you were from around here. Nothing wrong with that, but, like I said, I'm a bit of an asshole, and today I was a rather huge one.  

“What?” I said. I didn't even try to keep the irritation out of my voice.  

My rudeness didn’t seem to bother him at all. “Me and my friends aren't from around here, and I think we are a bit lost?” 

His friends didn't even glimpse at me. They all shared the same wardrobe by the looks of it. Massive sunglasses on their faces, leather jackets, and the same white T-shirts. They stared right ahead but not focusing on something in particular. Something was off. They were clearly tense. 

This should have been my sign to fuck right outta there, but in my endless wisdom I thought they had argued for the last ten minutes, the tension a product of it. And hey, wasn't that what I came here to watch. 

“Damn, must suck to be you,” I replied. 

That made the guy pause, clearing his throat. “W… we are looking for Mrs. Apfel's Tea shop.” 

I tilted my head, acting like I was thinking. “Hmhm, no, never heard of it.” 

“Ehr … are you sure. We want to buy some apple tea with mint and lemon for my nephew's birthday,” he said, putting emphasizes on the last part. 

I put on a massive, shit-eating grin. “This sounds horribly gay. We don't have a shop like this here in town.” 

In my experience, there is nothing funnier than being an asshole to complete strangers that you will never see again. As long as you don't push too much, it's shocking what you can get away with. In particular with people that want to move on as fast as possible.  

Thanks to my many talents, I could sniff out any pussy that you could fuck with. That guy was super nice and polite. He would receive the message, take it, and fuck off. Or so I thought. 

Despite his sunglasses, I could see that he was frowning. “You're sure? It should be around here.” 

“Nope, it's not. I have no fucking idea what you are talking about.” 

“But we were told that it's here. Please, we came a long way. We’re from Idaho. ” 

I shrugged. “Okay.” 

“And… are really looking for this tea. You know, my nephew loves this tea and… 

“Damn, I care so much about this. Please, continue. I just want you to know how much I care.” 

Man, I was a bastard that day. I thought acting like a little shit would make this guy drive off, but he still stood there, whispering something to the driver. He looked up again, having a map in his hands, opening it up on the car's roof. 

“Sorry, man. I really don't want to bother you, but we asked somebody else from around here, and he said the shop should be here.” He pointed at his map. He waved me to come closer. “Take a look.” 

That made me pause. Who the fuck still uses a map? 

“Who the fuck still uses a map?” I asked. “Don't you guys have Google Maps?” 

“No, we are a bit old school. We like to…” 

As he was yapping, I got my phone out, googling the tea shop's name. “Sure, whatever,” I said, interrupting him. “I've looked it up. No fucking Mrs. Apfel tea shop here, okay. So… could you please leave me alone now?” 

The guy stepped away from the car, coming a bit closer to me, his hands in his pockets. He looked around him. “You sure?” 

“What?” 

“No tea shop here?” 

“I mean, there are some … but not what you asked.” 

He scratched his cheek. “That's weird.” 

“Okay.” 

“Because we came a really long way… 

“Woah, let me guess,” I said, holding up my hands like I was a medium. “From Idaho?” 

The guy laughed at that, clearly faking it. “Man, you're funny. I'm John,” he said, pointing at his chest. 

“Oh, now that's something. I'm also John,” I lied. 

He still had his finger at his chest. “John Smith.” 

“Damn, I'm also John Smith. What a fucking coincidence.” 

“Y… yeah, funny world,” he said. He was thinking for what to say next, being only a few steps away from me.  

John didn't look like a creep or psycho. Honestly, he was quite decent looking. But man, he started to freak me out. There is something so weird about someone not getting the message, ignoring all social clues. It might be a shocker to you guys, but I wasn't nice to him. I didn't want to talk to him. All I wanted was to be an ass, and watch him drive off, saying nasty things about me to his friends. 

But no, here he stood, glancing around.  

“Hey, it was great meeting another John Smith, but I’m terribly busy right now.” I pointed at the melting ice in my hand 

“Hey, okay,” he finally said. “I wasn't honest with you. I’m not looking for a tea shop.” 

“I don't know where you can buy drugs,” I said.  

“Oh, no. Nonono. We're not interested in that. We're here for something else.” 

“Ah, okay.” 

We stared at each other, John waiting for me to ask any question. After not receiving anything, he cleared his throat again. “W… we, well, our boss is looking for something. And, of course, he ordered us around to…” 

“What's your job?” 

“What?” 

“What's your job?” 

 I think he blinked at me behind his sunglasses, his hands twitching in his jacket. “We repair cars.” 

“Okay.” 

“And our boss send us to get something.” 

“Under the disguise of asking for a tea shop that doesn't exist?” 

“Y… yeah.” 

“Okay.” 

“And we are looking for a person who has some dirt on our boss. An affair, you know.” 

“What?” 

“Yeah, sh… she took some pictures of him after the act and wants to use it to blackmail him for money. Said, she would send them to his wife.” 

“What, under the name Mrs. Apfel?” 

“Yeah, you've heard of her?” 

“No,” I said. I was taken aback. “That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard!” 

“I know, I know,” John said, exhausted. I have to give it to him. He was a hell of an actor. “Believe me, I don't want to be here either. We have a picture of her, but we have no idea where she is. We just want to talk to her, give her the money, and be done with it. Could you just come to our car and take a look at the picture? That's all I'm asking.”  

“Nothing you say makes sense! Why don’t you know where this bitch if your boss was fucking her? And why do you need me to come to your car? If you want me to take a look at this picture, get it and bring it to me.” 

“Come on, man, please…” 

“What the fuck, no. I won't come to your car.” 

I'm a dude, so I never thought too much about a shady guy trying to kidnap me. But talking to John, I remembered the conversation I had with my sister. She explained to me who she feels nervous when a guy walks too close behind her. I called her paranoid. At that moment, I got her. 

“Please, I will pay you money…” 

“Okay, I'm outta here.” 

As I was about to get up, John got his right hand out of his pocket and opened his jacket, showing the gun that was hidden there.  

“Just get in the car already.” 

I stared at the gun, frozen in place. “Are you shitting me?” 

John shook his head, wanting to be done with this. “No, I'm not. Get in the car.” 

My heart bet a pace faster. I felt the first sweat run down my forehead before relief washed over me. “Oh my god, you guys are influencers, right? You're pranking me? That's why you try to look as unsuspicious as possible, right? Okay, where are the cameras?” 

“This is not a prank. I'm serious.” 

“Man, you're good. You're really good. I mean it. Please, you have to give me your channel's name. Are you guys famous? You…” 

John pulled out his gun, putting it inside his pocket, aiming it at me from there. “This is not a prank. We’re not some YouTubers. Get it in the car. Now.” 

It’s clear to me now that John kept his voice low and steady to not cause a scene. But this situation clearly drained him, too. Talking to a shithead like me was one of the last things he wanted to do. Getting my ass in his car was the last thing.  

He rubbed his eyes as I realized the shit I was in. “Come on, man, I... I didn’t mean to... I was just joking...” 

“Sure, whatever. Get in the car.” 

“I...” 

“I don’t care. Okay? I really don’t. I will not repeat myself again. Get in the car r. Now.” 

Unsure whether this was real, I rose from the bench. A knot had formed in my throat, hurting with every shallow breath I managed to get down. “M... my ice?” I asked, pointing at it. 

No idea why I asked. My nerves were going through it.  

John looked at it, and without any ill will, just pushed it out of my hand, letting it fall to the ground. “Come on now. Let’s get this over with,” he said, grabbing me by my shoulder, guiding me to the car. 

I twitched as he touched me. My gut reaction was to slap his hand away, but my gut also told me how this one would end. Though, I have to say, for a kidnapper, John was surprisingly chill. Probably the kindest abduction anyone has ever experienced. 

Didn’t prevent me from shitting myself, of course. Now I started to believe that John wasn’t fucking around. I imagine this is what it feels like to be in a car crash. Or moments before. Nah, that can’t be real. That’s something that happens to people on the TV. Or not to me, at least.  

“Please, I didn’t...” I begged again. Like it would magically change John’s mind this time. 

“I know,” he replied, shoving him into the car.  

One of the guys in the back seat had gotten out, so they could put me in the middle. Without any further notice, John took this seat again, and the car drove on. Not a word to me. I didn’t expect them to explain to me what was going on, but a few threats would have been normal, I guess.  

But nope. Nothing. Worse yet, while still tense, they weren’t nervous. John had been clumsy in his attempts to get me to their car, but he didn’t seem to be bothered by any of this. Annoyed, sure, but not concerned.  

To those guys, kidnapping a complete stranger was just another chore. Though, they didn’t strike me as hardened criminals. I had no doubt that John wasn’t the only one with a gun, but having one and shooting one are two different things. Perhaps it was my desperate hope that I wouldn’t end up dead that made me believe this.  

But, the fact that they hadn’t bothered to hide their faces from me sung a different tune.  

It took me a few minutes before I found my voice again. “W... where... a... are we go... going?” 

“You...,” John sighed, rubbing his eyes again. “Just shut up, will you? I’m not in a good mood right now.” 

I didn’t need to hear that twice. We sat in silence as the car drove on. In my head, I went through everything that led me to this, cursing like a sailor. I thought of the unlikeliness they would choose me from all the people there and of the sheer unfairness of it all. In general, I thought of me. What I didn’t think too much about was how to get out of this. 

I’m not the smartest guy. Not dumb, but also not that smart. Getting out of an abduction would take a bright mind, and at that moment my brain was liquefying under the stress. I could barely keep it together, just sitting there without throwing up into my lap turned out to be quite the challenge.  

But, bit by bit, I regained what you could call a half-functional mind. I glimpsed out of the window, searching for anybody I knew. Though, how I would get their attention without alarming John and his goonies, I had no idea. And while I recognized some faces, no one paid any attention to us. The two guys around me had me well hidden from every superficial glance.  

As this didn’t work out, I tried to decipher where we were heading. John’s buddy took a popular route through the city, driving at a slow pace. Those guys had guts or were just stupid. Or, they knew I was a massive pussy that wouldn’t try shit even when given the chance.  

So, this was my time in this fucking car. After ten minutes, we reached our destination. The car went to the outer rims of the city where most folk with families had houses. We didn’t stop there, but at one of the last houses still belonging to the city. That one had been under construction longer than I could remember. No idea who owned it, but they didn’t seem to be in any hurry to move in. Most other houses nearby were like this; so deep in renovations that they remained empty. 

“Okay,” John said, turning in his seat. “You’ll get out of this car with us, and you will follow everything we say, okay? Don’t try anything. It won’t work. Understood? Good, let’s go.” 

John’s nonchalant tone stood in harsh contrast to everything that had happened, but I nodded. Like a good puppy, I went with them inside the house. It was nothing to write home about. Tiny, in fact. Once inside, there was one corridor leading to some room I couldn’t see. One staircase led up to the second floor while another to the basement. 

And, of course, we took the one to the basement. You would think that the place where kidnappers would keep you had something sinister to it. But except for a few chairs and gardening equipment, it was largely empty. I was offered one, meaning they shoved me onto it and tied me up with some rope. I’ve seen the guy bound to a chair countless times in movies, but hell, you would never believe how panic inducing it is to experience it yourself. Being completely helpless, no way out of this, at the mercy of someone who had none.  

Or, in John’s case, appeared more dismissive about the entire ordeal. He thumbed in a number in his phone, going upstairs as he talked to someone. The rest of the gang waited with me for forty minutes. That’s my guess at least. I want to say forty years because that’s what it felt like. And, by the way, my only genius idea in those forty minutes was to legit piss myself to make my kidnapping as uncomfortable as possible for these guys. 

It didn’t come to that, as John stepped down the stairs with a new guy behind him. This one was interesting because he was so plain looking. A dude in his late forties. Already lost most of his hair but still had some at the sides. A nerdy looking glasses and an outfit that screamed soccer dad.  

At his arrival, the three sunshines that had spent so much quality time with me stopped their card game. They jumped to their legs, tense all over again. Like a soldier ready to salute. Despite his lacking appearance, our newcomer was their leader. With a wave of his hand he put his goon squad back to ease.  

“Okay, John,” he said, walking past John towards me, “we have to hurry and...”  

The leader stopped right in front of me, frowning. He tilted his head, moving up his glasses, so he could squint at me with his eyes. After doing so, he put the back on and turned to John. 

“Who is this guy?” 

John blinked. “What?” 

“Who is this?” the leader asked again, his voice having an irritated edge to it. 

“Boss, what do you mean? That’s the guy we were supposed to get.” 

The leader stood there for a moment, mouth open. “The guy you were supposed to get is Asian! Who the fuck is this?!” 

John mouthed something to himself, glimpsing at the driver.  

“I told you so, John,” the driver whispered. 

“B... but on the phone call y... you said...” 

“I said get a guy at the benches. He is Asian. He will act like he doesn’t know what’s going on until you say the phrase. Did you say the phrase?” 

“Yeah, I did. Mrs. Apfel’s Tea shop and stuff...” 

“Then why isn’t he here?!” 

It took John a moment to collect himself. “I... I’m sorry, boss. The reception was shit when you called. I thought you said a guy at the benches who’s going to act like...” 

“Why didn’t you call back then?!” the boss shouted, throwing up his hands.  

In retrospect, I can laugh a bit at it. I mean, you should have seen John’s face. But mine would have been better. 

“Do you know how long it took me to find him?” The boss asked. “Weeks! And then I had to convince him that we are serious about this and can be trusted. But apparently, we can’t be. We will never see him again! He is gone, John, gone.” 

John looked at the ground as the rest of the gang stood in awkward silence around their boss. The big man himself had pushed up his glasses again, massaging his face with one hand, the other on his hip. He talked to himself, too quiet for me to hear.  

John gathered himself before speaking again. “What should we do now?” 

The boss didn’t look at him, still rubbing his face. “He’s gone, John. I don’t know how we are...” 

“No,” John said, pointing at me, “with him?” 

That made everyone pause, all eyes on me. The boss scratched his chin, his finger moving over the stubbles there. “That’s a good question.” 

“Couldn’t we...” 

“We have to kill him,” the boss said, shrugging. 

“What?!” I blurted out. 

“B... but boss,” John said, his hands twitching, “isn’t that a bit extreme?” 

“John, he has seen our faces. We have to kill him.” 

Man, and I had thought that John was nonchalant. 

At that moment, I was openly crying, testing the ropes. “Please, I’m not gonna tell anybody!” I begged. “I will not say anything, I swear!” 

The boss sighed. “I’m sorry, kid. I know you didn’t want any of this, but it is what it is.” 

As the boss signaled for the driver to hand over his gun, John stepped forward. “Wait, boss. Couldn’t we still do it? But just with him instead?” 

“Are you mad, John? This isn’t going to work.” 

“Come one, boss, I fucked up...” 

“And you don’t want blood on your hands, sure. But... 

“You don’t want it either, boss. Come on, he looks just like your kid. Are you telling me you really want to shoot him?” 

The boss examined me with his eyes, calm and collected but tainted with some hesitation. “I don’t want to shoot anybody, John, but sometimes you’re left with no choice.” 

“But you still have one, right? Listen, boss, I fucked up. Whatever happens, I take full responsibility.” 

The boss sighed again, waving away the gun held out in front of him. “Whatever happens, it’s on you.” 

The boss took one of the chairs and placed it in front of me. The chair’s back direct towards me, he rested his arms on the back as he sat, his head on his arms. “Hey, buddy,” he said, his voice kind. He sounded like I was a kid in his soccer team, and he wanted to cheer me up after a less than stellar performance. “Say, what’s your name?” 

“M... Matty.” 

“Hi Matty. My name is Frank. These are my boys. There are working for me. I hope they haven’t been too rough with you? No? Great. So, as you might have guessed, my boy Johnny here, has made a big mistake. 

“We never intended for you to be here. It’s not your fault. You did nothing wrong. But you are here now. You have seen our faces and that’s not good,” he said. I was about to beg again, but he held up his hand before I could speak. “I know, I know. Don’t worry, Matty, we won’t harm you. You will get out of this, but you have to do something for us. 

“But before we can start, we have to take some safety precautions. Boys.” 

Frank’s boys swarmed over me, taking out my wallets and everything I had on me. Frank went through my wallet, checking my ID, taking a photo with his phone. 

“Okay, Matty, I know you already promised you won’t go to the authorities once we let you go, but we have to go through a few things, you know. Should you, and I know you won’t, but should you decide to contact anybody about us and what happened here, it will have consequences. 

“To be clear, neither the police, FBI, nor anybody else will find us, okay? It doesn’t matter who you get. They won’t find us. But we will learn that you spoke up.” 

Frank held up my ID. “And now we know who you are and where you live. And even if you get protections, it won’t matter, okay? I know, you would never do that, Matty, but I just want to be very open with you.  

“You have family, right? Friends? A girl? No. Oh, don’t worry. Also took some time for me, but now,” Frank held up his hand, showing his wedding ring, smiling. Fuck me, this, in a weird way, actually made me feel better about getting dumped. Despite everything, Frank had something so fatherly about him that you couldn’t help yourself but to listen and believe him.  

“Well, not important right now. Sorry. What I meant, you have people in your life. People that are important to you, right? Good. We all do. What would life be without them? If you go against us, you bring our people in danger, not just us. Again, the authorities wouldn’t succeed, but an attempt is an attempt. So, you know where I’m going with this. You’re a smart boy, Matty, so I won’t insult your intelligence.  

“But now you know for certain what will happen if you talk, right?” 

I nodded, breathing through my ceasing sobs. “Y... yeah, Frank.” 

Frank smiled, delighted at my cooperation. Hard to believe that he wanted a bullet in my head no five minutes ago. “Good to hear, Matty, good to hear. With this unfortunate business out of the way, we can go to the part that will earn you your freedom. Like you already know now, we didn’t intend you to be here.  

“I had a... business partner that was supposed to be here. But he is not. Water under the bridge for why. But he was supposed to do something very important for us. Something neither me nor my boys can do ourselves, unfortunately. Johnny here said that we could still try with you. 

“And before I explain to you what you are supposed to do, I have to make another thing clear. Don’t ask about what or why, okay? If you knew, we couldn’t let you go. All you need to hear, we do important work, okay? So important, in fact, that this is necessary. Do you understand, Matty?” 

I forced down my snot, the last tears running down my face. “Y... yeah.” 

“Ah, Matty, you are such a good kid. Your old folks have to be so proud. I wish my junior would be half as smart as you are. Don’t get me wrong. He is a good kid. I mean, he’s mine, so of course he is. But he can be so... mindless. You know?” 

Frank looked around his boys, all nodding in agreement. 

“Oh, I’m yapping again, aren’t I. You have to show me some patience, Matty. You know, once you get to my age, which you will, of course, you just talk and talk... Ah, I do it again.” 

Frank giggled to himself. How much of this was theater or genuine, I can’t say. But it helped in clearing the tension. 

Frank cleared his throat, growing somber. “Matty, what I will explain to you next will sound worse than it is, okay. Always remember, once you’re done, you can go. So, we will inject you with a substance that will temporarily turn you blind. It won’t last longer than ten to twenty minutes. Nothing to worry about. 

“Once this has happened, you will start to see things. Crazy things. You’re a good kid, Matty, so I would guess you haven’t taken anything, right? Well, it would be like you had. Doesn’t sound too bad, huh? So, you will see things, and we need you to explain them to us. After that, we will guide you because we need you to find us something. Or somebody, I should say. 

“Me and my boys are looking for two girls. Twins. Identical. Like I said, they can save lives, but we need to find them, and we can only do so with your help. And, I don’t want to put any pressure on you, but we are on a schedule, so we have to start now.” 

While Frank had succeeded in calming me down, my head turned to slop again after his explanation. To say this sounded strange doesn’t really describe it. Psychotic appears more appropriate, in my opinion at least. By the sounds of it, they wanted me to ingest LSD on steroids and watch what would happen. Like they did their best cosplay of some insane CIA agent. 

The driver went upstairs and reappeared shortly after with a black suitcase. Looked expensive. Frank opened it, and I could only catch glimpses. I can’t say what it was filled with only that it was black and was used to pad out the entire suitcase. It appeared a bit like plastic with four openings. Two larger one for two syringes and the other for two tiny glass containers. Like the suitcase they were transported with, they were filled with something black. 

The tops of the glass containers were made of rubber or something. Solid enough so nothing could get out, but easily pierceable for the syringes. Seeing Frank as he filled the syringes turned my body into one massive cramp. My skin tingled as if I were roasted above an open fire.  

Frank slapped his finger against the tip of the syringes, testing whether everything was fine. “So, Matty, the next part is going to sound scary, but I need you to trust me. You do trust me, right Matty?” 

I nodded. 

“I need you to sit perfectly still, yeah, because I have to inject you with this substance directly into your eyes.” 

“What?!” I screamed. 

I pressed myself against my chair as Frank took a step towards me, first syringe in hand. I rattled against the rope keeping me in place, trashing like an animal stuck in a bear trap. The sobs returned, and I struggled to breathe properly. All I could manage were hectic gasps. 

Frank’s boys held me down as I didn’t calm myself. Having their hands on arms and shoulders made things worse. I was yelling my lungs out at this point. No words, just guttural sounds that you will make if a needle creeps closer and closer to your eyeball. 

“Come on, Matty, don’t make it difficult for all of us. The stuff in here will go away, I promise. It will only form a temporary layer on top of your eyes. But only if you stop jerking around.” 

As his words failed to have the same effect this time, he grunted for John to help the other, seizing my head. As the syringe was only inches away from me, I stopped yelling, returning to begging. I can’t remember what I said, only that it didn’t work on either of them.  

Frank started with my left eye. I can still see it. Its sharp tip, droplets of black sticking to it. It came closer and closer until I felt this hot pain shot through my eye. “There we go,” Frank said. “We’re nearly done here.” 

I whimpered, gasping for air. Never have I ever seen something so close like the needle, scratching against my iris. And so I could see the black stuff being slowly pressed out of the syringe. But before I saw anything, a sudden pressure struck my eye. Faint at first, it grew to an unimaginable level in seconds. I feared that my entire eyeball would just explode. Perhaps this would have been a more pleasant experience than this. It’s difficult to convey how horrible this feeling was. Imagine an elephant’s entire weight put on your eye. 

Only after Frank injected me with all the syringe had contained did the pressure vanish. I nearly lost consciousness as he pulled the needle out. The pain was gone instantly, leaving nothing but a throbbing ache where it had pierced my eye. I managed a smile between my tears, relaxing in my kidnappers’ arms. 

This didn’t last long. The blackness was now in my eye. You know, I said I had never seen anything as close as the needle. Well, up to this point, this was correct. I could see the little particles of the black stuff with such clarity that it took my back. The black wasn’t one substance but tiny specks all amassing together, forming the illusion of one singular body.  

But as I studied them this up close, I saw what they really were. They moved, no, they swam inside my eyeballs. I could make out their little limbs they used to navigate themselves. They had no eyes or clear form to them, but they didn’t need them for me to realize that they were alive. 

“What the fuck?!” 

Frank prepared the second syringe. “It’s all good, Matty. They won’t hurt you. Just let it happen.” 

Whatever those black things were, they wasted no time in exploring their new home. As they did, their mass increased. I don’t know how, but they grew. Fast. At first, I thought they were getting fat by devouring the insides of my eyeball, but I felt no stinging sensation that would indicate those little devils from tearing into my eye. 

No, they just expanded. And with that, their features became even more clear. They were made of absolute black. No light would have been able to pierce through them. But they had no smooth surface. Their bodies undulating, always in motion. Furthermore, their skin, if you want to call them that, had a shocking resemblance to human skin. Have you ever seen a hardcore close up of a human face? Or an extreme realistic painting of human skin where every little notch is shown? That’s what their constant moving mass looked like. I think I even saw hair protruding out of their bodies like lashes.  

It didn’t take a minute before their growth had caused the vision in my left eye to go dark. Like a blanket of utter blackness thrown over my left side, not allowing anything through. 

Frank gestured something that I couldn’t clearly see, watched me, and then nodded with a satisfied smile. “It has worked. Thanks, Matthew.” 

I frowned, turning my head to my left to see what he meant. The driver, Matthew, had stood on my blind side, holding a loaded gun to my head. Perhaps I should have had a stronger reaction to that, but the syringe business made anything else look rather tame. 

“So,” Frank said, holding up the second needle. “Let’s get the right side done.” 

I will spare you of the details. But I will say knowing what was to come didn’t help me remain calm. Again, Johnny and the rest had to hold me down. My resistance was nothing compared to their combined strength.  

Two minutes later, I was blind.
