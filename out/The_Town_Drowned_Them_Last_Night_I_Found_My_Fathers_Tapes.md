The first time I saw Lake Hollow, I was six years old. My father held my hand too tight as we stood on the shore, watching the water ripple black under the moon. “Remember, Clara,” he said, his voice trembling. “Never swim here. Not even your toes.”  

Twenty years later, I’m standing in the same spot, holding his suicide note.  

*“They’re in the water. They’re hungry again. Forgive me.”*

Dad’s cabin reeked of mildew and regret. I hadn’t been back since Mom vanished during a “camping trip” when I was twelve. The police found her backpack at the lake’s edge, filled with smooth stones and a single pearl earring. Dad insisted she’d left us. Now, sorting through his things, I found the tapes.  

VHS, labeled in his shaky script: *“Protocol”* followed by dates spanning decades.  

The first one was dated two weeks after Mom disappeared.

**TAPE 1: 10/23/2004**  

Static, then Dad’s face fills the screen. He’s younger, eyes bloodshot. Behind him, the lake glistens like oil.  

“*It works,*” he whispers. “*Dr. Varga said it would. The drownings… they have to be willing. Or at least, family.*”  

The camera pans to the shore. A woman in a yellow sundress stands ankle-deep, her back to the lens. Mom.  

“*Mara, please,*” Dad pleads off-screen. “*It’s the only way to stop it.*”  

Mom turns. Her eyes are gone. Hollow sockets drip black sludge. She smiles.  

“*I’ll do it for Clara,*” she says, and walks deeper until the water swallows her.  

Dad sobs. The tape ends.

**TAPE 7: 09/14/2023**  

Dad, older, gaunt. The cabin’s walls are covered in maps and newspaper clippings: *“Lake Hollow’s 15th Drowning This Summer!”*  

“*The Bargain is failing,*” he mutters. “*Varga warned us. One soul every five years to keep it sleeping. But the drownings… they’re not enough anymore. It wants more.*”  

He holds up a photo. A little girl with pigtails—Emily Cartwright, missing since August.  

“*I tried to tell her parents. They called me a monster. But they don’t understand. If we don’t feed it, the whole town…*”  

A knock off-screen. Dad pales.  

“*It’s here.*”  

The camera captures the window. Something presses against the glass—a human face, bloated and fish-belly white, lips peeled back from needle teeth. Mom’s pearl earring glints in its tangled hair.  

The tape cuts to static.

**Last Night**  

I played the final tape. Date: yesterday.  

Dad sits slumped, a revolver in his lap. The cabin walls are now bare, except for a child’s drawing taped to the fireplace. My drawing. A stick-figure family by a lake.  

“*Clara,*” he says, weeping. “*I tried to spare you. But it’s in the blood. Your mother… she wasn’t the first. My father drowned my sister here in ‘68. Her sacrifice bought us thirty years. Then your mother bought twenty. But you—*”  

He grips the gun.  

“*It wants you next. It’s been waiting. And I can’t… I can’t do it.*”  

He raises the revolver. The shot rings out. The camera falls, showing his body crumpled on the floor.  

Then, movement.  

The cabin door creaks open. Wet footprints trail toward the camera. A hand—slick with algae, fingers too long—reaches down.  

The screen goes dark.

**Now**  

The townsfolk avoid me. Old Mrs. Cartwright spat at my feet this morning. “*Should’ve been you,*” she hissed.  

At the lake, I found Dad’s research. Dr. Varga’s notes from 1932:  

*“The entity beneath Lake Hollow requires kinship. A blood sacrifice to sustain the Bargain. Refuse, and it will rise. The water will claim every soul in Hollow Creek, then spread. No cure. No mercy.*”  

A list follows. Names. Dates.  

My aunt Lucy. 1968.  

Mom. 2004.  

Emily Cartwright. 2023.  

And my name, underlined.

**Tonight**  

The lake is singing.  

It sounds like Mom. Like her lullabies. I’m standing where she stood, the water lapping at my toes. It’s warm. Alive.  

Dad’s revolver is heavy in my hand. But the Bargain requires willingness.  

Behind me, the town sleeps. Ignorant. *Innocent*.  

The water stirs. Shapes glide beneath the surface—pale, grasping things with Mom’s eyes and Emily’s pigtails.  

I step deeper.  

“*Clara,*” the lake sighs.  

I drop the gun.

**Epilogue**  

Hollow Creek Gazette, 10/31/2023:  

*“Mystery Solved! Local Woman’s Body Recovered from Lake Hollow. Tragic Suicide Ends String of Drownings.”*  

The article doesn’t mention the fingerprints on her arms—small, child-sized, pressing *up* from beneath her skin.  

Nor does it report that the lake… is finally still.
