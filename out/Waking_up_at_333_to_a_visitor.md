I'm new to reddit so I don't know if I'm doing this right or if anyones going to read this but I feel like I need to share this because i've been sleepless for two years now since this event. (p.s. if there's any spelling mistakes or the sentences don't make sense its because I'm dyslexic)

For back ground knowledge I was 17 at the time and I live in a house with my family (two sisters, mom, dad and four dogs) the original part of my house is really old, however in 2003 my mom and dad had an extension on the house that's  where my bedroom and sisters bedroom is located which is attached by a corridor. so I don't believe it was a ghost.

for as long as I can remember id get really scared walking round my house at night or Id hate staying at home alone due to it just having an eerie feeling like a mans broke into my house . Also having four dogs you would think I would feel a sense of protection.

On this night, I went to bed around my usual time of 10-11pm. But through the night I suddenly woke up and had a sense of danger like I was being watched but my room was pitch black so I couldn't even see if I was . I then checked my phone to see the time was 3:33am and I promptly remember that and I don't know why. the light from me turning on my phone lit up my room so I could see.. my heart dropped. behind my bed to the right  there was this man/black figure emerging from one of my posters peering at me with half his body still in the wall. this man had no significant facial features and I since getting away so quick I couldn't tell you was this being definitely looked like. on my mothers life this was genuinely real or maybe it was my first time having sleep paralysis.

I never ran so quick in my life. I ran down the corridor to the nearest room ,my sisters bedroom, to get in her bed forgetting she's just got rid of her bed frame so the mattress was on the floor. i was scared to not wake her as she's facing the other way and for some reason I thought if she turned over to look at me it would be someone else. As the night went on I started hearing this woman painfully screaming from outside. However I was just thinking of many different theories for it. Such as, I live on a main road so it might just be people waling by drunk/joking, as I didn't want to think I was in a real life horror movie. More so, due to having so many dogs I was surprised they weren't barking at these horrific screams outside when they usually bark at a sight of a person walking outside my house.

I was restless, I couldn't sleep that night after that. All I can remember doing is preying to be safe and to go to sleep as I thought I was in genuine danger. Ever since ive been sleeping in my sisters bedrooms and downstairs because of how petrefided I was. getting dressed in the mornings in my room even scared the life out of me. More so, ive took down all my posters on my walls and threw away the one he crept out. 

That morning, I questioned everyone in my house about the screaming outside that went on for hours, but they just laughed and I was too embarrassed to tell them about seeing that figure in my room and them brushing it off as me seeing "ghosts". Nothing weird has happed since the event and a month ago ive started sleeping in my room again. However I did also search up "what waking up at 3:33 am means" on google and it creeped me outa bit but does make sense.

below I'm gonna share photos of the posters on my wall it was the pink Tyler the create Igor one he came out of. also  what google said when I searched the time up.
