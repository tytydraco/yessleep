It first came to my attention about a month ago. 

My girlfriend had confronted me after I got off work, her eyes ablaze with accusations.

“Is this you? When did you make this? And what’s the deal with your name?” she said, shoving her phone into my face.

On her phone, was the profile of a man who looked completely identical to me, right down to the little mole on my neck. For a moment, I thought it was me. Someone must have taken photos from my account and made a fake one to mess with me. 

However, none of the photos were ones I recognized. The profile included pictures of this man wearing suits and ties, shaking the hands of important-looking businessmen, and sitting at bars with people I’ve never seen before. 

The only difference between us was his name, Simon Simon. 

I snatched the phone from my girlfriend’s hands and scrolled in disbelief. 

“Holy shit! He looks just like me!”

“You’re telling me this isn’t you?” Her tone was unconvinced.

“Jesus, I thought it was me too.” I laughed.

I shrugged the account off at the time. Having a doppelganger isn’t unheard of, but the events that occurred over the month following this incident are what brought me here to ask you guys, who is Simon Simon?

–

About a week after discovering the account, I got a text from my mom that read, “What was your deal earlier?” 

I racked my brain for a moment, trying to think of any incident I had with her, but to no avail.

“What?” I responded.  

“At the store today.”

I stared at the text in confusion. 

“Uh, I haven’t been to the store today.”

Another ding emitted a few minutes later, “You shouldn’t treat your mother like that.” 

I scoffed and decided that calling her would be the easiest way to clear the air. She picked up after the second ring. 

“Yes?” Her voice came through the line quietly but I could tell she was upset. 

“I haven’t been to the store all day, Mom.”

I heard a soft sigh on the other line.

“Yeah, maybe it wasn’t you.” She replied, “Sorry, I should’ve figured that, I’ve never seen you wearing a suit before.”

“What do you mean?” 

“There was a man who looked just like you at the store wearing a suit. I tried to talk to him because I seriously thought it was you but he just shoved right past me.” 

“Oh!” I laughed, “Mom you won’t believe what-”

Before I could finish, a series of firm knocks erupted from the front door. I glanced over my shoulder. 

“I’ll call you back, Mom,” 

I hung up and slid the phone into my pocket as another series of knocks, louder and more insistent than the first, rang out. 

“Coming!” I shouted before cautiously approaching the door. Another loud, singular knock shook the frame and echoed through the house. I leaned against the door and peeked out the peephole, half expecting to see myself standing on the other side. Instead, there stood two men dressed in tacky Hawaiian shirts, whose bright colors and patterns clashed with the seriousness of the bulletproof vests they had on top. The taller of the two stood with his arms crossed, a pair of sports sunglasses hugged his bald head as he muttered something under his breath. The shorter of the men stood farther back, snickering, and had a video camera trained at the door. 

“Can I help you?” I shouted through the door, still watching through the peephole. 

“Come outside, Mike. Just wanna talk,” The tall man shouted. 

“H-how do you know my name?” 

“Does Clarissa ring a bell?” The tall man said, turning around and whispering something to his buddy. 

“Uh…no?” 

He sighed and shook his head, “OK, so, you can come outside and talk to us, or we can call the police. Which will it be?”

Against my better judgment, I decided to open the door.  

–

“There he is!” The short man pointed his camera at me with a crooked smile.

“Thanks for your cooperation, Micheal.” The tall man said. 

“What the hell is going on?” I shouted, my voice cracked with anger and a little fear, “Give me one 
good reason I shouldn’t call the police on YOU!” 

“We aren’t the ones trying to solicit a thirteen-year-old for sex on Facebook, Mike,” the short man sneered. 

“EXCUSE ME?” I felt heat race through my skin, flushing it red with anger and a little fear. “What the fuck are you talking about?” 

“Clarissa was me the whole time, bud,” The tall man laughed and held up a yellow binder with my name on it. “Got all the messages here so let's skip the denial, K?.” 

“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” I said coldly.

The tall man sighed again, his brow furrowing as he flipped open the binder. 

“So…” He paused as he flipped through the pages before finally settling on one, “This isn’t you?” 

He flipped the book around and I was greeted with a fully nude figure standing in front of a mirror. I gasped and was about to look away, but the figure's face caught my eye. It looked just like me.

I attempted to snatch the binder, but the tall man ripped it away. “Ah, ah, ahh,” He mocked, “Not the first time someone tried taking our evidence.” 

“I-I’m not trying to, I didn’t, I- '' I stuttered, finally catching my words and screaming, “That’s not me!” 

The shorter man laughed again, adjusting the camera to capture my reaction. “You’re in deep shit here, Micheal.” 

“July 1st, 10:56 P.M., you said you couldn’t wait to… impregnate this child?” The tall man said, shaking his head while flipping through the pages. “June 30th, 11:05: I’m gonna turn you into my own personal slut. The 29th: You’re gonna ca-” 

“ENOUGH!” I cried while snatching my phone from my pocket and opening Facebook. “Look, I know I sound like I’m lying, but I have this… this doppelganger… He looks exactly like me so I don’t blame you guys for-” 

“Hah!” The short man scoffed, “That’s a new one!”

“You really expect us to believe that shit?” The tall man chortled alongside him, “We’ve heard all the excuses.”

I ignored them, quickly typing out “Simon Simon” into the search bar. No results. I swore under my breath and began typing out another variation of the name before the tall man reared back his hand and slapped me across the face. 

“What the fuck!” I screamed, pain searing across my face.

“Put that phone away, bitch!” The tall man barked.

“Get the fuck off my porch!” I shouted, attempting to assert any form of dominance. Instead, the two men laughed again.

“Or what pussy?” The tall man spat before reaching for something behind his back. Before I could find out what it was, I retreated into my house, slamming the door shut and quickly locking the deadbolt. I heard the men’s muffled curses and threats on the other side, followed by a hard thump that shook the doorframe. 

I leaned against the door, its cool surface temporarily soothing my pounding heart. Adrenaline surged through me as I scanned the area for something, anything to defend myself with. The men’s threats grew louder and more violent. I peered out the peephole and watched them pace back and forth through my yard. I pulled out my phone and, with trembling fingers, punched in 9-1-1. I stared at the numbers, contemplating the fact that the men were gonna switch the story around and get me into trouble. The thought paralyzed me momentarily, my thumb hovering over the call button, when suddenly a deafening roar came from outside. 

I sprang up and peered outside to see a black muscle car come to a screeching halt outside my house. The engine purred with a deep, resonant rumble that reverberated through the still night air, shaking the ground beneath me. The two men shouted something before they raced towards the car and hopped into the back. I sat, shaking against the door, listening as the car screamed to life, tearing down the road with an explosion of noise and disappearing into the night. 

–

The days following my visit from the men were quiet. No police visits, no further investigations, nothing. Just a thick, uneasy calm that smothered my life. I spent a lot of my freetime following the incident searching for the Simon Simon account. Anxiety gnawed at me, keeping me motivated to find any evidence that the account existed. I didn’t tell my girlfriend about the men, I didn’t know how to. And obviously I didn’t want her to think I was some creep. Simon’s account was gone, don’t know what happened to it, but I hoped it meant that nothing like this would happen again. 

And then I found him. 

–

I was just beginning to move on from the whole thing. What else was I supposed to do? It seemed like the account had been wiped off the face of the Earth. I wrote it off as some unexplainable event and just tried to forget about it. But I found the bastard. I found him. 

I was taking an evening walk, something I often do to clear my head, when I rounded a corner and came across a man and a young girl on the other side of the street. The man was on one knee with his back to me. He was muttering something to the girl, his voice low but smooth. She giggled and nodded at whatever he said, her ponytail bobbing enthusiastically. 

I approached slowly, intending to merely slink past them, but as I moved closer, something about this man felt oddly familiar. His posture, his hair, his…voice. 

“Don’t worry, they won’t even notice you’re gone,” The man whispered excitedly. “A new puppy will be the perfect surprise for your parents. I have some more right around the corner in my car, you can take your pick!” 

I stopped in my tracks, his words echoing in my head. No, this wasn’t right.

The little girl looked around reluctantly before her eyes locked with mine. Her expression changed from reluctance to confusion as she squinted her eyes at me. The man continued to mutter things to her, his words muffled by the sound of rushing blood in my ears.  

At that moment, I felt a surge of recognition so profound it was almost nauseating. It wasn’t just the voice or the posture, it was the way she glanced from me to him, the way her expression changed, the way I felt that the man knew I was there. His features remained obscured, concealed by the angle of his body and the distance that separated us, but I knew, with a gut-wrenching certainty, that this was Simon Simon.

I weighed my options, my breath shallow and ragged. Time felt like it slowed down to a torturous crawl. The distant hum of traffic faded into the background, leaving only the palpable tension that hung thick and heavy in the air. Every detail of the scene etched itself into my mind—the faint scent of freshly cut grass, the gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze, the way the sun bathed the street in a golden, almost dreamlike light. 

Simon suddenly straightened up, turning his head slightly in my direction but still shielded from full view. His movements were fluid and confident, a stark contrast to my trembling uncertainty. The child, sensing the tension between us, took a tentative step back, her eyes darting nervously between us. He muttered something once more to the girl, something that sent her sprinting in the other direction. 

Slowly, Simon twisted around to face me, his blue eyes meeting with mine with such intensity that I felt time come to an agonizing halt. In that moment, I saw myself in Simon’s gaze, a distorted mirror image that mocked my very existence. 
He stared at me, cold and detached. He slid his hands into his pockets before his lips curled into a twisted smile.

“Can I help you?” He growled, his voice laced with a predatory edge that made my words catch in my 
throat.

“I-I don’t know what you are…” I stammered with a mix of fear and anger. “But I know what you’ve been doing.”

“Do you now?” His voice was drenched in condensation like he was talking to another child. 

I furrowed my brow and took a step forward with clenching fists. “Whatever sick game you’re playing stops now!” I spat back.

Simon tilted his head slightly as if considering my words with detached amusement. His hand disappeared behind his back, the causality of the gesture at odds with the glinting handgun that was suddenly pointed straight at me. I screamed, shock and terror returning to me as I instinctively recoiled. 

“W-wait!” I pleaded, raising my hands in a futile effort of defense.
Simon calmly smiled, he held the gun against his side like a cowboy, his finger caressing the trigger, toying with it. “I won’t hurt you,” He muttered softly, 
“If you turn around and just forget this ever happened.”

“You can’t keep doing this…” I cried, shaking. “You can’t keep pretending to be me, you’re gonna ruin my life!”

His expression hardened, the lines in his jaw tightening. I heard the gun click.

“Go home.” He whispered, cold and final.
I stared into his burning eyes, before taking one step back, then another, before turning around and booking it in the opposite direction. As I ran, I heard laughter, my laughter. It buzzed around me, shaking me to my core. I glanced over my shoulder.

Simon was gone.
