When I was given the Dorkoshi black, I was one of the accepted few, and when I put on the Dorkoshi black, I was accepted by so few.

I walked on the bridge, carving a path through the oncoming crowd. Men, women, and children old enough to know moved to the railings once they spotted the blacks of my garb. Even their animals—the ones they could leash, carry, and cage with them—saw me as different. Their worries were all misplaced. I was not interested in those who left everything behind; I only cared about those who were left behind.

“Excuse me, sir,” I said, calling out to an old man.

The old man looked around, hoping I was talking to someone else, and then approached me slowly. His arm was looped around a cage, and inside the cage was a raven. It looked subdued.

“Which way to the nearest farm?” I asked.

“It would be thataway, sir,” the old man mumbled, eyes down at his feet, a shaky finger pointing in the direction of the setting sun.

I came closer to the man, and when I raised my arm, he flinched. I undid the lock to the cage and pulled open its door. At first, the raven only peeked outside, but when it saw no man would stop him, it leapt out. The raven nearly hit the ground, but at the last moment, it remembered it had wings, and it remembered the everlasting sky, and then the raven soared.

“These are uncertain times, sir,” I told the man. “Spend what’s left of your life with freedom.”

I walked through the hills, feeling the hot summer day cool off into a mellow evening. Gusts of wind tumbled into the tall grass, rolling through it in waves. Flocks of birds littered the sky, going not where they were told to go, but where they wanted to go. What an obscene time for beauty.

A Nar-Ghoul had been spotted. Actually, the Nar-Ghoul itself hadn’t been spotted—no one lived long enough once they spotted a Nar-Ghoul. What was usually spotted were the remains of a Nar-Ghoul attack. The remains could be an ear, a finger, or even a whole hand, but they were always paired with a non-lethal amount of blood.

When I reached the farm, I saw someone had left their ax next to a tree stump. It was a smart choice. Times like this, you needed to pack light and move fast. If you found yourself in a fight, it was already too late. I picked up the ax, testing its lopsided weight, then dragged it behind me.

I stepped into the pig pen, where all the pigs were asleep except one. This pig approached me, hoping for food, oblivious to the axe. Not too long ago, humans never stuck around long enough—never could stick around long enough—to tame their animals. The ignorance in this pig’s eyes was a luxury. But eventually, all luxuries had to be paid for. It wasn’t until I dug the axe halfway through its head that the pig remembered to squeal.

You can’t kill a Nar-Ghoul, but you can stop it from multiplying. In the past, the Dorkoshi used to cremate any stragglers, for even the dead became Nar-Ghoul. Over the last few hundred years, however, there was one group of people who never turned into monsters—those who blew their brains out. A Nar-Ghoul doesn’t need a heart or even a pulse to turn you into itself; it just needs an intact brain. And so it became Dorkoshi tradition to find those left behind and decimate their brains.

Guns were quicker, but my bullets were few. With an axe, I was the only limit. The evening passed in final squeals, screeches, and shrieks, and by the end, their blood soaked through my clothes. I wasn’t too concerned; Dorkoshi garbs washed easily. The stench, however, clung on.

Not long after leaving the farm, I heard a boy screaming. When I came closer, I saw his mother was pulling him along, and both of them were crying.

“We can’t,” the boy yelled. “It’s not right, it’s not-”.

“Pardon me, ma’am,” I said. “Why haven’t you already evacuated?”

The woman jolted back but kept her hand so tight around her son’s arm that her knuckles turned white. The boy squirmed under the pain. He was young, too young to know what I was, and with expert finesse, he wriggled out of his mother’s grip and ran toward me.

“JOHN NO-,” his mother screamed.

“Grandpa!” the boy cried, pointing somewhere. “We left Grandpa behind!”

I followed his direction and spotted a little cottage silhouetted against the sunset.

“You be a good boy, John, and follow your mother,” I said, “I’ll go see Grandpa.”

The woman took a step toward me, trying to say something, trying to do anything. In the end, she yanked her son by the arm and marched him toward the bridge. The boy turned around and gave me a hopeful look. I wish he hadn’t.

When I reached the house, I nearly missed the bird atop the roof until it let out a *caw* *caw*. It was the raven from before. I checked it again to make sure, and then I laughed, and then I cried. Here was a creature with wings, with brains, and without limits. It could have done anything else, been anywhere else. It was supposed to be free. And yet, it chose to be here.

Once I regained myself, I swung open the door to the house. The floorboards creaked as I entered, and I could feel something wet under my shoe, but by now it was too dark to really see. At the far end of the room, a silhouette of a man knelt in front of the fireplace and stared into the dying embers.

My bullets were few, and I knew I should have brought the axe, but humans were my limit. I would let the man know his choices, and if needed, I would give him the quick death he deserves.

“Forgive me for bothering you, sir,” I said, reaching for the small of my back where my gun was tucked. “We can’t allow you to stay here. Are you able to walk?”

The man didn’t respond, and as I got closer, I could hear his irregular breath, catching and starting in violent bursts.

“I’m sorry, sir, but I can’t afford to leave anyone behind.”

Just as I whipped out my gun, he turned, his face catching the embers’ glow, and I could see blood dripping down his neck, blood dripping from where his ear once was. I tried to fire my gun, but nothing happened. It wasn’t until I saw my hand a few feet away, still clutching the gun, that I remembered to scream.

I fell to the floor, clutching my bloody stump of an arm, then crawled over to my severed hand, my body screaming to be put back together. The Nar-Ghoul retracted some shape back into his arm and then clutched my face, forcing me to look at it. It wanted me to see my reflection through its eyes, to see that my brain was still intact.

“I’m sorry, sir,” the Nar-Ghoul said, its words sounding copied, hollow, occupied, but also carrying with it a hint of delightful understanding.

“I can’t afford to leave anyone behind.”
