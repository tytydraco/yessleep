 LoreGod Speaking and I'm proud to say I have evidence of how Humanity came to its end. And it's all due to ignorance.  


**"Human beings cannot be born evil."** This is a concept that the majority of humanity holds dear. 

Humans can't fathom something unexplainable being real.

The fact that a 13-year-old kid planned and flawlessly executed a homicide cannot be true.  The boy Precisely skinned and burned his parents alive over a period of 3 days. 

This child must have been clinically insane.

Something must have been wrong with him. What he did was far from normal human behavior.

....

Right...?

Scientists decided to do a study on the kid's brain.

They did every test possible on his brain and found nothing wrong with him. In fact, the number of exams and tests performed on his brain resulted in cancer.

 Absolute nonsense. This can't be? The scientists, shocked by the lack of results, questioned each other. They tried absolutely everything within the legal restrictions.

The lead scientist for the project got the government's permission to continue the research by **any means possible**. So that's what they did.

He was absolutely obsessed with figuring out what was going on with this boy's brain. They went as far as to commit a crime, killing him and removing his brain to further investigate.  **However,, It was all for naught, they still found nothing.**

Still determined, the team used their own funds and hired multiple FBI agents to take the investigation a notch further.

The FBI went through his files rigorously. Searching for everything and anything on the child, his family, and his family's history.

It was revealed that the kid had the most normal childhood ever and his family had simply been an average Caucasian household.

With nothing else up their sleeves, they had to live with their failure. Hundreds of thousands of dollars went up in smoke, the entire team couldn't come to a conclusion that they could sleep with at night.  The lead scientist was an atheist. However, this was his letter of conclusion for the project.

To the Deputy Staff of the Undercover FBI Org, To the Staff of the Presidential Moral Law Firm, and To The Staff of Human Psychology

**"The boy was possessed by the devil."**

**-end**  


5 Days Later   


The entire investigation was swept under the rug. However, rumors began to spread around the office. The Government got wind of this and quickly eradicated every scientist that took part in the project. 

Not willing to have any evidence or hiccups they simply passed the boy's corpse to the cremators. 

When the time came to Balm and cremate the boy's remains. The morticians found a marking on his spinal cord. Going to send it through the incinerators regardless, the older more experienced mortician stopped the process for a slight examination.

He fell to his ass in horror as his mind flooded him with memories from his first year working at the morgue. 

**It was not the first time he saw this mark.**

Once again he took a closer look to ensure his eyes did not deceive him. He then convinced his fellow mortician that this isn't normal they have to examine the body.

They put the body under the knife and examined the corpse closely.

The mark had the capital letter "S" and a clawed scratch on his back. The morticians were left perplexed. This was not a tattoo it was a scar. The Elder mortician has cremated tens of thousands of bodies. It was not the first time he saw this mark.

His worse nightmare just possibly came to reality.

In shock, he reported it to the undercover government authorities and explained his theory alongside potential evidence he's been keeping for years.

In his head, all the evidence added up now. It finally made sense to him.

At least that's what he thought. **He had no idea truly how little he knew.**

The evidence alongside his theory was enough to convince the DSUF(Deputy Staff of the Undercover FBI Agency) to fund and file another investigation.

And thus an undercover search for these "marked" individuals began.   


 On the first day**,** The DSUF(Deputy Staff of the Undercover FBI) gave out invitations to retired soldiers and drafted young soldiers from all over the United States. 

This was a private investigation, they signed their contracts and waited for their letters. The officers and soldiers that were on duty for this investigation were financially compensated generously. They had no idea what they were walking into. But they knew it had to be dangerous. 

On the second day, They got time to pack and were secretly given over 300 lbs of weapons, gear, and MREs.

In the evening they were sent a letter via email. The letter was encrypted and gave the locations of the Military Bases in which they should meet for the Briefing.

On the 3rd day----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# We interrupt your regularly scheduled programming to bring you this breaking news.

 **The state of Wisconsin is on high alert as we are heartbroken to report the disappearance of 700 people overnight.**  
**These individuals were reported as being "alive" less than 10 hours ago by their families.**  


**This is the most terrifying thing that has happened to the United States other than the Carpet Bombings of 57.**

**We have no factual evidence of what happened many have given their opinions on the situation. People say that they have seen sightings of UFOs, some say it's the end times and god has finally come for his people, others say they have seen demons and these people have been dragged to hell through the earth. When we get any information on the current situation we will be sure to update you.**

# We now return to our regularly scheduled programming.

This news about the 700 missing individuals petrified the soldiers in fear as this was the day that they were to arrive at the Military Base. **This could not have been a coincidence.**

Finally, on Day 3 almost midnight the recruitment process comes to an end. Over 40 thousand soldiers gather at the 2 Military Bases for the Briefing. Technology made it easy for them all to receive the same message. 

The DSUF started their explanation. The soldiers listened but in the back of their minds, the news of the 700 disappearances still shook them to the core. However, nobody asked any questions about that situation.

Finally, the DSUF finished explaining the story of the marked boy and what happened to his parents.

The soldiers were confused, if they already killed the boy then what was the problem?

The DSUF then explained if their "theory" is correct. This marked boy could only be one member of a potential cult.

This was not any normal cult.

If this cult hid under their radar for this long, they could potentially be a worldwide threat.

**18 years ago in the year 2050, on the island of Aruba, a cult of individuals illegally tampered with human DNA on a very large scale.**

**The results were never shared with the public due** **to the results being soo disturbing, repulsive and Mephistophelian. Our statisticians estimated if these results were shared with the public the suicide rate would spike by at least 90%.**

**The only ones that would be able to go back to living their normal lives would be those who simply deny the existence of these beings.** 

**Because the logical thing to do in this case would be to simply kill yourself. No man in their right mind would share the earth with such things.**

.....

The soldiers had no words. Some men were weak in the knees however the majority of the soldiers simply denied this information as being true. They felt disrespected by this "lie" and their lives and precious time were going to be put in potential jeopardy over a silly "theory" that couldn't be proven.

The government gave their reason as to why they couldn't reveal this information but how can they trust an organization that's notorious for lying? Because of this, the majority of the soldiers made the worse decision of their lives. This decision singlehandedly changed the course of human history.

The gods were waiting. Pen in hand paper on desk. They can finally turn the pages and write a new chapter in the book of human history.
