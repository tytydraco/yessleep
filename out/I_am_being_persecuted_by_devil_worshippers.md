Believe it or not, but I feel like I'm getting followed by devil worshippers and spirit whenever I'm not home. Maybe I'm also just crazy, but I feel like it's real. 

Let me explain, Ima start with my first encounter, 2 years ago.

FIRST ENCOUNTER 

I was on a trip with my church, my first vacation only with my friends and without my parents. It was fun, my first time seeing real mountains and everything was just beautiful. For some context: We were somewhere in South Tirol, Italy. The parts of Italy where the people speak German. The church had done those kind of trips before and also went to the same place multiple times.

We had program planned all the time, but something about it was off. Mainly 4 things.

Thing number 1: The room felt like it was haunted. It was pretty modern inside, but still one of those old village buildings from the outside. I'm not scared that easily, here in Germany most people don't really belief in ghosts and that stuff. But it was scary as hell. When it was night, you could sometimes see a silhouette standing behind the curtains, there was no jacket or something btw. The first night it already began to rain like shit and there was a thunderstorm. Then we heard sirens, not the fire department sirens from the station nearby, but those anti air sirens from ww2. Don't know where those came from till this day.

Thing number 2 : One day we went to the nearby forest. Besides it already being called "Cultists Forest" or sth, it was exactly what it sounded like. As we began to make our way there, we crossed and old factory. It was destroyed, old, it looked abandoned for quite some time. And still, there was someone working in his excavator. It was really bright and I should've been able to see him properly, but he was all black. We went up further to the forest and right at its entrance was an old farm. It looked fine at first, but there was an old farmer watching us. Staring at us, not blinking, not moving, just like a doll. But he was breathing. Creepy as fuck. 

Then we entered the forest. We found an old cave and in red paint "Satan" was written on the walls and it looked like someone lived there. That when the church Personell told us, cause they see we were panicking a bit:

'That's of course all just fun, you know, noone will harm us (Is doch alles nur Spa√ü, uns wird schon niemand was tun.)'

We trusted them and went down the path for half an hour or something. We always saw some black silhouettes moving through the woods. We could even see one peeking from behind a tree and then running away fast as he sees us. We told the adults, but they said:

'Don't be little kids, there's Noone (Stellt euch nicht so an, da is niemand)'

But there were people, everyone saw them, also the adults even if they didn't want to admit it.

We then arrived at an old bridge. It was known as a place where many people died cause of Satan. If you didn't give a offering to him first, you would die. We gave a offering, then went on the bridge. Right as we stepped on it thick fog appeared, we couldn't see our own hands anymore. Then rocks and wood was thrown at us. I thought it were the adults, but as soon as there was a rock the size of a brick flying towards us I knew it wasn't them. We ran away, ran all the way out. As we went away from the bridge, the fog disappeared. 

The old man was still standing in the farm like before, he hadn't moved a single bit, but he smiled.

Later we came to the forest again for hide and seek and while I was hiding I heard tribal music, laughter and loud drums. I never came back to that forest ever again.

Thing number 3: We explored an old bunker near our hotel. It was told that a woman with her small girl was brutally killed near the forest and since then haunts in the bunker. It was believed to be some fun by the adults and they also thought it was. I mean, till we found a secret path down with a whole bar, living spaces, etc. On one wall again written 'Satan'. We also found old clothing on the ground, white clothing like it was said for the girl to wear.

Thing number 4: Whenever we explored the village and streets around it there were many crosses, many places where people died with no real reason provided, even signs where a dozen people were listed on, noone knowing where they died. Villagers we could ask were barely seen. And I don't whya village this small needs such a big building to store dead people. Whatever...


SECOND ENCOUNTER

Again, on a trip with the church. I don't know why, but it only happens on those. We were in the Netherlands this time. Not that big of a encounter like the first time, but under our bed was blood, fresh blood. We lived in an old farm, there where the cows once slept. Call me stupid, but I could sometimes hear the cows at night even tho there weren't any and banging came from the sink. There was also some kind of room spray which said "cancer causing"??? I still don't know what that was.


ENCOUNTER NUMBER 3

That scared the hell outta me back then. I had those dreams, probably every night for two weeks. There were two versions.

Version number one: I stood in front of my school, chilling with friends. One old lady always came to us, either on a bike or on foot. She was either holding a knife or a gun. I was always the only one who ran, my friends froze. But she only followed me. She was really fast even tho she was so old. She sometimes ran on all four. She always catched me. I could never even leave the street. She always grabbed me, then said:

'You can't escape, it's coming'

I didn't wake up, somehow. Normally I wake up if anything scary happens in my dream, but she grabbed me. Slowly bored the knife into me. I felt pain, I first woke up when she grinned at me and said

'You can't escape, [my name]'


Version 2: I'm waking up as a younger version of myself, laying on the carpet next to my kitchen. I cant enter the kitchen or do anything, I'm just laying there and watching. My father's cooking or something and then a big dark figure, big wide smile, red eyes,stands next to my father. I try to warn him, but he doesn't hear me. Im screaming, trying to move, but it doesn't work. He kills my father. Then he comes towards me, saying:

'You cant escape, you're helpless' 

Before he then just goes to another room. The only way I can wake up from those dreams is trying to sleep on the carpet. I then wake up in my bed again. I know, it's weird. 


FOURTH ENCOUNTER 

This summer, again with my church. We were in Denmark, pretty nice area tbh. Nothing looked haunted. Well, thats what I thought.

It was midnight, all the boys were sitting outside watching the stars. That's when we heard noises from a nearby bush. 

'Quak Quak Quak' 

Like somebody tried to make frog noises really bad. It sounded like some gibberish nonsense, but it was scary. We heard footsteps and decided to go check. But nothing was there. We got an adult, he kinda froze as he looked around the corner, then stumbled back and said:

'There's nothing it was just the uh... Nearby van' 

We had to go to sleep. I couldn't sleep, but I didn't hear them again. 

And now the worst part, I think they are also devil worshippers or something. One day we had to sign some kind of offer or something, noone read it. 3 pages or sth, very small letters, only saying to put in your name on the last page. All I read was 'Danger, Life'. Weird stuff but we were doing sports so I thought this would make sense. 

One evening we then went to tell us haunted stories by the water. They talked about it as a "horror night walk". So we were expecting for them to scare us. But it was different. We arrived at the water and there were candles. We took each other's hands and he began to tell us stories. Stories of someone who died, who was working together with the devil and who comes back from the undead. I heard steps behind me, but I was so close to the edge that it was impossible for someone to walk behind me. He began to pray and I didn't really understand what he said. We weren't scared on the way back either and it all didn't really make sense. It was just like we were doing some kind of ritual. 


I'm probably just going crazy, but I'm scared of it.
