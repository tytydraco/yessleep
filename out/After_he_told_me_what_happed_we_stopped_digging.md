This is why we no longer dig. For some background, I work at an Antarctic facility, and I've been doing this since about the mid 90s. And I've been the leader and trainer of all groups since the 2000s. We have a constantly changing crew where people leave in the winter and a new group comes in next spring, and in one of these crews the people I'm going to talk about worked. Once here at this Antarctic facility we had two people, their names were John and Amy, they were engaged and said that they would get married shortly after they left (sigh) I wish I had seen that.   
  
A long time ago we had a drilling site about 3 miles away right next to Mackenzie sea. We were attempting to understand some of the history and properties of the continent. How foolish we were. This is what John had told me. One day, John and Amy had gone out to the mining site to check the progress and see if they had uncovered anything. After they had parked their snowmobile they had both gone down and prepared to do the regular check. John had been looking at the equipment to run the drill and checking if anything was damaged when suddenly “Uh John what is that?” stated Amy in an anxious tone.  
  
John had turned and saw buried in the ice was a large creature. Though they could only see its lower body they could make it two things, it was white and it was massive.   “What in the world?) But before John had gotten to air his voice, in a fraction of a second with one gargantuan thrash the thing broke through the ice and caused a wave of water to come and sweep through the facility!!! But how the temperature was twenty below zero, but John and Amy didn't think they simply ran so fast they couldn't even conceive what was going on in the moment. They ran up to the surface faster than the rapidly chasing water all the way to the surface but they didn't have time to think about getting on their snowmobile. They had ran to the sea ice in the heat of the moment and the water crashing out of the tunnel caused the piece of ice they were on to split apart from the mainland. They were now all alone surrounded in Icey cold dark Antarctic water and a solid two hundred feet from the nearest chunk of ice, they were stuck.  
  
 They called a rescue helicopter as they luckily had their satellite phones on them just like protocol. “hello , hello this is sos me and another researcher are stuck on a sea ice field in Mackenzie bay are coordinates are                         send help please”.   
  
but help wouldn't be there for the next couple of hours. That's when they saw it, an incredibly large object moving in the water through the fog,  the thing from the cave! It continued to circle their chunk of ice for over about 30 minutes sometimes disparaging deeper to simply reaper. John was looking for the creature when he heard Amy make a blood curdling scream and a splashing sound. He turned around and saw her writhing back in pain, he ran to her side “what happened” he yelled.   
  
“Something got me” she yelped in pain.  
  
He looked down and saw what it was. in her forearm was embedded a six inch long barb. she explained that she had seen something wiggling in the water and when she got about 3 feet of it a massive long thing came and stabbed her.  John immediately knew to keep it in as he knew if he pulled it the wound would bleed profusely and she would probably freeze to death. Another thirty minutes passed and John realized how much weaker she was becoming weak and he took her temperature. He was horrified that she was losing body heat faster than how the body naturally loses heat! Her temperature was going too low and she was becoming very weak and tired. John walked four steps away But before John could think of anything A splat of water was all John heard.  He turned around and saw it. an enormous claw reached from the water and grabbed onto the ice and then he saw the whole thing. It was hunched and then it stood upright and reached nearly ten feet, with Long shaggy white fur, an easily man sized tail, long snout arms and legs and pitch black eyes that resembled the darkest trenches of the ocean. It hunched back and then dropped to the ground and crawled on all fours slowly towards Amy’s fettle curled body. “AMY,” cried john.  
  
But The creature struck at lightning speed and bit into her leg and quickly crawled back to the water. John reached out to grab her; he was sure he could reach her in time but he missed her as she was dragged into the black cold water. John looked into the water as little air bubbles rose and pooped.  
  
The rescue helicopter found John two hours later, but John didn't say anything, he didn't even look at them. John returned to base late in the night but he was a total shell of his former self. Before, John was funny and very social. Now he was like a robot, he did things with zero passion and I didn't see him talk to anyone but me through the rest of his stay. the only thing I saw him do the whole time was use our computers and books and look and research ancient creatures and write information down in his journal which he took with him when he left. After John told me the story I shut the mines down, however I did send one more group to go and investigate the tunnel, and sure enough it was filled with now frozen water which we dug through. When we finally got to the main room we saw a massive gaping hole in the ice wall but one more thing was there when we looked through the crack in the wall we found dozens of animal’s bones that we have never seen before. I'm sharing this story to help tell you people there are some under us that should stay under, and should never be dug.
