I just found this sub Reddit and didn’t know where else to share this experience pretty much I  grew up in a small town nestled against a stretch of dense forest in northern PA. The kind of place where kids played outside until the streetlights came on, and everyone knew everyone. But there was one rule—never go into the woods after dark just for general safety. Predatory are a real thing, monsters…. Monsters are fucking not. 

We all heard the stories. People who went in at night and never came out. Hunters finding deer split open, but not eaten. Bones in the trees, too high for any animal to reach. Blah blah bullshit some Indian made up to scare the other tribes off there land. But none of those occurred in Pennsylvania, that I know of 

I thought it was just folklore.
Skinwalkers and shit like Bigfoot that isn’t real well, this is my testimony
I was 17, hanging out with my best friend, I’ll call him Luke. We were at his house, near northern Altoona, he lived on a cabin surrounded by dense country backed right up against the treeline. Around midnight, after too many shenanigans, and a couple drinks and trying to act tough we said we was gonna go out into the forest.

I didn’t want to. The 2 beers I drank upset my stomach because I hadn’t drank much before being underage so I didn’t want to walk, But I wasn’t about to look like a coward or be alone. His parents was not strict and they went to bed around 10pm 

So we grabbed shitty flashlights and stepped into the woods.

The second we crossed the tree line, everything felt wrong just eerie wrong.

The air was too still. No wind, no crickets, no rustling leaves. Not even any damn wind. Just silence.
We walked around 100 meters deep into the tree line inland. Laughing at each other wanting to star gaze 
Then we heard it from around what might have been say 50 meters away 

A very soft ascending clicking sound not like you imagine.

Not twigs snapping, not like an animal scurrying away it was something else. Like the wet clicking of a tongue against teeth but with a metallic ping like when a baseball connects off a aluminum bat or like radio static going in and out I thought someone was fucking with us 

We shined our lights around as . Nothing but trees. 

Then Luke focused his light at an upwards arc and in his slow pan suddlenly like he froze, I looked where his beam was focused and that’s when I saw it.

This is a very true story. I have fucking debated posting this anywhere because I don’t know what else to do and I don’t wanna keep this with me for the rest of my life. I think people deserve to know, and I know what I saw.

It was crouched in the branches, too high up for anything human to reach. At first, I thought it was just a trick of the shadow from our lights. It was shaped like almost like a lizard but with grey skin that had folds that layer over itself.  I don’t know what I saw. I don’t live in PA no more. I have never seen it sense. Never care to see it again. 

Then it moved.

Its limbs were too lStretched thin, like its bones had been pulled like taffy Its fingers were impossibly long and it
