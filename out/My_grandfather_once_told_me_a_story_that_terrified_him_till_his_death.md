“Natural disasters are often life changing. They take away a part of us with them.” This is what my grandfather used to say. He was the victim of a flood that occurred in our hometown. He was devasted by what had happened to him and our family in that year. This story is completely narrated by him and I will write it down in his words.

It was the year 1968, it was raining for three consecutive days. I had returned home with a bag of groceries. It was the time of festival and everyone was celebrating with their families. I lived with my wife and two children, a little boy, 5 years old and my daughter who was 10 at that time. We also had two dogs, Dela and Maxi. Their names are relevant for later context. My wife made a really good meal and we enjoyed our dinner. My buddy wanted to hear a story so I started telling him one. In no time, we fell asleep. For the context, we lived in a one-bedroom house in the rural parts of my country. 

Suddenly in the middle of the night, I heard a noise. It was a metallic clanking noise. My dogs started barking, and that woke up my wife as well. As we got down from the bed, I could feel water clogging up our bedroom. I always kept a flashlight beside my bed. I turned on the light and to my horror, I could see that there was a flood. By the time I got down from the bed to turn on the lights, I could feel the water level rising. The electricity was cut down. I turned the flashlight towards my wife and kids, and my wife was shaking with fear. Without thinking much, I hurriedly rushed to the kids and woke them up. I picked up my son and my wife held my daughter and we ran for the stairs. Dela and Maxi were there before us. Even they could sense the danger.

The water level was rising fast. By the time we got to the first stair, the water was already up to my knees. We rushed to the roof top somehow leaving everything in the room. It was raining heavily. From the top, we could hear people screaming and crying loudly. Most people in my area did not have a rooftop and the houses were made up of slanting tin roofs. I could hear a woman screaming in the distance, looking for her child. It was only ten minutes that we were on top of the roof, but the water level had risen to the level of the roof. The water was rising faster than I had calculated and it was a mind baffling experience. Many roofs had people hanging in them and screaming for dear life. 

By the break of dawn, the entire town was visible and it was flooded. Only the rooftops were visible. My children had fallen asleep in the pouring rain. Dela and Maxi covered them from both sides trying to protect them. My wife looked hopeless and had cried her eyes out. I went to the edge of the roof and what I saw still horrifies me to this day. Hundreds and hundreds of dead carcasses of animals were floating around. The water level was near my feet. The woman who was crying for her children was Martha, a single mother of two kids. She was holding one of her babies in her arm and the older child was stuck in the tree next to our house. The boy was dead and Martha was swaying to and fro with her baby and looking at the dead kid.
I was looking at Martha when suddenly I noticed someone crying for help. It was my friend Joshua. He was trying to latch onto a log that was floating and was getting carried away by the strong currents. Seeing him, I could not resist myself and jumped in the water to help him. I could hear my wife screaming my name and some other people in the distance. I swam against the tide and held on to Joshua. I took his hand and we started swimming towards my house. While swimming, I could feel his hands were icy cold. I didn't pay much heat to it. We managed to get to the roof of our house, and my wife pulled us up. As soon as the dogs saw Joshua, they started barking. This woke my kids up. Dela almost attacked him. I was taken aback by this as Joshua was well known in my house and we were like brothers. Dela and Maxi were known to like him a lot. 

Joshua was shocked seeing them so aggressive. I calmed them down, and asked Joshua to take shelter in our roof. He sat in a corner and started crying. He said that he had lost his family while climbing their roof and he was unsure if his family was alive. I sat beside him and shook him by his shoulder. 

"Come on man, they are gonna be fine", I said.

He did not seem so convinced at that time, so we all sat silently. Around noon, the water level had begun to drop but we could see many dead bodies of people and animals floating around. It was the worst nightmare one could imagine. My kids had started to cry because of hunger, and it was still raining. I was feeling helpless seeing the chaos around me. Joshua was sickly worried and he wanted me to find his family for him. I promised him I would do so once the water level drops a little more. Ignoring my kids cries, I sat in the corner with him and started chatting about his family. Joshua told me that his wife was pregnant and that he was going to be a father soon. I congratulated him. In the background, my wife was trying her best to calm our kids down. Soon it was dusk. Hunger was creeping in my body as well. I told Joshua that we should go look for food then find his family. He said, “My wife was carrying a basket of food while going upstairs. She had always this go to food basket ready with her”. I thought it was a great idea. Once we unite Joshua to his family, I could bring food for my kids. 

I had a plan in my mind. I wanted to swim against the current and use the trees as a means of anchor. My wife hated the plan but she reluctantly agreed to let me go knowing our kids were starving and that Joshua’s wife needed him. So, we started swimming. We swam some distance, held on to some trees, took rest for about a minute and swam again. Despite being on the same street, it took us almost 30 minutes to reach Joshua’s house. The water was dark and I could feel the cold gush of wind against my spine. As we reached his house, I saw his wife sitting hunched in a corner and crying. Even at that distance, I could see her baby bump. When she saw me, she came running to me and helped me get to the roof of her house. At first, I did not notice the thing lying in the corner of the room. I saw a man lying motionless. A shiver went through my spine. As I went closer to it, I could not believe my eyes. 

It was Joshua. Lying dead in the corner. I hastily turned back to see the water where Joshua was swimming. But there was no one. Visibly confused and shocked, I turned towards his wife, the quizzical expression evident on my face. She said that Joshua had died of heart attack the moment they went to the roof. I could not believe my senses and started walking backwards. I did not realize that I was on the edge of the roof and slipped in the gushing water below. I started to drown. I could not contemplate the situation. I could not believe what was real anymore. The streams started carrying me towards the direction of my house. Horrified, shocked and exhausted, my legs began to give up on me. I could not swim. As the streams drifted me towards my house, I could see my wife standing on the roof, Dela and Maxi barking. 

I was starting to lose my consciousness. As my eyes closed, I could feel someone tugging at my clothes. With half opened eyes, I could see Dela and Maxi pulling me out. Just as I was about to touch the edge of the rooftop, I saw a big log floating towards me, right where Maxi was. I gathered up whatever strength I had in me, trying to pull Maxi out. But before I could even reach her, the log was already there. Dela was over the roof, my clothes tugged in her teeth. I watched with horror as the log hit Maxi, killing her instantly, her body washing away with the current. 

The flood lasted for 24 hours, but it took everything from us. Our house had been tarnished, I had lost my friend, my dog, my neighbors and many more. The 1968 flood will always remain embedded in my memory and I will never forget the conversations I had with Joshua. My kids are married now and happily settled. They do not seem to remember what happened that fateful night. My wife knew the story of my friend. Sadly, she passed away 5 years ago, and now I just have this story to narrate to my grand-children. 

This was a real-life incident that happened to my grandpa. He sadly passed away on March 2020. Today I was thinking about him and suddenly remembered his story. I hope this story finds every other soul who had lost someone in the flood or any other natural disaster. I hope my grandfather remains alive in everyone’s memory.
