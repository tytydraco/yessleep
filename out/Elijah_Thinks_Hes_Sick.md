They told us we were helping. That this was the last stop before juvie or padded rooms, a chance for the kids to feel normal for a few months. 

Some were angry. Some were scared. Some didn’t know why they were here. Neither did we, half the time, but we’d found out eventually. 

We followed the protocols. Took notes. Administered meds. Broke up fights. Called parents. Cleaned blood off cabin walls and told ourselves it was “behavioral.” 

Most of the time, it probably was. 

But sometimes, a kid would say something that made your skin crawl. We weren’t allowed to talk about that stuff. That was above our pay grade.

 When a camper didn’t ‘make it home’, we filed a report. We’d offer the parents our condolences, and they’d offer us relief — some didn’t even fake it. 

There’s no handbook for how to feel about that. Though, after enough summers, you stop feeling anything at all. 

That this was normal until Elijah. ‘Normal’ ended at the camp, not in a blaze-of-glory kind of way but like smoke after putting out a fire.

I can’t tell if this is a warning or a confession but I need to tell someone; Elijah was a weird kid.

———————————

Didn’t cry when he got dropped off.

That alone made him strange, but not a reason to worry.

The others usually cry, or try not to — blinking too fast, biting their lips until they bleed, hugging their parents a little too hard, like they’re trying to memorize the way it feels — some even begged to go home, promising to do better. But not him.

He just stood there, at the edge of the gravel lot, where the forest opened its mouth wide around the camp like it’s waiting to swallow it back up. One hand clenched around the strap of a navy-blue duffel, the other limp at his side like it didn’t belong to him. The bag sagged at the corners, too heavy for his narrow shoulders. Looked like he’d sink if he tried to take more than a few steps.

Didn’t wave. Didn’t speak.

He just watched the car drive away. A dull gray sedan with mismatched plates and a taillight held together with tape. It didn’t slow down after it passed the gates — if anything it sped up. That’s not unusual for this camp.

He didn’t move or stop staring off. Not for a while.

Just stood there squinting into the tree line long after the car was gone. As if something in him refused to believe he’d actually been left behind.

When he finally turned, he looked right at me like I was supposed to tell him how to breathe next. Like I owed him a reason for why the sky was still blue and the birds were still chirping.

I remember thinking that maybe he’s just overwhelmed. Everyone grieves in their own ways, y’know?

We assigned him to Cabin 4.

The cabin itself leans too far left on its foundation. One of the windows won’t close all the way, and there’s a stain on the ceiling that everyone pretends not to notice. It smells like old wood and damp socks and whatever the last group of kids left behind.

He didn’t complain. Didn’t say anything at all, actually. Just ducked his head and stepped through the threshold like someone entering a church. 

The others looked up — Theo, Mason, and Marcus. Three boys, already sweaty from messing around outside, their pants stained with grass, shoes caked in dry mud, the air around them heavy with that preteen mix of bug spray and body odor.

Theo — a softer type, gave a small wave. Marcus barely glanced up. But Mason, Mason was a troublemaker, and he made ‘the face’. The kind of face you learn to watch for in this line of work — the look of a kid who knows how to sniff out weakness before it’s even settled into the room.

Still, there weren’t any complaints. They just went back to whatever half-hearted conversation they were having, and Elijah set his duffel down by the bottom bunk without a word.

He didn’t try to talk to them — just unpacked slowly, like someone doing inventory. Folded everything before putting it on the shelf — socks, shirts, underwear, all stacked like he was afraid of getting in trouble if they weren’t neat enough.

That first night, I checked on the cabin around 10:30. I always do rounds, make sure no one’s snuck out or started a fight or tried to climb the flagpole again.

The others were asleep, mumbling through their dreams or tossing around in their blankets, but Elijah was lying stiff on his back, eyes slightly open. Not fully, but just enough to show the whites, glinting when the flashlight passed over him.

I took a step closer, thinking he might be awake. But he didn’t blink — didn’t flinch. Just kept breathing slow and shallow, like it hurt to move.

I whispered his name.

Nothing.

“You feeling okay, Elijah?”

He didn’t sit up. Didn’t even turn his head.

“I think I’m sick.”

His hand moved to his throat. Just a touch — like he was checking for something. Then his stomach. Then the left side of his chest.

Now that I’m thinking back on it… I don’t remember him ever touching the same spot twice.

And I—
God. I smiled.

Reflex, maybe. That fake, reassuring half-smile they drill into us during training. The one you’re supposed to use when a camper tells you they saw something in the woods, or that they’re hearing voices again.

“You’ll be fine,” I told him. “Everyone feels off the first week.”

His eyes opened. His pupils barely dilated in the cabin light.

“I think something got in me,” he said.

Not a whisper. Not panicked. Just flat. Like he was reciting the weather.

I laughed — a little too loud.

“Probably the cafeteria chili,” I said. “That stuff’s taken out bigger kids than you.”

He didn’t even blink. Just kept looking at me like he was waiting for a better answer.

So I gave him one. Told him we’d go see the nurse.

He stood immediately, too fast, and followed close behind me. His footsteps quiet on the path — every few steps, I glanced over my shoulder to make sure he was still there, always was. Just a few paces behind, walking like a shadow that hadn’t decided what to belong to.

I took him to the nurse’s station, because that’s what you do when a kid says something weird but not dangerous. The protocol says to take them seriously, *without* validating. Track symptoms. Keep records. Keep moving.

But part of me — the part I don’t like to listen to — didn’t want to go inside with him. I’ve walked this path a hundred times before, dragging scraped knees and splinted wrists and spider-bitten fingers. But something about walking it with him made the trees feel taller. Made the shadows feel closer.

The nurse on duty was Betty. Late fifties, soft-voiced, always smelled like eucalyptus. Kept butterscotch candies in a drawer and used her own money for extra gauze. Sweet woman. Too good for this place.

She guided Elijah onto the paper-covered cot and took his vitals. Pulse: normal. Temp: slightly low, but nothing alarming. She checked his throat with a penlight, pressed her fingers gently along his jaw and collarbone, then wrote something in neat, practiced handwriting.
I watched over her shoulder as she turned the clipboard toward me.

‘His intake sheet says schizophrenia. Parents didn’t send meds.’

She frowned, clicked her pen once, and added underneath: ‘Poor boy :(‘

That was Betty for you. Professional, but human. Always a little heart left unarmored.

“Elijah,” she said gently, voice all honey and sugar, “how about you drink some water and rest up? We’ll see how you’re feeling tomorrow morning.”

He didn’t answer. Just stared at his hands in his lap like they weren’t his hands anymore, but something borrowed, and overdue.

Betty glanced at me and gave a small shrug, like we’d done all we could. Maybe we had. And I led him out.

We walked back to Cabin 4 in silence. 

Elijah never mentioned anything about meditation— I’d like to assume that maybe they were in his bag but it would be a fool’s assumption. I saw how that car drove off — it went the speed only parents that didn’t care could go.

When we got to the steps, I told him he’d be joining the others for group therapy that afternoon. He nodded once, barely perceptible, and walked inside without another word.



The next day, he told me his bones felt hollow.

I asked if he meant tired, or weak. He said no. He said when he moved, he could hear them *clink.*

The day after, he told me his teeth itched. He kept running his tongue along the back of them like something was lodged there. Said it felt like they were loose — like baby teeth. Like they were getting ready to fall out and be replaced with something new.

I looked. They were fine. Straight. Clean. White.

The day after that, he didn’t speak at all. Just sat on his bunk, legs curled up, rocking slightly. His left hand twitched every few seconds like it was on a different rhythm than the rest of him — like it was waiting for a cue the rest of his body hadn’t gotten.

When I asked what was wrong, he didn’t answer. Just kept shaking the hand, watching it like he didn’t recognize it anymore.

The others started to notice.

Kids like Theo and Marcus mostly ignored him. They weren’t the type to get involved. They pretend not to notice when Elijah lingered too long near the doorframe or skipped a meal. 

But Mason — Mason had no patience for weird.
He was tall for thirteen—the kind of frame that promised varsity letters in a couple years. Broad shoulders, strong jaw, buzzed haircut that made him look older than he was. A permanent sunburn clung to his cheeks and nose making him raw-looking, like he’d been carved out of meat and defiance. 

He wasn’t a bully, exactly — bullies try. Mason didn’t. He just was. 

He started calling Elijah names.
“Infection.”
“Tapeworm.”
“Bubble Boy.”

One afternoon, Elijah was sitting on the porch, knees drawn to his chest, staring at his fingertips.

Mason walked by with his towel slung over his shoulder, paused just long enough to sneer, “Watch out, he’s molting.”

A few of the others laughed. Elijah didn’t.
I could’ve stepped in then. Should’ve. But we’re told not to escalate — these were ‘troubled’ kids. We needed to be tough and some areas and gentle in others. This was one of those ‘gentle’ areas. If I stepped in things could get worse — they do but, how could I have known then?

One night after lights out, Mason took a pocketknife from his sock and carved a line into Elijah’s forearm.

Nothing deep. Just enough to sting. Enough to bleed. Enough to prove a point.

“If you’re sick, then make me sick,” he whispered, crouched beside Elijah’s bunk. 
“Come on. Contaminate me.”

Elijah didn’t move. Just watched the blood bead up on his arm like he was waiting to see what it would become.

Then I walked in. I snapped the flashlight on and found them like that — Mason crouched over Elijah, who sat up quickly after seeing me in the doorway  — the cut glistened dark against the pale skin of his forearm.

Protocol says: No blood, no action.
There was blood now.

I wrote up Mason. Wrapped Elijah’s arm with gauze and antiseptic, hands stiff, trying not to shake. Logged it as a “minor peer incident.” 

Just another page in a binder full of half-truths. A regular part of camp life.

Elijah never said a word. Not during, not after. Not even when I asked him if he was okay.

The next morning, Mason didn’t show up for breakfast. Found him in his bunk, bed soaked through with sweat, his lips pale, breathing shallow and rapid. 

Fever of 104.2. Eyes glassy.

By lunch, he was coughing blood — thick and sudden, sprayed down the front of his shirt like paint from a popped can.

By sundown, he was dead.

Betty said it was fast. Said it might’ve been meningitis. Or a rare bacterial infection. Or maybe some kind of internal sepsis. 

“These things happen,” she told me, wringing her hands like she could wash the memory off.

The camp director called the team into his office and shut the door. He told us not to speculate and to clean the cabin and burn the bedding. To call the family.

That was my job. 

I sat in the rarely used Visitors Center with the receiver slick in my sweaty hand, heart pounding like I was the one on trial. 

It rang twice. The line clicked, and a woman picked up.

I said my name and started the script we always read when a camper didn’t go home.

“Mason? My Mason?? Are you sure?”

“Yes, ma’am,” I said. “I’m very sorry.”

There was a long pause — just us and the hollow crackle of a landline holding its breath.

“Okay,” she said. “Okay. That’s… fine.”

I blinked. “When would you like us to return his things..?”

“That... won’t be necessary.”

I hesitated. “Do you want his body?”

“No.”

Flat. Unbothered.

The stress of losing a kid almost clouded my common sense. For a second, I forgot the kind of people who sent their children here.

“…Okay,” I said. “Have a nice day.”

And then the line went dead.

Luckily, I wasn’t in charge of the graveyard.

Elijah didn’t seem upset when I told him. He sat on his bunk, cross-legged, tracing the edge of the gauze on his arm with one finger.

“I didn’t do anything,” he said.

I didn’t say anything.
Didn’t ask if he had.
I didn’t want to know.

There are questions you don’t ask here. Questions that live under your tongue like splinters. If you pull them out, you bleed.
I told him to get dressed for dinner. He nodded and stood.

At the mess hall, no one sat beside him.

Theo and Marcus moved to another table without making eye contact. Elijah didn’t seem to care much. He picked at his food, rearranged it, took exactly three bites, then sat staring at his tray like it might tell him something.

Few days go by, then Theo got sick.
Then Marcus.
Same cabin.
Same symptoms.
Only now it was faster.

No warning, no ramp-up. One day they were fine—tired maybe, a little pale—but still throwing pinecones at each other, still laughing at fart jokes during group therapy. The next, they were drenched in sweat and too weak to sit up.

We tried to move Theo to the infirmary. He died before we could even get the paperwork sorted.

He was sitting up one minute, asking if he could have some apple juice. The next, his head just... slumped forward. Like someone unplugged him.

His lips were blue.
His body was warm.

Betty cried. I didn’t. Couldn’t find the will.

The cabin smelled like iron and bleach for a week. Harsh, clinical, and sharp. Seeps into your teeth when you breathe.

I remember scrubbing the mattress frame while the others burned the rest of their things out back. Elijah’s old bunkmates—gone. Just ash, and empty beds. The wooden floor creaked when I stepped out the cabin for the last time, like it resented being left behind.

Every time I blinked, I saw Theo’s mouth open again— Marcus’s glossy wide eyes. 

We tried airing the room out but it didn’t work.
The smell sank in and no longer would it smell of old wood and damp socks — just pain.

Transferred Elijah to a single occupancy room.
It was a converted equipment shed with one narrow cot, a bare bulb overhead, and nothing else. Concrete floor. Metal walls. Nowhere for anything to hide.

I remember standing in the doorway while he unpacked — not that there was much to unpack. The same duffel bag he’d arrived with, now slumped and hollow like it had started to rot from the inside.

Elijah just set the book on the cot, sat beside it.
“I’m sorry..”

“Don’t apologize buddy, people get sick.”

He looked up at me, “I’m sick.”

I didn’t respond.

He just wasn’t. He kept getting paler, quieter. Every few days, he’d report a new symptom, always vague—tingling in his fingers, his ribs clicking when he breathed, shadows in his peripheral vision that didn’t go away when he turned his head.

But no fever.
No cough.
No signs of a real illness, except for the aftermath left behind in every bunk he’d ever shared.

The working theory was suggestibility.

That Elijah was mirroring the symptoms he saw in others. That he was sick, yes—but not in the way he claimed. His file said schizophrenia. His parents had signed off on that label but didn’t leave any meds. No dosage instructions. No emergency contacts.

So we told ourselves this was psychological. That the mind was powerful enough to fool the body. That Elijah believed something was wrong, so his body played along.

And the others?

The others must’ve picked something up from somewhere else. They were boys. Dirty, stubborn, hands always in their mouths or rubbing mosquito bites raw. They spent every hour together—eating, sleeping, horsing around.

They shared water bottles.
They shared towels.
They shared air.

Elijah was always outside of that. Thanks to Mason, he was the weird kid, the “Bubble Boy,” the one no one touched if they could help it. The one who sat alone at meals and took his lake time standing ankle-deep in the mud, staring at his reflection.

So, if anything, he should’ve been the only one spared.

And that’s why we were isolating him.

“Good night Elijah, I’ll see you in the morning.”

That night, the nightmares started.
Dreams were something I used to crave after working here — an escape, a soft place for my mind to land. To lie down and, for eight blissful hours, not be where I was. But I regret ever wishing for it.

The first one came slow, like a fever taking hold. White sheets soaked red, still warm. My hands pressed down on a chest that no longer rose. Teeth in the dirt — not fallen, but planted.


Another night: I was chewing something tough, gristly, and when I spat it into my palm, it was a molar. Not mine. Too small. Yellowed at the root.

Then there were the ones with Elijah.

Always the same: I’d wake up in the dream, lying in my own bunk, cold air curling around my ankles. The door would be cracked open just enough to let the moonlight in. And there he’d be — standing at the edge of my bed, staring.

It got so bad I stopped checking his cabin. I told myself he needed space. Time to grieve. 

But really? No one wanted to go near him. We started leaving his meals on the porch like offerings.

One tray in the morning. One at night. Sometimes he’d take them. Sometimes he wouldn’t.

And the worst part — the part I hate most — is that we never asked if Elijah *wanted* to hurt anyone.

We assumed. Because that was easier.
Because if you let yourself believe the sickness was real, then you have to admit you let it spread. 

That you made excuses, filed reports, followed protocol, and kept going.

Even when you knew something was wrong.

I’m such a fucking idiot.

And now?
Now the infirmary’s full.

Betty won’t come out anymore — Campers are collapsing in the field. They cough black. They bleed quiet.

The director hasn’t been seen in two days —
could be facedown on his desk, dead in his locked office, for all we knew.

The radios are static.

No vans came Monday. No calls went out Tuesday.

Everything smells like Cabin 4. Like iron and rot and bleach that never quite worked.

I don’t know how long I’ve got before it gets me too.

After Betty stopped talking from behind her locked door, I left.

Just grabbed my keys, got in the car, and drove. There’s nothing back there.

I’ve been driving ever since. I thought maybe distance would help. That if I got far enough,
whatever this is — whatever *he* is — would lose track of me.

I’m sorry, Elijah.

You asked for help, and I told you to drink water. I don’t know if you were the cause or just the warning..

But I think it’s in me now, too.
