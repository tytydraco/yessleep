I’m at home with both of my parents. We are having breakfast when I hear a knock at the door. Dad walks over to answer it. My niece Lila and her aunt Claire are at the front door.

Claire asks if they can stay at our house for the next few weeks because there’s an event where all of the extended family will be coming to visit our place. Everyone else has found other places to stay, but Lila and Claire thought it might be best if they stayed at our house for the next few weeks.

My mom walks over and gladly invites them in. I feel excited about having people stay over at our house. My mom decides that Lila and Claire will both be sleeping on the third floor.

That night, as I go to bed, I feel comfort in knowing that there are more people on the floor above me. The house always feels safer when it’s full.

I wake up early the next morning and head downstairs to figure out what I should have for breakfast. As soon as I get down to the kitchen, I discover that there are a lot more snacks on the counters than usual. Baskets are lined up on the green and black countertop, filled with a large variety of colorful treats.

On the counter to my left as I first walk in, there is a basket full of donuts with pink icing and sprinkles, a basket of crackers, and a basket full of candy. To my right, where the kitchen stools stand next to the counter, there is a basket full of bread and a basket full of fruits.

I am curious about the increase in snacks around our kitchen but don’t question it. I eat a donut and call it breakfast. Later that day, Claire explains to me that she had brought some snacks and I am welcome to help myself. My mom tells me that the snacks were set in baskets for the events to come.

After lunch, the doorbell starts ringing a lot as groups of relatives begin to arrive on their own time. I am on the first floor and about to head up to the second floor for some peace and quiet. My mom is walking up the stairs at the same time as me.

Somehow, the stairs feel as if they have gotten longer. My mom and I have an argument about something as we walk up. Before we reach the last step, my mother tells me that there is someone she wants me to smile for.

“Oh, by the way, I know you're upset right now, but if you see \_\_\_ relative, I’d like you to smile for her.”

“And don’t mess this up or there will be consequences,” she warns with a serious expression on her face.

Now, in case you’re wondering why I decide to go upstairs in the first place—it’s because I’d had a rather overwhelming experience with the crowd of people on the first floor. For some weird reason, everyone keeps asking me to smile for them.

That is why it feels so significant when my mom asks me to smile for a specific person. Apparently, in this dream, everyone thinks my smile is unusually beautiful and will turn their bad day into a good one.

I make it to the second floor and head over to my parents' room. I hope to avoid finding this person my mom wants me to smile for. But much to my dismay, I find her talking to another relative in my mom and dad’s room.

She sees me, and I explain that my mom had asked me to give her a smile. “Ok, well then let's see the smile,” she says in a less than friendly tone. She looks at me with a bored expression.

I am still very upset by my argument with mom from earlier, so I find it extremely hard to force myself to smile for this lady. This lady who doesn’t seem to care that my mom wanted me to smile for her.

The lady gives me a stiff smile in return, and there is an awkward moment of silence. Then I run to my room and sit down on my bed. I dread what punishment I might get for failing to please the lady my mom told me to smile for.

She is the first one in the entire dream to not freak out and get all excited over my smile. Eventually, I fall asleep.

The next morning, I wake up and head straight down to the kitchen. I eat a pop tart and a donut for breakfast. My mom picks out some nice clothes for me to wear.

I get into my dad's car and arrive at a small church building along with my dad, Lila, and Claire. We walk into the church and sit down. I end up sitting at the very front of the left row.

A tall and thin girl sits down next to me. She has black hair tied up into a long ponytail. She wears prescription glasses. The girl turns to me and introduces herself. Her name is Alley and she likes writing a lot. I tell her that I am a writer as well. After that, we quickly become friends.

“Here, let me show you something,” Alley says as she pulls out a yellow notepad and a blue-ink pen. She begins writing something on the notepad.

While Alley is busy writing, I look up and watch the service. There are people singing on the stage right in front of us. There are three singers, an electric guitar, a keyboard, an acoustic guitar, a drum set, and Elise dancing in the front.

All of Lila’s family except for Lila and Claire are on the stage.

I feel a tap on my shoulder. It is Alley. She holds up her yellow notepad and hands it to me.

“Here, read this,” she says.

I look at the notepad and see that she has written a short story of sorts. Her handwriting is a little harder to read than mine. The letters are ragged and squiggly but it isn’t cursive, so I am still able to read it.

I can’t remember exactly what was on the notepad, but it goes something like this…

There once was a man who lived on a mountain. This mountain was also a small island. The man lived on the island with his pet goat and there was no one else around. His home was a sturdy log cabin. The inside of the log cabin was organized and clean. The man made sure that his pet goat was well fed and provided with fresh water.

Every day, the man would take his goat for a walk. He would tend to his vegetable garden. He would climb down the mountain and onto the beach. There, he would tend to his small fishing boat. Then he would go out into the ocean and fish for one hour.

When he got back home, he would prepare a meal of cooked fish with vegetable stew. After a hard day of work, he would go to bed and fall asleep. This is how the man spent almost every day of his life—until one day when something new happened.

The man and his goat were standing at the edge of the mountain looking over the horizon when he looked down and saw someone float onto shore. He climbed down the mountain as quickly as possible to take a closer look at the situation.

This was the first time in years that the man had seen anyone. A skinny teen who looked about 18 years old had floated onto the island. He was still conscious and had begun coughing out water, but by the time the old man had gotten there, he passed out from exhaustion.

The man carried the boy back to his cabin and took care of him for three days before he woke up again. The man was at his vegetable garden when he heard a loud crash coming from inside the cabin.

He ran over as fast as his elderly legs could carry him and flung the door wide open. There he saw the boy standing in a corner of the cabin, panicked.

“Where am I?” asked the boy when he saw the man.

The man hadn’t spoken in a very long time, so he gave the boy the only answer he could.

“Home.”

The boy was confused but didn’t ask any more questions. That night, while they were having dinner, the boy told the man his story. He had been traveling in a boat with his family when they were caught by a storm. Their boat crashed and the boy was the only survivor.

He hung onto a floating piece of wood for as long as he could. Eventually, he caught sight of the island and became excited. He let go of the wood and began swimming toward the island, but he got tired before he was able to reach the shore. He ended up floating the rest of the way and passed out from exhaustion.

The man listened to the boy's story quietly. It wasn’t as if he was able to say much anyway. Eventually, the boy asked the man why he never said anything.

The man answered him, speaking very slowly.

“This…A…very…lonely…island…no…people…come…here.”

The boy simply nodded and then helped wash the dishes.

The man, the goat, and the boy lived together peacefully for three weeks. One day, the man went over the ledge to look out into the horizon. He left the goat behind with the boy, who went fishing.

The man leaned out a little too far and fell down onto the rocks and the ocean below. The boy saw the man fall from the boat and drove over to save him. When the boy got there, the man was already dead and his body had mysteriously vanished.

The boy spent the rest of the day grieving. When he went out the next day, he saw that the vegetables needed watering and the goat needed to be taken care of. The bucket for fish was empty.

So the boy took care of the goat, tended to the vegetable garden, took the goat for a walk, climbed down to the fishing boat, and went out for an hour. When they came back, the boy climbed back up to the cabin and prepared some cooked fish and vegetable stew.

I thought the last page made the story feel unfinished, but I didn’t tell Alley. I handed her the notepad and we watched the rest of the service together.

When I made it back home, I walked upstairs and found the relative from earlier who I was supposed to smile for. I walked into my parents' room, said hi, and smiled again.

She looked bored and completely ignored me. I walked out of the room quickly and decided to call it a day. I wasn’t feeling very well anymore.

The next morning, I headed down for breakfast and ate two donuts—one with chocolate frosting and the other with strawberry pink frosting.

After breakfast, our family headed out to the church building again. We took dad's car this time as well since it could fit up to six people.

My mom, my dad, Lila, Claire, and I all hopped out of the car and found a place to sit. I sat in the same spot as yesterday. The same people got on stage and began to perform.

Today, my brother Nate was going to read some bible verses, and we were going to sing a bunch of songs.

Alley sat down next to me and began writing in her yellow notepad. I decided not to bother her and focused on watching the church service instead.

After the first song, Alley tapped me on my shoulder and pointed to her notepad. I nodded understanding that she wanted me to read whatever she had been writing, and she handed it over to me again.

This time she had written a poem called Life, and it went something like this…

When you think you’ve had enough but you still have a lot more to get through, what can you do?

Your only choice is to keep on moving forward.

And yet every single step you take

Requires more of your time and energy

Until you begin to ask yourself when will you break?

Every day you feel like you’re being watched.

But you have to ask yourself who?

Who is watching you in your sleep?

Who is watching you as you eat?

It may sound creepy but you don’t feel stalked.

Not a person but some other entity.

A protector, of sorts.

Again, Alley’s piece of writing had no real ending to it. No solid conclusion to answer any questions the reader may have.

I’m not sure if it's intentional, or if she just doesn’t know how to write an ending, but in the end, it was still a good read.

When I got back home, I began to walk upstairs when I heard the words:

“Nothing you do here will change a thing.”

All I could think as I kept walking was what the story Alley wrote in her notebook could mean.
