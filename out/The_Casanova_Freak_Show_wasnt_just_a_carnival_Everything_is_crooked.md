The house smelled like rust and burned coffee. I spent the rest of the night cleaning what was left, wiping the streaks of blood that had sprayed across the walls and floor. Every stain seemed to sink deeper the harder I scrubbed, darkening the wood instead of coming up.

When I poured the bucket out in the sink, the water looked wrong—thicker somehow, with a film that shimmered like oil.

I didn’t call anyone. I didn’t even think to. What would I have said—that something from a television bled out onto my floor and died screaming?

They would’ve sent a wellness check, maybe a padded van. No, I just wanted silence. To make everything still again. To make it mine.

But the silence didn’t feel still anymore. The floor creaked where it hadn’t before, the boards subtly slanted beneath my feet.

When I tried to hang the kitchen clock back up, it wouldn’t stay straight. I fixed it three times before realizing the wall itself had bowed slightly outward, just enough that the plaster looked warped in the light.

By morning, my arm had swollen where the glass had caught me. The skin was red, then pale, then something else entirely—too smooth, too stretched.

When I pressed it, it didn’t feel like flesh anymore but something dense beneath the surface, like a cable under tension. It pulsed against my thumb once, slow and deliberate, as if whatever ran through it wasn’t blood.

I wrapped it in gauze and pretended it didn’t hurt. Pretended it didn’t move. Because I’d seen it do that, just once—when I leaned over the sink, the reflection caught the edge of my bandage.

The cloth twitched. Not a trick of the pulse or pain, but a deliberate, tiny flex. Like it was testing itself.

By afternoon, the gauze was damp again. I thought it was blood until I unwrapped it. The skin underneath had gone colorless, gray around the edges, and the veins had darkened to something near black.

But they didn’t run in the same direction anymore. They zigzagged, crossing under the skin at sharp angles, splitting and reconnecting in patterns that didn’t make sense.

I could trace them with my fingertip—thin crooked lines, uneven as if drawn by a shaking hand. When I touched one near my wrist, it twitched, then shifted slightly to avoid me.

It slid out of place, burrowing deeper. The movement was subtle but alive, and I almost screamed.

I threw the bandage away and scrubbed the wound until it bled again, thinking maybe I could wash out whatever infection this was. But the blood came slow, syrup-thick, darker than it should’ve been.

It had a smell too, faintly metallic but wrong, like wet copper left out too long.

When I finally looked up, my reflection was waiting for me in the mirror. The steam had cleared halfway, leaving the image split—half fog, half clarity.

My left arm didn’t match my right. The muscles didn’t line up correctly anymore; the bend of my elbow was slightly higher, the wrist joint angled inward.

It wasn’t dramatic, just… off. Enough to make me dizzy if I stared too long.

That night, I tried to sleep, but the house wouldn’t stop breathing. The walls flexed with every gust of wind, sighing through the cracks.

The pipes hummed with something slow and rhythmic. It wasn’t the plumbing. It was a heartbeat.

When I woke, the wound had sealed itself entirely. No blood, no scab. Just smooth, grayish skin.

I couldn’t even find where the cut had been—except for one thing. When I clenched my fist, the joints didn’t all move the same way.

My ring finger bent slightly backward, just enough to catch the light wrong.

It didn’t hurt. That was the worst part. It didn’t feel broken.

It felt like it wanted to bend that way.
