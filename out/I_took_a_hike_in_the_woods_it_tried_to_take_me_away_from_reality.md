It was 9:28, the car was parked, bag pack stuffed with the essentials, I was ready. I was 30 minutes into the hike when my mother called me. 

" Yellow" I said.

" Hey sweetheart, how are things going with that trop?"

" So far so good, hadn't found a spot for sleeping though"

" Well good luck with that. Also be safe, don't know why you decided to camp there but just be safe, ok"

" Don't worry ma, I'll be safe, alright"

"ok then, bye Rei, love you"

" Love you too ma" 

I walked, and walked more. Passing by trees that were bigger than buildings. Bushes home to exotic bugs with unnatural colors. Rivers containing salamanders with three legs. I watched birds fly through the forest and into the sky. It was beautiful, I felt great even. However, despite of all of these nice views, I still couldn't find a place to build my tent, if anything, it was odd. The tree were all evenly spaced out, there was no movement on the path. It just went straight on. A path should at least have some bumps in it but this one didn't even have a stick to step on. And the sun, it should be at its peak by now. But it's still at the same spot when I entered the forest. That was, concerning.

Eventually found this one part of the path. It branch from the road I was taking.Unlike this one, it actually look like a path for hiking.Messy and muddy. Yet found myself just standing, my body was giving me goosebumps. I didn’t know whether I should  continue walking or follow this new path. 

And yet my legs decided for me, walking down this uncharted path. I came upon this sign that read “ keep out”, which my body ignored and climed the gate.My body walked and walked more, not knowing when to take a break. And there, right in front of me, a flower. It was thicker than the others around it, gray to the bone with red faded towards the end of the petals. My body gets to an even level with the flower, my eyes starring into the center of the flower. 

There was a tiny ball at the center with a straight line in the center. The gray parts of the stem almost looked like exposed muscle. Pulseing and moving like a muscle too. I reached for the flower, the tiny ball opened. An eye watched me as I fumbled on to the ground. The flower was now glowing, the muscles it had for a stem was now fully shaking. It's one eye, like a cyclops, just stared at me.It didn't blink, it didn't move, just stared. Standing there, with the time around us stoping.

The earth around it was now shaked, the flower was grew taller and taller. A shoulder now exposed for me to see. It's body being made out of a plant like material with very little real muscle. A arm bursted through through the dirt, it shoved itself out of the earth enough for the other arm to come out. That was my sign to get out.

My body ran and ran, the sound of the creature echoed through the forest. I pushed through bushes, piles of leaves, weaving pass tree after tree. Any time the monster sounds faded, they will appear again in a different direction. The more I ran, the more the environment started to changed as well. The trees gradually stretching into the sky, almost looking paint like. The branches at the end having hands, all reaching out. Every single one looking to be reaching for something impossible, something bigger them themselves. And the sky, that red soaked sky, it went pass the horizon line and beyond. And all of the smaller plant life now melting into the ground, looked like pieces of flesh now merged into the skin like ground. Where ever I was, it was not the place where I began. 

I hid behind a tree, just trying to catch my breath. The flower thing looked behind any tree it could see. It slowly coming to the patch of trees I was hiding in. My heartbeats growing faster and louder. Sweating was sliding down my face. Visible shaking in my hands. I felt so lost, so alone. I just wanted to be alone with mother nature, but now was alone with that thing. 

Call me weak, call me stupid for this but, I cried. I dragged my body down against the tree and cried. That thing cries echoing throughout this hell and I broke down. My neck feeling tingling, my vision was blury, me curling up into a ball. At the time, it felt so lost, the hell was I supposed to do with that thing. And it's one eye looking for me. The silence of everything now surrounding the entire area of this place. With a sound of a little bird singing cutting through that hellish silence. 

Couldn't tell you why, even if you pointed a gun at me, but I just ran. I followed the sounds of the little bird. I thought at least if I was going to die, I would at least see something beautiful . The beast saw and chased me, it's cries sounding like it came from the deepest pits of the human brain. I gave it all of my might and sprinted. If I was going down, I'll do it while giving all that my body had to offer. 

Finally, fucking finally, I found the source of the birds singing. It was coming out from this circle attached to a tree. It had some thing covering it but it was clear enough to see what was through it. It was a forest, but it was covered in green, healthy trees and singing birds. With all that my body had left, I dashed towards the gate, threw myself into the circle and bursted through the other side. 

Oh the fresh, clean air. The trees all randomly placed, with beautiful shades of brown. And the birds, oh how lovely are their singing. But quickly remembered where I just came from, I looked behind be to see if the beast followed me. And, it didn't, hell, it wasn't even there. It was gone, nowhere to be seen. However, something was there, it took me a while but it was there. It was a huge creature in the distance, it towered over the trees and beyond.It's body parts so impossible to describe, so void of detail I couldn't understand. It gave a blood thirsty cry that would make a skin walker tremble in fear. The portal that saved me was now closing. The last thing I ever saw of that place was the giant entity taller than a mountain. 

I'm in my car as I'm typing this. My ma called me but I didn't respond. I just sent her a text that I'm ok. Still trying to wrapped my head around what just happened. Hell, I almost died, and that place. My body shivers but my mind is telling me to go back. My heart is hoping that never happens. That flower beast, how something so small can turn into that is beyond me. 

There's something that I have to tell you though, I wasn't telling the full truth about everything. The thing I saw before the portal closed, there was one thing my human brain could recognize. Despite having a body so impossible of physical form, it had one thing I could see. One, giant eye.
