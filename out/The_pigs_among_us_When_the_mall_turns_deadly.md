[Part 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/165f6ho/the_pigs_among_us/)

I couldn’t tell what was going on. Around me lay a sprawling landscape of hundreds of lifeless bodies, stretching as far as the eye could see. Their faces grotesquely contorted beyond recognition, with empty, soulless voids where their eyes once were. Their limbs appeared twisted and mangled, painting a grim portrait of a world gone horribly wrong.

As I gazed up at the sky, a chilling eclipse was in progress, casting an eerie darkness over the macabre scene. The oppressive silence was only broken by the haunting sobs of someone kneeling beside me. My heart ached for that person, overwhelmed with an intense desire that they wouldn't endure the weight of this harrowing ordeal in solitude.

“I’m sorry Alex. I never meant for this to happen.” Before I could respond I was woken up by the man.

“Hey man you good? It seemed like you were crying, so I decided to wake you up.” He asked, his concern evident in his voice as he got to his feet.

It was nothing more than a dream then. A rare one, since I can still remember it very clearly. I wiped my eyes and got out of bed. It had been 2 days since the school incident and yesterday was a blur.

After we left the hospital, the man took us to a hotel. Thankfully, they had a lot of rooms to spare. The plan was for the man and I to share a room, while Olivia would occupy the adjacent one.

“Let’s rest here for today, tomorrow I have somewhere to take you.” After that, the man casually went behind the reception and swiped 2 room keys.

“Hey! Put that back we’re supposed to pay, aren’t we?” I protested, reaching for the keys in his hand.

“I’ve been here before Alex, so it’s not like they’re gonna remember anyway.”   I couldn't argue with that logic. Glancing at Olivia, I noticed that she didn't seem to object either. She simply nodded in agreement, staying close to us.

The receptionist's voice cut through my thoughts, “Excuse me sir, do you have a reservation?”

Quickly, the man positioned himself between me and the receptionist, a sly grin on his face as he taunted,  “See, she can’t tell I’m here. She probably thinks you nuts or something. Talking to yourself and all.” He playfully waved his hand in front of her.

The receptionist remained composed but increasingly puzzled. "Sir?"

I shook my head, gently nudging him aside. “We were just checking this place out, please don’t mind us.”  I flashed a strained smile to reassure her.

The receptionist's expression eased somewhat. "If there's anything I can assist you with, please don't hesitate to let me know."

After that, we both made our way to our respective rooms. The sudden wave of exhaustion washed over me, and I collapsed onto the bed. The man kindly placed a blanket over me, and as I was drifting into sleep, a knock on the door startled us.

It was Olivia, looking slightly embarrassed. "Can I sleep here with you guys? I don't think I'll be able to sleep by myself."

The man glanced briefly at me and then headed for the door. "Sure, you can sleep here with Alex. I'll be right outside if you need anything." With that, he left.

Olivia climbed onto the bed and seemed to fall asleep almost instantly. I followed suit, surrendering to the fatigue that had been building up.

As I got up and stretched, I noticed that it was already 7:30 am. "Jesus, I slept for 16 hours?"

The man chuckled. "Yup, you slept soundly until now, so I didn't wake you up."

At that moment I realized that the neighboring bed was empty. Olivia was nowhere to be seen. Anxiety began to creep in. "Where's Olivia?"

The man sat on the empty bed. “She wanted to go for a walk alone.”

I couldn't help but raise my voice at him. “And you let her?! What if something were to happen and we’re not around!”

He dismissively waved his hand. “Relax man, she’ll be fine. I think she just needs some time to come to terms with what’s going on.”

I’ve never been an anxious person, but that has most certainly changed now. We were in uncharted waters, unsure when we would be attacked next. Not only that, these 2 people were all I had as far as friends were concerned.

Was it okay to call them friends though? Maybe comrades would fit better in this case. If our circumstances were different, would we have met to begin with? No, now’s not the time to think about that.

I took a deep breath. “Do you have any idea where she could have gone?”

He looked at me, a hint of assurance in his eyes. “Yea, I’m fairly certain she went to her house. Her family’s house I mean.”

I raised an eyebrow at him, curious. “And how do you know that?”

He grinned. “I trailed her there just to make sure she didn’t get herself into trouble. Alex, you aren’t the only one worried here. It was my fault that pig even made it to school to begin with. I’ll protect you both, promise.”

I was genuinely moved. My impression of this man was constantly shifting. Sometimes he behaved like a child, but in moments like this, he proved himself to be our strongest ally. There were so many things I didn't know about him. I wanted to change that.

I couldn’t help but ask as I put my shoes on. “Alright, I understand. But say, what is your name?”

His eyes lit up with excitement. “Hmm, my name died along with my old life. You can call me whatever you want!”

“Come on man, you know I can’t do that, please tell me your name.”

He struck a dramatic pose. “If you really insist, I’ll allow you to give me a new name!”

“Did you even hear what I just said?” Olivia then came to mind once again.

“You know what? This conversation isn’t over, we’ll talk about this later. For now, show me where Olivia went.”

As we stepped outside, he clapped his hands together. “Alrighty, let’s go then.”

He was still only wearing his track pants. “Are you not going to get dressed?”

“Nope, let’s go!”

He picked me up and carried me in his arms, his laughter filled with mischief. I did not like the feeling of this, not one bit. “Wait, what are you doing?!”

After a swift sprint, he effortlessly leaped onto a nearby rooftop, and from there, he continued to bound from roof to roof. I'd witnessed his unnatural reflexes during the school incident, but at this moment, he seemed superhuman.

To say I was scared shitless would be an understatement. It was more akin to riding the most extreme roller coaster imaginable. As someone who had always been afraid of heights, jumping 10 to 20 meters high into the air played havoc with my heart.

I clung to him tightly, pleading for him to put me down, but he paid no attention, his laughter drowning out my screams. After what felt like ages, we made it to where Olivia’s house supposedly was. It took a few seconds for me to compose myself. The ride had really taken a toll on me.

In our peaceful suburban neighborhood, 7:30 a.m. on a Wednesday morning was usually a quiet time. Our sudden adventure this early in the morning must have stirred up the whole block.

I quivered as I said, “Please don’t do that so suddenly again!”

He put me down. “No promises Alex!” My heart was still racing, pounding in my chest as if it wanted to break free. Similarly, my legs ,which had momentarily turned into jelly during the ride, now felt oddly shaky as I took my first steps on solid ground.

After looking around we saw Olivia sitting on the sidewalk. Her arms wrapped tightly around her knees. It was as if she was trying to disappear into herself. It was clear that something had deeply affected her by the time we reached her.

I settled down beside her. “Olivia, are you alright?”

She was struggling to hold back her tears. "They didn't recognize me, neither Dad nor Mom.” She said to the man. “What you said was true."

A sense of sadness weighed heavy on me. "A part of me still wished it was all just a terrible dream."

"I'm sorry, Olivia. Truly sorry." The man remained silent, his eyes scanning our surroundings.

She looked up at me, her eyes now burning with a mix of anger and sadness. "Alex, let's do it."

I was taken aback. "Do what?"

Her determination was palpable. "Let's take out these monsters. I'm furious right now."

The man put his hands on both our heads. “Sorry to interrupt, but you guys still haven’t eaten breakfast, right? Can’t fight on an empty stomach, so let’s go eat something and then we’ll have a strategy meeting.”

After our meal, the man led us to a police station. “Umm what are we doing here exactly?”

The man glanced back at us. “Archive section.”

Inside the police station, as expected, he slipped through unnoticed. But we couldn't hope for the same luck.

A female officer sitting at the front desk noticed us. “Excuse me, can I help you two?” I was getting a feeling of Deja vu, when the man walked up to the officer and gave her a strong slap. As a result, the officer passed out flat on the floor.

I was surprisingly calm. “Should I even bother asking why?”

He looked up at us with a carefree smile. “Don’t worry she just fainted.” After that, he slapped another 6 officers until we finally reached the archives.

“So, what are we doing here?” Asked Olivia somewhat fed up with his behavior.

The man didn’t reply as he picked up a file and handed it to us. I had never seen a police file before, but despite that, I instantly recognized a familiar face. It was mr. Cameron. I clenched my jaw as images of that day came to mind. Olivia, on the other hand, averted her gaze away from the file.

The man signed, as he took the file from my hands. “This is where I come to find some reports on them. Mr Cameron here, was suspected of killing his wife and the investigation was dropped without even interviewing him. This is what I have been up to, ever since I acquired a lot of free time and unrestricted access.”

Olivia then spoke up. “Why did you draw a sketch of hi- I mean it?

He thought about it for a few seconds. “Drawing is fun! That and also, I don’t have a phone anymore since I don’t really use it.”

There was still something I needed to clarify. “So, wait, that monster had a wife? Or is there something else going on? I also happened to meet mr Cameron a few days before school began and he was perfectly normal.”

“Pigs replace humans, Alex. As far as I can tell they only target humans and even after they replace one, they still continue to hunt like predators. Although I don’t fully understand it myself. After all, they could just distort reality. Why bother mimicking humans? Maybe they liked humans after all?”

Olivia interrupted him and asked. “What’s our next move?

A serious look crossed his face. “The Mall. From what I saw,  it seems that the police have been receiving an increasing number of missing person reports. As you may have guessed, a group of these missing individuals were last seen at the mall and have yet to be found. I had planned to investigate the mall eventually, but Mr. Cameron took priority due to his proximity.”

“Alright then, however there’s still an issue. Olivia and I can’t exactly fight, you know? I don’t want to hold you back when you’re in the middle of a fight.”

I looked at Olivia and we both nodded. As we voiced our concerns, the tension faded from his face, and his features relaxed. “I had a feeling you would say that, Alex.” He opened his duffel bag, revealing the familiar sketchbook and axe, along with some medical supplies and... weapons. A shotgun, a pistol, and even some grenades emerged from the depths of his bag.

We were both speechless, I had expected him to be prepared but not to that extent. “Where did you even get all this?”

The man smiled as if being praised. “I got these from a military base plus some from this station. You know, just in case.”

Olivia was carefully examining the weapons. “What about the axe then?”

“My dad was a lumberjack. He came across this axe one time he was in the woods. It’s very sturdy compared to the usual axes you see. Sharper as well.”

Curiosity overwhelmed me and I reluctantly asked. “Any idea where your father is now?” His expression turned somber. “He’s dead.”

“I’m sorry to hear that. My apologies for bringing it up.” I said, feeling a pang of guilt.

His face remained briefly emotionless. “Nah! Don’t worry about it. That aside, we should get a move on! I’m assuming you’ve never fired a gun before, so I'll teach you the basics.”

Putting aside that awkward exchange, we discussed our strategy and as we left the station, he attempted to pick the both of us up. I stopped and had to practically bully him into using the subway instead.

“Hahaha. You two are a riot.” It was the first time I heard Olivia laugh, ever since the school incident. I hoped that by the end of this, we would all be able to enjoy ourselves like that. Following what felt like an absurdly long ride, we finally reached the mall.

Watching the bustling crowd, memories flooded back from the days when I frequented this place with my friends. The realization that this seemingly ordinary place was about to transform into a battleground felt surreal.

My palms grew clammy, and a sudden tightness gripped my chest, as if my heart had momentarily skipped a beat. Doubts began creeping in. A quick glance at Olivia confirmed that she too was trembling. Just as we approached the entrance, I offered Olivia a reassuring wink and then turned to the man, suggesting, “Since we’re here, we could get you some clothes hm?”

He wasn’t planning on letting that snarky remark go unnoticed. “What’s the matter Alex? Are my superior muscles making you uncomfortable?” He was pretty muscular to be fair, but that was beside the point. Despite that, I could hear Olivia giggling in the background.

“People are looking at us! Even if they forget, the current moment remains embarrassing!” This caused him to start flexing like we were in a bodybuilding competition. For the sake of my mental health, I pretended he didn’t exist.

As we stepped through the mall entrance, the subtle but persistent unease settled over me. Each footfall on the polished floors echoed my growing apprehension. The buzzing crowds and familiar stores that once felt inviting now seemed to loom with an intimidating presence. The lively chatter of shoppers became a distant hum as my focus narrowed, and I couldn't help but cast furtive glances at every corner, every face, searching for any signs of trouble.

Somewhere in this place, a dangerous monster lurked. It could be any of them. It was as if the once-familiar mall had transformed into a labyrinth of uncertainty, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something dangerous awaited us amidst the shops and corridors.

The man gestured upward. “I suggest we head to the highest floor to get a better vantage point.” And so, we rode the escalator up to the third floor, anticipation gnawing at our patience as we waited for who knows what to reveal itself.

After what felt like an eternity, the man's impatience bubbled over. “This is so boring! Can't I just break something? Maybe that will lure it out.”

As much as I shared his frustration, I didn't want to risk drawing unnecessary attention. “Don't stir up trouble. Are you trying to get us kicked out?'

He shot me an exasperated look, like a child trapped in a dull classroom. “Alex, we've been here for two hours! They wouldn’t even notice us anymore!”

Olivia seemed to agree with me. “Let’s wait a bit more and see, okay?”

“Kay.”

We continued to look across the shops and still, nothing was out of the ordinary. Prepared as we were, was it the right call to come here? The man barely knew anything about those things, so even he couldn’t be certain this would play out in our favor.

As I was contemplating whether we should abort the mission, I saw it: A grotesque, 7-meter-tall human figure emerging from one of the shops on the second floor right beneath us. Its emaciated limbs contorted unnaturally as it maneuvered through the oblivious shoppers. The stench of decay trailed in its wake, and its disfigured visage was nothing short of a nightmare.

The creature's brain matter lay partially exposed, framed by tattered flesh and decaying skin that peeled away to reveal patches of raw, exposed bone. Its movements were a grotesque dance, disturbingly graceful for something so utterly horrifying.

Frozen in terror, I watched as the abomination moved among the unsuspecting shoppers, who seemed ignorant to its presence. My heart pounded in my chest, and my breaths came in shallow, panicked gasps. Was this their true form? I thought to myself. This was the threat we had come to confront, and its grotesque appearance was far worse than anything I could have imagined.

Beside me, Olivia clung to my arm, her eyes wide with terror. The man, who had been growing impatient just moments before, now stood utterly still, a wide grin forming on his face. We had found what we were looking for, but whether we were prepared to face this nightmarish creature head-on remained to be seen.

The man pulled us closer, his voice a hushed whisper. “Looks like it hasn't noticed us yet. Alrighty, I'm going in. You guys wait here.” We nodded in silent agreement, our eyes fixed on the approaching horror. After handing me his bag, the man took a few steps back, clutching his axe tightly. With a deep breath, he sprinted forward, moving with an uncanny speed and agility.

In a display that defied the laws of nature, the man ran horizontally along the wall, deftly navigating the space until he was positioned directly above the creature. With a swift and powerful motion, he brought his axe down, driving it through the monster's skull. A deafening scream of agony echoed through the mall as the abomination tumbled backward, crashing down to the first floor.

We watched in awe and horror as the creature lay motionless below. The man wasted no time, relentlessly hacking at the fallen beast until he was satisfied that it posed no further threat. It was a gruesome sight, but there was a sense of grim satisfaction in knowing that this nightmarish creature had been defeated.

Once he had finished, the man raised his blood-stained axe high, his eyes scanning the shocked onlookers as if awaiting their cheering.  Of course, he didn’t get any since nobody was paying attention besides us. It was a chilling reminder of the surreal reality we now found ourselves in. The man had dispatched the monster with remarkable skill and precision, even ensuring it fell in a manner that avoided harming the innocent bystanders below.

I tightened my grip on Olivia's shoulder, determination burning in my eyes. "We can do this. We can beat them." Olivia nodded, her face lighting up with a newfound hope. We exchanged a reassuring glance with the man, who waved at us in return. But his expression suddenly shifted from comfort to sheer panic.

"BEHIND YOU!"

Startled, we spun around, only to find ourselves face to face with two more of those nightmarish abominations. They had seemingly materialized out of nowhere, standing  just a few feet away, their grotesque eyes fixated on us. How had we missed their approach? Had we been so distracted that we failed to notice their presence?

Both of these creatures shared the same eerie base appearance, yet there were unsettling differences: The one on the left appeared unnaturally muscular, while the right one seemed adorned with a grotesque, flowery pattern.

In a matter of seconds, I grabbed Olivia and lunged to the left as a deafening crash reverberated through the entire floor. The sudden burst of adrenaline gave me an unexpected sensation of agility. In that single moment, I felt lighter than a feather.

That fleeting sensation came with a cost, as I soon realized with a searing pain piercing through me. My right arm was gone, torn away by the muscular monster as if it were nothing more than a piece of tender meat. The pain was so overwhelming that coherent thoughts eluded me.

The flowery one, on the other hand, revealed a set of fleshy vines emerging from its hands and back as it charged after us. Olivia desperately tried to stop the bleeding as she realized we couldn't outrun that thing.

Fighting through the pain, I retrieved the pistol I had stashed in my pocket and fired at its eyes. The monster recoiled, and as the other one prepared to join the attack, I felt my wrist ache from the unexpected recoil of the gun. Dizziness overcame me as blood continued to pour from my wound.

I was terrified, unwilling to die, and unwilling to see the others perish. My body refused to obey my commands, no matter how hard I tried. Amidst the chaos, I heard a faint voice.

"Hey... Die."

The man propelled himself at the muscular creature.  In a single, powerful motion, the man used his spare hand to dig his fingers into the beast’s face and rip off the remnants of its decaying facial skin. Following that brutal display, with a swift, brutal kick to its visage, he sent it hurtling down to the second floor. His movements were that of rage, each strike precise and relentless.

Immediately afterward, he turned his attention to the flowery creature's vines, violently slashing at them. Strangely, as he severed them, a curious green dust began to emanate from the wounded spots.

Instinctively, the man swung his axe through the air, creating a violent gust that sent the green dust swirling upward. He then swiftly scooped up both me and Olivia, and we descended to the second floor, putting a considerable distance between us and those monstrous creatures.

Gritting his teeth, the man instructed, “Olivia, please apply pressure to his wound. I'll take care of them.'” Olivia grabbed a bandage from the bag and wrapped it tightly around my torn arm, staunching the flow of blood.

I tried to compose myself in a desperate attempt to calm her down, “You’re really good at this huh?”

Olivia looked at me with teary eyes and replied with a shaky voice. “I-I always wanted to be a nurse. Alex, please don’t move. I’m not going to let you die.” Meanwhile, the man was getting ready to jump back to the third floor, determined to finish off the flowery one.

As if things couldn’t get any worse, as I blinked, something instantly occupied my field of vision. A humanoid figure was looming ominously in between the man and Olivia. Its skin, or what remained of it, was in a state of advanced decay, with patches of rot and exposed muscle tissue.

Standing at the same height as the man, it was bald and with its most unsettling feature being its face, or lack thereof. Instead of normal eyes, it bore two realistic, but unnaturally painted eyes. These painted eyes were vividly red, as if they had been meticulously crafted using crimson dye on a blank canvas.

It was instinctual, almost primal. I couldn't quite comprehend it, but I sensed that this creature belonged to an entirely different league compared to the monsters we had faced thus far.

As soon as the man became aware of it, he swung his axe at it.

***“How intriguing.”***

It was a human voice, yet it resonated directly in my mind. It was as if someone had taken a direct line to my thoughts, bypassing my ears entirely. In the blink of an eye, the creature disappeared and reappeared behind the man. It was holding the man’s left arm and axe.

***“This axe is terribly sharp.  It's no surprise you dispatched so many of us effortlessly. Your speed and durability are nothing to scoff at either. You are most certainly an abnormal human.”***

The man had his eyes wide open as he shortly stared at his missing limb. He quickly composed himself and attempted to punch the creature. “Shut up!”

Before the hit landed however, the man was launched with a tremendous amount of force ,crashing violently into a nearby store on the first floor. The sound of shattering glass and collapsing shelves echoed through the mall. Olivia and I felt despair, how the hell could we beat this thing. The creature slowly turned its grotesque head in our direction.

***“Ah, my apologies, you feel left out don’t you? You are quite exceptional as well, willingly coming to this place to die. Understanding one's place in this world is vital. Failing to do so only brings needless suffering, not just to you but to those you cherish.”***

Behind the creature, the muscular one stood, its cracked skull oozing profusely, and beside it, the flowery one swayed ominously.

***“I’m no longer interested in these two, kill them. The man with the axe is a suitable vessel.”*** The creature hissed before vanishing into thin air.

The two monstrosities charged at us, their twisted forms a horrifying sight. But Olivia, resourceful and determined, had a plan. With quick thinking, she reached into the bag and pulled out a grenade, her hands trembling as she tossed it towards the approaching creatures.

In a daring act of selflessness, she threw herself on top of me, using her body as a shield from the impending explosion. The deafening blast rocked the mall, and the creatures emitted ear-piercing screeches that echoed through the corridor. After what felt like an eternity, the cacophony subsided.

As I looked at Olivia, my heart raced with fear and gratitude. “Olivia please leave me and get out of here.”  I could see her wincing in pain. The explosion had injured her back.

“You said we should live through this together, so that’s what we’re going to do. I’ll patch you up and I’ll go support him. I still have one grenade left after al-“

Before she could finish, a vine snaked out from the smoke and pierced through her abdomen. She coughed up blood as she looked at me with fear on her face. Even in her dire condition, she mustered a weak smile. The cruel vine then tossed her aside, and to our horror, the flowery monstrosity emerged relatively unscathed from the grenade blast.

I let my rage overpower the pain and from the bag, I drew the shotgun. As the creature stepped closer, its mouth near my body, I put the shotgun in its mouth and pulled the trigger. Its brains splattered all over the ceiling, with green fluid coming out instead of normal blood.

I felt my wrist hurt even more after that. I probably sprained it, but I didn’t care. I crawled towards her despite the new source of pain originating from my bruised wrist.

“Olivia... are you o..k?”

Olivia, holding her abdomen tightly, looked at me with a smile still on her face. “That… was kind of cool Alex,

I tried to smile however I had already pushed past my limits. I could only move my hand and barely at that.

Do you know why I’m happy? It’s because this time I didn’t just stand there. At the very least, I finally did something useful right? Despite what happened, I was so happy when we talked 2 days ago. I haven’t had a proper chat with someone in months.”

Her breaths gradually grew shallower. “Ah, I never did thank you did I? For saving my life, twice now.

Don’t say that, please don’t say that. I looked her in the eyes, but the words wouldn’t come out of my mouth. I think she understood me as she continued. “Thank you.. for…saving my life…..” She closed her eyes and stopped breathing. Tears were rolling down my face, making my already blurry vision even worse. Why was this happening? Why…

***“I apologize for underestimating you. You honestly surpassed my expectations, however I have no use for you.”*** I turned around and saw the man was standing behind me, a calm smile on his face. I instantly knew it wasn’t him.

“***This is indeed a most suitable vessel, with this I’ll finally escape this prison. I thank you for coming here. As a reward, I’ll end your suffering.***”

As he drew nearer, I summoned the last of my strength to grip the pistol tightly. It was lighter and more manageable than the shotgun. He held me up by the throat, I could barely breathe.

"***This weapon won't save you. Are you not giving up or simply being stubborn?"***

Tears ran down his face, and I couldn't help but wonder if there was still a part of him buried beneath this torment. Memories of the life they had taken from me flashed before my eyes. They had stolen everything, the people I loved, the future I had envisioned. I couldn't let them win, no matter what.

I suddenly felt a wave of seething energy fill my body, and as I raised the pistol, the creature watched as I pointed it toward my head.

***“What are you-“***

“I promise, I will erase you all from this world.” ***Bang.***

Everything faded to black, and I sent a desperate plea to anyone or anything that would listen: Take me back dammit. Let this work as it did before. When I suddenly opened my eyes to a familiar voice.

“This is so boring! Can't I just break something? Maybe that will lure it out.”
