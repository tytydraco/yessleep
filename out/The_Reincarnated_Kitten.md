Lily had always wanted a Persian kitten. The soft, cloud-like fur and adorable smoosh faces made her fall in love with the breed. When she finally picked up her new kitten, she felt a strange unease, although she couldn’t pinpoint why... Maybe it was the eyes? strikingly human in a way that made her unsettled. She named the kitten Blueberry, for it's blue and white fur.

Although she had cats before, Blueberry was different: He always seemed to be watching and appeared to understand her and the things she said: *(Are you hungry? Let's go in stroller, Kiss time, etc)* As well as was hyper intelligent for a cat, At one point she paid for an xray due to him faking a limp... because he liked her carrying him everywhere the vet said with a chuckle.

As it grew, Lily felt an inexplicable bond, a maternal instinct that deepened with each passing day. Blueberry's eyes, always watching, seemed to understand her moods, her joys, and her sorrows. It was as if Blueberry was not just a pet but a silent, empathetic companion.

Taking a break from work one night, Lily left her laptop open to grab a cup of tea. Upon returning, she found a chilling message typed in her work document that she knew she didn't write: "**CARRY WILSON 7 KENTUCKY."** 

Her blood ran cold. She hadn’t written that. She didn’t know any Carry, and she certainly wasn’t familiar with Kentucky. Trembling, she typed the name into a search engine. Her heart dropped when the results appeared... a seven-year-old girl named Carry Wilson had gone missing from Kentucky and was never found.

Lily brushed it off as some bizarre coincidence. Maybe her mind was playing tricks on her? Maybe it was keyboard slam autocorrect? She shut her laptop and tried to forget about it, but a gnawing unease stayed with her.

Months later, another incident sent shivers down her spine. Blueberry, now a sleek adolescent cat, Paw still on keyboard, As she rushed to pick him up before he ruined her research essay, She noticed at the end of her document was **"BURIED F4M GAZEBOO."** 

Her heart pounded as she tried to decode the message. Family gazebo? She quickly Googled the connection between Carry Wilson and her family. According to google street view, they had a large property with a gazebo in their backyard. 

The overwhelming sense of dread tightened around her, With trembling hands, Emily made an anonymous call to 911, reporting the location of Carry's possible burial under her family's gazebo before quickly hanging up. 

The news broke 3 months later. Carry's body was found, confirming her fears. The child had suffered unimaginable abuse before her death which coroners showed lasted years. The parents came clean when arrested revealing this child never received love in her her life. The newstory was national news for the deep level of trauma this little girl endured.

As time passed, Blueberry's eyes slowly lost their human-like quality, becoming more feline. Lily often wondered about the kitten's past life... if such a thing existed. Was Blueberry a reincarnation? Was Lily the karma of a loving home and family Cary never got? The truth remained elusive, but one thing was clear: in her home, Blueberry would find nothing but love, a stark contrast to the horrors it might have witnessed or endured.

Lily never spoke of the incidents, but she knew, Blueberry, with its now catlike eyes, still watched her with an intensity that spoke of deeper understanding. In her heart, Lily believed she was not just a pet owner but a guardian, giving back love to a soul that had known only pain. And in that quiet, loving exchange, perhaps, there was some measure of redemption for the unspeakable past.
