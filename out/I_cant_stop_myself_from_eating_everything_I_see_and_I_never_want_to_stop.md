I have always been able to eat vast amounts of meat, and my parents had constantly made sure to buy our food by bulk. My condition always leaves me hungry and thin, it had left them without a lot money maintaining all until my adulthood, but things got bad for me around the pandemic. They sadly passed on then, and I was turned out of the family home, and placed by social services into a smaller place.  
  
I received the usually sum, but it still wasn’t enough for me to handle the hunger, and I found other ways to supplement my income, it turns out people like to see someone eat anything online, so I started an Onlyfans page swallowing corks, stones, and a whole basketful of apples. Offering requests, hadn’t always been a favourite aspect of the whole thing, but that’s what brought in the most money for me, but it led to getting stranger requests for me to eat something alive.  
  
It started off with small things like lizards, eels, and small fish. They aren’t as bad as you think, their bones are deeply flexible as you swallow them, and don’t get stuck. Despite my unusual diet, I was underweight, the money I made, bought me enough food as I needed but I wasn’t unable to satisfy my large appetite. I ate any available food from gutters and rubbish heaps but my condition still deteriorated through hunger, and what I turned to when I made content.  
  
My condition finally forced me into a public hospital where I agreed to submit to any procedure that might cure my appetite, and was treated with semaglutide, special diets, antipsychotics, even a psychologist had been in rotation for a while, but I kept on eating more, and having to turn to other parts of the hospital to get a my fill. I know it may seem wrong to some of you, but the door for the pathology department was left open, and most of what I ate, were diseased. I made sure of that. I really did, but the hospital didn’t see it that way. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep me anymore, they told me.  
  
I moved around a lot after that, working in butcheries, a lab assistant, and at meat packing plants. I restarted my Onlyfans account, and it does still help bring a lot of money for me, but it’s hard to put a stop to my habit since my life has gotten around so well. I can’t tell you my whole life in this post, but I have tired to make you understand, right? I always try to get most of my meals from the food I buy, and I don’t eat much from the gutters, rubbish heaps and ethnic restaurants anymore, but there’s just something filling about fresh meat, especially when it’s well aged.  
  
Today is the day I had lost my parents, in what has felt like some decades ago. I just felt a push to visit the gravesite today, and I met an old man tilling the soils around the gravesites. We spoke a for a moment about politics, the weather, and how much the town’s changed lately, but as he struggled to get himself up, he mentioned he was retiring, and the cemetery was likely going to be cleared away for some community housing project. The idea disgusted me, and something popped up in my mind. Its funny typing this up, but I managed to purchase the whole thing!  
  
I have managed to save some money from Onlyfans, and my pitch to the old man left a good impression on him. The place comes with a morgue, and the secluded surrounding I think would be perfect for some late night maintenance of these sites. I was never so social before, but being a cam model, and leaving my parents nest has helped me a lot! I’m looking all over my new business now, my parents site looks a bit dusty, I think it will be the first site I maintain.
