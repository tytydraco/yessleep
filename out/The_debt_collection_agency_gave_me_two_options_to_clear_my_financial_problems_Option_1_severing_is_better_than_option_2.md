There was a fish tank in the waiting room.

I was used to debt collection agencies as a kid. Mom and dad would sit down on old threaded seats with worn eyes and fake smiles, and I would run over to the fish tank, pressing my hands against the glass and peering inside deep blue. 

This fish tank was a lot cleaner than any other I had seen. I was used to filthy water layered with algae and dead fish. 

But this one was definitely looked after. The tank emitted a mesmerising blue light, bathing the room, an influx of tiny silver fish swimming around in maniacal circles. 

Focusing on it was enough to loosen that knot in my gut, but I was still shaky, making my way over to a plastic chair and plonking myself down. The room reminded me of a hospital waiting room. 

Bright yellow walls. But they just reminded me of barf, my gut twisting with nausea. The guy crying in the corner wasn't helping. He was my age, a college kid, dark brown curls buried in his lap, legs pulled to his chest like a child. I found myself wondering *how* this kid has ended up here. His jacket was a designer Levi's, and his shoes looked at least over a hundred dollars. 

But then I remembered what my dad used to tell me. 

Poor people wear rich clothes to feel rich. Even if they can't afford to feed themselves. 

He had been sobbing since I walked in. There was nobody else. Just me and the boy who couldn't seem to stop crying. His body heaved, head shaking. 

Every so often he would reach into his pocket, head still bowed, before his sobs deepened. I thought about asking if he was okay, but every time I leaned forward or cleared my throat, he shrank back into his chair, like a feral animal. There was a flat screen TV playing the same AI generated voice: *"If you're young and healthy, you don't need debt! You need us!"* 

I didn't touch my phone which kept ringing in my pocket. I didn't want to look at a screen. The last time I had, I was slapped in the face with almost 150k of credit card debt. Which wasn't even mine. My parents used my name to pay for things they already couldn't afford, so I was the one being hounded by bailiffs for a debt that they owed. 

I often wondered why they both decided to kill themselves when I was still in school. Aunt Clara said they couldn't take it anymore. I thought it was bringing up a fifteen year old with bailiffs trying to throw down our door every night. They starved most of the time, while I ate scraps. Dad got into deals with bad people, and acted surprised when they came to take everything we had.  

I thought I was what they couldn't take. I complained I didn't have clothes like the kids at school– that my tights had holes in, and my coat was never warm. I was a brat, and I thought they were running away from me. Now I know why. 

Guilt killed my parents. 

Or maybe I'm in denial of the truth. They didn't give a fuck, and left their daughter to drown in their mistakes. 

Every time I thought about my parent's leaving me to their shit, what forced me to work three graveyard shift jobs and still not have enough money to survive—it made me want to follow them. Part of me wished they brought me along in the car, before they poisoned themselves with carbon monoxide, leaving me alone in the world. 

"Caleb Michaels?" a male voice sliced into my thoughts, crackling over the intercom, and across the room, the boy lifted his head, half lidded eyes widening like a deer caught in headlights. Initially, he looked scared, no, terrified. Before his shoulders slumped. He had that same look in his eyes. When Mom and dad went out on a car-ride, promising they were bringing back Chinese food. Giving up. 

Mom had an odd smile on her face when she hugged me goodbye. 

Now I know it was surrendering herself, and giving in. 

The boy had the exact same relent in his eyes, an almost relieved smile prickling on his lips. But I also saw fear, a terror I couldn't understand. I wondered how much he owed. Suddenly, I wanted to know everything about him. If he was going to attempt to clear his debt, and then follow in my parents' footsteps. 

He slowly got to his feet, and dragged himself to a white door, before a blue flicker flashed, an eerie green light scanning his face. I had never seen this type of technology, except in sci-fi movies. "Please say your name in full," a robotic voice drawled. "Please refrain from moving, and stare directly at the red light."

The boy sniffled, swiping at his nose and eyes with the sleeve of his jacket. 

"Caleb Michaels," he said softly, his gaze following the light raking up and down his body. "Caleb Jonas Michaels."

His name sent chills down my spine. Maybe fate had brought me here after all. 

"Jonas," I was speaking out loud before I could stop myself. "That was my dad's name."

"Fascinating." Caleb's gaze was glued to the light. When it flashed again, he surprised me with a choked out laugh. 

"I don't want to do this." 

I nodded slowly. "At least they'll help you," I shrugged in an attempt to reassure him. "I guess? I mean, they have good reviews on their website."

The boy turned to me for the fraction of a second, his expression crumpling with confusion. "What?" He twisted back to the light, his breathing shuddery as a mechanical voice began to count down. *Five.* "I shouldn't be here," he whimpered. "My dad sent me. He said I was doing him a favor. And at the time…I didn't care. I already tried to end it anyway, so why would it matter?

Caleb shot me a sickly smile. "They gave me six months." 

I remember how tense his shoulders were, his arms folded across his chest, fidgeting feet unsure how to stand. "But I don't think I can do this," he screwed up his face. "I'm… blood money."

Caleb Michaels had an interesting, and yet horrifying life. 

"Your dad's debt," I said. "I'm here for mine too."

He scoffed. "Your folks sold you too, huh."

"Well, they're dead, so no. But I did inherit their shit." I swiped my clammy hands on my jeans. "I just hope these guys can relieve me of some of it."

Caleb visibly stiffened. The boy didn't turn around, but his voice broke around the words. "Do you even know *why* you're fucking here?" he whispered. 

"Yeah. Just like you, I'm trying to get help." 

"No," The boy breathed, "No, you don't… you don't understand. If you don't know why you're here, I suggest you get out of here before they call your name." Caleb's words had emphasis on them, and a chill crept its way down my spine. I was already on my feet, before a firm robotic voice told me to sit down. "Ask to go to the bathroom," Caleb said. "There's a window you can jump out of. There's no cameras, but you have to be quick, or they'll add *interest*–" I expected him to keep talking, but he… stopped. 

The light on the door flashed green, then blue, and finally white, before his shoulders slumped. Caleb blinked once, hands dropping to his sides. He had noticeably calmed down, but I wasn't sure the sudden blank look in his eyes was normal. Like a light had been switched off. Before I could speak, the door slipped open. "Mr Michaels, we have been waiting for you. Step forward."

Caleb did, his body trembling. 

"Are you… okay?" I managed to get out. Every time I tried to get up, the polite AI voice barked at me to sit down. 

He didn't answer, didn't even acknowledge my voice. Caleb's expression was flat, and yet there were slight prickles of awareness, his lip twitching, as he strode through the door, which slammed shut behind him. 

His appointment took exactly five and a half minutes, and I spent every second trying and failing to get out of that room. 

I asked to go to the bathroom, and was met with, "We are sorry, Miss Holiday! That is not possible right now. Please wait for your appointment." I was in full panic mode when the door finally slipped open, and Caleb strode out. He caught my attention automatically. I don't know if it was the significant change in his mood. He seemed far more relaxed, his head up, back straight, eyes forward, practically dancing across the waiting room floor. 

There was a band-aid stuck to his right temple, I noticed. Not just that. The boy's jacket was gone, leaving him in a shirt and jeans. His eyes were too wide, lips pulled back into an unsettling grin. 

I could almost mistake his walk for more of a strut. He leapt over the coffee table, landing perfectly, heading over to the door. I watched him, baffled. 

After shooting the door a hesitant look, I half stood up, awaiting the inevitable order to sit down. "Caleb?" I couldn't help myself. 

Something ice cold crept down my spine when his head snapped around, narrowed eyes flicking to me. It wasn't just his behaviour that was different. 

His entire demeanour had  changed. He looked noticeably different, an eerie glow to his skin. His eyes were hollow of emotion. Caleb's smile widened, and I could see the strain in his jaw, a smear of red gathering at the edge of his lips from the stretching. The boy inclined his head, and something… popped. The blood vessels in his eyes. His smile kept going, widening until I had to look away. 

"Hi," I whispered. I don't think the robot watching us would appreciate me screaming. I had to stay calm, but every moment standing in front of this guy I had met five minutes ago— transformed into this… this thing, a screech was clawing at my throat. "Did you manage to sort out your debt?"

"Huhhhh?"

His response confused me, his speech akin to a toddler, and I lifted my head.

Caleb's grin was inhuman. Impossible. His eyes scanned me, before he clicked his fingers. "Oh, that!" Caleb laughed through a mouthful of blood, spitting it out. His skin looked almost haggard, like the flesh of a mask, struggling under the weight of his stretchy smile. 

"Oh yeah, we're all good! No problemo."

I swallowed. "You mean you're okay now?" 

The boy pouted, looking more annoyed than anything. "No offense, but I don't want to talk to you. You're boooooring."

"But... you're okay." That is all I wanted to know. This man could act like a freak all he wanted, I needed to know he was okay. 

Caleb's head lolled to the side like answering me was the equivalent to scaling a cliff. His body was almost limp, like even he was struggling to control it. He straightened up, brushing off his shirt.

Caleb ran his fingers through his hair, spitting blood into his hands to slick it back. "Sort of!" he said, winking. "Catch ya later, kay?" The boy strolled out of the door, and I noticed the lights slightly flicker overhead. I watched him leave, and I could have sworn two shadows followed his manic steps down the hallway. So did the light. 

It didn't stop blinking until he was gone, the doors at the end of the hall swinging open and then slamming shut. 

"Ruby Holiday?"

My name was called, and I had a moment of pure desperation. I was already getting to my feet and inching toward the door. "Ruby Holiday," the voice spoke again. Firmer. I expected the same thing to happen, except the door opened like normal. There was no flash of light, no barking order for me to look straight forward. I think that was why I found myself slowly making my way over. Peering through the door, I was in a state-of-the-art looking room. 

White walls, tiled flooring, and an oldish man sitting on a plush chair.

His smile was friendly. I noticed there was nowhere for me to sit down. The man offered me juice, and I shook my head, standing with my arms folded. 

The door slid shut behind me, and I found myself backing away. 

"Hello, Ruby! Are you here to clear debt with us?" 

I nodded uncertainly, my gaze skimming the room. It was large, and yet far too empty. There was just the man sitting behind a simple desk. 

Outside, a loud crash sounded, and I jumped. Sirens followed. It sounded like a car collision. The man didn't even blink. "Ignore that," he chuckled with an eye roll. "The young ones like to show off."

"Young ones?" 

He nodded. "Yes. They like to cause trouble once fully assimilated." With a sigh, the man opened up his MacBook. 

I glanced at his screen. Caleb's name was still displayed in a folder. "Ruby Holiday," he hummed, clicking the tracking pad. "Ah, yes. Your debt was sold to us two weeks ago," he leaned in, his lip curling, glasses bouncing on his nose. "You owe 150 thousand dollars," the man whistled. "That's a lot for your age!" 

"It's not mine."

The man chuckled. "You are not the only one." He clucked his tongue, his gaze still on the screen. "All right. Based on your initial debt, as well as interest we add on for our sign up fee, I can do a full body severing. Head, torso, legs and organs," he pulled out an iPad, his smile unwavering. "Do you have anyone with you to say goodbye? I suggest you call a parent–" he caught himself. "Sorry. I mean a loved one. We can do this without one, but severed bodies with negative emotion tend to be harder to sell. It's quite sad. Consciousness can hold on. Which isn't good for clients."

I didn't realize I was on my knees, until I could the ice cold marble tiles grazed my legs. My stomach heaved, my thoughts dancing. His words didn't make sense– but after what I had seen with his last customer, part of me did. 

The man peered at me over his laptop. "This is a normal reaction, Miss Holiday. Please take a moment to think," he cleared his throat. "Do make sure to call a loved one, though. I need to make this quick. I have another client in…" he made a point of looking at his watch. "Ten minutes." He stood to his feet, and that was when I threw up, spew dribbling down my mouth and chin. 

"It's quick and clean, Ruby. I can assure you." The man mimed slicing his own throat. "Our state of the art lazors will dismember you in a matter of seconds and clean up any mess. Usually, we donate your filling. However," he peered at his notes. 

"Your organs will be part of the debt! So, ah, yes, yours will be more challenging."

I think time stopped. I didn't look up, until I was sure I wasn't about to be ripped apart. 

When I did eventually look up, I was sitting in a smaller room, my head full of fog. My body did not feel like mine.

I was a stranger inside it,  my head lolling to the left, then the right, my gaze lazily taking in my surroundings. This room was made up of silver. I saw the metal slab of a bed in the corner of my eye, still stained revealing red. The tray of sharp instruments, and the futuristic machines on the ceiling. I tried to move, but his hands held me down. The man was kneeling in front of me, a marker pen in his hand. He had already sliced into my jeans and marked where he would begin cutting. Both of my arms were limp by my sides, black marker pen scribbled over my skin. 

"Miss Holiday, please look at me," he ordered. "Eyes forward, please."

I did, blinking rapidly. Outside, the sky was darker. 

"*This* he gestured to my skin marked for severing. "Is your first option." 

His lips pricked into a smile when my thoughts stirred, and I revelled in the hope of maybe not being sliced apart. 

"Would you like to hear the second?"

I nodded dizzily, my eyes stinging. 

The man straightened up. "What you just witnessed, is the second option." 

*Caleb.*

I must have spoken out loud because he nodded. "We have two options for our customers. We offer either full body severing, or what we call assimilation. They are no different from one another, except instead of being separated from your body all together, you will be…" he shrugged. "I guess we could call it being rewritten. Like a file on a hard drive."

"Caleb." I said, and he nodded grimly. 

"Mr Michaels will be a problem, considering his father failed to let me know of his… condition. I have no doubt I will be receiving a call any day now." he screwed up his face. "But yes. What you say today, was the final stages of full assimilation." he pointed to me. 

"Today, you are having your first consultation," he chuckled. "Well, I already did it while you were sedated. I also began stage one of assimilation, so please do not mind the symptoms. Collapsing, and astral projection is completely normal. We already have four clients interested in assimilating with you, so what I suggest is you look after yourself." he shoved a piece of paper in front of my face. 

"Sign here." 

I did. It took me three times to write it. 

I was just happy with not being cut apart. 

He nodded at me to leave. "I will see you in three days when you enter the second stage," his lips quirked into a smile. "Please take care of the body now, since it is owned by us. No binge eating, drugs, drinking, and refrain from intercourse. It can… *disturb* the process. You must be gentle. No sudden movements. I also advise against driving heavy machinery."

His voice was following me out of the door, when I stumbled back into his office, and then through the door into the waiting room. "Oh, and if you do not return, we will come and get you." 

When the door slammed behind me, he was waving. 

I was screaming. 

Last night, I spent the night with a guy I met from college. 

I had three pizzas, washed down with enough cocktails to send me into orbit.

Should I have let them take me apart there and then? 

It would be better than waiting to die. 

Not even die. 

Be **Rewritten.**

I have my second consultation on Monday. I need to destroy my body before they take it away from me. 

Before they take me away.
