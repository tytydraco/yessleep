Haha I bet that title makes you all nervous.  Don't worry, I'm not talking about my rules.  I'm talking about the campus's rules.  Like the ones about trespassing.

I was packing my backpack at the end of class when Professor Monotone called my name and asked if he could talk to me for a moment.  In his office.  Which obviously meant that it had to do with the inhuman, because I couldn’t think of any other reason to hold a conversation in private like that, so of course I agreed.  My study group could wait.  I texted them I wasn’t going to make it on the way to his office, which I’m sure was disappointing because the study group is more like me tutoring them for an hour.

Actually a pretty good way to make sure you understand the material yourself, I’m finding.

“I wanted to talk to you because I don’t want to see your future here at the college impacted,” he began as soon as the office door was closed and I was sitting down.

Which is a hell of a way to start.  You all know I’m an anxious person.  We’re lucky that I didn’t keel over dead right then and there.  Especially since he said all that in a particularly somber tone with just enough uncomfortableness to indicate that he didn’t want to be having this conversation either.

So I sat there, stunned, like a deer in the headlights right before being struck by a semi.  Inside, my mind was concocting a dozen scenarios of what could possibly be so wrong as to get me expelled from the university - because sure, that’s what this was about, what else could be so serious that it would merit an earnest discussion about my future here?

And let’s be real - I’ve probably done some things by now that could get me expelled.  Mostly trespassing, but in the moment, the first thing that came to mind was how I killed the flickering man.  Surely that was why he wanted to talk to me.  The university knew I was responsible and was coming for me.

“I know you’re determined to figure out the… strange… things happening on campus,” he continued, “but you need to be a little more judicious about going into places you don’t belong.”

Okay.  Trespassing it was.  My heart resumed beating, albeit at about four times its normal rate.

“Sorry,” I said.  “I’ll stay out of the graveyard.  It was kind of an emergency last time, though.”

Probably shouldn’t have tried to make excuses.  That rarely goes over well.  But he ignored all that and furrowed his brow in confusion.

“Graveyard?” he said.  “They don’t go after people that get into the graveyard unless they’re committing vandalism.  No, I’m worried about the power plant.”

Wait, what?

While I sat there in mute confusion, he elaborated that he saw me sneaking inside the other day.  He wasn’t sure where I got a key or if I knew how to pick locks, but that was irrelevant, I really shouldn’t be in there.  The university was a bit more touchy about students trespassing in that building than others.

“I don’t go anywhere near the power plant,” I protested, when he was done.  “Are you sure it was me?”

Like.  Trauma.  I’m not a fan of the place.  Professor Monotone just scratched his thinning hair thoughtfully and reiterated that yes, he was pretty certain it was me.

“Could campus be doing something weird?” I persisted.  “Like - are you seeing a - a ghost vision of me?  Or some other kind of double?  I don’t want to ever go near that place, there’s something wrong with it, and it scares me.”

I was talking way too fast.  He listened solemnly and it was actually kind of nice to talk to a professor that didn’t assume it was all in my head and try to get me into therapy.  Therapy DID help I don’t want to downplay that, but ALSO it’s nice to just have someone listen and be like yes, being afraid of a certain building is a completely valid emotional response to have because this campus is infested with monsters.

He might have been wrong, he said.  It was from a distance.  Then he quickly changed the topic to whether I was interested in the summer internship thing and I said I was.  He said he’d write a letter of recommendation but I needed to get him my resume.  I’ve actually never written a resume before, I got my job back home because it’s a small town and everyone knows everyone.  I’ve got an appointment with the job center for next week to get help writing a resume.  I feel like this is a resource I should have learned about much earlier in my college career than this.  Oh well.  Better late than never.

Then, once the mundane topics were covered and we were safely no longer talking about the power plant, I decided to ask what Professor Monotone knew about the university president.  Turns out it wasn’t as risky a question as I expected, as he doesn’t know much.  Seems alright, he said.  Doesn’t make a lot of public or even private appearances, but things are generally well-run around here.

“And the previous president?” I asked.  “Do you know anything about him?”

“Not really,” he finally said.  “We haven’t had any other president while I’ve been working here.  Is this something I should look into?”

I was sorely tempted.  He had resources I didn’t and from the way he asked, from the way he lowered his voice and the solemn intensity of his gaze, I knew that he was also asking - is this something unnatural I should be concerned about?

“It’s… not very safe,” I replied, my voice similarly soft.  “Do you remember what happened to the folklore professor last year?”

“Ah.  Yes.  That.  There was an official explanation given but I heard rumors otherwise.  I’ll just… proceed with caution, hmm?”

I hesitated for a moment.  Time to ask the really big question.

“Have they said anything about the current president being dead?” I asked.

I stg his eyebrows about shot off the top of his head.  So no.  They haven’t said anything yet.  

That pretty much wrapped up the conversation.  He had a potentially dead president to worry about and I had the power plant on my mind.  Obviously I did the smart thing.  I went straight back to my apartment to enlist the help of my trusty friends that keep me grounded and help me think of alternatives that aren’t reckless and risky.  Hahah jk I went to the power plant.

As always, I have excuses.  And I’m sure you’re all getting tired of hearing them and seeing me choose things that I know I shouldn’t do.  But there’s this wild feeling in my chest, like a soda can that’s just fallen down a flight of stairs, and it's driving me forward.  Telling me to run and never stop, just run until I collapse because this is all too much, the enormity of my uncertain future and my uncertain survival is like watching the earth all around me crumble into the abyss and all I can do is keep moving before it collapses under my feet.

So yeah.  I’m not going to tell you my reasons for going alone.  I don’t fully understand them myself.

Though to be fair, I wasn’t planning on going inside.  Not until I got there and saw one of the doors near the loading dock hanging open by a foot.

A couple options ran through my head.  The first one, the one that made my heart feel like it’d been encased in ice, was that the Folklore Society was following in Patricia’s footsteps.  Which was ridiculous, according to Maria they hadn’t talked about the power plant at all, and she’d been attending their meetings and watching their discord channel for specifically that.  I hastily shoved that one aside, before I dwelled on it too long and dredged up certain things that I keep stored in the corner of my mind, out of sight, where I don’t have to acknowledge they exist.

The more reasonable alternatives were that someone else, perhaps my look-alike, was sneaking inside.  Or someone from the university with legitimate business was inside and forgot to shut the door behind them.  I decided to play the role of the good student, noticing a door was open that shouldn’t be, and checking to make sure everything was okay.  I stuck my head inside and called out, asking if anyone was in here, saying that I saw the door was open and if that was a mistake.

Nothing.  My eyes quickly adjusted to the gloomy interior and my heart sank even further.  This door opened to a stairwell.  They could have gone further inside the building, I suppose, but that door was shut and when I checked the handle it was locked.  Then, if it wasn’t a forgetful employee, the person probably took the stairs.

To the basement.

I was about to turn around and leave because this really wasn’t a problem I had any reason to be sticking my nose into, but then I thought I saw something.  A shadow along the stairwell wall.  Someone going down the stairs, just out of sight.  There was a strange glint too, like the flash of light reflecting off something shiny.  It was there for only a moment and then it was gone.

I think being an overachiever is working against me because I apparently can’t leave things half-done.  I went after them, because obviously I had to, right?  I can’t pass up extra credit even when I’m passing the class and I apparently can’t walk away when someone is walking into danger right in front of me.

I hurried down the stairs to where the door to the basement hung open.  It took me a moment of searching to find the person I was pursuing.  I scanned the vast, dark room frantically, wondering why I couldn’t find them, they weren’t that far ahead of me, but I didn’t see any movement.  I’d almost convinced myself that I was merely seeing things when my gaze was drawn, reluctantly, to that shallow pool of endless water at the far end of the room.

There was someone kneeling by the pool of black water.

No.  No no no no no.  I walked towards them, moving briskly, then breaking into a run, driven by the growing panic in my chest.  All I could think of was those hands I held, pulling with all of my might, long after they went still.  I couldn’t do that again.  I couldn’t watch the water take someone else.

“Hey!” I called as I approached.  “Hey, get away from that!  It’s not safe.”

I was mere feet away when they raised their head and turned to look at me.  I had a moment of realization, the glint of the faint light in the basement off something metal.

Then the stabbed student lunged at me.  His hand closed on the front of my shirt and then the world tumbled around me, I was falling, skidding along the ground to come to a stop on my back, staring up at the face hidden under the shimmering glint of thousands of safety pins.  I put a hand back to push myself up and felt it slip, felt my fingers touch something wet and cold as ice.

I’d slid to a stop right against the edge of the pool.

Frantically, nearly blind with terror, I flipped over and began to get up as quickly as I could.  I was on one knee when a hand gripped the back of my head.

And began to push.  

James was relentlessly strong.  My foot slipped on the concrete, I almost went head-first into the water, only saving myself with my hands on the edge of the pool, the gritty ground digging into my palms.  And all I could think of was why here, why was he here?  He couldn’t leave the geology building with me, so why here?

I stared down into the water.  My reflection stared up at me, my eyes wide with fear.  And behind me was James, his face obscured by my own so that in my reflection, it looked like it was my face the safety pins were stabbed into.

I didn’t dare try to twist or turn out of their grip, for fear of losing what precarious leverage I had, my hands planted firmly on the edge of the pool, trying to lock my arms so that they couldn’t shove my face any closer to the water.  My breath came in short, panicked gasps.  Could I kick him?  Would that work on a ghost?

Of course it would work.  His hand was solid on the back of my head.

I rolled onto my back, kicking his legs as I did.  His grip switched from the back of my head to around my throat.  I tried to find purchase around his wrist, knocking dozens of safety pins out of their flesh in the process.  They clattered on the ground around me, the metal against cement sounding like the faint chime of bells.  I found cold, dead flesh underneath.  Wrapped my fingers around it, sucking in one deep breath to give me the strength I needed next.  The ghost’s grip was strong, pressing down on my throat, but it wasn’t fully cutting off my ability to breath.  Like he wasn’t trying to kill me.  But I could feel the presence of the pool beneath my head, I could feel the weight of the water as it soaked into my hair.  I felt my neck slowly bending backwards under the pressure, inching ever closer to the water.

I twisted my body around, using the ghost’s arms as leverage.  I pulled him towards the pull and pushed myself away.

I admit I expected more resistance.  We were locked in a struggle, after all, and I expected to maybe move myself maybe a half foot away from the pool and no further.  Just enough to give myself a bit more space to fight back in.

James went limp.  He weighed almost nothing at all.  And I, in shock and surprise, threw him over me and into the water.

I screamed.  I scrambled to my feet, covering my hands with my mouth and sucking in sharp, panicked gasps.  Before me was the pool of water, black, devoid of reflection, and utterly flat.  Still.  Not a ripple in sight.  The stabbed student was just… gone.

DID I KILL HIM!?!

I want to throw up just thinking about it.  That’s not what I wanted.  James was… scary.  Intimidating, and maybe a little bit dangerous.  But I think he was also a victim of this damn university and I -

I don’t like killing these things.  They’re alive.  They’re sentient.  They’re not like us, they don’t experience emotions like us, but they have wants and desires, and yes they feed on us, but I don’t think I can be the person to kill them.  I don’t think that’s me.  Maybe that makes me a coward, maybe I’m too sensitive, but killing the flickering man?  That’s not me.  I realize that now.

Would I repeat my decision to kill him if I could do it all over again?  Yes, we were locked in a me or him situation and even with the gift of hindsight, I see no escape from that.  Too many forces outside of my ability to control had conspired against me.  The devil, for one, trapping me on campus.  The flickering man, the other, for clinging so tightly to whatever vision necessitated my removal.  But it doesn’t mean I’m going to keep choosing that going forward, if there is any alternative.

We like to think that everyone should be capable of fighting and killing anything that threatens us, but the reality is that most people are going to be like me.  Society would fall apart if we didn’t hesitate to take a life.  And if you think I’m being weak or shirking my responsibility here: hunt them yourself.

I won’t be the executioner around campus.  Find someone else to be that kind of hero.

Yet there I was, staring at that blank pool of water and wondering if I’d just fed James to the entity responsible for him being trapped here as a ghost.

I think it’s all connected.  The traveling river.  The pool in the basement.  The tree.  And whatever rules over the inhumans.  I don’t know how or what it is or what it wants, but I feel in my gut that it’s all connected.

I stayed there long enough for my heart to stop trying to claw its way out of my body before I realized where I was and how unsettled I felt, staring at the water, like the world was pressing in close around me so tight that I couldn’t breath.  So I turned and ran.  Yes.  Literally ran, too afraid to look back, until I was outside of the power plant and long gone.

I was still hyped up on adrenaline I guess, because then I did something far bolder than I normally would.  I texted Grayson and told him that we need to talk or our friendship wouldn’t survive.  That I could understand him needing space and even being curt with me, but that it couldn’t continue indefinitely.

And that I knew what it was like to lose a father.  That you have to keep living, even while it hurts, because that pain never goes away.  It just changes shape, but it’s always there, like a pebble in your shoe.

He’s going to come over tomorrow.  I’m making sure to write all of this up before then.

In case I forget.

In the meantime, I did tell Cassie about a look-alike visiting the power plant.  We’ve got a plan.  I came up with this idea.  I’m rather proud of myself.

We bought a camera.  One of those motion activated ones that hooks up to your smartphone.  It also has night vision.  Then we snuck into the power plant.  I stayed outside and kept watch while Maria and Cassie went inside and found a place to leave it.  Somewhere we had a clear view of the pool of water in the basement, but where I or anyone else wouldn’t easily see it.

We’re going to figure out exactly what’s going on.

Also, yes, I’m fully aware of the irony of Professor Monotone telling me to stay away from the power plant and then we immediately trespass twice in a twenty-four [hour](https://alderrayne.com/) [period](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/).
