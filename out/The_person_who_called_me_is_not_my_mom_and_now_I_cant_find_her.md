Last Wednesday at 6 a.m., I got a WhatsApp message from my mom, reminding me 
about her biyearly doctor’s appointment. She needed to renew her prescriptions, and 
since she's 80 and doesn’t drive anymore, I always take her. Living in Kansas while she 
resides in Mississippi meant I had to make a long 14-hour drive to get there, so I planned 
to leave the next day, turning it into a weekend visit.

 
My wife had everything arranged in advance, so she could join me with our kids, Amy 
and Earl. We thought it’d be a good chance for them to visit their grandparents. Plus, 
while mom was at her check-up, I planned to visit my dad who lived in the same town. 
We left early Thursday morning and arrived at my mom's place around 8 p.m. that 
evening. We were all tired but managed to exchange some quick hellos before heading 
to the guesthouse to crash. 


The next few days went by in a typical family visit blur—catching up, dealing with the 
kids, and for me, trying to stay on top of work with back-to-back Zoom meetings on 
Friday. 


Saturday was a bit strained; a visit to my dad typically ended with him and his wife 
asking me for money, which always put me in an awkward spot. But Sunday brought a 
new level of discomfort. At church, the community was buzzing about several recent 
and mysterious disappearances. It seemed like everyone knew someone who had 
vanished without a trace—friends from school, local shop owners, entire families gone 
overnight. 

It was unsettling, especially with so little media attention. I couldn’t understand why I was only finding out now. 

Monday morning, I drove my mom to the hospital. As she got out of the car, I said, "Call 
me when you're finished so I can fetch you." Then I headed to my dad’s place to kill 
some time. 

Hours passed without any word from her. Concern crept in, but just as I 
decided to call her, her number lit up my phone. However, the voice on the other endwasn’t hers. It sounded like a young woman, claiming to be my mom, saying she was 
fine but they were keeping her a few days for some heart issues. Then, suddenly, the call 
cut out

Frantic, I tried calling back repeatedly but only got voicemail. My dad and his wife 
seemed oddly unconcerned, which only added to my anxiety. When my wife returned 
from visiting her parents, I was pale and shaking. We decided to call the hospital 
directly. I finally got through after multiple attempts, only to hear the receptionist 
confirm that my mom never had an appointment that day. In fact, they hadn’t seen her 
in over eight months. 

Panicking, I rushed to the hospital, running through the halls, checking every ward—she 
wasn’t there. I drove back to her house; it was locked up, undisturbed, as if she hadn't 
been there that morning. It was like she had vanished into thin air. 

The police got involved, but like the others who had disappeared, there was no trace of 
her. The town was fraught with whispered theories of doppelgangers—perfect imitations 
of loved ones appearing right before each disappearance, only adding layers to the 
mystery. 

As the search continued, the reality of the situation grew heavier and the town of 
Merittsville, Mississippi became a place marked by whispers and shadows. No one new 
moved in; some moved away. The dread was palpable, hanging over us like a persistent 
fog. 

Months have passed now, and the mystery remains as dense as ever. I’m reaching out 
through this story, hoping someone might have seen something, might know something 
about what’s happening here in Merittsville. If you have any information, any at all, 
please help us. And if you live here or are just passing through, please be careful. People 
have disappeared without a trace, and we are all left wondering if we might be next.
