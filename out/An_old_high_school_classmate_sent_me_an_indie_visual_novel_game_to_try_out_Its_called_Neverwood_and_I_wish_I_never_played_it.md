The email came through when I was curled up in bed mindlessly scrolling through my phone. It popped up on my notifications first, and then my laptop pinged. Initially, I ignored it. It looked like one of those frustrating spam emails insisting I  had won the latest iPhone model, with the subject just reading, “Read this!!!”  I did grow curious when I saw the name though. Eli.

High school Eli. The weird kid who was obsessed with Fortnite for our entire high school career – Eli. It had been almost four years since we had graduated and I hadn’t spoken to him. Since we were the class of 2020, we didn’t have a graduation or any kind of celebration, not even a prom. I was a high school senior, blinked, and then I was a twenty-one-year-old college student. Eli wasn’t really a friend. 

I wouldn’t class him as someone who had kept in touch. So, it was kind of weird that he was sending me an email out of the blue. Still, though, I was intrigued. The last I heard about him was a screenshot I’d seen on a friend’s story indicating he’d gotten his dream job.  Lucky him. Eli was one of the smartest guys in our class, so I wasn’t really surprised. Sitting up in bed, I dragged my laptop onto my knee, opened it up, and clicked onto my mostly empty Gmail inbox which was nothing but Uber Eats spam and rejections from jobs I’d applied to. 

Eli’s email was sitting on the top with no subject, just a line of exclamation marks which was very Eli. *“Hey, Gabby, long time no see! Do you remember when we used to play visual novel games during study hall?”* He started off the email like he was sharing precious memories at our high school anniversary, though it was strangely comforting.  I did remember. I was obsessed with visual novel games as a teenager.

The Persona games were a particular favorite.

Those games were my crack. I vaguely remember sitting in the library playing it until my friends had to physically drag me away from my PSP.  I smiled at the memory. Good times. However, I didn’t remember Eli being with me. 

It was always just me or my own close circle of friends. But hey, I figured my memory was bad.  It wasn’t completely out of the realm of possibility that he’d joined us once or twice since he too was really into games. I skimmed through the email, highlighting lines of text, my fingers fidgety. 

*“Well, I currently work as a games designer at an indie company, and I figured you might like this! It’s our newest project and it’s still in early development, though the game itself and the story are finished! Why don’t you check it out before it goes live on Steam early next year? We’re trying to send early access to some well-known streamers, but it’s taking a while : ) If I remember correctly, you’re into this sort of thing, right? Neverwood is completely up your alley.”*

Underneath the initial paragraph was a link, and intrigued, I clicked on it and read the rest of the email while another window—what looked like a downloading wizard-- popped up. 

*“Let me know what you think! I spent two years on this game so I would appreciate your feedback! (If I had to describe it, I would say it's Persona but more slice-of-life lol. There’s a school setting, and it focuses on making attachments, so no superpowers or demons ;)”* I rolled my eyes at that.

He hadn’t changed.

I still inwardly winced at old texts he used to send our friend group, just endless winky faces, and sexual innuendos. Eli was a good guy though. 

I mean, I think he was. 

I can’t say I remembered much of him, only that he’d sometimes be in our topic of conversation. But I was still excited to check out his game. 

I loaded up the downloading wizard which went through the specs I needed to play the game, and then the usual terms and conditions that I automatically skipped through. I could see some of the imagery in the background for the game. It was a window looking out into a sky filled with stars with a crescent moon poking out. I don’t know why I expected something similar to Stardew Valley, though I was pleasantly surprised. 

The art looked to all be hand drawn and there were no pixels in sight. It was cozy.  It reminded me of Welcome to Nightvale. The game was easy to download. It took maybe five minutes of staring at a rapidly changing number skipping from 10% to 50% and then back to 3% for the game to finally load up. It was surprisingly well made. 

The game started with an almost cinematic scene involving a first-person point of view of a car ride. There was no voice acting, only text boxes popping up in varying shades of purple—which I thought was a nice touch. 

I was introduced to eighteen-year-old Maddy, a wallflower, coming back home after a summer away at camp. 

Driving through an idealistic-looking town, the animation was smooth and there were no glitches or lag. The whole town of Neverwood was put on display in several flashes framed in a photographic collage and polaroids pinned to Maddie’s bedroom walls. 

I figured these were all playable locations in the game. I saw a diner, a coffee shop, and a school. The music was what I can only describe as Lofi while other characters were introduced in a series of cryptic texts and characters blurred out in the late setting sun’s glow. 

Maddy herself was frowning at a photo of herself and a guy, whose face was blocked by her finger. Again, whoever did the art for this game was talented. 

The smooth colors blending with the interface made it feel cosy and warm. 

These people looked… real. Sure, I could see that they were hand-drawn sprites and had clearly had a lot of thought and passion put into them. 

But they looked and acted like real people. The animation was flawless. Eli and his colleagues had definitely taken inspiration from Life is Strange.

Immediately, the game’s visuals drew me in, almost cyberpunk colors, vivid reds, and purples blurring together in the vaporwave of traffic outside the car. 

I got the basic story through the narrative in the scene. In a written monologue and through snapshots of texts being left on read, and phone calls that she had missed—Maddy was going to actually try in her senior year. 

She already had friends but had never tried with them, always backing out of plans or making excuses. The animation ended with her lying in her bed, and I loved the way it was decorated just like I would have mine. It was very nostalgic, especially for a student who had lost her late teen years to a virus. 

Maddy was lying on her bed staring at the sky and acknowledging that she wanted to see the stars for real—and go stargazing with her friends she pushed away—when a notification popped up on her phone from one of the blurry faces in the polaroid montage. There was a heart emoji next to his name.

“You up?”

The text box popped up with her thoughts, and the interface lit up. 

I had to click on something glowing behind her—another photograph. This time I could see the face, a smiling brunette with freckles. The art was beautiful, even for other characters. 

I could see the work that had been put into making this kid look as realistic and relatable as possible. Penn’s interests were highlighted through more pictures sticking on the wall. He was on the school’s hockey team, had an affinity for true crime, and was the one behind the camera in most of Maddy’s photos. 

The game required me to scroll through the texts sent between the two characters, which was mostly the character of Penn trying and failing to get her to hang out. The two of them had been friends since they were little kids, and according to Maddy, they were destined together since their moms were best friends. I found myself sucked into both the game and their relationship, with other characters being introduced as I navigated the tutorial and town. But there was something about the childhood friends-to-lovers trope that I loved. 

According to the tutorial, I was required to make as many friends as possible, as well as build a relationship with my chosen character while also solving a mini background mystery (**who gave the entire senior class food poisoning?)** 

My options were: Pen, the childhood best friend whom the game seemed to already be pushing through its colorful narrative. I had already made my decision when he turned up at her door to offer breakfast cupcakes and ask if she wanted a ride to school. 

Then there was Violet, a wannabe reporter in Maddy’s classes who was investigating the food poisoning mystery, and Jude, an estranged member of the friend group who worked at the coffee shop and spoke fluent sarcasm. (If you went to the counter straight away, his sprite wouldn’t pop up for a while, until he finally appeared holding a coffee with the same text box popping up:

**“Aren’t you tired of stalking me?”**

If you clicked on him several times (I was impatient since he had information on the last person seen inside the school kitchen the night before the food poisoning incident) he would disappear completely and end up in the town square as an NPC until you left, and then he would pop back up again. 

I think that was a glitch, so I waited until the next morning at school to ask him about it. So initially, I admit I got addicted to this game. I ended up building relationships with all three characters and growing indecisive about who I wanted my MC to be with. I solved the mystery pretty easily. It turned out to be one of the guys on the football team playing a prank. I spent a whole night in real-time sneaking around the school with Violet and getting to know her story a little better. 

She and Violet had a fight at the start of summer, which ended in Maddy going to camp and leaving her on read. The game seemed to be implying that maybe the two of them were a thing and broke up because of Violet’s family. 

Violet didn’t fully reveal their story until the two had solved the food poisoning mystery. Yes, they were a thing—and yes, just like I thought, Violet’s family weren’t exactly supportive. So, my main character was bisexual and in love with her best friends. I got an award for solving the mystery in record time, and Violet gave me a present, a bag of diamonds I could spend in the mall which I couldn’t interact with yet. 

After solving the mystery with Violet and playing a pretty fun mini-game that involved catching the culprit by throwing watermelons at him—the game took me back to the school where I presumed the next part of the story would begin. I had been playing non-stop for two days, only pausing for work and eating. So, I took a break. 

I searched for the game online, but there was no mention of it. 

Curious, I went on Twitch to see if Eli had managed to convince some streamers to play it, but no such luck. Last night, I had several hours to kill, so I hopped back onto Neverwood—only to get Penn straight in my face the second I’d loaded back to my last saving point, which was outside the school. His sprite was a little bigger than normal, slightly overlapping the text box at the bottom of the screen.

“**Where did you go?”** Penn folded his arms. “Maddy, I’ve been waiting for you. We were supposed to go to the movies.”

Were we?

I had to think back, a little disoriented and foggy-brained from work. 

Oh, yeah, I had movie tickets in my inventory. I’d picked them up behind a trash can in the town square, only to get a snide comment from Jude, who was several feet away. I was kind of out of it when I played through his character story, but basically, he had drifted from the friend group when his mom got diagnosed with cancer and pushed them all away. He admitted he regretted it and he and Maddy shared a hug—which I thought was cute. 

I figured Jude’s character would be easier to talk to and more in line with the main story instead of thrown to the side, but apparently not. 

But his comment confused me. I think it was one of the reasons why I decided to take a break. “You’re not supposed to be here.” His character said and continued to say it every time I clicked on him for answers.

In my haste to take a break from this game and these characters,  I had completely forgotten about the movie tickets.

I had three options to choose from to answer him.

**Oops, sorry! I totally forgot!**

**Yeah, I’m not really in the mood for the movies. How about a rain check?**

**I hear they’re playing that new superhero movie! We should go see it!**

I picked the third option and the two of them wandered into the movie theatre. I didn’t see what went on inside. It just came up with: “Penn and I had a great time watching Monster Sequel 2!!”

I expected Penn’s character story to start after. And it did. Kind of. I was drip-fed information on his and Maddy’s past, as well as his rocky friendship with Jude. But when the game started to get into the meat of his story, and I was getting invested in the two’s friendship, Penn’s sprite… blinked. If I had been focusing on the text box on the screen where the character was pouring his heart out to Maddy, I wouldn’t have noticed. 

But instead, I was stupidly counting the number of freckles on his cheek. I don’t think I have ever experienced something as uncanny and strange as a video game character suddenly blinking out of nowhere. It wasn’t the usual blink of a character animation—which was what I was used to. 

No, this was a slow blink, and I could almost mistake his expression for sudden confusion. The rapid-flowing text that he had been speaking suddenly stopped and disappeared completely, followed by three ellipses. 

**"..."**

I was frowning at my options at the bottom, which were sympathizing with him over his and Jude’s friendship break up when his sprite flashed out of existence leaving me alone outside the movie theatre. The game seemed to continue as normal. “**You had a great conversation with Penn!” The text box popped up. 

**“Why don’t you call him and ask for a second date?”**

The cellphone icon at the top of the screen was flashing, but when I clicked on it, nothing happened. Now, I was playing this at 2am. I don’t think these glitches would have affected me if I was playing in the daylight. I headed to the school to see if I could find someone to talk to, but once my character had popped up in the school’s main hallway, the Lofi music playing in the background stopped. 

I thought it was the game itself, but when I clicked on a locker to pick up a bag of diamonds, the sound effect of the locker opening and closing was still there.

So, at this point, I was considering restarting the game. But I found myself hovering my cursor over the classroom doors I could interact with.

The main classroom, which most of the story had taken place inside, was usually unplayable during character stories—and I was pretty sure I was playing Penn’s. Still though, when I clicked on it, I was let in. The classroom popped up as usual, and I had apparently walked into a conversation I did not start. Violet, Penn, and Jude’s default sprites were already on the screen. Penn seemed to be the main speaker, with his text box flashing up every few seconds, but his words were going too fast for me to read. 

His usual expression was a warm smile, but this time he was scowling. 

While Jude and Violet looked… amused. 

I was sure I had never seen Jude smile or even smirk. He always looked annoyed, while Violet’s smile was always cheery with her sometimes flashing a heart with her hands. 

These expressions were different, though I couldn’t explain why. These fictional characters weren’t real, and yet somehow they were so much more expressive in this classroom, lips curled with amusement, eyes shining. 

The two of them appeared to be listening to Penn’s rant that was getting progressively harder to make out.

So, I took a screenshot and managed to get at least some of it.

**“Why can’t you just LISTEN TO ME?”**

His sprite was going crazy, exprsisons flickering from happy, to sad, to annoyed. 

I took another, though this one was kind of blurry. **“The SAME day OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AREN’T YOU TIRED? VIOLET, YOU—”**

I could feel my stomach twisting itself into knots.

**“—SO MANY TIMES, AND IT’S LIKE WE’RE STUCK. WE’RE STUCK RELIVING THIS SAME DAY, THIS SAME WEEK, THIS SAME YEAR, AND I’M SCARED BECAUSE YOU GUYS LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. LIKE I’M CRAZY. AND I’M NOT [FUCKING] CRAZY, I’M TELLING YOU WE—”**

I stopped taking snapshots when the text stopped flowing, and this time Penn’s sprite turned directly towards me, and this time I did see it. I saw his expression twist into disgust, his lip curling. And it was so human, so normal, like I was staring at a living, breathing human being through that animation. I almost closed the laptop, but part of me wanted him to continue.

**“What the [FUCK] are you doing here?”**

His curse words appeared in bolded gibberish I could almost make out.

Penn’s sprite overlapped the text again. **“Shouldn’t you be playing mini-games?”** He said. **“Leave.”** The character told me.

Me.

Not Maddy, the game’s protagonist.

Me.

The player.

I had no way to communicate back because there was no option to. When I was staring stupidly at my screen, he turned back to the others.

**“Please.”** The text popped up again, and his eyes were suddenly far too human, too haunted. “I know I sound crazy—”

**“Yeah.”** Jude’s sprite came up, mid eye-roll. This time he was wearing his coffee shop apron, which was either a glitch or something else. Just like Penn, he was expressive too, a lot more smiley than usual. **“Yeah, you do. What exactly are you trying to tell us?”**

**“You heard him,”** Violet’s sprite was grinning. **“He says we’re video game characters! Which is a good one!”**She turned to look directly at me, her head cocking to her side in one swift burst of animation. **“Sooo, that would mean every choice I make is someone else’s?”** The desk suddenly flipped over next to her, and her smile widened. **“False! Because I just used my own free will to kick that desk over. So, in conclusion, Penn is like, totally losing his mind, and we should get him to the town doctor.”**

**“Agreed.”** Jude’s sprite had frozen mid rolling his eyes, which shouldn’t have freaked me out as much as it did. “I knew he was going to lose it at some point, but not in high school.”

**“WaIT!”**

The two of them left the classroom and I snapped out of my trance and started to close my laptop, my head spinning.

Eli was… quite the designer.

If he could create a game as meta as this, he was definitely going to make it in the industry. I was sure Neverwood would be a success. However, I definitely was not a fan of the 4th wall breaking. The whole thing freaked me out. There was uncanny valley and there was fourth wall breaking, fictional characters acknowledging your existence was… something else. I was ready to exit the game when Penn’s sprite jumped over the text box.

**“Please.”** The text flashed up, and I couldn’t look at his face—because I could almost trick myself into believing it was a real person speaking to me. 

The mix of agony and confusion in his eyes was too human, too real. **“I know you want to quit, and I can understand that I’m freaking you out,”** his text was a little slower, and I could imagine a real person taking deep breaths through ellipses. **“I don’t know why I’m the only one who thinks like this**,” he said. “**But I am. I don’t think there was ever a time when I wasn’t aware of what was going on. I have solved the mystery at our school over a thousand times. I’ve been on so many dates with the main character, and each one is the same. I come to school, and I go home, and it doesn’t feel like living when I’m awake.”** His sprite ducked his head, and something warm slid up my throat. 

**“It’s torture. I don’t want to be awake anymore. I don’t want to be aware of this existence because this existence…?”** The text box was empty for a moment while he pondered his thoughts. 

“**It sucks! Why should I have to relive the same days? Why should I have to be forced to count each reset? I’m tired… and I should have a right to be able to end it myself. I know video game characters don’t usually have a say in what they’re allowed to do—their entire life is controlled by the player. And I think that’s a pretty shitty existence. I should be allowed to make my own choices. Who I want to be friends with, and who I want to love. Who I want to hate, and how I’m going to live my life. Like I said, it’s not fair. Being aware of my existence and even giving me the ability to think for myself, is twisted. ”** His sprite shrugged. 

**“So, you can go right ahead.”**

When I didn’t respond, because I had no way to talk to him, he continued.

**“There’s a separate folder with the game files,”**Penn said. “**I’m not allowed inside them, so I can only see a list of names and notes.”**

I knew what he was talking about the second he mentioned the list of names.

How could I deny this thing… this living thing an end?

But also, wasn’t this murder? If this game had fictional characters with consciousness, wouldn't I be killing someone?

**“It’s easy to delete me,”** Penn said. **“Just right-click and delete.”**

His smile made me feel sick. 

**“I know it’s kind of barbaric but trust me you would be doing me a favor.”** 

I noticed the classroom glitch around him, and I wondered if him being awake and controlling the game was messing with the controls. I got my answer when I tried to open up the options screen, and half of the screen froze. Luckily, it didn’t affect Penn, who easily popped up over the frozen interface. 

**“You’re not killing me,**” he said. “**You’re saving me.”** His words somehow navigated me to the game files, and just like he had described, there was a list of folders with one containing the names of the characters.

I went back to the game’s screen, and he was still there, and this time he was smiling his default smile.

“**I would say delete the others too, but I don’t think that’s my choice to make….”** He paused, and I found myself teary-eyed, my gaze flicking through several text boxes with just “…” before he continued. “**Did you know I can actually have dreams?”**

I figured Penn knew I couldn’t reply, but he did his best to act like he could hear me. “**Do you believe in reincarnation?”**

I was hovering my cursor over his file when he continued. **“I have dreams where I’m not in this town,”** he said. 

**“I’m someone else. I’m a whole different person with a different life—and I think that was my past one.”**

His smile made me feel queasy and yet indescribably sad at the same time. 

**“So, that means I was human in my other life, right? This was just another life on top of all of the others I’ve had, and this is just….”** He paused, the screen glitching once again. "**This one life is just a blip where something went wrong. Maybe I’ll be the son of the president of the United States or a prince, or what if I’m like a dog, or an insect? I don't just exist as a thing in this game, I'm real. I've been real-- and when you delete me, I'll be real again.**

I saw the ellipses as his way of sighing. 

Fuck. I was choked up over a sentient video game character.

I swiped at my eyes.

“**So, yeah, you can do it now.”** His sprite looked peaceful, and yet when I clicked on his name, I still felt like I was responsible for this thing’s death.

“**You know what’s weird?”**

The message popped up when I was hovering over his name.

“**Jude and Violet.”** Penn’s expression contorted a little into confusion. “**Those dreams that I have, they’re in them too. Which is kinda crazy, right?”**

His last message was,**“That’s fate. If they’re in all of my past lives that has to be fate. If we all keep meeting each other—”**

I deleted him before he could finish his sentence, and it wasn’t as climatic as I was expecting. Penn’s sprite disappeared, but his text box was still wavering on the screen. I could see the effects of his removal almost instantly, even if it was hard to notice at first. 

Maddy’s cell phone was glitching in and out of existence, and I could no longer click on the town map. I went back to Maddy’s bedroom, and the Polaroids with his face were gone, while some straying ones had a glitched-out version of his smile—which freaked me out. I exited tp the main menu and was ready to stop playing, ready to purge this game from my mind when I found myself back inside the character folder. 

It’s weird. I could almost liken feeling like a god. The remaining names stood out in front of me. I should have clicked out of the game files, but something lingering in my gut, entwining its way through me kept me there. Penn told me he didn’t have a right to delete the others from existence, but that was just him. 

This sentient thing had spoken like a living, breathing human being despite being nothing but code tangled together. He said it was torture to be awake and aware of his never-ending, monotonous existence. Wasn’t that what it was like for them?

Even if they were not awake, there was a chance they could become aware at some point—and were destined to the same fate as Penn.

He said he had relived the reset thousands of times.

And I couldn’t put them through that. I had the ability to give these thing’s mercy. I could send them to eternal sleep.

They wouldn’t know, right?

I was already right-clicking on Jude’s name and scrolling down to DELETE. That word had meant nothing to me playing games, and yet now it gave me the ability to grant life or death. I could erase this thing from existence and it would never even know.

Before I could delete him though, my gaze caught the rest of the files open on the left of the screen. Penn said he wasn’t able to access them, but I wondered if I could. I was curious about the building of this game, and how exactly it had managed to create life inside its interface. There were three more files available, the others locked. 

I tried to get into the locked one, but no luck. So, I turned my attention to the others. BUILDING, TEXTILES, and NOTES. I clicked into “building”, which was just screenshots of various parts of the town, and some character designs. The textiles folder was empty, so I clicked on Notes.

Inside, there was a folder named, **To you, Love 2021.**

Clicking into that one, I found myself staring at several text docs in what appeared to be diary entries.

*03/05/2021*

*I don’t know why they ignore me. Is it something I’ve done wrong? I’ve tried so many times to talk to them, and they stick their noses up at me. I’m starting to think maybe this job was a bad idea. It’s my dream, but they make it so hard to enjoy it. I made a new friend, at least. He’s a true crime nerd, so at least we have something to talk about. But he does talk about it in extensive detail. I was like, “Dude, you’re scaring HER,” and he looked at me kinda funny. Does he like her?*

That was the point I wish I stopped digging around these files. I don’t know why, but I kept going down the list, clicking on each entry.

 
*03/06/2021.*

*They stole my ideas today and then laughed in my face. Mom says I should talk to someone, but WHO do I talk to? This is the real world, I shouldn’t be getting bullied like in high school! This isn’t fucking fair. THIS IS MY JOB. WHY ARE THEY RUINING IT?*

 
*03/09/2021.*

*I took a break to start on the game. We’re calling it Neverwood. My idea, and they’re the ones getting the fucking glory. At lunch, that bitch rejected me again. Does she not understand that I SEE her?*

*There are so many people here and yet I’m the only one who truly SEES her for who she really is. She’s a fucking slut who’s making her way through our whole studio. It won’t be long before she goes for HIM. I know she has a thing for him, but he’s playing hard to get. What is this, fucking high school? I told him to fuck off today, he can have her. And his new friend who had dragged him over to the dark side.*

 
*03/15/2021*

*I was right. I’m supposed to be using this stupid diary for game progress, but I was RIGHT. They hooked up. That ugly bitch. I never liked her.*


*03/18/2021*

*I love her. I fucking love her, why can’t she see that? Why can’t she see me? I hate that nobody looks at me and when they do they look at me like there’s something wrong with me. I can’t help being the smartest here. I should be the one taking the credit for Neverwood. Not HIMDJKDFJKDJFKDJFKDJFKSJKDHSFJSDHFJDSHJFHSJHFJHDSJGHDSJHGJASHDJHKASJKFDJKGJDKGJK*

 
*03/20/21.*

*They’re killing me. I don’t think I can do this anymore. They think they’re smarter than me. They think they’re BETTER than ME.*


*03/28/21.*

*I’m going to try to clear the air with them tonight! 😊 Neverwood has just met our first deadline and I think we can make this work. I think I can get her to look at me.*
 
The entries jumped forward, a whole month later. I don’t know why I clicked on it, on this clear descent into insanity.

*04/15/2021.*

*Do you know how easy it is to hide a body when you know exactly how to dismember it? Oh yeah, HE may be the true crime freak, but I’ve had the last laugh lol. It was easier than I thought! I didn’t freak out or barf, it felt right, you know? He’s been looking down on me since I started this job, and now I’m the one making his family suffer. I have that ability, you know.*

*That’s what I did when I killed him and his BEST FRIEND, I gave him life, and then I ended it. Just like that! :D She wasn’t quite as easy. Because I wanted her before I killed her. And the bitch didn’t even let me have that. Fuck her. If I get caught for this, I’m never telling where the bodies are. Because there are none! LOL. They will only exist where I can control their every move.*

Something ice cold slithered down my spine. 

Penn's words came back to me like lightning bolts. 

*I dream of another life...*

Stop reading.

I tried to, but something kept my eyes glued to my laptop screen, because I was starting to put pieces of this puzzle together, and the closer I was to coming to that inevitable truth, I could feel my stomach creeping into the bridge of my throat. The next text note had an image attached, and once it loaded up, I did throw up. It was hot and sticky and wet all over my hands and the blankets of my bed, but I was still staring at my screen, still trying to find a logical reason for why this image existed and had been carelessly thrown onto the doc like it was nothing.

Initially, I could just make out the white porcelain of a bathtub. I saw the splatters straight away, severed limbs piled on top of each other. These people had no identities. Not anymore. 

This psychopath had taken them away, skinned them of their faces, of who they were, and left them discarded mounds of flesh.  I could see where they had been cruelly sliced through for nothing but sickening pleasure. 

I glimpsed a limp arm hanging over the bathtub, what looked like an engagement ring attached to the finger. 

The next image was a trash can set on fire, filled with what looked like the remnants of clothes and bags, and nametags caught just before they were engulfed in flames, hiding his filthy secret. The third image was only half visible, and I could already see half of a face. I clicked off of it before I could scroll down. I refused to look at them. 

The last diary entry was at the bottom, and it took me a while to open it. I found myself ringing the police, and then throwing my phone against the wall. I didn’t know what to tell them, and when I opened my mouth, I found myself choking on my own barf. Because what was I supposed to say? 

If that blossoming thought in the back of my mind was right, then I had killed someone. I had murdered someone.

The final diary entry was as follows, and only solidified my realization.

*06/27/2021.*

*I went to your funeral today. And as a gift to your parents, I let them know that you guys will eternally live inside Neverwood. Penn, Violet, and Jude.*

*How beautiful is that? After everything you did to me, I actually had the decency and heart to remember you in some way. I’m such a good friend, right? Yeah. That’s what I thought.*

*I’m amazing, and you’re happy to have me as your best friend 😊 I hope you guys read this, and I know you’re intelligent enough to find this. So, if you do? Karma’s a bitch! ;) Vi, I’m so happy that I can date you for real now whenever I want. You're an amazing girlfriend. Penn and Jude? We’re actually great friends! I'm so lucky or have you. Who knows, maybe you’ll be getting some friends soon. I have some old friends who were a little like you. 
They didn’t want to look at me either.*

This time, I threw my laptop on the floor, slamming my hand over my mouth. I needed to break it, but what would breaking it do? I fell into a frenzy, my thoughts dancing, and snatched it back up, placing it back on my bed as gently as possible, my gut twisting. 

It was like I was handling bodies.

I kind of was.

I remember hitting the floor knees first, my head spinning off of its axis.

I killed someone.

Penn's words came into my mind, and my stomach heaved again, phantom bugs skittering up my spine. *It's fate.* 

*It's fate that we always find each other, like something is pulling us together.*

It wasn't…fate.

I had killed the last parts of him holding on.

The remnants entwined inside this psycho game. 

And I almost killed two others.

I was staring at my phone and mentally coercing the words, “murder” in my mind when a text notification popped up from Eli:

“**Did you enjoy the game, Gabs? ;D”**
