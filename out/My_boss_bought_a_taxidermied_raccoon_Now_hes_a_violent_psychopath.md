I’ve been working at Frisky’s, my boss Jeff’s place, for about five years now.

Frisky’s has always been a bit grody. When they say a place is a “dive”, Frisky's is the low benchmark that other bars are diving towards.

Recently, though, the crowd’s gotten much rowdier, ruder, and a whole lot more obnoxious. The let’s-pretend-we’re-dangerous vibe that Frisky’s used to cultivate has given way to a genuine oh-shit-this-place-is-actually-dangerous vibe.

Jeff's solution? He bought a taxidermied raccoon and put it on the high ledge over the liquor shelf.

“What the hell is that?” I said.

“That, Jessie, is our new friend Roberto.” Jeff was smiling. I’d been under the impression that he didn’t know how to smile.

“And Roberto’s a raccoon.”

“You’ve got a very keen eye,” he said.

“I see that Roberto the raccoon is dead.”

“Another very astute observation.”

“Okay,” I said, “maybe I’m being unclear about what my concern here is. Jeff: Why did you put that dead raccoon up there?”

Jeff squinted his eyes and stared at Roberto the Raccoon. I could see the gears turning.

“It’s going to help with the shitbirds screwing up my bar.”

“How, though?”

He took a beat to think about that. Then he said, “I don’t know how exactly. But it will. It told me it would.”

“The stuffed raccoon told you…?”

“Jesus Christ!” He was almost yelling. His face turned red and he waved his hands like a schizophrenic vagrant at a ghost. “Quit being so nosy, Jess. Now it’s my goddamn bar, and it’s my goddamn raccoon, and I say it goes up there. No more questions. You got it?”

He picked up a bottle of Jack Daniels and threw it on the ground. An explosion of whiskey and glass shards launched into the air. I made the sound I imagine frightened pigs make.

Jeff stared at me, his respiration heavy and ragged as a pneumonic old man’s. I was afraid to move. 

“Roberto stays,” he said, his face quivering red.

And then he stormed out into the parking lot.

A few nights later we had a pretty good crowd of assholes: A biker gang. Or, a gang of men who were trying to represent themselves as a biker gang (meaning they likely did not have the bona fides of homemade Aryan Nations tattoos and access to a functioning crystal methamphetamine laboratory). They were doing that thing bullies do where they “accidentally” bumped their porky shoulders into people. They loudly yelled while looking around to make sure people could hear them loudly yelling.

Their leader was a guy who I would’ve guessed worked at H&R Block, if not for his leather vest stitched with associational patches. H&R Biker kept coming around the bar and trying to serve himself.

“You can’t come back here,” I said. “And you guys need to chill, or I’m going to ask you to leave.”

“Oh yeah?” H&R Biker said. He lifted his shirt, displaying the pistol tucked between his overhanging belly and his dungarees.

I tightened my lips and said nothing. I do not like guns in the bar. Guns and booze are a bad, bad mix. Their combined presence anticipates events like ATF raids, asset forfeiture, and condemnation proceedings. I walked away.

A while later Jeff came out of the office. I guess he noticed something was wrong.

He came up to me and placed his hand on my shoulder, which was unusual because Jeff was not a physically affectionate (or even physically comfortable) person. “Jess, what’s wrong? You seem troubled.”

I shook my head, avoiding eye contact while I wiped down the bartop. “Nothing. Everything’s fine.” I wasn’t very convincing, as you might guess. I can lie as well as the next gal, but not when I’m scared.

One of the regulars, a bawdy old skeeze with missing teeth, and untrimmed facial hair developing into an accidental handlebar mustache, whose name was Hank, leaned over the bar and told Jeff, “One of those Hell’s Angel wannabes has a piece.”

“A gun?”

“Yep,” Hank said, nodding toward the guy who’d flashed me his pistol, “the one who looks like the fat feller from *Seinfeld*. He’s packing.”

“I see,” Jeff said. “Let me think about what I should do. *Que le grand raton laveur nous guide*.”

Me and Hank traded glances. Both of us were probably confused by Jeff speaking what sounded like French, especially because he was a Freedom Fries guy. We watched him reenter his office.

“What was that about?” I said.

Hank shrugged and sipped his beer before offering this philosophical gem: “The French, the French, a very strange race; they fight with their feet and fuck with their face.”

Jeff came almost right back out of the office, then around the counter and behind me. He climbed up on the back bar. I saw something shining silver in his hand. It was a needle. 

Jeff stuck the needle into Roberto the Raccoon’s chest and said, “*Grand raton laveur, donne la sagesse de ton sang*.” Then he stuck out his tongue and pushed the needle through the tip.

Me and Hank looked at each other again, this time clear evidence of alarm on both of our faces, both of us completely flabbergasted. Jeff got down from the back bar. He removed the needle from his tongue and tucked it under the wristband of his watch. Blood dribbled down over his lips. It ran over his chin like a Halloween vampire mask. 

He approached H&R Biker and his henchmen at the table where they were sitting.

H&R Biker looked up at Jeff. “What the hell do you want?”

The speed and power of Jeff’s violence stunned me. He shot his rigid palm from his side like a pneumatic nailgun rocketing out a nail, and smashed H&R Biker’s nose flat into his face. The way the blood exploded from the guy’s nose reminded me of stepping on a fast food ketchup packet. Before I could really understand what was happening, Jeff had pulled the man’s gun from his waistband, cocked it, and then pressed the barrel against his forehead.

Several of the other bikers reached for their waistbands, their backs, or their vests. Jeff discharged a round in the middle of the table before bringing it back to H&R Biker’s skull. “The first one of you to touch your guns gets your buddy plugged. You are desecrating the Temple of Roberto. I am His apprentice. I warn thee, who would anger the Great One Who Eats Trash!”

The bikers looked at one another’s faces. I think each confederate was gauging whether their fellows were planning on making a move. But then Jeff started murmuring crazy whispers with the sound harshly clipped off at the end; the quiet babble of lunatics before they explode. I think they were afraid to even move. They must’ve been, I was, and Jeff was on my side. 

Jeff squeezed the pistol grip so tight that his suntanned fingers blanched white all the way through.

After a minute, one of the bikers said, “We’ll go. Just let us leave, and we’ll get up and walk out. We’re sorry about the trouble.”

A minor chorus of yeahs and okays were halfheartedly mumbled, indicating a majority vote.

“You can’t desecrate His Temple. Those who trespass before Him will be piled upon the refuse of His dumpster and scattered by His Nursery’s Great Feast.” Jeff waved the gun and screamed. “Do you understand?”

“We understand. Sir, we understand. I promise we understand,” their spokesman said.

Jeff seemed to be considering it. Finally, he dropped the gun down by his side. “Then go, and may Le Grand Raton forgive you and bless your dreams with His omens.”

The bikers left. Jeff went into his office and sat down. I checked on him before I closed up for the night. He was asleep in his chair.

Over the next few weeks, my boss’s behavior changed, becoming more bizarre by the day.

Once, when it was my shift to open the bar, I walked in and found him on his knees, facing Roberto the Raccoon, bowing his head and speaking rapid-fire French. I thought of Abraham smashing his father’s idols. The patriarch wouldn’t have gone in for Jeff’s heresies, that’s for sure.

But whatever Jeff was doing was working. The instigative patrons shaped up or shipped out, and the bar became a reasonably safe place again, while still maintaining a modestly rowdy reputation.

But as Jeff reached each new, bizarre toll on his lunatics’ turnpike, Frisky’s customer base shrunk smaller and smaller until barely even our regulars showed.

And that was before things even really got nuts.

•

My phone woke me up. It was my day off and I had wanted to sleep late, but I was also expecting a birthday present from my aunt, and I had to keep an ear out for the delivery driver’s call.

I looked at my phone. It told me both that it was four in the morning and that Jeff was calling. I answered. “Yeah?”

“*Jess, I have something very important to show you. Can I pick you up?*”

I sat up in bed. “Jeff—well…what—do you know what time it is?”

“*I need to show you. It’s very important that I show you. I’m waiting outside. Please, I just*—” it sounded like he was about to cry “—*I need your help, Jess*.”

“Yeah. Yeah, okay, just give me a minute. Let me get dressed.”

•

I watched the lightless green-black blur of the forest go by my window as Jeff drove us further out into the sticks. We’d been driving for an hour. The homesteads changed until they were all up long dirt drives and hidden behind trees, and soon after that there were no houses at all. I saw animals’ eyes glowing yellow and red in the darkness of the woods, daylight still more than an hour away.

Jeff hadn’t spoken the entire drive. So I’d tried to sleep until we got there (wherever “there” was). But I kept hearing him whisper to himself, those whispers with words harshly clipped at their ends. He said, several times, “*Sacrifiez-la en holocauste sur un tas d’ordures*.” I didn’t know what the whole phrase meant, but it’s never a good sign when someone suffering a nervous breakdown whispers the word “holocaust”. I couldn’t imagine its meaning was very different in French.

“Thanks for coming out here with me, Jess. I just have something important to show you.” Jeff nodded his head while he spoke, like he was a churchgoer affirming the truth of a testimony.

“Yeah, no problem. I’ve kind of been—” I stopped myself.

Jeff turned his head to look at me while he drove. “What? What is it? You can tell me.”

I turned to face him, too. I couldn’t believe it, I thought I might cry. “I’ve been really worried about you. Like—” I nervously laughed through my clogged nose, wiping the corner of my eye “—like really, really worried about you.”

I looked into his eyes, waiting. I jumped in my seat when he started laughing. And it was weird, forced laughter. And it got louder and louder, until it was wild, unhinged; laughter that had no connection to humor. He suddenly just clamped down on it, the sound of someone closing a door on a loud laugh-tracked sitcom.

“That’s crazy, Jess. That’s really a crazy thing to say. I’m doing so good. I’m doing the best I’ve ever been.” He whipped the steering wheel suddenly to the right. I screamed. He didn’t even respond to me screaming.

“Jeff, where are we going? You’re starting to scare me.”

“Ah, well…we’re here now. You’ll see right now. You’ll see.”

He pulled off on a dirt road. After a minute, he stopped the car in a clearing inside a dense circle of pines. “Here we are.”

It took me a minute to understand what the car’s headlights were illuminating. Maybe because they were familiar physical phenomena and objects, but in places where I’d never seen them before. And like sliding the last puzzle piece into place, it became clear. There was a shovel and a big dirt hole, a tarp and bungee cords right beside the freshly dug—

It was a grave.

“Jeff—” My speech was interrupted by blunt force trauma; I felt a distant pain and saw a bright flash of light. I’d been hit so hard that he’d knocked me out with the first punch.

I came to, and it seemed like only seconds later. Jeff was dragging me by my legs toward the unmarked grave. I screamed and I kicked at his hands. He grabbed me by my ponytail and whipped me forward. He tore hair from my scalp. He was so much stronger than he looked. It caught me unaware and he seized on my shock. I felt his workboot slam into my ribs, heard the crunching sound and shooting pain when they broke.

“Jess, don’t. Don’t make this harder than it has to be. Roberto has chosen you.”

Whatever was going to happen was going to happen. My broken ribs meant I was incapacitated. Every breath was agony. I cried even though it hurt something awful to let myself cry, even if I kept quiet and didn’t move while I did.

I watched him walk back to his still-idling car and open the trunk before taking something out of it. He walked back over next to me, and I saw he was holding the taxidermied raccoon. He placed it right next to my head, then bent down close and whispered to me, “This is a great honor for you.” I heard him sniffling. “It’s a shame He chose you, but…it’s also a great honor. You’re going to go to paradis des ratons laveurs. You’ll see. You’ll get an entire new life, resurrected as one of Roberto’s very own. And you’ll have all the trash you could ever eat, Jess. There’ll be no more pain. There’ll just be overflowing dumpsters and a new ringed-tailed family to keep you in their gaze. You’ll see. You’ll—”

“Jeff!” I heard someone yell. I recognized that voice. How did I know that voice? “Let her go,” the voice said, and I heard the sound of a shotgun cocked.

I managed to turn my head. It was Hank. He was flanked on all sides by almost a half-dozen coonhounds: a Treeing Walker Coonhound, a few Redbones, two Bluetick Coonhounds, too.

Jeff hissed. “L'ennemi juré infernal!”

“Jessica,” Hank said. “Can you drive that car?”

I croaked, hardly able to speak. “I don’t think I can.”

Hank was quiet for a short moment. “Well,” he then said, “you’re going to have to.” Hank whistled—it was loud and sharp, an expert’s taxi hail. “Louie,” he said, looking at one of the Bluetick hounds, who responded by stiffening his body from his snout to the tip of his tail, “emmène-la à la voiture.”

Louie the Bluetick Coonhound came and dipped his neck low next to me. He nudged my arms with his nose. I understood. I wrapped my arms around his neck. It was unbearable pain. But I understood the only other option was to stay here. And I didn’t want to see what happened next.

Hank kept his shotgun trained on Jeff as I completed the excruciating and tree-sap-slow process of getting in the driver’s seat of Jeff’s car.

“L’entourer!” Hank shouted, and the other five coonhounds surrounded Jeff and the taxidermied raccoon. Then, Hank backed up to the car, keeping the shotgun barrel level with Jeff’s head. He knocked on the window and I rolled it down.

“Hank, I don’t think I can drive,” I said.

“You ain’t got a choice now, kid. Cause I got business to take care of, and you can’t be here to see it.”

I looked over at Jeff. “What are you going to do with him?”

He looked at me, sucked his teeth and looked over his shoulder. He used his hand to signal directions as he spoke. “You drive out the way you came in. When you come to the main road, go left. It’s gonna take you longer, but keep on that road all the way until you see signs for the parkway. Take the parkway south. You’ll be back in town inside of an hour. I’ll come find you.”

“What are you going to do, Hank?”

“Goodbye, Jessica. Go now. Go!”

Maneuvering the car with my broken ribs hurt worse than anything I’d ever felt. But I managed to make it all the way home without crying. When I got to my parking lot, though, I broke down. And even though the pain was incredible (or maybe because it was) I bawled my eyes out, sitting in [the car](https://www.reddit.com/user/DickinsonPublishing/).
