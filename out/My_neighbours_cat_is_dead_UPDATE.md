Luna is a tabby cat that belonged to my neighbour and has lived on my street for over six years. I’ve never owned a cat and the closest experience I’ve ever had to one was Luna, so frequent high-pitched meows to be petted and the occasional cloud of feathers littered across our gardens soon became the norm. I’m a student studying Biomedical science in a city that I would consider the opposite to the close-knit community of my home village where my family still live. Cheap dopamine and miraged strangers disguised as close friends has likely warped my memories of the village, I once lived in but after coming home at the end of the school year… Something is seriously wrong.

 

Luna is dead. Not just dead, she’s mutilated. A concoction of flesh, bone and fur scraped across the pavement near my neighbour’s drive. When my parents picked me up and brought me home, I couldn’t believe I missed her as we entered the semi-circle arrangement of mine and our neighbour’s homes but the stench as I opened the car door was unmissable. The smell was so overpowering and unlike anything my professor could throw at us in dissections that he reasoned would “line our stomachs”. Even being outside it was like being smothered by an overpowering force of rotting meat and soured milk which accumulatively made the victim succumb to dry heaved gags to expel its toxication and desperate inhales as if you were drowning.  As I spun round in desperation looking for the source I locked vision with the unmistakable green eyes of Luna. Her body an unrecognisable pile of splayed cracked ribs and flattened limbs, her head was comparatively pristine to the rest of her body bar evident signs of deterioration around her half gaping mouth. Instinctively, as if I were twelve again alerting my parents to anything big or small that bewildered a child’s mind, I pointed at Luna darting my head towards my dad, “Lun-“

“Lunch? Did you hear that dear our little grown up isn’t so independent after all. Come on in and we’ll fix you up something to eat. You’ve been gone so long it’s a miracle you’ve lasted this long on pot noodle and burnt eggs”

 

My dad chuckled as he unlocked the door, him and my mum entering inside. An Overbearing sense of hopelessness came over me as I obediently followed them inside and sat down at the kitchen table.

 

The cat belongs to my neighbour Ida who lives opposite our house. She’s somewhere in her late 60’s early 70’s who has no husband, children or friends despite the odd visits people on my street pay to her and the awkward exchanges we shared when I delivered her the morning paper some years back. The following morning I tried walking over to Luna’s body with the intention of giving her the much-needed respect she deserved of a proper burial but was stopped dead in my tracks by Ida suddenly appearing in her front doorway. A saucer of milk in one hand and a crumpled tissue in the other Ida tried to coach her cat over to the door with an ensemble of kissing sounds and calling her by her name. Defeated, Ida placed the milk outside among an arrangement of similar looking bowls and saucers. I can’t be the one to break this woman’s fantasy. Everyone I speak to from my parents to my neighbours welcoming me home, has not in anyway spoken or hinted towards the situation of Ida and Luna.

 

The gleam of the cat’s eyes staring back at me in the moonlight hues and the evolving stench each morning became unbearable. My parents were washing dishes at the sink. Swallowing my anxiety and with a quite mumble from my seat at the table I said what no one else would.

 

“Why isn’t anyone moving Luna?”

 

My parents with their backs facing me became motionless and it was if the entire street had become instantaneously silent as if by command. The upbeat rhythm of the radio on the kitchen side was the only sound to be heard. A sudden knock at the door broke the tension and almost on cue both my parents scurried off to the door only a few mummers barely audible.

“Sorry honey me and your father forgot we made plans this evening with the Whittick family, your welcome to join but it will be quite dull for you, I fear. I don’t even know why I even made plans with them myself, they can be quite a bore”.

 

With that my parents left the house. This is the closest I have come to speaking about Luna since coming home. I spoke to a friend from university about this and he suggested asking here. Please, if there’s anything you can suggest it helps a lot more then you realise. This whole thing is making me restless.

**Edit: 08/07 2024**

I was hoping I wouldn’t have to come back to this post for a while and that the memory of Luna would be left well enough alone as the friendly neighbourhood mascot I remember. I deleted my previous post to save any confusion as to my present situation but thank you to the suggestions and condolences for Luna people have made, but I don’t think these will be of any use. I should have come clean from the start as to the week which followed my arrival here and if I don’t manage to leave this place as the man I was when I opened that car door, then I only hope this post and any that follow may act as my only glimpse of hope if it ever comes to that.

My parents both work in the village during the weekdays and with my summer job being hijacked by my former classmate my days here at the house have been for lack of a better word, stagnant. I don’t own a car, let alone know how to drive one. Living in a City for University where the handful of interesting areas it has to offer a short walk from each other, has diminished my reasoning to learn given I’d be rewarded with ever growing debt of car insurance and parking tickets to go alongside my student loan. So I’m at the house all day everyday much like Luna who is yet to be moved. I don’t understand why everyone ignored and still does ignore her laying there. I’ve tried, although in vain given being prone to social anxiety, to move her from my neighbours drive but each time I do I’m either put off by the shifting of curtains among the rows of houses or the ritualistic appearance of Ida with her saucer of milk.

Some of the kids who live on the street have started to take notice of Luna as well but aren’t in anyway disturbed by the scene before them as they continue their games of Ring a Ring a Roses or the childhood favourite “what time is it Mr wolf”. For those of you who haven’t played the game before I’m not so sure as to the premise myself even though I used to play it when I was younger just like them. From what I remember we would all line up in front of the promoted “Mr Wolf” and would each take turns asking, “what time is it Mr Wolf?”. Mr Wolf would then relay a time such as “its six o’clock” then everyone in unison would take six steps towards Mr Wolf or any equivalent steps to the time provided. I never quite understood how you were supposed to win the game. Mr wolf would seemingly abide by his own rules and would relay times in an illogical order “seven o’clock, five o’clock, twelve o’clock” until we were an arm’s length from him and winning the game before he would yell “Its dinner time!” chasing us down one by one as we fled in terror.

On my third night back me and my parents were watching a film. I can’t remember the characters names never mind the plot but at about the halfway mark a muffled, yet audible, meow could be heard. At first, I didn’t think I heard it right and was reassured by the ever-present smile of my parents as their eyes remained fixated on the screen. I settled back down in my seat trying to make sense of the disaster of a film before me. Even my mum seamed to become increasingly disinterested as she began to yawn and let her eyes wander around the room. Again I heard meow cocking my head towards the window, a thick heavy set of curtains obscuring any light seeping through.

“Did you guys hear that?”

“Yeah, Leah just made a big mistake leaving Mark like that. The man has like three boats! Think about all the fishing trips she could have been on.”

“That’s exactly what a man would say isn’t it. Real mature. Maybe next time we get into a spat I’ll see where your priorities really lie when I pose you the dilemma of fishing or your family.” My mum said with a half chuckle and an all too serious stare at my dad to match.

“You know my family come first.”

I let their conversation unfold, it did seem a little silly interrupting them over a meow that I may not have even heard and even if I did would that really be so strange in a neighbourhood full of cats besides Luna. The meow came again, louder than before and what I could only guess as a hiss to follow that rather sounded liked a gagged hiccup. My parents must have heard it this time, but they still seemed as oblivious as ever. Curiosity got the better of me as I stood pacing towards the curtains, my hand clutching the end. I began to draw the curtains open before an iron grip seized my arm. I darted my head round to see who this was only to be met by the face of my Father contorting as if unsure whether to display fear or fury. His eyes were wide as if his eyelids had been pulled back beyond capacity by some invisible force, every darkened detailed layer of his pupil in synchronised dilation creating a display as if he were taking in every ounce of detail of seeing me for the very first time. The meows grew louder turning into hisses and pained yelps, the gargled hiccup becoming a trademark to each punctuation of pain in rebuttal to the wavering curtains resisting against the tensed grip of my father’s free hand.

“What are you doing? Mum do somethi-“

My mother remained in the same position as she had been moments before still looking at the TV screen without an ounce of reaction or annoyance to the disturbance we had created.

“Have you been doing drugs?”

“What? No, dad I-“

“My son a junky! I can see it in your eyes plain as day!”

“No, sir I don’t do that. What are you-“

“Is that back chat I hear? Do you think you have any right to talk to me that way in the state your in right now? Off your head on everything and anything, and in my house!”

I remained in shock awe at what my father was accusing me of.

“I don’t want to see you for the rest of night, go upstairs and go to bed!”

He released my arm and remained standing at the curtain watching my surrender as I kissed my mother goodnight and exited the room. I don’t know what to make of the whole thing, but one thing is sure, nothing about this place is normal. The following morning my parents acted as if nothing had happened the previous night. I even laughed to myself thinking the whole thing was a dream concocted by the recesses of my mind, but my fears were soon realised when I glimpsed two more cats dead outside our kitchen window. My question as to why no one had moved Luna as I mention previously was what followed. Ill update anything I find here and again, if there’s any suggestions you can give me it means more than you think.
