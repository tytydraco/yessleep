Hey, Jack here, and boy do I have a story for you. I had arrived home from my nightshift as a security guard at about 5am. As you can expect, I was in desperate need for a shower. I got some clothes, a towel, and went in my bathroom.




I spun the knob to turn the shower on, and started cleaning myself. When I got to my hair I had to close my eyes. Closing my eyes… I felt something was nearby - almost as if I could feel an ominous presence coming from… 


behind me.


I quickly wiping off the suds from my face, I whipped around - eyes wildly searching… I saw it, it seemed to be 8 feet tall, pitch black eyes, hunched over, long nails, pale skin, a distorted face, and skinny body. I tried to move but I couldn’t. I was too scared, but as soon as I found my bearings - I got out of the shower. I ran backwards, not taking my eyes off that THING. I quickly hid in a closet, peeking out as the thing walked out. It drug it’s feet, the sluggish movement of it creating an awful scraping noise. A slow, distorted, inhuman distorted laugh came from its giant mouth. Luckily it didn’t find me, but I knew that thing was going to be here a while.




As soon as he left the room, I heard my front door burst - open gunshots being sounding but then… a moment of quiet. The longest few seconds of my life passed, but then I heard something… it was screaming and crying, and then the unsettling silence resumed - only to be disturbed by haunting laughing, and the shuffling sound of the bodies being moved. It dragged two men to the shower. I saw their lifeless bodies. These two supposed ‘hunters’ of this beast. Their bodies looked like they had been shredded with little effort given, their head a giant open wound pouring blood from what seemed to be a bite. I could only hold my breath and imagine what would have happened to me had I not hidden.




I waited for hours, and hours, until the ominous presence left. I left the closet, went to the shower… and what I saw was nauseating. The two dead bodies drowning in a pool of their own blood. Still in shock, I stumbled to the front door to see the damages. The door luckily wasn’t too bad, and I could easily fix it with the toolset my dad got me last Christmas. 

My mind was in a paranoid state. I didn’t know what to do. So, I cleaned the evidence of the dead bodies. The smell of the blood was putrid, and I feared I’d never see the end of the red that drained out of the bathtub. I was terrified. I wanted the night to be over. I loaded my gun and set it beside me… who knew if I’d remain alone in my room tonight. 




Update:
I woke up and I hear it. That same slow, distorted laughter…
