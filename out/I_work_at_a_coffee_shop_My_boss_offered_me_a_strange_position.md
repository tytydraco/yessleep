I'm a long time fan of r/nosleep and creepypastas in general. Obviously, like most, I take them as fiction. Or at least, I did. I might have to consider something that, until recently, I would have thought ridiculous. I've found myself wrapped in a story of my own, one that I doubt anyone will believe. I can't share it with my family as I am not fond of becoming the butt of every joke, the same goes for my friends.

Assuming I don't get killed for not seeing that a latte was supposed to be made with almond milk (that is a hazard that regular baristas face, nothing to do with the hauntings that plague The Drowsy Spectre), then I’ll just update things here. I’ve been given Tuesday and Wednesdays off, giving me plenty of time to write down whatever weird stuff happens.

So far, I’ve only worked one shift at the new location. I have a long history with one of Richard’s other chains, The Drowsy Student. I’ll start there, where my boss, who is the owner of the chain, came to offer me a strange position.

There I was, working my five hour shift. Short, I know. Most of the shifts at my old job were. Lots of young people that work have to dance around their college schedules. Drowsy Student, where I worked under the same owner, was placed strategically between three different college campuses. If it were me, I'd pick one campus and drop the store right next to it. Richard, the owner, thought it best to place it in a position that would see more morning traffic. Students going to their first class, which made a lot of sense I guess. I don't have a business degree, so I don't know. Never felt the pull to go get a higher education, though that's not to shame anyone who does. I've never had the money, nor the inspiration.

That's probably why I was stuck there, making a passable wage with part-time hours. Most everyone there had classes, went to college, so I felt a bit out of place at times. I made a few friends though. The closing shift is like that. Even if you’re working with people you'd never consider hanging out with, something about late hours and slow business brings people together. Mostly complaining, the greatest common ground any person could find. Richard was a good boss by comparison, but every job had things to whine about.

Anyways, this was one of the few nights that I didn't stay to fully close. We locked the doors at 9:00pm, clocked out and went home around forty five minutes later. Since it was so slow during the late hours, oftentimes one person would be sent out at 8:30. That Friday, it was me. I didn't have any other friends outside The Drowsy Student, nor anyone at my apartment waiting on me. Most got a dog, or maybe a cat. I didn't hate animals, I just didn't have one. That's why I decided to stay; there was no reason for me to go home. Everyone I had was there, closing down the store. I had my phone, scrolling through reddit and waiting for everyone else to finish their shift so we could complain about our lives outside the store. Besides me, there was one other person in the lobby. They had a laptop open, a large book beside them, and a large cup of fuel sitting far too close to their studying tools.

Sometimes Richard parked out back to make a stealth approach through the back door. I wasn't certain if he did that to check on his employee base, maybe to see if there was more talking than working when he wasn't around on the slow closing shift. He'd have us pull out the fridges, scrub the booths. Yeah, those were all smart and reasonable things for the person paying you to request, but that didn't mean any of us liked it.

I could see the office from my comfortable spot at the front of the store, in a corner that guaranteed another customer wouldn't sit near me. That was unlikely anyway, considering the hour, but it was instinct. The back door in the office opened to introduce Richard, who noticed me instantly. Whenever Richard saw someone he knew, he smiled big and waved. This time it was no different.

Much to my dismay, he approached. "Want me to get you a sleeping bag?"

A joke, but I would have accepted. "I think we are all going to Waffle House after they close up."

"Waffle House, huh? I bet they get plenty of business this late. It’s all breakfast food, though. I tried that, but there isn't enough room in the kitchen. The truth of the matter is that we do plenty of business in the morning, it balances out how slow it is at night. Maybe that is it, maybe we need to do more breakfast in the evening." I hadn't asked about any of that, but this was just how Richard was. "You mind if I borrow you for a sec?"

I wasn't clocked in and it wasn't worth it to bother him about getting paid for sitting down. If he wanted to talk, I was probably in trouble for something. Wasn't wise to make it worse. "Yeah."

"Come on, we'll talk in my office."

The red chair in his office was cushioned, but that didn't make it comfortable. I was constantly adjusting, which I hoped didn't give him the idea that I was simply uncomfortable in his presence. He always joked that he felt like an intimidating boss, that everyone just needed to relax around him. I was trying to, but the damn chair was set on hurting me. Whenever I adjusted my legs, I had to be careful not to knock over a pile of papers, or kick some cringy trinket referencing how good caffeine was. ‘I don't really rise and shine, I just caffeinate and hope for the best!’ Ugh, kill me. He had talked about putting that on the back of our uniforms too. I'd hang myself.

"So, how are you?" Richard always started off like that.

"Making money." That was a stupid reply. Why did I say that?

He laughed, as was polite. A pity laugh. "Look, I wanted to offer you a position." That was far better news than I'd hoped for.

"What sort of position?"

"You work nights, mostly. You aren't taking classes, unless that has changed, but you aren't available to come in until around 1:00pm." Personal preference, but I wasn't going to tell him that. "If you were able to come in even later, stay into the night, would you? I get the feeling you are a night owl."

Richard had a few locations, but none of them were open overnight. "Doing what? Cleaning, or something?"

"No, no. Nothing like that." Why was he so hesitant? "Look, there is another chain I own. Not really a chain, I guess, since there is only one of them. Would a drive up by Rose Hill be too far for you?"

If it meant an overnight shift and more hours, it didn't matter. "Not at all. I didn't know we had anything up there."

He sighed, then went serious. "We don't." Be quiet, the message was clear. "Some around here know about it, but only those I trust. Naturally, that means that if you refuse..."

So it wasn't an offer, it was an ultimatum. "Did someone complain?"

"People are always complaining, that's half the business. No, Axel. I have vacancies that need to be filled. Turnover is pretty intense on the overnights. I think you will like it, though. It isn't even open during the day, save for a few hours just before sunset."

"But why the secrecy?"

"It was my first shop." He confessed. "Didn't take off like I wanted it to. This? This is my success, The Drowsy Student. I want to be known for that, not my first failure."

That seemed a bit extreme, but I wasn't going to bother pushing it. "And I'd be paid the same?"

"More, actually. There are certain... hazards, working in such a remote place."

"Remote? You said it was in Rose Hill."

"By Rose Hill, not in. It is near the highway, off to the side."

"There isn't a college up there." It was making sense.

Richard shook his head. "No."

No wonder it was a failure; from what I knew then, Richard would have no income there. "So why put a coffee shop there? What business do you expect?"

"Oh, plenty come through."

I had to take his word on that. "And if the place closes down?"

Richard laughed at that, a real laugh. "Then I'd be in big trouble. It won't, though. But, if it eases your mind, you will have a place here. What do you say?"

It really didn't take that long for me to come to a decision. If what Richard was offering was real, then it was truly the greatest offer I could have hoped for. I shrugged and told him that I accepted, then asked when I would be able to start this new dream position.

"Monday, please."

"That is perfect, then."

"Let me get you a packet, then." He spun in his chair to tear at the disorganized mess that was his desk. Finally, he found a manilla folder. "Here we are. There are some different products over there, as well as different policies. There is one thing you need to know, Axel; it is *much* more strict over there. I expect the finest adherence to these policies. If I have to let you go, I won't be putting you back here."

That was fair. "You can trust me." Considering it would be completely dead at this other shop, I wasn't really concerned about policies or procedures. I planned to give it a read regardless. "What is it called?"

"The store?" Richard stood and straightened his polo. "The Drowsy Spectre. You can see where this store's title was inspired. I won't be there Monday, but Selene will. She's the manager and is there nearly every night. She’ll show you the ropes." He went for the back door. "I expect a survivor, Axel."

That was a weird thing to say, coffee shops weren't known for killing people. I learned, however. That next morning was a Saturday, and I happened to be off. That gave me two days to prepare, to read up on the papers that Richard had provided. It was a joke, or I had at least thought so at the time. Things like "Do not, under any circumstances, buy candles from the lady by the lake. When running trash, answer any question she asks honestly." Or "When the Heartmin comes in, her order must be completed in two minutes. Otherwise, hide in the freezer."

Richard had an odd sense of humor, so I didn't think much of it. Important things, like "Arrive thirty minutes before opening and *do not* unlock the door until opening at 7:00pm" and "If you hear knocking at the back door, don't answer unless it's only five raps." Made sense, considering the obscure location.

Monday came. The shop was just outside of Rose Hill, which was already a country sort of town. Again, I was shocked at the placement of the business. It was twenty minutes out of Rose Hill, which meant the likelihood of anyone making the journey to the Drowsy Spectre was very small. When I arrived, I found that the store was in surprisingly good condition. Considering how long it must have been open for it to be Richard's first business, and the lack of revenue it must produce, it should have been in pieces.

It was rustic from the outside. Made of logs, or at least meant to look so, with soft lighting at the entrance. It was 6:15pm. There was nearly no traffic, but I left early just in case. The door would be unlocked at 6:30 to let me in. I thought it wise to show that I arrived early, displaying my work ethic. Stupid, I know, but that was me. It was locked, as expected, but I could not see anyone inside. I would have expected the manager to arrive early, get things started before the rest of the employees arrived. My car was the only one in the parking lot when I arrived but, when I turned around, there was one other. I assumed they were the manager.

A woman stepped out of a Ford fiesta. It was an old car, probably from the 80's. I am not proficient in cars, however, so I am not sure. Anyway, she waved at me. She was my age, maybe a bit older. Just under her thirties, I guessed. A flower dress was out of place in the cold fall weather, as were her sandals. She opened the back of her car and pulled out a box. I could see, even from my place on the porch, that they were full of candles. She left the trunk open and went towards the drive thru.

She paused. "I haven't seen your face around here. What's your name?"

The candle lady. The folder said to answer her, I felt inspired to do so. "Axel, I just started. This is actually my first day."

"Axel. I like that name. I'm Amber Bucker. I sell candles over by the lake, just by the drive thru. Lots of people here buy them, even Selene. You want to come back and have a look?"

She seemed sweet, but I refused. It wasn't because of the rules, it was just that I wasn't a huge fan of candles. That, and I was waiting on Selene. "Maybe another time."

"I'll hold you to that, Axel White."

I hadn't told her my last name, but I didn't put much thought to it. She came back for a table and another box, then closed her trunk without a word. She glanced at me a few times. Pushed her hair behind her ear and looked away whenever I noticed. Eventually someone else arrived, just one minute before the doors were to be unlocked. A crown vic, old too. Looked like everyone here drove something older than I was. A redhead climbed out, dressed in enough black to scream edgy. Black eyeliner contrasted green eyes, ones that were locked on Amber's car. They fell on me.

"You didn't buy anything, did you?"

"I read the policy on that. We aren't supposed to."

"That's good." She put her hands on her hips.

"She seemed nice. Amber, I mean. She said you liked her candles, though."

Selene scrunched her nose. "She tells people that. I never bought one though, I don't have a death wish."

"Death wish?" That was a bit extreme.

She looked me up and down. "Look, you've just started. I get it, everything seems super weird. It doesn't get better, but you'll get used to it." A loud beeping caused Selene to pull out her phone. She had a popsocket with a llama that had... a horn? A llamacorn? That didn't really match with her emo appearance. "Scoot. I gotta unlock the door."

More cars pulled in, just on time. They weren't as ancient as the other vehicles. A white truck, a gray sedan, I think the white sedan was a Honda. I am a bit weird, perhaps making first impressions without even meeting someone. Cars didn't really say much about a person, but I still do it. Can't stop.

I met Barrow, Em, and John as they came through the door. Everyone pooled in the lobby just inside, then I realized that we were waiting on Selene to lock the door. She did, just a minute after opening it. Then she turned around and got all serious.

"Don't touch this lock. I don't care who you see outside. Even if they beg you, don't let anyone in." I nodded. "Y’all keep an eye on him. This guy here is Hook, he'll show you around. The rest of you? Introduce yourselves. This part is getting boring." She went on her way, presumably to her office.

Hook sighed and rolled his eyes before taking the lead. "Barrow, nice to meet you." He had a well-kept goatee and, when he shook my hand, a firm grip. I was certain I'd get along with him.

"Why'd she call you Hook?"

Glaring in the direction of the office, Barrow answered. "She's got nicknames for everyone. Lots of turnover here, makes it easier for her to remember everyone. When we met, she thought my beard looked a bit like..."

He trailed off, but I got it. "A pirate."

"Yeah." Barrow was quick to change the subject. He introduced a blonde girl, who awkwardly stuck out a small arm as he spoke. "This is Em."

"Hi. Hope you don't-"

"Not yet." Barrow cut her off. "This is John."

"Hey man." My father always told me you could measure a man by a handshake. I don't know if I believe that, but John wiggled more than shook. He seemed the youngest, but he had an energy I liked. "Shouldn't have said yes to Richard, just saying."

"Did you all come from the other locations?"

"Pretty much." Em nodded. "Barrow and I have been here the longest. John here started with his brother, who you are replacing."

"He quit?"

They glanced at Barrow, who seemed to be the leader in the group. "You could say that."

It was an odd response, but it was clear that was all I was going to get. "Overnights aren't for everyone, I guess."

"Oh, he liked overnights. That wasn't it." Barrow waved an arm. "Let me show you around. I assume Richard gave you the folder with our... policies?" I nodded. "Policy is a fancy word, it doesn't really have the weight that it should. Rules is a better one. They are rules and breaking them could get you fired, or worse."

"Or worse?"

"Yeah. Don't worry about that just yet. What do you remember?" Before I could answer, he waved an arm. "Actually, I'll just tell you. Easier to learn visually, right?"

I learned by experience, so he was right. "Sure."

He brought me behind the counter, the others followed. "This is the drive thru. The rules aren't really numbered, but we will call this number one because it really is the least of them. Don't open the window unless there is a customer *in* a car. One fellow comes around sometimes and he is mostly harmless, unless you go outside with him. We call him Tall Ben. He'll try to talk you into climbing out the window and it honestly isn't worth the trouble of getting rid of him. Just don't open the window unless someone is in a car."

That was a bit odd, but we were in a secluded spot. Who knows how many weirdos came around. "Rule two, we'll call it. There is a blonde lady that comes in, we call her Heartmin. She has a stupid drink she orders every time. It’s gotta be done in two minutes. The list says to hide in the freezer if you don't, but most times you can just cover your ears. She screams... very loudly. Next is the back door. Tall Ben, sometimes someone else, will knock and get you to open it. Don't. If it is someone important, it'll be-"

"Five knocks."

"Good, you did read them. Next is Tom. He'll come in and bother any female employee. If none are working, he will leave. It is on us to make sure we warn them if he shows up. He'll try to get pictures and, if he does, that is very bad for them."

"He is a creep." Em added. "But yeah, we go to the bathroom or something. He leaves eventually."

"There are some other... situational ones that we can go over once they come up. Last two, though, are the most important. Don't unlock the door before 7:00 pm, and do *not* buy candles from Amber. That one is super important."

"Why not?"

"Don't worry about that. You'll be fired on the spot, no questions asked. Do *not* buy anything from her, but make sure to answer her questions. If you don't, she will tell us. You'll be fired."

"What?" That was entirely ridiculous. "Is she Richard's daughter or something?"

"Sure." Barrow shrugged.

"Hook!" Selene shouted from her office. "Lights are out!"

They weren't, I could see just fine. I could see the light coming from the edge of the office door, too. There was a lightswitch outside the door and Barrow flipped it. Nothing happened, but Selene did step out afterwards.

"Thanks." She offered, then went back inside.

Barrow turned to me. "Situational. Just flip the switch if she says that."

"The light was on though."

"Don't worry about that."

7:00 pm came around. Selene checked up with me, made sure I was prepared for the shift. Someone was waiting outside the door. They had a hoodie on, I couldn't see their face as the setting sun offered little light. They left just before 7:00, being just out of sight when Selene unlocked the doors.

"We're open." She stared out into the parking lot. "And she's here already. That was fast."

A massive van pulled in. Black, fit for maybe eighteen people. It took up nearly four parking spaces, mostly because the one driving it didn't know how to park the beast. Out came a blonde woman, eyes fiercely locked on the front door.

"Let us handle Heartmin. Just watch and you'll pick it up." Barrow waved him over. "Come by the register. I know you worked at Drowsy Student, but it is a bit different here."

I obliged just as Heartmin pushed open the door. She sighed long when she entered, but she seemed like a normal woman. Heartmin approached the counter and gave Em a fake smile. She made an act of looking at the menu on the wall behind Em, but Barrow made clear that she was a long time regular. Wouldn't she already know what was on it?

"Do you have heavy cream?" Heartmin asked.

"Still don't. I don't think Richard is able to sell it before it spoils."

She scoffed. "Well I will take a large, hot latte. Breve. Do you have honey?"

Em nodded. "I can put honey in it."

"Yeah. That'll be it."

As soon as she said this, Barrow hit a button. I leaned over and realized it was a timer. Em quickly wrote down the order on a cup and let Barrow get to work. Barrow had already steamed the milk and had two shots of espresso ready, so the drink was done in seconds. There was no need for the timer. Barrow put the drink on the counter to his left and called for Heartmin.

"Thank you." She took it, sipped, and found it acceptable. "Thanks." Then, she left.

"Well that was lucky. You never know when Heartmin will come in, she is entirely random. Good first time for you though, sometimes it is during a rush. One time, DeGuire..." Barrow hesitated. "Well, he had it hard the first time."

Someone else came in, then another. Lots of strange people, but more than I had expected. Odd accents, weird clothes, and even stranger orders. John was back in the kitchen, Barrow told me that was his usual station. He came up front when he had no orders, which was often. A sandwich that was just meat. Meat for bread, meat for... well, meat. Meat instead of lettuce and tomato. John brought out a moldy piece of bread and I was going to stop him, but the customer saw the mold and grinned before offering a oddly sexual thanks.

I met Tall Ben, too. He isn't... right. Meeting him made me realize that there was something unnatural around The Drowsy Spectre. Ben was a lanky giant, there was no other way to put it. He was three or four times my height and sure, I am not that tall, but *no one* is *that* tall. I say I met him, but I really only saw him outside the window. He waved, but I didn't open the window. I would have assumed he was on stilts or something, but his head was too big. His whole body was stretched, hands big enough to pick me up if he wanted to. To eat me.

"What does he want?" I asked.

Barrow hadn't noticed him. "Probably to eat you." Just like I guessed. "Nice not opening the window."

"Is that mistake made often?"

"Like I said, lots of turnover."

I was certain there had to be an explanation for Ben's stature. We were in redneck country, who knows what sort of defects happened where society couldn't reach. The doubts of The Drowsy Spectre's supernatural nature, however, were shattered when Em came running from near the front door.

"DeGuire is here!"

"Damn him." Barrow dropped everything. "Are we empty?"

"Yeah, no one is in."

"Lock the door."

"But-"

"Lock it!"

The door creaked and welcomed a man in a long coat. I had never, until that day, seen yellow eyes. He was pale, like he'd not seen the sun in a long time. He looked around, then noticed Em near the front counter. He slowly approached and Em was quick to hurry behind the register. I assumed this was DeGuire, the fired brother of John. DeGuire was a last name, though. I did not have the privilege of knowing his first. There was tension in the air; it didn't seem like my right to break it, so I remained silent. Did the lights dim? I think they did.

"Changed your mind?" He asked.”You *know* it is the right thing to do.”

"Get out, DeGuire." Barrow held a shot glass in his hand, prepared to turn it into a dangerous projectile.

DeGuire stared for a moment. "You don't have anyone!" Finally, he noticed me. "You. You are here to replace me, right?"

"Don't answer him, Axel."

"You'll take my place?"

I didn't speak, but Barrow reinforced his command. "Don't speak to him!"

"One of you!" DeGuire raised his voice. "TAKE MY PLACE!" The lights shattered, raining sparks and glass. I protected my eyes and face, as did the others.

Selene had exited her office, a crucifix in her hand. "Get out, DeGuire!" She held it out to him. "Get out!"

He averted his gaze. "Selene, please! You know me!"

"We all did, DeGuire." John stood by the kitchen. "You're gone."

"IT ISN'T FAIR!" He begged. "It isn't!"

I could see Tall Ben outside the glass windows that made up the front of the store. He seemed genuinely interested in the drama.

"Get out." Selene demanded.

DeGuire hesitated, then backed towards the door. He looked up at me one last time. "If you want to take my place, if you want to do the right thing, then put this on." A ring fell from his hand, landing on the mat by the front door. It was a gold ring, maybe a wedding band. When he left, Tall Ben tracked him. He eventually waved at us before tailing DeGuire into the woods.

Everyone let out a collective sigh. "Well done, new guy." Selene offered. "You didn't speak. That is for the best." She pointed at the ring. "Just don't touch that, and we will all be fine."

"You don't want to move it?"

"No, no. It'll be gone when we come in tomorrow. DeGuire stops in sometimes. Just... let us handle him."

With that, she went back to her office. I was still trying to process DeGuire's haunting visit. None of it was normal, not the yellow eyes, nor the shattering of the lights. Between him and Tall Ben, I was beginning to understand that some things could not be explained. Sometimes weird stuff happened when you got away from the city and it seemed that this store served those weird things.

It was much darker since the lights shattered, so Em offered to fix it. "I'll get the ladder."

I had questions, however. "Barrow, what happened to DeGuire?"

He was hesitant, but I didn't not have to pester to break him. Barrow let out a long sigh, then stared with regret at the woods. "He bought a candle."

Nothing more notable happened that night, other than the occasional strange order or customer. I went home, closed my blackout curtains, and took some melatonin. Like I said, I have Tuesdays and Wednesdays off. If something else happens during the weekend, and you all are interested, I'll write it all down here. It is... therapeutic. Gets my mind off of why I came here, to Rykar Valley, as well as helps me process the strangest night I've ever experienced.

Thanks for reading, and I'm sure I'll have plenty more to talk about soon.
