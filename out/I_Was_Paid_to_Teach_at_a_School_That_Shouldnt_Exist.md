I never thought I’d return to Foshan. It was supposed to be in my past—a place I’d left behind for good. But when I received the letter saying my mother was gravely ill, I knew I had no choice. So, with my freshly earned degree in education and dreams of a new life on hold, I made my way back to the village I thought I’d escaped forever.

But the village was different now, warped by time and something more sinister. The streets were narrower, more twisted than I remembered. The buildings loomed over me, their facades cracked and crumbling. The villagers, once familiar faces, now barely acknowledged my presence, their eyes shadowed with something dark and unspoken. The air was thick, heavy with a sense of wrongness that I couldn’t quite place.

As I wandered through the narrow alleys, trying to make sense of the changes, a faded flyer pinned to a crumbling wall caught my eye. The paper was old, yellowed with age, and the words on it sent a shiver down my spine: "Seeking a high school teacher for a high-paying job. Teach for 10 days, and earn 5000 RMB. Nanyue School."

I stared at the flyer, my mind screaming that this had to be a joke. No school would pay that much, especially not out here. Yet, I couldn’t tear my eyes away. I was about to rip it down when I overheard two women nearby, their voices low and tense.

"That’s the Nanyue School," one whispered, her voice trembling. "They say it’s cursed. The last teacher…he just vanished."

Vanished? My heart skipped a beat. I wanted to dismiss it as village superstition, but the words dug into me, festering like an open wound. I didn’t believe in curses, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. And yet, curiosity—and the promise of money—pushed me to investigate further.

The next day, I found myself standing outside Nanyue School. The building was ancient, its once grand façade now cracked and covered in creeping vines. The air around it was thick with a musty odor, like damp earth mixed with something rotten.

Mr. Wong, the principal, met me in his dimly lit office. The moment I stepped inside, I knew something was off. The man’s skin was pallid, almost translucent, and his eyes—too large, too dark—seemed to absorb the light. He didn’t bother with pleasantries or even look at my resume. He just stared at me, as if trying to see something beneath my skin.

"Are you sure you want to teach here?" he asked, his voice low and hollow, echoing in a way that made my skin crawl. "Do you really want to teach?"

Every time I nodded, my confidence wavered. There was something wrong with him—something inhuman. I told myself it was just nerves, but deep down, I knew it was more than that.

"Come tomorrow night," he finally said. "Six PM. Your first class begins then."

That night, I couldn’t sleep. My dreams were plagued by visions of dark hallways that stretched endlessly into nothingness, of faces half-seen in the shadows. I woke up drenched in sweat, Mr. Wong’s eyes still burning in my mind. But I shook it off. I needed the money. I couldn’t back out now.

The following evening, I arrived at the school just before six. In the fading light, the building looked even more sinister, its windows dark and empty like hollow eyes. The moment I stepped inside, the temperature dropped. The walls seemed to close in, and the scent of decay grew stronger.

Mr. Wong led me to a classroom at the end of a long, narrow hallway. The room was sparse, the walls stained with something I didn’t want to think about. A single, flickering bulb hung from the ceiling, casting long, distorted shadows that twisted with every movement.

"Class is from 7 PM to 2 AM," he instructed, his voice now a mere whisper, a sound that seemed to come from all around me. "You must stay in the classroom. Do not leave. Do not wander. Just sit at your desk. Understand?"

I nodded, though a deep sense of dread had settled in my gut. The hours made no sense, and the atmosphere in the room was oppressive, as if the very walls were watching me. But the money—it kept me rooted in place.

As soon as Mr. Wong left, the silence became unbearable. It wasn’t just quiet—it was an unnatural absence of sound, like the world had been muted. I tried to distract myself by arranging my materials, but the stillness pressed in on me, suffocating.

Then, I heard it—footsteps, faint at first, but growing louder, more distinct, echoing through the hallways. The students entered the room in single file, their faces pale, eyes downcast, and movements unnervingly synchronized. They took their seats without a word, their textbooks opening in unison, the pages rustling like dry leaves.

I watched them, my heart racing. There was something wrong with them—something deeply, fundamentally wrong. Their skin was too pale, their eyes too dull. When I looked directly at them, they seemed normal enough, but out of the corner of my eye, I caught glimpses of things that didn’t make sense—fingers too long, smiles that were just a bit too wide, eyes that flickered with a darkness that seemed to pulse with a life of its own.

I tried to steady my hands as I took attendance, but my voice faltered. The students responded in eerie unison, their voices hollow, echoing like a distant memory. When I reached the name Zhang Wei, no one answered. I called again, and again, the silence growing heavier with each attempt.

I turned to the nearest student. "Do you know where Zhang Wei is?"

The student didn’t move, didn’t even look up. But a voice, soft and raspy, came from the shadows at the back of the room. "Teacher…don’t call that name. Zhang Wei is gone."

My breath caught in my throat. I scanned the room, but all the students remained still, their heads bowed, their eyes fixed on their books. My heart pounded, the air growing colder with every passing second.

The footsteps returned—this time, louder, more erratic, circling the room like a predator stalking its prey. My head snapped around, my eyes darting to the door, expecting someone—something—to enter. But the doorway remained empty, the only sound the relentless, echoing steps.

"Teacher, I am here," the voice whispered, so close it felt like the breath was on my neck. I spun around, but the room was as it had been—students at their desks, faces down, silence.

Then, a figure—a student, or what resembled one—slid out of the shadows, moving toward the last empty desk. Its movements were jerky, unnatural, like a puppet with tangled strings. It sat down, head bowed, hands twitching on the desk.

I forced myself to breathe. It had to be Zhang Wei. I was just tired—imagining things. With shaking hands, I marked Zhang Wei as present, but as I did, something cold and clammy wrapped around my wrist. I gasped, the air freezing in my lungs.

"I am not Zhang Wei," the voice hissed, cold and sharp, slicing through the silence. The grip tightened, the cold seeping into my bones, numbing me to the core. "Zhang Wei is no more. My name is Liu Guan."

The hand released me, leaving my wrist burning with icy pain. I stumbled back, my heart racing, my mind screaming at me to leave, to run, to never look back. But my legs wouldn’t move—I was rooted to the spot, trapped in the oppressive darkness.

The hours dragged on, each one heavier than the last. The students sat in eerie silence, their heads never lifting, their eyes never meeting mine. When the clock struck 2 AM, the bell rang—a deep, distorted sound that reverberated through the room, vibrating in my skull.

The students rose as one, their movements stiff and mechanical, and filed out of the classroom. I hesitated for a moment, then followed them, driven by a desperate need to understand what was happening.

They led me through the darkened hallways, the walls seeming to close in around me, the air growing thicker with every step. The students moved with unsettling purpose, their feet barely touching the ground, their bodies swaying like reeds in a storm.

They led me to a building at the back of the campus, its door ajar, the darkness inside swallowing the light. Just as I was about to step inside, a voice hissed from the shadows, "Teacher…turn back. Turn back before it’s too late."

I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. I blinked, and in that instant, the students vanished, leaving me alone in the suffocating silence.

I stumbled back to the teacher’s lounge, my mind racing, my body trembling with fear. I collapsed onto the bed, but sleep offered no escape. The moment I closed my eyes, the nightmares came—visions of dark hallways, of twisted figures with too many limbs, of eyes that glowed with an unnatural light.

And then, the laughter began—high-pitched, childlike, and full of malice. It echoed in my ears, bouncing off the walls, filling my mind with a sound that was both familiar and utterly wrong. My eyes snapped open, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

The room was empty, but the laughter continued, a disembodied chorus that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. I bolted upright, cold sweat drenching my skin, but the laughter persisted, growing louder, more frenzied.

Suddenly, it stopped, leaving a silence that was even more terrifying. I lay back down, my body trembling, my mind screaming at me to leave, to get out while I still could. But sleep dragged me down once more, pulling me into a nightmare from which there was no escape.

A hand—cold as death—wrapped around my throat, squeezing until I could barely breathe. A weight pressed down on my chest, crushing the life out of me. I struggled, panic surging through me, but I was trapped, paralyzed. My eyes flickered open, but the room was pitch black.

My mind screamed in terror. I had left the light on. Why was the room dark? I fought to move, to escape, but my body was frozen, locked in place. After what felt like an eternity, the weight lifted, the icy grip releasing me.

Gasping for air, I forced myself to check the time. 5 AM. The sky outside was still dark, the village shrouded in a fog that seemed to pulse with a life of its own. I grabbed my belongings and fled, my footsteps echoing in the empty halls, the silence pressing in on me like a vice.

I reached Mr. Wong’s office and pounded on the door, my knuckles raw and bleeding. The door creaked open, revealing Mr. Wong’s pale, twisted face. His eyes glinted with a darkness that was anything but human.

"Leaving already?" he asked, his voice dripping with mockery. "The students will be disappointed."

I swallowed hard, the events of the night clawing at my sanity. "You don’t have to pay me…I just need to leave."

Mr. Wong’s smile widened, splitting his face into a grotesque grin. He handed me a few crumpled RMB notes, their texture cold and slick, like wet leaves. "But you’ve earned it. My students will miss you."

And with that, he slammed the door, the sound reverberating through the empty halls like a death knell.

I fled the school, my heart pounding, my mind screaming at me to get as far away as possible. But as I reached the edge of the campus, I stopped dead in my tracks.

The school was gone.

In its place stood a cemetery, ancient and crumbling, its tombstones weathered and cracked. At the entrance was a plaque, dark with age, the letters barely visible: "Nanyue Children’s Cemetery."

My eyes darted to the names etched into the stone, my heart sinking as I recognized them. They were the names from my attendance sheet—every single one. And at the bottom, Zhang Wei’s name was crossed out, replaced by Liu Guan’s.

A cold wind swept through the cemetery, carrying with it a whisper that sliced through the air like a blade. "Teacher…if you don’t leave…your name will join the others."

I screamed, the sound tearing through the still morning air as I bolted, running until my legs gave out. When I finally dared to look at the money Mr. Wong had given me, my breath caught in my throat.

The RMB notes had turned into joss paper, the kind burned for the dead.
