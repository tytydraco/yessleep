I need to get this out before I go back. I don’t know how much time I’ll have, or how far I’ll even make it, but I’ve decided to write everything down while I’m on the road. Gas stations, rest stops, motels—whenever I have a little downtime and enough signal, I’ll post what I have. It won’t come all at once. I’ll tell it the way it happened, because that’s the only way I can bear to think about it. By the time you’re reading this, I’ll already be on my way, retracing steps I swore I’d never take again.
———————————————————————————

I was a socially awkward kid, the kind who ate lunch away from everyone and rarely said a word. Making friends seemed like something everyone but me could do, until I met Seth. We were at school and I happened to hear him talking about the new game his mom bought him. It was a game I happened to be really into so I jumped into the conversation before I could talk myself out of it. We bonded over our love of the game and he invited me over. We’ve been best friends ever since. Lately though—because of everything that’s happened—I’ve been looking back on these early days a little less fondly. 

Seth and I spent most of our summers talking about things we’d never actually do. We made big plans and never followed through. But one day, we decided we were really going to build a treehouse.
After convincing both our parents, all that was left was finding the right spot. Behind Seth’s house was a dense pine forest, so that was the obvious choice. We searched for about half an hour through the humid, sticky, air. Trees of all shapes and sizes surrounded us as the crickets and birds sang. Eventually we stumbled into a clearing.

It looked almost too perfect—a circle, maybe fifty or seventy-five feet across. Right in the center stood an old stone well, nearly swallowed by moss. The moss was reminiscent of a giant snake, slithering its way up and down the well. 

The moment I saw it, I felt something shift. Not fear exactly, but a pull. Like it had been waiting for us.

 “Dude, this is perfect!” he said walking up to the well as if it was another blade of grass, “We can build the tree house over there—away from the creepy stone thing.”

 I wasn’t looking at the tree line though, I was still staring at the well. Seth kept rambling about treehouse ideas, but I kept drifting toward the well. As I got closer, I noticed the stone around the rim had been chiseled in a ripple pattern that spread toward the water hole. The well was about ten feet deep before dropping off into an even darker pit. I almost missed it—but as I stared at the far wall, transfixed, I saw something. There, on a narrow ledge of dirt jutting from the inner wall, sat a single black dahlia.

“Travis, what’re you doing?” Seth’s voice broke me from the trance as I staggered backwards. 

“I was just looking at this well. It’s beautiful.” 

“The well is beautiful?”

“Yeah…” Seth gave a short laugh, but it didn’t sound amused. 

“You’re kinda freaking me out man, are you getting enough sleep?”

“Yeah,” I said, not even sure if I snapped out of my trance. “I’m fine.” Seth walked up to me and looked at the well. 

“Is there anything down there?”

“Nothing really, just a flower and water.” Seth walked closer and peeked into the hole.

“What flower?” I blinked. The flower was gone. Not fallen—gone. No trace of it on the stones below, no sign of it ever being there at all. I didn’t answer him. My eyes were still locked on the place where it had been. My skin crawled. “Let’s just go back to your place, we can do this tomorrow. You’re not looking so good.” I nodded, still not fully looking away from the well. It felt like turning your back on something you’re not sure is real—or worse, something you were sure was.

We walked back to my house in near silence, occasionally breaking it to point out an animal or make some half-hearted comment about the woods. The summer heat was still heavy, but it was suddenly a lot less noticeable. The trees whispered above us, branches swaying as the wind blew across them. The air felt different—not colder or thicker, but wrong. Like something had shifted in the clearing. Something I couldn’t name, let alone understand. 

When we got to my place I told my mom I wasn’t feeling well. She offered me some soup and ginger ale but I declined. My room was familiar—posters on the wall, controller wires tangled together on the carpet, the ceiling fan clicking with every rotation, but I couldn’t settle. My mind kept circling back to the well. The flower. The way it vanished, like it had never existed at all. Seth booted up Mortal Kombat and handed me a controller. I lost every match we played. I couldn’t focus, I felt anxious, like I was being watched.

That night, I dreamt of the clearing and the well. The sky was grey and dreary and the forest was covered in shadows. I looked around and saw nothing strange so I started walking towards the well. As I approached it, black, thorny vines started slithering out of the well and approaching me. I tried to run but vines came up from the ground and wrapped around my feet. I was stuck in place as the vines started to wrap around me, cutting into my flesh. Hundreds of thorns poked into me as I collapsed into a bed of vines. The vines slowly made their way up my body. 

I screamed as thorns tore through my skin, sharp and endless. I thrashed and struggled but it only pushed them deeper into me. I eventually gave up, tears rolling down my face as I accepted my fate. Right before I was completely swallowed by the vines I saw something. A silhouette behind the tree line, human-like in shape. There was something off about it though. I stared at it as the vines slowly engulfed my entire body.

I jolted upright, chest heaving, heart slamming against my ribs. It took minutes to steady my breath, to remind myself I was safe. I grounded myself, counting each breath until I felt stable again. As I got out of bed I looked around my room. Nothing was out of the ordinary and there was nothing going on. I let out a sigh of relief before turning around. What I saw still haunts me. Sitting right there on the outside of my window, was a single Black Dahlia.
