I (34F) have always been a bit skeptical when it comes to spirits and the paranormal. But lately, something strange has been happening in my house, and I can't explain it.

It all started a few weeks ago, when I inherited an old mirror from my grandmother. At first, I was excited to have a piece of family history in my home, but soon after I brought the mirror home, I began to notice strange things happening.

It started with little things, like seeing movement out of the corner of my eye when I was alone in the room with the mirror. But then, the movement became more distinct. I started seeing shadows that seemed to dart across the surface of the glass.

One night, when I was home alone, I saw something that I couldn't explain. As I was walking past the mirror, I caught a glimpse of a figure standing behind me in the reflection. I spun around, heart pounding, but there was no one there. When I turned back to the mirror, the figure was gone.

Over the next few days, the figure appeared more frequently. She was always standing behind me, just out of focus, as if waiting for something. I started to feel like I was being watched all the time, like there was something in my house that I couldn't see.

I didn't know what to do. I tried to talk to my husband about it, but he didn't believe me. He thought I was just stressed out from work and needed to relax.

But my kids, (my little girl is six and my son is eight), believed me. They started to get scared to be in the same room as the mirror and would often ask me to cover it up or even move it to another room.

One night, when my husband was out of town, I couldn't take it anymore. I got up the courage to confront the figure in the mirror. As I approached the mirror, I could see her more clearly. She was a woman, with long dark hair and sad eyes. She looked like she was from another time.

I stood in front of the mirror, staring into her eyes. I asked her who she was and what she wanted. But she just stood there, silent and unmoving.

As I watched her, something strange happened. The glass of the mirror began to warp and twist, as if it was melting. The woman's figure started to become distorted, and then, in a flash of light, she disappeared.

After that, things went back to normal. I didn't see the movements and the woman in the mirror again, and the strange movements and shadows stopped. It’s been around a month, I haven’t got any sleep since then and I haven’t told anyone yet, I don’t want to be seen as crazy or schizophrenic.

But I can't shake the feeling that something isn't right. My kids still get scared around the mirror, and I worry that they might see something that I don’t.

If anyone has any advice, please tell me. I’ve looked around online but it seems like I can’t do anything about it, and I’m scared that getting rid of the mirror will make it worse. I can’t move somewhere else either because of financial reasons since I’m currently unemployed.

If anything else happens, I'll be sure to update this post.
