Where do I begin? Today, I feel as though I have betrayed a friend, not because I was following orders, but because I was silent and weak. I didn't act fast enough. I will use this recorder to, well, record my thoughts and emotions—unofficially, of course. After I replay it, I can fill in the report. I hope he gets what he deserves someday. I will see to it. Maybe I will get what I deserve someday too.

This incident happened today. At the time, I was working with Dr. Aisha, an expert in all things signal processing. We needed her expertise to examine the brain signals because ours was somewhat lacking. I was the only one in the facility who could handle the brain scanning and other non-invasive body scanning equipment. It's kind of funny, considering that this facility houses patients who need help. I guess at the time, having one person who could do it well for, say, 15 people was considered highly efficient. But I say they are pretty cheap, considering how much they paid for these facilities.

I remember the day that Dr. Aisha arrived. January 6. Beautiful lady. Full of spirit. Wasn't afraid to criticize any of us for our mistakes or failures. Sure, it stung a little, but that's how it works in the research and development field. Better than getting criticized by Dr. Campbell, though. He's a real pain when he wants to be. Screams at you when something isn't remotely perfect.

But I digress. Both Dr. Aisha and I had been examining patient 20133 for roughly one or two months. He was an unstable fellow, kept talking in riddles. He insisted that something would come after him someday. He wasn't sure what or who would come after him but told us he would end it when that day came. He wanted us to guarantee his death when he made that claim.

Mind you, he had been making this claim for months, even before I was assigned to him. He said that everything changed when he was visited by a man during a routine eye exam. Before losing his grip on reality, he was a functioning member of society—specifically, an eye doctor, an optometrist. Long story short, patient 20133 started seeing things, visions perhaps, after that visit.

The man who visited the patient is currently classified as unknown subject 623, possibly related to sample 4662. How, we are unsure. Hence our interest in patient 20133. Subject 623 gave the patient a small black crystal. Every attempt to take it from him for analysis has led to aggressive and even violent responses. One of our caretakers was severely injured with a broken arm a few days ago while trying to take the crystal. Dr. Campbell instructed us to halt any attempts at confiscation to avoid unnecessary injury.

Fortunately, Dr. Aisha was able to negotiate with patient 20133, allowing us to study the crystal as long as he was present wherever it was. He told us that he was tied to it, bound by it. We didn't understand it at the time. Hell, I still don't understand it even after everything that has happened.

That black crystal—how can such beauty hide such terror and power?

Well, today, the patient started screaming bloody murder. He told me the day had come, that he felt something was wrong today. "It's here! But I won't answer! Kill me now!" This is what he kept shouting to himself all day. I put the brain scanner on his head, which can read electromagnetic signals in the brain. Though tweaked based on classified technology acquired from special sources, it not only reads electromagnetic signals in the brain but can also read their thoughts and display them as images. However, this required the use of wavelet transforms and intricate fine-tuning in order to do this, which varies wildly from patient to patient. I don't really understand the math behind it, but Dr. Aisha definitely did.

As she was reading the scanner and doing her magic, I noticed something wrong with the patient. He kept staring at the wall behind me, fixated on it as if something was there. I remember that I kept looking over my shoulder several times but saw nothing each time. However, the feeling of fear and unease washed over me, indicating that something was really there, behind me. Dr. Aisha didn't seem to notice as she was focused on reading the scanner.

"We need to get out of here. Something's wrong. Can't you feel it?" I told her.

"No. But there's something wrong with this patient. His signals are all reading normal. But his thoughts, they're all incohesive. All over the place. It's like something is scrambling his brain. It makes no sense. Can you grab me the secondary probe attachment? Let's see if we can refine the signal to the fourth or fifth order," she replied.

I didn't understand what she meant, but I grabbed it without hesitation. I was hoping that the sooner she finished her task, the faster we could get the hell out of there. She didn't stop though and kept working for about ten minutes. It felt excruciating. However, I felt relief at first when Dr. Campbell approached the entrance of the patient's room and said, "Dr. Aisha, will you excuse us for a minute? I need to have a chat with our technician here."

Dr. Aisha didn't say a word. As we exited the room, Dr. Campbell spoke to me, "It's always the researchers. Whenever they study anything remotely related to sample 4662, they become hypnotized. It's quite fascinating to watch really. This one should be interesting. Dr. Aisha has become too... connected with the patient. We shall observe what happens next."

I remember pausing, staying silent. I should have protested. I should have stopped him. But I was baffled by what he meant. Was he going to use Dr. Aisha as a guinea pig?

That's when he used his keycard and activated the patient emergency lock. The door slid shut, and the lock clicked loudly. Dr. Aisha didn't turn around at first; she was still glued to her laptop. Then suddenly, I heard a shrill cry of fear from her. She quickly stood up and ran towards the door. I will never forget her words, "Please let me out! They're coming! Please God! Don't let them take me away!"

And that's when I protested? How weak am I? I should have done it the second he locked the door. But protest I did. I begged Dr. Campbell to release her, but he ignored me—that bastard ignored me! Just when I was about to forcefully grab his keycard, I saw a brilliant light shine from the wall of the room that the patient kept looking at. That light—I can't describe it to you properly—it was emitting all sorts of colors: red, green, yellow, purple. It should have been illuminating the entire room, but only that part of the wall was bright; every other part of the room went dark. I could make out Dr. Aisha as she was still staring at us through the other side of the door—but not the patient.

That's when I noticed the patient walking towards the light out of the darkness of the room, seemingly hypnotized by it. The moment he touched the bright wall, something appeared to be sucked out of his body—like a transparent version of himself, almost as if his soul was being pulled right out. It seemed excruciatingly painful; I could see the pure agony on his face. No scream, no sound came from him, but that face—oh my God, that face. It transformed from a silent man screaming in terror to a visage of just skin and bone, with no eyes. It was as if his flesh slowly and painfully disappeared from his body.

I saw Dr. Aisha turn around. I could hear her begging for her life, "Please let me live. I did nothing wrong. All we did was keep the patient here, keep him healthy. We didn't isolate him! He chose this life. He chose not to look at the crystal. We had nothing to do with it. Please. Please let me go."

That's when I saw something emerge from the bright wall. It looked like a man, but he was dark—much darker than the wall or the surrounding darkness in the room. His curves were not smooth like typical humans; they were jagged and crooked, as if he was made out of crystal. Despite his terrifying appearance, there was an unsettling beauty to him, reminiscent of the black crystal the patient held. I looked at its face as much as I could bear. It looked very familiar.

But I was interrupted as that thing suddenly appeared to punch a hole into Dr. Aisha’s chest. I didn’t see blood, but her screams—she made this horrific, blood-curdling scream. I covered my ears. I remember looking at Dr. Campbell and seeing how unmoved he was by the whole scene. How could he look at that so coldly? So inhumanely?

That's when I saw something transparent, like a ghost, start to leave her body. Again, it looked like her soul was being sucked out of her by this wretched thing. However, it felt like it lasted ten times as long compared to the patient's gruesome fate. I could see that her body was slowly losing its flesh. In the end, her body ended up being mummified.

After that, a bright flash of white light blinded both me and Dr. Campbell, and that thing disappeared. What was left were the two mummified corpses on the ground.

Not even a second of silence after this grisly scene, Dr. Campbell spoke to me, "I need you to write an incident report on what you saw today. Keep it as technical and as clean as possible."

Then, he whispered to me, "I saw your attempted aggression against me. You wanted to save her. Risk everything that we’ve been working on. I won’t forget that. But I will let it slide… for now."

That bastard started walking away and whistling after speaking to me. I just stood there, silently, trying to take it all in.

That was two hours ago.

I still haven’t written anything down. But I did pull out the old incident report made at the optics lab to confirm my suspicions. Here it is, the face of the optics researcher before his gruesome, mummified fate. He was the person I saw in the room with Dr. Aisha and patient 20133 today.

I remember hearing Dr. Campbell grumbling about going to another lab to supervise Dr. Aisha’s colleague today. He didn’t mention their name. I will try to finish this report quickly and speak to someone. Maybe Saed? I think he can transfer me to another station before Dr. Campbell comes back.

But I need to repent for my sins. How can I do that? How can I beg for Dr. Aisha’s forgiveness?
