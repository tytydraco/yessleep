So before I can go into details, I guess I have to first explain how I met Andrew. Andrew isn't his real name - he said he couldn't tell me his real name when I asked him.

This all began when I was 13 or so, until then I was just a regular boy. I didn't have a care in the world. I remember how the day started, I was in school, everything was normal - until 6th period.

I remember it was math class, I'm pretty sure that Mr. Anderson was teaching us the Pythagorean Theorem, and I was doing exactly what every 13 year old boy does when learning the Pythagorean Theorem - wonder how the hell it would apply to the real world, and why I would need to know that a² + b² = c².

And I began to doze off.

I was awoken by a figure - he appeared to be humanoid, 7 feet tall, very skinny, and he appeared to be made of a black, sludge like material.

When it spoke to me it had a deep, raspy voice, and it sounded like if you were gurgling water in your throat, but if that was the case - I was surprised he managed to speak at all.

It spoke up. "Hello Mason."

I was still taking a moment to process my surroundings, Mr. Anderson's empty classroom, the countless erasers that were flung across the room by the other students, and Mr. Anderson's surprisingly clean desk.

I finally piped up to speak to the monstrous looking creature.

"Hello." I continued with, "What the hell are you?"

The creature spoke up, sounding as excited as a boiling voiced monster can sound.

"Oh wow." It said. It followed up with, "Wait you can see me?"

"Yea man, I can see you." I answered, followed by "You still never answered my question."

"What the hell are you?"

It responded with "I cannot tell you my name, as it has been long since forgotten. I walk the afterlife. My purpose, to guide you away from ill intent. Perhaps since I don't know my name, you could give me one?"

I took a moment to process what he had just told me.

After a long silence, I finally managed to speak.

"Andrew?" I asked

"Andrew." Said the proclaimed spirit, accepting his new name.

Curiosity eating at me, I had to inquire how Andrew became what he appeared to be.

"So Andrew, how did you die?" I asked him.

He answered, "It was the sixth of June, 1944. Today was D-Day. The beginning of Operation Overlord. I was part of Operation Neptune, the frontal assault on the beaches of Normandy, France."

He paused for a moment, somehow sounding clearly shooken by recounting his past.

He continued "I was a Lance Corporal of the United States military - just another piece of cannon fodder to be used for the day." Andrew stopped for a moment before continuing with his story. "The Higgins boat that I was placed on was supposed to hit Utah Beach - instead we got drifted around at sea and ended up landing at Omaha."

I sat there stunned, as Andrew was recounting historical events perfectly, detail by detail. I knew he was not lying about his past.

Andrew continued with the story of his passing, "As soon as the ramp on the Higgins boat dropped, everyone in the boat was immediately fired at." He paused, a single sludgy black tear falling down his face. "There was bodies everywhere, mortars exploding back to back, cries of wounded soldiers barely out of highschool asking for their mothers, and big metal x shaped Czech Hedgehogs."

He spoke one more time, saying "I didn't even make it to the seawall - a mortar got me, I was alive, and then I wasn't. It was simple - sweet release."

I struggled to mouth my words, "I'm sorry" I said.

He just told me, "No worries, Mason - but I gotta go." He followed up with, "I'll talk to you tonight, in your sleep."

And then I woke back up in Mr. Anderson's full math class.
