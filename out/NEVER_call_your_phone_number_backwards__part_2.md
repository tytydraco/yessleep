I didn't sleep yesterday night. I mean, how could you rest when a real-life nightmare is playing out in front of you. It wasn't like I was entirely alert and conscious either. I would drift off into these micro-naps, or whatever you call them, 2 minutes or less of completely zoning out, and after waking from these mini-trances, I would see myself standing in the corner of my room. I shrugged it off as "just seeing things", even though something deep inside me knew that the figure was real. Something from another realm slipping into my universe. My home. My bedroom. 

  
I spent pretty much all day googling. Looking up "phone number backwards challange" gave me results from tech support websites with advice on changing your phone number or something like that. So I scrolled deeper and found an old forum. CreepyCreepies.net. There was a post on it. One from 2015, made by Victoria879. I recognized that username. Rachel's older sister who went missing after a supposed psychotic break. She had a YouTube channel, on which she went by the same name, and posted videos mostly consisting of makeup and fashion tips. I know, because Rachel showed it to me on her birthday last year. She would be 25 if she were alive today. Anyways, here is her post:

  
So, I decided to try this challange in which you call your phone number backwards. Apparently, it's supposed to do something weird and cause some sort of curse from an alternate universe, I guess... But nothing happened, at least for now. I'm safe, haven't seen anything odd yet, hehe :)

  
After reading the post, my heart sank. I understood why Rachel, the "brave one" didn't do the challange. She lost her sister to it. That "psychotic break" wasn't a psychotic break at all. It was real all along, and it's happening to me right now. I went to her profile to see more. The last thing she posted was a picture. Of a figure that looked like her in the backyard, captioned with 3 terryfying words: THIS. ISN'T. ME. Posted on the same day she went missing, December 3, 2015. I scrolled down. A video of her mirror being out of sync. A post asking if seeing your face in a crowd is normal. All of these things lined up with what was happening to me, and pretty much my entire friendgroup. 

  
I FaceTimed Rachel. Apparently, she thought that this was the silly kind of FaceTime, because she was wearing her unicorn pajamas while in full clown makeup (she's a makeup artist, so she does these kinds of looks as a hobby). But unfortunately, it was the serious kind. 

   
Soo... remember your sister Victoria? - I asked.

Yeah, how could I forget her? She's my angel sis! - She replied, clearly not yet understanding the severity of the situation.

She, um... did the same challange...that I did... - I asked hesitantly, not wanting to trigger her.

I know...That's why I didn't try it. Everyone says it's psychosis, but it's more. It's REAL - She replied.

Well, I just found some new, very uh...convincing evidence - I turned my phone towards the laptop, showing her the things she posted. 

  
Oh... I haven't seen that before...And that picture of her...WAIT... it's not her...It's the TWIN. I remember seeing her face in places it wasn't supposed to be when I was 6, when she had her "psychotic break". It happened once or twice, but wasn't as... intense, I guess... - I hung up on her. My mom was calling me from downstairs. 

  
"Sweetie, are you OK? I made gingerbread cookies, do you wanna decorate them with your younger brother?"

  
I came downstairs crying. I hugged her so tight. I couldn't put into words what was happening. She didn't ask. How can I explain this whole thing to her? I feel like she deserves to know.
