Somebody much smarter than me was quoted saying food is tradition, something holy, that it shares our honesty, that it’s the soul of a city and central to mankind and the most important trademark of culture, that it tells you everything about the way a people live and who they are, and to understand all that, you need to taste it.

They were said on a travel show hosted by a celebrity chef who went from locale to locale worldwide tasting each’s food and pontificating on the significance meals held to those who lived there, and my place was featured on an episode paying a visit to Charleston, the host calling Denmark Vesey’s Revenge a hidden gem, which was hardly true since my joint was deemed a lowcountry staple by local food critics and voted top spots of the ‘best-of’ area restaurants by residents years running. After the airing, I gained national notoriety, cementing my place’s status in the Holy City. 

The chef, when interviewing me between bites of barbecue, asked if there was any importance to building my establishment in a converted church and I told him that my momma found the upper peninsula property on Rutledge Avenue cheap back when I first started, adding that while Charleston was known as the Holy City for its high number of churches, it really was a mecca for food lovers searching for a religious experience they lacked and I made death taste good. The chef laughed and called my barbecue heavenly and then asked about the meaning of Denmark Vesey’s Revenge and as I thought on an answer, I heard the rumbling of a train in the distance followed by the bellow of its warning horn and I remembered a similar conversation I had with momma after we did what we did, and I gave a name to my wooden food stand I had as a kid. Momma loved that it honored my little brother but had reservations. “Reckon it’s too crass?” she said.

I listed all the locations and streets named after plantations and Confederates. “They’ll see it as a delightful irony,” I said. “If they know in the first place.”

“No questions?”

“I’ll distract them. Tell them what they want to hear.”

Momma looked at me, skeptically. “How?” she said.

“Y’all hungry?” I said. “I got right what you need.”

I didn’t share this with the chef and stayed coy because the truth of the matter was too dark to shed light on and I related a half-fabrication written for my cookbook involving a thwarted uprising and my little brother and the answer satisfied the chef who expounded on his notion of food as death giving the living life. I listened patiently and smiled for the cameras and extended monosyllabic utterances and curt head nods and excitedly watched the chef devour everything on his plate and when he asked me, Esau Seneca, what makes your barbecue stand out? I was reminded of my daddy and I told the chef I’m older than either of my parents lived to, a milestone, so I want to make them proud.  

I was raised with a differing opinion than the chef, my daddy stressing food was viewed from a point of privilege and eaten with comfort, never necessity. “Hunger and humanity’s quest to quench it, often violently, is the ignored aspect,” he said. “And in that blindness, culinary inventions are inappropriately elevated to cultural importance.” 

He declared certain dishes forbidden to grace his table because forced tradition based on appalling circumstances wasn’t to be celebrated, though his stance was a tad ironic as he considered food the promise of tomorrow earned through killing, proving his outlook by showing me and my little brother the best place to get about crabbing was a minor inlet off the Cooper River near our upper peninsula community of Wegener Terrace. 

The reason it was so good to set our peeler tanks in this spot being that it was fed by a series of creeks that ran through the graveyards making up the Magnolia Cemetery where centuries of corpses decayed and seeped those good nutrients into the soil that leaked into the snaking waterways and dumped all the detritus in this here cove, which was inhabited by several different coastal creatures feeding amongst the spartina, including the desired blue crabs. Me and Vesey, so named for the freedman who was hanged for allegedly planning a slave revolt, waded through the egg-rot stinking pluff mud up to our knees to our traps, our bodies soaked in sweat and sea salt, and gathered these jimmies and sooks that were two to three times the normal size and sold them at a nameless roadside stand along Meeting Street, popular to the area folks because we was two kids be setting up a minuscule wood booth with a burner to boil the crabs right there for a minimal price, customers bearing warped plastic chairs and uneven plastic tables under the harsh lowcountry sun to be delighted in the crabmeats’ juicy, rich and salty flavors. I couldn’t tell you if we’d’ve revealed our secret it was all spawned by the dead because no one asked. They just ate.

Despite this here act of kindness, my daddy possessed no noble qualities. An astute yet harsh man, he was angry the cruel world he grew up in kept betraying him. In the Holy City, you’re money adjacent and after a time you suppose you’re deserved a portion and my daddy believed he was a rich man in a poor man’s body. Momma had her church, which she saw as enough reward until she lost that when her ministry shuttered and the congregants scattered, and my daddy’s get-rich-quick schemes busted in the usual failures as he assumed he was smart enough to con his way up the social ladder. Momma, having placed her stock in her family, bailed him out and I was old enough to know he was a waste though momma assured me he’d learn, and he told us he’d go back to cooking only for him to brew up more ways to steal food from our mouths thinking he could rise above his station. 

One night, reeking of cheap booze, he stumbled into the bedroom me and Vesey shared and shook us awake to tell us his daddy warned that surviving a hanging meant you never escape the rope, and we better get about making money, that he tired of us tightening his noose. He blamed his family for his failings and when he wasn’t beating me and momma and Vesey, he was stepping out with women he charmed pretending to be a success, treating them with respect and love and kindness he denied us. I barely recall his face, my memories consisting mostly of the letdowns and brutality he delivered, turning our slanting, ramshackle single house into a chamber of violence, and the bargain-bin cigarettes glued to his lower lip cooking supper he thought momma ruined, smoke pouring from his mouth and curling around his head as he rambled in his deep, gravelly voice, the voice of god, Vesey believed, at the kitchen stovetop doused in sweat and stinking of cheap cologne to mask the ashtray stench and reek of fish from the seafood restaurant he spent a portion of his days in when he wasn’t a private chef for a prominent blueblood or cavorting with his harem of paramours, and as much as I hated him, he was right about how the world operated. Death was the lifeblood of existence and this shaped how we carried on our long days and so my daddy was the first one I served.  

I might’ve apprenticed with the best pitmasters in Nashville and Memphis and Atlanta, but it was momma who made me. While my daddy was a kitchen connoisseur, momma was a true genius who compelled me to get out of the Holy City to study and start my BBQ spot when I returned, she assembled the capital and found the location and drummed up support to keep the place afloat during those initial hard years. She’d been an ambitious and dynamic young woman, it was what drew my daddy to her originally, but his trouble was worse, and he broke her and transformed her into the quiet and battered and scared and unseen mother who raised me and Vesey. 

With him gone, though, she triumphed over the wreckage of her life and reverted to her vigorous self to rediscover her passion for food, especially meat, especially meat with the right amount of smokiness and expert rub, especially meat that’s tender and juicy and firm with good exterior bark and fat that’s been properly rendered. She came from a long line of pitmasters that went back to the Holy City’s founding and the people who built it, her daddy revealing what his daddy was taught by his daddy and his daddy before him, and I was imparted her ancestral knowledge hands-on the night she revived her appetite, the experience bonding me to her more than any of the other moments in my short life up to that time, save for one, when Vesey died. Constructing a pit for a whole-hog barbecue, which momma and her forebearers favored, helped us overcome his suicide.  

Preparation was key, that’s what momma told me the first time she took me in the dead night to a parcel of land across the Cooper River from the peninsula to ready the pit. Mount Pleasant had long been an agrarian backwater until it became a rich enclave and momma parked at a metal gate and exited our truck and tore down a faded, green-blotched ‘For Sale’ sign and left the pieces to rot amongst Spanish moss and tall grass overgrowth.

The ten acres of pristine countryside was smack dab in the middle of rapid urbanization my daddy’d been trying to sell to whichever smooth-talking developer promised the most riches, but momma was stalwart in not signing, sickened so many others were hoodwinked into giving up prime real estate for pennies only to see their legacies transformed into hideous housing developments and strip malls with names that betrayed the heritages they were built on. This was where momma grew up with her parents and ten siblings and she was the only one left. Despite the carbon-copy dwellings and empty storefronts surrounding us, the tract was littered with thick old-growth oaks that kept the land private, the natural, untamed aesthetic flourishing. Only the distant rumbling of night trains evidenced the outside world. 

The plot was lush and green and smelled wet and earthy, and the air was filled the trills of frogs and insects and we worked by headlights swiftly constructing the pit where the tall grass was most trampled, and we built the cinderblocks structure and covered the ground inside with sand and placed the bars and pit grate and heat shield and cover in the proper setting and we were doused in a slick foulness that matched the stink that rose from the pluff mud in the nearby marsh by the time it was completed. I gulped water and collected my strength, too excited to feel exhaustion, and watched momma as she started a feeder fire in a burn barrel and got the wood as hot as hellfire and used a shovel to transport the embers to the pit, ash and sparks filling the sky, and spread them coals out and told me to lower the tailgate and everything smelled of smoke as we carried the corpse, which we’d messily prepared at home shaving and washing and removing the head and limbs and innards and splitting it down the middle until it didn’t look like it had no more, to the pit and carefully set it atop the grate and the flesh immediately began to sizzle and cook and a sweet-aroma mixed with the smokiness and momma told me to keep a close eye to make sure the skin didn’t blister and she maintained the feeder fire and every so while, she put her hand over the pit to feel the heat and added embers to the cooler areas to maintain an even temperature and showed me how to gauge whether the flames required fuel and she was patient in teaching me after murdering my daddy and fixing him up with her to be barbecued like he was nothing more than a hog. 

Oddly, none of this bothered me and I was eager to absorb her knowledge and the whole process lasted through the wisps of morning appearing at the horizon into the full day, momma flipping the body halfway, and I tried to nap but the sunlight was unbroken and brutal and the flies were relentless. I gave up on sleep, and momma, showed me how to dispose castoff deep in the swamp where gators and vermin and insects would eradicate the unneeded and once my daddy was fully rendered tender and succulent, we took him off the pit and set him on a tarp on the truck bed and peeled the meat from the bones and in Carolina-style fashion, chopped it, skin and all, into morsels we piled into pans and served with my momma’s baked beans and collard greens and corn pudding along with my sole contribution to the whole affair, a sweet and tangy sauce that was a mixture of vinegar and Dr. Pepper, at my food stand along Meeting Street where regulars were even more keen to pay for first servings and second helpings than they were for the blue crabs and we sold out in a few hours, each bite witnessed purifying me and momma, each customer begging us when we’d be satisfying them again. Momma fielded the question. “In time,” she said.  

I don’t know why I knew this wasn’t a one-off, yet I was surprised to return to the stand so soon with another round of barbecue the following week. Momma told me it was how she coped, ensuring the people who took her boy were punished, my daddy first as he made the initial offer of my little brother, with Archibald Legare next since it was Vesey’s interactions with the sartorially splendid blueblood that compelled him to cede his life. I saw the bruises and the distant look in Vesey’s eyes, and he told me I was too old when our daddy struck the devil’s bargain and I saw the aftermath of my little brother walking to the rail line near where we collected blue crabs and laying his neck on the track as a CSX freight train rolled through and I was struck with how much blood was in such a tiny body and how small a head looked when it wasn’t attached and how blood looked like rust when left to air and the hordes of flies that swarmed. 

Vesey shared with momma his dealings, and she vowed she’d never divulge and she confronted my daddy after Vesey was buried and their argument shook the house, and when it reached a pinnacle, the shouts abruptly stopped and I heard a metal clang followed by loud thud and when I rushed to the kitchen, my daddy was splayed out on the floor unmoving with a caved-in skull while momma undressed his corpse, a dented frying pan resting in pooled blood on the tabletop. “He wasn’t your daddy no more,” she said. “He was a corruption.” 

She told me a legend that’d been passed down through her family about the obayifo and egbere, the former a shifty creature obsessed with food and wealth while the latter are industrious spirits who possess a magical mat that grants riches to anyone who owns it, and the eternal struggle between them where the obayifo, already fattened and affluent on hoardings, attempts to trick the egbere into surrendering their gatherings and treasure but is thwarted by its indolence and starves to death and is consumed by its adversaries as reward for their toils, and I waited in the kitchen doorway as momma worked and spoke and when she finished, her story done, my daddy was nude, items in a pile by his feet, and she stood and handed me a knife. “You have a lot of learning to do,” she said. “First, start cutting.”

I was nervous then but when we took care of Legare, my hand was steady. Legare was old money, his family’s tracings initiating at the Holy City’s formation. He lived alone in an inherited waterfront mansion with a spectacular antebellum exterior on Murray Street at the tip of the peninsula, and we were ordered to use a hidden drive and the servants’ entrance in the back and the vast insides made me feel miniscule and smelled of years of structural rot and woodsmoke and stale newsprint and each room was lifeless and empty but for an accumulation of human detritus collecting dust and I almost saw ghosts of the uniformed domestics scurrying about to maintain the household and momma told me to mind my manners, the paintings of the Legare progenitors hung on the walls watching us with keen interest, subjects in the portraits growing ugly and fashionless as the years regressed. 

The centuries-old floorboards underfoot were worn soft and creaked with the slightest amount of pressure applied and momma showed me how to move silently by looking for the dulled spots in the surface sheen where eons of others marked safe passage and we became a pair of sneaks and Legare flinched when we happened on him in the dining room, where he sat ahead a barren table of grand scale with a bottle of bourbon and a filled glass of sparkling amber in front of him. He didn’t bother asking about our presence instead of my daddy’s, but momma thought it polite to provide an explanation. 

Legare listened to the blare of the train horn in the far off and the thunderous rolls of the wheels on the tracks before he waved her off midsentence without looking at her. “As long as you serve me,” he said. “I don’t care the faces doing the work.” 

“Y’all hungry?” I said. “I got right what you need.”

Legare studied me hungrily for a second but soured upon closer inspection and veered indifferent with demands for shrimp and okra and fried corn cakes and Gullah rice and peaches and cream pie my daddy prepared, and I grumbled about the charlatan barring that food for us yet gladly preparing it for this scoundrel and momma told me to hush and assured Legare we’d get that all prepared promptly, and he shooed us off. 

We primed our materials in the kitchen as Legare watched the sunset over harbor from his overlook and waited for his meal sipping bourbon and humming to pass the time as the clamor of a train faded and because he had his back to the kitchen door, he was unaware of us drawing near and didn’t react when I brought a heavy-duty meat tenderizer down on his head, killing him. We dragged the corpse into the kitchen to prepare for loading into the truck and transport to the family acreage. “We going to get caught for this one?” I said. 

“No,” momma said. “I used to clean this house and Legare didn’t recognize me or offer condolences. He’s no security. He’s no staff. He’s no friends. No one knows we’re here.”

“We know.”

“We’re nothing but domestics, subservient to the whims of our perceived betters, best unseen and unheeded, moving between the spaces.”

“Why?”

“The corrosive nature of wealth, it’s a poison that contaminates everything and falsely inflates your sense self and security and capacities and societal prominence and turns your eyes blind to everything else because you believe you’re invulnerable and owed impunity due to all your alleged hard work despite the inherited nature of lineaged monies.”

It was the first I’d heard momma speak on these matters with such determination and confidence and vigor, even when yelling at my daddy that final time, but I couldn’t decide if all this’d been brewing, waiting for implementation, or was a spurred moment. “His family’s going to ask questions,” I said.

“The richer, the more isolated you become both by design and twist of fate,” momma said. “The older the treasure, the more callous you’re to hoard it. You’re hated by your children and former spouses for your cheapness and the general populace is unconcerned, and when anyone notices you’re gone, your kin’ll be more than happy to let you go so they can descend like turkey vultures to divvy and claim and fight over your valuable leftovers.”

We wrapped Legare tight in a tarp we tied off and got about cleaning the carnage we generated and wiped down what we touched and departed, our flight concealed by both the dark and apathy, the latter an odd hypocrisy that enveloped the Holy City as it was innate to be nosy in these parts of the peninsula, where folks were gluttonous for weakness and gossip, but it was detached, and onlookers shied from involvement less the spotlight be turned on them. It took a month for Legare to be declared missing and he was long disposed of and digested, and the rest unfolded as momma predicted, his relations battling over his fortune, the case into his disappearance closed. 

After Legare was kindly barbecued, momma sat me at the kitchen table where we’d sliced my daddy unrecognizable and she poured me my first glass of red wine and showed me how to toast and I took my first sip and cringed, and momma smiled. “Remember this moment, our cause, grow your skills,” she said. “No one’s the right to squirrel most everything and leave the rest scraps to squabble over all the while eyeing those morsels resentful. I say our social betters are nothing more than victuals. Let’s learn them that.”

My business has been booming since that conversation and no one considers how I procure my procurements. Few professions permit you to operate in such secrecy, but cooking is one. If people aren’t getting sick and you keep sanitary conditions and a clean kitchen with the necessary backdrops to maintain the artifice for health inspectors, everything else can remain a mystery. 

People respect the process and crave the unknown and want to be surprised, have their expectations exceeded while trying to figure it all out, pretending to be smarter than the trick. I hide in my simplicity, offering culinary enchantment. Meat is meat and for those who do inquire to its providence, I tell them it’s locally sourced. 

My daddy liked to say that operating in the unthinkable is a true freedom and the obviousness of your actions is only in hindsight, when the impossible is uncovered and turned possible. 

Momma and I achieved all the things she was refused, and despite our fortunes, we stayed humble, not become what we ate, never expanding beyond our one restaurant, living close by and investing in our community, but my initial question rankled me, whether the hush-hush part was delectable additive or been the plan the whole time, but when I got enough guts to ask, momma died in her sleep as a train distantly rolled by. She said you could change minds with a good meal, change the course of history, and thus, as old monies are replaced by new monies and repeat the same mistakes, I reckon, I’ve an endless supply to remake tomorrow. 

The rich, they’re like the jimmies and sooks me and Vesey used to pluck from the peeler tanks we dropped in the tiny inlet near the Magnolia Cemetery, fattened and ripened from feeding on the dead, unaware they’re the bottom of the food chain, not the top. A holy position, if you ask me, makes us honest, that when we reach such heights, we become the soul of a city, central to mankind’s survival, an important trademark of culture, feeding it, showing the rest how we live, who we are, and you learn all of this with just a simple taste. 

So, y’all hungry? I got right what you need. It’s the best in Charleston.
