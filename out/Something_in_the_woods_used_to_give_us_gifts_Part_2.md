My dreams are getting worse. The figure in the window is closer. I can see it now. I can see *her* now. A woman with long, matted hair and a face hidden mostly in shadow. I can faintly see her mouth moving in a way that looks like she’s speaking, but I can’t hear her. I can’t hear anything at all. Just like that day when we found the house, when Sophie went missing. Silence. That’s how it usually is lately. But last night, in my dream, I did something different. I leaned closer to the window to hear what she was saying. My breath fogged the cold glass. 

BANG. Her hand slammed against the glass, her face inches from mine, eyes wild, mouth open in a silent scream. I screamed and stumbled backwards, waking up as I hit the ground both in the dream and in my real life. I looked up from the floor of my room towards my window and for just a second, I could’ve sworn I saw her silhouette looking back at me. I blinked and she was gone. 

That was last night. I didn’t go back to sleep, just started packing for my visit home this weekend. I had been planning to leave that afternoon, but I didn’t want to be alone any longer than I had to. I just got here an hour ago and Mom is already making me go through boxes of stuff to make sure I didn’t forget anything I needed for college. She said she’s happy to keep anything I want here, but she wants me to make sure I didn’t accidentally leave anything important. I don’t know, she just worries about me. 

I asked her if I could go through Dad’s old stuff to take something of his with me. I told her it would make me feel more at home there. She hesitated, then agreed. My dad passed away when I was ten. I always looked up to him, admiring the way he spoke so gently, yet his presence always commanded the attention and respect of everyone in the room. He was quiet, but never meek, and always felt larger than life. Eight years after his death, I still get choked up sometimes thinking about him. 

I climbed up to the attic and unearthed one of the boxes labeled “Rick”. The box I had grabbed was filled with photos, some framed, others not, all carefully placed to keep them from getting bent. I flipped over one photo of my parents standing in front of a Christmas tree and saw it had been labeled. *Rick and Maggie’s first Christmas together, 1999.* I flipped over some more and saw they all had writing on the back, the same perfect cursive handwriting that I knew belonged to my mom. I kept looking through the photos, flipping over the ones not in frames to read the backs. *Rick reading to Eli, 2011. Our wedding, 2002. Eli’s first bike, 2014. Rick’s birthday, 2009.* 

I picked up a photo of someone I didn’t recognize. She had dark hair cut short, framing her round face. Her smile was so wide that her eyes were nearly closed. In her arms was a baby wearing a bib with the number one on it. I flipped it over and read my mom’s handwriting on the back. *Eli’s first birthday, 2008*. That baby was me? Who was the woman holding me? She looked nothing like my mom. I thought about bringing the photo to my mom and asking, but it was in Dad’s box, and I knew she still struggled to talk about anything related to him, so I just placed it in the box with the other things I planned to take with me to my dorm. I moved on to looking through the other boxes, trying to ignore the weird feeling I got from that photo. 

Sometime this weekend, I want to go looking for that trailer. I think if I can find that house and prove that it’s just an abandoned trailer, maybe I can make the nightmares stop. I’m not really sure what else to do.
