I've been trying to record my experience in a post for hours, because it left me with a flood of thoughts swirling around in my brain. I feel like it's best that I just get to the point and start right at the beginning of events. It has been about a week since it happened, when I got a restricted delivery right as I stepped through my door to leave for work.

&#x200B;

First weird thing that stood out to me is that even though it was a restricted delivery, which means it's supposed to be, well, taken good care of, this package was tattered and discolored, as if it was on its way to me since the 50's. As if that wasn't enough, the contents of it made me feel like I was about to swallow my own tongue.

&#x200B;

"Dear Sir/Madam, you are hereby invited to say your last goodbyes to (I won't mention my friend's name here) after their untimely passing" it read, followed by the date and the location. It was devastating news, as is any news of someone you knew passing away, but what's even worse is that there wasn't even a single word about what happened, because it was definitely not of natural causes, "It couldn't be!" I thought, although I haven't kept in constant contact with this friend, he was supposed to be perfectly healthy, in his mid 20's, therefore foul play and accidents are the only options left and it feels like this is something that should be mentioned.

&#x200B;

So when the day came, I drove to the specified location, still in disbelief of where I'm going, I arrived 15 minutes early, I thought that was respectfully early but not overly early, I mean, I have never actually been to a funeral since I was really young. I saw a few people already taking seats in the hall, and seeing the type of casket on the table at the very end of the room with a bright, almost heavenly light shining on it that it would be an open casket funeral, although there was no cadaver, but I was early, so it's probably still being prepared to be presentable, and we'll be asked to leave the hall while they place the body right? Right.

Ten minutes passed and a crowd filled each row of seats, turning the beige room into almost a dark void. Meanwhile, no cadaver arrived, on the other hand the eulogist did, probably to tell us to temporarily leave the hall or that's what I thought, but no, he started the ceremony by unveiling the memorial display but, it was empty. Correction, only my friend was missing from it. At first I thought it was a malicous edit by a salty underpaid employee and was about to make a scene and then the terrifying fact fully reached my brain. Everyone around me was mourning, crying, blowing their noses, reminiscing about old times.

&#x200B;

Could they not see that the subject of the ceremony was lacking in their "last moments present with us" as the eulogist put it? I was deeply uncomfortable and as the funeral went on and I kept glancing at the casket it grew into panic and confused fear that manifested itself as sweat droplets all over my back, which despite the heat of the outside temperature and my suit kept feeling like it was ice cold.

&#x200B;

After what feels like forever it was over. As if released from my chains of torment, I leapt up from my seat with a gasp. I ran up to the memorial display, quickly placed the flowers I brought, said goodbye to "Mr. NoShow" and ran home to smoke away the stress and pass out. When I awoke the next day I was sure to find myself realizing it was one of those dreams that felt all too real. Unfortunately it was quite the opposite, as I checked my mail, I saw the local newspaper of our district with an obituary, of my friend whom once again was not visually present where he should be.

&#x200B;

I could not just accept this, I started calling some attendees with the guise of asking if they're okay, but really I just wanted to check if they'd only acted like part of a crowd just as I did or did they really not sense that anything was wrong, unfortunately the worst was confirmed. Not only that, but even when their name was mentioned it sounded as if it was distorted, it was as if he was a drawing in a comic book panel that got erased but the other characters still acted like he was there. It was an awfully lonely experience.

&#x200B;

Two days passed, with still a glimmer of hope I looked up my friend's name. Suprisingly I found him online, posting photos, in Queensland, Australia? Day 25 of moving? Right on the day of HIS funeral. I spoke to him less than a week before I got the letter and there was no talk of moving at all, in fact not even his backdrop during our videocall changed from his usual office room. If my predicament didn't seem like the result of a creative brain during deep sleep than I can assure you it gets worse. One thing I found was a day old local article, another obituary, with my name and once again no photo where it should be, the second thing I found was my friend's newest post, having a beer with me, 10 minutes ago. So there I was apparently, a recently passed away person, while also partying in Australia, but in actuality standing in my living room, crapping myself from fear.

&#x200B;

Today it escalated further, the envelope the invitation was in vanished, but I took out the invitation itself and stashed it in my drawer so I quickly checked it, it's still there. At first it seemed normal, well as normal as something like this can be, except for the spine chilling detail that I read my own name on it. The date for the funeral? The exact date when I found my obituary. This all happened soon after I attended. Out of any invitation I cancelled on in my life this should have been it.

&#x200B;

I don't know what the solution is, I don't know how this is happening or why. My neighbours still talk to me so it's obvious I'm not a ghost or undead. After I post this, I'm going to start planning for leaving city life behind and moving, I need peace and I'm looking forward to getting it.
