"Dude, check this out!"

Tim held the magazine up to my face like he just found the Holy Grail. I snatched it out of his hands and studied the front cover. 

*Catgirls: Off the Leash!* was written in sultry red font at the top of the page. Below it was some anime chick with cat ears holding a Glock pointed right at the reader.

"Tim, we've talked about this. I don't wanna see your weird nudie mags, and I certainly don't wanna see any cat-on-cat action."

Tim grinned as he took back the magazine.

"C'mon, Anna. There's no actual cats in it. Just babes. Trust me, it's really hot."

  
He flipped to another page near the middle. He moved his grimy finger across it, clearly looking for something to win me over. I turned away from him, trying my best to ignore his awkward attempt at camaraderie. Suddenly, he gasped, shoving the page in my face like a madman.

"Look at her! Isn't she just the cutest? Her eyes sorta look like yours!"

"That looks like a child."

"Actually, she's over one million years old."

"Sure."

"Her name is Natsuki; she comes from the planet..."

"Tim, seriously. I don't care. Take your anime porn somewhere else."

Brushing his greasy blond hair aside and adjusting his fingerless gloves, he got up from the bench and waddled over to the cafeteria. Thank god. If you couldn't tell already, I was never very good friends with Tim Chambers. That's a shame, too, because we shared quite a bit in common. We were both nerdy, me more on the artistic side and him on the, for lack of a better word, "neckbeard" side. My best friend Ellie had unexpectedly moved away a few days before senior year started, and we were pretty much the only people who could stand each other. We still kept in contact by texting, but it wasn't nearly the same. Tim was more of a passive presence in my life. He would sit at the next table over from us at lunch and didn't seem to have many people to sit with him. Ellie and I did invite him to join us one time, and we found out quickly that he wasn't the soft-spoken, intelligent kind of nerd but the rub-it-in-your-face, know-it-all kind of nerd. A dork, if you will. His main topic of interest was always, always girls. What they were wearing, how we would rate them out of 10, who the hottest young actress was at any given moment, etcetera. Also, he stunk. Bad. Like rotten watermelons. You know when you leave fruit out for too long and it gets all spicy and sour? He smelled how that tastes.

Fortunately, I've never had to deal with Tim for too long at a time. Usually he just gets bored and harasses someone else, although I noticed that he liked to target me specifically during senior year. I guess he thought he could fill the vacant spot in my two-person friend group by showing off his "interests," seeing as he didn't have any friends himself. Truth be told, it made me feel a little bad for him now that I was in his spot. That's why I made the worst decision of my life. I decided to hang out with him for a day. 

I was by my locker and ready to head home from school when Tim waddled up to me, his belly hanging out of his ill-fitting Sonic shirt. 

"Hey, uh, Anna?" 

"Tim, I swear to god if it's more-"

"No, no, no. It's not. Promise. I forgot to bring *Catgirls* with me anyway."

"What a shame."

"Yeah, I know. Anyways, my mom's out for the night. She got another DUI and has to stay in jail until tomorrow morning. Fuckin' pigs."

"Oh. Well, I'm really sorry about that, Tim."

"I was thinking that maybe we could hang out tonight. Y'know, just you and me. I've got the new Tekken; you like Tekken, right?"

I did like Tekken, although I wasn't sure how he knew that. I was about to reply when Tim interrupted.

"Oh, I can buy dinner, too. Anyplace you want. McDonald's, KFC, Arby's..."

"That's really nice of you, but I'm going to be a little busy with homework tonight."

"But the year just started! It's only the first week; how much homework could you possibly be getting?"

Shit. He got me there. Tim was practically begging on his knees by this point.

"Please? I promise it'll only be a few hours. Everyone else was busy, so you're the last friend I haven't asked."

I sighed, staring blankly into the vent of my locker. 

"Fine. But only for a few hours."

Tim pumped his fist in the air, rushing over to his locker. When he opened it, I saw that its interior was completely covered in old Playboy and anime pinups. He took his backpack out and hung it over his shoulder, grinning from ear to ear.

"Alright, my house is at 1028 XXXX Avenue. Come around 6:00 to 6:30. See you then!"

With that, he walked towards the exit door, but not before stopping behind me.

"Y'know, Anna, you have really beautiful eyes."

Giggling like a madman, he ran past the lockers and out the front exit.

Jesus. What did I get myself into?

Waiting for 6:00 was like watching a time bomb tick down. I knew there was no going back on my promise, that was for sure. I texted Ellie in anticipation, just to share my pain with someone else.

"Yikes. Praying 4 u girlie," she answered.

Yikes indeed.

I checked my watch. 5:45. Shit, shit, shit. I should probably start the car. As I hesitantly hopped in my ride, thoughts of cowardice raced through my head. I could say I was sick, or that there was a family emergency, or... Nah. He'd never believe me. 

The inky September roads treated me well at first but gradually deteriorated into strips of potholes and rough cracks. I rarely drove to this part of town, especially not alone, and to see it this late was a tad unnerving. The derelict houses lined the block like warped dominoes, each ready to topple on top of each other. 1028. 1028. I saw a 1023 back that way. Shit. Fortunately, I found the address. Unfortunately, it was attached to a house. A house that I had to stay in for hours lest I betray the only person who reached out to hang with me. Maybe I was the asshole all along.

The Chambers household was only a few steps above a meth lab. The house itself looked worn; wood panels specked with grime and moss. There was a large shed in the backyard in a condition no better than the house. I warily walked up the decaying front steps and knocked on the front door (no doorbell, of course). Within seconds, I heard heavy footsteps from inside the house, accompanied by a deep, raspy bark. The door opened, and there stood Tim, Mountain Dew in hand.

"Dude, you made it!"

"Yep. So where do I put my coat and stuff?"

"Uh, just put it in my room. Don't leave it near the door; Rex might piss on it. He's not house trained yet."

As he said that, he pointed toward an emaciated pitbull sitting in the corner. Beside him was a dog bowl filled with disgusting red muck, which I assumed was his "food.".

"We used to have a cat, too. Rex isn't so good with cats," Tim chuckled to himself as he beckoned me upstairs. Following him, I grabbed the handrail, only to realize it was wet with grease.

"We don't get to clean often. You'll get used to it," said Tim as he trudged over to his bedroom. I wiped the stain on my pantleg and went in after him. Reaching the doorway, I stood in shock. I had made a huge mistake.

Tim's room was covered floor to ceiling in pinups. Vintage Playboys, manga, and even some Instagram pictures of girls from our school were printed out and taped to the walls.

"Welcome. Hope it's not too hot in here, if you know what I mean," Tim laughed, wiping some Cheeto dust off his jacket.

I stepped forward an inch, only to feel something squishy beneath my feet. A body pillow. Of course.

"Trust me, Anna, there's stuff in this room you can't find anywhere else," he said, bringing out a box of VHS tapes from his closet. He dug around and pulled out a tape with some anime girl on it.

"Now this one, this one is good. Lotta great action from every angle, I think."

"Tim, we've talked about this. Repeatedly. I'm not interested." He pouted a bit and dropped the tape back into the box.

"Sure, sure. My mistake. Wanna play Tekken?"

Before I had the chance to mutter some bullshit excuse on why I had to leave, he pulled me by the arm and sat me down in front of the TV. It was a tiny thing, not much bigger than one from the 80s or 90s.

"Sorry about the crappy TV. The other one is being used right now."

I just nodded, waiting for the clock to let me escape this hell. He turned the console on and handed me a controller, taking a seat entirely too close to me. We picked our characters (me choosing one of the girls) and started the match. Tim, unsurprisingly, yammered on throughout the whole game.

"Pretty elaborate decorations, I know. Hey, a guy has his interests!"

"Sure."

"Thanks, but you know what pisses me off? Females don't appreciate this stuff like guys do. Seriously. Why can they cover their rooms in shitty boy band posters and celebrities, but guys can't do the same? It's bullshit."

"Yeah."

"I mean, it's not for lack of trying. I've been available for years," he sighed.

He was spin-kicking me into oblivion by this point in the game, winning the first round easily.

"It's not like I'm missing out on much anyway. Most chicks nowadays are like fish, y'know? Cut off the head, keep the body." Tim snickered at his own joke.

"Okay."

The next match started. He kept wailing on my character, locking her into a chain of pain. He continued.

"They're inconsiderate, plain and simple. They wouldn't know a gentleman if it hit 'em in the face."

"Cool."

"Hey, are you listening?" he said as he turned towards me.

"Um, yeah. I agree, with, like, everything you said."

"Good. Y'know, people in the West just don't take care of themselves anymore. It's sad." He said, Cheeto-spit dribbling from his lips.

"I can't imagine why you're not more popular," I muttered. 

"I know! Crazy world. People wonder why we're so addicted to technology. It's because real females aren't appealing anymore. They've started loving themselves more than their man. Bad, bad deal."

I rolled my eyes a little at this. Big mistake. Tim paused the game mid-match, glaring at me with beady eyes. He opened his mouth, rancid breath wafting up my nostrils.

"I feel like you're not taking this seriously. I'm pouring my heart out to you, and you can't even be bothered to pay attention. Whatever. I'm sure you'll be reporting back to Chad's house in due time."

"Who the fuck is Chad?"

"He's not a person. He's an idea. A symbol for all the assholes that-"

Barely containing my laughter, I set down my controller and yawned.

"It's been great, Tim, really, but I have to go," I said, getting up off the floor. Tim put a tubby hand out in front of him, signaling me to stop.

"Wait. I have one more thing to show you. I think you're gonna like it."

"I'm sure I would, but I really have to-"

"It's about Ellie."

I stopped in my tracks. 

"Ellie?"

"Yep. She gave me something she wanted me to show you."

"Where? Where is it?"

"Over in the shed. It's huge."

On one hand, I wanted to see whatever she had given him. On the other hand, there was no way I was going to his creepy shed alone.

"Well, maybe you can just give it to me at school tomorrow," I said.

As I headed for the doorway, I felt a heavy object collide with the side of my head. Holding the wall for support, it came down on me again, bringing me to the floor. My vision grew darker and darker. The decision had been made for me.

I opened my eyes and was met with blackness. The only thing I knew for certain was that I was tied to a chair. I felt my arms and legs chafing against thin rope, with my hands resting in fuzzy handcuffs on my lap. A piece of tape covered my mouth, stifling any potential vocalizations for help. I felt tiny, prickly feet scaling my legs. Looking down, I saw what they belonged to. Silverfish. The room was absolutely infested with them, the dampness of the floor and walls providing a haven for the little pissants. Glancing around, I was able to register that this was some kind of basement or bunker underneath the shed, judging by the wooden ceiling above me. Next to me was a table with various tools, positioned underneath a large sawblade jutting out from the wall. I turned my attention to the other side of the room. There seemed to be a person sitting on a chair in the corner, although I could only see their silhouette. Somebody else was behind me, standing still against the back wall. Suddenly, a familiar voice echoed from the room in front of me.

"Sorry for making you wait so long; I was just getting ready. Gotta look presentable, y'know?" It was unmistakably Tim. His face peeked out from the corner of the room, his cracked and rotted teeth forming a wide smile. Waddling up to me, he put his hands on my shoulders and gave a throaty laugh.

"Hope you didn't get conked too hard. I just need your opinion on something, if that's okay. See, I'm having trouble deciding what she should wear," he said, pointing to the person sitting in the corner.

"I've been thinking something gothic, like a corset or a funeral dress. Ah, you know what? I'll let you see for yourself."

He walked over to the nearest light switch, flipping it on. Once my eyes adjusted to the brightness, I could clearly see the person in the chair.

Or what was left of her.

When you meet a new person, the first thing you notice are their eyes. It's how we make nonverbal connections, how we "read" another person past a simple hello. What I was met with was a dim reflection of my own face. The woman in the chair had no head; in its place was an old television combo unit with a slot at the bottom for a tape. The body connected to it was that of an older woman wearing a plain white gown that went down to her ankles. Wires and cables ran up and down her person like thin tendrils, entangling her in a circuit that ended in the soulless screen I saw before me. Iron supports held the unit in place so that she didn't topple over from the sheer weight of the device.

"I was thinking to myself, "The body's fine, but the face could use a little work. "I'm sure she would agree," Tim laughed. He walked back over to the room he came out of, returning with his box of VHS tapes and a TV remote.

"Check this out."

He pulled a random tape out of the box and placed it in the VCR slot. The screen flickered to life, fuzzy at first, but soon focused. It showed a picture, probably taken from one of Tim's videos or magazines, of a beautiful woman with vibrant red hair. You could only see her from the neck up and was directly facing the camera, almost like a mugshot.

"Cool, isn't it? I'm a big redhead guy myself, but discriminate I do not." Smiling, Tim pressed a button on his remote, changing the image to an attractive blonde shot in a similar way. Glancing to me as if seeking approval, he pressed the button again. And again. And again and again and again. Brunettes, redheads, blondes, younger, older—I even recognized some celebrities in the mix. Eventually, he landed on a goth-looking girl with heavy makeup.

"Talk about a boob tube, right? Anyway, I was thinking about something like this. Paired with some Hot Topic clothes, I think it would look really good. Nod yes if you like it, no if you don't."

I wasn't about to partake in Tim's little face-swapping experiment, so I stayed completely still. Growing impatient, he turned off the TV and bent down to meet my eyes.

"I should have known you wouldn't cooperate. Guess I'll have to figure it out myself, then. Regardless, that's not why I brought you down here."

He turned my chair around, putting his plump, greasy hands over my eyes.

"Alright, I'll count to three. Ready? One, two," he removed his digits from my face, one by one.

"Three!"

I didn't register what was in front of me at first. It looked like some shapeless blob of flesh, but upon closer inspection, it had a vague resemblance to a human body. Arms, legs, and a torso were present, but they all seemed stiff and artificial. It seemed like a doll or pillow of some sort, only instead of silk or cotton, a thick layer of human skin clung to its form. The stitching was poorly done, with flaps of raw flesh hanging off the body like leaves on a rose. The hair was attached to the scalp in brown clumps that were rapidly falling off. Atop its head were a pair of real cat's ears, black in color. They appeared to be sewn on haphazardly, with one ear slightly askew. Its mouth was permanently in an "O" shape, with its lack of teeth accentuating its strange look. But the most uncanny part of all were the eyes, or the lack of them. Two gaping holes filled the upper part of its face, starkly contrasting the light skin. Tim put his hands on the thing's shoulders, speaking again.

"Say hello to Ellie. I know it's been a while."

I would have vomited, but the duct tape wouldn't let me. 

"I knew you'd love it. She was always such a beautiful girl. Although you might be wondering why she's incomplete." Tim shrugged and let out a chuckle.

"Truth be told, nothing above the neck impressed me. Butterface city, am I right? I figured I could do some experimenting, swapping different assets and such. Then I saw your eyes."

"Your eyes are orbs of perfection, my lady. And since you two were so compatible personality-wise, I figured you might be physically compatible, too."

I had to hold back tears. I couldn't show any weakness in front of this monster.

"Don't cry, Anna. What you're experiencing is beauty in its purest form," he crooned. He pulled out a rusty-looking scalpel from his pocket and tapped it on the back of the chair. A smirk graced his pimpled face.

"But first, time to say goodbye."

Tim walked over to the corpse doll and grabbed her by the back of the head. He shoved the doll's face in mine, directing its lips to my cheeks. The sick odor of death permeated my nostrils as he tried to mime the doll "kissing" me.

"Aw, look! She loves you!" squealed Tim as I felt Ellie's lipstick stain my face. There was only one way I could get out of this. In between the assaults,  I rammed my head into his as hard as I could. He staggered back in pain, dropping both Ellie and his scalpel, the tool falling directly on my lap. Tim was covering his head with his hands, combing his digits through his oily hair. I grabbed the scalpel with what little dexterity my bound hands had left and tried my best to cut through the rope binding my arms. Unfortunately, my grip wasn't tight enough to leave a mark. He was getting steady now, ready to lunge towards me in rage. He charged forward, tackling me and splintering the chair with his immense weight. Pointing the scalpel towards him, I made a weak stabbing motion, hoping to hit any part of him. The blade jammed into his exposed underbelly, leaving a crimson gash across his lower stomach. He roared in pain, gripping the wound with both hands to stop the bleeding. I slashed again, hitting his right arm this time. He toppled over on his side, rolling around in agony. I tried to cut the other ropes in the meantime, working the bloodied scalpel across my restraints as well as I could. With a few of the arm bands chopped, I could more easily reach my leg restraints. I looked over to Tim, still writhing in his own juices. He kept trying to get up, but every attempt ended with him crashing to the ground. I severed the rest of my bonds, allowing me to finally stand up. Still wearing the handcuffs, I ran over to the saw blade and cracked the chain over it. Luckily for me, these were cheapo "play" cuffs, so they snapped easily.

Tim, now sallow and frail, had also gotten to his feet. He shuffled towards me, a manic grin filling his tubby face. Suddenly, he let out a wet, plehgmy cough, and his breathing started to become rattly and uneven. He still kept walking. I picked up the back piece of the broken chair, hoping to end things as humanely as possible. Holding the plank over my head, I prepared to land the finishing blow. Tim's eyes were wide as saucers, and for a brief moment I saw some humanity in them. He had the pleading look of a toddler who just stole a cookie from the cookie jar—the look of an eternal child that had not yet been warped by vice and envy. I saw his story written on his face and lodged within his wounds. But only for a moment.

The board crashed down on his head, sending him face-first into the concrete. He lay there like a beached whale, breathing shakily before stopping altogether. I turned to the room he originally came out of, looking for any possible exit. Sure enough, there was a wooden door in the back of the room. Walking towards it, I noticed two phones sitting side by side on a table next to the door, one blue and one pink. The blue one was mine, and I recognized the other as Ellie's. I took both, checking mine first. It seemed to have been untouched by Tim. Ellie's, on the other hand, had clearly been in his possession for a while. He had changed the background to that disgusting skin doll, I guess, as some sort of sick joke. The messaging app was filled to the brim with worried texts from her family members wondering where she and her parents were over the last few days. Tim must have been responding to these as "Ellie" to try and assuage their fears. Grimacing, I took both devices and exited through the door. Upon heading through, I was met with stairs leading up to a hatch affixed to the shed's floor. From there, escaping the makeshift dungeon was simple. The only thing left to do was get help.

The police came within minutes of calling. I directed them to the shed, making sure to show them where the entrance to the underground area was. The TV woman was identified as Ellie's mother, most likely killed at the same time she was. The body of her father was not found in its entirety, but traces of human flesh were found in the various dog food bowls throughout the house. The family was, in truth, not planning to move. I guess Tim himself started that rumor to cover his tracks. Tim's mom, as expected, claimed to know none of this was going on, saying that she only really went outside to get groceries or go to the bar (which is where she spent most of her time). The hatch was for a storage area that she thought they'd never use, so she paid it no mind. Tim himself was pronounced dead from blood loss and was hastily removed from the scene. I assume his destination will be an unmarked grave, but who knows?

As for me, I'm fine. I've been living life as best I can, trying to remember all the good times I had with Ellie. Every so often, I get an old yearbook out and flip through it for nostalgia's sake. Seeing those ancient pictures of me from first grade is quite a trip. I noticed something in last year's book, though. I went to the back page with all the signatures from my year, and out of the corner of my eye I glanced a name written in red ink.

Tim Chambers.

Written above the name was a brief message:

"Anna, thanks for being a great friend."
