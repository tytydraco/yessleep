Where I come from, the fields stretch far and wide, endless rows of plowed earth and wheat swaying under the moonlight. During the day, they feel safe, comforting even. But at night? At night, they’re different. And everyone knows: Don’t walk the fields at night.

I used to think it was just a superstition, something parents told their kids to keep them close to home after dark. But then I broke the rule. And now, I’ll never doubt it again.

It started when I was seventeen, after a late-night argument with my dad. I slammed the door behind me and stormed off, too angry to care about curfews or warnings. The town was six miles away, and I figured the walk through the fields would help me cool off. The night was quiet, the only sounds the crunch of my boots on dirt and the soft rustle of the wind through the crops. For a while, it was almost peaceful.

But then I saw it.

At first, it was just a shape in the distance, moving across the plowed rows. It was hard to tell what it was—a deer, maybe? But as I walked, I realized it wasn’t an animal. It was a figure. Human-shaped, but wrong. Its movements were jerky, unnatural, like it didn’t understand how to walk properly. It stayed in the field, parallel to me, never coming closer but always keeping pace.

I tried to tell myself it was nothing, just some trick of the light, but I quickened my steps all the same. My heart pounded in my chest as I reached the old bridge that crossed a narrow creek. Half a mile of woods lay beyond it, and then I’d be at the neighbor’s house, safe in the glow of their porch lights.

That’s when I heard it:
“Help me...”

It was faint, like a whisper carried on the wind. I froze, gripping the straps of my backpack.
“Help me... please...”

The voice was coming from under the bridge.

Every rational part of me screamed to keep walking, but something held me there. What if someone was really down there? Hurt? Lost?

I took a cautious step toward the edge, peering into the darkness below.
“Help me...”

The voice was closer now, but something was off about it. It sounded hollow, mechanical, like someone imitating a cry for help. My stomach twisted.

Then I saw it.

A pair of eyes, glowing faintly in the dark, stared back at me. The figure from the field stood beneath the bridge, its head tilted at an unnatural angle. It didn’t move. It just stared.

And then it spoke again, but this time, it used my voice.
“Help me... please...”

I ran. I didn’t look back, didn’t stop until I reached the neighbor’s house. Their porch light was on, and Mr. Harris was standing outside, smoking a cigarette. He watched me stumble up the driveway, gasping for breath.

“You saw it, didn’t you?” he said quietly, his face pale. “The thing in the fields.”

I couldn’t speak, could only nod.

He shook his head. “It calls out, tries to lure you in. Don’t ever stop. Don’t ever look. And whatever you do, don’t walk the fields at night.”

The next morning, curiosity got the better of me. I went back to the bridge. Beneath it, the dirt was disturbed, footprints circling endlessly in the sand. In the center was a shredded rabbit, its remains scattered like some grotesque ritual.

I never walked the fields at night again. But sometimes, when I’m lying in bed, I still hear it. A voice outside my window, soft and pleading.
“Help me... please...”

I don’t answer. Because I know if I do, it won’t be me who comes back.
