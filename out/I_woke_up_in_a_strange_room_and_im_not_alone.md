Darkness, that's all I saw. Well, that was until they turned the lights on. I could hear a eerie buzzing noise faintly in the background, it reminded me of a power generator maybe? i didn't know exactly but it creeped the hell out of me. Well, then the realization of my surroundings hit me. I was in a room, white walls. looked sort of like the ones you see on television, you know what i mean? The ones in psychiatric hospitals or whatever the hell they were called. The lights above me flickered dimly, I looked down at myself. I was wearing some sort of hospital gown.

"Weird. Where the fuck am I?" i thought to myself as i scanned the surroundings.

The first thing I saw, A worn leather chair with a loose cushion seated in front of a television. It was an old one. Not like the ones we see nowadays, those old pieces of junk, the ones with 2 antennas popping out at the top, I had never even seen those in real life, only in old shows i used to watch as a kid.

"A camera?"* I noticed it from the corner of my eye, close to the ceiling on the corner of the room.

"I guess someone wants to watch..", I chuckled and walked towards the television set, taking a seat on the chair.

Suddenly, I heard footsteps...it was unsettling to say the least, they weren't coming from a single direction, it was from everywhere. All around me, felt like it was circling me. There was nothing in the room except me, or maybe there was. I wasn't sure.
I frantically looked around, searching for the source of those footsteps... They kept on becoming louder, I kept trying to listen until I felt it. Something warm, breathing down my neck. I tried to move but i couldn't...

"No No No No-t-This can't fucking e-end like this. Fuck-Fuck-Fuck No..", my thoughts went berserk, I couldn't move. My body wouldn't let me. I sat there, eyes wide open with whatever the fuck was behind me standing behind, breathing down my neck as if it was waiting.

This continued for an entire minute, a minute which felt like I was burning alive. My mind screaming at me to run away but my body wouldn't listen. Then, i heard the sounds of footsteps receding.

"Is it over? fuck.. is it leaving? Please god... Please tell me it's gone.", I begged in my thoughts, meanwhile the footsteps became quieter... disappearing into the bright walls of the room.

As soon as the footsteps disappeared entirely, everything felt as if it was back to normal. I immediately got out of the chair and fell down on my knees, trying to breathe. Oh, I looked so much like a fucking idiot back then.

"Fuck- I- i survived...i thought I was going to die", I looked at the camera at the ceiling in the corner of the room in a mix of emotions. Happiness, but as well as fear, anxiety and everything in between.

As I said that, I fell down on the ground... My entire body giving in. It was too tired, especially after whatever the hell just happened. 

"I swear to fucking god, if this is because of those meds that bastard prescribed me..", i muttered as i panted for air.

I laid there, for some time. I don't know how long, a minute? 10 minutes? an hour? an entire day? I don't know. A lot of everything that happened feels hazy now. but at one point, i managed to stand up again. And after debating with myself, trying to muster up the courage to sit on that chair again, fearing it will come again. I finally sat down on it, U noticed that in between the cushions of the chair, there was something stuck...I  put my hand in there, pulling that strange object out.

"The hell? This is just a normal TV remote..." I looked at the old television  "I don't think these old junks even had remotes back then?", i muttered under my breath.
There were the usual buttons. The ones to switch channels, turn it off or on, volume. All that jazz.

"I guess it wouldn't hurt to try using this..", I thought to myself, turning the TV on using the remote in my hand, and surprisingly it worked..

Except for the fact it was all blank static, just those pretty little boxes. you know, those ones which went "shhhhh".

"This shit...", I muttered under my breath.

The static hiss of the TV combined with the soft buzzing of something in the background, outside the room. It was fucking killing me.

"Am i going to just die here?", I thought to myself, staring off into the Television screen until finally snapping out of it when suddenly...

There was a hiss sound from behind me, like something opening? I looked back to see a part of the white wall opening...some type of gas coming out, I felt a cold breeze hit me and a nice scent, of perfume? A Woman who looked to be in her mid 20s, wearing a lab coat entered the room through the door.
I got up from the chair and faced her.

"I- Who the hell are you?", i shouted at her from afar, terrified by her sudden appearance.

"Subject 369...You're finally awake", She said as she observed me, sounding monotone, and to be honest, unnervingly creepy.

"I-subject? Whe-Where the hell am i?", I asked her, barely managing to speak competently.

"That's not your concern. Tell me, anything weird happened to you in the past few hours?", She questioned me as she took a step closer.

"I-don't come closer- don't-not again.. this must be a fucking joke..is it with fucking with me again?", i muttered to myself.

She overheard me and replied as she stepped closer.

"What is? What's fucking with you again?", she sounded genuinely curious with a hint of surprise, even though she didn't let it show in her voice.

"I don't fucking know, it came to me a bit after i woke up. I-i sat in that chair and it was there, standing behind me.. breathing onto my neck- fuck i feel it. I feel like it's there. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Please save me, please. I don't want to die. It's going to kill me."  I dropped onto my knees in front of her, begging.

"Tch, another one.", She spoke with a hint of disappointment.

As she said this, she turned around and started walking back to the door. Stopping in between to turn back.

"Best of luck..", she said.

She then proceeded to turn back around, exiting through the door she came from and closing it behind herself.

"No-no-no- FUCK NO! YOU CANT LEAVE ME HERE ALONE. NO", I screamed at her as the door closed. The realisation hit me. I was trapped here, with something that wanted to probably skin me alive; 

I laughed, scratching my face with my nails, they had grownâ€”a lot. I don't know how long I'd been there but do hope I get out of here, soon. Alive, that is.
