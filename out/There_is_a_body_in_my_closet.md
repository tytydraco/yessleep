As I type this I am dealing with a problem that hopefully no other person will ever have to contend with.

To make things brief: there is a body in my closet. It’s a male body, it has no clothes, no hair on its skin from what I can see, and the face appears to be embalmed in a way that gives it the appearance of a mannequin with its eyes sewn shut.

I don’t know how it ended up in there. A few days ago, as I was getting ready for work, I opened my closet door and found it laying on the floor, curled up with its arms wrapped around its legs.

It doesn’t smell, and it hasn’t deteriorated any further from the original state that I’d discovered it in. 

Now, As you could imagine, I have reached a juncture. I live with a roommate and we both attend the same collage. I intended to tell him about the body when I first discovered it, but I got cold feet because I realized this would probably end with him calling the cops on me and my life being ruined. 

So I didn’t tell him, and at this point I don’t know how I could tell him without the lapse of time incriminating me even further. 

I thought about dragging it out in the middle of the night and dumping in an alleyway or a dumpster, but that seemed like a risky thing to do, especially with all the parties that the neighbors seem to be throwing late into the night these days.  

It’s still in my closet and I had simply chosen to live with it for the time being. It was only supposed to be for a while. Only until I had had all my bases covered and all of my ts crossed about it.  

I knew I’d have to deal with it eventually, but just not right now. No. Not right now. Not when I have so much going for me:

-I just got hired for the internship I’d been aiming for at the law firm of my dreams

-I finally got the courage to ask out the cute barista at the local Starbucks and  we’re on our third date, 

-my savings have never been better, etc.

I only wanted to have some peace before the inevitable storm on the horizon. 

Or so that was the idea.

Last night, as I was studying for an exam that was scheduled in the morning - I heard a creak. It was quick and intentional, like the chirp of a bird. 

But I could tell immediately that It was the unmistakable peep of a rusty door being pushed open. 

My first thought was that I’d somehow forgotten to lock my bedroom door and my roommate had mistakenly walked in on me, but as I panned across the room I realized that, amongst the web of shadows that coated my walls, I could see the shimmering reflection of my white lamp etched into my locked doorknob. 

I was stunned for a second, as the thought had crossed my head first before the impulse had reached my eyes. 

Slowly, and with the benign tumorous thought of impossibility, my vision suddenly locked eyes with the streak of void that held my closet doors apart like a wedge. 

“Was it the closet?” I thought in silence. 

I knew that, had it been some faulty screw on its frame or a misplaced shoe on the floor that had simply caused it to gradually open until it made a sound, I would’ve dismissed it. However, I also knew that no matter how hard I tried to lie to myself at that moment; I couldn’t reject the feeling that something was staring directly at me. 

And there was breathing. Soft and rhythmical breathing in the darkness. 

I could hear the heavy beat of drums inside of my ears, as I eventually panned down so that my traveling gaze finally reached its dead end at the floor. 

I couldn’t believe my eyes. 

In front of me rested a single grey, ignominious arm poking out from the darkness.

Its forearm remained as still as a dry earthworm in the moonlight and its fingers curled upwards like the dead arms of a spider. The yellow nails of each fingertip were splintered in a way that caused them to resemble the decay of a smoker’s rotten teeth. 

I stared at it for what must’ve been a minute at most. But it was a drunk and melancholic minute of time, and it would be forever incomparable to any other experience I had, or would have, ever experienced in my life. 

I tightly clutched my pen in one hand, with droplets of sweat around my eyes. I was shivering with fear, and for a glimpse, I could swear there was a boa constrictor wrapped around my heart and it was squeezing out all the blood. 

Though, before I could do anything, there was a knock at my door. 

“Hey Josh! Don’t forget! you’re on bathroom duty tomorrow!” The untimely voice of my roommate pierced from the other side like a shotgun.

“O-oh y-yeah. Sure.” I stammered as I heard a grunt in response and the sound of footsteps turning in the other direction before walking away. 

By the time I turned to look back, the closet door had already been shut closed.

I should’ve done something else, I realize now. But perhaps it was my innate aversion to conflict that forced me to bury my head in sand. 

I’m convinced now that that should’ve been my turning point, my breaking point, or whatever it’s called.

I should’ve told somebody, done something, other than procrastinate for even longer. 

But I once again decided that a lie would be preferable to the truth. 

But I was only coping, and I knew that I was only coping.

Now, it’s only a matter of time until this gets out. Because this evening, as I returned home from work, I swear, looking from the outside, I could see a person’s shadow standing in front of my bedroom window.
