The end isn't going to be loud. There will be no fanfare, no great send off. There will be no echo's of what was lost, what could have been. There will only be silence.

My name is Jacob and I am a Director of Deep Space Analytics and Exploration for NASA, for any inquisitive minds, though it won't matter for much longer. My job, for the past fifteen years, has been to over see data collection, collaborate with other departments, and prepare for deep space travel. To be honest, I love it. The unknown of space has been a great driving force for almost my entire life. I use to dream of being like Captain Kirk. Many kids do. Now all I have are nightmares.

Six years into my tenure, I was working on a project for black hole exploration. We had prepped and sent several satellite probes out, many of which would not reach their targets for years. That all changed when new propulsion technology broke, allowing fuel less acceleration. The tech had something to do with magnetism, and was extremely ground breaking. I quickly found myself embedded with a group of theoretical physicist who had the massive goal of send a man through one of there worm holes. Though concerned, I was immediately impressed with how far they had gotten.

While I had spent many years developing latent deep space tech that could be used to traverse a black hole, they had been granted access to all my work, and had actually improved upon it. Some would find this demoralizing, but at the time I was elated. They had even begun developing a pressure proof craft. This was truly world changing stuff.

It wasn't long before I was completely committed to the project. We spent months finding the right candidate, and once we had, another two years prepping them. The whole time we were sending unmanned flights, data collection clusters, and imagery devices forward. Some were already out, and set to anchor points, where data could continue to be transferred back to us. There were 87 of these, spread along the path of the journey, to act as They moved slower though, while we saved the faster tech for the actually manned mission. This process was long, and grueling with years of work. No preliminary imaging have been received yet, but we deduced that, by the time our man and his craft were nearing, we would begin to receive images and data real time.

The day finally came. With massive help from the some of our other facilities, we were prepared to launch from Florida. We sent him off, smooth and easy. Thankfully there were no issues. Even with our new tech, it was still goin to take time. He was headed to the closest one, which is roughly 1,600 light years away, but we had that cut down to three months travel. We chose this black hole because it is stable, which means it isn't drawing matter in currently. That's what we assumed at least.

Do you know how it feels to have your life's work drifting away from you? Only hope was keeping it alive. With so many unknowns, we gathered daily, observing, reading telemetry data, and waiting for the cameras to start broadcasting.

We were all there when it happened. Every single one of us saw it all happen. I still cant come to grips with it.

It was sudden. The cameras came to life at the same time that real data and imagery began to come in. The black hole was huge, as expected. The worst part was, it indeed had begun absorbing matter. Very quickly, our brave astronaut and his craft were pulled in. The feed was like nothing we had ever seen. He was, for lack of better terms, sucked in. Somehow, the feeds remained active, but coms channels went dead. For fifteen minutes, great burst of light exploded across the screen, and then, nothing. There was a short period of blackness before we began to see planets again.

He had actually traveled through the hole and came out the other side. The satellites were coming in behind him. They were also still active.

Right before the first ones reached his current location, massive objects began to fill the screens, coming into his line of sight. With one last bright light, his feeds all went dead. We weren't getting anything from his end. Baited breath led to hope as our unmanned probes began to slip into this new location. That is when it all fell apart.

There were massive crafts, which had slipped into view just in front of the manned craft, and they were converging on our man. Then we saw that they had come from another black hole, just beyond the furthest planet we could view. They began to spread around this system at alarming speeds. That wasn't all they were doing.

It was clear now that these other planets held life. Wherever this black hole had spit him out, it was teeming with intelligence. We watched in awe as other craft, albeit smaller, seemed to scramble from the surface of these planets. They made to charge the bigger ships. Weapons began firing. It took less than three minutes. The large ships banked, opened fire, and not just the defending ships, but the planets too, were just...gone.

The last transmissions we received were images of our mans craft being taken aboard. They then noticed our satellites and quickly did away with them.

That was last week.

Every day since, more of our "anchored" transmission centers are going dark. The rate is alarming. We calculate that, by this time tomorrow they will be here. It seems they figured out exactly where we are from the manned craft. We witnessed an advanced species, far beyond our intelligence, be cleared from existence in a matter of minutes. Their planets, their history, gone. We are next.

This message is for no one and everyone. I'm sorry for my role in this. If we hadn't sent our craft out, maybe they would have never found us. Maybe we could have had a greater chance at life, at space exploration, at anything. But we doomed everyone on Earth. All I can say is, enjoy your next few hours, for they are the last. I don't plan on being around when "they" finally arrive.
