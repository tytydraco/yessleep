okay so. i don’t really post on reddit, i mostly just lurk and read weird stories when i can’t sleep or whatever. but something happened and I guess i’ve seen people share similar storys like this on here before so maybe someone will know what i should do?

anyway. i’ve always had really vivid dreams. like full on movie dreams, colors, smells, stuff that actually feels like i’m awake. it’s been like this since i was a kid. and sometimes, really small things from my dreams will happen. nothing crazy. like one time when i was 12 i had a dream that my mom used buttermilk instead of regular milk in her coffee and spit it out all over the floor. next morning, she grabbed the wrong milk carton and yeah… just like I saw in my dream

it’s always just been little stuff. my friends joke i’m like a witch or some fortune teller or something lol. they say “have any dreams about my next hot date?” like it’s funny. and it is usually light stuff.

but lately the dreams have been getting like louder? i don’t know how to explain it. more there? they feel heavier, and things keep lining up. more than usual. like i’ll dream i get a weird text from someone, and then i do. or i’ll dream about a commercial i haven’t seen in years and then it pops up the next day on youtube. stupid stuff. still small, but too many in a row.

so a few years ago, i had this dream about the house a few doors down the street. in the dream, i saw this guy break in through the back door with gloves on and steal a bunch of stuff. it was super fast and weird, like watching security cam footage. a few weeks later, my neighbor actually got broken into. back door. they took some prescriptions she left out and electronics. she told my mom and i felt SICK. like what the hell am i supposed to do with that?

and now this is like what i need help with. last night, i had a dream that my best friend died. but like she was murdered.

it was awful. i don’t even want to write it all out but i saw her lying on the floor in her apartment. there was blood. her front door was open and her cat was crying. it was so vivid it woke me up and i couldn’t breathe. it felt real. it still feels real. like it happened already and i just watched it from the wrong timeline or something.

i called her today. she’s totally fine. she laughed at me when i said I had a bad dream but like i didn’t tell her what it was about. how am i supposed to say that?? “hey haha i dreamed you got murdered, maybe lock your doors tonight”? 

but i can’t stop thinking about it. it won’t leave my head. i keep seeing the details, like how her plant by the window was knocked over, and there was this weird song playing on her phone, something she never listens to. and she was wearing her favorite hoodie. the blue one with the stains on the sleeve.

what do i do, should i tell her? I really dont want to freak her out, stuff like this she hateeesss so what if i make it worse? i know logically it is like probably nothing but I havent been able to sleep, im so scared to wake up to a call knowing I didnt do anything.
