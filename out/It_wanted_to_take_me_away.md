I'm homeless and living out of my car, but not for the reasons you'd think. You see, I'm what you would call a stereotypical mama's boy. Never had any girlfriends, not many friends either. I was an only child who spent all my time clinging to my mother. I didn't have a dad, but my mom made up for it. When she wasn't working she spent all of her time with me. Taking me to the movies, playing video games together. She was my entire world, the only person I needed. Unfortunately for me, this peace would all come crashing down. In my early twenties, my mom started getting sick.

I tried so hard to take care of her and prayed every single day. But things only got worse and the cancer would quickly take her life. Now without hope and all alone, I spiraled into a deep depression. House notes, bills, it all rested on my shoulders now. It was safe to say that I was a deer in the headlights. I had no social skills and no relatives who were willing to help. Before I knew it, I was living in a house with no lights or running water. I was in the worst situation of my life and ended up in a dark place. To keep from falling into drugs or something even worse, I had to leave.

One day, I packed up my car and didn't look back. I drove for what seemed like forever, seeing more of the world than I ever had before. I met all sorts of people during my travels, some freaks but others pretty cool. Literally everything was a new experience for someone who had been sheltered all of his life. But oddly enough, I didn't feel afraid at all. I did miss my dear mother; but there was a feeling of freedom with this new life. Until one day, something happened that forced me to consider finding a more traditional home. The story I'm about to share is one that most probably won't believe. But I know what happened and it will stick with me for the rest of my days.

It all started around midnight on a lonely country road. There was nothing but cow fields and old barns as far as the eye could see. I was trying to make it to the next town before calling it a night. 

But I had been driving all day and was getting pretty tired. Seeing as how I didn't wanna wreck my only home, I decided it was time to pull over. I parked on the outskirts of one of the large cow fields. It was a clear night with stars filling the sky. So I figured it would be nice to break out my tarp and enjoy the view. After setting up, I sat down and opened up a bag of chips. In moments like this, I always found myself thinking of my mother. I missed the times we shared together, which is why I had to leave. 

I didn't really know what life had in store, but there was no going back. I couldn't stomach having to live alone in that empty house. Over time, my eyes started to get heavy. I turned on my side ready to get some shut eye. Hoping an angry farmer wouldn't greet me with a shotgun the next morning. As I did, the most peculiar thing happened. What seemed like a ball of fire or some sort of meteor whizzed by. Thinking it was a shooting star, I paid it no mind. I would attempt to nod off, but that proved impossible. As the nearby woods gave off an ominous orange glow.

My first thought was that this could be a forest fire. But as I rose to my feet, a loud whirring sound filled the air. To the point that I started having strong headaches. I limped back to my car writhing in pain; prepared to call for help. While trying to dig for my phone, I heard a strange thud from behind me. Sort of like footsteps from a very large person. I turned to see whom or what was behind me, that's when I saw it. A giant creature about seven or eight feet tall in stature crept towards me. It seemed to be in some sort of metallic suit; giving off the same glow from before. The being wore an astronaut-like helmet that hid its facial features. It tried reaching for me with a slender and wrinkled arm.

I instantly screamed and locked myself inside my car. Tears started to swell as I feared for my life. Never before had I seen something so horrifying. It was obvious this being was not of our world. I grabbed a knife from my glove box and clutched it tightly. Not that it could stand up to a literal freaking monster. The next thing I knew, its bony three fingered hand was pressed against my window. I was certain that the being would have no trouble shattering the glass. Quickly I crawled onto the back floor board and started to pray.


I just lost my mother a few months ago and now a monster was trying to kill me. What did it want, and was my life seriously about to end here? All these things swirled through my mind, until I heard a voice.

One that came from within my own head, speaking in a very kind tone. "Do not fear human, for I've come to you with an offer. Come with us and learn...all there is. See sights that no other human could fathom. When you return, eternal knowledge will belong to you and you alone". I understood the words clearly; but my fear overpowered everything else.

Before giving the offer any thought, I yelled to the top of my lungs. “No, ju-just LEAVE me alone…go away!!!”. Following my outburst, everything went silent. Save for my nervous breathing I tried so desperately to hide. It seemed like an eternity had passed and I didn't hear anything. So reluctantly, I peered from the window to check my surroundings. I was relieved to see that this horrifying entity was no longer there. I glanced to my left then the right, it was really gone. Naturally I rushed into my front seat and started the engine. Before pulling off, I saw a large glowing object rise up from the trees.

It was cigar shaped and gave off the same loud humming sound from earlier. Even though I was terrified, I found myself transfixed by this once in a lifetime moment. Before I knew it, the craft shot up into the air faster than I could blink. Afterwards I peeled out of the field and kept driving until I found civilization. This was truly a harrowing experience for me, one that truly changed my outlook. Never had I believed in the supernatural or aliens; but my experience was all too real. I ended up keeping this story to myself for the longest. After all, a homeless guy who saw an alien probably wouldn't sound good. I ended up finding myself a job and an apartment. No longer interested in the nomadic lifestyle. Presently, I've even started dating a beautiful waitress. 

Even though my life is pretty normal, I still have strange moments. Every once in a while, whenever I'm alone. I feel as if I can still hear the creature calling out to me. Telling me that they're still watching and haven't forgotten me. But for the sake of normalcy, I try to ignore it. I often wonder what would have happened if I went with them. Was it a trap to hurt me, or would they have really shown me all these amazing things? I guess it doesn't matter now, but I'll never forget my close encounter on that dreary farmstead.
