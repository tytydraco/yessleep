My grandfather was a renowned child psychiatrist during those turbulent years of Franco's dictatorship. I barely knew him as a child, and my memories of him are scarce, bordering on confused. My grandfather died very old, nearly reaching triple digits. My mother admired him greatly, though she said he was a professional man, scrupulous in his work and very strict.

I'm ashamed to admit he gained much fame and prestige because he was aligned with the dictatorial regime, very close to its central power structure. But thanks to that, my grandfather published many studies and helped many people—especially during those early, bloody years when the human mind was still poorly understood. He was the first to apply the scientific method to his research on the child psyche.

My family is quite comfortable thanks to my grandfather's legacy, regardless of his dark past. Right after the war, hundreds of children were left traumatized by the loss of their parents—killed in combat, executed in purges, or exiled to another country. That's how my grandfather began his work, developing his methods amid overwhelming demand. My mother would occasionally mention that his breakthrough came after treating the child of some high-ranking official. Soon, the dictatorship took notice. He made a fortune. He bought many properties that are now extremely valuable, and this story begins with one of those houses he owned in central Madrid.

In the heart of Barrio del Pilar, my mother inherited several houses when my grandfather died. Little by little my family sold them off to increase our capital. Thanks to that financial comfort, I was able to study psychiatry like my grandfather until I graduated. As we sold the houses, we stored my grandfather's most interesting belongings in the largest one—the last place he lived before the regime fell and democracy arrived.

I rarely entered that house as a child or teenager, but when I was finishing my doctorate, I asked for the keys under the pretext of citing him in my papers. My mother, who worshipped her father, agreed proudly and happily. The house was full of tons of notes, jars containing body parts, wax sculptures formerly used in medicine, etc.

The sight commanded a certain respect. Between the musty smell of old paper and the medical artifacts, the house gave me chills—but I was practically a grown man. I wouldn't be intimidated by its macabre appearance. And yet... I ended up surrendering to the contents of those documents.

At first I was in my element, rummaging through papers, reading old case files and admiring my grandfather's wisdom. Despite his ties to the regime, he was a good man—he just wanted to help those poor children in those dark times. One day, I accidentally knocked over a huge stack of folders, hitting my head against a wall on the upper floor. Despite the intense pain, something about the impact didn't add up.

That wall was thin drywall. Once I recovered, I examined it—papered like the rest of the room with its tacky floral design—but I noticed it had no baseboard. The house was finished with exquisite wooden baseboards where the walls met the floor, likely made from now-extinct or endangered trees. Had the builders forgotten to finish this part? My analytical mind, trained in psychiatry, began searching for explanations: first, that there had been later renovations and they couldn't match the trim; second, that the wall had been added after construction. Leaning toward the second theory, I checked the floor. Sure enough, the aged parquet strips weren't cut flush to fit the puzzle—the wall had been built right over them.

Like a madman, fighting through old junk and piles of books, I analyzed the adjacent rooms. It felt like part of the house had been swallowed up. There was no door, no interior access whatsoever. A stroke of genius made me check the exterior. Since it was a standalone house, I circled it to examine what I assumed was the exterior wall. Bingo—in that area there was a window, but it was placed too high for easy access.

Retracing my steps, I searched for a hidden passageway but found nothing.

Being alone and relatively isolated, I decided to break through the next day—curiosity got the better of me. And so I did. The next day I came equipped with a sledgehammer, cold chisel, bucket and other tools. I felt important, like those home renovation show hosts so popular at the time, but as I broke through the drywall, I felt stupid. Very stupid. When I peered through the hole I'd made, I saw a folding ladder descending from the ceiling.

Idiot! I told myself—the access to that room was through the attic. Without dwelling on it too much, I climbed up to the attic through the main access and soon found the trapdoor leading down to the mysterious room. When I descended, I was awestruck.

It was a study, with a large antique desk sporting a 1970s intercom, and shelves crammed with countless recording formats—both audio and video. In one corner of the only bare wall stood a projection screen and several projectors. Even a small CRT television. On the desk sat an old tape player. Next to it were five large leather-bound filing cabinets, typical of the seventies.

Despite the dust and exhaustion, I began examining the filing cabinets, since they were the most organized things in the house. The first file summarized four child cases from different eras. According to my grandfather's notes, these were the only four cases he could never explain. Each case had its own cabinet.

With daylight still available, I wiped down the large leather chair—worn from all the years my grandfather had worked in it—and sat down. According to the first cabinet, these were records he could never publish, saved from censorship. They were meant to be his magnum opus, elevating him to Freud's level... But after several paragraphs of delusions of grandeur, my own grandfather had handwritten a note in the margin:

"This has surpassed all reason. Fear of public mockery and the ridicule of my work compels me to ensure these never see the light while I live. The scientific method has led me into penumbra where the light of science dares not shine... May God have mercy on whoever analyzes these documents. And please—do not think me mad."

Those words stoked the hungry flames of my curiosity even further. I decided then and there—the next day I would come early to study the files.

As I said, by about 9 AM I was already inside the room. I had many hours of daylight to read, and without hesitation, I opened the first cabinet—the thinnest one.

Date: March 16, 1940Subject: Tomás Izquierdo RobleAge: 8

BACKGROUND: The Holy Church came to my home urgently and at an ungodly hour, escorted by two unfriendly Gray Guard agents, so I didn't argue and agreed to see them. They'd been referred by friends of the child's parents, whose son I'd helped right after the war. To summarize, the father (whose name I cannot reveal for ethical and moral reasons) needed an urgent psychiatric evaluation. He wasn't pleased when I told him a complete assessment would take several days. Without further details, they said they'd bring the boy to the psychiatric hospital where I worked the next morning.

First contact: The child arrived gagged and strapped to a stretcher covered in green-tinged vomit and mucus, weeping and helpless. An elderly priest stayed with him at all times. It took tremendous effort to convince him that sessions needed to be private. The hospital director at the time trusted me and agreed to follow my methods despite the old priest's objections. After the nurses cleaned and dressed him, I went to see him in his room where he appeared to be resting.

Preliminary session transcript:

—Good afternoon Tomás, I'm your new doctor.

—Please," said the child through tears, "no more doctors or priests.

—Don't worry, I'm not that kind of doctor who'll inject you or insert tubes. I heal the mind.

—Please, go away.

—I'm sorry, but I can't," I said firmly. "I've been asked to evaluate you. The sooner we finish, the sooner you can leave. Tell me Tomás, do you know your parents' names?"

—Daniela and José.

—How old are you?

—Eight. I'll be nine in winter.

—You're very intelligent, Tomás.

The child stared at me blankly for several seconds from his bed.

—Don't doubt that, Serafín.

I froze—I hadn't told him my name.

—How do you know my name?"

—I heard the nurses say it. They think you're handsome.

I laughed, adjusting my glasses, and continued with my questions. Nothing seemed abnormal except the coldness in his responses. When I left, the crucifix above his bed suddenly detached and shattered loudly on the floor. As they cleaned it up, I could swear I saw the child smirking at the damage.

First session transcript: I had the boy brought to my office. When the nurses brought him in, he was more expressive than the day before. I sat him in the patient's chair across from my desk.

—Good morning Tomás. How are you today?"

—Good morning, doctor," the boy seemed frightened.

—It's alright Tomás, you can call me by my name. We met yesterday.

—It's just... I don't know your name.

I was surprised—yesterday he'd known instantly.

—It's Serafín. Don't you remember? You said you heard it from one of the nurses.

The boy's expression changed again.

—That's right, I forgot. Serafín. I heard it from Mercedes. You know what? She wants to corner you in the broom closet and suck your cock.

I turned pale. I hadn't expected that. While some traumatized children use foul language, his delivery was unnaturally adult. Following protocol, I responded:

—Please Tomás, be more polite.

His expression shifted back to fearful.

—Don't worry Tomás, I won't tell anyone. You can keep talking to me, but please don't be crude.

—I'm so sorry. Sometimes I don't know what I'm saying, doctor.

After an extensive conversation, I concluded the boy had an alter ego—a dissociation from reality. Foreign studies call it dual personality.

Second session transcript: Today I'll attempt to provoke this anomalous personality in Tomás. I notice sexual motivations—could someone have abused him at a young age? I've handled similar cases of abused children. Before the session, nurse Mercedes came in distressed—she refused to tend to Tomás again. After insisting she remain professional, she threatened to quit unless the boy was removed. Ignoring her, I had Tomás brought to my office. His blank stare was active.

—Good morning, Tomás.

—Good morning, Serafín. I see you've had trouble with Mercedes. I waited outside a long time with the other nurse. The poor thing is stupid, you know?"

More shocking than his vulgarity was his unnaturally fluent, adult speech pattern.

—Yes, she mentioned some inappropriate behavior we shouldn't discuss, especially in front of you.

Knowing his other personality was dominant, I pressed further. Studies show the alter ego retains traumatic memories.

—Inappropriate? What's more natural than wanting to fuck her like an animal?"

—Is that what someone did to you?"

—To me?... No, no one's ever touched me, though... The boy put his fingers to his chin as if remembering. "I think Rodrigo the orderly wants to wreck my ass in the showers. I can't wait for shower day.

—Tomás, I said no vulgarity. And that's not age-appropriate.

At that moment, I realized—many children had injuries after being tended by Rodrigo, who supervised baths among other duties. I later had him discreetly monitored until we caught him in the act and he was arrested. Continuing with Tomás:

—Then what should we talk about without vulgarity, Serafín?" asked the child.

—I want to know what trauma created this personality of yours.

—Very perceptive, doctor. You've figured me out.

—So you're aware of your condition?"

—I'm aware of everything. Nothing escapes my perception.

Something inside me—something unprofessional—stirred. Playing along, I tested him:

—Alright... What did I have for breakfast today?"

—Black coffee with sugar... How fortunate... Sugar in these times of scarcity.

—Does my breath smell that bad? Your deductive skills are impressive.

His voice grew guttural. His next words confirmed my fears:

—You vile, egotistical relic! How dare you suggest I deduced something so banal! I knew your question before you spoke!"

Anticipating his rage, I cut him off sharply:

—Silence, Tomás! Behave! If you knew my question, why get angry?"

Instantly, his face shifted back to fearful:

—Forgive me Doctor Serafín, —Tomás bleated like a newborn lamb—. Please don't tell the Father.

I ended the session there.

I took two days to draft the final report on the subject. The diagnosis was obvious—dissociative identity disorder. As I wrote the report, I worked late into the night in my office. I lit the desk lamps to finish up before heading home, but time got away from me. It was 2:15 in the morning when I gathered my papers and prepared to leave. The orderlies were keeping watch as usual. Not wanting to disturb the young patients' sleep, I removed my shoes to walk quietly through the long hallways toward the exit. Occasionally I peeked through the observation windows of the more troubled children to check on them.

Walking barefoot with my shoes in hand, I approached Tomás's room. As I drew nearer, I began to hear a monotonous murmur in a deep, guttural voice that reminded me of the subject's tone during our last session. Concerned he might be having an episode, I looked around for an orderly or nurse to accompany me, but my search was in vain. The two orderlies who should have been stationed at the hallway intersections were nowhere to be found.

Without the backup I'd hoped for, I peered through the observation window to assess the situation. What I saw remains a ghastly fixture in my darkest nightmares.

Tomás knelt naked at the foot of his bed, arms raised with his hands forming a trident shape at head level. His eyes had rolled back, and he continued murmuring what sounded like a prayer in that strained voice. Terrified, I threw open the doors and stepped barefoot into a pool of blood I hadn't been able to see through the window. My eyes followed the trail until they met the horrifying sight. One orderly stood naked, violently sodomizing the headless corpse of his fellow orderly. The severed head lay at the foot of Tomás's bed, and the walls were decorated with unknown symbols. The violating orderly himself bore markings that reminded me of African tribal war paint.

I stood paralyzed. Not even the war's torturers had described anything so grotesque. I don't know if it was a stress-induced hallucination or if it truly happened. But the head on the floor began speaking as smoke poured from its mouth and its eyes glowed. I heard words in another language, yet understood them perfectly.

"Serafín, now you shall bring me a child to complete the sacrifice..."

A scream behind me cut off the voice. It was the old priest who had brought Tomás to us, who at that moment shouted with cannon-like intensity, sending the priest flying down the hallway without touching him.

"Too soon... Not yet..." Tomás screamed with his white eyes rolling.

But the orderly, who hadn't stopped violating his colleague's corpse, appeared to be reaching climax, completely beside himself. He released the corpse and with an elbow smashed the window glass. Grabbing a shard, he knelt before the boy who kept screaming "NO! NOT NOW!"

The orderly clearly shouted "AVE METARRAÍM!" just before slitting his own throat.

Tomás flew into a rage, cursing everything imaginable. Objects in the room began flying violently in all directions, including me—I spun like a top, suspended midair without control.

This uncontrolled supernatural fury only subsided when the priest entered, confronting little Tomás with a cross and reading from a Holy Bible.

"WHAT IS YOUR NAME, DEMON?" shouted the priest.

"THERE'S A PIT IN HELL FOR YOU, FATHER..." Tomás responded, nearly levitating.

Without knowing why, I said just before fainting: "Metarraím, his name is Metarraím..."

The rest of the document was badly deteriorated. Censored in parts, I'd say. The story captivated me to the point where the hairs on my limbs stood on end. I didn't know whether to believe my grandfather's writings or consider him mad—but as I gathered my things to leave and climbed the stairs from the study, I dropped my phone. As it fell, it hit one of the buttons on the old intercom. The device began emitting static, and whether it was because I'd been immersed in the case files or because it was so late, I could have sworn I heard through the static: "Ave Metarraím."
