A man calls at 2:59 in the morning. He’s in trepidation as it has come to his knowledge that his 9 year old son isn't in his bed as he is supposed to.

The father called to file a report to the police to his conclusion that his son's bedroom window was wide open as he went to the room to check on his son. And his mentality is exploding with the line "My son has been kidnapped." Police asked anyways if by any chance perhaps, if any possibility he had run away. His guardian gave an explanation that his son was happy with the life he had and made sure that his son was living as happily as ever.


Name of the child was Ethan Kables. And within sometime, a picture of an innocent child began to show on the news on every television in town. Then

After some time, they began to hang up missing posters with his picture and in big black words; Ethan Kables.


I remember seeing a lot of the neighbors helping each other and investigators to search for the boy. At a moment of time, a lot of people from around began making a memorial for the lost boy. It took place in the center of the park that existed at the time in the little town I once called home. 


And as time went by as it usually does, they stopped searching. The police. Investigators. Neighborhood people. They just stopped. It was reported on the news that the investigation had ended and it was most likely that the 9 year old boy who had somehow disappeared into the night was dead. The boy’s father who I later found out was named Atol. To many from the town I used to live in, no one saw him a lot. A few people had seen him coming out of his house and getting into his car. And would come back a few minutes after, he would wear a face of misery as he walked into his home with cases of alcohol. And in that moment of time, a few witnesses said that in that moment of time itself, was the last time they had seen Atol Kables.


No one saw him after what witnesses say was for about a month. Mr. Kabel’s house was across the street from mine when I was young.


There was a beautiful morning that came one day as I woke up and looked out my bedroom window to find police cars and an ambulance in front of the house of Mr. Kables. Medicics were walking out the door carrying a body with a blank sheet covered on it. After a year had passed, It later came to my knowledge that Atol Kable took his own life. The neighborhood theory is that perhaps he felt as if it was his fault that he had lost his son. That perhaps he just couldn't live with that in his mind.


I was eighteen and in highschool and started to date a girl named Alex. My uncle had gotten remarried around that time and had asked me  to look after his two dogs at my house while he and his new wife went on honeymoon. At the time, I was still living in the same small town and was still under the same roof with my mother and she had no problem with the idea that my uncle had. So I happily obliged. I was thrilled. I’ve always liked dogs but unfortunately due to landlord’s policy at the time, large animals such as cats and dogs were forbidden to stay on the property. The dogs both ran to the living room as soon as I let them in. My mom was heading out to one of her friend’s parties, and she had explained to me that she most likely wasn’t going to return until the next morning. After she had left, I called Alex to come over to visit. 


She came over. And by all means, she was beautiful. Later that night, I found myself on the living room couch as a movie was playing, and Alex was asleep as she laid on my left shoulder. And my uncle’s two huskies laid on the carpet in front of the TV as well as the beautiful girl next to me.

I couldn’t go back to sleep. So to keep myself occupied, I was flipping through the channels to find something to watch. And then a noise then made itself clearly.


Tap Tap Tap

Tap Tap

Tap Tap Tap Tap


The sound came from one of the windows in the room. The noise still keeps going. I stood up and tried to hear closely to find out where it had been coming from. And then I heard ,


Knock Knock Knock


At the front door. I quietly walked to the kitchen and tried to find the largest knife I could. And before I could see who it was that was behind the door through the peephole, I noticed terror existed in my uncle’s two huskies as they both balled up in the corner, whimpering in fear. And I have never seen dogs act like this in my entire life. I began to get scared. Fear started to grow. I took the chance and looked slowly through the small glass on the door, and whoever it was that stood behind the door that one, I could see was their back as they walked away into the dark. “Hey, what's going on? The dogs are shaking.” Alex said. She had awoken. 

To continue the night together, Alex and I went upstairs to watch a movie and then we would go to sleep after. We kept the dogs with us in the room.

There is a brief moment at night when signals are created and sent to your brain to wake you up in the dark as your partner is asleep. And when that usually happens, I would soldier it through and try to go back to sleep. But for some reason on that night I didn’t.


I believe that we’ve all been in a situation when we wake up in the middle of the night and we would sometimes hear things. Distant voices or odd

noises coming from the dark hallway that makes fear grow inside you as you look into the darkness for only a second. And even within a second, that is how fast fear can grow. So when I heard this specific noise on this particular night, I tried to ignore it as long as I could. But the sound kept taking over my mind. And it kept roaming around in the night. This is what I heard, and it is the best way I can describe it : 


Rrraaaaaaahhhh

Cllaaaaahhh

Reeeeeeeee


I slowly took a small peek outside my window. I could not believe that everyone else’s homes were completely dark. I did not see anyone outside, nor who or what was making that shrieking noise. I crawled back to bed next to Alex and tried to go back to sleep. I then heard another, Reeeeeeeee. I froze. A feeling I cannot describe grew inside me. But with this feeling I had, it didn’t allow me to move. 


I was afraid to move. 


My mother laughed at me the next day. I told her about the previous events from the other night. I spent the rest of the day playing on my game system. When the afternoon was rolling around, I took the dogs out for a stroll through the forest. The wooded area had tall trees that formed as if they were giants, which in a way they were. And they did. Strange noises issued all around the forest. And the dogs whimpered in fear.

The memory of them being scared the other night gave me a weird feeling in my stomach. I didn’t hesitate to turn around and try to make my way back home. I continued to take the path I’ve taken before, and I noticed something on the tree bark I didn’t notice from before. From 4 different trees around the path I took, there revealed what seemed to be fresh scratch marks. They looked like they were made by some kind of large animal. But as well, I didn’t see nor hear any animals near me. I just got out of that area quickly.


That night, as I layed in bed, I found myself staring at the ceiling. I check the time on my nightstand. It was 2:59am. Now I have mentioned before that there are signals that wake you up in the middle of the night for reasons probably no one could recall. When I woke up, my mouth was dry. So I decided to get up for water. And as I did, I passed my bedroom window. And from the outside, there are streets in a pattern in the neighborhood. There were some that were in front of a home, and some didn’t have one. That was the pattern. My house had one. And from the corner of my eye, through the curtains, I saw something. 


I walked slowly towards the window and from the bottom corner, I pulled up a small bit of the sheet that covered my window. My heart was pounding fast. And there was a child, standing in front of the front door, and he was looking right up at me. It felt like we had stared at one another for years, but it had only been a few seconds. And after those few seconds, I fell back and the certain shut itself. 


His pitch black eyes are what terrified me the most. The way this child looked had sent signals to my brain that I have seen this other human being before. I’ve tried to recall where I have seen this boy before. And then flashbacks begin to start, and they have revealed that the child who was standing outside was the missing kid from the previous years. 


I slowly crawled back to my window. My conscience was crying out for me not to look at the window. But I had to make sure that it was really him. I took a small peak. He was walking around the front yard. He acted as if he was looking for something. I was only able to get a small look from one of the sides on his face. I sat down on the floor and pulled out my cell phone. And I researched the name Ethan Kables. A digital ad popped up on my screen. A missing ad for a child that looked exactly like the one that is standing outside. 


Someone is slamming on the door. And the dogs again whimpered in fear. They both went to the corner and tried to comfort one another. My mother storms into my room. She had a look of confusion and shock on her face. 

“Do you hear that?” she whispered. I nodded. “I’ll get the bat.” My mother then ran into her bedroom to retrieve the weapon. All of a sudden, we heard the sound of glass breaking. The dogs barked but remained in the

same position as before. My mother came out and for me to stay in my room and for me to lock my door. I obeyed. I heard ran down the stairs, as she made it down to the living room I heard her yell,

“Where the fuck are you, Motherfucker?!”. 


No answer. I hear her again as she yells this time, “Show yourself!”

Again, silent. A sound of glass breaking again appears in the air. I could hear my mother screaming “Hey!” to the intruder. I heard shuffling between objects from around the house. I walked slowly towards my bedroom window. I was about to lift up the curtain. I suddenly hear the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs. My heart starts pounding again. The door swung open, and my adrenaline had slowed down when I saw it was my mother who had opened the door. She had explained to me that the intruder ran off.


My heart sank to my stomach when she also mentioned that the intruder looked like it had been a child. 


When the next day rolled around, my uncle was surprised to hear about what had befell the night before. He picked up his dogs that afternoon. It later came to my knowledge when I overheard a conversation from my mother as she was speaking to one of her friends that my uncle was sent to a mental institution. Supposedly when the day came to where he picked up his dogs from my house, something uncanny occurred later that night.


From the one of the nurses I had later spoke to who had given my uncle medicine. Her report was that my uncle had heard a noise in the dark as he was asleep in his bed. He woke from the noise, and next to his bedroom window, he found two huskies skins on the floor. He was frightened.


He turned around and found two huskies that looked exactly like the skinned ones. And in the report, he described to the psychologist that his two dogs stood up on two legs like a man.Their legs and arm’s bones had then straightened and they both removed their paws, as they were gloves and they revealed that there were hands underneath them. Both then grew two times larger. Some part of their skin ripped as they’re bodies got bigger. And his words, he said “they then changed their forms. They’re spines showed.”


They then spoke in a language my uncle had never heard of. And that’s where his story ends. My uncle didn’t remember what happened after nor didn’t recover from what happened.The police later got a call from him and he told his story. When they got there, they found the animal skins. I then later learned that my uncle took his own life two months after he was sent to the institution.
