I should’ve left when the old woman warned me.

Graven Hollow wasn’t on any map I had. My GPS blinked out right after my car coughed its last breath near the rusted town sign. I thought it would be the perfect place to shoot some eerie B-roll for the documentary I was working on. Forgotten towns always have good bones for horror stories.

But this one… this place felt wrong.

The people stared too long and spoke too little. When I asked about the clock tower at the town square—the one looming like a spine through the fog—they tensed up. One woman, eyes cloudy like old milk, took my arm and whispered, “Don’t stay awake when it chimes thirteen.”

I laughed. Thirteen? It sounded like a ghost story. Exactly what I came for.

That night, I set up my equipment in the square. Cameras. Audio recorders. Notebooks. I wanted to catch the full chime sequence on tape. Document the mystery.

Midnight approached. The air grew thick, like syrup in my lungs. The town was silent. No bugs, no wind, not even the sound of my own breath.

Then—BONG.

The first chime hit like a slap. Sharp. Echoing.

BONG.

The second, deeper. Almost mournful.

They kept coming. Each one a little more off. Warped. Out of tune. Like the bell was slowly rusting from the inside out.

BONG. Eleven.

BONG. Twelve.

And then, it happened.

BONG. Thirteen.

Everything snapped.

My ears rang. My vision twisted like an old VHS tape warping mid-play. I felt like I was falling inside myself.

Then—I woke up.

Same motel room. Coffee was hot again. My equipment untouched. My notes… blank.

The clock read 11:57 p.m.

I thought I’d dreamed it. Until it happened again.

And again.

And again.

I tried everything—leaving town, smashing the tower, hiding in the woods. But no matter what I did, I always ended up back in that room, three minutes before midnight. And every time, I remembered more. Every time, the chimes got closer.

I started seeing things—shadows in mirrors that didn’t belong, townspeople who blinked too slow, grinned too wide. Eventually, I stopped hearing their voices. They just… mouthed things at me. Like they knew I couldn’t hear over the ringing.

By the twenty-seventh loop, I knew I wasn’t alone anymore.

Something stood at the base of the tower during each thirteenth chime. A tall, faceless thing in tattered black robes. Watching. Waiting. It stepped closer every time.

One night, I snapped. During the thirteenth chime, I screamed. I shouted over it, cursed the tower, begged anything to set me free.

And it did.

I woke up in a new motel, in a new town. The clock on the nightstand blinked.

11:57 p.m.

The coffee was warm. My notes were blank. The air was still.

I laughed. Cried. Thought I made it out.

Until I heard it again—faint and distant:

BONG.

The first of thirteen.

I didn’t escape the loop.

I just found another one.

And now that you’ve read this, I need to ask:

What time is it?
Did you hear it too?
…Don’t stay awake.
