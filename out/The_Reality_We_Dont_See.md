Hello, my name is Charlie Daniels. I came here to this forum with this post as a last ditch effort to get the word out. You probably don’t know. Nobody does, or at least wants to know. Let me start from the beginning.

I was staying with my grandmother’s house for the weekend. Her house is in a rural area surrounded by trees. I was fine with that. Gave me more space to goof off when I was younger. But nowadays, I’d rather stay inside and either play video games or watch TV. But my grandmother wasn’t having any of that. She wanted me to be outside and running around, ignoring the fact that I’m not a little kid anymore. So I begrudgingly put on my shoes and headed out onto the carport.

I saw it was dark, which was very unusual since it was only nine in the morning. And I was hearing a siren. God, that damned siren! When I turned to the front entrance to find the source of the siren, I froze in fear. What I saw shook me to this day. It was the source of the siren. Whatever it was, it was huge. The glowing eyes all almost reached the roof of the carport. And then I realized they were just bending down, and that they weren’t just one, but four or five. I couldn’t really tell since it was pitch black. And no matter the movement they each made, they always looked like they were watching me. I quickly got my phone out of my pocket and took a picture, knowing nobody would believe me without it. As soon as I took the picture, the siren was replaced by screeching so vile, I’m surprised I didn’t go deaf.

I rushed inside once I got back my common sense. Once I did, I was met with my grandmother. She wasn’t happy that I was coming back inside so soon, but she could tell I saw something out there, so she left me alone for the moment. About ten minutes later I had finally calmed down enough to tell her what happened and what I saw. Of course, she didn’t believe me. I’m surprised she didn’t hear the siren or the screech since they were so loud. So I showed her the picture. What she saw was unfortunately not what I had taken. Instead  of pitch blackness with spotlight eyes, she saw her front yard in a beautiful sunny day. She scolded me for lying, which sucked. And then made me go back outside. I was very reluctant, but she persisted.

So I went outside again expecting the previous sight and sounds, only to find that they were all gone. There were birds chirping in the trees, cicadas buzzing in the distance, and it was a beautiful sunny day. I thought that I’d imagined it myself. So I got my phone out of my pocket to see if the picture was what I thought it was. And it was just what I’d taken. Pitch blackness with spotlight eyes. I knew that something wasn’t right. I was feeling uneasy, like I was being watched. I know that all sounds crazy, but I know what I saw! I even posted a picture that’s above this post. Hopefully you guys can see it. I tried telling other people and showing the picture as evidence, but they always see the same thing my grandmother saw, so they all thought I was going crazy. Maybe I am. I don’t know anymore. This is my last ditch effort to get the word out. I realize now that they are some sort of higher being controlling reality, controlling us like their puppets. And the ones that step out of line gets silenced. Unfortunately for me, I stepped out of line. I saw them. And they know it. And now that I tried to tell everybody, they’re trying to silence me. The feeling that I’m being watched never went away even after leaving my grandmother’s house. And that was a few days ago. I haven’t slept since. I’m scared for my life. So if you see this post, please, I’m begging you, share it with everyone. I don’t know how much time I have left. Thank you for your time reading this.

My name is Janice Sanford, and I’m a detective working on this case regarding the disappearance of Charlie Daniels. We asked his parents about the last time they saw him, and they said that they saw him last in his bedroom, typing frantically on his computer. At first, we thought he was playing a video game. But then we came across this post, which got uploaded the day he went missing. Unfortunately, it didn’t help with our investigation. It was a picture from the inside of a carport showing a front lawn in some rural area during a beautiful sunny day. The post itself was only talking about a weekend trip at his grandmother’s, and the rest is blank. We will be sure to update if we find any leads in this case.
