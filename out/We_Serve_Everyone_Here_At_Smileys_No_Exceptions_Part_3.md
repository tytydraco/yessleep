I’m back again to update you guys on my unfortunate experiences working at a haunted fast food restaurant. If you want to, you can read [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ljpvrb/we_serve_everyone_here_at_smileys_no_exceptions/) and [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lkq3q5/we_serve_everyone_here_at_smileys_no_exceptions/), but it’s a lot of words and I don’t blame you for not wanting to read it. Just keep in mind that random freaks like to order, and I have to serve them in special ways or unspeakable horrors will occur. (Yeah, totally normal.)

There’s a new night shift worker—Ryan introduced him to me. He looks about 50, with some gray hairs peeking through his “black” hair. (I’m pretty sure I’ve seen it stain his collar.) His name’s Phil, and he seems like a decent guy? He hasn’t given me a reason to dislike him yet, at least.

I gave Phil the rundown—how to stock the soda fountains, how to use the fryers, and not to open the freezer if it’s banging (you know, the usual). When I mentioned the unique rules we follow here, Phil just chuckled, winked at me, and said,

“Oh, I’m sure. I’ll make sure to do all that.”

I insisted I wasn’t joking—that he really needed to follow them. He waved me off,

“My ex-wife used to be into all that new-age spiritualism and spirit-talking, and trust me—the only thing it killed was our marriage.”

He laughed. A deep belly laugh. The kind only someone going through a midlife crisis can manage.

I let Phil run the kitchen while I did drive-thru. The customers weren’t bad—I’ve gotten used to most of them—and if anything happened inside, I could handle it. Phil didn’t seem like he was planning on dealing with it.

Everything was going fine. A decently busy night, with only one or two “unique” customers. (Nuggets came back—I hadn’t seen him in a few weeks.) A family of mannequins ordered from a white van. Weird, but not even top five around here.

Phil was holding up, more or less. I had to keep telling him to stop smoking in the kitchen, but other than that? Fine.

Then the freezer started banging.

I had warned him. Just let it be. It goes away on its own. But Phil was not the “leave it alone” type. He marched over and yanked the freezer door open.

“What the hell is that thing?” he yelled, as I ran into the kitchen. before I could stop him, he stepped inside and pulled the door shut behind him.

Well. There goes our newest employee. Sucks. It was nice having company.

Loud thuds followed, and a shriek echoed through the kitchen. Then—silence.

I turned to walk away.

The freezer door creaked open.

I forgot to lock the freezer.

Whatever thing was in there was coming for me next. I bolted toward the door, praying I could lock it in time—and saw Phil step out.

“Shouldn’t be a problem no more,” he said, wiping his hands. “Found the hole that thing had been using to get in. Covered it up real good.”

He said it like he hadn’t just gone hand-to-hand a demon pig.

Hole?

I’ve checked the freezer before. Just out of curiosity. Never found anything.

“What was in there?” I asked.

“Just some kind of raccoon. It was real messed up, though. Must’ve been hit by a car. No hair. I think there was an extra arm growing out of it.”

I must’ve looked horrified.

“What? You never seen a raccoon before?”

At the end of shift, Ryan came in and asked how Phil’s training went. I gave him the basics. Left out the freezer incident. Ryan might’ve gotten Phil in trouble—and honestly? Phil’s kind of grown on me.

“That’s good!” Ryan said, smiling. “I’m sure he’ll be a great fit—don’t go in there.”

Phil had started to open the white door in the lobby.

“This isn’t the pisser?” he asked.

“Bathroom’s over there,” Ryan said, pointing at the clearly labeled door. “No one’s supposed to go in there unless the owner says so.”

He leaned in and whispered, once Phil was out of earshot.

“Anyone who goes in there never comes back.”

A shiver ran up my spine. Ryan had never been that direct before.

“But don’t worry. As long as you work hard, you’ll never need to go in there.”

“Got it,” I muttered.

“Good! Now go clock out and enjoy your day.”

 

 

Things were going well for the next few weeks. Phil and I started alternating shifts, only working together on the busy nights. I developed a pretty good system to make sure I got all my work time, and that left me with time to organize the “Smiley’s Special Guest Reference.”

I sorted entries by indicators like “Affects Headset” or “Affects Cameras.” Figured it’d be easier to use in the heat of the moment.

One night, while reorganizing the pamphlet, a car pulled into the drive-thru. I grabbed my headset.

“Yeah, can I get a 5 Combo, please?” the voice buzzed through. “With a medium fry on the side. No salt. And a Smiley Meal—but apples instead of fries.”

Oddly specific order. Way more thought than we usually get from stoned teenagers ordering four burgers.

“Absolutely,” I said. “Pull up and pay at the window.”

As the car approached, something felt off. The voice was familiar, which wasn't too odd; we get repeat customers. But something was off about the order. I'm almost positive someone had ordered the exact same thing earlier.

Then the car reached the window. I looked up—and almost jumped out of my skin.

The driver had no face.

Just a pale, smooth head with dents where the eyes should’ve been. Its mouth stretched into a massive, toothy grin—rows of long, jagged yellow teeth.

I kept it together. Somehow. It handed me cash—bony, pale fingers with black veins and crooked brown nails.

Carefully grabbing the money and putting it into the register, I said, “I’ll have your food out in a moment.”

I started closing the window. It shot its arm forward, gripping my hands with its cold, clammy fingers.

“Make sure you get my order right,” it rasped.

“Of course,” I replied, turning away and gasping for air.

What the hell was that? Was I supposed to do something *before* it ordered? Was it already too late?

I grabbed the pamphlet and flipped like my life depended on it. (It probably did.)

There it was:

**Copy Cat**  
Will mimic a previous customer’s voice and order, and may insert a substitution.  
You must serve the original order.

That was it. That’s what had been bothering me. But what *was* the original order?

My mind scrambled to remember. 5 combo, medium fry with no salt, and a Smiley meal with apples?

Or was it fries?

Think, Andrew. I always stock apples at the start of every shift. If a pack’s missing then it means the order comes *with* apples

I opened the cooler.

The container was missing a pack.

Got it—apples for the Smiley meal.

Unless I forgot to restock?

And what if the original order did have salt?

My heart raced.

Out of the corner of my eye—I saw it.

The eyeless face was pressed against the window; its breath condensed on the glass.

It *knew* I didn’t remember.

I had to choose. Fast.

I cooked a 5 combo, medium fry *with* salt, and added a Smiley Meal with apples. No-salt fries are weird enough that I *would* have remembered.

At the window, I handed it the bag.

“Can you tell me what I ordered?” it asked, it's grin growing impossibly wide.

“A 5 combo, medium fry, and a Smiley Meal with apples,” I replied, voice cracking.

“Are you sure?”

Its hand hovered just above the bag.

No. I wasn’t. I had no idea if I got it right.

“Yes.”

It stared.

Then—slowly—the grin faded.

“Have a good night,” it said, and drove off.

I stood frozen. Was the order right? Would he have told me if it was wrong? I had no way to find out.

The rest of the night was a blur. Every sound made me jump. Every shadow felt like it was staring at me.

Eventually, the sun rose. 6 a.m. hit, and I said goodbye to the opener.

I’m writing this now in the parking lot, hoping that putting it down somewhere will calm me down. It’s not working

I don’t know how much more of this I can take.
