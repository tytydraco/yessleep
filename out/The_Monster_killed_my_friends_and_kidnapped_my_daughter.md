It’s been ten years since I saw him—Fibby. That jester. That monster.

But it feels like yesterday. His laughter still echoes in my dreams, and the memories of what he did haunt every waking moment.

We thought it was a joke when he first appeared at the carnival. A goofy, awkward clown with a weird, oversized colourful polka-dot ball for a head. Fibby was funny at first, doing tricks and cracking jokes, but when the carnival lights dimmed, he became something else. Something inhuman.

My friends…they weren’t as lucky as me. Fibby broke them. He didn’t just kill them—he twisted them into something unrecognizable. His sick games turned them into his personal “toys.” He tortured them endlessly, feeding on their fear, their pain. By the time I escaped, they were begging for death, but Fibby wouldn’t grant them even that mercy.

I survived, but I was never free. He stalked me, watching from the shadows, taunting me with whispers I couldn’t escape. My family didn’t believe me. Who would? A colourful polka-dotted jester with a flesh-covered face and a penchant for destruction? I must have sounded insane.

Two years later, the police found Fibby’s hideout. I was called in to confirm what they’d discovered. I can’t describe what I saw without wanting to vomit. The victims—my friends—were gone. Fibby had eaten them. Slaughtered them like animals. There was blood on the walls, mutilated remains displayed like trophies.

But they never caught him. No one believed me when I told them what he really was. How could they?

The breaking point came the night he took everything from me.

It was storming that night. I woke up to the sound of shattering glass, the horrible laughter I knew all too well. By the time I reached the living room, it was too late. My husband was dead, his lifeless body sprawled across the floor. Blood everywhere. And my youngest daughter—barely three years old—was gone.

Fibby didn’t stop there. He’d taken my older daughter too, but not before leaving a message scrawled in blood:
“Catch me if you can.”

I chased him into the woods, barely thinking, running on pure adrenaline. When I found him, my older daughter was standing there, unharmed—but she was smiling. Smiling like she was happy.

Fibby stood behind her, his grotesque form illuminated by the moonlight. He leaned down, his face inches from hers, and said one last thing:
“She’s mine now.”

Then he vanished. Just like that.

It’s been ten years. I’ve been living with the guilt, the rage, the endless need for revenge. My older daughter hasn’t been seen since that night, and I know she’s alive. I can feel it. Fibby didn’t just kill my family—he destroyed me.

This isn’t just some monster. Fibby is the final reincarnation of pure evil. The devil himself.

And if I ever see him again, I’ll make sure he suffers like I have.

For my family. For my friends. For everyone he’s ever hurt.

Fibby…if you’re reading this, I will find you and I will fucking kill you
