I had just sat through my last lecture. My friend Gabriel and I were going to leave together.  
  
We started walking out on the campus when I remembered something.  
  
“Gabriel, sorry I forgot my calculator. Wait here while I get it back”  
  
“Sure take your time”  
  
I rushed back through the crowd of students and arrived at the lecture hall. I spotted my calculator. 
As soon as I picked it up, the door closed behind me.   
  
And suddenly everything went quiet. The hundreds of footsteps, the countless side conversations echoing through the walls. The sounds of the birds chirping. All gone.  
  
I exited the lecture hall. No one was there.   
  
“Hello?” I yelled out.  
  
The students were nowhere to be found. No cars on the road. The sky looked different, almost an unnatural shade of pink. I started panicking and ran to the bathroom. I turned on the faucet and washed my face. Hoping it was a bad dream I closed my eyes and hoped the noises would come back, the silence was deafening.   
  
I kept them closed until suddenly, in an instant. Everything came back. I could hear the students again, walking, talking, the sky was clear.  
  
I ran through the crowd to find Gabriel and I hugged him.  
  
“Are you okay?” Gabriel said with a hint of worry in his tone. 
  
“You wouldn’t believe what happened, I can’t explain it, but everything was gone. No one was around!”  
  
“Wow that sounds… Interesting, let’s get on our way home and you tell me what happened.”  
  
As we were walking and I was explaining to him this story, I noticed that he didn’t move his eyes from me, the entire walk his eyes were fixated on me. His face was also building up through a smile, it started off nice, but crept into a wide grin with dead eyes set on me.  
  
When I checked around us, I realized everyone was watching me, eyes wide open, not making any sounds. Then, Gabriel stuck out his leg and tripped me onto the street. As soon as I was on the ground, a bus appeared, almost as if premeditated.   
  
The bus drove over to my side of the street and struck me in the skull. The wheels didn’t get over me, but rather rubbed against my skin with terrible friction. I could hear the bus revving and trying to get over my hurdle of a head.   
  
I screamed in agony, but Gabriel was just standing there, with a wide grin. The bus kept upping the force until the wheel had rubbed the hair and skin off my face and smashed into my head, I heard my brains splatter. The bus was now able to keep going and drove off as if nothing happened.   
  
Everyone around was standing still and looking. Then, one by one they started smiling, wide grins invaded their faces. They stood there until my body gave out. Then all together they went back to walking, talking, the birds went back to chirping.
