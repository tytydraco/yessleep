You just finished showering. You feel refreshed and clean. You lifted up both of your legs to get out of the bath one by one. You then smile when you realize that you are on a roadtrip and away from school. You feel even more happy when you realize that your partner is taking the trip with you. 
You look in the mirror. You dry yourself and get your clothes to get dressed.
Your straight dark brown hair is wet so you dry it with one of the hair dryers you brought with you from home, back from london. You then look into the reflection of the mirror and your eyes immediately catch what's behind you. Next to the bathroom door, there stood a tall man wearing a faceless mask. 

Your heart skips a beat and then you realize that his clothes were dark and wet. You then think to yourself that maybe this was all just a bad dream. But you know it's not.

You then remember your boyfriend, Adam, is in the living room, watching the TV. How come he isn't here to save me? Who was this guy and how did get into our cabin? Did this man kill Adam?

No, you can’t think like that. You just can’t.

This person is now at your full view- right in front of you. You want to cry but you hold it in, in hopes this man won’t attack for that. He jerks his head, as if he was some type of animal. You immediately run for life as you sped past him.You head towards your room and lock the door behind you. You cover your mouth as quietly as possible to cover your sobbing. 

You got your backpack and grabbed a jacket that Adam had gotten for you on your birthday a year ago. Then you quickly head to the window next to your bed but to your horror, the man in the faceless mask appears out of nowhere from the other side of the glass. He placed both of his gloved- covered hands on the glass. You jumped in fear and backed away from the mattress. You ran out from the room and headed to the living room in search of your keys but you then remember that Adam had them last. You get so pissed off for that. 

You called out for your boyfriend but there was no answer. He is nowhere around. All of sudden, you see your cellphone on the ground. You picked it up in hopes to answer you. Your heart starts to pound hard as you hear the other line ringing, but then the only sound that exists in that moment was static. You then hear a raspy voice on the other line-

“Sallie.. Your next..”

You immediately throw the phone to the ground and you wonder to yourself what the hell is going on?

You search through one of the drawers in the kitchen. You find a small gun and a lighter. You know you need to find a way out of this mess. You can feel the fear under your skin. You slowly make your way to the front door. You wanna put your hand on the door knob but a knock sounds straight towards you. 

Knock

Knock

Knock 
 
You hear the knocking but a voice comes through- behind the door,

“Hey babe. I left my phone inside the room. Could you open the door?”

You calm down, and quickly start to realize that maybe this was all just your mind playing with you.

“Adam is here. Nothing bad is going to happen.”

You then start to wipe the tears off your face. You take off the latch from the door and to your surprise, standing in front of you, the same man you saw before, the one with the faceless mask, was in your full view. He was such a tall man, he grabbed you by your hair. You can feel that he is pulling your hair way too hard as he is dragging you out of the cabin. 

You can feel the fear coming back to you. It's coming back to haunt you.

This person- this monster- whoever or whatever he was, did not speak to you. He could look at you and you would already be terrified. You get scared that you are not even praying for your rescue to come and save you. 

You just want all of it to go away. 

You remember when you were thirteen, you had received a dog for christmas and you were so happy, or you remember when you received awards for being the best student in school. You then start to have flashbacks on how you met Adam. But somewhere through your life, something felt off. Something didn’t seem right. You then remember that you have seen this man before. The man that is dragging you by your hair. You have seen his face before. He would sometimes hide from a distance as he would watch you and what you had gone through within your life. 

You remember how you would sometimes hear tapping from your window as a little girl but you could never find what was there. And now, your childhood monster is coming back for you. 

You then snap back to reality. The man had dropped you in the dirt. You look up and see his hideous- deformed face when he takes off his mask. You then remember that you had a gun and use your first shot on the man’s leg. He screams as he falls, screaming in pain. You then got up from the ground and ran away from him. Your mind then starts to wonder, “Where the hell is Adam?”

“Did he just leave you in this mess?”
You tell yourself, “Don’t look back- Don’t look back.”

You keep on running towards the woods. You pass by tall trees, and in the end, you are running towards the darkness. You just kept on going that you had gotten lost and couldn’t find your way to the rescue station. You now don’t know what to do. 

The sound of nature at night had taken its place. The only piece of light that existed with you was coming from the moon. You are cold and alone and scared. You continue to keep on walking in the shadows. You try to process what had just happened. You then start to cry. 

The sound of leaves breaking is heard from behind you. 

“I’m not alone..” you thought to yourself. 

You don’t want to look at what is behind you. You want to- No- You need to but you still won’t. You then start to smell something familiar. Adam’s cologne. 

Tears start to fall from your eyes even harder. You prepare yourself and pull out the gun from your pocket. A hand is placed on your shoulder from behind. You slowly look at what is behind you. This man who had followed you for years is now wearing your boyfriend’s face as his own. His expression showed how he was terrified in his last moments. You scream in horror. 

The man then grabs you by the neck and lifts you up in the air. It’s quiet. You only hear the sound of your heart beating. You know something is going to happen. And then something sharp goes through your chest. The horrible sound of your blood running out of you. And then you finally figure out what is happening.
