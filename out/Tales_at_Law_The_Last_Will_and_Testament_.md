I am still a lawyer! For now.

My disbarment hearing was postponed for another two weeks. Something about a last minute witness, unlikely to be good for me. Not that it matters, I’m not exactly in the headspace to be practicing law at the moment so being barred for two more weeks is neither here nor there.

While I have the time, I figured I’d share another story to take my mind off my impending disbarment. This one takes place after I left the [public defender’s office](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fihas4/what_being_an_attorney_is_actually_like/).

I had recently joined an (almost) full-service private law firm. They handled EVERYTHING (except for family law and criminal law). I wasn’t sure what practice area I wanted to join, they just liked that I had trial experience. Funnily enough, I ended up handling very little trial work during my tenure but that’s beside the point.

My first year or so there was spent in their estate planning unit. I won’t bore you with legal jargon (and will explain it as necessary) but I’ll split it up into two parts. There’s (1) the planning side and (2) the administration side. We handled both. As you can imagine, the planning side involved a lot paperwork, hours dedicated to pushing paper and writing lengthy legal clauses. The administration side, on the other hand, was drama-central. 

I remember when my managing partner popped into my office and dropped the subject case file onto my desk. She didn’t knock, it’s rare that someone does in an active legal office, and unless we were on a client call, the door had to be open. Something about making sure we were available.

It was a thick manila folder, no client name on the label, stuffed with papers. And yes, I understand in the 21st century that everything is online, and we DID have an electronic case managing system. Old habits die hard and this particular partner LOVED printing things out. So I got the paper file, inclusive of every thought, email, memo, or otherwise about the estate.

“You remember the estate?” She asked nonchalantly, without a glance up from the phone in her hand, no doubt putting out another fire (read: checking email, texting your spouse, scrolling social media, etc., anything that wasn’t actual work).

“Whose estate?”

“Well he died. Son’s asking for us to administer it.”

I repeated, “Whose estate?”

“Client agreement’s signed, bill under the Kellerman matter. Should be in the system, and use the timer please.” (We bill every 6 minutes for our time, less than 6? Round up.) I had a bad habit of not using the timer and letting minutes slip through the cracks here and there. It’s tedious, okay, this is a no judgment zone, if anything, be happy that I never overcharged a client… even if it only resulted from forgetting to do so.

I’ll break down the client file for you. Dead Kellerman had a Will. In theory, that allows someone to divide their property in whatever way they want. This can make some people angry, for obvious reasons. In short, my job was to read the Will, collect all the stuff, notify all relevant parties, and distribute it. 

This Will was a doozy. Three ex-wives, eight kids split between them, three more step kids, too many grandchildren to list, and one illegitimate child. 

I stared at the open manila folder, feeling a sense of dread settle in my stomach. Outside of my overwhelming caseload, the complexity of the Kellerman estate was daunting. I flipped through the pages, noting the numerous names and the tangled web of relationships. Each connection held a potential grudge, a whispered resentment, or a long-buried secret that I desperately did not wish to know.

Over the next few weeks as I delved deeper into the intricacies of the Kellerman estate, a nagging sensation that I was missing something crept over me. I began receiving strange phone calls from the various members of the Kellerman family. My phone would ring once but when I went to answer I was greeted by nothing but silence. At first, I brushed it off. I’ve death with my fair share of clients and I understood that most people’s first interactions with lawyers is on the worst day of their lives, so trepidation is expected. 

But the calls started escalating, becoming more frequent, targeting me at home at all hours of the day and night. Then the letters started, again from seemingly every member of the family. Each letter containing blank pages of paper.

I thought it was some sort of cruel prank — an odd family ritual or a manifestation of grief, trust me, I’ve seen weirder. But the silence was unnerving. Each time I opened a fresh envelope, the blank pages seemed to taunt me, their emptiness a haunting echo ever-present in my mind. 

One night, unable to shake the feeling of being watched, I began digging deeper in the Kellerman files, scouring every document, every email, and any hint of the family’s history that might offer some explanation for this strange behavior. As I pored over the estate planning documents, I noticed something odd about the Will. In the section detailing distribution of assets, there were handwritten notes in the margin — scribbled words that felt like whispers from beyond the grave. They were almost illegible but I could make out a few words, here and there, “betrayal,” “revenge,” “never forget.”

Suddenly my phone rang, causing me to jump. I checked the time, 1:05AM. I rubbed my bloodshot eyes, wondering who could be calling at this hour. I picked it up, cautiously, half-expecting silence, but this time a voice crackled through the line. A raspy, disembodied voice that sent chills down my spine. 

“Stop looking. You can’t afford to know.”

I dropped the phone, paralyzed with fear. My heart raced and my instincts told me to abandon this case, to let some other unfortunate associate take it on, but I was in too deep. The thought of losing my position, my reputation, haunted me more than the calls or the letters.

The next morning, I returned to my office with a sense of dread. My managing partner greeted me with a strange, knowing smile that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. 

“Figure it out yet?” She asked, voice low, a hushed whisper, almost… conspiratorial.

“Figure what out?” I stammered. 

She stepped closer, her breath reeking of coffee and cigarette tar. “The reason for the letters, the calls. The family — oh, they’re dying to get to know you, to let you in, to share their secrets, but they’re afraid. So very afraid of what might happen if the truth were to — let’s say — get out.”

I stepped back, confused. “What truth?”

She smiled, but instead of answering, simple turned and walked away. Heels clicking on the tiles of our polished office floor. 

Determined to get to the bottom of it, I abruptly left work, heading home to conduct more research without the watchful eye of my managing partner. I spent the evening researching the Kellermans, diving into local newspapers, public records, and any other source I could get my hands on. 

It was a twisted tale — murders, disappearances, allegations of abuse. As I pieced together their history, I came to the realization that the estate wasn’t just about money or property; it was a minefield of long-buried grudges, and the Kellermans had buried more than just their dead.

That night, staring blankly at article after article, surrounded by the weight of the Kellerman files, I felt like Sisyphus. As I poured myself another cup of coffee from my third pot of the day, my computer screen flickered and went dark. I cursed under my breath and got up to check the breaker. A cold draft brushed past me causing me to stop in my tracks, despite the still air of my apartment. 

And then, my phone rang. I picked up, not even eking out a yellow before a voice so raspy it was as if I was being spoken to by a fork in a blender, whispered, “You’re in over your head, lawyer.” And the line went dead.

I felt a chill crawl up my spine. I felt like I was being hunted.

The next day, I summoned the courage to confront the surviving family members, one by one. Each encounter sent me sprawling deeper into their madness — eyes flickered with fear, anger simmered just beneath the surface, and each family member mirrored the others’ paranoia. They all spoke in hushed tones, as if someone was listening, as if the walls themselves had ears. 

By the end of the week, I could no longer eat, I could no longer sleep. 

I was a ghost of myself, consumed by the need to understand. The calls grew more frequent, the letters felt heavier, more menacing, each one taunting me with the emptiness of their pages, the secrets they threatened to spill. I was drawn into a darkness I couldn’t shake off, despite my rational mind screaming for me to walk away. 

On the day of the asset distribution, the family gathered in the conference room of my office. It was the first time I had stepped foot back in the office since the last encounter with my managing partner. 

The tension was palpable, faces glared across the polished conference table, each relative a simmering pot of resentment, of hate. I had prepared to confront them as a whole, to lay bare the pieces I had picked up from each of them, to unravel the tangled web of their lives, and to bring some clarity to the chaos that was the Kellerman family.

As I began outlining the distribution of assets, the atmosphere shifted. A woman — Kellerman’s second wife — stood up, hands trembling, and stuttered out, “y-y-you have no IDEA what you’re dealing with.” Her voice rose, “Y-y-you’re playing with fire, y-y-young man!”

“Everyone has a claim.” I replied, trying to keep my tone even. “Let’s keep this civil.”

But it wasn’t, it never was. As I went through each provision of Dead Kellerman’s Will, tempers flared. Accusations flew like daggers. Suddenly, a man at the back of the room — Kellerman’s youngest son — slammed his fists on the table, knocking over a few files, and addressed me. “You’re just a pawn in this game, boy! You think you can fix us? You have no idea what this family has done to survive, what is asked — nay — demanded, of us.”

I recoiled at his intensity, his eyes burned with rage, a raw, desperate anger. I glanced around the room, realizing the other family members wore similar expressions, each grappling with their own hidden burdens. 

I pressed on, determined to regain control of the meeting, but I was too late. As I attempted to continue through the terms of the Will, voices rose to a cacophony. I was no longer guiding the conversation, I was in the center of a tempest. 

“Enough!” I shouted, the words escaping my lips, like a dog through an open door, before I could regain my composure. My temples throbbed as a migraine began to take hold. The room fell silent but I swear you could hear each beat of my heart. “Enough.” I repeated, more calmly this time, trying to cut through the tension. “We’re here to settle this, to honor the late Kellerman’s wishes.”

My words hung heavy in the air, seeming only to stoke the tempers of the Kellermans.

“Maybe that’s the problem,” the illegitimate child — Kellerman’s last secret — spoke up quietly, voice high, yet hardly a whisper, a stark comparison to the rest of the family. “He never wanted any of us to know about each other.”

The room erupted again, each voice echoing like the drumbeats of a battle, but this time they weren’t just fighting each other. They were fighting their guilt and complicity.

As the chaos continued to unfold, I realized I was no longer just an attorney, but a witness to a family unraveling at the seams. Their secrets suffocated them, binding them in a vicious cycle of anger and denial. I felt a wave of pity wash over me for each of them, trapped in a web they couldn’t escape.

Then, the son who had slammed the table stood up again, his eyes glistening with unshed tears. “We don’t need your help! You think you can solve this with paperwork? You’re just going to make it worse!”

At that moment, I knew he was right. The more I pushed, the more I would unravel the already frayed threads. Perhaps the only way to bring closure wasn’t through legalities but through understanding, through stepping back and allowing them to face their own demons.

A thought flickered across my mind, I could walk away, hand in the files, and let them hash it out among themselves. Maybe they needed to confront their history without me mediating their pain.

As I gathered my things to leave, the youngest son stood once more. Every eye snapped to me. His lips curled upwards in a snarl. In a voice that I recognized as the one that had been torturing me over the phone, he spat, “You think you can escape this? You think you can just walk away?”

I exhaled slowly, feeling the weight of the past week lift just a little. “It’s not me that you should be worried about. It’s each other you need to face. We’re done here.”

Anger flickered across his face for a brief moment, but he didn’t reply, and I thought, for a split second, a sense of understanding registered with him. 

I turned and walked out of the conference room, feeling free in a way I hadn’t for months. 

Looking back on it, I wish that I had heeded the Young Kellerman’s warning, for worse was yet to come…
