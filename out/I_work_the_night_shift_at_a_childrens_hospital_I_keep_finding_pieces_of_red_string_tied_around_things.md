I'm not one to be afraid. I have a pretty strong gut, and I don't get freaked out easily, so the night guard doesn't scare me. Not even morgue shifts, nothing.

This, however, is not scary. It is just... confusing.

At first, you don't really notice it. You just brush it off and it quickly leaves your mind. I'd get pulled back by walking into some string tied from the counter to the hospital bed, or trip, but most of the strings were shorter, just between a table and a vase, or hanging from a doorknob.

I though it was peculiar, but figured some of the kids must've played around.

When I counted the third time I'd tripped, I started suspecting some prankster lurking around. But, to be honest, the suspicion quickly disappeared, because the kids around here weren't in the mood for pranks.

I asked some of my colleagues about it, and they gave me weird looks. 'I haven't seen that around.'

I told you, I didn't mind being scared, but I hated being confused.

I also have a bit of a drug problem, but I keep it under control and I don't do them at work. I was out with my friends Mark and Harry one night, and, in our colorful haze, we kept saying whatever popped into our heads.

I brought up the red string incident, and they went quiet, for a bit.

'What the fuck?' laughed Mark. 'Dude, some sick kids are really playing you. You'd think they had better things to worry about.'

'That's really insensitive, man.' I replied.

'I'm just saying, they're kids. You need to be more... observant...' He threw himself on the bed, '... and, like, stop them. Or don't. Your life.'

'No, I don't think so. Something's off.'

'What could be wrong? For real, you think too much.'

Harry hadn't said anything for a while. When he spoke, his eyes were fixated on a point on the wall, and he spoke slowly. 'Did you notice a pattern or something?'

'What do you mean?'

'The strings, do they appear... in some sort of pattern? Or just randomly?'

Maybe it was the drugs, but it felt like he had reached into my mind and just put things into place. I suddenly felt so intrigued by his idea. 'Why would it be a pattern?'

'Is there a place in the hospital where you feel... off? Like, a room, or the morgue, basement...'

'I mean, I don't know, man. It's the night shift. Everything feels off. Plus, I'm kind of alone. There's like five or six of us, scattered around.'

'Do the strings seem to be blocking your way to stuff? Or, better... do they seem to point at random things? Or mark a way to, I don't know, some room?'

I rubbed my eyes. 'I don't *understand,* Harry, what do you even mean?'

'I *mean,'* Harry said, leaning in from his chair, eyes sparkling, 'maybe something is trying to communicate with you. Lure you in, or keep you out, or just fuck with you. You know these ghosts, they have queer customs.'

'Fuck off with that ghost shit.' I instantly replied, because I hated that whenever we did drugs, Harry had to be the one to bring up these paranoiac ass thoughts. 'Don't even *start,* you know last time you literally ruined my trip-'

'Just fucking listen. I'm saying, hospitals are weird places. You hear all kinds of stories there. I wouldn't exclude the possibility.'

'Possibility of what?' asked Mark, stuffing his mouth with peanuts. 'I'm so thirsty.'

'Possibility of the place being haunted.' replied Harry, smiling.

I rolled my eyes and grabbed the peanut bag from Mark. 'Shut up.'

'Are you the only one seeing the strings?'

'I don't know, I see them mostly when I'm alone, but I might have brushed one off when I was with others, too...'

'I'm just saying, pay attention to them.'

'Yeah, whatever.'

The next day, Harry didn't remember we'd had this conversation, as I expected. He had, however, done something he hadn't realized. 

He'd planted the seed of fear in my mind.

Another night shift came, and I found myself alone on the corridors. The hospital wasn't exactly old, but it had been around for some time, and the fluorescent lights made it creepier. I kept thinking about what Harry had said, and started humming the tune of Ghostbusters to just pass the time.

I'd had some business to do on the third floor of the east wing. Right as I turned the corner, ready to go through the metal doors, I saw it.

A piece of red string, tied around the doorknobs. To go through, I'd have to untie it.

I raised my hand and brushed my fingers across the knot. Another night, I would have yanked it out and sighed, but that night was different.

So I remained silent and still, waiting.

I stood there for a while, but nothing happened. However, I still didn't go through the doors. 

As I turned to leave, I saw another piece of string, hanging from a poster, in the distance. I approached it, my heart pounding. 

I thought I saw something in the corner of my eye, but it could have been just my imagination.

There were more, and my heart sank as I realized there could have been, in fact, a trail of strings.

That is when I heart a thud from behind the metal doors of the east wing. What was this? Were these strings... trying to lure me somewhere or distract me? I decided not to follow them, and headed est, towards the noise.

It turned out to be Martha, my colleague, dropping her bag. Which meant no creature had been there. I was glad my shift was almost over. I came back, no trace of strings, no nothing.

I think the trail of strings was not meant to distract me, or keep me out of something, but to lure me somewhere...

And I don't know what would have happened if I'd followed it.
