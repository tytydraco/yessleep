I dialed Sawyer on one of the laundry room phones. Call it my own personal experiment. “You have reached Professor Sawyer, to whom am I speaking?” I did not know the mad scientist well enough to know whether this was his norm or if this was a bad sign. “Hello, Doctor Sawyer. Do you recall our meeting yesterday?” I slurped on some soup. “Well, who's this?” Sawyer replied. “Brooks, we had met yesterday?” “Sorry, I don't recall any Brooks in my classes?”

Shit.

I felt I knew him well enough to know how he would respond. I tempted him with something he couldn't refuse. “May I call back in a couple hours? I can get you in touch with a fellow creative mind.” He did not hesitate, and took the bait, “Absolutely! I look forward to it!”

With one base covered, I hung up and dialed the same number, on my actual phone. “Guday, Mr Brooks! To what do I owe the pleasure?” Sawyer cheerfully picked up. “I think I have made a discovery?” After his giddiness subsided for the most part, he asked for more details. I told him I would meet up with him as soon as I got there.

“Mr Brooks! Please, I am dying to know! What exactly was this discovery of yours?” Sawyer shook my shoulders the moment I was within reach. “Down, dude. Seriously, don't go killing me.” I pleaded, pushing his hands from my shoulders. I pulled out the phone I had called the first Sawyer on, and handed it to him. “Remember a call from me,” I started. He nodded. “I spoke to you twice.”

His eyes widened at the realization. I had already explained the origin of those phones. I had forgotten to explain how I could communicate with them. Not to mention, my fingerprint not working, but that was less important. He gingerly accepted the mystery phone, dialed his own number… and someone picked up on the first ring…

“Hello again, whatever your name is!” The other Sawyer eagerly announced. Sayer prime had put the call on speakerphone. He looked at me, gesturing with his hand to keep it going. I spoke, “salutations, sir. I have here with me a very interesting fellow. His name is Professor Sawyer, and I'd imagine you may be familiar with him?”

I was not going to skirt around the matter. I cut straight to the bone. I had just put Sawyer and Sawyer on the phone together. What had I done?! Two mad scientists. Together?! An utter recipe for disaster!

“Hu-hello?” Sawyer prime shakily greeted. “What is the process by which… (some random niche science question I couldn't understand for the life of me)?” Sawyer prime seemed to answer precisely how other Sawyer would have, and the two applauded each other's brilliance. I sat there, groaning. Watching someone talk to themself, but not themself, which so much joy… was sickening in a whole different way. 

“How is this even possible?!” Other Sawyer asked. “My good friend, Mr Brooks, here, seems to keep dying. This changes matters, though.” Sawyer prime stroked his chin. Other Sawyer pitched an idea, “reality hopping?” Sawyer Prime nodded, then shook his head. “I was considering that, but that wouldn't explain the… or would it?” Sawyer Prime tossed me the phone, as he frantically erased and drew all over a whiteboard. “What did you two just realize?” I muttered. “We believe you may be dragging yourself through some form of quantum entanglement,” other Sawyer stated, simply. “Somehow you have become entangled across causality, and the moment you are in an unfavorable state, you override the result. You have rewritten your reality and dragged the favorable result into your own reality,” Sawyer prime finished, just as his diagram had been finished as well. “Thank you, me,” nothing Sawyers said in unison. I rolled my eyes again.

“English, please?” I pleaded, not at all following. “You trip. You fall. You get hurt?” Other Sawyer began. “You steal the body from a timeline where you didn't trip, fall, or get hurt,” Sawyer prime concluded.

“So what does that mean for me?” I asked, beginning to grow impatient. “Considering how little we understand about quantum theory? Not much,” Sawyer prime sighed. “But this is a monumental breakthrough! You have just discovered interdimensional communication!” Other Sawyer cheered. Is he some sort of cheerleader over there?

We had made a massive step forward, but still no solution.
