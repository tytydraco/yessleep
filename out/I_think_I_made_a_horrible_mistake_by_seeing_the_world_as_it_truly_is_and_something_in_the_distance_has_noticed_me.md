If you're reading this, you've probably read my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/170qpbu/i_think_i_made_a_horrible_mistake_by_seeing_the/k3rii8z/?context=3). If so, then welcome back! To those of you who are new, I've opened my eyes to what the world truly is. A horrid, grotesque, meaty world filled with monsters straight from Lovecraft's nightmares. I did notice someone point out a small detail, even though I don't really notice it much anymore. My RIGHT arm was the one bitten by that THING, but as I look down I see that my LEFT arm is the one currently missing. At the start of this whole mess I find myself in, I may have been worried about this revelation, but I've seen worse, more worrying paradoxical things over the course of my time SEEing. My cousin, who I'm certain was consumed by whatever was making that loud crunching noise in her house, I saw as early as a month ago, still insane but willing to offer me some "sage" words of advice: "They almost see you now, John." At the time, I brushed it off as Emma being Emma, but I realize she was right. This morning, I noticed that one of those THINGS in the distance was looking straight at me and was noticeably closer than the night before.

Some of you have told me over the past day or so to "find this" or "do that" as if I'm some big damn hero, who won't die doing stupid things near those things. What I did take notice of was someone telling me thatto remember that despite everything, I'm still just one man. Thank you, stranger, but my removal of these creatures wasn't just for everyone. I'll admit that I selfishly tried to only help those I knew and cared about. But maybe even those days are over. I don't think I'll survive if I stay here, with that monster of inexistence coming slowly to me.

 I am, however, now looking to find someone showing symptoms of "truesight," such as looking to the sky in fear or reacting to the noises these monsters make. I also have a plan—well, more like a theory—that I might be able to survive longer by traveling around. I have $500,000 left from what I inherited from an aunt who never had any kids, and that I took care of in her last days. If I ration the money carefully, I could probably last a while, but I'm probably going to use the remainder to research as much as I can about those things.I've tried in the past to get help from people who've "opened their inner eye", and some of them could see barely anything, but when I've pointed out things to them, they usually break. Going insane and harming me, others, or both.

 This isn't to say I've stopped looking, but I'm only going to look for those who might help with more mundane things like acquiring firearms and medical supplies to help fight off those things. I'm done looking for those who think they can see more than they truly can; it never works out. I think there might be something intrinsically changed through our connection to whatever deity is out there granting this, but I don't even know where to begin testing that, and I'm not very smart, poor decisions notwithstanding.Something I'm trying right now is breaking everything in Emma's basement. I know she's still "alive", or at least her body and broken mind are, but I've never seen her come back home. She might not even be "human" anymore after she came back from whatever "consumed" her. 

This is a tiny post to update you. I think I have to move, and I'll try Hawaii. I think that then I'll be far enough away to try and get my bearings without worrying about that thing coming closer, but this idea might just make it worse. I know trying to understand the giant sky things caused me to be paralyzed for two days, so wish me luck, boys. I hope to talk from Hawaii!
