As long as I could remember, I've suffered from night terrors. As a young kid, it was just things like scary Goosebumps monsters (like slappy or something) but as I grew up, they became more and more abstract. Nowadays, they're very vivid and even somewhat recurring, with there being certain things I dream of regularly 

One such entity, if you will, is somewhat similar to a character from a comic I like. He appears as a tall, dark skinned bald man in white robes with little mouths for eyes. He never says anything, and he's usually  just sitting  on a throne of bones where the landscape is replaced with large swathes of human flesh and blood. I've never heard his voice, or seen any of his mouths move, but every time I see him, I almost immediately wake up and have something in my head that I just know he told me, kinda like how in dreams, you just sometimes know something. 

Anyways, since switching to night shift at work about a week ago (im a chef incase you were wondering), I've dreamt of the mouth eye guy almost every time I sleep this week. Before then, I'd dreamed of him maybe 2 or 3 times a month.

 One of the ones I remember, only because of how weird it was, compared to most dreams starring this strange man, started with me driving down a street with my mom and brother, when we turned, and I saw the blood and guts I'd usually see, however, this time there were deer skulls on stakes off the side of the road. Sitting at the end of the road on the Familiar bone throne was the man with no eyes. Only this time, instead of just sitting as he usually did, his eye mouths open and he began crying blood. After, I woke up I was shivering and felt like i was in extreme danger and as if I was being watched. I also didn't wake up with words in my head as usual and my bedroom curtains were wide open, revealing the abyss like darkness of my back yard. 

For context, whenever I dream of the man with no eyes, I usually wake up feeling oddly safe, as if someone was protecting me. As stated, I also usually wake up with words in my head. Additionally, I live on a rural native reservation by some woods, so I always make sure my curtains are shut. I'm a big believer in my peoples legends of skin walkers and other such creatures, so looking into the woods, especially at night, terrifies me.

Anyways, as stated, he's been in my dreams almost every night this week. This Wednesday, my dream started out with me and my fiancee on a date. We were walking around a mall, and when we turned a corner, the walls turned to flesh and the throne of bones were there. When I woke up, i was told, "watch the moon, things are amiss in the cosmos". Usually, the things are a lot more cryptic, so this was actually kinda strange. 

On Thursday, I was i was back in high school, using the restroom. After I finished my business, and turned to go wash my hands, there was the flesh and throne again. I looked at the man with no eyes, and woke up. This time, he said, "when the lunar body reaches its apex, he will awaken". I noticed, on my drive to work that night that the moon would be full in a couple days. 

Last night, on Saturday I had a dream I was at work. I was carrying a tub of dishes back to the dish washer, yet when I went through the double doors to get to the kitchen, he was there. This time, he stared down at me, and I woke up. The words, "The man in the moon has woken up" echoed in my head. On the wall of my bedroom, a sliver of moon's eerie silver light snuck in through a small gap in my curtains. That night, the moon looked massive and I could clearly see into the cow fields that're usually bathed in an unyielding darkness and felt the all too familiar feeling of being watched whenever I was in the moon's light.
