Hello everyone. I just want to thank you all for being so understanding of my situation, and offering ideas of what may be the cause of Laura’s condition.

I also want to apologise for the late response. Things have happened and I’ve tried to process them as well I can.

I think it would be best if I addressed some of these issues before I report on what happened when I saw Laura again.

Firstly, the idea of her having schizophrenia has been discussed quite often. I understand how this is a valid point but there is one issue with this. No one from her biological family has ever been diagnosed with it. Her father hasn’t and neither did her mother.

Another thing I must address is Laura’s biological mother.

Some of you have asked where she is and whether she’s involved in our lives. Unfortunately, she passed away when Laura was a child. It’s a touchy subject. Whenever I asked my step-father how she died, he always became distressed and shut down. Apparently it was a few months after Laura was born.

Finally, some people have asked whether she had some kind of traumatic experience which may have triggered this behaviour. Now, from my experience with her, I can’t remember a time when something terrible happened to her, apart from her mother’s death. From what I know, Laura didn’t have any bullies and was relatively popular at school. She also didn’t really date anyone either, so I’m putting that theory off to the side for the moment.

I’m keeping all your thoughts in mind, but after the last couple of days I’ve had, I don’t know what to think anymore.

I’ll begin with my visit to see Laura in the hospital.

My husband and I went to see her a few days ago. I shall be calling my husband “Daniel” for the rest of this post, as if I’m honest, continuously calling him ‘my husband’ will start to become tedious for both you and me. He is also not an object.

Daniel drove us there. We sat mostly in silence, each of us away in our own thoughts. I kept thinking about what I’d say, what I’d ask her. I have no idea what Daniel thought, but he kept his eyes firmly on the road and hands tight on the steering wheel.

When we arrived and parked up at the hospital, he turned to me. “You feeling okay?” He asked me gently.

“Yeah,” I nodded and sighed, “I just can’t believe this actually happening y’know?”

He smiled warmly and held my hand, stroking my thumb with his own. “I know,” he spoke, “but this is your chance to talk to her, Liz.”

I nodded again and looked at the entrance of the hospital. Laura was in there somewhere, strapped to a bed and pumped full of vitamins. It was a sickening thought.

“Aren’t you nervous?” I cocked my head. Daniel wasn’t on Laura’s ‘favourite people list’, and I doubted she would be thrilled to see him.

His face twitched. Definitely conflicted.

“Well yeah,” he stretched back on the headrest, “but you can’t go in on your own, I won’t let you.”

I leaned my head on his shoulder and nuzzled into it. He could’ve left me back when all this stuff first happened, but he didn’t. He was my rock throughout our relationship, and he still is. I don’t know I’d do without him.

We eventually made it out the car and to reception, where a police officer guided us to her room. My heart hammered when we reached her door. It was like it wanted to run away and go back home.

The officer told us that he would be outside and that if we needed to get out of there, just holler.

I think I stood there for about five minutes before Daniel willed me to move. He reminded me who Laura was: she was my little sister. It clicked in me that he was right. This was Laura. The girl I grew up with, the girl I took to every hockey game, and the girl I loved with my entire heart and more.

We thanked the officer and, with our hands interlinked, Daniel and I opened the door.

I let out a sob when I saw her.

I thought she’d look different. I thought that I wouldn’t recognise her.

But no.

That was Laura.

She had an arm strapped to the bed with a pair of cuffs. Like she was going somewhere.

She looked almost identical from when I last saw her. She had hollow cheeks and those horrible pink scratches on her face, but it was her.

She was asleep, her eyelids were red-raw and it was clear the nurses had cleaned them recently. I saw her breathing. The gentle raising of her chest and the sound of weak breaths escaped from her split lips. There were cuts all over them. They were so ripped and *dry*.

I had never seen her this frail. Once a college athlete, now she looked like a skeleton. Her body was paper-thin and terribly pale, whether that was from malnutrition or the fact she’d been hiding from the sun all these years.

“Laura?” I whispered, almost dreading what she would be like.

No response.

“Laura,” I called again, “it’s Liz.”

She mumbled something, before slowly opening her eyes and turning to me. Those eyes were bloodshot and so tired. It was almost a struggle to keep them open.

Then she spoke to me for the first time in years.

“Liz?”

I choked back a cry, nodding quickly.

Her lips stretched into a wide grin, teeth stained still stained a wine colour at the corners.

“Liz,” she rasped out, vocal cords torn, “you’re here.”

I let out a wet laugh before wrapping my arms around her in rib-crushing hug. Tears flowed and I shook with joy. Laura held me too, a wobbling arm attempted to reach around me. The hug lasted forever, and I didn’t want it to end. This was my Laura hugging back, I know it was. This was her.

We held each other. I bawled like a child and I felt her tears soak into my t-shirt as she silently cried with me. It was as if everything she did melted away in that one moment, and all that was left was us.

I missed her so much.

I pulled back and held her face, “I can’t believe you’re here.”

“Always.” She let out a throaty giggle before she turned away from my grasp and coughed hard into her elbow.

I grabbed the water from the side table and let her sip from the straw. When she was done, I put the water off to the side and took a seat on the side of the bed.

I bit the inside of my cheek as she stared at me with weary eyes. She still liked to stare.

“Where have you been, Laura?” I held her hand. Her bony fingers barely responded to mine.

She faced away and looked out the window on her right side. I saw her squint at the light of the morning and close them with a hiss.

“Laura?” I squeezed her hand gently to get her attention.

She continued to face the window. It didn’t seem like she wanted to talk about that. At least not yet.

I changed topic, hoping that I hadn’t ruined our reunion just yet. “How have you been?”

She opened her eyes again and faced me, “tired.”

My lips pulled back into a grimace.

I stroked her hair and pressed a kiss to her scalp. “Well you can sleep all you want,” I laughed softly, “you’re safe now.”

She mumbled in agreement before asking for more water. She had almost finished her cup when Daniel spoke, “you want me to get that filled up?”

“*Jesus!*” I jumped and so did Laura.

We both clutched our chests and gawped at the man. I had totally forgotten he had came in with me.

“Sorry, babe,” I apologised, my breath attempting to return, “that would be great, thank you.”

He gave a meek nod and I passed him the cup.

“It’s you.” Laura’s voice rang out behind me.

My husband stopped dead. His eyes were skittish, quickly bouncing between myself and Laura.

“You’re still here.” Laura murmured, voice low.

My heart started to beat just that bit faster. The threat she made to Daniel all those years ago swirled in my mind. “I’ll kill him for you.”

I cautiously turned to Laura, who was staring daggers straight into Daniel. Her eyes were the widest I had seen them since we came in. There was a wildness to them which was held back by some controlling force.

We all sat in silence, unease permeated the air.

Then, much to our surprise, Laura reached her free arm out and extended her hand. Daniel gaped at it and with trembling fingers, gave it a little shake. Her eyes softened around the edges, but I could still see something lurking in those blown-out pupils.

“Nice to see you again, Daniel.” Her lips were stretched into a thin-lipped smile.

Daniel let out an exhale which grew into a laugh. He quickly shushed his laughter before excusing himself to go get some more water.

I was shocked to say the least. Was this some kind of fake niceness before she pulled out the knife?

I studied her, watching how she licked her cracked lips. Her eyes watched my own with a curious interest.

“What?”

I leaned on the bed closer to Laura. “I’m just confused.”

“About?”

“You wanted to kill him, Laura.”

Her eyes flickered again, something unnerving danced behind those lenses.

“That was back then,” she spoke muted and heavy, “I never meant it.”

She didn’t even try to deny it.

I paused and wanted to ask more about where this change came from, but my gut told me to stay quiet. Even though she was strapped to the bed, I could envision her jumping up in bed and clawing at my face. I felt that past fear again. The fear I experienced when I saw her in the bathroom all those years ago.

*Shut up*.

Instead, I forced a smile and faced the window. It was bright outside. We were on the bottom floor and I could see various patients with their families returning to their cars.

“I waited so long, Liz.” Laura broke the dense silence.

“What?” I faced her again.

“Why didn’t you find me?”

“Find you?”

She nodded, neck too sickly to fully contribute to the action.

“Laura, where have you been?” I asked her, trepidation slithered around in my stomach.

She paused and pouted her lips. She always did that when she was thinking. Then, she faced me again and gave me a closed smile.

“I thought you were more observant than this, Liz.”

I stood up. More observant?

“Laura,” my voice wavered, “*where have you been?*”

She watched my reaction for any sign of understanding. When I clearly didn’t get where she was coming from, she motioned with her eyes.

They rolled around in their sockets, going around in a circle. They went up, down, left and right. I watched in horror as she smirked at my confusion, and she uttered one single word:

“Everywhere.”

We left shortly after that.

Daniel and I didn’t speak much either. I think we were both stunned over the day’s events.

I saw him watching the old footage I had saved on my laptop. It was the last chunk from Laura’s old room, when she threatened him. He looked so baffled at the prospect of her not attacking him, which I also felt to some degree. I don’t fully believe she’s being honest.

Woefully, the next day was probably worse than the day before.

Even as I’m writing this, I have no idea how this happened, but it did. It fucking *did*.

Daniel and I were both cuddled up on the sofa watching a documentary. It was on the ocean, actually. Daniel loves stuff like that; sea life and aquatic exploration. I’ll never know how, being deathly afraid of the deep blue, but I have a fondness for his obsession with it.

Anyway, the documentary was talking about tiger sharks. Very specific, I know, but it’s just a key part of my memory.

I thought I heard a knock on the door. It was barely a tap, but I swear I heard it. I told Daniel and he checked the front camera on his phone. No one was there.

We shrugged it off as the wind with a smidge of paranoia on my end. After what happened the day before, it was a no brainer.

We continued to watch when I heard a knock again. It was sharper this time. Far more distinct. Daniel heard it this time and was about to go check the door when I stopped him.

“Check the camera first.” I told him.

He sat back down and looked at the camera. Still nothing.

“There was a knock, right?” He asked, continuing to stare at the camera.

“Yeah.” I pouted.

We shook it off. There were so many logical reasons for the knocks. It was an old house; you could hear someone walking downstairs clear as day upstairs. Creaking was also a regular occurrence with the floorboards and everything, so it wasn’t too outlandish that the door was making noise because of its age.

What we couldn’t pin down was what happened next.

There was a knock at the back window.

Firm and clean, three distinct taps. *Tap, tap, tap*.

Daniel shot up in his seat. I was going to pause the documentary when he grabbed my wrist and shook his head. He raised a finger to his lips, and went back onto his camera.

The back camera wasn’t loading. The feed was gone.

He breathed in and whispered in my ear, tickling the shell. “Go upstairs.”

I opened my mouth to retort but he shushed me and pointed to window.

Under the curtain, I could see the backyard sensor light was on, and a black blob was in the middle of the windowsill; someone was standing outside the window.

We made our way quietly upstairs, taking care as we muted the TV and tried to avoid any creaky steps.

We heard the banging again when we reached the top of the stairs. It was more insistent and demanding. The person wanted us to look out the window and their agitation was clear in each rattling knock.

The knocking continued when we got settled upstairs. Daniel placed his office chair under the door knob, locking it. We had called the police and they were on their way. I was shaking in Daniel’s arms, much to my embarrassment. I’m not usually scared of stuff like that, but holy shit. It was awful.

Our room was right above the back living room window, so we would hear it upstairs.

We couldn’t hear any voices, but we heard walking. The person must’ve been barefoot because we couldn’t the feet very well. We had to hold our breaths and lean up against our window to hear anything.

They paced back and forth, seemingly becoming frustrated with us for hiding.

I desperately wanted to see who this was. It sounds horrible, but it came across my mind that it could be Laura. It seemed impossible. She was in hospital, bound to a bed. *She couldn’t be here, could she?*

The thought made my stomach gurgle nastily, I had to walk away from the window and sit on the floor.

Daniel came by my side and wrapped his arm around my shoulder. He faced me and looked at my eyes. “It’s not her.” He whispered before placing a kiss on my cheek.

I think he did that calm me down, but also himself. We knew it was borderline unthinkable for her to even be there, but the feeling still stirred in our guts. We held on to that faux-promise and waited for the police sirens to come.

However, as soon as his lips left my cheek, we heard the worst sound anyone could imagine in that situation.

The sound of glass smashing.

Silence.

Then, the sound of someone walking downstairs.

We shot our heads to the door, neither of us daring to move.

Whoever was banging on our window had now managed to get in and was now staggering around drunkenly in our hallway.

Their walking was wobbly and disjointed. I closed my eyes and imagined a person shambling around the bottom floor of the house, like a dog on its hind legs trying to walk.

It was so *odd*.

We heard the creaks of every floorboard, as they went from one room to the next. Heavy footsteps punctuated every squeak.

They were searching for us.

I kept thinking about the police. *Where were they and why were they taking so long?*

Shortly after this thought, the creaks stopped.

The silence was deafening. I held a hand over my mouth and nose as I attempted to hide my breath.

The entirety of the bottom floor was quiet and noiseless.

It almost disturbed me more that there was no sound, rather than hearing that wretched shuffling.

I trembled where I sat, teeth chattering against each other. Daniel didn’t look away from the door, and alternatively, he had moved from a seated position to crouch, leaning away from the door.

He squat-walked over to the side of his bed, where he gingerly poked around for his baseball bat. He always kept one under the bed.

He found the bat and lifted it slowly from the floor. Then, he waddled back over to me and held the bat in front of him, before he spun his head back and breathed, “I’m going down.”

Daniel turned and started to steadily rise to a standing position. Before he could stand up, I snatched his shoulder and yanked it back. He looked at me with an addled expression before the next round of woody groans echoed through the house.

The person downstairs was now making their way up the stairs.

We froze.

They were walking at a fragmented pace, each clumsy foot stomping against the wood steps. The intruder tripped on one of the bottom steps and we heard them land on the deck with both feet. They then continued their stringed out journey up the stairs.

It reminded me of a child walking up the steps for the first time. One foot on the step, then the other. Once both feet were on the step, they’d move onto the next.

It was achingly slow.

Daniel had stood up now, baseball bat clenched in his fists. I squeezed myself in the corner of our room, next to the wardrobe.

I didn’t want Daniel to go out there. I couldn’t let him.

Daniel kept on looking back at me, giving me nods to check to see if I was okay.

I nodded back. I wasn’t okay, though. I was terrified.

Eventually, the intruder made their way to the top of the steps and stopped. I could hear them letting out wet breaths, saliva gargled around in their throat.

My heart plummeted when I heard a filthy, hiccuping sound. It was a high-pitched laugh, or at least an attempt of one. It was so foreign and unnatural I had to cup my hands over my ears in disgust.

If this was who I thought it was, I was going to be fucking sick.

It sounded like *her.*

I saw Daniel brace himself as he heard something from outside the door.

I meekly removed my hands from my ears and heard the breathing clearer now. It was grating and akin to a rattle in someone’s chest.

They stood there wheezing loudly.

Neither Daniel or I shifted. The air was thick and foreboding as we stared at the door.

I imagined her.

She had jumped out the hospital window and made a dash for the house. I thought about how she must’ve waited so long until the cover of darkness, then she decided to make her move.

*Did she plan it out?*

A gentle “*thunk, thunk*” sound ripped me from my horrid imagination. They placed their palms on the door.

Their fingers drummed against the wood, miniature taps incessantly thudding in an impatient pattern.

I stared at the door’s knob, begging for it to stay untouched.

Unfortunately, this request was not heard by the intruder, as the door knob to our room began to slowly twist. They took their time, the knob turning gradually like a car wheel.

It turned down to the bottom, and they held it there. Then, they pushed.

Luckily, the office door blocked the door from opening, as the handle scraped the leather of the back part of the seat.

They couldn’t get in.

The door knob turned little by little before it reached its regular position.

Daniel and I both took a sigh of relief.

The intruder must’ve realised that we locked the door, because their calm disturbance became hostile.

They ragged aggressively at the knob, the office chair rocking roughly against the door. They let out a quiet grunt of frustration and the sound of the door banging against the chair grew louder and louder.

I heard them throw their weight against the wood, smashing their body into the door in an attempt to bring it down.

They *needed* to get in.

I inched up the wall, eyes fixated on the door and the furious figure behind it.

Daniel walked backwards until he was directly in front of me. His hands were shaking slightly but he maintained his defensive stance and continued to shield me.

“If anything happens, you fucking run.” He told me with a hushed tone.

I stood there speechless. How had it come to this?

Just as I was preparing to say, “*I love you*”, in the distance, I heard a sound.

Something loud and whining. A sound I don’t think I would ever be happy hearing.

The high-pitched scream of police sirens rang in my ears.

The tears already pricked at my eyes as I held my husband from behind, burying my head into his back.

Fucking finally.

The attack on the door had ceased at once, with the knob back to normal.

They knew their time was up.

So, the intruder scurried across the landing and shot downstairs, floorboards squeaking terribly under the weight.

We heard them thundering along the downstairs hallway before the police sirens blocked out any noise.

When the police arrived they sat us both down in our bedroom and searched the house top to bottom. It was agony sitting there, waiting.

I don’t know if I felt alleviated or distraught when they told us the person had disappeared.

There was no one inside the house, outside the house or anywhere near us.

They had simply ceased to exist.

The house was the same as it was when we moved upstairs, apart from that all the doors downstairs were wide open and the window at the back of the living room was smashed.

There was glass all over the carpet.

The officers at our house contacted the others that were stationed outside Laura’s room.

We waited. The crisp crackles from the radio went dead for a moment. A couple of seconds that lasted years. Everyone waited in bated breath to hear the response.

A roar came from the little black box on the officer’s chest.

The other officer on the radio spoke quietly and caused the man in front of us to furrow his brow.

He thanked the officer on the radio and rubbed his forehead, dark eyes flickering from one of us to the next.

Then, he let us know what they found.

My jaw hit the floor when they told us what the officers at the hospital saw.

“What the fuck do you mean, *‘she’s in bed?’*”

Daniel had stood up now, face now white.

“Sir, I’m just letting you know what they’re seeing.”

Daniel brought his hands up to the back of his head, craning his neck up to the sky in disbelief. He shook his head with an exhausted laugh.

“Look, the window’s still locked and her restraint is still tied.” The officer held his hands up in defence.

I rose to my feet and placed a hand on Daniel’s back. My mouth was dry but I felt sweat well up on my brow. I was going to be sick.

Before I could process it, my stomach lurched and bile raced up my throat. I pushed past the officers and ran to the kitchen, clutching my mouth.

I vomited into the kitchen sink, saliva and acid dripped from my lips.

Soon after, a hot hand patted my back.

“Easy, Liz.” Daniel’s voice cooed behind me, trying to soothe my nerves.

He pressed a kiss to my upper back and huffed.

My head couldn’t stop buzzing. *How?* I couldn’t wrap my mind around how she could’ve done it. It had to have been her. That laugh, those noises. It was her.

“We’d recommend you two stay the night at the station.” The officer had walked in after Daniel. “You’ll be safe there.”

I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand, tired of the whole situation.

“*You think?*” I snapped, or tried to. My mouth was still full of viscous spit.

“Babe.”Daniel looked at me with his eyebrows knitted together and lips pouty.

I pinched the bridge of my nose and groaned. The police were just as clueless as we were.

“God, I’m so sorry.” I faced the officer with sleepy eyes.

The officer nodded, “it’s fine, honestly,” he put his hands in his pockets awkwardly, “just grab any essentials and you can ride with me.”

We thanked him and headed upstairs to get our phones. The pair of us collected the appliances wordlessly, walking past each other to grab whatever we needed for the night.

We rode with that officer to the station. The ride was dull.

“It was her, y’know.” I mumbled, my eyes watching the rear-view mirror. The officer had eyes like my sister; big and blue. It made me feel ill.

The officer peered back, “you think?”

“I know it was,” I sat up in the backseat, “I recognised her voice.”

Silence returned to the car.

“Everything alright, sir?”

Daniel didn’t react and focussed on the window.

“Sir?” The officer called again.

“Dan?” I reached a hand out and stroked his shoulder.

He stayed still. Then, he inhaled, exhaled and spoke.

“I can’t stop thinking about it.”

I rose a brow and stopped rubbing his shoulder. “What?”

He paused and turned to stare at the headrest of the seat in front of him.

“She told me *‘it was nice to see me again.’*”

An intense hush filled the truck.

I thought about that morning.

She shook his hand and told him that. She looked him dead in the eye and confessed. She did the same to me too.

*“I can’t believe you’re here.”*

*“Always.”*

*“Where have you been, Laura?”*

*“Everywhere.”*

What the fuck.

Where? How? When? There’s so many questions.

She was there.

Looking back, she could’ve been at my wedding. My fucking wedding.

We haven’t stayed at home since. If this was Laura’s doing, then it wouldn’t be safe staying there for the foreseeable future.

Thankfully, Abbie’s allowed us to stay at her place.

Abbie and I had grown so much closer since Laura vanished. We go out together often and I chose her to be the Maid of Honour at my wedding. It was like she took Laura’s place, in some kind of twisted and cursed way.

She couldn’t look after me as a child, but now she could. I think guilt made her take me in. All that missed time and the hapless shit that happened to me must’ve played on her conscience.

Only one of her kids live here now, so there’s a bedroom and en-suite free for us to use.

I couldn’t fathom how this situation went downhill this much.

I haven’t been to see Laura. According to the hospital, she’s about to go through a psychological assessment.

Fuck knows what’ll happen there.

I can’t prove who broke into my house was her. I simply can’t. From an outsider’s point of view, it’s impossible.

But I know. That laugh was disturbingly familiar and I could hear her. Beneath all those vile gurgles, it was Laura.

Even though I have a warm bed and a protected roof over my head, I can’t sleep.

Not now.

Daniel tries to help me sleep, but I know he struggles too. He tosses and turns most of the night.

How could we sleep? We can’t.

I think that’s why I keep seeing her.

It’s certainly sleep deprivation. I know it is.

But she’s everywhere, just like she told me.

I see her on the way to and from work, when I go shopping, hell, sometimes I see her at night across the street.

I saw her on the way to work this morning. She was standing under a streetlight, face blank and eyes pulsating.

She was dressed in the medical robe and kept on flexing her fingers, almost like she was stretching them for use.

Her eyes were rosy, blooming with blood. Those long blonde locks were knotted and streaked with grease.

The worst part was her mouth. It was thin and pink with dried blood.

I saw black lines peek out of her lips. They decorated the two pieces of flesh like pen lines. I think it was hair.

I looked at her once, blinked and looked again.

Gone.

I swear she’s making me go crazy. I can’t be crazy. I can’t.

Every time her she looked wrong.

Eyes too small, then too big. Nose too long, then too short. Lips too wide, then too slim.

She was always wrong.

The only thing consistent with her appearance was the hair that streaked her lips. It got longer and longer, dangling out of her maw.

In the later visions, the inky hair would reach her chin and then sneak past her chest.

When I came home today, I saw her in the backyard.

Except this time, it felt real.

She was wobbling there on the grass, jaw hung open and jet-black strands acted like drool, swinging in the wind.

I stared at her from the kitchen window.

She stared back, teary eyes leaking.

The night she tried to beat me to death came to mind.

I didn’t look away this time, though.

After what seemed like forever, she began to move.

She sluggishly reached a hand up to her mouth, fingers trapped in a claw.

When her hand made it to her lips, she stopped and waited.

My eyes started to water, desperate to shut themselves.

Suddenly, she shoved her hand down her throat. It was a replica of what she did years earlier on that camera.

Her red eyes spun upward in her head, and she threw her head back. Her hand was deep in there, mouth engulfed by her wrist and forearm.

I watched as she retracted her hand and pulled out a huge clump of black hair, covered in bile.

The strands wiggled around her fingers like raven tentacles, as if they were scared to be seen out in the open.

Her eyes fell on me again. I shuddered as her pupils swelled and overtook her irises.

I couldn’t watch anymore.

I closed my eyes and shook my head. Tears filled my eyes and I wiped them away with the sleeves of my blazer.

My eyelids fluttered and I faced the floor, overwhelmed.

My eyes were fucked.

I opened them and blinked madly, trying to get over the constant stream of tears.

My head fell forward onto the sink’s edge and I took in a lungful of air. I needed to calm down. This wasn’t real. I was tired.

I inhaled one last time and raised my head inch by inch to face the window.

Then I screamed so hard my throat still hurts now.

Laura’s face was pressed up against the window, hair-laced drool and tears smeared the glass.

Her decrepit fingers were spread wide as she placed them next her face. The hand she used to get the hair out of throat was soaked in spit and small curls were dotted under the nails like worms.

I saw the blue and purple veins streaming through her pasty skin, pulsing with adrenaline.

If she pushed herself any further into the window, she would’ve broken her nose.

She smiled at my fear and let out a whine, like a baby seeing their parent after playing peek-a-boo. Her shiny teeth touched the glass with a light clink.

Once I stopped screaming, her grin dropped and morphed into a look of concern. Her eyes scanned my complexion and her eyebrows lowered.

I closed my eyes and started gulping breaths. This wasn’t real. It wasn’t real.

Laura tapped on the window, aiming to get my attention.

I ignored her. It had to be a trick.

She knocked again, softer this time.

I still ignored her.

After this blatant disregard, the taps stopped.

It was silent once again.

This, too, could’ve been a trick. She could’ve stopped in order to get me to look.

However, I took a gamble and decided to open my eyes.

I had to look eventually, so why prolong my terror any longer?

As I opened my eyes, I prepared to see Laura’s stretched face still plastered on the glass.

Thankfully, Laura had gone.

I leaned back onto the kitchen table and exhaled. It wasn’t real.

I thought that until I returned my gaze to the window.

With a gasp, I staggered backwards, hitting my legs into the table ledge.

There, in two separate tracks, saliva and mucus dribbled down the window. I saw wavy black hair flecked in the liquid, as they slipped down the glass at a leisurely pace. Another pair of tracks were above the bottom ones; Laura’s tears.

I squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head.

I refused to believe this was real.

My eyes opened again. The disgusting display was still evident, posing as a macabre painting of reality.

I spotted something lying on the grass.

It was dark and messy, thin wisps waggled in the air as to wave me over to come have a look.

I knew what it was.

The bundle of hair Laura yanked out of her mouth was wafting in the wind, soggy strands made a congealed mass.

I found the courage to slink outside and check the place out. Silly idea, I know. But I saw something. Not just Laura. There was something in the hair, something yellow.

I reached the clump and ogled at it.

It was a giant hairball.

I crouched down and prodded at it. The hair was so thick and squishy, it felt like wiry slime.

Hidden in that black mush was a yellow leaf.

I thought it was paper, but the more I dug, the more it presented as an ochre-coloured leaf.

It had been rolled like a cigarette and it unfurled when I pulled it out of the gross thicket.

There were some marks on it.

I called Daniel and he came home right away.

He asked what happened. I told him everything, voice cracking every so often. He listened intently and nodded occasionally.

We decided to tell Abbie and her partner what happened. They obviously lost their shit and called the police.

That leads me to now.

I’m currently sat in the upstairs bathroom, typing all this out.

The police are downstairs chatting to Abbie. Daniel’s in bed, finally asleep after all this time. Bless him. I never wanted anyone else to get involved in this. Ever.

The police are patrolling the house tonight. They’ll be outside, watching it for any intruders, most notably Laura.

Speaking of Laura, when we asked where she was at the time of her reappearance, the police told us she didn’t have a an officer watching her at that time. They went to the toilet or some bullshit like that.

This is getting ridiculous now.

She knows where we live, and if she knows that, she’ll know about Abbie.

Maybe she knew about her from the wedding.

All I actually know is this. If she knows about Abbie, there’s a big chance my big sister’s in trouble.

I keep thinking this is all my fault.

If I hadn’t seen her that day at the hospital, maybe we wouldn’t be here.

If I hadn’t stayed out that week with Daniel all those years ago, maybe we wouldn’t be here.

If I hadn’t offered for her to stay with me when she went to college, maybe we wouldn’t be here.

I hid the leaf from them. It was selfish. I know. But I don’t think the police will take this seriously, as let’s be honest, they didn’t even care enough to keep *one* officer in her damn room. I want to fix this, and I need to.

The leaf had marks on it, yes. They weren’t random doodles, but writing.

Scratched on the leaf in splotchy deep red liquid, was the phrase:

“*He hides the truth.*”

It was so random. I kept picking at my brain to find out who she was alluding to.

It could’ve been anyone. Daniel, Abbie’s partner, even the officer we rode with.

My step-father?

Who knows.

I look at it and I can’t think.

If anything I shouldn’t be thinking. I should be sleeping.

Now there’s surveillance on the house, I think it’s about time I get to bed.

I need my strength for tomorrow.

Questions need to be asked, and I intend to find answers.

I have a chance to right my wrongs, and if that means I interrogate every man I know, so be it.
