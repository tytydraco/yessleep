I moved into my new apartment back in August. I felt like it was a good way of mixing things up as I lived in a college dormitory the previous year, and needless to say, it wasn’t fun. My dorm was my personalized prison. When I wasn’t in class, I was in my dorm. It didn’t help that there was simply nothing for me outside of school. Partying didn’t interest me and the clubs on campus were lousy. It’s not like I made any friends on campus either as I couldn’t relate to anyone, and when I tried, it always failed. 
  

  
This new semester was an opportunity to make changes. Being a recluse only got you so far in life, so I linked up with a friend of mine from high school, and he agreed to be my roommate. I wasn’t the closest to him back then, and I’m shocked he even wanted to live with me. He claimed that moving to a college town would be a great place to find decent jobs and perhaps a lady friend. There’s a reason I wasn’t close to him after all, and unfortunately, the womanizer was the only one to take me up on my offer. 
  

  
Shortly after signing the leases with Jake, move-in day arrived. I packed up my things neatly in boxes, and everything on my end was a breeze; It’s not like I had much to my name anyways. Jake, on the other hand, was a different story. He clumsily loaded everything into the back of his shoddy pickup truck, including furniture, the worst of which was a massive dresser; Hauling that dresser up the stairs nearly killed me. 
  

  
Nevertheless, Jake and I settled in well the first few days. I bought some decor and tried to make the place feel like home. Jake wasn’t much help in that department; he couldn’t give less of a shit what the apartment looked like. He was always off working at his new job, the pizzeria, or perusing uptown for a lady. As for me, classes and the occasional odd job occupied my time in the mornings. Afternoons and nights were my time to hold down the fort, and I’d spend my time doing chores or watching TV. In all honesty, I threw my spare time away, but it led to the most dreadful discovery.
  

  
Roughly a month after I had moved in, the side closet downstairs became a breeding ground for the unexplainable.  Jake and I only used it as a storage room, and we only used it the day we moved in. I’m certain Jake hadn’t been in the side closet since he first threw half of his belongings in there. Would’ve saved us some trouble if he hadn’t brought so much junk. 


  
Despite never going into the closet, I began to hear strange noises from the other side. The first time it happened, I was walking down the hallway towards the laundry room to wash my clothes. The scrape and churn of machinery echoed from inside the closet, and the moment it filled my ears, my legs locked and breaths stopped. I slowly dropped my clothes on the floor, turned the knob, and swung the door open. I peered into the ill-lit room, but nothing was out of the ordinary. The dim room only stored a few boxes and trinkets, none of which were tampered. I stood in place—dumbfounded—swearing that there was something making those noises. After processing the strange occurrence, I left to finish my laundry and by the time everything was clean, Jake came home. 
  

  
“Hey man,” Jake said, stumbling into the living room. 
  

  
“What’s up?” 
  

  
Jake made his way over to me in the kitchen, running into the wall a few times and finally gained some stability when he got to the counter. His breath reeked of alcohol and my nose was burdened with body odor. 
  

  
“Sam, I am so gone right now.” He slurred his words.
  

  
“Really? Couldn’t tell.” 
  

  
Jake ignored my slight and chuckled. “Yeah man, had a crazy night.” After our productive conversation, he swirled around and stumbled back to the living room. As he waddled up the stairs to his bedroom, I remembered the noises. 
  

  
“Jake,” I called out.
  

  
“What?” He could barely keep his balance on the stairs, stepping back and forth as if he was dancing. 
  

  
“When you’re home, have you noticed anything about the closet?”
  

  
Jake placed his hand on his lips and thought for a moment. “Uh - no.” 
  

  
He really had a way with words.
  

  
“I heard something earlier today, sounded like something falling over. I checked, but everything seemed fine.”
  

  
Jake hung against the railing of the stairs, his mouth gaped open. “Weird,” he said. “It was probably nothing.”
  

  
“Thanks, Jake.” He was as helpful as I thought he would be. 
  

  
He stumbled up the stairs, and I was left alone. I was burdened with the question, and left with no answers. The rattle continued to echo from the closet, and at some point it began to ring out multiple times a day. My fears were subdued as the noises didn’t scare me anymore, and in reality, the sounds actually started to bother me more than anything. I reached out to my landlord, hoping that he had a solution. He came by the apartment the following day, and I opened my front door to see him towering over me like a giant. Joel was bulky, and his frame almost made it impossible to fit through the doorway. 
  

  
“What’s the issue,” Joel grumbled.
  

  
“There are these banging noises that keep coming from my closet. I can’t relax when I’m home.”
  

  
Joel scratched at the nape of his neck, and his lips tightened. “Your neighbors mentioned it too.” He paused to find his words and began to run his hand through his thin hair repeatedly. “But I wouldn’t worry about it, kid. We’ve already put in a ticket for maintenance.” 
  

  
“Oh. Well, thanks for letting me know.”
  

  
“Mhm.” Joel stopped combing his fingers through his delicate strands of graying hair. “Just don’t worry about it.” With that he walked off in a hurry, and his reaction transformed my annoyance into curiosity. That night, when Jake got home from work, I decided to let him in on my plan. He came through the door, thankfully sober, and before he retreated to his bedroom I called out his name.
  

  
“What is it?” Jake said.
  

  
“I want you to help me figure out the closet issue.”
  

  
He threw his keys down on the coffee table. “Why are you so hung up on that?” Jake said, walking over to the closet door, and opened it. “There’s nothing in there.” 
  

  
I sighed. “Look, I know you don’t care. But could you just do me a solid?”
  

  
Jake mulled over what I said. His face wrinkled, and he rubbed his scraggly beard with two fingers. “What do I get?” He licked his thin lips and rubbed his hands together. 
  

  
“What do you want?” 
  

  
“I don’t know yet, but you owe me. Whatever I need - you got to do it.”
  

  
I pinched the bridge of my nose. “Fine. Just don’t ask for anything weird.”
  

  
Jake chuckled. “Sounds like a deal.” 
  

  
I moved the boxes out of the dingy closet while he stood outside the door frame. Jake fortunately brought a flashlight with him. His junk actually had a use this time as the only light fixture in the room was dim. I asked to use it, but he refused, creating some stupid excuse just so I wouldn’t have to touch his stuff. I brushed it off and let Jake shine the flashlight in any place that harbored my suspicions.  
  

  
“You already looked over there!” Jake said.
  

  
“I’m just double checking. I don’t want to miss anything.” His growing impatience frustrated me. “If you don’t want me to tell you where to look, then look around yourself.” 
  

  
Jake rolled his eyes. “What if I just leave?”
  

  
“Come on, don’t do that.”
  

  
He turned off the flashlight and started to walk away.
  

  
“If you help me, I’ll pay next month’s rent! I promise.” 
  

  
My bargain stopped him in his tracks. “Damn. You’ll do that?” Jake said, his voice becoming an octave higher. 
  

  
“Yeah, I’ll do it. I swear.” 
  

  
Jake came back and stood beneath the doorway. “You’re either crazy or an idiot.” he scoffed. “Do you even have the money for that?”
  

  
He had a point. I don’t know where I’d come up with the cash, but at that moment I wasn’t worried about details. “I just want the noises to stop.” 
  

  
A smirk grew on his blocky face. “Alright, it’s a deal.”
  

  
“Good. Come over here and check out this spot.” 
  

  
Jake walked into the closet, and as he stepped closer to me, the floor beneath our feet caved in. My balance was thrown off, and I fell straight to the ground. Jake on the other hand caught himself by stretching his arm out to the wall, keeping him upright. 
  

  
He gestured at the ground. “Great job. Now the floor is broken. You *are* just an idiot.” Jake quipped. 
  

  
I glared at him with narrow eyes and picked myself up from the ground. Before I could gather my thoughts, a foul odor began to seep from the broken floor boards. The rotten stench pierced our noses, and we gagged. Jake was repulsed by it more than I was; Vomit filled his mouth, which he promptly swallowed back down.
  

  
“What is that?” He asked among his spells of dry heaving.
  

  
“I don't know but please light a candle or something!”
  

  
Jake and I hurried out of the closet. We gathered what we could and sprayed down the room with every kind of fragrance and disinfectant. For extra measure, we even put on these blue face masks. It was as if the closet became a lock-down zone, but nevertheless, the smell subsided enough for us to continue our search while still lingering in the air. 
  

  
“Dammit, Sam. Whatever's going on here better be worth it.” 
  

  
I nodded. “I promise I’ll pay you back.”
  

  
Jake grunted and took hold of the flashlight as we continued to study the room. The floor where we once stood was fragile and the nails that held it down were bent and twisted. I slid my fingers between the cracks and pulled up as hard as I could. The board snapped in half with ease and revealed what was hidden underneath. Jake’s flashlight illuminated a narrow, dirt corridor. Without hesitation, I broke a few more floor boards and jumped into the hole. 
  

  
“Are you nuts?!” Jake exclaimed. “I don’t want to go down there!”
  

  
“You can stay up there, but hand me the flashlight.” 
  

  
He glanced down at his flashlight and back at me. “Don’t lose it.” 
  

  
“Yeah man, I got it.” I rolled my eyes at him. 
  

  
Jake reluctantly passed the flashlight to me, and I pointed it toward one end of the corridor, then the other. The light wasn’t strong enough as there was no end in sight, only darkness. A wave of dread struck me and the fear settled in my chest. I tried to shake it away best I could, but I felt my optimism dwindle. I took in a sharp breath, picked a direction, and walked slowly.
  
 
  
It wasn’t long until a split appeared in the corridor. I chose a path and soon after, another division came into view, this time a three-way intersection. I continued ahead and repeatedly ran into turns, breakaways, and branching tunnels. The reality of the situation dawned on me; I found myself in a labyrinth.
  

  
The dirt that carpeted this labyrinth squished with every step. Muddy water would crawl out the earth and bleed into my shoes, soaking my socks. The discomfort from the ground was no match for the atmosphere, as the further I traversed the thicker the air became. The putrid smell also grew stronger, and my eyes watered. I couldn’t bear it anymore and turned around, following the tracks I had left in the dirt. 
  

  
I didn’t make it far until I stopped. The silence of the corridor was broken, as the metallic clashing and clanging was faint but grew louder with every second that passed by. I braced myself and rushed down the corridor, chasing the noise until it became louder with every step I took. I knew I was on the right track, so close to finding out what was causing all of this. Turning and maneuvering around each of the paths, I took one last step as I rounded the last corner. 
  

  
My legs grew stiff, my spine grew rigid, and my breath faltered. It stood a few inches away from me. The figure’s swarthy and gorey skin blanketed bones, and ribs splayed out from its chest. Threads of flesh and membrane held together two wide iron cylinders in the center of its body. As it breathed, the mechanical cylinders rattled and beat together.
  

  
 I screamed at the sight of this monster. It lunged out as I bolted down the corridor. I ran as fast as I could, trying to keep track of the footprints left behind. Sprinting down the labyrinth, the clash and clang of the beast vibrated against the back of my neck, as the rattle of its metal lungs were mere inches behind me. I took one last turn as I saw beams of light raining down from the broken floor. 
  

  
“Jake! Please! Jake!” I yelled. 
  

  
I stood just beneath the hole as the beast barreled toward me. Jake ran over and held out his hand, unaware of the creature's presence. I latched on and he pulled me out. I rose to my feet, quickly backing away from the hole. A mix of confusion and concern covered Jake’s face. It was the first time he’d been so pensive, and I could tell that too many questions were running through his head; He was trying so hard to only pick one. Before Jake could open his lips, to even think about what to say, the beast leaped out and grabbed his leg. He yelled and pleaded for mercy as it pulled him into the corridor. I chose to watch, but the beast forced me to listen. I stood still and heard the crunch of his bones, and the last plea for his life echo from the labyrinth. 

It's been a week now, and I still hear those horrible sounds: the rattle, the screams, the cries. Even if I'm at my parents, miles away, what happened at my apartment and what happened to Jake follows me. The worst part---the most crushing---is that I can't tell anyone. I'm not scared of people not believing me; I'm scared that people will think I'm crazy. The only way I can get out what I think is through the internet. I'll be writing what happens to me and the apartment when I can't sleep. God knows I can't sleep.
