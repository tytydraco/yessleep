 I remember the day I found it as if it were yesterday. The late afternoon sun hung low, casting long shadows across the flea market on the outskirts of our little town.

A dry, hot breeze stirred the dust as I walked through the rows of vendors, scanning for anything useful.

The farm wasn’t doing well this season—pests, birds, and rodents were tearing through the crops.

Clara and I had tried everything—scare tactics, traps, sprays—but nothing seemed to work. The farm was struggling, and so were we. I was desperate, on edge, grasping for anything that might help.

That’s when I saw it.

Tucked between a pile of rusted tools and battered knickknacks was a scarecrow. It was old, worn out, and tattered. The kind of thing that had been through too many summers and winters, far more than it should have survived.

Its burlap face was faded, sun-bleached, and split in places. Straw poked through the ends of its sleeves and trousers, yellowed and brittle. The clothes—a pair of ripped overalls and a threadbare flannel shirt—hung limp from its crooked frame, remnants of an era long forgotten.

And despite its ragged appearance, something about it pulled me in. I couldn’t shake the feeling it was watching me, as if its dark hollow eyes were tracking my every move. And the crooked, stitched smile stretched unnaturally wide, almost up to its ears,

A small, hunched man sat behind the stall, his face shadowed beneath a wide-brimmed hat. I almost turned away—something about him and the scarecrow gave me an uneasy feeling—but then he spoke in a raspy, gravelly voice.

“You’re looking for something to keep the birds away, aren’t you?” he said. His voice was like gravel grinding underfoot. I nodded, unsure how he knew. 

“This here’ll do the trick,” he said, gesturing toward the scarecrow with his bony finger. “No birds, no rodents, no pests. You’ll see.” 

I hesitated. The scarecrow looked like it would fall apart if I so much as touched it. “Does it work?” I asked, my voice filled with scepticism. 

The man grinned, revealing a set of yellowed, uneven teeth. “It works,” he said. “Better than you think. Just set it up in your field. It’ll do the rest.” 

Desperation gnawed at me, and despite the unsettling feeling in my gut, I handed over the little cash I had left. The man took it without another word, and I hauled the scarecrow into the bed of my truck, feeling the weight of its hollow, straw-filled body as it thudded against the metal. 

When I got home, Clara was inside cooking dinner, the kids helping her set the table. The smell of roasting chicken wafted through the air as I carried the scarecrow toward the field.

The crops swayed in the soft evening breeze, rows of corn and wheat stretching out before me. I chose a spot right in the middle—far enough from the house but close enough that I could still watch it from the upstairs window—and attached  the scarecrow to a wooden pole already planted deep in the soil.

It stood crooked and eerie, its burlap face staring blankly at the sky. For a moment, I stood there too, staring back at it, trying to shake off the growing unease that had lingered since the market.

That night, sleep didn’t come easily. I tossed and turned, my mind replaying the image of the scarecrow in the field—motionless, seemingly unthreatening, yet somehow menacing.

Was I expecting some sort of miracle from it? Is that why I felt this knot in my stomach—because deep down, I knew I was acting out of desperation, not thinking rationally?

As I lay in bed, the wind howled outside, rattling the shutters, but beyond that, there was silence. No crows cawing, no rustling in the crops. Just an unsettling, unnatural silence.

When morning came, I stepped outside, half-expecting to find the fields torn apart like before. But they were untouched. Not a single stalk was damaged. I looked toward the scarecrow, still standing in the same spot, and felt a wave of relief.

Maybe the old peddler was right. Maybe it really was that effective. 

A couple more days went by, and the crops remained unharmed. Not a single bird or rodent dared to come near them. For the first time in months, I felt a glimmer of hope.

Clara noticed the shift in my mood and began to believe again herself as she watched our children Emma and Luke play among the crops, their laughter ringing through the air.

But on the fourth night, things took a strange turn. I woke up in the middle of the night, my throat dry and aching for a glass of water. After downing it, I happened to glance out the window toward the field—and froze. The scarecrow wasn’t where I had left it.

I rubbed my eyes, thinking I must be mistaken. But no—there it was, at the far end of the field, in a spot where I had never placed it. My heart raced. Had someone moved it? Was it a prank? My mind scrambled for answers, but none made sense. I told myself it didn’t matter and went back to bed.

But the next day early morning, I found something even more disturbing.

Scattered among the crops were dead animals—birds, rodents, frogs, and other small creatures. Their bodies lay arranged in peculiar, almost ritualistic patterns, surrounded by pieces of straw—the kind that felt all too familiar.

At first, I thought it was some predator playing tricks, maybe a wild animal. But deep down, a cold knot formed in my stomach. I couldn’t ignore the fact that it started happening the moment I brought that scarecrow home. 

I tried to brush it off, to focus on the positive. The crops were thriving. My family was doing well. But each night, as the wind howled through the trees, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching us. Something that wasn’t just straw and old cloth. 

Determined to put my fears to rest, I decided to keep watch over the field myself, alone, in the dead of night.

Once everyone had gone to bed, I grabbed my shotgun and went upstairs to the second floor, where I could see the entire field from the window. I sat down, keeping vigil. But after a couple of hours of waiting, exhaustion crept in, and I started to drift off.

When I opened my eyes a little while later, I instinctively glanced outside, expecting to see the familiar silhouette of the scarecrow standing in its usual spot.

But it wasn’t there.

My heart leapt into my throat as I scanned the field, and then I saw it—moving. The scarecrow was moving.

Not walking exactly, but almost drifting, as if something unseen was dragging it across the ground. It stopped at the far end of the field, and to my horror, I saw the birds descend quietly around it.

I bolted out of my chair, grabbed my shotgun, and rushed downstairs.

I didn’t wake Clara or the kids—I didn’t want to scare them. But my pulse pounded in my ears as I sprinted into the field, lantern swinging wildly in my other arm.

When I reached the spot, I nearly dropped it.

Dead animals were scattered everywhere—birds, mice, even a rabbit—arranged in eerie, precise circles. Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted it again: the scarecrow, drifting slowly toward the far end of the field.

I ran toward it, gripping my shotgun tightly as the lantern swayed in my hand and the wind howled around me. But as I approached the scarecrow, I froze.

It wasn’t the scarecrow that terrified me.

It was Emma—my 12-year-old daughter—carrying the scarecrow as if it weighed nothing. The pole rested effortlessly on her small shoulder, her hands gripping it firmly yet without emotion.

Her movements were slow and mechanical, her eyes wide and blank, as if she were trapped in a trance.

Behind her, my 8-year-old son, Luke, knelt on the ground, his small hands stained with blood. He was carefully arranging a sparrow’s body among the others, his face blank, his eyes unblinking. With a firm grip, he squeezed another rat’s neck until it went limp, then placed it on the ground, completing a circle of dead animals.

A wave of dread rose in my chest as I choked out a call, my voice thick with fear. "Emma! Luke! What are you doing?!"

They didn’t respond. They didn’t even flinch. Emma kept walking, gripping the pole attached to the scarecrow and moving forward. Luke silently followed behind her.

Then Emma suddenly stopped. She raised the scarecrow and pointed it westward. From the shadows, animals emerged—birds, rodents, insects—all drawn to it as if commanded, their bodies still and their eyes fixed on the tattered figure.

She turned it east, and creatures from that direction responded too. Birds descended from the trees, insects crawled out of the soil, and rodents froze mid-run. All of them transfixed, their gaze locked on the scarecrow, as though bound by an unseen force.

I stood paralyzed, my mind screaming but my body frozen in place.

Luke, with a blank expression, picked up a rock and, without hesitation, began smashing the animals one by one.

Each brutal strike was met with a sickening thud, and yet none of the creatures moved—they remained rooted to their spots, oblivious to the carnage unfolding around them.

My chest tightened as I staggered back, gasping for air. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real.

Then Luke bent down, grabbed a dead rodent from the ground, and sank his teeth into it. He bit into the fur with the desperation of a ravenous animal, blood smearing his lips as he chewed, completely lost in the frenzy.

A wave of nausea washed over me as I realized how the scarecrow was controlling my children, transforming them into something unnatural, something monstrous.

A torrent of anger erupted inside me, every cell in my body pulsing with raw fury. My hands shook, but my mind was suddenly clear—I knew exactly what I had to do.

I dropped my lantern and rushed toward Emma, yanking the scarecrow from her hands and then hurling it to the ground.

My kids remained mute spectators, rooted to their spots as they continued to be trapped in their hypnotic trance.

I grabbed the lantern, and smashed it against the scarecrow with all my might.  It shattered on impact, igniting the scarecrow in flames. Without hesitation, I fired my shotgun at the fuel-soaked straw, and an explosion erupted, engulfing the figure in a fiery blaze.

Emma blinked for the first time, as if suddenly waking from a dream, confused about how she had ended up in the middle of the field. My son, Luke, stared down at his blood-stained hands, clutching the dead rat. Horror washed over his face, his lip trembling as he met my eyes.

“I didn’t mean to, Daddy... I didn’t mean to...” he sobbed, wiping the blood from his mouth with the back of his hand.

I dropped to my knees, pulling both of them into my arms, as the fire crackled and roared, the acrid smell of burning straw filling the air. Together, we slowly walked back to the house, each step laden with the weight of what had just transpired.

Over the following weeks, my crops flourished, yielding a harvest that far exceeded my expectations. We were pulled back from the brink of financial ruin, but it came at a cost.

Both Emma and Luke suffered from relentless nightmares, waking up screaming in the night, and it would be months before they could fully recover. I, too, struggled with sleep, waking in the dead of night, drenched in sweat, haunted by the memory of the scarecrow.

“It’s gone,” I kept telling myself. “The scarecrow is gone.”

And every night, I prayed that it would stay that way.
