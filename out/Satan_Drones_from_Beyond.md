I'd heard about all these drones flying around all over the place. Some people thought they were UFO's. I saw a few of the videos and pictures on the internet, but they just looked like planes to me. Little did I know that I'd soon find out something about those drones. Something evil.

That was about a week ago I guess. It's still going on supposedly, but it was only a few days into the whole affair when I was whisked into the story myself. I'd forgotten all about the news story by then to be honest. I was just sitting there one morning drinking my coffee at the kitchen table and playing Angry Birds on my laptop when I felt a strange sensation in the pit of my stomach.

It felt like that tingling feeling you get in your gut when you go down a drop on a roller-coaster. Only there was no logical reason for it. I thought maybe the coffee was bad so I dumped it out. I use milk as a creamer so I opened up the milk jug and gave the contents a sniff. Didn't smell bad.

Then I heard something. It was a deep vibrating tone. So deep it was barely noticeable but it seemed to cause the spot in my tummy where that feeling was to tremble. I walked around the kitchen a little bit and on one side of the room it seemed to be stronger.

I peeked out the kitchen window there, and above some tall bushes next to the window was something black that looked like a metal pole that might be part of some kind of lawn equipment. I couldn't see what it was attached to because the bush was in the way.

"Oh, that damn Perry Goodmyer," I said out loud, "he's always trimming and edging his dang lawn. Think I'll have a word with him."

When I opened the front door of the house and stepped outside, the tone and the sensation got a bit stronger. I closed the door behind me and trounced across the grass and rounded the corner of the house to get a look at Perry's latest contraption.

I was expecting some kind of wood chipper for branches but when I saw what was there I stopped dead in my tracks and just stared for a moment, stunned into suspended confusion.

It was black in color all over. It had metal poles of some kind protruding out and bending around it's exterior. It wasn't obvious what they were for. It's over all appearance reminded me of a bug, only this thing was the size of an SUV. Just like they said on the News. It's body was squarish or more like a rectangular block with all sorts of fins and strange indentations all around it. And it was hovering about three feet off the ground.

The grass just under it was vibrating. You could see it moving. The deep tone was loud and permeated everything. Even my bones felt like they were shaking to the frequency.

But see, the thing is I don't think it was actually a machine at all. It seemed more to me to be mimicking what a machine might look like. There was nothing on it that seemed to have a function. No windows or cameras or antenna. No wings or propellers, or exhaust ports. It was like a floating power transformer but with all kinds of extra junk randomly attached to it.

That wasn't really why I came to believe it wasn't a machine though. It was the feeling it gave off. It literally emitted an emotion and an intent. It was just as strong and obvious that that was what it was doing as the tone was obvious. It was literally broadcasting it's conscious state of mind to everything around it.

It was gut wrenching. The feeling I mean. It was a mixture of total malevolence, total lack of compassion, and a feeling of certain and absolute doom. The thing was an abomination. It was unholy and it knew it.

All I wanted to do was flee, but I was paralyzed in terror and mortification. I couldn't even scream. I just stood there in total dis-empowered helplessness.

It intended me to approach it but I didn't want to. It demanded I walk up to it and touch a small flat area on the side facing me. I started to step forward just to appease it and get some relief from it's incessant psychic demand.

It was buzzing like an old fashioned space heater and the sound was both frightening and sickening. The air felt like static electricity as I got closer. I noticed goose bumps across my arm as I reached out for it. With a gut full of dread I made contact with only the tips of my index and middle fingers.

At that moment and in a single moment, everything seemed to drop away. It's hard to describe. It was like my mind fell downwards through my body, turning me inside out as it did. The world seemed to turn upside down but I knew I was still standing upright and still with my hand on the damned thing.

There were some spiny things on it above where I was touching it which opened up into a circular gaping wound. That's right. Wound. Instead of a hatch or window opening, it presented the same function to me as an injury. I could tell it did so for the sole purpose of disturbing me.

Inside it showed me a vision of horrific suffering. A display of small animals lay inside it's belly. All alive but grotesquely injured. They writhed in pain and strained at getting out. The poor things reached out to me with their paws in desperate hope for salvation. And I wanted to save them. I tried to force myself to thrust my arm into the opening and rescue as many as I could. I pushed hard to move my limbs to do this but they would not budge.

Tears were streaming down my face. I could feel them. Hot air bellowed out of the thing scorching my face like summer day's sun. I strained even harder to move. I had to save at least one of these little guys.

Just as I broke the spell and my arm flung in towards the animals, a large metal device of some kind rotated from the side and brought an anvil sized block of metal down into them, smashing their bodies into a bloody mess before my eyes.

The thing did this just to sicken me. To demoralize me.

I was shaking in fear and absolute terror. Was I next?

Whatever sent this thing was the embodiment of evil. An evil so complete that it had no desire for it's own benefit, like a thief, or even a rapist might have. No, it wasn't out for it's own gain. It's only purpose was to cause harm and suffering. But not merely physical pain, it was more interested in inflicting psychological and emotional pain. It was built specifically to do just that.

I sensed it's satisfaction at my internal response and it began to lift into the air. I fell to the ground and watched it ascend, now utterly bawling my eyes out.

"Don't you ever come back here!" I shouted between sobs. "Don't you ever come back, you bastard!"

It rose way up into the sky and then headed Northward until it disappeared behind some trees and I could no longer see it.

That night when my third grade daughter and my husband got home, I gathered them together in the living room. We watched my favorite Christmas movie and cuddled under a blanket with our little dog Squiggly. I held them all tight. So tight. I'll never ever let them go.
