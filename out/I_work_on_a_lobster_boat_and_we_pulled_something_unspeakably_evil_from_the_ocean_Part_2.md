I didn’t scream and didn't even feel like it because it was the least shocking development of the last fifteen minutes.

Maybe if his eyes were turned toward me, rather than facing out into the darkness, it would have struck me more. When the Coast Guard cut him down later, I saw the whites of his eyes were blood red, the capillaries having exploded from the pressure of the belt around his neck.

But at that moment, he was just a dead guy. A dead guy who killed a former crew member, whose father had raped me in the stairwell of that parking garage. 

His father. 

There was a noise behind me and it was the wheelhouse door opening. I turned slowly, expecting it to be Mac. It was Levi. With his fingers he made a gesture for me to come. “You don’t have to be worried,” he said. I wasn’t about to take his word for it.

“I won’t let him hurt you. But it’s time to talk because there are things to be settled.”

“I don’t want to talk, and I don’t want to settle anything,” I said. 

“He can’t hurt you,” Levi replied.

“Can you…” I trailed off.

“Hurt you? I cannot. But I can protect you. Now please come, because the time is growing short,” he said. 

He turned and went back down into the berth. I stood there for a moment, not contemplating whether to follow but steeling myself for what was coming. 

I climbed down the ladder and Levi was sitting across from Mac. Mac had his head in his hands. When he heard me coming he looked up and his eyes were red. I was going to tell him about Billy, but I could tell he already knew.

Levi patted the wooden bench a couple of times next to him. I sat. “Now. Why don’t you tell her why you did it?” Levi said to Mac.

I managed to croak out a hushed “No,” but part of me wanted to hear. I had never reported it. I'd swallowed it whole, until it consumed me from the inside out. So I wanted to know, but I wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of begging for it.

Mac shook his head and looked down at the water sloshing around the rock. “He made me,” he finally said. I knew who the he in question was. But Levi didn’t move, he stared straight ahead as he always seemed to in these moments.

“He came to us one night when we were out here. And he told me that he needed someone to help him, and that someone was me. He said he needed a young woman and Billy chose you.” Mac stopped, swallowed hard. 

Levi looked at me and said that it was my turn. We all have to confess what we did. "We need to make things square," he said. Of course I knew what he was talking about, so I started to confess because I knew I had to. I had to make things square.

Before I tell you what I said, there’s one thing I haven’t told you about that night in the stairwell. Mostly because the details were a little blurry, the brain blocking out trauma and all that. When I thought of “the incident” I didn’t actually remember Mac, well...entering me. 

What I do remember from that night was a pinch, something cold, hard, and plastic pushing into me. 
 
*************************
My friend Jackie bought a scratch ticket the weekend we were staying at her parents’ house while they were in Florida on vacation. We were buying cigarettes at the Cumberland Farms and she had a dollar in change leftover. 

She squinted past the cashier and asked for a number eleven scratch ticket. It was the Moose Money ticket. You match three dollar amounts, you win that amount. You get a moose, you win all the prize amounts. 

We stepped out into the parking lot and Jackie used the key to the house to scratch it off. The first one was $5,000. The next was $5,000. This is how they hook you and get you to keep playing. I was so close to winning, I just needed to scratch off another $5,000. Give me three more Lucky 7’s.

The next was $1,000. Then, the edge of the key kicked up the silver dust to reveal $10,000. Then another $10,000. The last one was probably going to be $1.00, as it invariably was. But as Jackie started to scratch I realized that what I thought was a dollar sign was the top of an antler. 

Pass go and collect your winnings from the coffers of the Maine State Lottery. Twenty-one thousand cold ones, before taxes of course. We looked at each other and shrieked. 

Rather than the eighths and tenths we usually bought, that night we splurged. I don’t’ remember how much H we got, but we used the ticket as collateral. Jackie would cash it the following Monday. You can’t just hand that one over at the store, you have to go to the lottery commission and get your picture taken with a giant check.

So we went back to the house and took a trip to the moon. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw Jackie passed out next to me on the couch. The scratcher was on the coffee table. 

I got up and went to the bathroom. I stared at myself in the mirror and hated what I saw. I opened the medicine cabinet and wasn’t exactly sure what I was looking for. Even when you’re high as fuck, you still have that urge to poke around in other people’s medicine cabinets. I did it many times when I broke into those camps around Sebago Lake. 

It was staring back at me. Jackie’s mother was a diabetic and there was a bottle of insulin on the shelf. 

***

I waited for Jackie to stir. When she came around I asked her if she wanted some more and she said yes. I gave her the needle that I had already prepped. I watched her tie off and inject it into her arm. Soon, she was back out. 

I didn’t wait around for the seizures to start. That’s what happens when a non-diabetic takes insulin. But it will kill you just as easily as fentanyl, and it doesn’t leave a trace. The coroner just assumes it’s an OD.

Jackie’s parents came home from Florida and found her the following Monday. That was the day I went to the lottery commission and cashed the ticket and got my picture taken with a big fucking check.

So now you know what I did, what my secret is. I killed a friend with a hotshot for $21,000, before taxes. I don’t blame it on the drugs. Or the fact that I was violated with a in the stairwell of a parking garage and inseminated. I take the blame. I killed her, and for that I will always be sorry.  But I know where I can shove my sorries.

I buried the lede a bit here and I’m not just a junkie who broke into seasonal camps to feed my habit. So I don’t expect any sympathy for this and that’s not why I’m writing this down. 

When I finished telling the story to Mac and Levi, Mac tried to tell me it wasn’t my fault and I told him it was my fault because I was too weak. The same way it was his fault that he shoved that turkey baster inside of me and squeezed the bulb. 

***
Levi told me that we were all square. Square with who, exactly was unsaid. He stood up and went toward the ladder. He started to climb up and Mac lunged for his leg. 

But he was too slow. Or maybe it was that Levi was too fast. Because before Mac could get to him, Levi pounced down from the ladder, springing off of it like a gargoyle on a parapet that had been animated to life. 

Mac was big and Levi was small but it didn’t matter. The force when Levi hit him in the chest knocked Mac back, slamming him onto the bottom of the boat, the back of his head smashing into the protruding rock. 

Mac’s head made a sickening sound, like a cantaloupe being dropped from the third story onto the sidewalk. I was sure he was dead, but just to be sure, Levi took his hands and pounded Mac’s head back into the rock over and over and over.

I didn’t scream and didn’t feel like it. I watched and felt something welling inside of me that felt like a laugh. But that didn’t come out either and it subsided.

The only thing I felt as I watched Levi kill him a hundred times over was a wet sensation in my underwear.
