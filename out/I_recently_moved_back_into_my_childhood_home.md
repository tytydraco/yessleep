Do you ever catch yourself staring out of your windows at night? Drawn by some terrible magnetism, do your eyes bore into the blackness beyond those fragile panes? Throughout my childhood I felt it too. The phantom gaze which triggers that skin-prickling sense of exposure.

I grew up in a small town of about three hundred people until I was about eight. I lived in a house on the outskirts to the north, just off the right arm of a stretch of highway we called "the big Y" where our nearest neighbors were at least three miles away. I've always called that place: "The White House on the Hill".

After twenty years I've found myself here again, with little choice in rentals other than this seemingly perennial structure whose nourishment my engrams provided. Whose leer compels flight as, half-veiled in brambles, it observes my approach each day from the foot of that hill. Even now, as I type this, I feel the anticipation of surveillance on the precipice of intrusion. My back is to the multitudes of windows in this sunroom, and for the sake of nostalgia I haven't brought myself to shade them. I know that a barrier would help. I know that the paranoia may be from the understanding of the real danger I may have been in as a child. Though, I keep asking myself: where is the activity I remember? Why has nothing happened now that I've settled back in? Are these memories false?

What begins here are the memories I've reclaimed. I believe residing again within these walls has worked  like some familiar aromas might; serving as mnemonic pontoons to lift my memories from the twilight zone of my mental sea. Some of these memories revolve around a central thing. Tonight I've settled on the theme of windows.

Let me start by saying: My parents are great people. They just weren't great for each other. Screaming matches were a near-nightly occurrence back then. You could often find me clutching onto one of my parent's legs, hoping my presence would elicit a cease fire. Then one of those innumerable nights, something changed. Not with the routine of mutually assured destruction, but with the atmosphere. I couldn't help myself the first time it occurred. My head began to turn to the exposed windows which flanked the gas heater in our living room. Exclamations and pointed remarks were blunted by my captivation, and I felt my gaze drawn to a point outside. A heaviness descended like a predator drawn to prey. . . 

And I saw nothing. . .

The window on the right. That was always the one. The one that carried that foreboding. All that currently separates me from that very same portal as I write is a supporting wall. Back when I was a child, I thought my bedroom was the best escape. The barrier of my door muffled the death rattle of my family, and concealed me from the window. It worked for a while.

I don't know which came first: the scratching in the walls or the birds. 

The latter shook the dining room's windowpane with a vitrificatious thunder, leaving their tiny red bodies agonizingly contorted. In the weeks that followed, my parents would try to shelter me from the sight of those mangled cardinals. They would ultimately fail. One specific morning as I crouched over my cereal bowl amidst an open refrigerator, milk flowing from the tilted gallon, that characteristic noise sounded. When it wasn't followed by adult inquiry, I resolved to investigate on my own despite the pounding in my chest. It was a short distance to the front door, and not much further around the corner of the house. The end of that trepidatious trek rewarded me with my second - and at that time closest - encounter with the concept of death. 

The former, that is, the scratching in the walls, was later explained to me. You see, there was a six week old kitten that had been doing it for the better part of a year. Mila, as I would name her, was a grey tabby with a scar over her left eye. It was clear, even to my six-year-old mind, that this was not the culprit. The noise she had made was only a gentle mewing beneath my floorboards. Far before her birth, the scratching had come from much higher. It glid across the ceiling trim and fell through the paneling, widening my eyes toward the sheets I would sink into at its advent. The innocent image of my bright red race car bed with its vintage Star Wars sheets became a prison, my body a cell. Then came the jailer, announcing itself with a prayer:

Now I lay me down to sleep,

I pray the Lord my soul to keep,

If I die before I wake,

I pray the Lord my soul to take.

In the midst of its recitation I folded my bedding from me. It revealed the worst gift I had ever received. A small, white stuffed bear, whose black, spheroid eyes reflected my own, lifting my heartbeat into my ears. As it finished the promise of the third line, the voice within its speaker distorted as if the batteries had failed. The scraping ceased with the verse, and suddenly I was in silence. Free to spring from my mattress and slide down the hood of my bed. 

Those spectral nails had hollowed out a place within me, and seemingly, within noise itself. Though, where fear flowed in to fill my own void, a familiar primordial dread came into that vacuum of sound. It's aura permeated the air, creeping through the minute cracks in my antiquated windowsill. Without any reply from the autumn leaves, I felt it press closer, chilling the deep blue air. Stillness and anticipation swelled like a wave and broke with the sound of a trio of knocks. The panes rattled at the false inquiry, and a gasp split my clenched jaw as if offering my leaping heart an avenue of escape. The dull rapping came again, and again, and then fell into an incessant cacophony. I was sent into a mindless flight. I swung open my closet door and pulled myself through it, clambering onto the boxes within. On my hands and knees I pressed through my clothes, blindly pushing deeper, chased by the noise at that window until I ultimately felt something solid and pressed my back against it. It was then that all sound ceased once more, and fearing it as a harbinger, I dug my heels in and cupped the sharp breaths escaping my lips. The last thing I remember is falling out of my parent's closet door.
