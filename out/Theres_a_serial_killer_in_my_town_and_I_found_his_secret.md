 

For some backstory a couple of years ago back when I was still your average joe cop I was given a new case of a murder and I had been given these before so I just assumed it was your typical case where eventually you will find something but I never found anything and as time passed the body count kept adding up but we couldn’t find anything. The victims didn’t have anything that connected them all; it just seemed like the killer was killing without a motive other than because they wanted to. All that I could find was that they were all killed with a knife and they were all killed inside of the city. That doesn’t mean none of them were visitors because a few of them were. 

After about two years of investigating the case I got a new partner because my previous partner retired. He was apparently some sort of prodigy when it came to solving cases so I was happy to get his help but after he made a few discoveries most of them I already found he got stuck too. I always felt like something was right in front of my face that I should be seeing but I just couldn’t. One day I went to my brother’s D&D game and brought my partner (this was their first time meeting and I invited him because he was kind of a nerd). At the end of the game my partner said he would be looking into the case a little more so I just told him I’d see him in the morning and that was that. It was normal for my partner to do this because he was obsessed with the case. I think it was because it was the one case he couldn’t solve. 

When I woke up the next morning I had a voicemail from my partner and people from the station telling me I had to get there as soon as I could. So I drove without listening to the voicemail. When I got there people informed me that they walked in and saw my partner. He was dead. He had been stabbed at least 27 times. I remembered the voicemail he sent so I listened and essentially he said that he found something that I needed to hear and that it could blow the case wide open. Everyday I regret going to sleep that night. Maybe if I had just stayed up and gotten the voicemail and driven on over he would still be alive but I wasn’t awake.

Eventually I just gave up on the case and went on with my life. The killer continued to kill and I would still check out the bodies and see what I could find but ultimately nothing came of it. Until about 2 years after my partner’s death. I was bored and had a lot of time on my hands so I opened the case files and started searching through. I decided to start searching through the first names to see if they spelled anything but found nothing. I did the same with the middle and last names but still found nothing. I tried a couple other things and decided to check out the very limited amount of evidence we had and found  a book inside which I remembered had some sort of random selection of letters which were “Will Is Lamb lost Ink After Monkey” then it went down a line and read “Being red and dark silk over never” then it hit me the first letter of every word spelled out William Bradson, my brother. 

I immediately started driving to my brother’s house and when I got there I somehow knew and didn’t know what I was going to do. As he opened the door He said that I didn’t look ok and I told him that I knew his big secret. I told him that I knew he was the killer I had been looking for. He asked me what I was talking about and I told him to drop the act. I told him that I found his clue and he reached into his pocket for something so I shot him. I then heard a buzzing sound coming from the pocket he was reaching into and I realized he wasn’t reaching for a weapon but rather his phone. I decided to pick it up when I heard a deep voice say “hello officer Bradson, it seems like you beat me to my victim, now this means that you are my pawn. I know that you killed an innocent man and I have evidence to prove it, so from now on you will do as I say. Goodbye officer.” and he hung up. 

Since that day I have done everything he asks ranging from destroying evidence to killing fellow officers. However, Instead of destroying the evidence I have been hiding it and I found who it is and I’m about to expose him. If I don’t update in a couple of days then he discovered my secret and I’m most likely 6 feet under.
