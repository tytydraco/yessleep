For anyone that was busy last week

Shock, pain, fear. We all feel it in our own ways. Sveta stands aghast. Mike tries to look enraged, but it doesn't reach his eyes, nor the tears falling from them. Demi hurls occult oaths of vengeance and Leo begins to pray. Even Herman has blanched at the brutality of the massive canine in front of us. 

Me? I try to calm myself, push down the tidal wave of fear long enough to try and find us a way out of this situation. 

People talk about hope and fear like they're opposites. But in my experience that's incorrect. Fear needs hope like a fire needs air. 

Looking at the remains of the youngest member of our twisted family melted into a pile of refuse and slag, makes it easy to stop hoping. 

"Could really use your help, Punch!", Leo shouts. His prayer makes the shots he fires into the hellhound glow with a brilliant blue light, but they may as well  be paintballs. 

I don't reply, I breathe. I think, I try to detach myself from what's going on. 

I get a glimpse into the mind of the hellhound. It's simple, ancient, and hits me with a brutal reality. 

There is only it's task. A devotion to it's owner that’s an integral part of it's being. This creature is as much curse as paranormal dog. 

It has no fears, no wants or needs, only obedience. 

I start to back up, understanding what we’re up against. 

"All I know is that it's been told to leave you alive and kill all of us in the worst way possible in front of you. We need to run Leo.", I say, panic and fear taking over my mind. 

"We can't leave Alex!", Mike yells.

"Mike, she isn't moving.", Leo says, pain and defeat in his voice. 

"What if she comes back in 5 minutes? Lost, stuck here, mind all fucked up.", Mike pleads. I don't like the tone I’m hearing. It's the sounds of a psyche close to the breaking point. 

"And what if it takes a week? Or a year, or a decade?

I don't know if Alex is dead or alive, but I do know that she wouldn't want us getting killed.", Sveta says, calmingly. 

"Outrunning this thing hasn't worked out well for us so far.", Demi adds.

The Hellhound slowly starts walking forward. Those demonically intelligent eyes pour over us, deciding it's next victim. 

We're all moving backward now. Keeping our eyes on the Hellhound. 

"Fuck!", Mike screams, "I didn't want to do this, but I've been holding something back."

I catch a confused look from Demi, and a subtle elbow to his ribs from Mike. 

"Michael, you said that wasn't to be used.", Demi says. 

"I know, but I don't see things getting much worse than this.

Punch, Herman, I need two regular people.  God damn I hope you both count.", Mike says, sounding nervous. 

"What do you need?", I ask. 

"Get close to me, I'm going to ask you both a question. You need to answer at the exact same time. 

Herman, you got that facelift helping punch, right?", Mike questions. 

"Yes, but what does that have to do...", Herman begins. 

"No time to explain.", Mike says, taking in a large breath, "Remember, no hesitation. 

How did Herman lose the ear?"

The medium of writing isn't going to do justice to how in synch Herman and my timing was. Though it'll do just fine showing our answers. 

"Torn off.", Herman shouts.

"Meat cleaver.", I say at the same time. 

As if it was the period at the end of my sentence, there’s a wet, loud crack and Herman hits the ground screaming and clutching his knee. 

"Mike!", Sveta screams. 

"What the hell?", Leo adds. 

Mike doesn't reply, simply stomps on Herman's kneecap. 

"Run!", he yells, following his own advice. 

The Hellhound seems to grin, walking over to the crippled Herman.

We all follow Mike, it's not like we have another option. 

"What in the fuck is wrong with you?", Leo says to Mike, vaulting a small pile of trash. 

Screams from behind us, shrill and drawn out. None of us look backwards.

"I'm getting tired of being the Velma in our Scooby gang.", Mike replies. 

I stay silent, but wonder how he knew. 

"While I don't have the foggiest as to the meaning of that reference, I would like an explanation as to why you killed our only ally here.", Demi says. 

The noises of pain and violence echo down the alleyway. 

"Punch, you want to chime in here?", Mike asks, exertion starting to show in his voice. 

"There were no cannibals. Herman wanted to do some kind of experiment on me. I Got out, turned the tables, but figured he’d be more useful to us if I kept it under wraps. 

How the hell did you know?", I ask. 

"Solving crime is my strong suit. And beyond that, he was H.H fucking Holmes. If I was wrong, I figured I’d still be in the black from a karmic standpoint.", Mike replies. 

We push ourselves to the limit, all of us running with burning lungs and cramping muscles. The alley isn't infinite, we’re close enough to the end to make out figures milling in the street.

Herman's final scream is painful, even at this distance. By the time it's echoes stop we can hear the hellhound, back on the hunt and gaining momentum.

Smoke is pouring from Agnus' bar now. A thick black wall of it creeps down the alley. 

The hellhound bursts through, Herman's blood still sizzling and boiling on it's demonic maws. 

The exit is close, but I don't know if it's close enough. 

All of us are running out of steam, and with every second the massive footsteps get that much closer. 

A huge, clawed paw slams into the ground beside me. I'm almost knocked off balance but Leo manages to catch me. 

At this point we're not even running away, we're practically under the creature. 

It's bulk is the only thing keeping us alive. Any attack it tries in pursuit is slowed by garbage, debris, and the narrow alley itself.

We scramble, dive and skitter in any direction we can. Getting to the end of the alley is an afterthought at this point, we're just trying to survive. 

Mike gets knocked to the ground, hard enough to tear a gash in his face. He wipes the blood from his chin and yells, "It's just toying with us." as he gets to his feet. 

I can't say I disagree. The hellhound could have killed or incapacitated us all a half dozen  times at this point. 

As if in response to Mike's statement the hellhound goes still. 

It backs up slightly, turning to face all of us. It gives us a second to catch our breath. Canine maws drooling boiling saliva. 

All three heads give us a grin that's too human, then one nods toward the end of the alley, as if to say, "Go ahead, try your best."

We stand in a group, broken, trapped, but unbent. 

"I'll get it's attention. Buy you guys a little time to get away.", Mike whispers. 

"No, we're not going to just start sacrificing people to it.", Leo begins, "Can't run, can't kill it. All that's left is to see if we can make it remember us."

A mood passes through us like a sickness. Leo's right, and he doesn't need his power to convince us. 

The fucking dog laughs. 

It's a horrible sound, the chortle of a bully, the cackle of a lunatic and the call of a wolf all blended together into a terrifying symphony. 

In a film, this would be where the pop-metal kicks in and we all manage to pull off killing this thing with nothing more than a devil-may-care attitude and grit. 

But, this isn't a Sam Rami production. We're taking the first steps toward our death, and for no better reason than pissing off the wrong psychopath. 

At first, we think an explosive has went off down the alley. Likely some more random carnage from Travis' people. 

But it doesn't die out, it's more like an avalanche of cement than an explosion. 

The black smoke choking the alley obscures our view. 

The Hellhound slowly moves forward, daring one of us to be the first to die valiantly. 

It's Leo, because of course it's Leo. He takes a step forward, holding not a pistol, or blade, but an oak and brass cross. 

A scream, something so unnatural it's alien even in this cursed place. Like if rusted steel was suddenly given a voice.

A sound like a highway pile-up coming down the alley. The ground trembles slightly, hairline fractures appear in the walls around us.

We take a moment, looking to each other. The hellhound seems unconcerned. 

The sound of cement and steel starts to subside, replaced by an earth shaking, plodding walk.

As the sound turns to a jog, pieces of glass and cinderblocks begin to rain from the buildings around us. 

By the time it's quickened to a run, even the hellhound has taken a moment to try and figure out what's going on. 

It'd be smart to use it's distraction to run. Before we can though, something grabs our attention. 

A voice, like nothing I've heard. Neither male nor female, not god or mortal. It's shrillness cuts like a razor, it's resonance kicks up masonry dust in small whirlwinds. 

"Nine", it says.

"What the hell?", Sveta says. Clearly as surprized as I am. 

"Nine.", The voice says, closer this time. 

The Hellhound lowers itself, growling at whatever is hiding in the cloud of smoke and dust. 

"Nine.", the voice screams. It draws this sound out into a soul shaking roar as it reveals itself.

It dwarfs everything we've seen, It's anatomy is chaos. 

Twenty feet in the air what was once a ribcage drifts out of the opaque cloud. It's been elongated, warped and twisted into a massive bear-trap like maw. Inside of this, is what could, generously be described as a face. Mismatched eyes, and a crooked mouth-like orifice capable of swallowing a bison.

It's held aloft by dozens of feet of vertebrae, rusted steel and detritus. It's wrapped in a translucent, purple skin, weeping thick crimson fluid. 

Smoke clings to this thing as it's bottom half is revealed. Thick, bone plated legs, as wide as a dumpster propel the creature. Though even their bulk can't possibly be holding the tons of abomination aloft. It sways, snakelike, as it walks. 

"Nine!", it roars in challenge to the Hellhound. It spreads it's maw wide enough to scrape both walls of the alley. 

I can't help but cry. Not a comic book tear while I stand stoic either. This thing, it's Alex. Or what's left of her anyway. 

For a moment, everything seems far away. I can't catch my breath, I think back to first meeting this brave kid.

The collision of the two behemoths is too much to ignore. 

We're all held rapt, the display of power in front of us connecting to some primal, fearful part of our brain. Overriding all sense. 

The Hellhound has no fear to show, leaping straight at the horror that was Alex. 

My heart skips a beat as three heads clamp down on Alex's almost fluid body ( for lack of a better term). 

Serrated teeth find no purchase. A gout of hellfire does nothing more than leave Alex walking through a heat haze. 

But as she attempts to return the favor, we understand this isn't going to be a one sided fight. 

Bone spurs and muscles ran through with rebar drive her maw hard enough to crack concrete. But it leaves little more than long bloody scratches on the Hellhound. 

The two begin a brutal, primal struggle. To try and describe it blow by blow would be impossible. 

The two giants twist and snarl. The hellhound pollutes the area with various types of energy. 

The buildings begin to shake, Alex opens a wound in the Hellhound, putting a rebar studded knee into the side of the beast. 

Thick, tarry blood stains the ground. 

Light, an explosion, and pain snap me back to reality. 

Leo holds a smoking pistol, he just put a round into the ground at our feet. 

"Don't waste this!", he says turning to the end of the alley. 

"Herman's mansion!", Mike screams to Alex. There's no way his voice isn't lost in the deafening noise of battle. 

A keening screech from the hellhound quickens our pace. I turn back long enough to see the sonic attack start to crack parts of Alex's body.

"A half dozen to the right of the exit.", I say.

"We go left then take the scenic route.", Leo replies. 

Finding those moments of calm, of clarity in this running battle, is difficult. Beyond that, it makes me feel cold, distant. Not in some paranormal way either. More like the universe is trying to force me to be someone I'm not. 

The street is lively, populated with hundreds of denizens of the city. The carnage behind us gains a few looks, but most seem unconcerned. 

The six fallen heroes are far enough away, we go unnoticed. We keep our heads down, trying to avoid attention. 

As we walk in silence, my mind starts to wander. Self hatred starts to chip away at the foundation of justification I've built for all of the immoral things we've done. 

I know anyone who's followed me this far is thinking, "But Punch, what you've done is justified, you're saving the world!". And I appreciate that, it keeps me going. 

But on the other hand, that's coming from people a step removed. I'm sure none of you want to see the world end, but you also want to see me win. 

I can't help but think, maybe if I wasn't concerned with winning, I could have done things in a way that didn't end up with a pre-teen having her body and soul mutilated. 

It's this toxic line of logic that scares me, makes me lose that connection I have. 

"Shit, go into this store, the girl in the blue, she's one of them.", I warn. 

No one questions me, simply walks into the nearest door, as casually as possible. 

I'm glad to see the shelves are filled with nothing more esoteric than orange soda flavored pop-tarts. Even here, people need snacks and toilet paper, I guess. 

Behind the counter is a man who is a miraculously healthy seventy years old. He's engaged in a conversation with a woman covered in thick, industrial piercings, and tattooed glyphs. 

"Did she see us?", Sveta whispers, pretending to look at various products. 

"No idea.", I reply. 

We all do our best to look like nothing more than customers. The owner is giving us more than a casual glance, but I get the feeling he's worried more about his stock walking off than our misadventures. 

I catch sight of her first. 

She's young, 17 maybe 20 at most. She wears a brand new, pale blue knee-length jacket. Her hair is dyed a subtle shade of blue, the same as her nails. 

I get a brief glimpse into who she is. Powerful, and a recent convert to Travis' crew. 

I open my mouth to warn everyone, maybe make a dash for the door but she speaks first. 

"Stop.", she says. 

The force, the paranormal backing to this statement makes Leo look like a stage magician. 

Everyone in the store freezes. An antique looking clock on the wall stops dead, freezers shut down. Anything doing something, simply, stops.

I feel pride coming from the young woman, I get the sense she hasn't used this ability much. But there's something else there, something you don't need a connection to the paranormal to see. 

She's nervous. 

"I'm going to make a phone call, then we all wait here till my boss shows up.", The blue clad woman says. 

I'm watching the lone customer of the store. I notice one hand start to move, then subtle flexing of her bicep. 

The woman in blue darts her gaze from one of us to the next, she's got a bad feeling. I don't like the combination of overly powerful and jumpy. 

I wish I knew how she did it, but the piercing covered woman starts to inch slowly toward the door. 

She gets about half way there before the once-Hero notices. 

"Die.", she says. The voice seeming to come from everywhere. 

The pierced woman falls to the ground, still, not breathing. Travis' agent starts to bleed from her nose. 

She's practically twitching now, trying to keep her eye on us. Nerves frayed, young and with the power to kill with a word. 

She reaches into her coat, pulling out a flip phone. 

"I wouldn't do that.", Mike says, unseen from the back of the store. 

There's the sound of a blade being drawn. Too loud to not be purposeful. 

"Who's there?", The woman in blue demands. 

"I'm Mike. What's your name?", Mike asks, comfortingly.

The woman in blue scowls, free hand hovering near a small pistol on her hip. 

The overhead lights in the back of the store shatter, making the already dank area impossible to see. 

"Come on, hon, I need to call you something.", Mike's voice comes closer. 

She stays silent. 

"You seem a little paranoid, kid. No offense.", Mike remarks. 

"My name is Zelma Godsend.", Zelma says, defiantly. 

Mike laughs.

"Of course it is. You like true crime, Zelma?", the hidden clown asks. 

"Fuck you.", Zelma replies. 

Mike steps out from between the isles, into the light.

Any of you guys seen the movie Rudy? It's old, but football movies are kind of timeless. For those of you that haven't, it's about a guy who loves football but is just good enough to suck at a professional level. 

It's more uplifting in context. 

And that's kind of how I’ve came to see Mike. 

It comes from actually knowing him, knowing who, and what he is. 

Seeing someone react to him for the first time though, someone who doesn't see a broken guy from New York, but a murderous possibly paranormal clown. It's entertaining. 

He holds an oversized combat knife low. He twists and turns it to catch the scant  light of the store. 

"Stop!", Zelma demands.

Blood starts to pour from her nose in a steady trickle. Mike keeps walking. 

"See, I love true crime. Warms my heart to see that the worst people out there also end up being the stupidest. 

But now I’m going off on a tangent.", Mike begins. 

"Stop!", Zelma repeats.

Her right ear starts to bleed. 

"My favorite podcast, has a saying, 'call your dad, you're in a cult'.", Mike continues. 

He's almost within arm's reach. 

"Die!", she says, the command is so strong I feel my heart skip a beat. 

"Don't think I’ll be doing that.", is Mike's reply. 

Zelma is in a panic, she realizes how close Mike is, her hand darts to her pistol. 

"Hands off the fucking gun!", Mike screams, his tone changing so abruptly it startles Zelma into inaction.

She's a deer in the headlights, with an almost imperceptible step Mike is close enough to be breathing her air. His blade against her stomach. 

She regains her wits enough to open her phone.

"You could do that. And if you did, it'd be the end of us.", Mike begins sounding more like a guidance counselor than a lunatic, "But then I'm going to pin you to the wall with this knife. 

Before I do that though, I'm going to lift you just high enough you're on your tiptoes. 

See, my knife is big, it'll plug it's own wound. No need to worry about bleeding out. 

But unless you're a ballerina, you're not going to be able to hold that pose for very long. 

Let's say you manage to avoid slowly disembowelling yourself till your boss shows up, just for funsies. 

You saw the serrations, there’s no way this thing is getting out of someone without one hell of a surgeon.

I don't know about you, but Travis doesn't really strike me as the compassionate type. You'll be lucky if he spares a bullet to put you out of your misery, let alone gets you a doctor."

Mike smirks down toward Zelma. She tries to come up with a response, but has none. 

The clown then slowly kneels, getting face to face with the young woman. 

"But believe it or not, Zelma, I don't want to go down that road. So, how about you pick what's behind door number two?

You let my friends and I sneak out the back door. Forget you ever saw us. If anyone asks you killed the lady on the ground for mouthing off. 

Then, at the first opportunity, you get the hell out of this place, then call your dad, because you're in a fucking cult.", Mike offers. 

The tension is palpable.

"Go.", Zelma says after what feels like an eternity. 

We can move and use this newfound freedom instantly. 

We spend the next hour taking a looping route back to Page. Avoiding Travis' men by mere feet at points.

"How are we going to know where these horses are?", Sveta asks as we walk into Page. 

"Don't worry I have someone on the inside.", I reply as we enter the hotel. 

"Where's Herman?", Page asks me. 

"Dead, we're running a bit short on time though. He said he left us some horses?", I reply. 

"Horses? They would have to be in the barn around back.", she says. 

"You okay Punch?", Leo asks, confused at my silence. 

"Yeah, just figuring things out. Horses are in a barn around back.", I answer. 

Mike is walking to window after window, looking for something. 

"She'll be here Michael. Calm down.", Demi assures him. 

"We can give her an hour. After that we need to move. Everyone, get patched up and whatever supplies you can find.", Leo says, matter-of-factly. 

I can tell Mike wants to argue, but we all feel it. The pressure, the sense of this being the final act in this horrorshow. 

We all prepare in our own ways, patching wounds, reloading weapons, or planning out what happens next. We're more than a team, we're family, we all know our role. 

The whistle cuts through the night. It's sound surely more than natural. 

I'm the first to the window, but soon everyone else follows. 

"Fuck me.", Leo says.

Outside the gate is what remains of Travis' forces. Most look injured, the crowd seems somewhat thinned, but it's still a well prepared and armed army. 

In the middle of the crowd, held down with ancient looking ropes that smoke and sear her skin, is Alex. She's surrounded by some of the most eclectic looking members of Travis' crew. She shimmers with binding energy. 

Flares shoot up from the crowd by the dozen, soon the mass of people is lit with harsh, pulsing red light. Travis stands at the head of the throng, grinning.  His voice cuts clear through the distance and night. 

"You guys ready to discuss things?", he says.

And with the enemy at the gates, Alex's fate in the balance, and the Bishop a stone's throw away, this is where I'm going to have to leave you this week. 

If anyone has an experience in negotiating with lunatics, let me know. 

Till then, i hope to talk to all of you again. 

Punch.


Looks like we survived another week
