“Elijah”

“Elijah, wake up” I heard it whisper to me.

“My name is Wærnæk, I am your friend”

“What are you?” I asked.

“I am an alp, This house used to be my home but the stupid humans… I mean my family didn’t want me anymore” Wærnæk said.

“Are you going to hurt me?” I asked.

I was really scared that night and while I heard its voice, I could not see it but I pretended I wasn’t scared.


“No, my friend,” it said.

Next morning I woke up covered in sweat. I felt exhausted and like I had no energy. Then I remembered, Wærnæk. 


That creature and I had a conversation and I got even more scared. It will come back when it's time to sleep.


As soon as I got up, I started googling things about this thing. Back then it was harder to find things online but I actually found something.

I found a page that had information about alps and other similar creatures. 


It had a drawn picture of what an alp could look like. 

“Alps are sinister creatures that play nice but steal your energy and wake you up at night” the page said.

It also said that the alps are evil and they will start to cause harm to you sooner or later. It depends on how you treat them.

There were instructions on how to stay safe from them and how to banish them from your home. 

The instructions were that you need to put a salt ring around your bed. Then you had to put raw fish in the corner as an offering. When the alp comes to eat that fish you have to tell him a riddle and if he fails he has to leave the house. If the alp gets it right you have one more chance to banish it the next night. Alps can’t resist riddles and offering him that fish makes it trust you. Alps know how they can be banished.


That night I did exactly what the instructions told me to do. First I put the salt ring around my bed, then I placed the fish in the corner. I even came up with a pretty smart riddle. 

The riddle was “What shows your reflection, but you can never touch it. It can burn or chill, yet it isn’t fire or ice.”

Pretty clever in my opinion. It was time to test it. 

While brushing my teeth I was getting nervous about what was going to happen. I was terrified of the creature. Would I even survive?


“Elijah, I’m back” it whispered.

I woke up and made a plan in my head. I had to talk to him nicely and offer him the fish in the corner.

“Hello, my friend. How are you today?” I answered. 

“Me? I’m fine,” it said

“How old are you?” I asked out of curiosity.

“I’m so old that I don’t even remember the exact number but around 150 years old” it rasped.

When we were having this conversation, Wærnæk didn’t whisper anymore. Its voice was low and raspy. 

“I thought I’d offer you something,” I said.

“Offer me something? There better not be any riddles involved,” It answered and grinned.

Wærnæks appearance seemed more sinister than before. It also looked a little bit bigger. 


“No riddles involved but before I give you the gift I want to ask you something,” I said.

“Go ahead, ask.” Wærnæk answered.

“What happened to your family?” I asked shakingly.

“It's a long story but I can shorten it. They were stupid and didn’t care about me. I loved them but they treated me like a dog. They told me they loved me but I just used them to live here and to feed on their emotions. I mean we had a really loving relationship with the kids at least. The adult never liked me,” It said with a bit of sadness in its voice.

“Alright, the offering is in that corner and it is a surprise!” I told him excitedly.

“What have you left me in the corner?” It said while crawling towards the fish.

“Raw fish, my favorite. How did you know?” It said.

“I just guessed and decided to try it out” I blurted out.

“You are so nice, maybe I won’t feed on your emotions anymore,” It said and chuckled.


Wærnak started munching on the fish and that’s when I blurted out the riddle. 

“It shows your reflection, but you can never touch it. It can burn or chill but it isn’t fire or ice. What am I?”


“You tricked me!”  It screamed. It’s voice echoed through the room.

Then it tried to attack me. It flew through the air, claws first. The claws were only inches away from my face. Then it stopped at once. It started sizzling and I smelt burning hair. It screamed in pain.

“You tricked me! How could you, I thought we were friends!” It screamed.

“So it seems. Now answer the riddle!” I said.

It repeated the riddle and wondered for a while. 

“You knew my weakness all along but the answer for your riddle must be, water” It said.

There was a moment of silence as that answer sunk in my head. He was right. 

“You are right.” I said anxiously. 

“Haha, you tried to trick me and you failed. You have one more try. If you want to get rid of me I suggest you make a hard riddle” It said and grinned. 

Then it disappeared and I was left there to think about a harder, better riddle.

I was scared to death about the upcoming night. I stressed myself out while figuring that riddle. If this would not work I’d be stuck sleeping in a salt ring. The thought of that annoyed me. 

I looked up more information about the alps and found out that they grow if you fear them and also once you trick them they will try everything to stop you from banishing them. The salt ring protects you from them feasting on your emotions. 

Then the night arrived. I had my riddle ready and the fish even though Wærnæk probably wouldn’t even touch it. 

“Hello, this time may be the last,” It whispered and appeared when the clock turned 3 am.

“If this is the last time. I want you to know that I can’t be banished forever. I will always come back” It added.

Wærnæk looked much bigger than the first time I saw it.

“Alright, if you survive this riddle.” I said while smirking. 

Here goes nothing I thought and said the riddle.

“Invisible and untouchable, I fill every breath. Without me, life ends. With too much, death. What am I?”

I said it and Wærnæk instantly started swearing. Wærnæk also looked really excited. 

“This is the hardest riddle anyone has told me,” He said.

It started pacing around and visibly had a hard time figuring out the riddle. 

“We don’t have all night to wait for your answer,” I said.

“You stupid human. We have many hours till sunrise and I will not lose to you,” It screamed

At this point Wærnæk was visibly angry and desperate to solve this riddle. I started taunting it.

“You can’t solve my riddle can you?” I taunted it.

“Shut up, I can and I will. I will not be bested by some low life human!” It yelled at me.

Wærnæk tried to figure it out for a while and all of a sudden, it started sizzling and burning. It started shrieking so loud that my ear drums almost popped. It sounded horrible and he was suffering. 

“I will come back to get you!” It shrieked

Then it was just gone. After what felt like an hour I fell asleep.

Wærnæk has not appeared since. I think I got rid of him for good but I can’t be sure. Its last words still haunt me to this day and the salt I used is still in a jar under my bed.
