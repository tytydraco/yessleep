 

So to preface this I live in a rural area with a lot of woods around me. There is this local legend that the woods in our area are the host to some deep form of evil and I’ve heard a lot of teenagers and even some of the adults talk about how if you look for long enough you will start to see random gates that do not belong.

The story goes that each one you walk through will make more more of these strange events happen and after you walk through the 7th gate, (this is where the stories differ) some say that you will be transported to hell, some say it will bring some terrible event to happen in your life and some people say it’s just BS. My friend Jack and I were the latter.

One weekend we were sitting in my room and it was one of those days where we couldn’t think of anything to do.

“Hey, what if we go to the woods and see if we can find one of the gates to hell?” I suggested, half as a joke, just to see what Jack would think. 

He chuckled before saying, “Shit, why not, there’s nothing else to do today.”

We went outside and grabbed our bikes and set off down the road. It was about a 5 minute ride down our street until we reached the trails that led to the woods. Once we made it to the end of the trail we could no longer ride our bikes so we ditched them and took off on foot. 

“So, what now?” Jack asked, looking around with a puzzled expression. 

“I don’t really know, I guess we just walk around and look for anything out of place.” I responded.

We started walking further into the woods trying to find anything of interest. We had been walking for what felt like forever and the whole area had a slightly unnerving feel.

Jack broke the silence stating, “Dude, I think we should head back.”

I didn’t respond and for some reason took a couple more steps forward before seeing something in the distance. 

“Jack… look. I think I see a gate,” 

He was completely silent and we walked forwards . There was definitely a wooden gate, but it was small and not like the huge, ornate, metal gate that I pictured. The gate was still weird though, it was probably a mile into the woods and there is no logical reason for a standalone gate to be there. 

“Huh, I didn’t actually expect to see anything,” Jack said surprised.

“Let’s walk through it,” I laughed and started to run towards it. Jack was reluctant for a second but followed me. 

As I got close I got this strange feeling like I shouldn’t be here, but I chalked it up to just being in my head and walked through the gate anyways, Jack was right behind me and passed through the gate as well. 

“I wonder what else is out here? Let’s keep going”

Jack agreed and we continued walking. We’d walked another 10 minutes before something started happening, every minute or two a twig would snap or it would sound like someone took a step in our immediate vicinity. We figured it was an animal because every time we heard it, it was in a completely different spot. As soon as this started I was beginning to get pretty creeped out and from Jack's face it seemed like he was too.

“Hey, you wanna head back home and do something else?” I said, trying not to sound like a complete wimp. 

“Yeah man, this is starting to weird me out, and I’m sure it’s all fake anyways. We turned and started walking the way we came, now this is where it starts to get weird. I’m 100 percent sure that we are going in the direction that we came from and we had been walking for longer than when we entered the forest and yet I saw nothing recognizable. 

“Do you have any idea where we are going? This is the way we came, right?”

“Yes, I’m sure this is the way we came, something’s really off about this.”

Jack looked like he was starting to freak out a little and I was on the verge as well. We just keep treading the way we came, maybe our time perception was off or something. That’s when we saw the second gate. Of course at this point I had no desire at all to walk through another one of these, but it was like it was pulling me towards it, it took all my mental effort to not sprint through the gate, I could tell Jack was experiencing the same feeling. As we passed by it, I had this unshakable feeling that I was doing something terrible, I literally almost threw up at this point. As we made it further from the gate, the feeling gradually got better, but merely seconds after the feeling passed these hushed whispers began. They were constant but unintelligible. We were basically running at this point and starting to panic, we saw another gate and a sense of dread hit me like a train. The whispers turned into screams, I felt like my ears would rupture with the volume. 

GO THROUGH THE GATE… GO THROUGH THE GATE!!!

Over and over in my head, the pain was excruciating. Feeling as if I had no other choice I bolted for the gate and as soon as I made it through I collapsed but the voices suddenly vanished, as if they were never there. I just sat there for a minute trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Jack fell to the ground next to me.

“I’m sorry man, I never should have gotten us into this, I thought it was just a myth.” I said trying to keep it together.

“It’s alright, I didn’t believe it either. I don’t think we have a choice to leave anymore, we have to go through all the gates.

“I think so too. I just hope whatever happens when we make it through all 7, isn’t worse than this.”

With that we both stood up, and began to move with a newfound burst of energy. We planned on getting through the gates quickly so this would all be over. Within a couple minutes we made it to the third gate and passed through with no problems. 

After the 3rd Gate: The temperature dropped to nearly freezing and the subtle whispers returned. 

After the 4th gate:  We heard the steps and rustling from earlier yet this time we saw dark figures just watching us, yet no matter how hard I looked at them I couldn’t see any defining features. 

After the 5th gate: Now there were dozens of the shadow looking people watching us from all around and they began this rhythmic laughing that was barely discernible and very low pitched. 

After the 6th Gate: The temperature suddenly shifted from freezing to uncomfortably warm and after a few minutes we were both sweating. The shadow figures were still watching but now they were shuffling around and following behind us. 

We were approaching the 7th gate and hesitation set in. We realized the possibilities of what could happen and I looked back at Jack wondering if there was any other way out, he looked around and we were 

surrounded by the dark figures and had nowhere to go even if we wanted to. He nodded and I took the final step into the 7th gate.

Everything went silent. As if someone hit the mute button on the entire forest. 

“Did we make it?” Jack whispered.

Before I could respond, one of the shadow-like figures from before stepped in front of us but it was over 10 feet tall and looked to have smoky horns sticking out from its head. 

It began to speak in a booming voice yet it had no face or mouth to show that it was speaking.

“Welcome… we haven’t had visitors for quite a while,” 

I spoke shakily, “Where are we? We just wanna go home,”

The creature chuckled, “We are everywhere and nowhere at once. This is the pace in between what some humans call heaven and hell.”

Jack spoke this time, “Just please let us out of here, we didn’t know any of this was real!”

We couldn’t tell because expressionless is an understatement for this guy, but he seemed to be pondering and made an audible Hmm . 

“Most people come here for power or some form of reward but I can tell that your intentions are pure. I will give you a way out. The souls trapped here rarely get any form of entertainment so I propose a simple game. All you must do is reach the gate over there and outrun these hopeless souls and you will be safe.”

This time when I looked at the gate it was like how I pictured. It was a looking black tinted metal gate. Ornate golden accents lined the metal and large torches hung lit from it. It stood around what I could guess was 150 feet away from us. 

“Are you ready? Do you accept these terms?” The creature asked.

Jack and I locked eyes, and nodded.

“Let’s do this,” I said.

“GO,” The dark figure yelled. 

As he said that he evaporated into a cloud of smoke and Jack and I took off, faster than we’ve ever run before. 

The imprisoned souls began running from behind us and from the sides of us, attempting to cut us off. I gave a one second glance to the side to see them running so unnaturally, it was disturbing how inhuman they were. We both were hyper focused on the gate pushing with everything we had to make it. We were so close, another 15 seconds and we’d be home. Safe.

I heard a thud and looked back to see Jack had tripped onto the ground. I stopped and started to turn to help him. The creatures were only seconds behind him and had caught up as soon as he fell, piling on top of him. A writhing mass of these monsters trapped him and all I could do was watch as they started to bite and dig into Jacks flesh.

Jack looked at me and meekly whispered, “Run” 

I wanted to stay and fight them off but I knew we would both be lost here forever. I turned and I ran. I heard his screams piercing my ears but I didn’t look back, I knew I wouldn’t be able to bear the sight if I did. I closed the last couple feet between the gate and ran through it. I fell to the ground and everything went black.

When I woke up I was back at the start of the path where we had stashed our bikes. Where it all had started.

Every since it happened, I’ve been having nightmares and have an almost crippling feeling of guilt every day about Jack. I’ve been thinking about going back, and seeing if I can rescue Jack or at the very least get revenge. Next time I will be prepared and I definitely won’t be bringing anyone with me. If I do go back wish me luck, and if I make it I will update. 

I want to be clear about why I wrote this.This is a warning, don’t mess with forces you don’t understand, and do not EVER pass through any gates in the woods…
