A bunch of you have kids right? Or will have kids? Please keep them close, and safe, when there are foxes around.

I was 6 when I met it; a talking fox, straight out of a fairytale. Yep- magic is real, and it sucks.

It was the summer of 1982 and parents had rented a house in the countryside, and I was bored out of my mind. I spent most of my time playing in the backyard. Thats how I met the Fox, who calmly explained he had 'only intruded upon our yard in order to sample the delectable treats contained within thine waste disposal'. It had an 'old timey' manner of speech, and bowed its head politely as it noticed me.

'I am Mr Fox, of Foxes Den- and who mightest thou be young sir?'

Thinking back, there was always something disingenous about its veneer of gentility. Sweetest smile holds sharpest tooth after all.
I was only a small boy though, far too stupid to see the predatory gleam in its eye.

The fox suggested that we should play together, albeit

'- at a fair distance from thine parents watchful gaze, lest they misinterpret our friendship'

I was a bit wary at first, but we compromised by playing behind some bushes in the yard. The bushes were tall, and thick- quite ideal for obscuring my parents line of sight.

As we played Mr Fox would tell the most enchanting stories of his home in the woods, and how much fun was to be had in its surroundings.

'Verily, Foxes Den is the most excellent abode, and the grounds are rich with entertainment. Foxes, you understand have no bedtime, and we play and imbibe as we please. Only a fortnight ago didst I liberate a large package of expensive chocolates- sweet to the taste indeed, albeit the packaging is not as amenable to my teeth as I wouldst prefer. Wouldst that I had fingers like thine own, young master!'

Mr Fox, you see, had candy in his den. If I would only come with him I could have some. Sounds legit right? Nothing shady at all.

If only I had known then what I know now.

It took Mr Fox only a few weeks to convince me to escape the confines of the backyard, and follow him to Foxes Den.

The Den wasnt what I would have expected. It didnt look magical, just a narrow hole in the ground. Mr Fox noticed my expression and laughed.

'The magic is inside young master. Crawl insidd yonder hole and thou wilst see the wonders of Foxes Den.'

I crawled inside. It was just wide enough for me to get into the hole. Its sides were wet, muddy, slick and as the initally mild slope suddenly became far more precipitous I started sliding. I cried out in shock.

Then the pain began. The sides of the hole suddenly felt less like mud than jagged rock. I felt my skin tear as I kept sliding, a sharp pain encompassing my whole body. I felt a pungent stench of iron, and other body fluids besides, as I reached the end of the hole and collapsed onto the filthy, shit, blood and bone soaked floor of a tiny cave- Foxes Den. 

I screamed, and screamed; my whole body was a sickening red colour, and seeping blood. I could see my muscles, evident in my flayed state. There were clumps of white, bulbous goo as well- remaining bits of subcutaneous fat. Everything hurt, and the slightest movement exacerbated the pain a thousand times. Do you think there are limits to pain? Think again!

Something wet and slick lay crumpled next to me- my skin I realized as I looked at my own collapsed and deflated face.

Mr Fox arrived in the den through the same hole that I did. He didnt look much like a fox anymore- he too had been flayed by the hole. A foxes pelt snagged his feet as the monstrous thing rose to its hindlegs.

I got to see him wrap himself in my skin. I saw how it wrapped around him, contorting his bones and muscles as it did. I lay, gasping in pain as I saw Mr Fox become me.
He walked over with a cruel, vulpine smile. His human hands gripped the discarded foxes' pelt.

'Dont worry buddy. You'll be alright. Ya just need some new skin, ya dig?'

He didnt sound 'old- timey' anymore. Well he did, but more 1950s than 1850s. He wrapped my flayed, pathetic form in the cold pelt. The pain was immense- I felt the skin *grow into* me. My body contorted, my bones cracking and reshaping to fit its new skin. My teeth all but shot out of my jaw as new sharper teeth tore through my gums. At some point I soiled myself.

I lay whimpering as Mr Fox, looking like I had only hours ago, crawled out of the den. I never saw him again.

I spent 33 years as a fox. Believe me when I tell you its not an existence I would wish on anyone. I was always cold, and always hungry. I slept in a damp hole in the ground. At best my meals would be raw and bloody; at worst rotten and magott- riddled.

I was always alone, loved by no one in the entire world. That, I think, was the worst part. I learnt to fear humans; if you've felt the sting of buckshot once you're not eager to feel it again.

I tried reaching out to people- in earnestness at first. Adults, I found, could not understand me. Children could, but were unable to offer help beyond occasionally giving me snacks. 
And then they went back to their warm and cozy rooms, their toys, their abundant meals and their loving families. And I went back to my damp, cold and lonely den. 

How was that fair?

It was in 2015 that I finally found a child stupid enough to follow me back to my den. She thought I had a 'tablet' there- her parents had restricted her screentime you see. 
Well, she's not worried about screentime anymore. 

I put the skin on her of course; Maybe it would have been more merciful to just let her die in her flayed state, but I have a feeling I would not have liked the outcome. She's Mr Fox now, unless she's tricked some other idiot child by now. Regardless I guarantee that the current Mr Fox is actively looking for his next unsuspecting victim.

I would not have picked a girls skin if I had options, but beggars cant be choosers. I was just glad to be human again. Going through the wrong puberty sucked, especially since my new parents, being quite conservative, refused to let me get puberty blockers. Gender dysphoria is not as bad as being a fox though, and I'll be 18 soon anyway. I, frankly, cant wait. Hopefully college will be better than high school. Maybe I'll transition? I havent decided yet. The thing that *really* bothers me is may hair- I'm a redhead now, and I have had quite enough of that for several lifetimes. I'm definitely dyeing it when I move out.

I looked up my old self- he ended up dead from a drug overdose back in 2001. He weighed like 400 pounds too. Apparently spending *who- knows* how many years as a fox isnt great for your impulse control. My old parents are still around, and have had two more kids. I have thought about reaching out but, frankly, what would be the point?

So to summarize: Dont let your kids out of your sight. Dont let them play with foxes. Or, and I dont know how common this is, what comes back may not be your kid. Mr Fox is still out there, waiting for someone to take his place. 

Please let him wait forever.
