Our new doctor came in quicker than anyone had expected. Barely had the time to confirm Hannah’s text in our little trailer sized domicile when I had noticed a perennial little shadow at the edge of my door’s little peep window. 

How strange? I wondered silently with the closing of my eyes, a sigh to prepare myself and the brushing of my hand on the grip of my revolver. Dem nerds from China had quite clever ways of working their ways through all avenues of science and technology, but nobody had expected them to work this fast! 

As much as I had been rattled, a guest was still a guest. This down South in America meant that you were entitled some Southern hospitality no matter you’re from, or at the very least some kindness by the lady that you were supposed to work with on account of your handler being restricted by the inner machinations of international bureaucracy. 

Hand still wrapped ‘round the wooden grip of my revolver, I got up from the dim warmth of my bedroom and started walking through the “girlrotten” mess of my home to peek through the foggy peephole. The new doctor hadn’t even bothered to knock on the door, holler, or be anything close to welcoming. 

And I meant that in the most literal sense. People like me don’t have the luxury of being cosmetically judgmental. So I’ll assume the descriptions alone would be enough to do their job.
 
Pitch black eyes that glittered under the streetlamp’s amber din like a hungry fruit-fly’s circling tantalising rotten cactus fruit. Skin whose pallor resembled those of a corpse at the undertaker’s. Lips pursed so tightly that it may have as well been a straight line.

I don’t know how long we stood staring at each other through the peephole. But it was long enough that her lovely little compounds transitioned into lazily shaded black once I took my fifth blink in an unspoken staring contest. It was strange how she never really asked to let herself in but ‘em Chinese had tons of weird customs so at the time I thought it to be just another rule of giving courtesy to the homeowner. 

Or sumfin like that. Hannah was the exotic local from those parts while I was born and raised on the rez. Never been overseas beyond continental lines and maybe a few trips to see some friends down the border. 

I wouldn’t have admitted to her face but even now I don’t think I could accurately see the difference between Korean and Japanese script. It also took Hannah too long to realise that we don’t build totem poles in the desert so in some comically offensive sense it makes us even. 

But this insistence to cultural norms even as the harsh desert winds blew across the night was a bit absurd! It’s only logical for the human body to self preserve by seeking shelter, same for an animal. So what was the matter with this new doctor? 

Well shit. As much as I’d love to let the doctor stand on my porch all night hospitality was still hospitality, folk ‘ere have unspoken rules of their own. You gonna obey em for “social capital” but I don’t like it when Hannah speaks all fancy ‘bout humane things. I prefer believing in being kind for its own sake. 

Against my basal instincts I would sigh, then open up the door with my left hand. The one not grasping on the grip of my revolver.

“Howdy Missus.” I greet them with an appraising look. Hoping that my not very rugged attire of pyjamas wouldn’t make me look like a wimp. 

The smaller woman in front of me was dressed fairly strangely for the part. Black sweater worn underneath a pristine white lab-coat and black trousers over heeled boots. 

In her hands was a shiny Taehyung smartwatch. State of the art and the very latest in model, definitely very expensive. 

Contrasted highly with the real worn down leather bag that looked like one of the old timey antiques from Doc Randall’s office. Looking more like a period piece than one of my own good pieces if you catch mah drift. 

“How-die?” The doctor tilted her head. Quickly she would open up her bag with her own hands and reach in. Pulling out an unmarked black notebook and then frowning.
I give her some time to read up. 

Rectangular phone in her trousers gave me the impression that she had a good sense of tech along with fancy smart glasses. No idea why the doctor had to use something this old school in the modern age.

But I like it. We’re already warmin up! 
“My name is Dr. Yui’ani. I am being hosted from Xi’an, China. I currently work at Jiaotong University and am on a research trip to Pyramid Lake. Recommended to the United States Anomalous Firewatch Service on the behest of Dr. Hannah Zhou(Phd).” 

You ever know how a robot talks? Not the ones from Transformers or the Terminator. But from one of ‘em analog horrors where the characters face down screeching abominations derived from meme culture that communicates in text to speech syllables that have been audibly blasted at the highest volume. 

Like that one particular creepy voice from the EAS sirens.

Just modulated by whatever forces deigning Yui into being pitch perfect. But I couldn’t shake off the the strange pronunciation of the latter parts of her name, so foreign to my tongue that upon silently mouthing it, I found myself slipping into the tones I used for my own half dead tongue. 

Different from english in how the syllables were dragged out rather than pronounced practically. Yet similar to the curt tones of Mandarin like a blend of all three languages.  

“Yeah, I think I getcha.” Who was I to bother delving into such casual matters? The language of a warm welcome transcends any barrier. “My girlfriend told me all about you. Come in.”

I allow the good doctor into my home while locking the door behind us. To her credit Yui was a really convenient house guest who left her spotless shoes outside of the doors. Prefer that cultural tidbit to my old home’s, lesser muck to clean off. 

“Oh?” She quizzically whispered upon looking up at the roof of my container. Frowned to herself like she had encountered a hundred piece puzzle and then stepped inside. Hands grasping my doorknob in nauseating confusion like the Vietnam War OGs who always needed help scaling down the stairs at the nearby VA. 

“Oh! It’s very curiously sized?!” Could not figure out whether Yui was shocked, terrified or thrilled the same way one would be if they stepped off a rollercoaster. 

Tenderly pushing aside a solitary left sock from the couch’s leftmost crevice(finally found it!), Yui immediately lowered her case right in front of the couch and then took her seat. Staring out into the blank screen with a frown, yet another quizzical head tilt forming up. Somehow looking both stupefied and bewildered at the same time. 

—-

I had left Dr. Yui there for about fifteen mikes to pour some cheap long island ice tea. Homemade from ingredients I had bought off from Buck-E’s during last month’s trip, could never really replicate the ones from Vegas yet. But I’m getting way closer. Sliding over a glass whose bottom was still covered in last week’s alcoholic gunk, I made sure to motion for Yui to have a sip as we both sat down to stare at the empty TV.

No hope in turning it on even as Yui frowned her perfectly cut brows. Her compounds glancing towards the mess of old school antennae I had never really bothered to untangle from newer cables from the brand new TV box Hannah had bought. 

Wires had almost consumed this corner of the house as some snaked upwards to the radar antennae outside the container and to the power-lines below. One important wire leading to the dusty DVD player I used for rewatching the old laserdiscs dad had borrowed me. 

“There’s a button y’know? Fancy places like yours don’t cater to retro tastes?” I asked while getting up and flicking the plastic ON button with an echoey click after brushing aside the Xbox controller. Then I picked up the remote from its drawer and headed back to the couch since I didn’t want to upgrade to an all digital setup. 

Times were always a’changing but can’t a nostalgic countryside gal stick to the classics?

“My folly!” Yui hissed again with a chittering that left quite a raw aftertaste in my ears. Weirdly ringing it a little but that could just be from the tinnitus after helping out the boys back in the ‘stan.

“The brainial box wasn’t turned on! I tried to communicate since I saw the antennae but it wasn’t listening despite the reservoirs of charged electrons surging through!”

“Yeah. Dumbass Hannah forgot to switch off the socket again. Not everything is a Samsung Smart Fridge y’know? Why did I even spend so much on that?” 

“It’s a good appliance. Keeps my salads cold.” 

“Salads?! Hah! Thought you were a sushi gal!” I smacked Yui in the back whilst guffawing through the unearthly feeling of rigid carapace behind fine cloth and rubbery skin. Some part of Yui’s spinal cords was definitely interlinked like the tracks of an Abrams tank with the sleekness of a cockroach’s wing. 

“You need some venison! Adds meat to your bones!”

“Venison? What manner of meal is that?”

“Just something thats real gnarly. Not clean like your clothes.”

Yui tilts her head whilst keeping bizarre eyes on Fox News’ latest reports on all the mysterious happenings on the woods. Latest anchor-man has been yapping incessant about space lizards coming and ruining all American woods as they please. Interesting theory that was ruined only because they were correct about the woods being fiddled by an unknown force. 

“What's wrong with my clothes?”

“You came to the middle of Nevada, gal! Ankle deep in Paiute country where the plains are so dusty that grains of sand stick to you like the buzzards of my namesake! Only way you could stay this clean is as if you came down from a damned flying saucer!”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about. I just came from home.” The ringing in my ears and the chittering again. No shock this time, maybe just a morsel of panic? Panic at me? Nah. I’m just a washup country hero who spends her days babysitting dumbfuck tourists in the woods. 

Panic at greater forces? More inclined to believe that!
But it was a strangely welcome thought to be feared for once. 

“Home? Not a single speck of dust on your boots nor any sign of vehicle transmission? No trucks. Don’t see you with any tickets nor passport either.” I smirk knowingly like I was laying down a bad hand after getting ‘ol Smithee to fold last week. “Gal? You must’ve thought that I was born yesterday!” 

Yui winced. Panicking like a scared rescue as she quickly reached for her brown doctor’s bag. Clutching it tightly until she finds her notebook to leaf through all the wayward, multicoloured spirals scribbled within. 

Shit that made my head hurt like I was playing an old arcade game with ‘em spaceships and the fed conspiracy. 

“Relax! If I cared about persecuting every illegal I meet on patrol my truck would be full all ta time. Its oka-“

“I came here by aircraft!” Yui shouted. A buzzing cacophony’s worth of flies screaming from behind that pale throat as a sense of sheer panic drifted underneath my tongue? 

Huh! 

Tastes like the first bite of datura. Now that was something truly eldritch, something I hope never to try outside of rituals. 

“Of course you came from an aircraft. What about your home?”

The television flickered offline with the brief flash of a pale white planet whose sterile ground was decorated by sprawling, gloomy cities of 40k styled hive-sprawl that reared straight up into its lower atmosphere. Their spires barely reaching the lower columns of grand altars to the vast depths of inhumane inf-

“IN THE SKY!” Yui yelled again. The television’s antennae letting out a teeny crackle of gloomy purple-electric blue lighting as its antennae warped itself much like a peeling banana. 
The chattering came back with a vengeance, as if a hurling screaming display of fear masked beneath a threat display as I leaned back and laughed.

If I was some pasty intellectual from the bayside cities and their quirky universities I would’ve been spewing my guts in terror of such an ominous intruder. Such an obvious invader from quite possibly a distant world just barging into my home.

But I had seen it all before on deployment. That man with a pierced earlobe whom we had to screen on checkpoint Romeo after we remembered that locals don’t go about their business with such body mods. Poor guy was screeching so hard that he was born in San Fran as an American with rights, partially hoping that the raw desperation in his voice would convince us of his innocence yet not wanting to just break down and beg in front of his waiting insurgent buddies. Fear and desperation masked behind a whirlwind of vulgar threats.

Never knew what happened to him after I drove him off back to our FOB. Sure hope he ain’t doing so good since there are few reasons why a man from home would end up deep in the ‘stan. He wasn’t one of our guys, sure as shit ain’t an aid worker either. 
Leaves either a Taliban sympathiser or a journo and we sure as shit saw no press that day.

Didn’t bother asking the spooks.
That why I ain’t afraid. Just sat next to Yui until she cooled down from her little meltdown and we continued watching TV as the night went on. Fox got too fanciful for my tastes so we swapped to some videos of Paiute history from the local museums’ Youtube channel. 

Watching that made me think of how I survived those longer nights out in the ‘stan. A desert was still a desert right? No matter the plains of home nor the burning sands out there…shit, a real intellectual can prosey on and on about the varied differences of biodiversity, humidity and cultural behaviours which I get it. 

I wrote such essays for my classes in university. But once you understand that a pickup truck driving, bearded man with a gun and a blessing from God was still the same no matter where they were on Earth, you’re a quarter done to obtaining all you needed to know to survive. 

Anything more knowledge was just unnecessary. 

And shit. Like? What was the actual difference from people like Yui and Hannah? Both of em are aloof nerds with dark hair from strange worlds so very far away from flyover America. 

Yet it was Hannah, the human woman rather than the possible extraterrestrial who’d be more likely to get weird stares while walking down the hood near Vegas. 

Gotta have to cooperate to fix what's happening to the rez. Alien or foreigner ain’t no different once you think down the right mental ladders. Both deserve hospitality no matter what they are. 

So we both sat there. And watched history. And relaxed until the sun came up.

It was fine, really. We needed all the chill before the pain really starts.
