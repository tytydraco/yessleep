The story I'm about to tell is about obsession a obsession with a idea a obsession a hobby a conspiracy that lasted three years 

  I was always tall for my age most my family was Wich really sucked because I was a attractive girl in my opinion but never had much luck with guys when I was in school I had two one in pre school which I guess doesn't count and one when I was 14 but i was ok with that when I was 12 i was 5 foot 7 taller than all the girls in my class I had brown hair and hazel eyes and round orange glasses Which I thought were  iconic and matched my dorky positive personality I forcefully exuded on this particular day I remember because I got to wear my favorite favorite t-shirt it was a warm August day in 1979 so I try to wear white clothes so i wouldn't be that hot it had the logo of a local rock band called the grim smile me and my friend Samantha loved the band 

Especially the song sweat mystery I can still remember us arguing about what the lyrics of the song she was good to arguing which was a surprise because she was very very shy she was a short Ginger girl with with curly hair I think when Chris says no one could find him high in the mountains and nobody will look for him in the morning shows that the character he sings about is like us people in the background your most definitely Rong sam I say with my usuall smile sam always said stuff like that thinking it was deep it literally just means he got away with the crime I look over at sam and she looks past me i quickly look over and a tall  boy with blond hair wearing a plain green teshirt throws awkward jazz hands at me scaring the shit out of me even though I knew he was there hahaha that's what you get for saying nerd shit the little ginger girl looks at him in disgust at the vulgar word he just said I look at Chris and then look at sam then I look ahead at the messy streets of Water loo Iowa

 guys don't argue we are almost to my cousins we walked another block and erived In front of two houses both notable they are both White and look identical the only difference is one was my house and one was my cousin's house me and my three friends have been walking in circles just around the block like we usually did it was a routine that we did at least four times a week and we always ended up at my cousin's house the 6'3 brown-haired Hazel eyed boy walked out of the house he was about 16 at this time he was wearing a a yellow Hawaiian shirt and khaki shorts he Cooley walks over to us and gives his routine high fives before he says ready to go Chris looks at him with his usual naive but mischievous glimmer in his eyes and says no shot why do you think we walked here the tall boy wearing a Hawaiian shirt responds no clue but I know I'm going to your mom's house later both boys laugh the only reason Chris hung out with us was cuz of Tommy and the only reason me and Sam hug out with them was free ice cream they messed around for a minute well me and Sammy stood there awkwardly and then we all turned around as a boy wearing all black walked out of the house

 the boy was 14 at the time and probably about 6 ft 1 with room to grow in the future I'm sure you guessed by now but he's related to me he had brown hair like me and my cousin and hazel eyes the only difference is he was pale looked like he had been outside for months and it was probably the truth he liked staying in his room in his room with his odd hobbies and interests the malnourished boy didn't say anything he just stood there his black hoodie making him a the fourth smudge in a painting of white houses even his own sibling looked at him in amazement surprised he came out of his room little ginger girl dressed in purple shivered and slight fear as the air intensifies her nose twitching a bit me and Chris quickly recovered the situation the glow return to his eyes and my usual smile extended to its normal curve we both began inquiring on if the boy would be coming with us to the ice cream parlor he shook his head yes like I said most of what you heard was normal routine for us but not this this was different this never happened never ever ever in the 3 months that that we've been doing this Sammy would later say the song sweat mystery when she saw him

We all got quietly into Tommy's car after hell had froze I quickly put my smile and looked over at sam as i did earlier I can't Wait to get ice cream the message was aimed at Sammy who I knew wanted to get out of the the slim white car do to the darkness that was in the vehicle Chris quickly noticed my action and jokingly said she's probably getting postasheo her nose twitches and in a reasonable tone she squeaks not in your life I continue with the banter or rum raisin she squeaks again no she starts to sound annoyed now what flavor are you getting strawberry she says like her secret being exposed four laughs echo through the car followed by a fifth disingenuous laugh just when i forgot he was in the car

Chris speaks up hey man can you not be creepy the darkly dressed boy turns towards him and finally speaks what do you mean Chris responds with just like try act normal the boy responds with nobody's normal Chris looks at me confused Tommy speaks up he means try to be a little friendlier you know a little less antisocial you act like John Wayne gacy murdered your family Chris and Tommy laugh but the boy didn't take it that way his eyes turn to anger he looks like he's about to bite somebody he jumps at Tommy choking him out Tommy swerves on the road almost hitting a car Chris and I literally have to dig into his hands and unlatch them from his throat the boy says in a crying voice John Wayne gacy was a genius his work can never be recreated you put respect on his name you can hear the anger in his voice and Can tell this is the loudest it's ever gotten since he was a baby Tommy pulls over to catch his breath and the boy gets out and takes off be all sit there and amazement and bewilderment at the site we just witnessed Sam started crying and we tried our best to calm her down call me immediately called the cops and his parents telling them I about the situation

A few hours later after talking to the cops Samantha's parents pick her up and me Chris and Tommy continue on to the ice cream place it was in a mall be parked a few blocks away and slowly walked to the ice cream place silently the three of us walking side to side Chris speaks up what the fuck just happened Tommy responds with I don't I don't fucking know I mean I knew he was a little bit crazy and I knew about his current obsession you know with that serial killer but I didn't know you know oh my God he has pictures of the sick fuck on  his wall 

This wasn't the obsession that would make my life a living hell for 3 years but this is the first I truly realized the deep disturbance in my cousin's head I'm sorry I would type more of the story but there's more to tell and I don't frankly want to continue I guess good night for now
