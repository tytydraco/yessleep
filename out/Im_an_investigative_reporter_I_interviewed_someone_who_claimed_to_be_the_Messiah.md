I’m an investigate reporter for a New York paper. We are often derided to as a tabloid, but I’d dispute that. It’s true we report on a lot of celebrity gossip, but we do some good old-fashioned investigative journalism as well. Personally, I’ve reported on corruption within the NYPD, a bribery scandal in the New York State Legislature, and a Mafia-linked murder of the president of the longshoremen’s union. 

Two weeks ago, I was going through the tip submissions, when I saw one titled ‘Rabbi claims he has met the Messiah.’ Normally, this would be too tabloidy for us, but I recognized the rabbi’s name: Chaim Povarsky, the leader of an ultra-Orthodox Haredi Jewish sect based in Rockland County, about an hour’s drive north of the city. If he actually claimed to have met the Messiah, that would be something which we could report on. Not that I believed he did, but a headline like ‘Prominent rabbi claims the Messiah has returned!’ would sell papers and generate clicks like nothing else. 

I was skeptical that the rabbi even claimed that, and even more skeptical that if he did, that he would grant me an interview. Not only was the Haredi community very insular, I wasn’t popular with them. A decade back, I had done a story on exposing welfare fraud in Rabbi Povarsky’s community, where many couples, while being married in a synagogue, would never register their marriage with the state, allowing them to collect more in government benefits. During the course of that investigation I’d received massive volumes of hate mail, death threats, and even had a Molotov cocktail thrown through my bedroom window. Although Rabbi Povarsky wasn’t implicated in the scheme, I doubted he was a fan of mine. Still, I decide to pursue the tip. 

I searched to see if there had been any other reports of the rabbi’s claim. I couldn’t find any; the last mention of him was from the summer of 2020, when tens of thousands of mourners flooded the streets of Brooklyn, in violation of Covid restrictions, for the funeral of his brother, another beloved rabbi. Using my paper’s contacts, I managed to get in contact with him. He confirmed that he had met the Messiah, and agreed to sit down for an interview.

I made the drive to the rabbi’s Hudson Valley village, an enclave which was nearly all Haredi. According to the Census Bureau, it was one of the poorest towns in America, with most of its populace on welfare. Driving through it, you’d have no idea of its putative poverty. There were no homeless, no slums. The houses weren’t the McMansions you’d find in some New York suburbs, but they were decently kept up. 

I found the rabbi’s house, which was an actual mansion, and rang the doorbell. Immediately an elderly man opened it, wearing the Haredi uniform of a black suit, black hat, and white shirt. 

“I’m honored to be in your presence, Rabbi Povarsky,” I said, extending my hand.

He neither took my hand or greeted me, but bid me to follow him. He led me to a library, filled floor to ceiling with thousands of leather-bound volumes, and motioned for me to sit down. 

“Are you honored?,” he finally said. “After what you’ve published about my community, it seems that you, like most of the world, hate us. We are hated in Israel and we are hated in America, and not only by the *goyim*.  Our harshest critics come from within the Jewish community. We are called a cult, called misogynists, called extremists. Haredim have been vilified, by people like you.”

“I’m very sorry, that was not my intention.”

“Is that so? Let me ask you something, are you Jewish?”

“I’m an atheist.”

“That was not an answer to my question. Your mother was Jewish, was she not.”

“She was not raised Jewish, but yes, her mom was born into a Jewish family. And yes, I know that makes me Jewish according to you.”

“It Is not according to me, it is a fact. For you have a Jewish soul. I could sense that the moment you walked in. You may deny it, but that does not change the truth. And yet, despite that, or perhaps in spite of it, you have been writing about my community, our community, for your entire career. Now, have you ever worn *tefillin*?” 

I shook my head. I had often been stopped on the street by members of the Chabad movement, another Hassidic group, a group much more worldly than Rabbi Povarsky’s, but had always politely declined. But if this is what it would take to get an interview, I’d agree.

He strapped the black leather boxes on me and recited the *Shema* prayer with me. After he removed them, he stared at me vacantly.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “I have forgotten why you are here. And who you are.”

“I’m a reporter. I’ve heard you have been in contact with the Messiah,” I said. “Is that true?”

“Yes, I have been in contact with the *Moshiach*.”

“Is he here, in New York?”

“He is.”

“Was he born here?”

The rabbi nodded.

“Isn’t the Messiah prophecized to be born in Israel?”

“There is no such prophecy. He is required to be a scion of the House of David.”

“How do you know he is the Messiah? Has he performed miracles?”

“There is no requirement that he perform miracles. He has not walked on water, or raised the dead. But in one way, he has performed a miracle. I am 94 years old. I am considered one of the most preeminent authorities on *Halakha*. For 16 hours a day I study. My knowledge of the Talmud is unsurpassed. My expertise on *Kabbalah* is unmatched. Except by him, a young man of 20. When I was four, I was written up in the *Times*. They called me a savant for I had memorized the entire Torah. That was not a miracle. For the key to Judaism is not memorizing, like it is for the Mohammedans, but understanding. A computer can memorize, but it cannot understand even the simplest concepts. This man, his depth of understanding surpasses mine. According to tradition the *Moshiach’s* wisdom will surpass Solomon’s. And his surely does. That is a miracle.”

“Is he a yeshiva student? Is that how you know him?”

“He is not.” 

“How did you meet him?”

“That is unimportant, what is important is that he will rebuild the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, ushering in the Messianic Era.”

“Where is this man, can I meet him?”

“No, he will reveal himself next *Yom Kippur*.”

“Have you actually met this man. In person, I mean?” I had a theory that someone was taking advantage of the senile rabbi, emailing him, pretending to be the Messiah. 

“I have. In his cave?” 

“He lives in a cave?”

“That is what I just said.” He took out his cell phone, clearly bored with my questions.

“So you know he’s the Messiah because of his wisdom, his knowledge?” 

“More than that.”

“Can you please explain.”

“Please excuse me, I’m going to pay a visit to the restroom,” he said, leaving his cell phone on the coffee table between us.

When he was out of sight, I picked it up. 4 digit passcode. I tried to think of a number with some significance, but after coming up empty, I tried 1-1-1-1. Nope. 1-2-3-4. I was in! A breach of journalistic ethics, but I had to make a living. I opened up his texts. Most, as I should have suspected, were in Yiddish or Hebrew, two languages which I didn’t know. 

I had another idea. I opened up his maps app. Under his history, there was a visit to a state park about 30 minutes away. I heard his footsteps coming back and quickly put back his phone.

I continued the interview for ten more minutes, but he said nothing substantial. He never told me how he met this man, what other signs pointed to him being the messiah, or why he agreed to give this interview. But I thought I had enough for an article. 

When I got up to leave, he stopped me. He handed me a blue palm-shaped amulet, depicting an open hand, an eye in its palm. 

“I have a gift for you,” he said. “For coming all this way. Do you recognize it.”

“Is it the Hand of Fatima?” I asked. 

“It is a *hamsa*. It will protect you against evil.”

I thanked him, put it in the pocket of my jeans, and headed out.

&#x200B;

Outside, I saw a woman walking on the sidewalk, pushing three babies in a stroller. She glanced at me and hurried over.

“I know who you are,” she said, spitting on my face. “You sent my husband to prison. And now you are harassing the *rebbe*.” 

Before I could respond, she walked back to the stroller. So much good the *hamsa* did. 

Once safely back in my car, I googled the state park. As I suspected, there were several caves there. Still had an hour or so of daylight left. Enough to find the con artist who claimed to the Messiah. 

&#x200B;

I arrived at the park when the sun was setting. Consulting a large park map, I located the trail that led to a set of caves less than a quarter of a mile away. There were more distant caves, but I doubted that the elderly rabbi could have hiked that far. 

Outside the caves, I saw a man who looked like a literal caveman. He was dressed in animal furs, with long black hair and a beard thicker than Rabbi Povarsky’s. 

“I knew you would be coming,” he said in a raspy voice. 

“Did Rabbi Povarsky tell you?” I asked, wondering if the rabbi discovered I’d accessed his phone. 

“No. But please, come into my cave.”

I followed the man into the cave, which was empty, the only light coming from the setting sun. I wondered how Povarsky could have been fooled by this crazy man. Yes, the rabbi was senile, but he seemed to have retained some of his senses. 

“I’ve heard you claim the Messiah.” I said, once we were deep into the cave. “Is that true?”

“It is true that I claim to be him, but I am not him, for he has not come, and will not come.”

“So you’ve been fooling Rabbi Povarsky?” I wasn’t expecting him to admit that right off the bat. 

“I have, it was not hard to do so. For his mind is gone.”

“What is your goal in fooling him, is it money? Power?”

“It is power. For most of his followers refuse to believe that his once-great mind is gone” 

“Let’s back up a bit. How about we start with your name, your background, and how you came to meet Rabbi Povarsky.”

“I am older than the world itself, I was there when God marked the earth’s dimensions, when he laid its foundation, when he divided the light from the darkness, in which I dwell. I have been called many names: Beelzebub, Apollyon, Mammon, Belial, Ash-Shaytan, Lucifer, Satan.”

“You’re … uh… you’re saying you’re the devil?” 

“I am him indeed.”

“I see,” This story was going to be too crazy for my paper to publish. “Well, thank you for your time, it’s been a very interesting chat. I must get going.” 

He smiled. “Don’t you need to take a picture of me, for your article.” 

“Good point,” I took out a phone and snapped a picture. “Thanks again.”

I began walking out, but he blocked my path. “You must look at the picture. Perhaps it is blurry, and you will need to take a new one.” 

I looked at it and froze. It was not blurry, but the man’s eyes were fire red. Not red eye from a camera, but entirely red, the pupil, iris, and sclera, all red. 

He laughed. “Did you think after telling you all that, I would just let you go, you silly man? I cannot let you live. I can’t let you expose my plan.” He snapped his fingers and blue flames engulfed the cave’s entrance. 

He threw off his furs, snapped his fingers again and became engulfed in flames. He showed no pain, instead, his face was one of ecstasy. Once the flames died out, he shed his skin like a snake, revealing red scales underneath. Two horns sprouted from his head.

“Do you still not believe me?” he said. “Still think I’m just a crazy hobo?”

I backed up, hoping there was an escape route.

“There’s no escape,” he said, seeming to read my mind. “You are going to be a nice, tasty snack for me.” He grinned, revealing row after row of razor-sharp teeth. 

As I continued backing up, he snapped his fingers again. Flames erupted, enclosing the devil and me in a ring of fire, about twenty feet in diameter. 

“You have two choices,” he said, close enough to me that I could smell the sulfur on his breath. “Either I eat you alive, or you burn yourself to death. I’m not sure which one will be more painful.”

I backed up as far as I could, feeling the fire start to singe the back of my neck. The devil laughed, and snapped his fingers. The flames started closing in. Without any other choice, I moved forward, towards the devil. 

“Shall we dance,” he asked, revealing his monstrous maw. 

I kept inching closer, till I was less than a foot from the devil. He reached out as if to grab me, but recoiled as soon as he touched me, yelping in pain. Suddenly, I remembered. I pulled out the *hamsa* and held it out. He backed away from me, the flames dying. He made a dash for the cave entrance, where he sprouted wings and flew into the night air. 

Four days later, I heard that Rabbi Povarsky had died. Whether he was murdered by the devil, or if it was just a coincidence, I do not know. I made the decision not to publish any of the interviews. However, while the devil’s plans may have been thwarted, I know he is not done scheming. He will be back. And I will be on the lookout for him.
