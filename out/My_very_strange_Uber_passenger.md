I've been driving with Uber in Arizona for about two years. I've had lots of weird passengers, but the one I picked up last Thursday was by far the strangest.   
I pulled up to the gas station. Outside was a young man, about twenty, staring up at the sun. He had long greasy black hair, and, even though it was over a hundred degrees outside, he was wearing a black sweatshirt and black pants. I hoped that he was not my passenger, but he began making his way slowly to my car.  
“Are you Michael?” I asked him, but he did not respond. He just opened the back door and sat down.  
“Is your name Michael?” I asked again.  
“Yeah…I’m…Michael,” he said, talking slowly. He was definitely high on something. I should have canceled the trip, but I desperately needed the money.  
The destination popped up. It was about 40 miles away, in the middle of the desert. I zoomed in on my map, trying to see what was there. It looked like there was nothing but sand.  
“Where are you headed?” I asked him.  
“To...the…desert.”  
“Are you sure you put in the right location?”  
He nodded and closed his eyes. I’ve had lots of strange passengers, but this just seemed off. I wondered if I were going to get robbed out in the desert, but that seemed unlikely. I started driving.  
About ten miles outside of town, I turned onto a narrow gravel road, barely wide enough for two cars to pass. According to the GPS, I was supposed to follow this road for twenty miles.  
I didn’t see another car the entire way. Or pass any sign of civilization. Nothing but cactuses on the side of the road. *What was this road even for? Did it lead to some old mine?*  
After twenty miles, I turned off onto an even narrower dirt road. It was in awful condition, and even though I only had to go two miles on it, it took nearly half an hour. Finally, we arrived outside a ramshackle wooden building, about the size of a small barn. There were no other cars by it.  
I turned to Michael, who was sleeping in the back seat. He hadn’t said a word the entire trip. “We’re here.” *Wherever here was.*  
He did not stir.  
I gently nudged his arm. No reaction. I felt his pulse. It was there, but faint. Very faint.  
As I was considering what to do, Michael’s phone rang. I answered it.  
“I see your car,” a raspy voice said. “Take Michael out and bring him into the building.”  
“He’s sick, he needs to get to a hospital.”  
“No, take him into the building. There is a shaft, throw him down it.”  
“What?”  
“Throw him down the shaft. We will take care of him.”  
Panicking and terrified, I got out of the car and yanked Michael out. I then sped away, leaving him lying facedown in the burning sand. When I was about a half mile from the building, I saw three small figures emerge and drag Michael inside.  
That was the last time I ever drove for Uber.
