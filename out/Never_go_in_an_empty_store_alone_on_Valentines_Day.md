Hello everyone who comes across this post! I’m newer to reddit because I remember my friend suggesting to share my experiences here. So today’s the day I guess! However, I am writing this as fast as possible for my own safety, so I apologize for any errors I may make..

My name is Grace, I’m 22 years old, and I own a small business. It’s called GemDust. This online shop sells Random jewelry, fidgets, etc! Valentines day is around the corner and people typically buy these large bags of random things to give to their valentines person.

So yesterday, (Feb 12th) I got a large valentines order. It was from someone ordering 3 large random bags, and delivered by the morning of Valentines Day. I go to my work office which is literally just the apartment room bought across from mine. I go in my office and start preparing to make this large order, which typically I have a bunch of random toys and little stuffed animals and beads hanging around. Since it’s Valentines theme, I put red and pink colored items in the bags. Including heart confetti and things to make the gift really sparkle. 

I finished some orders that I had gotten previously at around 8PM. I had a few orders to do but I figured I would do these tomorrow. I get into something comfortable after I eat dinner, and start to doze off about an hour or so later. 

At around 12PM I hear a knock at my door. I wake up at the sudden noise, and I cautiously walk towards the front door. The peephole is covered so I slowly open the door. No one is there, but there’s a white envelope with a heart on it. I think to myself, there’s no way I had a secret admirer? I couldn’t tell who it was from, or who it was for, because there was no name on the front. I shut my door and proceed to the living room and sit down on my sofa. I open the letter, it writes:

*Can’t wait to see you soon my dear.*

*Love, your secret admirer* ♡

This had to be some joke by my friends or something. This is like some classic horror type stuff you’d see in those movies. But that’s not reality. I decide to burn the card in my fireplace, not thinking anything of it, and going back to sleep.

By the next morning, (Today) I had finished all my other orders and was able to successfully finish sending them out, but I realized I ran out of confetti and things to tie up the last bag. Of course the last bag was for the person that ordered the three large bags. I needed to go to the craft store to buy more, and I had to be fast because I had to send out these three bags by 6PM or else it would arrive really late tomorrow, possibly not even getting to the person who ordered it. Hobby lobby is around the corner of my neighborhood, so I decide to go there for my craft supplies. I get ready to go out, grabbing my keys and everything, when I notice another heart envelope taped to my door. The note read,

*See you soon~ xoxo*

I look both ways of my apartment hallway, not seeing anyone. I proceed to walk out of my building and head to my car quickly. Who is sending these letters?? Why me??

I start to drive to Hobby Lobby, literally speeding. “No way am I gonna get cursed by this unknown being.” I laughed to myself. I shortly arrived at Hobby Lobby and got out of my car. I looked around and realized, no one was even there. I walked up to the store, the lights were on, and I could see someone at the cashier desk. I proceeded to walk inside.

“Welcome to Hobby Lobby!” The tallish man said smiling. I simply just smiled back. I proceeded trying to find the isle to find confetti supplies, which was near the back of this large store. I go to the isle, and find different types of material I can use for valentines confetti. As I’m looking I can hear slow but loud footsteps in the isle near me. It sounded like they were coming closer. It could just’ve been someone looking for craft things as well, but it was really starting to send chills down my spine. The most bone-chilling part was that the footsteps didn’t even sound like a humans footsteps, they sounded watery, like a reptilian or something similar was walking. Certainly that doesn’t happen though, right? 

I stop moving completely while my thoughts and heart are racing. Then all of a sudden I’m frozen in fear. The tallish man I had seen before at the cash register had very large eyes, black ink like substances dripping down from his skull, and he was just staring directly into my eyes about 10 feet away from me. I make eye contact with him for a while, because I was scared that if I even looked away for a second, that would be my death. 

“Hello, dear.” He says in a very deep voice. 

I got goosebumps from even hearing his voice. This experience was too much, and I couldn’t even seem to form a word. I try to think of a plan to get away from him. I decide that I’ll try to keep eye contact with him, but exit the isle, and run to somewhere safe. So I did. I slowly backed up keeping eye contact with him. He wasn’t moving an inch, keeping that slenderman like pose just staring at me with those horrifyingly red eyes. I exit the isle completely and start sprinting as fast as I could. I ran into the family bathroom, locking myself in there, and hiding in a corner of the bathroom, where I am now as I write to you guys. I’ve been in here for about like.. an hour maybe? It’s 5PM as I’m finishing up this post..

I destroyed the mirror because I’ve heard of it being a gateway for monsters, which has to be some type of joke, but I’m NOT taking any chances. I also used a random metal thing I had in my crossbody bag to hold the door closed more. No one has tried entering the bathroom, but I’m not going out for nobody. I’m unsure what to do next, I’m clearly in danger even if I make it out alive. I’ve called the police line, the one that just sends them to your location, and none of my family members are really close, but I still told them what happened anyways, and my location. I’m unsure where to go from here, but I will hopefully make this out alive somehow. Will update soon maybe?
