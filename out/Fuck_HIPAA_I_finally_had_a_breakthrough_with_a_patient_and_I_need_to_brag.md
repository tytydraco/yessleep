In March 1995, an urban legend began to circulate in Bakersfield, California concerning an immensely violent videogame called “BABYGIRL.”

According to the remor, the player character is a young mother named Sandy. The game begins with a scene depicting Sandy and her daughter, Annemarie, playing Super Mario Brothers on an SNES console. In Annemarie wins a level. Sandy praises her, saying, “Good job, babygirl!”

At that moment, a group of men breaks into the apartment to attack Sandy. They knock her out. The screen fades to black.

Shortly after, a new scene fades in.

Sandy and a hysterically crying Annemarie are in a car with the men. It is nighttime; the sky is dark, with a grinning moon shining through the car window.

A mission menu pops up in the bottom of the screen, providing multiple choices to propel the game forward by prompting the player to convince the men to let Sandy and Annemarie go.

No matter what option the player selects, the mission fails.

Following the mission failure, the car slows to a halt. The men force Sandy and Annemarie out of the car, and proceed to torture Sandy while forcing Annemarie to watch. Annemarie cries throughout while Sandy attempts to comfort her, repeating phrases such as:

“It’s okay, babygirl.”

“They’re just chickens, babygirl.”

“Be brave, babygirl.”

“It’ll be over soon, babygirl.”

“Be strong, babygirl.”

Although choices and option menus appear onscreen over the course of the assault, none change the outcome. 

Once Sandy is incapacitated, the men kill Annemarie, dismember her, and bury her in a shallow pit while Sandy is forced to watched. Throughout the sequence, the game presents the player with several actions for Sandy to take in order to attempt escape.

All choices result in failure.

After burying Annemarie, the men bundle the broken, helpless Sandy into the car.

The screen fades to “GAME OVER.”

No matter how many times the player plays, no matter what options or combinations of choices they make, the result is always the same. The game is unwinnable.

While generally dismissed as an urban legend, the Kern County Sheriff’s Office believed in the possibility of such a game existing, operating on the theory that the game was an inside joke created by someone involved in the unsolved murder that had occurred in November 1994. The names of the victims matched those the characters, and the sequence of events shown in the game matched elements of the case.

Incredibly for a department with such a notoriously checkered history, the department pursued every lead and eventually managed to track down and obtain a copy. 

One detective played the game for several weeks straight in an attempt to search for clues, eventually discovering that credits roll after the GAME OVER scene. Each credited roll – producer, artist, designer, and so on – is the same name: BABYGIRL.

After the credits comes a cut scene of the location where the killers left Annemarie’s remains. The cut scene plays out as follows:

Onscreen, dirt begins to shift and swirl. A pixelated head that is visibly decayed appears. The head is crying. A caption appears:

BABYGIRL NEEDS YOUR HELP. WILL YOU HELP HER? 

X  YES

O  NO

If the player selects YES, the decaying head smiles. Small fireworks erupt around her head. A moment later, the head vanishes. The screen goes dark, displaying a message:

LOOK BEHIND YOU

When the player turns around, the physical revenant of Annemarie appears. It is almost incomprehensibly ghastly.

Understandably, the detective who initially made the discovery resigned from his position, eventually ending up in psychiatric inpatient care. 

The copy of the game remained in department custody until an AHH agent infiltrated the department and took possession of the cartridge. 

Agency personnel played the game under strict observation. When the end scene played, the player selected “NO.”

The screen went dark and displayed the following message: CLOSE YOUR EYES.

As instructed, the agent obeyed. 

The revenant was observed on camera to “materialize” out of the shadows. The revenant’s appearance startled and severely disturbed the observing personnel. Before any action could be taken, the revenant killed the player.

What followed was one of the worst incidents in Agency history. In the end, the revenant was eventually contained at great cost to the AHH.

This entity is not destructible, but she is containable— unless and until someone plays the “BABYGIRL” game.

This has caused significant difficulty over the past thirty years. To date, the Agency has managed to locate and take into possession seventeen copies of “BABYGIRL.” However, there are clearly additional copies circulating given that BABYGIRL periodically vanishes from her cell.

So far, only two copies have been located without incident. The others were only located after the revenant “ported out” following a player summoning her through the game’s “YES” and “NO” buttons.

If a player agrees to help the revenant, the revenant essentially drives them insane – either via haunting and tormenting them (which is what happened to the detective) or by compelling them to retrace the events of her murder and attempt to track down her mother’s whereabouts.

Interestingly, the revenant’s ultimate goal is not retribution against the criminals, but locating her mother’s missing body. 

This appears to be an impossible task, because no one has succeeded. 

When the player invariably fails to find the mother’s burial site in real life, the revenant lures the player to the lake where she herself was murdered and proceeds to kill them. She utilizes the same pattern and manner in which she was brutalized, then scatters the pieces alongside her own before fading away, at which time she reappears in her cell at AHH-NASCU.

The revenant is not happy that she constantly “respawns” in her cell. There have been even ethical objections raised against the fact that the Agency forces her to return to custody. 

However, it is obvious that the AHH has no choice but to contain her. The revenant is dangerous to an objectively ridiculous extent. Further, she appears incapable of controlling her emotions or breaking out of the pattern that was embedded in her at the time of her death. The Agency has no choice but to contain her, and to continue to hunt and destroy extant copies of the game.

Neutralizing the BABYGIRL entity is one of the Agency’s top priorities. Despite acquaintance with all manner of gods and monsters, all personnel at all levels are unusually disturbed by the revenant. Close proximity to her induces fragile mental states and introduces health issues that often become incurable. 

Even worse, she induces these effects in other inmates. This potential for disaster cannot be overstated.

Absent a way to destroy her, our only hope is to neutralize her by locating her mother’s remains. To that end, the Agency has assigned two agents the task of locating the remains of the revenant’s mother.

To date, all efforts have been met with failure.

**Date: 11/20/2024**

My mommy loved videogames. 

Our house was old and it rained inside when it rained outside, and it had a stinky bathroom and roaches under the fridge, but our bedroom was so pretty and it had a big TV and so many games. When Mommy wasn’t working or going to church, that’s what we did. We played video games.

I don’t think Mommy loved going to church, but she went a lot. She always cried. She went up to the altar a lot and sometimes the preacher even, and cried for Jesus to help her. It scared me when she cried. I didn’t like going to church.

But after church, she came home and cooked chicken for dinner, and I liked *that*. Mommy didn’t like chicken. She said chickens were too smart to eat and also too dirty, but she made chicken anyway for me. My mommy’s chicken is my favorite food. I wish I had some of her chicken now. She chopped it into little pieces and fried it in her pan. It smelled so good. I don’t know how to cook chicken, but I know how to eat it. I could show you how to cook it and you could make it for me. I’ll share with you. I promise. It’s so good.

So Mommy would go to church and cry and scare me, but then she would come home and make chicken and smile, and then we would eat and play video games. 

Mommy was good at playing, but I wasn’t. I always made her lose. She pretended I played good and she played bad, but I knew better. The only time we won the games was when she secretly unplugged my controller. I always saw her unplug it, but I pretended not to. She always pretended that I won. We pretended for each other. 

We went to church on the day those guys came.

Before we left church, she cried to the priest. He was very nice. He liked my mommy a lot. I don’t think he liked me, but he liked her so much that he was nice to me. He gave me candy, then told her not to be scared. He said that God was on her side, and the policemen too. Nobody could hurt her. Anybody who said they were going to hurt her was just playing pretend. 

Then we went home, and Mommy cooked chicken with peppers in her pan. I didn’t help her cook because I’m not allowed to touch the pan because it will burn me. I talked instead. I talked about this boy at school named Evan. Evan was a big kid and he was really mean. He always picked on me, and I was so mad about it. She was mad too.

“You’re not even half his size. The only reason he’s picking on you is because he’s a coward.”

“What’s a coward?”

“You know.” She pointed at the pan. “A chicken.”

“But we eat chickens. Chickens taste good.”

“People-chickens aren’t for eating, and they’re not tasty,” she said. “People chickens are…like scaredy-cats, only jerks. People who are too scared to fight anyone who isn’t a lot smaller than them. Who are scared of things that shouldn’t scare them.”

I wondered if I was a coward because. That’s because I was scared of the roaches under the fridge, and they were a lot smaller than me.

“They’re not worth your time, babygirl. Don’t worry about that boy. But if he messes with you again, you have my permission to punch his lights out.”

I still didn’t understand about people-chickens. People are people. Chickens are chickens. But it was funny to pretend about Evan being a chicken. A big stinky chicken with a wattle. He’d look so funny. He wouldn’t be able to push me, either, because chickens have no arms. 

After that, we ate the chicken for our dinner from the pan with the peppers. Then we played video games. Mommy was so happy. She was always happy when we played video games. I loved playing video games with her. She always let me win.

We were having so much fun.

But then those guys came.

They banged on the door and really scared me. They scared my mommy too. She told me to hide, but then the door broke and those guys came inside.

They made us leave the house. I asked them to let me and Mommy go, but they laughed and said no. Then they made me get in their car. The car was stinky like puke and skunks. It had a rip in the seat right by me. I saw foam inside, and a roach. I hate roaches. They’re gross. They live under my fridge and I hate them.

Mommy talked to those guys for the whole ride. She kept saying I was so little, just a baby, just a little babygirl. And then she was saying scary stuff like they could take her but they had to let me out of the car. They had to let me out because I was just a baby. But I’m not a baby. I was scared of the road. I didn’t want them to make me get out of the car by myself. I don’t know the way home.

The moon was scary, almost as scary as when Mommy kept telling those guys to make me get of the car and leave me in the road. I saw the moon shining through the window. It was looking at me. I didn’t know the moon could look. I don’t want it looking.

Mommy still kept telling them to let me out of the car and that made me cry harder. When I cried, the moon smiled.

One of those guys told Mommy to shut up or they would throw me out of the car while it was moving. That was so scary. I scraped my knee once and it hurt. If those guys threw me out of the car I would get scraped all over and it would hurt so bad. And I’d still be alone on the road and lost because I don’t know my way home.

I thought Mommy was mad at me. I thought that’s why she wanted me to get out of the car and walk home by myself. I was scared I was in trouble for crying so much. 

I was glad when the car stopped. Even if they made me get out of the car and walk home, Mommy would come too. Together. That’s what Mommy always said. You and me, babygirl, together forever.

They made me and Mommy get out of the car. I hugged her, but those guys made me let go. They hit me really hard until I let go. 

Mommy was screaming and calling them names and bad words. I don’t really remember those words. I don’t remember bad words because I don’t say them. I don’t remember things I don’t say. I only say what I learn so I remember, like Mrs. Knutsen says. That’s my teacher.

The only word Mommy called them that wasn’t bad was cowards. She kept saying they were cowards. That’s why I remember, because cowards isn’t a bad word. Cowards just means chickens.

But even though cowards isn’t a bad word, those guys acted like it was a bad word. They got really mad and started hitting my mommy. It made me scared. It made me cry. It made me a coward.

I thought Mommy would be mad at me because they were hitting her instead of me. But she wasn’t mad. She didn’t call me bad words and she didn’t call me a coward. She just said “Don’t cry, babygirl. It’s okay, babygirl. It’ll be over soon, babygirl. Don’t be scared, babygirl. They’re just chickens, babygirl, don’t be scared of chickens. Be strong, babygirl. Be brave, babygirl.”

I tried to be strong and brave, but I was too scared and I cried.

Those guys hit her more. They hit her so much. Her face had blood and her eyes were really big and purple. They looked popped out even though they were closed. She didn’t even look like my mommy anymore. Looking at her scared me. I wasn’t even sure it was her. But then she whispered, “I love you, babygirl.” And she sounded like my mommy. That’s how I knew it was her, even though she looked so scary.

Then those guys put her back in the car. I tried to get in too because I didn’t want them to forget me. I didn’t want to be left outside in the dark. I don’t know my way home.

Those guys laughed at me when I tried to sit in the var by my mommy. They made me get out. I cried. My mommy cried too. She tried to get up but she couldn’t. They hit her too much. That’s why she couldn’t get up anymore.

Then those guys showed me their gun and I got killed. There was a bullet, and it burned really bad and I fell down. I couldn’t get up either, just like my mommy. We couldn’t get up together.

Those guys turned me into pieces after I couldn’t get up. Pieces like a chicken, only I don’t have wings. I have arms because I’m not really a chicken.

After they turned me into pieces, they drove away with my mommy and left me in the dark. They didn’t come back even though I don’t know my way home. I couldn’t get up. I was so scared. I was alone and I couldn’t get up, and my mommy was gone with those guys. We weren’t together because those guys left me and took her in their car. I wish they let me in the car so Mommy and I could be together forever. But instead she was far away in the car with those guys and I was chopped up in pieces like a chicken in the park far away. 

I waited for my mommy to come back and help me get up, or even for those guys to come back. But they forgot me, and so did my mommy. 

I thought about Mommy a lot. I pretended she didn’t forget me. I pretended she was there and that we were eating chicken, the chicken she cooked in her pan with the peppers. I pretended we were playing video games. I pretended she didn’t have to let me win. I pretended I was so good at playing video games and I pretended we both won every game. 

I pretended for a long time, so long I think I missed Christmas and even my birthday. That was okay because pretending was better than being alone in pieces in the park.

But then I got tired of pretending.

I got up. All by myself, I got up. I left my pieces in the ground because they were scary. I didn’t want to take them with me.

I took a step. Just one step, and then I wasn’t even in the park anymore.

I was inside a living room.

It wasn’t my living room, but my mommy’s games were there. All the games we played together, plus the grown up games I wasn’t supposed to play. I even saw a new game called BABYGIRL. That’s what she always called me. Babygirl. I thought maybe Mommy made a game just for me, and that’s why she forgot to come back and get me. Because she was too busy making my game and moving out of our old house with the stinky bathroom and into this new house.

Since her games were there, I thought she was there too. So I looked for her, only I didn’t find her. Not in the living room, or the bathroom, or the kitchen. I didn’t even see her in the bedroom. She wasn’t anywhere. So I thought she was at work or at church or maybe at the store to buy chicken and peppers for dinner.

I sat down to wait. I sat down and looked at her games and waited for her to come home.

But she didn’t come home.  Those guys came home. The ones who put her in the car and turned me into pieces like a chicken.

*Those* guys.

I was so scared, but I was even more mad. Those guys drove my mommy away and left me and made her her forget about me, and then they stole her games! They stole all my mommy’s video games!

That made me so mad I forgot to be scared. That made me so mad that I yelled at them.

I thought they would laugh at me for yelling, or maybe get mad and hit me again. But I didn’t care because I was just so mad! 

I was so mad it scared them. I scared them so much. It was so funny. They screamed when I yelled at them. They tried to run away, but I didn’t let them go. One of those guys even peed his pants! It was funny. They kept crying and they kept asking me to let them go. 

But that made me really mad again. It was so not fair. When I asked them to let me and my mommy go, they told me no. When I tried to get in the car so I could be together with my mommy, they laughed and turned me into pieces just like a chicken.

But I’m not a chicken.

I’m not a coward.

But those guys were being cowards. They cried and screamed and they peed their pants and they tried to run away from me. Me! Just a little kid, just a little babygirl not even half their size.

Those guys were scared anyway. That means they’re cowards.

And that means they’re chickens.

I don’t know how to cook chickens.

But I know how to eat them. 

They didn’t taste good, I guess because Mommy didn’t cook them. But I can show you how to cook chicken like Mommy did. It probably won’t taste as good as hers, just so you know. 

But if you cook for me, I’ll pretend for you.

\* \* \*

Full disclosure: If you haven’t read the other patient files, this next part won’t make sense so skip.

What you just finished reading was a transcript of the first and only conversation Babygirl has had with anyone in the Pantheon.

Administration calls it a breakthrough. They’re excited. Probably way too excited because they’re already floating the idea of reclassifying her following the conclusion of her treatment plan — the very same treatment plan they want me to design and implement. 

They’re so impressed with me that they struck my past fuck-up from my record *and* gave me a reward. 

Unfortunately, the reward was nothing but a “special meal” with other T-Class agents who have distinguished themselves in the past month.

That was bad.

The meal was — I shit you not — Kentucky Fried Chicken, which was worse. 

Worse even than that, it turns out that the only other T-Class agent who distinguished himself this month was—

“So we get to have our talk together after all.”

The speaker was a jumpsuited monster of a man with perfectly groomed hair and one of the strangest faces I’ve ever seen, brutish yet doll-like, and impossible to judge in terms of age.

Worse than all the rest was the explosion of gut-wrenching, primal terror that exploded in my chest at the sight of him. It felt like being trapped in a tiny room with a rabid mandrill. My lizard brain was screaming that death was here.

“I like this kind of talking better.” His voice was deep and rough yet terribly smooth, every bit as contradictory as his doll-brute face. And while the words themselves were innocuous, nothing else about him was. Not his body language, not his tone, not the leering smile, not even the exaggerated way he picked apart his chicken.

And all at once, I was mad. Really, really, *really* mad.

I’m no stranger to sexual harassment. I’m even less a stranger to shitty assholes who flex their nuts for the sole purpose of watching people recoil at the sight of their ball skin. 

And I just wasn’t willing to put up with it. Especially not here, where I already had to put up with so much.

So I rearranged my face into an ice queen mask and slammed myself into the chair across from him. “Do I have you to thank for the menu?”

“Never. I thought it was you.” He tore a chicken breast apart and tossed half at me. It skidded across the table, leaving a ribbon of grease in its wake. 

Without allowing myself to think, I picked it up and took the biggest bite I could manage. 

He gave me a smile, that awful jackal grin that turned my insides to slurry. “I’d written you off after our last meeting, but maybe I was wrong. Maybe you’re man enough to be my girl after all.”

“That is one hell of a pickup line, and not in the way you want.”

“It has never worked. But then I’ve only tried it the once.” He bit into another piece of chicken, watching me as he chewed. His eyes were too bright yet weirdly opaque. Like eyes on a trail cam. “I don’t actually want to talk to you.”

“Same.”

“I hate the way you smell.”

“What do I smell like?”

“Expensive chocolate and cheap lipstick.”

For reasons I won’t get into right now, he was dead right and despite myself, I was mightily impressed. “You have a spectacular nose, I’ll give you that.”

“I do.” He kept watching me, eyes still shining. I thought again of trail cams. Of mountain lions and wolves slinking through the underbrush. 

Fear crept up again, punching holes through the anger I wore as armor.

“My name is Christophe,” he said.

“I know.”

“You were so scared when we met I did not think you would remember.”

“To the contrary, it is not something I will ever forget.”

Then, following an instinct I never understand but always trust, I picked up a cookie and tossed it to him. He picked it up and even though he didn’t smile, I knew it was the best thing I could have done.

“This is not a good place,” he told me. “But you can make it good for you if you do not fight them.”

“Don’t worry. I’m definitely not a fighter.”

“That is the first lie you’ve told me. I hope it is the last.” Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a pair of pliers.

Once again, my insides turned to ice water.

He noticed, then shook his head. “Not for you. For me.”

“Why…?”

“Because wolves with teeth do not go to heaven.”

Before I could say a word, because I could react, before I could even think, he put the pliers in his mouth and wrenched out a canine.

I wanted to scream, but couldn’t.

I wanted to run, but didn't dare.

I did not want to sit there, ice queen mask fixed in place, as he pulled out his teeth one by one, swallowing mouthfuls of blood as he arranged his teeth in need rows of seven, but I did it anyway. 

After he pulled his last tooth — breaking and splintering it along the way — I asked, gently but as firmly as I have ever asked anything, “Christophe, why did you do that?”

“So that when we are forced to speak again,” he said thickly, apparently heedless of the blood pouring down his chin, "you will remember that the big bad wolf hates his teeth. Even though they grow back, even though they always grow back, I *hate* them.”

He swept his bloodstained teeth into his hands and knelt by my side. I fought the urge to bolt. He was so huge that we were at eye level even though he was kneeling. His eyes shone, flat and bright and wrong.  He dropped his teeth into my lap without a word, without changing his expression, without even blinking. 

Then he left.

I haven’t seen him since.

But I’m going to be seeing him again really soon.

I received my interview schedule today, and Christophe and I are talking this Sunday. It was supposed to be today, but now we have to wait for his teeth to grow back. 

If someone had told me two days ago that there’d be a confrontation I dreaded even more than the Harlequin, I probably would have laughed. When I really think about it, I still kind of want to laugh.

But then I think of Christophe's eyes, flat and shining in that terrible face. I think of his teeth dropping into my lap.

And the last thing I want to do is laugh.

I still have his teeth. Not because I want them, but because I clearly need the reminder to not try to pull a power play on crazy...

And because he hates them.

Anything you hate becomes a weapon someone can use against you. I don’t know why Christophe hates his teeth. I don’t even know if that why will make a good weapon.

But at this point I’ll take what I can get.
