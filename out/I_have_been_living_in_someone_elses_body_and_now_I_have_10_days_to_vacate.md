I was born July 30, 2003 at 2:23 AM. I weighed 8 pounds and 11 ounces as soon as my mother seen my face she knew that she had a bright beautiful baby boy.


As my father cut my umbilical cord and handed me to the doctor for initial tests like bloodwork and such fourth the doctor turned to my mother and said your baby boy is very healthy. The tests came back. And there is no problems.


The doctor walked me over to my mother and handed me to her. She wrapped me up in her arms and snuggled me and also rubbed the back of my head


The doctor turned to my father and said, can I talk to you in the hallway for a second my father reluctantly said yes once they reached the hallway, the doctor said 


Tim, there is something odd about your child. All the initial medical tests came back a OK but when I looked into the child’s eyes it seemed void of life, any life to be exact


My father got red in the face and said what exactly are you trying to say? That my son is sick is he going to die? The doctor said with a calm tone


No, your son is not going to die and he is definitely not sick, but there’s definitely something up with that boy I just can’t quite put my finger on it 


Then, what should we do doctor? I think you should just watch him intensively don’t leave him alone and bring him in for regular check ups. Constantly.


To make sure his health is still going well. OK and then what? Do I just stand here and look at my wife holding my beautiful baby boy? While , she has no idea. What you just said?


Seriously man what am I supposed to do? Sir I honestly think you should keep it from her as long as you can to not freak her out women’s hormones go crazy after they give birth. 


And a few months afterwards just watch your child and make sure he’s healthy that’s all I’m asking you. OK thank you doctor. I’m going to go back in to see my baby boy.


What did the doctor ask you honey? Oh nothing Catherine he was just giving me his personal business card so he can do the baby’s check ups from now on


The doctor said he felt a personal connection with our baby boy. After all he said that was the first baby born in this hospital. It is partially new anyways.


Catherine. What do you think we should name our baby boy? Um, let me think Tim… Josiah we should name him, Josiah oh Catherine I think that’s a beautiful name 


Let’s head home and get baby boy Josiah acquainted with his new home 

(20 YEARS LATER)

Josiah take the trash out. It’s been sitting there all day. My mom yelled out to me as I was sitting on the couch watching television I got up reluctantly and headed to the kitchen. I grabbed the trash bag, tied it up and walked out the back door.


I threw the trash bag to the curb and walked back through the back door in the kitchen, and then into the living room. My mother was in the kitchen, cooking dinner.


Mom, what are you cooking tonight? Oh Josiah you always ask that. We always have tacos on Tuesdays. I know mom I was just curious anyways, I’m going to go finish my show.


As soon as I sat on the couch to unpause my TV on Hulu to continue my anime binge watch my phone rang on the end table. I picked it up and said


Hello, who is this? the voice on the other end of the phone was raspy and dark. I couldn’t tell if it was male or female the person said that’s not the question we are asking now is it?


The real question is who are you really think about that hard you are you really are you the person you actually think you are or are you someone else entirely?


I spat back who the hell are you weirdo and why are you calling at this time of night anyways and what do you mean? Am I the person I actually think I am that makes absolutely no sense.


Oh, does it haven’t you been having weird vivid dreams of another life do you have memories false memories to be exact that you don’t know exactly where they came from?


Yes, I do you are creeping me out even more. How do you even know that oh I know a lot trust me I’ve seen things also things you won’t believe.


You have 10 days to vacate, or your life will expire. What do you mea.. before I can even finish my sentence, the person hung up on the other side of the phone


I felt belittled and confused, but also curious at the same time what did that person mean that I had 10 days to vacate or my life will expire? Also, how did that person know


That I have been having weird, vivid dreams and false memories of a past life that I know doesn’t exist. Before I can finish that thought my mother yelled out to me dinner time Josiah!


 ( DAY 1… 9 DAYS LEFT)


I woke up like any other morning with my phone alarm blaring in my right ear because I sleep on my side as I turned over to grab my phone I seen a strange mark on my arm


The best way I can describe it is a bold circle with the number ten in it with a line crossing out the ten and a bunch of sideways lines, filling the rest of the circle, except for the zero of the 10 there was a sad face there


The first thought that popped in my head when I seen that tattoo was what the fuck is this? I don’t have any tattoos and I was never planning on getting any. I don’t have many friends.


And I don’t go to parties maybe it’s the morning grogginess anyways, I have to head to work. It should be gone by the time I drink my coffee and clock in.


Hey Josiah, how are you doing this morning? Oh I’m doing good Ronald how are you doing this morning? I’m doing fine as well. Thank you for asking.


Anyways, Ronald, what machine do they have me on this morning let me check the papers one second Josiah it seems they have you on melt deck this morning head on over to plant 2B


For further instructions. As I was walking over to plant 2B I got super dizzy and seen a figure lurking 15 feet in front of me at first I didn’t notice it and then I seen it fully


It had a cloak on a dark black colored midnight cloak. Its body had no skin. It was only bones, but the bones were dark red and covered in decaying holes with green splotches of acid dripping out of them


The figure moved its cloak up and pointed to in a gesture, as if it was tapping on something I squinted and it looked as if it was tapping on a wrist watch
