I teach in an art school—well, more like a mentorship program held in a medium-sized building. My eldest son is as obsessed with drawing as I once was. He fixates on realism, always trying to make every detail perfect. But sometimes, realism isn’t just difficult—it’s unnatural.

That afternoon, I came home drained. My patience was gone after a long day dealing with entitled students. As I stepped through the door, my son jumped out from the hallway.

	“Hey! I made you a Father’s Day drawing!”



The enthusiasm in his voice didn’t match the chill that ran through me.

	“Thanks…” I managed to say, still on edge.



The drawing showed us eating spaghetti at the dinner table. Across the top, written in red: “HAPPY FATHER’S DAY.” But something was off. One detail gnawed at me—my younger son wasn’t in the picture. Not just forgotten. Absent.

What disturbed me more was the red paint. It wasn’t paint. At least, it didn’t feel like it. It looked thick, dark, and all too real. Still, I said nothing. Maybe he used some expensive boutique paint, I told myself. Maybe.

But the house was quiet. Not normal quiet. The kind of quiet that feels wrong.

	“Where’s your little brother?” I asked.



My son shifted his eyes away.

	“He said he was going to the basketball court.”



I called his phone. No answer. Just a long, dead silence before it rang out as a missed call.

Hours passed. I filed a missing person report. Hired a private detective—one with a reputation, and a price tag to match. Nothing. My son had vanished without a trace. Just… gone.

I lost sleep. Lost weight. Lost something I couldn’t name. I started therapy, because if I didn’t, I was going to lose myself too.

A year later, I came home late from work. My son greeted me at the door again, holding something behind his back.

	“Hey Dad. I made you something.”



No mention of Father’s Day this time. Just a drawing. Us skydiving together. The red lettering at the top read:
“You’re the best dad I’ve ever had.”

The red this time was different—faded, low-quality, almost like marker ink. The drawing didn’t sit right with me. But I forced a smile.

	“Thanks. Want some caramel cookies?”



He nodded.

After the snack, I got up to take out the trash.

	“Wait—how about I do it?” he asked quickly.



There was a flicker of panic in his eyes. I waved him off.

	“No. I’ve got it.”



I walked out with the bag and headed for the old shed where I stored the garbage. As I neared it, something hit me. A stench. Rotten. Heavy. It wasn’t just garbage.

	“Damn pests,” I muttered.



Still, something about the smell forced me to check. Behind some loose wooden boards, I noticed something hidden. I grabbed a screwdriver and pried them open.

Behind them…
Was my younger son.
Or what was left of him.

His body, dried and lifeless, lay curled in on itself. A stab wound split his chest. Blood had long since dried into the fabric of his shirt.

I collapsed. Not in grief. In dread.

Because suddenly, I remembered the first painting.
The one with the too real red.
