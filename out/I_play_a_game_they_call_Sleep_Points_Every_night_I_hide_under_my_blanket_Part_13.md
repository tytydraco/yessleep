I started to see my inability to sleep as a good thing.  After all, if 45 minutes of sleep didn’t count, why not make myself even more tired by not even giving myself that?  If I could stay up until I had to get out of bad, that would probably make it all the more easy to go to sleep the next night.  Though it wasn’t as though I had any real choice in the matter.  The activation fluid, now fucking up my brain in ways that I could never even hope to understand, was calling the shots for me.  But nevertheless, I was still able to think sort of optimistically about my lack of sleep for a short while there.  Why relieve my need to sleep with an amount that isn’t even gonna help me?

But then I started thinking about how bad of a sign it was if I couldn’t get 45 or even 30 minutes of sleep.  If I couldn’t even manage that, how the hell was I gonna string together 90 minutes of continuous sleep?   Anastasia was right.  While sleeping for 90 minutes straight at some point throughout a 72-hour stretch of time sounded laughably easy, 90 minutes of sleep all at once was quickly showing itself to be quite a challenge now that Stage Two had started.

I knew I shouldn’t have been surprised by how difficult it was to sleep.  After all, it wasn’t as if Anastasia hadn’t warned me.  But I was just so used to the idea that if I just held still in bed for long enough, even if it took hours, sleep would have to come eventually.  Or at least, it would if I had gotten up at a reasonable hour that morning.  And I had.  I was up bright and early at 6 o'clock sharp, the morning before.  

Sure, there had been nights before where I had spent the whole night trying to sleep and couldn’t.  But that was only ever during summer break when I would wake up obscenely late in the afternoon at like 4 or 5 PM.  Never had I ever woken up at 6 AM and still found myself completely unable to go to sleep, no matter how long I laid in bed.  This just wasn’t how it was supposed to work.  I knew this was how Sleep Points worked.  At least at a conscious level.  But I had never experienced anything like it before, so it still felt all wrong, even if I knew I didn’t really have any right to feel surprised.

Well, maybe I shouldn’t be so quick to say never.  On Tuesday the 12th, my second night of Sleep Points, the same thing had happened.  I had spend the whole night awake and trying to sleep, even though I had gotten up at 6:30.  But even then, that was only because I had the living shit scared outta me as a result of finding out that The Sandman was real, and not just some sleep paralysis demon.  And, as scary as The Sandman’s voice was, as scary as it was that he had, for the first time ever, said something, it just didn’t have the same effect.  This time, though, I hadn’t been kept up by fear.  I had instead been kept up by something that I couldn’t entirely understand and that I couldn’t do anything about:  The Activation Fluid.  

By the time 6:30 rolled around, I hadn’t slept at all.  I had hoped that it wouldn’t be too obvious to my parents how I hadn’t gotten even a moment of sleep.  God only knows how worried about me they’d be.  And what would my story be?  How would I explain to them why I hadn’t slept at all without bringing up my involvement in Sleep Points?  And they obviously couldn’t know about that.  Maybe I would tell them that I did sleep, and that it was just a rough night.  Although, even then, they’d probably still be asking why, so who knows if it’d even help. 

Thankfully, I must’ve looked just as tired as I normally did when getting up for school, since they didn’t seem especially worried about me.  I ate my breakfast as usual, not really talking, just like I would on any typical morning.  It was almost time to catch the bus when I started to get the feeling as though I was missing something.  As though I was forgetting something really important that I had to take to school with me.  Was it something about my environmental science project?

And then it hit me: Anastasia’s blanket.  I was supposed to give that back to her at sixth period.  Even though the bus was only a minute or two away, I immediately ran upstairs, burst open my bedroom door, and started rummaging like a maniac looking for that damn blanket.  I couldn’t see it at first.  I had to spend somewhere from 30 seconds to a full minute just looking for it. 

“Morgan, the bus is almost here, get downstairs,” my mom shouted from the living room.

“Coming,” I shouted back, just before quickly arriving at where the blanket was, right under a heap of dirty clothes.  I put the blanket straight in my backpack, rushed downstairs, and caught the bus just in the nick of time. 

Usually, this would be the time where I fell asleep on the bus.  Especially if I had had a rough night.  But of course, I still couldn’t.  I tried resting my head against the window for about 5 minutes or so but felt as awake as ever.  It was probably just as well.  If I was to fall asleep then, it would probably spoil my chances of falling asleep the following night.  At school, I was almost worried I would doze off in class, just because of how stupidly tired I felt.  But at the same time, part of me kinda wanted to drift away.  Just to prove to myself that I still could.  But I didn’t.  I couldn’t

Even though I wasn’t dozing off, you wouldn’t have known it by looking at my ability to focus or pay attention, whether we’re talking about in class or anywhere else.   Even if I wasn’t eyes-shut falling asleep, I still found myself daydreaming quite a bit.  Which, as far as school is concerned, is pretty much just as bad.  Sure, it’s a bit more difficult to catch you.  A teacher can’t just look at you and immediately know you’re sleeping.  But they still have to get your attention in the same way they would have to if you had only just woken up.

In 5th period, for example, Mrs. Bagfield had to call my name twice before ultimately having to shout it for me to respond to whatever question she had asked me.  I was way too out of it to remember exactly what the question was or even what answer I gave, but I definitely remember getting laughed at for how stupid it had apparently wound up being. 

As stressed as I was getting over how long it had been since I had last fallen asleep, I just tried to keep reminding myself that I wasn’t in uncharted territory just yet.  I had to remember that I had been through this before back on the night of the 12th.  I wasn’t able to sleep that night either, and I was still fine in the end.  

And even outside of that, there were plenty of times in which I had stayed up the entire night.  Granted, none of those other times, aside from the night of the 12th, were against my will.  All those other nights I had been intentionally keeping myself up on all-night gaming sessions.   All those other nights were by choice.  And if they ever weren’t, it could always pretty easily be chalked up to the fact that I had slept in until practically twilight.  Or at least, the time of day when it would normally be twilight anywhere else in the world.  The Alaskan sun can set at pretty wildly different times throughout the year.  But, getting back on track, whatever the case may have been, going a night without sleep was by no means unprecedented in my life up to that point.

Now, two nights in a row without sleep would be something new.  There had been plenty of times in which I tried to pull it off, but even when I had actively wanted to accomplish it on purpose, I never succeeded.  If I were to go two whole nights in a row without going to sleep, all while fighting for my life to do so, that seemed like it would be the point of no return.  And that scared me half to death.  Because I knew damn well that that might just be what the future had in store.  If it happened for two nights in a row, it felt like it was all but guaranteed to happen for a third.  And if THAT were to happen, I would quite literally be dead meat by the hand of The Sandman.

And then, soon enough, it was 6th period, and I was gonna have to face Anastasia.  Part of me wondered if she would immediately be able to tell, just by looking at me, that I had gotten no sleep on the previous night.  In order to combat this, I took a quick detour into the boys’ room and splashed some water in my face just to give myself a somewhat half-assed appearance of being well-rested and wide awake.  She probably knew that I hadn’t slept.  Just like she seemed to know everything about me, whether I liked it or not.  But I still felt the need to do whatever I could to avoid worrying her.

I made it to the computer room just in time and took my seat next to Anastasia.  But none of my feeble attempts to fake looking awake mattered.  Naturally, right as I sat down, she started grilling me.

“How did you sleep?” She asked.  

“Maybe she isn’t only asking me this because she can tell, just by looking at me, that I hadn’t gotten even a single minute of sleep”, I thought to myself.  After all, she had asked me that same question the day before.  But even still, I couldn’t help but feel as though she probably was.  I didn’t have anywhere near enough faith in my wide-awake disguise to keep it up, so I pretty much caved instantly.  “What do you think?”  I responded.

“Did you get any?” She asked.

“No,” I replied miserably.  I was expecting the response to worry her, but she didn’t look especially phased.  She kinda looked as though she was expecting me to say that.  As though my complete inability to sleep on the first night of Stage Two was perfectly normal and to be expected.  Which, for what it was worth, was somewhat reassuring.

“You know how to help me sleep better?” I asked.

“Empty your mind.  Breathe.  Focus on your breathing.  Maybe put on relaxing music.  Sometimes it works for me,” she responded simply.  “The third quarter moon will be out tonight.” She said, with what looked like a bit of a smile.

“Okay?” I responded a bit confused.

“The moon is waning.” She said, sounding somewhat pleased with that fact.

“And?” I asked, trying to decode whatever this was supposed to mean.

“It gets better,” she responded.  I tried getting more out of her, but she never did explain to me what the hell the moon had to do with anything for all the rest of class.  All I could gather was that somehow, it would get a little better.  Whatever that meant.  Maybe it meant going to sleep would get a it easier or something like that.  I had sure hoped so.  But I couldn’t really tell.

“I have your blanket, by the way,” I told her.  Immediately, she appeared almost overcome with joy.  And this was pretty unusual for her.  Usually, she was pretty hard to read.  It was typically pretty tough to tell exactly how she felt, at least just by looking at her.  But, for right then, it was as obvious as ever that she was VERY happy to be getting her blanket back.

“Thank you!” she said.  “Thank you so much, Morgan!” she repeated.  “I would say that I knew I could count on you, but I thought for sure you would fail me!” she said.  

“Uh… yeah.  Gee thanks,” I said, royally pissed off to find out that she had basically NO faith in me at all.  But then she said something else that made me feel a bit better.

“Clearly, I have misunderestimated you,” she said.

“Uh, actually, it’s ‘underestimated’,” I said, correcting her.

“Oh, oh yes, of course.  What I meant to say was ‘underestimated’, of course,” she said.  “I have lost my typical keen sense of grammar as a consequence of my own lack of sleep,” she explained.  

“Careful, now.  Don’t break your arm patting yourself on the back,” I said, still kinda mad that she managed to turn what was supposed to be a compliment for me into a compliment for herself.

“I say what I do because it is the truth as I see it,” she said simply.  “Perhaps you find me to be somewhat haughty, and perhaps your assessment is correct.  There have been many instances in which I have been forced to confront myself with the fact that that is likely to be true.  The mind’s litany of self-serving biases are quite the complex phenomena to cope with. However, in any case, even if you are correct, a possibility that I will by no means dismiss, is it not preferrable for me to be outwardly arrogant rather than to mask it in feigned humility?  In the former case, I am, if nothing else, not demanding, tacitly or otherwise, undue praise in response to some disingenuous performance of modesty which I do not have,” she finished.

By now, my head was spinning, and I wasn’t following her at all.  Why couldn’t she just talk like a normal person for god’s sake?  “In English, please,” I said back.

“You think that I am prideful, and maybe you are right,” she started.  “I’m sorry.  I would typically apologize in a more formal manner, but I know you don’t want that from me, and I respect that,” she said.  “But you must admit, people who are openly full of themselves are much less unbearable than those who are full of themselves and pretend as though they are not,” she continued.  “To whatever extent you are agitated with me, you should understand that I will not treat you as though your reasons for feeling that way are invalid.  I said that I have a keen sense of grammar because I find that I speak with greater proficiency than the typical person.   On this, I believe you will agree with me.  Perhaps you resent me for my superfluously erudite mode of speech, and for this I will not fault you.  However, you will, nevertheless, agree that it is constructed with more regard for grammar than the manner in which the average fifteen-year-old speaks,” she finished.  

I mean, she was right.  She definitely DID talk with a higher Lexile Score than the average 9th grader.  Hell, higher than the average College Professor, I’d say.  But, in my defense, the reason I was so upset wasn’t THAT she pointed it out.  It was the fact that she said it during one of the rare occasions where she gave me praise instead of giving me crap about something, like she normally does.  Or at least, it was ONE of the reasons why i was so made just then.  The only one I was thinking of at the time, anyway.

“You must understand, Morgan:  I only referenced the quality of my grammar because you criticized it, and it is uncommon for my grammar to require criticism.  Believing that you would find this set of circumstances strange, given that you have full knowledge of how I speak, I wished to abate your impending sense of confusion by contextualizing my mistake,” she explained.

“Bullshit,” I said back.

“I beg your pardon?” she asked.

“You make one grammatical fuck-up, or whatever the hell the word for shit that has to do with grammar is,” I continued.

“That is correct.  The word “grammatical” is a valid word and you have employed it appropriately,” she said.

“Yeah.  Thanks.  So anyway, you screw up your grammar just ONCE, and next thing I know, instead of thanking me, you’re running defense for yourself, taking about your ‘keen sense of grammar’.  Because god forbid little miss perfect Anastasia Bowman make a mistake.  You just couldn’t say anything positive about me without jerking yourself off, while you were at it,” I pressed onward.  “Hell, you couldn’t even gimme credit for giving you back your previous blankie without casually being all like, ‘oh by the way, you’re fucking USELESS’,” I finished.

Anastasia paused for a moment, going completely silent, and gathering her thoughts.  She closed her eyes for a moment, took a deep breath, and responded.  “We shall discuss this no longer.  You have shown me that there is nothing I can say or do to change your outlook,” she said, trying to put the conversation to bed.

“Okay,” I said, raising my voice now.  “I gotcha.  So, you think I’m just SO stubborn,” I started.  “Well y’know, what?  I AM stubborn,” I said, getting more mad by the moment.  “And y’know WHY I’m stubborn?  Because I’m RIGHT,” I said.  “I KNOW that you just can’t handle somebody ELSE correcting YOU.  Lemme guess:  that’s only for YOU to do right?” I said, nearly shouting.  Unfortunately, though, we weren’t in Anastasia’s bedroom in the dead of night, while everyone around us was asleep.  I was raising my voice up at her in full earshot of everyone else in the room.  Next thing I knew, I had caught the attention of Mr. Brigham, who came striding over to break us up.

“Alright, alright, let’s settle down now, Morgan,” Mr. Brigham said.  “Care to explain what’s gotten you so riled up?” he asked.  I took a moment to glance around the room.  Everyone in the library had their eyes glued to me, including kids from other classes who weren’t using the computer section like ours was.  Great.  As if I hadn’t humiliated myself enough for one day.  First, there was Mrs. Bagfield’s class where I gave a ridiculously incoherent answer to whatever her math question was, prompting the whole class to laugh.  Now this.

Then, of course, there was the problem of how the hell I was gonna explain everything.  If I’m being completely honest, even I had forgotten why I was so insanely mad by that point.  I knew it something or other to do with Anastasia saying she had ‘misunderestimated’ me when I gave her back her blanket.  But how could I explain the significance of something like Anastasia’s blanket to Mr. Brigham?  That would force me talk about Sleep Points.  And I couldn’t do that.  The Sandman would know.  The Sandman would have my ass.

But, then again, I could probably still explain all of that without needing to bring up the blanket.  I could explain how I had corrected her on her grammar, and she just had to go off about how flawless her grammar usually was.  But even then, I’d have to explain why she had made the mistake, and then THAT would make me bring up Sleep Points.  Or maybe I wouldn't have to explain it.  People make mistakes, after all.  Even people like Anastasia.  Maybe it wouldn’t seem all that strange to him and he wouldn’t ask any further questions.

Shortly after thinking through all of that though, just when I was almost calmed down again, I had a tinge of terror.  For a moment, I almost thought I saw it, just out of the corner of my eye, just like I do when someone says its name.  But that couldn’t be.  No one had talked about The Sandman.  How could he be showing up NOW?  It didn’t make sense.  But things didn’t have to make sense, as I kept being reminded of again and again over the past two weeks.  Was The Sandman really prowling around, right then and there, listening in, to see if I would confess his existence to Mr. Brigham and the whole library?  I’d be a goner if I tried that.  Luckily, though, I was able to collect myself since I had a plan for how to respond to Mr. Brigham’s questions.

Or at least, I thought I did.  What really ended up happening was me stammering and spazzing out all over the place, all while just trying to keep my cool.  “W- well, look, Anastasia had, like, y’know, said something…” I trailed off.

“Well, what did she say that you thought was so disrespectful?” asked Mr. Brigham. 

“Well she had s-said something about h-how I-I couldn’t help with something… o-or she didn’t THINK…” I trailed off, feeling more and more humiliated as time dragged on, just wanting for the life of me to get out of this situation.

“What did she think you couldn’t help her with?” He asked.  Oh god.  Now I had really dug myself into a hole.  This had been all about Anastasia’s blanket and how I had forgetten to give it back to her the previous day.  And he couldn’t find out about THAT.  Then he’d ask why a blanket, of all things, mattered so much.  And then he’d know about The Sandman.

Fortunately, Anastasia chimed in with an explanation of her own before I could make too much of an even bigger ass of myself.

“I had previously stated that Morgan’s endeavors to assist me on our project pertaining to the Food Chain of the Florida Everglades would prove counterproductive.  I had greatly underestimated his capacity to help, but he insisted that he must contribute to our collective efforts.  This was, naturally, the motivation behind why he had so proudly proclaimed himself ‘stubborn’.  My glib dismissal of his competency has caused him great discontent, and for that I must apologize”, she said.

“Well, glad you said you were sorry.  But it’s HIS project too, y’know.  Let him help out a little.  I’m sure he’d be useful.  Morgan, here, looks like he’s got some serious drive.  You should give him a chance.  He could be a real asset,” said Mr. Brigham.

Anastasia looked me up and down for a moment, almost appearing to size me up a little.  

“I agree.  I thank you for your understanding,” she said.

“Glad I could sort this all out,” said Mr. Brigham, before casually heading back to his desk.

Phew.  Thanks to Anastasia’s explanation of events, she had just taken all the embarrassment away from me and deflected it all to her.  I took a quick glance around.  No Sandman in sight now.  The danger must've passed.  But the fact that he had managed to show up out of the corner of my eye even though I never once mentioned him still gave me the feeling that I could’ve been in some very real danger, just then.

After a couple more moments, once everything had more-or-less mellowed out, Anastasia talked to me again.  “I only wished to communicate to you my own difficulties falling asleep,” she explained, softly.  “Not to disparage the struggles you have faced to achieve the same task, but to help you understand that you are not alone in your adversity,” she explained.

I couldn’t help but believe her.  If anything, now I felt even worse than I did when everyone was watching me.  I felt like a colossal dick for insisting that she had to be this hugely narcissistic type of person, shouting her down and everything, all while she stayed completely cool the whole time.  Now that she taken on all the embarrassment that I had caused myself for yelling at her over nothing, I couldn’t help but get the sense that her intentions weren’t nearly as self-serving as I had thought.  She really did seem like she was only trying to help.  I thought she was just trying to cover her own ass by pretending like it, but the way she took the fall for me proved, pretty much beyond any shadow of a doubt, that she wasn’t bullshitting me.

“Listen, I just wanted to say I was sorry.  I know you’re not really trying to rub in how smart you are.  And hey, even if you were, you’d totally have every right to it,” I said.

“Thank you.  I, too, apologize for claiming that your efforts to assist me would do more damage than anything else.  My apology in front of Mr. Brigham was not for show.  I sincerely meant it.  Yesterday, a lack of sleep compromised my emotional state, just as yours was moments ago,” she said.  While it’s true that her saying I'd only do more harm than good wasn’t what I was really upset about when Mr. Brigham came walking over to our workspace, Anastasia had still said that exact thing in the past.  Granted, it had been a whole 24 hours since then.  Granted, I probably should’ve just gotten over myself by then.  But it still helped to hear her take back what she had said.  Plus, what she said after this made me feel even better.

“A lack of sleep,” Anastasia continued, “that I shall no longer suffer from, now that you have returned my blanket to me,” she explained.  Yes!  FINALLY I was able to do something that ACTUALLY helped.  It felt AMAZING to hear my crush thanking me like this.  

“These past few nights, I have had to lose consciousness through rather…”, she paused.  “Through rather unsavory means,” she said, with a voice lowered even further than before, as though she was about to tell me a pretty seriously dark secret.  

She was now whispering in my ear.  “I have had to become quite drunk,” she confessed, sounding thoroughly ashamed of herself.  I thought back to Saturday night, when I thought I had stepped in someone's puke.  And how relieved Anastasia seemed to look when I told her that it started to sting and wasn't just moist.  Maybe she really HAD puked in her own backyard at one point.

Shortly afterward she whispered, now in a very serious tone of voice, “Do not resort to such methods, Morgan.  You are only on Stage Two.  You must believe me: you are far, FAR away from having to resort to the methods that I do,” she said.  “Yes, yes.  PLEASE put your trust in me: you will not have to resort to the same drunkenness that I have had to rely on during these previous three nights for a very, VERY long time,” she said, desperately pleading that I don’t do what she’d been doing.

She looked like she was on the verge of tears.  As though she was about to have a fucking nervous breakdown.  And then she took a few breaths.   Some deep breaths.  In through her nose, out through her mouth.  And then she regained her usual composure.  She looked a lot more like the same stoic girl I always knew her to be.

She promptly changed the subject: “Would you like to organize the information I put together on our poster?” she asked.  We were working with a tri-fold poster board.  This meant that our poster had to have three sections, and it was up to us to decide how the poster would be split up into three parts.

“Well”, I said, taking a moment to think about how to split the food chain into three parts.  “I think we should probably put the main predators into a section of their own,” I suggested.  “Yeah, and then we should do pretty much the same thing for the main prey animals,” I said.  Now I had to think of what we wanted to do for the section in the middle.  “Yeah, okay, and for the section in the middle”, I said, taking a moment to think of what I should say next.  

“Right, yeah, so, for the section in the middle,” I was becoming increasingly panicked, just knowing that I was looking more and more like an absolute moron by the minute to Anastasia.  “Uh, so I guess we’ll just look like animal or plant-life somewhere in the middle.  Some kind of life-from that's neither predator or prey.  Animals and plants that can just…”, I trailed off.  “Just, like, be both, I guess,” I said, unsure of myself.  The bell rang.   

“That sounds like a good idea to me, Morgan,” said Anastasia.  Did she really mean it?  I had never known her to lie.  Even when I thought she was lying, she always told the truth.  I had always known her to be too brutally honest to lie.  She must’ve been telling the truth.  Even if she was willing to conveniently leave out information, I had never known her to lie directly.  She would never outright tell me a thing that wasn’t true.  Even if she was perfectly capable of not telling me what WAS true, she wouldn’t just tell me a thing that wasn’t.  She had never done that before.  “Why the hell would she start now?” I had to ask myself.

The day had come to a close.  Next up was seventh period.  I didn’t have anything due in English and there weren’t any projects for me to be working on, so it slipped by pretty seamlessly.  I didn’t have any homework that night, so I was totally planning on getting home and crashing.  With how difficult it felt like it was to stay awake throughout the day, I figured by that point, sleep would surely have to come more easily.

Truman tried catching up with me again on our way to the bus.  I was getting tired of him stopping me every afternoon to try and get me to talk.  But I guess I couldn’t be too mad since it wasn’t like he was trying to bully any info out of me or anything.  He was just casually walking up and asking.  Hell, I had tried doing the same thing to him a week or so earlier, expecting HIM to know something instead.  Much as I wasn’t too fond of Truman, the fact that I probably had basically everything to do with him joining Sleep Points really did weigh on my conscience.  

But I still never told him to look up the code on the post-it note.  He still did that on his own.  And anyway, all I was trying to do was survive Sleep Points myself.  I was only asking for help.  It wasn’t as if I had put the note there myself, carefully writing out each and every random character with the end goal of getting someone else to join.  But I did still kinda feel like I owed him.  Just because he still would’ve probably never started playing if it weren’t for me, whether I had anything to do with the note itself, or not.  Just bringing it up to him was bad enough.  But the problem was, I was pretty much as clueless as he was.  So I told him as much.

“Annie’s the only one who knows anything about our problems.” I told him.

“Dammit!”, said Truman, looking and sounding infuriated.

“I’ll bet that bitch is why I’m even in this fucking mess to begin with.  Why BOTH of us are dealing with this bullshit.” Truman went on.  “I mean just think about it.  I break up with her, and the next day you’re tellin’ me about that bullshit post-it note.” he said.  “I mean it all adds up right?  Musta been cuz I broke up with her.  And now she’s pullin’ THIS shit.  Bet that note was supposed to be for me.  And here you are, caught in the middle.  Honestly, I’m sorry.  I’d be pissed if I were you, Stanley.” Truman finished.

Truman was, of course, wrong on a few key facts.  First of all, I hadn’t found the note the day that I talked to him about it.  I had actually found it a few days prior to their breakup.  So that couldn’t’ve had anything to do with it.  And second of all, as I knew first-hand from being her partner in Environmental Science for the last week, Anastasia honestly couldn’t seem to care less about the breakup.  When I talked to her about it on Thursday, she seemed totally cool about it all.  Truman looked like the only one struggling to cope.  And he was the one to initiate the breakup in the first place.

“Y’know, it’s funny.  Because I actually found the note a couple days before you guys broke up,” I corrected him.   “Back on the 11th, pretty sure.  You guys broke up on the 14th, right?" I asked.

"Uh, yeah, Valentine's," he said.

"Plus, I dunno how to tell you this, but Annie’s been pretty cool about the whole breakup thing.  We’re working on a project together and I asked her about the two of you.  She seemed totally fine with it all,” I said.

“Bullshit.  She can deny for now, but she knows the truth.  She can’t keep it up forever,” he said, seeming like he was trying to convince himself even more than me.

“I dunno man.  But you seem like you’re takin’ it a lot worse.”  I pointed out.  

“Dude, I’ll be over her by like next week tops.” Truman insisted.

“I dunno.  Hasn’t it already been 2 weeks since the relationship broke off?” I pointed out.

“Don’t ya have a bus to catch, Stanley?” said Truman.  And in his defense, he was right.  The bus really was about to leave.  When I got to my seat, I noticed a little speck of snow on my watch.  I flicked the snowflake off, accidently tapping the face of my watch when I did so.  And, to my absolute horror, the face of my watch wasn’t the face of my watch anymore.  It was the face of none other than The Sandman.  

The usual numbers of the watch were now all gone.  The only numbers that showed up now were numbers on a timer.  A timer counting down the hours, minutes, and seconds until 6:00 AM on Thursday morning.  This was particularly strange because, aside from glowing in the dark, my College High watch worked the same as any other mechanical watch.  It didn't have any timer feature.  Aside from that, there was also one last other number, all by itself: a number 6.
