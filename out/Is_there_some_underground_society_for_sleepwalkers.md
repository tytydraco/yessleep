Look I know it’s a wild question to ask but I’ve been documenting very odd occurrences where I’m staying. It’s all been going well up until last night when I saw a sporadic line of what appears to be sleep-walking people heading towards the mountains at 1:00 A.M. The problem is, I woke up in a different bed.



For context, my name is Ted Mullaney and I work in freelance coding (with writing on the side) which allows me to do my job remotely from anywhere in the U.S. Lately, I’ve been on a sort of “work trip" (really I just chose to live here for a while) up to a little spot on the west coast . I’m staying in a nice two story micro-cabin I rented online for a few months and I’m on my 3rd day staying here. I sleep in the upstairs loft which contains two beds and a nightstand in the middle with an alarm clock resting on it. My room's gable window outlooks the north to see the highway intersecting the vast ocean on the left and the gradually rising mountains on the right. The only thing separating them besides the fog shrouded road is the looming trees that stand like monolithic creatures.



Yesterday I set out to explore a little in the morning. Walking a little more than I needed to, I found myself strolling through the village around 3.5 miles south from my place. The locals owning the small shops greeted the passing tourists with warm grins but when I introduced myself with the fact I was renting the cabin up the way, their friendly tourist-trapping smirks fell to forced smiles. This demeanor stayed with me in all of the shops until my eventual entry to an almost empty cafe called ‘Furry Rick’s Fuzzy Scones’. I sat down in a booth next to a table of a couple that looked worn from hiking. 



“Hi! Where are you coming from, stranger?” a young waitress energetically said as she wiped down the table to the left of the couple.



“Well I’m actually up here for a few months, I rented a cabin up the way but I won’t be pestering this little town too much.” I said, jokingly. 



She didn’t laugh at my joke. “You rented the McCluskey’s place up in Caramel point?” She said.



“Yeah, I mean I am just finding out it’s called Caramel point but yeah I got it from a Janine McCluskey. Do you know her?” 



“Yeah, those McCluskey’s – sad story. I don’t know if you know what happened up there but it’s something that shook this town up a little. Poor Janine-” She sighed a little as she obviously fought to keep her spirit high for the customers. I could see her nametag said manda but it looked as if there should have been an A in front of it. At this point, the couple with the matching rosy cheeks were listening in without any bashfulness. As I was about to, now very worryingly, ask what happened so that I know I’m not being haunted by some ghost of McCluskey someone started speaking.



“What happened to him?” The woman hiker asked. “We heard in the souvenir shop that someone mentioned that last name over there too. Something about a missing case.”



“Yeah, did someone go missing around here?” The man asked.



At this point I was sat there listening to a stolen conversation with Robert and Melissa, 2 hikers from SoCal who were just up here for a couple days at the campsite around the village. Amanda, now fully invested in telling the town’s tragedy that happened just one year before, sat down with the couple.



“Well this wasn’t really a missing person’s case as he had been seen by some of the townsfolk around 11 at night driving downwards with his station wagon. We all know it had been hard on the family after Janine’s mother had gone into a sort of dissociated state from the passing of their other daughter Lindsay. Anyway, apparently Ron just up and abandoned his catatonic wife and left his daughter to pick up the pieces of that poor family.”



“Jesus, what a horrible guy.” Said Robert. 



“Yea,” Amanda softly replied. “But anyway, a lot of the people around here were reminded of when Lindsay went missing because of Ron so it’s kind of been the talk of the town. News that big tends to stick around for a while in places like this.”



“I thought you said the daughter passed?” I said, finally being able to speak.



“Well everyone just assumes so. A 4-year-old girl goes missing in these woods, everyone searches for months but there’s a point where everyone has to come to assume what we didn’t want to.” Amanda stated.



The formerly lively couple and I had a long conversation about where we were coming from and what brought us specifically to this area of Oregon. I told them about my work and how I came up here for some inspiration for my new book and they were taunting my fearlessness of living alone for months because of the famous creature living in the woods. They explained to me what the villagers told them about the knock-off bigfoot that lurks around their woods, Furry Rick. We laughed about the large chimpish teeth stretched across his face in a smile in all of illustrations of him selling life jackets or strawberries.



A couple minutes after I told the couple to take care while they headed for the exit, Amanda came up to me again asking if I wanted my coffee filled.



“Hey you guys are a real big tourist spot huh?” I asked.



“Well we could survive without it but it’s nice to see road tripping families traveling up the coast so we like to put on a show.” 



“Yeah with Furry Rick” I teased.



She childishly smiled at the name. “Yeah he’s our guy. Our own little chupacabra.”



She acted out her routine to me about the inspiring tale of their first mayor who fought off a large beast with his eyes closed because the giant monkey was so handsome it blinded him. 



We both chuckled about this until I noticed I’ve been in town for around 2 and a half hours so I said my farewell and headed home.



Walking back on the road, I was glad the morning fog thinned out so I could see the less daunting thicket around me. This lack of mist, though, allowed me to see the track I followed to the village. The fresh prints of boots scattered towards my cabin which was fine at the time but as I got closer to my house, I noticed the boot prints weren’t straying away from it. They moved closer to my front door. My boots matched into the shallow impressions left behind from someone else as I raced towards the entrance. I swung the door open to see nothing at all. After taking a few steps into the house and calling out to the small rooms, I circled back outside to wipe my shoes off on the doormat and that’s when I saw them. 



Symbols slashed into the trees faced towards the house. You know when you land wrong on the trampoline and your heart drops to your balls? My heart was in hell. It felt like I was frozen for hours. I spoke to Janine online and I don’t think she would've left this detail out. I didn’t notice them when I got here for the first time nor when I left earlier that morning. I write fiction, I know my horror and I know that I should’ve gotten into my car and drove. But I didn’t. The symbols confused me. Carvings like arrows and dots pointed all around the trees and eyes stared back at me. The thing is, I’ve seen carvings on trees in movies before but not like this. All of the depressions were filled in with a yellow substance. As I finally got the courage to walk closer to one of them, I scratched at the matte yellow material and my finger dug in. It was wax. 



I forgot about my fear as I sprinted up the spiral staircase to the loft where my computer sat on my bed. Immediately trying to look up what they were, I couldn’t find anything with my searches and gave up quickly. I know this should be the end and I know that this is immediately a nope situation but what happened that night is going to keep me here for all my stay. I need to search for more.



I was all packed up and ready to leave the next day but I couldn’t sleep. Who could sleep after that? I just wish I had gone to bed.



It wasn’t until 1:00 in the morning until I saw them. My stomach was burning from staying up that late. Sweat beaded down my head as I got more and more nervous for every twig broken around the cabin. I sat on the edge of my bed and noticed something, or more accurately someone, passing by in the mist outside of my window. On the side of the road, I saw a man with a graying beard and salt and pepper hair lumbering at a slow pace. The arched man appeared to be looking up at something, his arms hung behind. As he walked away I noticed his mouth was creaked open and his eyes closed. He was sleepwalking. I wasn’t too afraid at the moment as he seemed to avoid my cabin.



Confused, I walked downstairs to go outside and saw another outside the large glass window. 



This was an older woman, head suspended down and arms falling forwards. She seemed to be saying something at random intervals. I walked outside into the cold forest’s shroud and tied my arms around my waist to conserve my heat. I approached the woman to hear her quiet babbles. This one was speaking. I’ve always wanted something to happen in my life. I’ve prayed for something to happen in my life. Not something like this. She stopped in her tracks and stood at attention. She slowly turned back to me and beckoned me closer.



As I backed up I watched the old woman turn around again and slump forward to go to her destination. As I spun on my heel, I walked right into another person going to the same destination. 



“OH MY GOD. I’m so sor-.” I exclaimed, not being mentally ready for that.



The fallen woman sat on the cement for a while then got up to the point where I could see her face. It was Amanda. She smiled, still with her eyes closed, said sorry and kept walking.

“Amanda right? Right?”



She kept walking and didn’t stop for me.



“Amanda, where are you all going? Should I follow?”



I knew that you were never supposed to wake up a sleepwalker but I finally know why. I tried tapping on her shoulder to try to get her to wake up but she spun towards me and yelled in my face.



“STOP FOLLOWING US. GO BACK AND CLOSE THEM.”



I sprinted back. On the way I saw 2 more coming closer. I could see way more in the mist. Where were they all going?



I jumped up the three stairs that lead to my front door and shut everything. *Close them* I thought. I slammed all of the doors shut and put sheets over all of the windows. I finally stepped back to view my now inky dark house. But it wasn’t fully pitch black. There was moonlight seeping in. In, through the loft window. I wish I fell asleep. I walked slowly up the spiral staircase, hoping I wouldn’t see any more sleepwalkers outside my window. I didn’t see the sleepwalkers, however. I saw where they were going. A flame lit up the side of the mountain, revealing a concrete staircase hidden underneath the brush. Holding the lantern and leading their sleeping followers was a large dark figure.



I’ve never seen anything so disturbing.



I was eventually able to pass out on my bed. I felt safe in my cabin for once that night. I fell on the right twin bed in the loft. I usually love dreams of feelings and colors as opposed to story type dreams but this “feeling” dream was horrid. Nightmarish feelings of my body being used as a puppet and a weakness breaking me down made me feel as if the dark being was making its way from my feet, into my spinal cord, and up to my brain. I woke up horribly with a bad taste in my mouth and a sore throat. The left bed from the window was cold. The sheets were made up almost perfectly. I’m not crazy but I’ve never moved in my sleep. I immediately grabbed my computer and typed this all out.



If anyone has ANY advice please tell me. I know it’s annoying and I know this sounds stupid but that night changed me. I’m staying here. I need to know what it was. I feel even more stupid because looking back on this I’m not scared; I’m excited to find out. I’m going to head into town today to try and ask Amanda or anyone what it all meant. Maybe later I’ll find that staircase.



Please help me find out what this all means. 



Please help me find this society of sleepwalkers.
