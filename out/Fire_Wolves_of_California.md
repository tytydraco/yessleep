I stopped laughing when I realized the two academics, the two *scientists*, were quite serious.

"Wildfires start with a mere spark, just a little heat on dry kindling and the race is on." Professor Gregore iterated meaningfully. We all knew what they meant, but what they were talking about wasn't just the simple fact they had stated.

"You are both quite serious." I said quietly, hearing the surprise and awe in my voice.

"Indeed. This is the solution we came up with." Doctor Pincher assured me. I thought for a long time, as they stared at me. It was possible, I'd seen dogs trained to put out small fires, but the animal invariably got burns for their efforts. Nature had made wolves terrified of fire for a good reason. They weren't equipped to handle it. Or were they?

"It just sounds so ridiculous. The closest pack to the latest wildfires is *Yowlumni*, and they live all the way up in Tulare. And that's just our first logistical hurdle. You realize that they can only put out a small grass fire, and that's it. Anything bigger than that is beyond them. By the time the pack reaches any sparks, perhaps miles away, it will be a fire too big for them to handle." I tried to reason with them, but they shook their heads sadly at me, like I just wasn't getting it.

"Wolves teach their young, and when new packs are formed, old skills are retained. Our efforts will carry on, becoming a legacy. If they can stop even one catastrophic fire, what we do will be more than worth it." Doctor Pincher said, really believing in the cause.

"So, you want my wolves. That's really why you are here. You've already worked out how you are going to condition them and I bet you've even got something worked out with Fish and Wildlife about releasing my wolves back into the wild. You've got this whole thing all sorted out, then, and all you need are the actual wolves." I sighed. I wasn't going to let the two quacks anywhere near my wolves.

"Actually, it isn't exactly so simple. We've already gone way above you on all that." Professor Gregore smiled weirdly, that California politician smile, the one that made me want to move back to Oregon where there are still good Christian Americans, and not whatever I'd say populates California.

"What do you mean?" I stood, feeling a little angry. I already sensed they were about to seize my operation for their own insane plot.

"These are orders from the concerned departments, legality of your operation, and the signature of the governor." Doctor Pincher slid a folder across the table to me. I flipped it open and saw that they were taking my wolves and my operation away from me, with or without my help in their plans.

"I see." I said, bitterness in my voice. Then I added, impulsive and angry: "I can't wait to see you get mauled."

They chuckled and made me sign that I was aware of their operation and intended to cooperate. In return for signing for the devil, my soul was granted access to my wolves as their caretaker during their upcoming training montage. Somehow that song, 'Holiday' by Green Day, became my personal anthem, even though I used to hate that kind of music, especially Green Day. Weird that their music got me through that very rough chapter in my life.

I had worse enemies to hate, and my wolves hated them too. It is unnatural for a wolf to approach a fire. They nipped at me while I treated their burns, but they knew me and let me get close. Anyone else would have had to use sedatives to put ointment on a wolf's burned paw.

It only took two years before the results were satisfactory. I reminded myself I was forced to do this to my wolves, as a feeling of pride arose within me. The demonstration had a lot of department officials and government and the Governor was also there. A few small fires were started in the fire department's outdoor burn laboratory. My wolves were released, and with coordinated movement that rivalled a team of Navy Seals, they went to work.

When the fires were out, their singed paws from patting the flames, the dust all over their fur from digging and throwing dirt onto the flames - didn't bother them. They howled in unison, a different howl I'd never heard before, victorious and free. There was an applause. I felt light-headed.

As we drove them out to the national forest they would soon call home, a kind of melancholy fell over me. I felt depressed, depleted and unfulfilled. My life choices had led me to that road, delivering wolves raised in captivity, used to feeding on delivered roadkill, to a place that hadn't had wolves in over a hundred years.

We set up camp and prepared to release them. I planned to stay two nights in observation, documenting the release. Doctor Pincher and Professor Gregore were with me, as well as a few interns of theirs.

There wasn't a fire ban, but I would have cautioned everyone not to have a campfire that night. We had taught the wolves that putting out fires was a meet and greet for prey, and they had no fear of humans. I'd say they were also somehow resentful for being forced to put out numerous fires, and remembered all their painful burns.

While the interns built a campfire, I wasn't in camp, I was watching my wolves as they sniffed their new home. They hadn't gone far, and they were watching the humans, while I watched them, licking their lips.

That is when I began to feel afraid. I'd never seen them in the wild, and as my prisoners, I treated them like guests. When the state showed up, the wolves became tools, firefighting tools. I'd never seen them as wild animals. No ordinary animals, however, but completely disenchanted by Man and his Fire, and aware of our weaknesses.

My fear began slowly, with realizations about the nature of wolves and the gradual realization of what we had created. You see, in the wild, wolves don't hunt a herd and kill indiscriminately. They are highly methodical and intelligent, far smarter than lions. In places where there are wolves, big cats invariably decline or go extinct, because wolves simply outsmart them.

No, you see, to a wolf, the herd is her herd. It belongs to her, and her mate and her cubs and any subordinates she has kept in the pack. They care for the herd, driving away other predators and only killing and eating a few of the herd, focusing slaughter on the old or injured so the overall health of the herd actually increases as the wolves cull for food. They have done this for a very long time.

In our world there are lies, but in their world, there is only truth.

From those thoughts of mine, those emotions, I stared at the wolves with new eyes. Wide and terrified. I realized what we had done, what these were. They were no longer wolves, not like any other wolf. I was afraid, holding a camera with trembling hands as I watched, frozen in fear.

Then, as the sun began to set, they howled. It was that same howl, but this time it chilled my bones, it was terse and carried that note, the tonal shift from victory to anticipation. They weren't celebrating just yet, no, that was a very happy howl. If I had to translate the lyrics or their song, I'd say it was similar to "Holiday" by Green Day, only in wolf language. I was very afraid, for those were no longer wolves, they were something else entirely. Wolves don't do what they did. This has never happened before.

I wanted to return to camp, to warn everyone of the terrible danger they were in, but I was too afraid. I stayed in the blind, thankful they had decided to ignore me, for surely they were aware of my presence. Luckily for me they had smelled me every day of their life, and my scent meant nothing to them.

The smell of fire, though? That had them particularly excited. Fire was their prey, fire was what they tended to, fire was the trespasser - the enemy. And unlike wolves, these creatures were not afraid of fire. If I had to summarize the result of what we had done to them, I'd say they were insane.

I heard someone screaming as I watched the wolves enter the camp, like moving in for the coup de gras. That way they trotted, tails straight, eyes rolling, tongues side hung, teeth flashing. That exact expression means they are in kill mode.

The screaming was hurting my ears, and then I realized I was the one screaming. Terror had overwhelmed me at what I was witnessing. I had lost the settled part of my mind, and everything was in prehistoric turmoil. Some ancestor in my blood filled me with energy so that I had to start flailing or running, I couldn't sit there.

I headed for the camp, panic and dread making my dash wild. From my position where I was filming I could see the wolves and the camp, but as I went down the hill through the bushes and trees I could see nothing. Until I saw their glowing yellow eyes.

The glowing yellow eyes of the fire wolves, reflecting the orange flames and the red blood. I stared, and they looked back, with nothing but a veil of night between us. Would they kill me too? I did not know. They circled me in the dark, while I sweated and breathed and palpitated.

I was so afraid that it felt like time had stopped completely. Maybe I knelt there, on my knees, weeping in terror in the darkness for the whole night, or maybe it was just a few minutes. I knew what they had done, the campers were all strewn about, eliminated by powerful jaws and precise throat-tearing bites. I could vaguely see the dark shapes that were all the bodies.

Professor Gregore was crawling towards me gurgling something at me. I just stared, barely recognizing them. The wolves watched our interaction, deciding my fate. I refused to help, just staying there, as the last camper died.

This seemed to satisfy the wolves, and they departed in near silence, leaving behind their oppressors, their enemies, all dead. I let out an exhale, shaking and whimpering in the aftermath of such horror.

I made a decision, as I went to the remains of Professor Gregore and found the keys to the truck. I was just going to leave everything as it was, not report anything. It would be a while before anyone got out here, if anyone ever did, and without my testimony, there would only be wild speculation about what happened.

They had left it all behind, for as I rolled up the window to the cold of the night, I heard them, off in the distance. They would remain a part of this forest, and people would go missing, and fires would be put out. They had a job to do, a job we had given them.

I'm sure they are still out there. The rangers in that forest have issued a permanent burn ban, and it's best if it is obeyed. The wolves respond to fire.

The wolves have got this.
