My name is James Connor , I'm a commander at UDA (Unnatural Detainment Association) in the CED (Cultist Eradication Department) so you can just call me commander Connor. 


I was just chilling at the UDA office , We at the CED do not have much to do unless something about the cult is reported.


We suddenly got a notification about the sighting of someone suspicious at [an old cult base](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/kuVNAluyjP). I took 4 of my men and went there. We were equipped with some basic armour and an assault rifle. 


As soon as we reached there, Everything seemed just the same as it was last time. The building seemed abandoned , As if nobody had entered it in months. 


I quietly sneaked in and made sure nobody was in the corridors , I signalled the others to come in after me. I could hear some sort of voice , So we went in the direction it was coming from.


We reached the room the voice was coming from , The voice was now clearer and I could make out what it was saying. It seems a man was talking to someone....or something.


"Look at you! Without offerings from the cultists , You've been reduced to a dead branch!" the man said.


A heavy growl followed afterwards.


I took a quick peek , The man was indeed talking to what seemed to be a dead branch. But branches don't growl.


"Isn't that Jason? One of the guys we're looking for?" One of the men whispered from behind.


I didn't realise it before since I could only see the man from behind , But his profile did match. 


"Either way , We have to take this guy out. He doesn't seem to be up to anything good ,Â  Stand back and let me take the shot." I whispered back 


I got my assault rifle ready , I spotted a hole in the wall and started aiming for the man's head.


"I have a simple deal for you. Become a part of me , I'll let you feed off others I kill. Do you accept?" the man asked to the branch. 


It was followed by another growl , But this one was lighter than the one before. I was about to take the shot when one of my men stopped me.


"And lose the chance at promotion? Hell no. Let's go in boys." He whispered and went in.


The 4 went in through the door and pointed their guns at them while yelling "HANDS UP"


The man turned around and put his hands up , His face was clearly visible now and it was clear that he was Jason.


"Wanna know something? The cultist book was wrong. You don't need meat to form a pact , You just need the Unnatural to agree." Jason said while smiling.


"Well , Too bad dead people can't form pacts!" one of them yelled. 


Jason started laughing before yelling 
"Custodi me et esto mihi custos. Hic contractus manebit donec unus ex nobis pereat" 


The branch behind Jason suddenly went flying into his back....and so did the rest of the branch's body from the ground. 


The men finally shot at him , But it was too late. 2 tentacles emerged from his back blocking all the bullets , 2 more energed from the back and grabbed 2 of the men. Then smashed them together , Leaving only a bloody mess. 


The other 2 men kept shooting , But it was no use. Jason impaled them with his tentacles as well. 


"That's what you get for interrupting me." he said to the bodies.


I took the shot , But I missed and hit his shoulder instead. Jason screamed in agony before sending one of his tentacles towards my direction.


It broke through the wall , I barely made it out of the way. He wasn't attacking me anymore, Seems like the shoulder getting hit had some significant damage on him.


I thought of finishing him off. But.....my legs.....they froze in place. Had I taken damage? No.... Reality finally set in. That man just killed 4 of my men like bugs, I'll die if I go back. My legs weren't frozen because I was injured , They were frozen because I was terrified. 


I ran back to the car and drove away , Jason doesn't seem to be following me. Reporting the incident to prepare is all I can [do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnnaturalUniverse/s/I9uk1PqyPi)
