Shit.

I can’t call the cops, obviously – there are several problems with that. And Eric’s family wouldn’t believe me if I told them the truth. 

So I’m going to bare my soul with anonymous internet users, because I need to tell someone and I don’t give a shit what any of you thinks about me. 

Yeah, Eric and I were professional burglars. You probably think that makes us shitty people, but how is that any different from the insurance companies who replace what we take?

Anyway, we were at this gargantuan house that had more than it needed. At least, Eric and I thought so. Without getting too specific, it’s out on the West Side of L. A., and the owners wouldn’t be hurting if they lost a few thousand bucks worth of their material possessions. 

It’s not that bad. We never act while someone’s home.

At least, not intentionally. 

We’d done enough reconnaissance to feel sure that the house at 1913 I’ll-keep-the-street-name-to-myself Avenue. It’s amazing what neighbors will overlook if you act like you own the place. Would you call the cops if a well-dressed person you didn’t recognize walked into the front yard of the house three doors down? 

So we’re in the house just after sunset. We always worked as a pair – each of us had gotten the other out of some shit when things went sideways. Eric went into a bedroom while I stayed in the doorway, keeping one eye on the windows and hall with the other on the dark room. We don’t use flashlights, because that screams “I’m stealing shit.” He was looking around for the light switch when I froze.

Someone was in the bed. 

I was about to tell him that we needed to GTFO when their eyes opened. Something was very, very *off*. This person’s entire body was obscured in darkness, but their eyes were bright white, like they were their own light source. 

They stared directly at me. 

I got the feeling that this person would pounce if I said anything, so I just stood there without moving. *Fuck*, that was a terrible stretch of time – all I knew was that every possible outcome was going to be horrible, and this thing in the bed was waiting for me to decide when and how I was going to experience the awfulness.

Eric was still fumbling around in the dark. The tension dripped like a frozen molasses-shit sundae, but he was completely oblivious. I prayed that he would just back away.

“I found the light switch,” Eric announced. 

There’s no turning off the spigot once you start pissing your pants, but that was the least of my worries. I opened my mouth to plead with him just as the room was flooded in light. 

The thing in bed was a kid – maybe seven years old.

And he did not like the light.

His eyes turned jet black as he flew to the corner of the room. He didn’t land on the floor, but the wall itself; he stuck to it like a spider. Then his arms and legs moved fast – way too fast, *impossibly* fast – as he scuttled up to the goddamn ceiling.

That’s when the door closed by itself.

For a second, I didn’t do a damn thing.

Then Eric started freaking out. “Mac – hey, what the fuck is going on-” here he rattled the door in its frame. The knob twisted frantically back and forth fast enough to tell me that Eric was fighting against an unmovable lock. “Mac, get me the fuck out of here – hey – HEY DON’T TOUCH ME-”

*slam*

The door shuttered in its frame.

I stood in silence for a moment.

“MAC!”

I took a step forward before freezing once more.

“GET OFF OF ME!”

I didn’t move.

“PLEASE DON’T!”

Have you ever slurped Jell-O through your teeth before hitting a grape? Imagine a hippopotamus doing that. I’ve got no other way to describe what I was hearing. 

*SNAP*

And I knew breaking bones when I hear it.

*SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP*

Eric’s scream emptied what was left in my bladder. It wasn’t just the loudness that chilled my shit; no, the sheer desperation in his voice rattled my soul. He screamed the dread of a man who knows he’s dying mixed with the despair of a small child begging for a mother who’s abandoned him.

I reached a tentative hand for the knob, leaned back, and turned it.

I’ll be honest: I was relieved when I found it to be locked. I jumped back like I’d been burned. 

It gave me an excuse to keep myself safe while my friend died.

There was a momentary silence after his moans stopped. 

Then I heard a child’s footsteps. They pattered across the floor.

Then up the wall.

I listened as the thing scampered along the bedroom ceiling, the walls thin enough so that I could hear each tiny footfall. 

The doorknob turned.

That’s when I finally got my shit together and ran. I didn’t look back, but I felt someone behind me in the same way our ears pick up on a silent person two inches behind our head. Not caring who saw me, I burst out of the door and ran down the driveway, hopping into my car and driving home without Eric. 

His wife wants to know where he is. She filed a missing person report with the cops. 

She knows I’m lying when I say I don’t know where to find him. 

The worst part, though, is trying to sleep. All the damn creaking noises in my house are different now. When I listen closely, it’s becoming clearer that they’re [tiny footsteps](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
