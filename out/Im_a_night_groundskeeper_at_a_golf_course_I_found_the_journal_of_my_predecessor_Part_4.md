Where it all began [Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xp8u2e/im_a_night_groundskeeper_at_a_golf_course_i_found/)

I opened the door of my small security booth and was surprised to see that no one was there, that is until I looked down. There standing on my doorstep was a child no more than nine. He stood with his weight shifted on one leg and had his arms crossed as he tapped his foot. His small baseball hat bobbed up and down as he fidgeted.

“Uhm, can I help you little guy? You lost?” I asked, I crouched to get face to face with him.

“Yeah, lost my fucking mind. I thought you Auditors were to be professionals, yet here I stand talking to what is obviously an ape in a human costume.” He said.

“The fuck..” I mumbled, getting up from my crouched position.

“Yeah, I’m just as disappointed. The other guy wasn’t half as patronizing.” 

“Who are you?” I asked.

“I’m the guy that needs you to shut the fuck up and listen to instructions, maybe after you prove yourself more useful than a household pet I’ll give you my name. Don’t bother giving me yours, I’ll just call you dog from now until you earn my respect.”

The kid turned and walked away from me. I was aghast to say the absolute least. I didn’t know who the fuck this little brat thought he was, but I wasn’t anybody’s damn dog. So I stood there inside the door and watched him take a few steps away from the booth until he stopped.

“I told you to come, Dog.”

A wave of nausea washed over me in an instant. I doubled over and emptied my breakfast, lunch, and dinner all over the booth. I had never felt so much vertigo in my life. My head was spinning so much so that my balance left me and I slipped and fell into my own vomit, coating myself head to toe.

“Haha, you know what dogs do with their vomit?” The kid asked.

All of a sudden my body started to move on its own. Somehow my movements were going in reverse. I un-slipped on my vomit and was pulled back up into the position I had been in before the nausea started. All the while the contents of my stomach were being sucked back up. I could feel the now lukewarm bile and chunks of wet food slide back into my mouth and down my throat. 

I doubled over once more and held my stomach. All I could think about was the wet semi solid mass off half digested food sliding back down inside me. I could almost feel it happening again as I replayed it over and over in my mind. Making me eject the gritty contents of my stomach for a second time.

“What the hell was that?!” I managed to squeeze out after I finished vomiting.

“That was a warning. It’s a lot worse coming out the other end. Now hurry along.”

The boy began waking and I quickly followed. I wanted to ring his little neck, but I thought better of it. I didn’t want to find out what the hell he meant by the other end.

To my surprise instead of heading deeper into the gulf course he went right past the gate and walked out onto the street. I hadn’t thought that these denizens could actually leave the golf course. I guess it wasn’t outside the scope of logic, because of what happened to Fry and the tape recorder.

“Where are we going?” I asked.

“Ugh, the store Dog, and make sure you stay three paces behind so I don’t have to smell you.” The boy said.

“Why? Don’t they have food wherever you’re from? Cause, I doubt you're actually a little boy with that shit you just pulled back there.”

“Wow, it has eyes. Of course I’m not a damn child, though what I am is of no concern to you. And yes, we do have food, just not what I’m after.”

“How the hell can you just leave the golf course though? I thought everything weird just kinda stayed inside?”

“That’s where you come in. Almost all the denizens can’t survive one step outside the gate, lucky for you, because if we could your world would have been over a very long time ago. We need a catalyst to leave.” 

“So what? Would you vanish if I got too far away from you?”

“After a while yeah, but there are ways of surviving after you lose contact with a catalyst.”

“So you’re like a leach?”

Just as the words left my mouth I felt a deep rumbling in my stomach. The kind of rumbling where you need to hold the bottom of your ass while you run to a bathroom. 

“A what?” The boy asked.

“Nothing! I misspoke!” I shouted.

“Don’t let it happen again.”

Whatever was doing back flips in my stomach slowly faded as we walked on. After a while I thought it was safe enough to continue my questioning. Being more careful with my word choice of course.

“Don’t people come and go everyday? Why don’t you guys just hitch a ride on one of them?” I asked.

“Not just anyone will do. It needs to be someone that knows about us and is a willing ferry. Even then, not many of the lower beings can even manage that.”

“Well I guess you guys have a funny definition of willing. I damn sure didn’t sign up for this.”

“Oh, but you did. You’re an Auditor and you are willing by default. You should really be careful when you leave. Be sure to wipe your feet on the way out. Wouldn’t want any nasties out in the world.”

We walked for a bit more until we got to the local drug store just a few blocks away from the golf course. We entered and the kid went straight to the clerk. Apparently they knew each other because the clerk handed the kid a small brown paper bag without saying a word. The kid handed him something in return, but I didn’t see what it was. We exited the store and started making our way back to the golf course.

“Now I may be an old man, but I know a drug deal when I see one.” I said.

“Very perceptive for a dog.” The kid shot back.

“What, they don’t have weed where you come from?”

“No, and it’s not weed in the bag.”

“Well what is it?”

“It’s something for the pain. You’ll see in a short while, the night’s not over yet.”

As we walked I could see a pair of headlights up ahead and slowly closing the distance between us. The kid got closer to me and to my surprise even grabbed my hand as we walked. His hand felt warm clasped in my own, I’m not sure why I was surprised by this. Maybe him being something other than human automatically made me think of him as a monster. I just couldn’t imagine a monster with such small and warm hands. I held him tight and pulled him in closer as we walked along.

I could see that it was a police car and my heart started to race a bit. A grown man walking the streets at night with a 9 year old boy wasn’t exactly a good look. I tried to just keep my head down and walk, hoping the cop would just pass us by, but the closer he got the more I could hear him slowing down. The old breaks of his cruiser made an eerie squeak as he cruised along the street. I could feel his eyes on us while mine were fixated on the pavement. I didn’t want to draw any unwanted attention, but the holes I could feel burning into me as his gazed drew near made it apparent that wasn’t going to happen.

The cops' tires cried out for the last time as he finally stopped. I turned to meet his expectant gaze, but just before I could I felt a tug at my jacket sleeve. I looked down at the boy. His deep brown eyes staring up at me. For the first time since we’ve met I saw him smile. He wore a wide grin and began jumping up and down as he pointed to the policeman. 

“Daddy, daddy look! It’s a police car!” The kid said excitedly.

“It sure is son. Why don’t you wave to the nice policeman.” I said, not missing a beat.

The kid smiled and waved and so did I, finding that the smile he wore was now plastered onto my face also. For a moment I felt something. Call it nostalgia or maybe even happiness, but that smile and those eyes, I’m not sure, but it didn’t seem like the boy was faking it. At that moment I’m not sure I was either.

That is until reality came crashing down knocking me out of whatever dreamland stupor I had been in. Instead of the cordial face of a public peace officer, what I saw was a gray colored wall of skin looking back at me. There were no facial features to speak of. Only a smooth surface where a face should have been

I pulled the boy even closer to me. It took all I had to keep a smile plastered on my face and my hand waving in the air. The thing just waved its hand at us, gave me a slight nod and drove on. It wasn’t until the car had rounded the corner did the boy let go of my hand. He wiped it on his shirt before speeding up his pace to get ahead of me. So much for our little moment I guess.

“What the fuck was that!” I yelled in a whisper.

“A mimic. Not a very good one either.” 

“Where the fuck did it come from?” I asked.

“Probably latched onto you before we left. I told you to wipe your damn feet.”

“How the fuck do I even do that? How the hell am I supposed to tell if a damn ghost is caught on my foot or not.”

“Just check, you’ll catch on soon enough.”

“So what do we do about that thing? Will it kill people if it’s just left to run loose?”

“Yeah, probably that is how a mimc subsists after disconnecting with a catalyst. I mean if you had a gun you could have shot it, but I wouldn’t suggest taking it on hand to hand, or at all. Just let nature take its course.”

“Me? You’re the one with the freaky vomit, time powers and shit. Couldn’t you like, make its head explode or something?”

“Ahh, that only works on humans and quit your whining it’ll be dead in less than a week. You saw how it looked. How long do you think until people find out about it and kill it?”

“Well wouldn't people investigate and find out about the golf course?” I asked.

“Again, that's where you come in. You either tell them to fuck off or make sure they can’t go fuck off. Look, if you wanna go ghost hunting go for it, but do that shit on your own time. We got more work to do.”

I followed the kid back to the golf course and we made our way to hole 4. Hole 4 wasn’t anything all that special, it was actually one of the more hated holes on the course. There was a slight bend to the green right next to the cup that would send balls wide to the right where a swampy pool of water lay in wait.

They say if you're putting hole 4 on the green, you're putting it in the stream. I never was one for golfing so I didn’t live the frustration myself. I did however misplace a few steps while walking past and almost ended up in the water if the kid hadn’t grabbed me just in time.

“Thanks haha. Getting wet tonight wasn’t on the memo.” I said.

“The last thing you wanna do is get in that water.”

The kid's voice was slurred. A far cry from the uppity and large vocabulary he had before. I saw that he had dropped the brown bag and it lay before his feet between us. The kid was swaying back and forth on shaky legs, it looked like he was about to fall down, but he somehow managed to stay upright. 

He stared at the water with low hung eyes. He breathed deeply in and out like he was preparing for something. Then he walked into the water. It was only about two and half feet, but because he was so small the water came up to just below his waist.

He stood there in the water just looking at me, I didn’t say a word. He winced a few times before he suddenly sunk to chest level and bobbed back up like a buoy. Except that his entire lower body was gone. His intestines floated lazily out of the gaping hole where his legs had been. The water now tainted a deep red where the blood oozed out of him and mixed with it.

He never said a word. Just floated there, still breathing, although now his breaths were more labored. I could see the wetness pooling in the corners of his eyes reflecting off of the moonlight as he stared into the sky. He made a slight moan as his eyes began retreating back into his skull deeper and deeper until they were gone completely. 

The clouds overtook the moon along with the faint light that it gave off and we were shrouded in darkness and silence. I felt sorry for the kid even if he was a being not from this world, and an asshole, he still looked like a child. When he grabbed my hand I felt a feeling I hadn’t felt in a very long time and when I looked at him and smiled I think there was a hint of sincerity in it.

I don’t know why he had to die like this. Or really why any of the freaky shit around here happens the way that it does. I do know that seeing a child die is never easy, doesn’t matter how many times you’ve seen it. I had to push those thoughts out of my mind, now wasn’t the time for that.

I stood there and waited until the clouds parted and the moon once again showered me in its light. The boy wasn't there anymore. The only thing left was a red pool that waded down the stream and into the filters below.

I grabbed the brown paper bag he had dropped and walked back to my booth. When I got back I opened the bag to find two empty medicine bottles, one was labeled Hydrocodone, the other was Codeine. I shoved the bottles in the trash and grabbed the journal from the dresser. Maybe a tale from my predecessor would keep the creeping thoughts in my mind at bay.

The next entry reads as follows:

*The Woodsman looked me up and down and then back at the fire. Through his grizzled beard and wrinkled skin I could see he had a sullen look about him. Like he was sad to see I had come or maybe it was that I had to in the first place.*

*The Woodsman had his hands up like he was trying to get warm by the fire, but I could see almost the opposite was true. As his hands waved in front of him, so did the fire and all its wondrous colors. They were in a dance of sorts, like a tango, moving as one but separate all the same.*

*When he drew breath the fire grew bigger and the colors inside took on deeper hues with some changing entirely. Once he exhaled the fire lay dormant again and the colors returned to their original state.*

*I could only watch in awe at what I was witnessing. Not only to the beautiful display of colors, but to the Woodsman himself. I could feel a warmth emanating from him. Oddly enough, it seemed to me I had felt this kind of warmth before. Like being tucked in by your parents at bedtime or a warm glass of milk in the middle of the night. There was a comfort to the man that was almost nostalgic in nature.*

*The Woodsman lifted his hands into the air and the fire came with them. High into the air the fire raged. It almost looked like it would become out of control and for a moment the image of the gulf course engulfed in fire and ash crossed my mind. It was a nice thought. Only stopped by the intense heat I felt consumed me while I watched the Woodsman try and tame the fire down into a lantern just beside him.*

*Once the struggle was over the Woodsman took the lantern and latched it onto his belt. He stood up from the smoldering embers and faced me. His towering figure was imposing.*

*“I-I’m guessing you're the Woodsman?” I stammered.*

*“Far as I know.” He said with a smile.*

*He extended his hand to me and I shook it. I felt a warmth much like the fire. I could almost see those same vibrant colors.* 

*“Uhh, mind letting go?” He asked.*

*I looked down to see that my hand was still firmly grasped onto his. I quickly withdrew my hand in embarrassment.*

*“Haha. Sorry about that.” I said sheepishly.*

*“Ahh, it’s alright. Don’t worry about it.”*

*“I- uhh need your help Mr. Woodsman.”*

*“Please, Mr. Woodsman was my father. Call me Montey.”*

*“Alright Montey. I was told to come here That you could help me?”*

*“Yeahhh, I heard you were on your way, but I got some bad news, kid. I can’t really do anything for you.”*

*“What? I thought you could help? I went through a lot to get here Montey, please. I don’t know what else to do.”*

*“Well just because I can’t help doesn’t mean you don’t have any options. I have to warn you though,they aren’t very good options.”*

*“I guess I don’t have much choice.”*

*“Well alright. The first one is to just stay here and keep doing our job. The One Who Sings is pretty picky and if he thinks he can get to you easily then he won't go after your loved ones. Uh, you do have loved ones right?”*

*“Yes, I have loved ones.”*

*“Oh alright, good. Or not good I guess.” Montey offered an awkward laugh before he kept talking.*

*“The second option would be to use that fancy watch of yours and try and take the fight to him, but I don’t recommend it.”*

*“I’m not sure about that. I don’t even know what the hell this thing actually does.”*

*“You don’t know? I thought he would have given you something like an instruction manual or something.”*

*“Nope. I think that's what you're supposed to be.”*

*“Ahh, makes sense. Sooo that watch actually controls all of the denizens that inhabit this golf course.”*

*“Is that why the tree things helped me after I pushed a button on it?”*

*“The Watchers? Nah, they just don’t like that thing that was chasing you. The wind was actually because of the watch… I think.”*

*“You mean I can control the wind?”*

*“I mean yeah, I guess… I don’t know.” Montey shrugged.*

*“Wow, thanks man.” I rolled my eyes.*

*“Look, the takeaway is that the very nature of this place will come to aid you in your time of need so long as you keep that watch on hand.” I could tell Montey was getting a bit irritated. Though, I couldn’t tell if it was from all my questions or at his lack of answers.*

*“Alright, so how do we take the fight to The Guy Who Sings or whatever?”*

*“We? What do you mean we?” Montey asked, raising his hands and taking a step back.*

*“We. Like, as in us. Together.”*

*“Sorry kid, but all I can offer is guidance.”*

*“What do you mean guidance? You just controlled that fire! Can’t you use your fire powers to maybe burn him or something?”*

*“Okay, so I don’t control all the fire. Just the one inside this lantern. Which is actually the soul of this very golf course or at least the weird parts.”*

*“What?! Why don’t you put some water on that shit then and let's kill this damn place?!”*

*I could tell Montey was a bit taken aback by my suggestion. I could tell I had offended him, but I really didn’t understand why.*

*“Because that would only make things worse. Putting out this fire wouldn’t kill all these creatures. It would only make them go mad. The body without a soul would just become a writhing beast. I promise that's a lot worse than what we currently have to deal with.”*

*“Alright man, so how do I take the fight to him then? You know where he is?” I asked.*

*“Nahh, I don’t. Finding The One Who Sings isn’t going to be as easy as taking a left at the next tree. You should do some favors for the denizens around here. Ya know, like your job? Most of ‘em believe in an eye for an eye so I’d start with them.” Montey said.*

*“You want me to help these monsters out here?! These things are trying to fucking kill me!” I yelled.*

*This time Montey’s frustration was entirely visible. I could tell he was deeply hurt by my words. He shook his head at me and began walking away.*

*“Tell that to the Watchers who just helped save your ass. You won't last long with an attitude like that. In my opinion it seems like you don’t really deserve to.”*

*Montey’s words stung a bit more harshly than I expected. I could tell he felt like he was a part of this place just as much as anything else I saw around here. Maybe I was thinking about this all wrong. Maybe thinking that everything was out to get me was the wrong way to go about dealing with this situation.* 

*Montey’s light flickered and I could hear it crackle inside the lantern as he walked further into the woods. I turned around back in the direction that I came, but before I took a step, I looked up. I could see the bulbous eyes of the Watchers casting their gaze down on me. I took a deep breath and said in the most heartfelt tone I could muster.*

*“Thank you.”*

*All at once they blinked. I could hear the trees parting ahead making a clear path back to the golf course. I looked behind my back and I could see the lights of Montey’s lantern flare up, just for a second, before settling into the darkness once again.*

And that's the end of that entry. A bit short I know, but the guys got a lot going on. Him and I both… I think I’ll try and take a page out of his book, figuratively I mean. I should try and make myself known a bit more among the denizens, earn a few brownie points. Never know when I might need a bit of help myself.

Anyway, the suns coming up so I’ll fill you guys in on the next entry and whatever else happens to me on my next shift. Here's hoping it’s something good this time.
