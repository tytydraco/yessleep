This won’t make a lot of sense if you haven’t read my previous posts so here they are https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/L7saReF1JD and https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/TSE2bv2t7p but it might not make much sense if you’ve read them either, these sorts of things tend to boggle the mind. By the way, sorry to anyone who has been seeing men in suits after reading my last couple posts. Don't worry, you're not crazy. They are actually after you.


In my first post, I made a throwaway remark about how there “are no word police,” and that technically is true, but there certainly are entities of the federal government who will come after you if you talk about this stuff. How can I get away with it? Easy, nobody believes anything posted on Reddit. It’s psychically impossible for 93 percent of humans, my theory is that the site was cursed using ancient Tocharian blood magic. 


I bring up the feds now because they are somewhat important to this story, specifically the Department for the Containment of Dangerous Truths. If it sounds Orwellian it is, Orwellian, oppressive, unconstitutional, and necessary. There are things out there that we, by which I mean the collective masses of the human race, really don’t want a lot of people knowing about.
If let’s say, hypothetically, a town in Michigan starts worshiping something in a Fairy Pocket, something that will awaken from its dreaming death when the stars align,


Then the merciless eradication of the town and its people… is sometimes the merciful thing to do.


 That said, I’m not here to sing their praises; in fact, I don’t like them. They’re self-important black budget spooky glowie asshats, and they often make my life very hard. 


Such as the time I was on the 103rd floor of the Empire State Building being swarmed by demonic pigeons, and they threatened to fine me if I killed any of the fanged fire-breathing hellspawn. Apparently, they’re an endangered species. 


Or the time I watched them napalm a hippie commune in Nova Scotia for being in league with extra-dimensional forces… they were not.  Apparently the DCDT never learned that hippie losers on LSD talk about communing with nature goddesses that speak through Beatles songs all the time, and that is not, in fact, a sign they’re being puppeteered by the Great Old Ones. Unless their name is Charlie… then you might want to watch out. 


I’m sure you all are here for the story about the clowns, which I had previously said I wouldn’t tell. But on reflection, I think it’s necessary, don’t think this means you are ever gonna get Rockport, you don’t want to know about that town, you don’t need to know about that town, and you won’t learn about that town from me! But before we get to the clowns there are a few other small stories I figured I’d add in since I received feedback that my last post was too short, if that was all you thought about after reading my mall story… Are you okay?


So first let me tell you about the first time I ever had the pleasure of meeting agents of the DCDT. 


I was new to the job, only had it about a month at this point. Old Jed, the man who got me into this line of work, somewhere between a father and a worst enemy to me, had brought me along to survey a forest in Death Valley that appeared during certain phases of the moon. There was some evidence it might contain uranium deposits close to the surface that would be valuable to the right customer. So we spend days in Death Valley wearing radiation suits, trust me whatever is going on in your life. It. Could. Be. Worse. 


It didn’t by the way, the trees were just radioactive, but what it did contain was a small settlement inhabited by an inbred semi-feral tribe of mutants. I’d say the hills have eyes but these folks were mostly blind. However this story isn’t going where you probably expect, they were actually quite friendly. My first thought on seeing their misshapen forms lumbering through the trees was to shoot, but Jed stayed in my hand and quietly we approached. 


We observed them from a distance for a while. Jed was something of an amateur anthropologist where the various denizens of the Fairy Pockets were concerned, and would often write articles for Exploration Quarterly and the Esoteric Review. What you haven’t heard of them? Don’t think those are real publications? I guess you know every niche industry journal for obscure career paths then. 


He was like a kid in a candy store, taking notes and sketching them, I was hot. After a couple days, he finally had enough for a paper and we left the pocket, immediately he radioed our employer who called the feds to report what we’d found in accordance with federal law, we thought nothing more after that. Until we were about halfway back to where we parked our car when the black helicopter boys arrived. It was one of the Direct Response Containment Teams, in other words, DCDT’s SWAT. Though calling them a death squad might be more accurate.


They repelled down from their choppers all dressed in black and waving around guns that were about 50 years ahead of what the army had; I’ve always suspected some kind of multidimensional Iran Contra thing, but that’s one bear I chose not to poke. 


Once they were on the ground, pointing those futuristic-looking guns at us for no apparent reason, their leader, a man I chose to call Fluffy because it would probably annoy him, asked, demanded really that we show them back to the forest. But as a few days had passed and the moon wasn’t in position anymore we told him he was out of luck, it’d be a full year before anyone could get back in there again. 


He scowled and snapped his fingers at which point one of his goons pulled something like a crystal that seemed to glow darkness if that makes any sense, I can’t really describe it, from his pocket. Just being near it made my teeth hurt, and gave me the sense that something was watching me for days afterward. And wave it in the direction of where the forest had been. Sure enough, it rematerialized. Side note a tool that could force Fairy Pockets to appear would make my life so much easier, but something about that thing just screamed evil, and I’m glad I have never seen it again.  


We put back on our radiation suits and led them to the edge of the forest, despite our warnings about the dangerous radiation levels they insisted we lead them to the settlement and we relented. I mean, what do I care if they get cancer? If you tell a man about the dangers of smoking and he does it anyway that’s on him, right? Well, the same goes for walking into forests of radioactive trees as far as I’m concerned. 


I didn’t really know what was going on at the time but I could tell Jed was put out about the whole thing. He has a real begrudging attitude towards them the entire way back to the settlement. When we got there I realized why, they didn’t hesitate. Just raised their guns and started shooting, the entire population was wiped out in under seven minutes of mechanically precise violence. 


I was stunned, honestly, I was something stronger than stunned but I don’t think words exist for the feeling in English. These people had been freaks sure, but they weren’t hurting anyone, hell they couldn’t except for a few days out of the year even if they wanted to. 


And with hardly a word these monsters had massacred them. I tried to punch Fluffy then and there and was only saved from making that mistake by Jed grabbing my arm and pinning me against a tree. As soon as the deed was done they left and I turned to Jed demanding answers. He explained how things really work, why some awful things need to happen, and how we should just be glad we don’t have to do it. I didn't believe him at the time, thought he was just being a coward. Suffice it to say, I’ve seen enough since then, I’ve realized he was right. To put things in perspective their unofficial motto is “Great Cthulhu sleeps, we don’t” it really says it all. 


Jed will come up again from time to time in these stories, he plays a very important role in many of my early explorations. I miss that old bastard


Anyway, another interesting story for you is the time I was in Boston back about 10, maybe 15 years ago. That city is lousy with Fairy Pockets, I mean infested. Revolutionary battlefields hidden in Chinese restaurants, mad realms of jibbering flesh behind dumpsters, but most are fairly inoffensive by virtue of the fact that people only rarely fall in. Again every pocket has specific conditions which have to be met to get in and most people will never do the wrong thing in the wrong place at the wrong time in their life. 


This one was different, a large upscale department store was having a problem with retaining staff, and I don’t mean because they were quitting. They were vanishing into thin air at an alarming rate, well I guess anyone vanishing into thin air would be alarming to most people… but you get what I mean. 


So that’s why I got called in, and as it turned out they weren’t vanishing into thin air, rather they were vanishing into the janitor's closet next to the loading dock, which staff had been using for years as a place to sneak off and smoke. But as it became clear almost at once something had changed, because now they weren’t coming out. 


So I did the first thing that came to mind, I walked into the closet, sat on the upturned bucket, and lit one of Marlboro’s finest…. Nothing. Next, I tried wearing the employee uniform, trying other common brands of tobacco. All I got was a sore throat and a sore butt from sitting on that bucket. 


I started treating this like a murder mystery, looking into all the missing people and trying to find any connection between them, trying to build a profile. All one race? Nope. Same age range? Nah. What about religion? Nada! I was getting annoyed after a couple of days when I saw it. They were all hired on a Tuesday. I checked with the company, and sure enough, their HR department had always conducted interviews on Monday until a few months earlier when their old HR manager had retired and the new guy wanted to hold the meetings on Tuesdays.


Yeah turns out the way into that Pocket was to make 19 dollars and 73 cents an hour, be hired on a Tuesday, and smoke while sitting on a bucket within about half a square mile in downtown Boston. That’s not even the weirdest set of rules I’ve ever seen, but it gives a good picture of what I do to get into these places. Which I have somewhat neglected in my previous stories. As for the employees, they were dead, already absorbed by the flesh pillar. I got out as soon as I saw there was no saving them. 


Now for the thing I’ve been hinting at all day, the clown story. 


Where do I begin? I suppose background context is probably the best place. Chicago as I’m sure many of you know is not the safest city. But even in far more dangerous cities if the police were suddenly receiving reports of specific types of crime over 200 times more often they’d realize something was up. So it was when Chicago’s rate of missing children jumped from a handful of cases a week, to hundreds. The FBI took one look at the case and called in the DCDT, they spent several months and more taxpayer money than I care to guess at deciding that they couldn’t figure out what was going on and went home. Then the city government reached out to me. 


A gentleman doesn’t kiss and tell, neither does a professional get paid and tell but suffice to say I made enough to be happy for a while off the contract. So I started by going through all the paperwork the police had about the situation, it was a lot of dead trees for little result but I at least came away with the certainty that something weird was legit happening here. It took a couple months to figure out what was going on, and I won’t bore you with the details of my investigation, but it led me to “Boingo’s Bigtop Bonanza!” a fairy pocket that contained only one local inhabitant. Boingo the Clown. 


You see old Boingo, and old is right, best I could tell from the records, he had been coming out of his pocket to take kids every fifty years or so as long as Chicago had been a city. When I found out how to get in, I made a mistake. While I called the DCDT and told them to send a team, I decided to go in alone. Once I arrived in the pocket, there was a large gate in front of me shaped like a grinning clown's mouth, beyond it the grounds of a circus all lit up and popping calliope music but without a person in sight. On the clown's teeth were letters spelling out “NOW THE FUN STARTS”, I could tell right away fun would not be part of the equation. 


The air was humid and thick, stinking in a way you really can’t picture without having smelled it; it was like a mix of bad cologne and sugar, trying and failing to hide the stench of rotting meat. The piping music, and the flashing lights combined with the smell to make for an extremely disorientating effect, and as I crossed the grounds to the main tent, I felt as if I was walking without getting any closer, an illusion, I think, as I did eventually reach the tent. 


Standing outside the entrance to the tent, a new sound could be heard under the eerie calliope music piping around the thick air. The sounds of a children’s party, laughing, yelling, fragments of conversation, and the clicking sounds of people eating and drinking from plastic plates and cups. All with a manic energy that seemed somehow sad in its faux happiness. I didn’t go in, not by the front door; instead, I crept around until I found a back entrance, and after checking my surroundings, I slipped in. 


I want you to picture a medieval feast, now mix that mental image with a kid's birthday party, and that’s what I saw. Kids ranging in age from 5 to 12 sat at long tables laughing and talking and eating piles of cakes and candies, shoving them in with pure gluttony, all wearing wide fixed grins bellow blank eyes that all seemed to glow an almost luminescent green. 


And above them on a raised dais, sitting on a bright technicolor throne was the grossest fattest man I have ever seen, the folds of his gut hung from the sides of the throne like curtains and spilled out from under an overstretched polka dot shirt like a bag of worms. His skin wasn’t a natural white, but truly white as if it had been painted, which, in truth, I suppose it had, as he was a vast and vile clown. He watched over the partying children with calculating eyes as if he were looking for something. 


And to my horror, I soon learned what, as I watched, he raised a vast soft hand, and the tent fell silent with the eyes of all the children on their jester king. When he spoke, the high-pitched voice seemed muffled and wet as it escaped his wobbling lips. 


“Bring me Breydon.” Suddenly, the children exploded into movement as at least a dozen of them grabbed one of the older kids and wrestled him, screaming to the front of the room where the clown seemed to examine him with a keen eye. I recognized him; he was one of the first kids to go missing almost six months earlier. 


“Yes, he will do,” the clown spoke like a businessman approving absently of a wine before a meal meant to impress more than taste good. Then the other kids were forcing Braydon to his feet and into the clown's vast arms, with surprising strength, the clown lifted the boy, kicking and screaming now in terror, and sniffed at his hair. It didn’t take a genius to guess what came next, and I looked away as I heard the awful squelching and crunching noises. 

Slowly, I crept back out of the tent and decided to leave. There was nothing I could do, nothing except wait for the DCDT agents to come and deal with this. And come they did, bursting through the gates in full tactical regalia as I sat stunned and sickened by the giant mouth. I was not surprised to see it was Fluffy’s team, I had crossed paths with them semi-frequently, still do though Fluffy is either dead, promoted or retired as I havan’t seen him in years. Without a word, they brushed past me, then the shooting started… 


It went on for what felt like hours, though I know it was less than a minute. There was an initial roar of gunfire and screams, then a tremendous blast as something exploded, and the horrid smell grew worse, washing out from the tent. Soon, the sound was dying down to a few sporadic cries of pain. Cries that invariably would be followed by a single shot, then silence. As the DRCT men exited the big top, I saw their unadorned black armor was painted red with fresh blood. Not thinking of my own safety, I staggered up to Fluffy, cussing him out and demanding an explanation as to why they had killed all the children. His men were all pointing guns at me as I stood before him, shouting, but I didn’t care; I was outraged, infuriated. 


“Their eyes were green,” he said in a cold, distant voice. “They’d already eaten his food; they weren’t people, not anymore.” Then we signaled to one of his men, who pulled something from his pocket and pressed a button, and like that, they were gone, faded into thin air with a sound like tearing leather. The worst part is that I knew he was right, sup not of the faerie and those kids had done more than sup, they had feasted down to the dregs. Whatever humanity they’d once had was long gone before their eyes turned green, I knew that, but still it hurt. I have many issues with the DCDT, but one thing I can’t deny is that they do things I know need done, and know more than I could ever do call me a hypocrite, but at least I’m honest. 


Not having whatever tech they used, it was harder for me to leave, but eventually I found myself back in Chicago. I was paid well for my work and was given the keys to the city in secret, but I’ve never come closer to quitting my job than I did then. I did quit it, for all of two months, but as I’ve said before, I’m an addict, and try as I might…


I can’t quit
