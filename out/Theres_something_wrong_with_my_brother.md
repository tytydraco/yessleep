I think there's something wrong with my brother



My 18 year old brother, Millane, has been acting strange lately, he hugs me way more often than before. Ever since last week, I can't help but notice small changes about my brother, changes in his behavior specifically. He asks me to let him sleep in my room, sometimes in my bed. When I ask why, he just shrugs and wrap his arms around me. My brother has never been a very cuddly person, he always liked to stay alone. Due to personal reasons, I moved out of my parent's house as soon as I could, I felt a bit guilty about leaving Millane with them, knowing that they didn't really get along.



 A week ago, my brother had called me, asking if he could live with me, I knew something happened because Millane never really asked anyone for help, he was fragile, yes, but he always got through alone. Currently, he's living with me and I can't ignore the way he looks at me, the way those dark eyes look so empty when he smiles. Millane almost never leaves the apartment, when I come home from work, he's always sitting on the couch, in the exact same spot, always greeting me with that same flat voice and everytime he laughs it just doesn't feel... real. Yesterday, I woke up to my brother peeking through my door, when I confronted him about it, he pretended it never happened. He's been so clingy lately, whining when I go to work, as if he were still 12. 



Something strange about my brother is the way he nods, always in the same way, like a robot. When I'm ranting about a particularly annoying co-worker that has been harassing me, he just smiles eerily, eyes wide as he listens to my story. Sometimes, he'd come up to me when i'm making dinner, place a hand on my shoulder and say softly "I love you.", before going back to sitting straight on the couch. Speaking about dinner, he never seems to eat the snacks I bring back home. They disappear from the pantry, yes, but I've never seen him eat any of them.



My annoying co-worker has been missing from work, I haven't seen him yesterday, nor today, which was strange because as much of an asshole as he was, he always strictly attended work. Today I came home to Millane, standing behind the front door, like he's been here all day, he smiled and asked me a single question in that empty voice of his : "Did you have a good day today?"



I love my brother to death, I don't know if i'm just being paranoid but I know there's something wrong with him. I tried bringing him to a psychologist to find out what was wrong with him, but she said everything was normal, that he was healthy, that everything was okay and that I was imagining things. I haven't been sleeping well lately, how could I? Not when this *thing* is in the next room. I don't know what to do, I love my brother so much, I don't want to see it, I don't want to face the fact that...



There's something wrong with my brother.
