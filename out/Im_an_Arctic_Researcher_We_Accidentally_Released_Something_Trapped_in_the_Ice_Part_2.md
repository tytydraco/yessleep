**June 17, 2021**

We worked tirelessly to plug the leak, our frantic efforts having no effect. The gas, icy and ethereal, billowed up from the drill hole, swirling in the biting Arctic air. It continued to contaminate the atmosphere with a toxicity that turned the world around us into a distorted, deathly landscape.

Relocating as far away from the leak as possible was our only immediate solution. We set up a makeshift camp, using available equipment to shield ourselves from the invasive gas. Sheets of plastic, tarps, and tents were quickly assembled, offering a fragile, albeit temporary, refuge.

Inside the protection of our improvised shelter, we gathered around our portable heater. Lucas had sedated Erika, and she lay motionless, her breaths shallow and labored. Despite our exposure to the toxic fumes, no one else exhibited signs of illness, at least not yet.

"We have to return to the base. It's our only chance," Dr. Khan, our team leader, insisted, his normally calm demeanor cracked with anxiety.

There was a murmur of agreement. But a nagging thought at the back of my mind compelled me to speak up.

“There's a village nearby,” I said, my voice stronger than I expected. “They need to be warned about this. The wind is shifting in their direction.”

"How far is it?" Dr. Khan asked, his voice strained.

"It's not too far, about 12 miles," I reassured him.

“Noah… I don’t think that’s a good idea…” Dr. Khan started to say.

"I'll go then," I interjected. “I know the route, and the villagers know me. It'll be faster if I go alone."

“You mean walk there? By yourself?” Becca spoke up.

“I can cover the distance in a day,” I argued, my gaze meeting hers. There was a resolve in my voice that surprised even me.

"If you're going, then I'm going with you," she stated with a determination that left no room for debate.

“I’ll be fine. I don’t need a babysitter,” I countered.

Her blue eyes flashed with an icy intensity at the comment. "Are you being fucking serious?" she exploded. "This isn't a walk in the park! This is the Arctic! What if you get lost or injured, or the gas starts affecting you out there? No one should go alone, especially not now.”

I tried to respond, but she overrode me. “If you go by yourself, you’ll just end up dead from hypothermia before you even get a chance to warn the village. You want to help them? I’m your best shot.”

I knew she had a point, but I just couldn’t ask her to risk her life for me. I appealed to Dr. Khan to decide. “Dr. Khan, please…” I implored.

He regarded us for a moment before sighing and conceding, “Becca’s right. You’ll fare better together. Take a sled, maintain radio contact, and return to the base as soon as you can.”

With the decision made, there was no room for second thoughts. Becca and I hurriedly assembled our supplies and readied the sled. We tightly wrapped our faces in several layers of bandanas, moistened to help filter the air. We pulled on heavy-duty snow goggles to protect our eyes from the potentially harmful gas. We did our best to protect the huskies as well, securing their snouts with makeshift masks.

Our husky team was a lifeline in the unforgiving wilderness. Aspen, the fearless leader, blazed the trail ahead. Behind her, Willow and her twin brother Cedar, mirrored each other in perfect harmony, their connection beyond just their matching silver coats and ice-blue eyes. At the back, Pine, with his unyielding strength, acted as the powerful anchor.

As we started our journey, the wind whipped around us, carrying with it the biting chill of the air. The sleds cut through the snow effortlessly, the dogs pulling with an eagerness that defied the unforgiving conditions.

"Look, Noah," Becca started, her eyes trained on the horizon. "I want to apologize for what happened back there. I didn't mean to sound so... harsh."

I looked at her, surprised by the sincerity in her voice. "No, Becca. If anything, I should be thanking you," I admitted, giving her a small, grateful smile. "I'm glad to have a polar expert watching my back,” I added, knowing she'd appreciate the compliment.

Her cheeks flushed from beneath her protective gear. Whether it was from the cold or my compliment, I couldn't tell.

\----------As we ventured farther from our drill site, the landscape underwent subtle yet unmistakable changes. The sun, perpetually casting a sallow glow, illuminated the pristine snow with an eerie light. The snow no longer glistened; it had a matte, lifeless finish, as if its vitality had been drained.

The animals we encountered were behaving unusually too. A snow hare that hopped across our path moved sluggishly, its normally white fur tinged with a sickly bluish hue. An arctic fox, usually shy and elusive, showed no fear, no recognition of us as potential threats. It just stared at us with glassy eyes as we passed by, as if it didn't comprehend what it was seeing.

The most disconcerting change, however, was the silence. The Arctic is usually filled with sounds – the crunch of snow underfoot, the chattering of birds, the howl of the wind. But now, it was as if nature itself had fallen into a stunned, deathly silence. Even the wind seemed muted, whispering rather than wailing.

By the time we reached the village past midnight, the ever-present sun hovered overhead, bathing the icy mountains and vast Arctic ocean in an alien glow. The frigid air gnawed at our faces as we approached the village. Even from the outskirts, I could tell something was wrong—the chimneys of the colorful houses were smokeless.

The village, known as Silap Inua or 'the spirit of the universe,' was eerily quiet, a stark contrast to the vibrant community life we had witnessed just days before.

Navigating the snow-laden paths between homes, our breath formed small frosty clouds in the freezing air. We called out for any inhabitants, but our voices echoed back, swallowed by the desolate silence. Discarded remnants of everyday life littered our path—children's toys scattered in the snow, piles of half-chopped firewood next to silent homes, fishing nets abandoned by the river's edge.

We entered the largest house, that of the chief and his extended family. The door was ajar, with untouched meals on tables and clothing strewn haphazardly. Inside, we detected a faint, sickly-sweet odor, eerily reminiscent of the smell from the drilling site.

“Do you think it’s the gas?” Becca whispered, her eyes wide with fear.

“Must be,” I replied, grimacing as the smell hit me again. "But where did everyone go?”

"Maybe they evacuated?" Becca suggested, although she sounded unsure.

"I hope so," I said, examining a pot of soup that was still warm.

"It doesn't look like they had time to prepare. Everything's just... left," Becca noted, picking up a doll made of walrus ivory.

"We need to look for signs," I suggested. "They might have left a message saying where they went.”

Becca and I systematically searched each house. We reached Katak’s house late in the afternoon. The elderly shaman lived alone in a quaint dwelling at the village outskirts. I had interviewed him only days earlier.

As I pushed open the door, the creaking sound echoed ominously. We entered the dimly lit room, the weak sunlight from the window illuminating the dust particles suspended in the air. Everything was just as I remembered - the walls adorned with tribal masks, the aged wooden floor lined with fur rugs, and the hearth at the center, now cold and lifeless.

My gaze was drawn to a corner of the room, where a message was hastily etched onto the wall. The text was in the native Inuit syllabary, the normally round characters were inconsistent as if scrawled in haste. A black-tinted blade, similar to the one I saw in the cave, lay on the floor next to the message.Becca walked up behind me. "What does it say?"

My heart pounded in my chest as I translated the text. "It... It says 'Beware the spirit of the ice. The Ijiraq have returned...’ and then it just...cuts off."

"What's an Ijiraq?" Becca asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

I paused, unsure of how much to reveal. "They’re spirits from Inuit folklore. They’re said to be shape-shifters, creatures that exist in the realm between the living and the dead. They’re like Inuit boogeymen. My grandma used to tell me that if I didn’t behave, an Ijiraq would get me in my sleep."

“Yeah, but that’s just a story, right?” Becca asked incredulously. Like an attempt to explain natural occurrences.”

A tense silence filled the room. There was more to the myth, but I didn’t see any point in scaring her with ghost stories. “Katak was always a little... eccentric,” I said dismissively. “He believed in a lot of weird stuff, like saying he could communicate with foxes, and that they would give him messages from the spirit world. I would take everything he says with a grain of salt.”

A sudden harsh gust of wind rattled the window panes, causing us to exchange a glance of concern. We ran to the window. The first thing I noticed was how dark things had gotten. With the ever-present midnight sun, this should have been impossible.

Outside, the sky darkened ominously, the yellow-green hue swallowed by a mass of angry gray clouds. I had goosebumps as the first snowflake landed on the window. The weather forecast hadn’t predicted a storm, but there was definitely one brewing.

"Storm's coming," Becca said, her eyes wide as she looked out the window. "A big one."

I could feel the air around us getting colder. "We need to find shelter," I said, scanning for a good place to hunker down. The gas hadn’t affected us yet, and we’d be exposed to more of it if we tried to trudge through the storm, with its own inherent dangers.

Spotting a large communal building on a hill towards the center of the village, I gestured towards it. "There, that house. It's higher off the ground, we should be safer from the gas there."

We gathered the huskies and hurried towards the house, the dogs rushing in ahead of us. The wind howled in our ears, biting through our winter gear as we struggled against the rising storm.

Once inside the house, we worked quickly to secure the entrances, sealing the doors and windows with whatever materials we had on hand to minimize the gas exposure. The dogs were restless, pacing anxiously around the room. Their unease mirrored my own.

Becca grabbed the radio, her hands shaking slightly as she adjusted the frequency and relayed our situation back to Outpost Aurora. “Dr. Andersson, we’re trapped in the village by the storm. We’re going to try to wait it out. We’re as sealed up as we’re going to get against the gas. Over.”

There was a pause, then her voice crackled through, sounding tense. “Understood. Stay safe. We’ll maintain radio contact. Over and out.”

**June 18, 2021**

Becca and I rationed out our meager food supply - cans of stew, chunks of hard bread, and energy bars that tasted like cardboard, but had the necessary calories. We melted snow for drinking water, being careful to heat it just enough to kill off any bacteria. Yet, we weren't sure if this method was effective in removing gas. The dogs, our faithful companions, were fed with dry kibble and chunks of frozen fish we had packed.

As the wind outside roared and battered the structure of the house, we huddled close together around a portable heater for warmth. Even with our winter gear on, the biting cold was almost unbearable. The dogs lay in a pile, their bodies a source of warmth in the otherwise freezing room.

Unable to sleep, my mind was restless, filled with the day's chaotic events. I could still picture Erika, her body convulsing as the toxic gas took hold. The image filled me with a dread I could hardly put into words. How long before we too would begin to show symptoms?

Ever so often, I found myself glancing over at Becca, scrutinizing her face for any signs of illness.

I sat up and pulled out the knife I had taken from Katak’s home, examining it under the faint light in the room. The black tinted blade was forged meteorite iron, the same as the one we found at the drilling site. The handle was made of narwhal tusk, intricately carved with ancient Inuit symbols. As I traced them with my fingers, memories of the legends about the Ijiraq swirled in my mind.

These weren’t just children’s tales. The Inuit people respected and feared these spirits. While I respected the myths and legends, I was still a man of science, grounded in reality and observable facts. Yet to dismiss these tales as mere superstition seemed almost... disrespectful.

Exhaling slowly, I glanced once more at Becca. Her breaths were steady and slow, a stark contrast to the raging storm outside. A wave of relief washed over me. She was fine, at least for now.

Carefully, I put the blade back into my pocket and tried to settle back into my sleeping bag.

I don't recall when I fell asleep, but the dream was vivid. I was a child again, back in the tiny, cramped apartment in Anchorage's Mountain View neighborhood that I shared with my mom and grandma.

The faint smell of my mom's cooking clung to the worn-out furniture. I could hear the muffled sound of sirens and angry voices from the street below, a soundtrack to my childhood.

I was bundled under the patchwork quilt my grandma made, trying to stay awake until my mom got home from her two jobs. My eyelids were heavy, sleep was creeping in, but I fought against it. I wanted to catch a glimpse of my mom, to reassure myself that she had made it back safely.

Beside me, my grandmother sat in her favorite rocking chair, the rhythmic creaking a soothing counterpoint. Her voice was soft yet firm as she wove intricate stories of ancient Inuit legends, her wrinkled hands gesturing dramatically, enhancing the narrative.

Suddenly, a loud banging noise echoed through the small apartment. Fear gripped me as she looked at me, her eyes filled with a mixture of terror and determination.

"Noah, you're in danger. You need to leave, now," she said, her voice filled with urgency. She hurriedly pulled a parka over my small frame, her movements quick and precise.

The banging grew louder, the whole apartment shaking with the sheer force of it. I recognized the noise instantly - the sound of my father's rage. The door burst open, splintering into pieces as a drunken figure staggered into the room. My heart pounded in my chest as I watched my father's slurred movements, his eyes scanning the room.

Ignoring him, my grandmother ushered me towards the window that opened onto the fire escape.

"Go to Mrs. Olsen's place, and I’ll come get you later," she instructed, her voice just a whisper now, but her words held the weight of an ultimatum.

"But, grandma," I started, but she cut me off.

"No buts, Noah. Go!"

I was just about to climb out of the window when I glanced back one last time, my heart aching at the sight of my grandmother, her frail form standing tall and defiant against my drunken father.

“Where is he, Anuri? Where's my son?" he slurred, his gaze wild.

“You’re drunk, Hank,” grandma said. “Sober up and then maybe we’ll talk.”

“He’s my son!” my dad shouted. “You can’t keep him from me!”

I heard a scuffle ensuing. “Get out of my way!” my dad screamed.

As the cold air hit my face, my dream began to unravel, the harsh reality of my past merging into the grim predicament of my present. I was jolted awake, my heart pounding, the sound growling and barking.

I shot up from my sleeping bag. Becca was already awake and trying to calm the dogs.

“Hey, guys, what’s wrong?” she asked, checking on each one.

“What’s the matter?” I asked groggily.

“I don’t know. Something must have spooked them,” she responded.

Becca reached for the radio, pressing the button and calling through the static. "Drill team, this is Becca and Noah, do you copy?"

Only the hum of the storm responded to our call.

"Dr. Khan, are you there? Please respond." Her voice wavered slightly, a hint of fear creeping into her normally confident tone.

Still, there was no answer. The silence seemed to amplify the harsh howling of the wind outside, the sound seeming to seep into the very walls of the house.

With a worried expression, she put down the radio. "We need to try again in a bit. The storm might be affecting the signal."

The dogs were growing more restless by the minute, their whimpers growing into anxious barks. They were fixated at something just outside the front door. Sensing their distress, I got up and peered through the tiny crack in the door.

Among the swirling gusts of snow, I saw unsettling figures moving. Their forms were hauntingly unfamiliar, a blend of the grotesque and beautiful. Some had elongated limbs and disproportionate body parts, their shapes hardly human. Others were adorned with animal characteristics – antlers that cut through the gale, feathers that fluttered in the blizzard, scales that shimmered in the harsh arctic lights, or fur that rippled as if in a breeze.

"Becca," I whispered, my throat dry. "You need to see this."

I didn’t get a response.

“Becca, did you hear me?” I whispered a little louder.

A blood-curdling scream tore through the night. Becca. My heart lurched in my chest as I turned. One of the creatures was crawling on the ceiling and walls of the cabin. Its elongated limbs ending in claws scraped against the wood, creating the sound of nails on chalkboard. Its body was like smoke, twisting and changing, never settling on a single form.

Without warning, the being slid down from the walls, making no noise as it landed. Its form was ghostly, constantly shifting in the light of our lantern. One moment it resembled an Inuit woman with straight black hair, the next a polar bear with gleaming fangs. It shimmered as if formed from ice and snow, a mirage born of the Arctic itself. Its eyes, the only constant in its ever-changing form, two jet-black sockets, empty and soulless, stared at us.

Becca just stood there, stunned. I grabbed her hand and pulled her close. “Get behind me,” I whispered.

The thing's mouth opened wide, emitting a guttural sound that sent a shiver down my spine. It started mimicking Dr. Khan's voice perfectly, "I don't understand what's happening. It's the gas... we're changing."

Erika's voice followed, panicked and gasping for breath, "I can feel it inside me... it's... it's... burning!" The shrieks of pain and terror were lifelike, making it all the more chilling.

Next came the voices of the others on the team, their pleas for help, their cries of agony echoing in the otherwise silent room.

The entity's body contorted and twisted, as if in a grotesque imitation of their final, torturous moments. It was as if the very air around us carried the terror of those last moments.

The last voice we heard was Dr. Khan’s. “Please help us…”

The creature looked at us, its eyes vacant and unblinking. Then, it tilted its head and began to laugh, a terrible, echoing sound that filled the room. Its laughter was like nothing I'd ever heard, a horrifying imitation of human joy.
