To the people helping me keep going, I’ll answer a few questions. The reason I live in New York is that I used to live somewhere else—where, I’d rather not say. But after what happened to my father… and what happened to me… I had to move.
 
If I’m being honest, I was scared. Scared my mother would take me out the way she did any other monster. That wouldn’t have been unexpected for a Hemmings. Hatred runs deep in our bloodline—old, deliberate, inherited. We were raised to believe monsters didn’t deserve mercy.
 
And maybe that’s what still scares me most—because now, when I look in the mirror, I see the kind of thing we were trained to kill. I’ve lived quietly for years now. But that night, I met the thing that made me.
 
As for why I don’t just lock myself up in a silver cage—well, I’m living on a teacher’s paycheck. Silver’s not cheap, and I eat more than most people because of my… second job. Even if I could afford it, getting silver is nearly impossible these days. Most of my family buys it in bulk, stockpiling it like they’re waiting for another purge.
 
Sometimes I think about how ironic that is—hunters hoarding the one thing that could kill them if they ever turned. But irony doesn’t stop bullets or claws.
 
That night, I was at Annabelle and August’s house, sitting in the living room, trying to teach Annabelle about history—and more importantly, how to act around humans.
 
She was sharp. Too sharp. Every question I asked, she answered before I could finish. I’ve taught kids for years, but none of them ever looked at me like that—eyes too still, too knowing.
 
It made sense, though. Shifters evolved to mimic what they hunted. Intelligence was survival.
 
After a while, August came in and set down a plate of chicken nuggets for Annabelle. The smell of oil and salt filled the air. I smiled automatically, but it didn’t reach my eyes. My chest tightened. Last night’s memories pressed like cold fingers against the back of my mind. The wolf didn’t like small spaces—or being around prey.
 
“That’s a pretty simple meal,” I said after a moment. My voice came out rough, uneven. “Not trying to be rude, but… do monsters eat anything specific?”
 
The word *monsters* hung too long in the air.
 
August shot me a look—flat, unreadable, but not cruel. “For some, yes,” she said. “There are foods we can’t eat, and some we prefer. But most of us have flexible diets. Like humans.” She hesitated, her voice dropping. “Some eat… humans. But we don’t promote it.”
 
The air thickened. My pulse jumped. Beneath the table, my fingers twitched—reaching for a weapon that wasn’t there. I could feel it stirring inside me, that restless scratching behind my ribs. The wolf always woke at the scent of threat or guilt.
 
“I’m sorry if that came off wrong,” I said quickly. “It’s just… all I know is what’s written in the Hemmings records.”
 
August’s face softened. “I know those books,” she murmured. “Some of them… weren’t kind.”
 
Silence followed. Heavy.
 
Annabelle broke it, cheerful and oblivious. “It would be really nice to read something from Mr. Jack’s family, Mom! He seems like a very nice hunter!”
 
Her voice was too innocent for the weight in the room. I managed a small smile and patted her head, though it felt like touching glass.
 
Both August and I said, almost in unison, “It’s probably best if you don’t read that.”
 
We froze. Then August smiled—small, tired, and real. I smiled back, or tried to.
 
When I stood, the room felt smaller. Heavy. I gave Annabelle one last pat and nodded to August before stepping outside.
 
Cool air met me—pine, rain, the promise of a storm. The quiet should have been peaceful. Instead, it made the noise inside my head louder.
 
The lighter clicked. Smoke curled around my face, bitter and grounding. Cigarettes were bad for me, sure—but they muffled the wolf’s breathing for a few minutes.
 
I drove aimlessly. The road blurred into streaks of gray and fog. My reflection in the windshield looked like someone I used to know—eyes hollow, skin drawn thin. I’d seen that look before. On corpses.
 
Eventually, I found myself outside a bar on the edge of town—**The Hollow Tap.** The neon sign sputtered in the drizzle, half the letters dead.
 
Inside, it smelled of wet wood, spilled beer, and something older—soil after rain, maybe decay. Beneath the laughter and music, I could feel it. That low, familiar pulse of instinct. There were monsters here. All pretending to be human.
 
I took a seat. The stool creaked beneath me. “Vodka,” I said. My throat felt like sandpaper.
 
The bartender poured it—broad-shouldered, skin with a faint green sheen that caught the light when he moved. A frog shifter.
 
His grin faded into something like reverence. “Don’t see many wolves around anymore,” he said quietly. “Most of your kind moved north after the last purge.”
 
I took a sip. “Yeah. Something like that.”
 
He leaned closer. “You ever hear of the **Moon Eater**?”
 
The name hit me like ice water down my spine. “I've heard some, but not too much."
 
He chuckled softly, throat pulsing. “She’s the one who started your line. The first wolf. Some call her the Pale Matron, others the Winter Mother. They say she wasn’t born of the world—she *made* it bleed. Came crawling out of the ice before language, when the sky was still too new to hold stars. Her fur was white as breath on glass, her eyes burning like coals in snow. When the moon rose full, she swallowed it whole to keep it from falling into the sea.”
 
He wiped a glass as he spoke, voice low and reverent. “They say that light burned inside her—too bright, too alive. It twisted her bones. Made her hunger for warmth, for voices, for hearts that beat. When she couldn’t hold the moon anymore, she tore open her belly and let the light spill out. The wolves were born from what was left.”
 
He hesitated. “Some say she wasn’t just a monster. She was something older—one of the first predators to crawl out of chaos, when gods still had to feed to exist. The shapeshifters, the hunters, even the witches—they all trace their bloodlines back to her kind. The ones that *ate creation* to make room for themselves.”
 
His voice dropped to a whisper. “Some say she still walks when the night’s too bright—still hungry. Still looking for what she lost.”
 
His hands trembled as he set the glass down.
 
For a moment, the room felt colder. The lights dimmed—or maybe my eyes just adjusted wrong. The air shifted, like the story itself had taken something from us.
 
Then the door opened.
 
She stood there.
 
Tall. Broad-shouldered, but graceful. Her hair, the color of storm clouds, streaked with silver. Skin pale like snow under ice. Eyes gold—not human gold, but molten, alive. Her clothes were simple, but the shadows clung to her like they knew her name.
 
And behind her, in the bar mirror, something vast and pale moved—a wolf’s shape half-formed from mist.
 
“You smell like my children,” she said. Her voice was smooth, quiet, and ancient. “But not quite the same. You weren’t born of the Moonlight.”
 
The words froze me.
 
She smiled—softly, almost tender. “And yet you carry it well. Strong. Steady. You’ve learned to listen to what most of them never could.”
 
Her hand brushed my cheek—cool, dry. For a second, I smelled winter: pine sap, cold stone, and iron in snow. My pulse stuttered. The wolf inside me bowed, wordless and small.
 
“You’ve done what few of my blood ever manage,” she murmured. “You live in both worlds without drowning in either. I’m proud of you, Jack Hemmings.”
 
My name in her mouth sounded older than I’d ever heard it.
 
Before I could speak, she laughed—soft, almost human. The sound filled the bar like wind through pine.
 
“I was proud once, too,” she said. “Until I learned the world doesn’t love its creators—it only fears them.”
 
I blinked, and for an instant her outline fractured—light spilling from her ribs.
 
Then she was gone.
 
The door stood open, and outside, the night looked just a little too bright. The clouds had thinned, and the moon hung pale and ragged—its edges missing, like something had taken more than one bite.
 
I stood there, smoke still burning in my lungs, and for a moment I couldn’t tell if I’d just met her… or remembered her.
