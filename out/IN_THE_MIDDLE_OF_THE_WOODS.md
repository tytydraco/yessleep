It’s been an exhausting week so I decided to take a break. I packed my things, a backpack with some clothes, and other necessities because I’m going to a remote place in the middle of the woods. Of course, I didn’t forget to include my shotgun: Remington 870, and my buddy Morris, a goofy German Shepherd.  
  
I locked all the doors and windows of my apartment and headed to my truck, with Morris already relaxing at the back. I opened the door at the passenger’s seat and told him to come.  
  
I drove for about 2 hours, one hand on the steering wheel and the other holding a sandwich I haphazardly made before leaving. The road I took is so deserted. No cars, no houses, or any establishments whatsoever. It’s kinda creepy, it was like I was the only man left on earth. When we were almost at our destination, it was creepier because the only things you could see are trees, and the only sounds you could hear are, well, from whatever creatures are out there. The constant whining of Morris didn’t help either. It was like he doesn’t even want to be there.  
  
It was after lunch when I arrived. I marveled at the small but cozy cabin. I went inside and thought that I scored a good deal. It’s a really good place to unwind relatively to its cheap price. It has a bedroom, a small kitchen, and bathroom. The living room is also cool with big windows where you can see the woods. I put my things inside and Morris began sniffing around the place with his tail tucked between his legs. It’s really unusual as he’s a really brave dog, much more than bigger dogs, and it’s actually the first time I saw him being this scared.  
  
I brushed off his unusual behavior and started to scan the place. I went outside to see the exterior of the cabin and something caught my eyes-- scratch marks on the door. You know, I will just laugh it off if what I saw were only ordinary marks, but the scratches are fucking long. Like Freddy Krueger visited the place some time ago and tried to get in. I traced it with my fingers, it’s not only long, but deep as well. Was it a bear? I nervously thought.  
  
If there are bears in this area, I better be prepared and make sure that Morris will not be able to wander that far because it’s dangerous if he comes across the bear who made these marks. I noted that in mind and continued to examine the place. I can also make a bonfire with the tree branches laying around, it will be nice to have some smoked sausage paired with a can of cold beer while looking at the stars. I chuckled with that corny thought.   
  
I decided to get back inside when I noticed something, just a little away from the doorstep, I saw tiny dark marks. My eyes followed it to see that the tiny marks became longer and were all over the place. It was like something, or *someone* were dragged here and the dark marks were blood. I shivered.  
  
*What the fuck happened here?! Did someone get killed?*
