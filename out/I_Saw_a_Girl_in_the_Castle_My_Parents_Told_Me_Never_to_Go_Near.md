I grew up in a small town where nothing ever happens. No shopping malls. No tech hubs. Just winding roads, quiet neighbors, and a medieval-looking castle standing like a forgotten relic on the far edge of town. My parents always told me to stay away from it.

“It’s dangerous,”  
“It’s rotting inside,”  
“It’s full of stories that aren’t just stories.”

Honestly, I never really cared. I was 18, bored, and busy wasting time scrolling and flirting with random girls online. The castle was just a background piece to my life.

Until it wasn’t.

It was around 5:30 PM when I saw her.

The sky was turning orange, and I was biking past the gravel path that curved near the old castle grounds. Out of instinct, I glanced toward the structure—just like I always did. But this time, someone was standing on the balcony.

A girl.

She looked around my age. Long black hair, flowing like ink in the wind. Pale skin that glowed under the dying light. And even from that distance, I swear—she was smiling at me.

I slowed my bike, stunned. Who the hell even lives there?

She didn’t wave. She just turned slowly and walked inside, her white dress trailing behind like fog.

Now, I’m not gonna lie—I’m a bit of a flirt, and I’d never seen her around town. Maybe she was visiting? Maybe her family bought the place? I was curious, sure. But it wasn’t just curiosity. Something about her... pulled me in.

The next day, I went back.

I didn’t tell my parents. Obviously.

I just said I was going out to meet some friends, grabbed my phone and flashlight, and biked back to the castle as the sun started setting.

I climbed through a broken section of the fence and stood at the base of the stone walls. From up close, the place looked like it was held together by regret and ivy. The windows were shattered. The balcony—where I saw her—was dark.

Still, I called out.

“Hey! You there? I saw you yesterday!”

Nothing.

But I heard something else.

Footsteps. Bare, soft ones. On the wooden floor above.

I took that as an invite.

The inside of the castle smelled like wet stone and old rot. Dust clung to my breath, and the wooden stairs creaked like they remembered every foot that had walked them.

Then I saw her.

She was standing at the end of the corridor, just past the light leaking from the balcony doors.

Same white dress. Same black hair.

“Hi,” I said, smiling. “I’m—uh—just passing by.”

She smiled back.

And then, without saying a word, she walked through the closed door behind her.

I mean through it. Like it wasn’t there.

I ran.

Not just out of the castle—I didn’t stop pedaling until I was back home, my lungs burning, my throat raw. I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t.

But I went back again. Why? I still can’t answer that.

The dreams started the night after. Her face at the foot of my bed. Her smile in the mirror behind me. I stopped eating. My parents started worrying. I told them I had a cold.

One night, I dreamed of her whispering something. Her voice was hollow, like wind through a pipe. I woke up with mud on my feet. My bedroom door was locked from the inside.

The last time I saw her was last week.

I was sitting in my room when I heard someone whisper my name.

From under my bed.

I’ve tried burning sage. I’ve tried deleting the photos I took that day. (They’re back every morning.) My parents still think I’m just tired from "exam stress."

But I can’t tell them what really happened.

I can’t tell them that the stories were true.

And I can’t tell them that she’s still here, sometimes just inches from me in the dark.

She followed me back. I think she’s in love.

And now, I can't leave.
