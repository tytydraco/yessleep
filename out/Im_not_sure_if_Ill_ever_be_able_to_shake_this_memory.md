It's been haunting me for years, and I still can't wrap my head around what happened. I don't know what I saw or what I experienced, but it was something I'll never forget.

It all started when I was hiking in the woods by myself. I was an avid hiker and loved being in nature, so I was always up for a challenge. I had been to the woods several times before, and I was always fascinated by the beauty and peacefulness of the area. But this time, things took a turn for the worst.

As I was walking, I heard a strange noise coming from the bushes. I thought it was just an animal, so I continued on my path. But the noise only got louder, and soon I saw something moving in the bushes. I was scared, but I was also curious, so I approached the bushes to see what was there.

That's when I saw her. She was a woman, but not like any woman I've ever seen before. Her skin was pale, her eyes were black, and her hair was tangled and matted. She was wearing a long, tattered dress and she was just standing there, staring at me.

I didn't know what to do. I was frozen with fear, and I couldn't move. That's when she started to move towards me. She was walking slowly, but she was getting closer and closer. I was so scared that I just turned and ran as fast as I could. I ran and ran until I finally found my way out of the woods.

I never went back to that place again, but I can't forget what I saw. I don't know what that woman was, but I know she was something evil. Something I never want to see again.

Over the years, I tried to shake the memory of that woman and what happened in the woods. I tried to tell myself that it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but deep down I knew that wasn't the case. I knew what I saw was real, and I knew that woman was not human.

I started to research and try to find out more about what I saw in the woods. I read books on folklore and legends, and I even went to a psychic to see if she could help me understand what happened. But no one had any answers for me.

It wasn't until I met a man who had a similar experience that I finally got some answers. He told me about a local legend of a woman who was said to haunt the woods. The legend said that she was once a beautiful woman who lived in the area, but she was betrayed by the man she loved and left to die in the woods. It was said that her ghost still haunts the area to this day, seeking revenge on anyone who enters the woods.

I finally understood what I saw in the woods. I had encountered the ghost of the woman in the legend. And even though I knew what she was, the memory of that encounter still haunts me to this day.

Sometimes, when I'm lying in bed at night, I can still hear that strange noise. And sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can see her pale face and those black eyes. I know she's still out there, waiting for me to come back. And I know that I'll never be able to shake this memory.

I still love hiking and being in nature, but I never go back to that place in the woods. I don't know what I would do if I ever saw that woman again. All I know is that I never want to experience
