It all started five months ago when I bought that painting. I bought a new house because I had found a new job that paid better for less hours. The house, a two-story farmhouse, had tons of space that got filled by my beloved objects i had brought. However, there was still space that needed to be filled. So, I decided to drop by the local Goodwill and find items that would fit my house.

The parking lot was not full as usual, probably because it was ten in the morning, but I decided to head on in. I found some pretty neat items, including a vase, chair, couch pillows, a mat, a welcome sign, pots, pans, and a painting. The painting was not one of those random paintings someone usually gives to Goodwill. It was a portrait of a random person, a man of sorts. I, however, needed space to fill, so I made a last-second purchase on it.

After I hauled everything in, I decided to put up the painting in the hallway. It would at least serve some purpose. I guess I could look at it when I'm going from the hallway to the kitchen. Once I was glad where it was, I got the rest of the stuff I bought and put them where they were to be. When I finished with that, I hauled in the rest of my furniture and cookware.

It took me another few hours to get the rest of the furniture sorted, especially the second floor. It was a difficult task to do by myself, since I didn't have any friends close by. However, I managed. The upstairs seemed a bit smaller than downstairs. It was strange, but the rooms would be perfect for guests and other things of the sort.

It was about supper time, so I decided to treat myself to one of those cardboard pizzas that are cheap, but still taste fine. I got an uneasy feeling about the portrait. Maybe I put in the wrong spot. It felt like it was staring at me, even though I was in a different room entirely. It was probably because it was dark out.

Once I finished my supper, I decided to head off to bed. My bedroom had a bathroom connected to it, with the hallway being right outside of the door. I woke up at about one or two in the morning, thirsty for a glass of water. However, I walked by the painting as fast as I could. It seemed a bit childish, but it just seemed a bit creepy.

I went back to bed with a glass of water, and I went to sleep. I woke up the next morning and decided to not think about the events of the previous night. However, it just seemed as if it stared into your soul. I just let it slip from my mind and I decided to do other things to get the house looking ideal for me. I then decided to take a break and go for a walk.

It was a short, causal walk around the block, but it was fine. I reentered the house and decided to do more work upstairs. However, I found that the couch that I put upstairs, the one that was supposed to be used for a gaming room, was sat on. The couch pillows were not placed correctly, and the cushions were coming out a bit. I must have just decided to leave the couch like that when I put it there.

Again, it was time to rest, so I headed off to bed. Tomorrow was the first day of work. I tried clearing my head, and I decided it was finally time    to go to sleep. It, again, was one in the morning, and I got up to get a drink of water. Instead of feeling that the painting was staring into my soul, I felt like it was watching me. I again, got my drink of water and tried to pass it off again.

It was finally the first day of work. It wasn't terrible, but it could have been better. I met some of my coworkers, and I became friends with a few of them, but it was nothing major. It was time for supper. I ate, then headed to bed again.

It seemed like the past few nights were the same. I decided to just sleep, and if I wanted a drink of water, I could wait until morning. I again woke up at one in the morning to hear sounds of thumping  and shuffling from upstairs. I called the cops, and they inspected the house, but managed to find nothing. The sounds stopped after the cops stopped by and left.

It was finally morning. Another day of work. I told my coworkers about the strange occurrence I had last night. They did not believe me. "That's the most bullshit I've ever heard! Really? The last time we had one of those stories was from a guy that thought we were living through a cyborg attack!" one of them said. 

I returned home from work and decided to not think about it. Maybe some rodent lived in my house. It was getting on my nerves. Waking up at the same time of night that a rodent was up and about? It seemed impossible.

I decided to head to the living room through the hallway, and I spotted the painting again. I don't know why I kept it up. I told myself that I would get to it later. I watched some television with the time I had remaining, and I again went through the same repetitive cycle. It was really starting to get to me.

I again, tried sleeping, but again woke up at one on the morning. I was pissed and decided to do some investigating. I went upstairs and found nothing. Was there really just a rodent fucking with me? I decided to get a glass of water and head back to bed.

It was finally morning. The same repetitive cycle has kept happening. I keep waking up at one in the morning, the painting still creeps the living hell out of me, I pass it by. I need to take that painting down. I still have a job to do, however. Work did not like me today. I was tired and wanted to be out of there. 

I finally got home and I walked through the hallway, about to take down the painting until I heard a knock at the door. I opened the door to find a salesman at the door. He was offering a vacuum. I, however, turned his offer down and told him I wasn't interested. I then decided to take the painting down. It was creeping me out.

I decided to go to sleep again, and I woke up at two in the morning. My vision was blurry. Why did I keep waking up so early? I was pissed, but i heard footsteps from upstairs. I decided that this was my opportunity to catch whatever the hell was up there.

I walked through the hallway to get upstairs. I felt like someone, something was watching me. Nothing felt right. Every step, my heart beated faster and faster. I finally made it all the way up there and found nothing. Why does this thing keep fucking with me?

I made my way downstairs, and back to bed. I made it to work again the next day and was tired. Another long day completed. It was time for supper. It still felt like something was watching me. 

I called the cops again. They searched the place over heavily. I told them about what I kept hearing. They just kept telling me that they couldn't find anything. I was tired of this. Tired of the same things happening.

I decided that I would leave tomorrow. I, however, awoke at one in the morning. *Knock, knock, knock*. It was at my bedroom door. I was out of that place. I was not having this anymore. I was freaked the fuck out and I left immediately. I drove out of there as fast as possible and found a  motel out of town I could stay at.

I woke up the next morning and headed to work. I finally felt like I could do my job. When I got back to the motel, everything felt off. The walls looked the same as the place I just escaped. The floor, the exact same. The ceiling, the kitchen, the living  room, the television, all the same.

I left, feeling I couldn't escape the place I wanted to leave. I drove to a new town. I wanted to go as far as I possibly could to escape that place. I wanted to find a place I could live without feeling watched.

I found a new town and new property. I contacted the realtor who was selling the house. They seemed nice and friendly. I decided to get all my things together and move. I moved because the house seemed nice and there were new job opportunities.

I bought a new house because I had found a new job that paid better for less hours. The house, a two-story farmhouse, had tons of space that got filled by my beloved objects i had brought. However, there was still space that needed to be filled. So, I decided to drop by the local Goodwill and find items that would fit my house.

The parking lot was not full as usual, probably because it was ten in the morning, but I decided to head on in. I found some pretty neat items, including a vase, chair, couch pillows, a mat, a welcome sign, pots, pans, and a painting. Why is purgatory a living hell?
