I'm here to set the record straight. 


Everything you think you saw on that show is a lie. I gave Solo Survivor everything I had- every ounce of strength and sanity- and they showed none of it. I was being hunted- and they edited the footage to make it look like I was paranoid. What you see in the final edit is completely manufactured. Trust me: what I saw was not a fucking bear.

The helicopter dropped me off on a flat field. There were dense pine trees in every direction. From the flight in, I knew there was a river to the east, so I headed downhill. I didn’t plan on wasting time searching for the best spot. I wanted to build a shelter that I felt safe in. Food could wait.


I set up camp in a quiet spot. Nothing fancy, just a small wickiup, a campfire, and a log to sit on. River-water bubbled away in my pot. I had multiple camera angles of my camp, as per the rules. It took most of the day, but I felt confident about my start. 


Night was the issue- I couldn’t sleep. Every sound, every rustle of wind or distant crack, made me imagine a bear prowling nearby. Wolves howled. Twigs snapped. And the footsteps grew louder- quick, zigzagging footsteps from tree to tree. My shelter didn’t have a door yet, so when I looked towards my feet I could see the open night. I grabbed my hand-held camera (with its attached light) and aimed it outside.


You know how your mind plays tricks on you in the dark? Like when the coat hanging off your door looks like a man standing in the corner of your room, or if you can’t quite tell if your closest door is open? I could have sworn I was seeing a face. About 50 yards away, I could see what looked like a head tilted up towards the sky with its mouth wide open. I switched off the camera light. I don’t know what I saw, but I didn’t want to draw attention to myself.


When this season of the show aired, they replaced the footsteps with growling, and instead of the face I saw they cut to a night vision shot of a bear.


On day two, I foraged berries and chopped more firewood. I built a makeshift door using pine branches, wood, and string- to feel more secure. As I worked, I noticed something new: footprints near my tent. They were at least two sizes too small and unmistakably human. I had been wearing my boots the whole time. This detail was edited out completely, though if you pause at 18:35 in the episode, you can spot them in the background of the talking head shot.

Dark, grey clouds gathered, and with the wind shifting, I knew rain was coming. I secured a sheet of tarp around my wickiup and then set off to hunt with my bow. I set out for small game- grouse, squirrels, birds, even deer if I saw one. But something was off in my part of the woods- there were no animals at all. When I watched the show, other contestants were shown hunting and bagging prey, yet I saw nothing. Plan B. I weaved a fish net the best I knew how, tied it to a long branch, and set it on the water’s edge. Then I baited a fishing hook with a berry and cast the line in the water. I had seen pike swimming in the river. One of those promised protein for days. 


If you’re keeping up with the show, they next cut to  me eating cooked fish with a warning text about how the smell of meat attracts bears. I’m chewing slowly and looking over my shoulders- eyes wide and alert. Here’s why.


After fishing, I had returned to find my camp a mess. The door was knocked down, a section of the wall had collapsed, and around the fire lay half-eaten squirrel carcasses. It looked like a bird had viciously ripped their guts open and eaten the innards. An animal must have turned up and made itself at home.


I stored the squirrel remains inside a sack, which I had hung from a half-fallen tree. They’d make good fishing bait. When I lifted the door back up, I noticed a carving on its front: a stick figure without a body and head- just four straight lines at different angles. They were too clean to be mere claw marks.


The storm hit early that evening and raged all night. The rain, the rolling thunder, even the scent of wet pine, fed the dark corners of my imagination. The light from my fire was my only comfort. I woke up in the middle of the night to a cool draft. The door had fallen to the ground. I picked it back up but later that night it fell over again. I ended up spending the night holding the door shut.

Two weeks had passed since the storm- or so I think. I had etched tallies into a tree, but it was still hard to keep track.

There were more incidents, but I was too scared to even think about filming them- more footsteps shifting in the dirt, faces in the darkness, footprints. I didn’t feel comfortable staying at my camp any longer. Something was out there with me, and making it abundantly clear that I was trespassing on its territory.


I went exploring for a better area. Ideally, I wanted to have my camp against a rock wall. I felt too exposed with nothing but open wilderness around me. I remembered a promising spot during one of my hunts- a ten-minute walk away. I would have to dismantle my shelter piece by piece and carry the logs; there was no use letting all my woodchopping go to waste.


What’s weird about this episode is that at the 31:20 mark, they use my audio but not my footage. It’s footage of the ground as someone’s moving. My voice, discussing my doubts about staying, came through faintly, as if detached from whatever is holding the camera. It’s only a ten-second clip, then it cuts to another contestant. 


I did find the spot- a large stone-faced cliff with a hollow scoop at the bottom, framed by trees where I could tie my tarp. I quickly started a small fire so I’d be able to see the smoke and find my way back if I got lost. I walked back to camp and started to dismantle my shelter. It would take all day, but I’d been fairly lucky with the fish, so I could spare the time rather than hunt.


The nights were getting earlier, and darkness was already creeping in. I was worried I might not have my shelter ready in time for night. Usually, that wouldn’t be the worst thing- it wasn’t raining and I hadn’t had any run-ins with wild animals. But the thought of being out here with nothing around me, hearing those footsteps and seeing faces in the dark, terrified me. I was taking the first set of logs back when I heard someone scream. I froze. I must have stood still for ten or more minutes before moving again. I didn’t want to think about it. If it were another contestant, they’d have a radio and could call for help. I dropped off the logs and went back for more. I couldn’t shake the feeling I was being watched. That’s what being alone for weeks does to you. It’s a mental game as much as a physical one.You either get desperate for human contact or you get paranoid. What happened next is something that would never make it to air on Solo Survivor, because logistically it shouldn’t be possible.


“Over here.”


A flat whisper, clear as day. Again, I froze for what felt like forever, staring around me in terror. Each contestant is dropped off a few miles from each other, and they have preventative measures to stop you from getting too close to the other survivors. We have tracking devices on all of us, so they can find our location when we tap out- and I’m sure the production crew knew none of the other survivors were near me at the time.


I wanted nothing more than to tap out right then, but even if I did, the boat would take two hours to arrive, and it would be dark by then. So I kept my head down, moving my shelter piece by piece, until all that was left were the cameras. I went back for them last because they were lighter- only to discover there were at least two missing. Had I lost them in the move? I didn’t particularly care at that moment; I just wanted to feel safe.

I had finished relocating to my shelter now- a shift that confused viewers because my whole move was edited out. It was night, and hunger gnawed at me. I sat inside, making spruce tea over a small fire, the aroma of pine mixing with the damp, cold air. I explained in my voice-over that I had a terrible feeling about this area too and didn’t dare check the fish net in the dark.


The footage they aired, however, wasn’t of me. It was an exterior shot closing in on my shelter. Then a growl was edited in- supposedly of a bear- but what I heard that night was a low, almost whispered murmur: *hhhhuur*, pause, *hhhuur*, pause, *hhhurrr*, pause.


I was so hungry and isolated that I began questioning my sanity, so I just sat up in my shelter staring at the door. I had tied it shut from the inside this time so nothing could pull it open- and that’s what I had begun to believe happened.


Suddenly, something hit the tarp covering my shelter. Instinctively, I shouted, “Hey bear!”


The footage cut to a bear sniffing my tent, but I knew in my gut it wasn’t a bear.


Whatever was there went away and didn’t return for the rest of the night.


When I went outside in the morning, one of my missing cameras was set up on the ground facing my shelter door. It was still recording, but they never aired any of its footage.

I stayed for another five days. I know some will call me crazy, but the $250,000 prize money was too tempting to ignore. I had convinced myself my mind was playing tricks on me. I checked my fishing line daily; aside from one small catch, nothing changed. At this point I was seriously hungry, and was left with no choice but to try hunting for small game in the woods again.


I took my bow, hunting knife, and a canteen full of water. There were still no animals that I could see, but I knew they had to be here- because where else had those squirrels come from? I headed deeper into the woods, following a small, trickling stream. I figured animals need water, so they would be near its source. 


Finally, I was getting somewhere. I could hear twigs snapping, leaves crunching underfoot. It’s funny how hunger does that to you. You’re so focused on getting that next meal you ignore every warning sign. I followed the sounds until I saw a structure ahead of me. This is where they cut my footage. What I had found was a shelter. I couldn’t have possibly stumbled across another survivor’s camp; I hadn’t walked that far.


I went closer to look at the shelter. With every step, my stomach grew colder and colder. The shelter looked exactly like mine- down to the four-pronged marking on the door. Outside, one of my cameras was aimed toward the camp. Someone had seen my setup. Someone had recreated it. Someone had stolen my cameras. What the fuck was going on?


That’s when I heard a rustle from inside the shelter. I stared at it, and I could feel something staring back at me through the cracks. The door shifted- and I ran. I tore through the woods, dropping my camera as twigs clawed at my face and roots twisted my step. Even when I got back to my camp, I ran right past it until I reached the shore, where there were no trees and it was a wide-open area. I radioed in that I was tapping out and stood there for two, painful hours, gripping my hunting knife.

That was the end of my run on the show. They portrayed it as if I were a coward, paranoid about bears. When I demanded answers about what was truly happening, they dismissed me- just another survivor who got in his head. In the end, I had been out there for a month.


They took me to a facility where they feed you, hook you up to IVs, run medical tests, and keep you until you are deemed ready to go home. I tried explaining what happened in the woods, but they laughed it off. There’s always someone who gets scared, they said.


Later, while waiting, another survivor tapped out. They asked if I wanted to see him and I said yes. I remembered Charlie, from our brief time together before being dropped off. I asked him about his experiences. He recounted an intense night when he was stalked by wolves.


“Did you actually see them?” I pressed. “How did you know they were wolves?” 


He replied simply, “They’re wolves- I know what they sound like,” but his hesitation when I asked suggested there was more to it than that.


Although I didn’t win, I received a call last night- the production studio offered me a $100K prize. When I asked what it was for, they wouldn’t say; they just insisted I deserved it. A lawyer even called, asking if I had seen anything unusual. I didn’t have much to report, and that was enough for them. They handed me an NDA to sign- in exchange for the money. Of course, I didn’t sign it. I couldn’t let them erase the truth. They send us out into the woods, and clearly, they don’t control what’s out there. That’s why I quit the show- I was fucking terrified. I was NOT alone out there, and I can’t believe they’re editing it to make me look crazy.
