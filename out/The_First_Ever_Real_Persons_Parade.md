I wandered down to the "First Ever Real Persons' Parade!" today. 

And yes. Yes I learned so... Much. 

And yes, I'm still here, in the bathroom. Still me, still real. I promise.

But, for clarity, let me explain:

I made coffee first thing, as always, and stood at the kitchen window. Like I tend to do. The low bluegray predawn glass, cold and still. A muted saffron skyline. 

And then, immediately, out there over the sawtooth slopes of neighborhood rooftops, simply jogging along, there he was: 

An ordinary man of ordinary build (if not a bit narrow in the shoulders, being completely fair). He wore a red sweater and baby-blue running shorts. And everything was so normal, so unremarkable about him, save for his face.

His face:

Sheet-white and round, perfectly round--like a porcelain dinner plate--and on this flat, perfectly round and sheet-white face were the features, features you might expect on any face, 

Only all wrong. 

It was as though someone had splotched on the eyes--those great striking blue eyes--like a drunken sculptor, smearing the cherry red lips into a perpetual shout. No hint of a recognizeable emotion in the floundering wide O the mouth was making, and the longer I watched, the less it seemed to change. The face was, above all, without depth or shape.

The jogger had a two dimensional face.

I watched him, frozen. Breathless. He was barely out of view when a couple came strolling into view down the same sidewalk, heading the same direction.  To my horror, their faces were just as flat. Missing noses. Giant painted-on eyes of woad, terrible screaming mouths. 

But there was clearly esprit in their gait. Wherever they were going, they were on a mission.

I decided to throw on my coat and head downstairs. 

To follow them.

Out the door. A burst of sweet morning chill, the little glittering songs of chickadees in frostbit hedges. Cloying drafts of diesel fumes off scant early traffic. When I round the corner, there's a small crowd gathered. All their faces flat and round and made of porcelain. They've lined the sidewalks; I had the feeling they were waiting for something to begin. They waited in silence. No one spoke. 

Then came the floats. Or what should have been floats:

Enormous white gloves. Like the gloves of early cartoon animals--all balloony and wrong. They came sulking out of a thick fog suddenly draped like a curtain over the south end of the city. Between two of these hulking giants, lumbering along on their balloony digits, was strung a banner. In huge block letters, it read

THE FIRST ANNUAL REAL PEOPLES' PARADE!

I turned. Glared wildly about for someone who was actually real, real like me.

Finally I located an old man at the bus stop on the corner. A face of browned leather, chiseled, forged over brow and valley. My kind of human. 

I ran to him.

"Do you see this lunacy?" I cried, waving wildly at the general viscinity of the scene. "What the hell IS all this?"

He just sort of shrugged and watched. Now there were things, what appeared to be great lumbering corgis made out of something like cottage cheese. The flat-faced people were riding atop their curdled humps, wearing the bold little uniforms and fez caps of the Shriners. The giant corgis left thick white skids in the street as the strode by. 

"I think it's nice," said the old man. "You don't think it's nice?"

"It's the most awful thing," I murmured.

"But aren't you one of... Aren't you like... Aren't you with them?" 

I stared at the old man. That deep concern in his dark hazel gaze...

I rushed immediately back up to my apartment. Stood in front of the medicine cabinet. And I was going to look in the mirror.

I REALLY AM going to look in the mirror. I'm here now, in the sallow linoleum safety of the bathroom, and I'm going to prove to myself any second now that I'm real. That I'm not one of porcelain people, that they're an abomination and I am most definitely real.

Or I can stand here forever. Because there must be a space, a safe and silvered lining between that which we call REAL and FAKE. An interstitial state, homeostatic stillness. 

If I never see, it won't ever be. I'll just... Stand.

Not waiting. Just... 

Unreal.
