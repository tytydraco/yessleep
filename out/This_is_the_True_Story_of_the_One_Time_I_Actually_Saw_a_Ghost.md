 I had recently moved to an old town – a very different place from the modern crowded city where I used to live. 

I did not like it. The snootiness of the locals, feeling so much superior for simply having been born in this ancient place, with its handful old yellow churches- who even goes to church anymore? Their accent got on my nerves- I seemed to mis-hear or misunderstand every other word. And the winding roads and old cobbly streets- even holding up my phone maps I was constantly getting lost and I felt that Google himself had forsaken this old place. 

But, you have to move for work these days, and I really had no choice. And what kind of adult complains about having no friends and family where they live? Not me. I am a busy man, no time for that sort of nonsense. 

In those days, I drove a lot for my work , visiting various sites and offices. My new workplace had an arrangement in place with the local car rental agency and we had to rent cars for work trip, so even though I disliked driving strange cars, I had no choice but to get a rental- at least, that’s what the admin girl told me. She said it was for insurance- but much later I learned it was because the agency was run by the cousin of the receptionist’s fiancé, the brother of the admin girl- just so typical of how things are done in this damn old town.

I didn’t know that at the time- I just felt discombobulated at driving a strange car in an unfamiliar town.

I entered the agency to pick the car. I had asked for the GPS system- if navigating the downtown area was hard enough for me, the outskirts of this churchy old town might as well be a different planet. Not to mention how all the place names, suburbs and nearby towns had bizarre ancient names, adding to my spatial confusion.

I tapped in the address I was visiting that day. It was barely an hour away. The sun was shining, and as I drove away from the main downtown districts following the GPS instructions which led me onto the highway and into the countryside, I felt my irritation melting. 

My mind relaxed into enjoying the spectacular winter scenery zipping outside my window. The world shrank into the pleasant voice of the GPS, snow-covered pines and firs outside, the grey highway, and occasionally, a small smashed and mutilated furry body. 

“*In 10 kilometers take Exit 222A Northern trunk...”*

*“In 2 kilometers…”*

*“In 500 meters…”*

*“Stop. You have now arrived at your destination.”*

A furious honking of horns and cars whizzing by shattered the driving daze that had fogged my brain. 

I had braked right in the middle of the highway, just outside a concealed exit. 

A giant truck, honking, swerved around me.

I lifted my foot from the brake pedal. Confused , I drove to the shoulder just before the exit, and then braked again, coming to a full stop. I even pulled the hand-brake- I simply didn’t want to move. My earlier discombobulation came roaring back.

*“Proceed to the route.”*

I looked at the cars flashing down the highway and began feeling in my pockets for my cellphone. I had no idea where I was, and the glowing map on the GPS meant nothing to me.

“Proceed. To. The. **ROUTE**!” barked the GPS. 

The voice was no longer smooth and pleasant, but an angry growl.

Red lights flashed on the device.

Someone tapped at the window. 

I yelped, dropped my phone, dived down and as I came back up, I saw her: a woman with half of her skull crushed at the car window on the driver side, leaning in towards me. The cars whizzed by behind her, and the sun shone through the snowy trees. 

“Please. Proceed to the route.” said the GPS softly, no longer an angry growl, but a desperate plea.

The terrible woman outside my car looked at me with her one good eye. Her jaw was shattered, teeth hanging loose in the torn tissue of the lower half of the face. 

*The animals lying mutilated in the highway, by the highway.* 

Bones, brains, and hair. My own brain was jumping around furiously. 

I shook his head and closed my eyes, in an effort to block the sight and make my brain stop jumping. I gripped the steering wheel, my phone on my lap, and willed the woman to disappear.

*“Proceed to the route. Please. I’m lonely, just like you. You’re in my car.”*

Cars swept by.

The tapping on the window continued.

With my eyes still closed, I opened my mouth with difficulty. “Go away, please.”

*“You’re in my car. Proceed to the route. I just want to talk, please”*

A dry sob escaped my throat. I punched the ignition button, pressing down on the gas pedal as hard as I could, and let down the hand brake. 

To my utter disbelief, I heard the engine come back on. I opened my eyes, and began to swerve out of the shoulder, back onto the highway.

*“*Stop! You have arrived at your **DESTINATION***.”* The GPS’s voice raised to a growl on the last word.

I kept pressing on the gas pedal, the engine roared. 

The mangled woman was banging on the windows with her one good hand, the other dangling uselessly by her, bones poking out of the torn flesh. 

I remember thinking, if she’s dead, how is her fist making that impact against the car windows?

*“Stop. Please. You have arrived at you destination. Get out.”*

I didn’t stop. As I drove as fast as I could away from the stretch of death, the woman fell back, unable or unwilling to leave that spot on the highway. 

A loud wailing shriek of agony came out of the GPS.

*“No no no, proceed to the route, no! In 250 metres, make a U turn…NO!”*

I put more kilometres between myself and the death spot, and the GPS’s wailing grew silent. I drove frantically along miles of highway, unable to stop, unable to think, only desperate to get away.

I moved away from that town and company as soon as I could, and I never saw her again. 

I am a busy man, no time for that sort of nonsense.
