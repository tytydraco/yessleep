The second story I’ve got started out completely regular, about ten years into my exterminating career. The assignment was listed as “Roach Infestation.”

The house was pleasant. Lots of plants, bird feeders and fountains, and a grand elm tree branching out over the grass. I dodged a sprinkler and rang the doorbell. The woman who answered the door looked to be in her forties, with straight, blonde hair, and was wearing a velvet robe over a loose-fitting, white t-shirt. Said her name was Stephanie.

“Everywhere I go, there’s a cockroach. I don’t know where they’re holing up.” She swung her glass of lemonade towards the different rooms and the stairs. “I see probably eight of them a day. I can’t kill them. I can’t even pick one up with a paper towel. I’ve never dealt well with bugs.”

Roaches are common in Blinkville. Plenty of households deal with ‘em, but plenty of people don’t wanna have to deal with them at all so they call me. If she really were seeing eight of them a day, though, that was quite the infestation.

I told her I’d probably just make an inspection today and return the next to get to work on ‘em. I’d been an exterminator for about ten years at this point. The toenail beetle was a good story to tell, but it was about the only story I had. At this point, the job wasn’t just a job anymore, it was habitual. Meaning I got through my tasks fairly quickly, leaving room for more assignments.

As soon as I got to work, Stephanie started playing a record. Some 60’s rock song. That kind that that has you picturing dudes surfing and girls drinking Coke from the bottle. It wasn’t too odd, it was just the way she hurried to put the record on right after I said I’d start the inspection.

I got done with the first floor and headed upstairs. Stephanie was in the kitchen. I hadn’t seen her, only heard her talking. Thought she must’ve been on the phone, but still found it strange with all that music playing. After finding some good spots to place bait, I made my way back down, the music becoming clearer as I went. The song was all, “You’re the apple of my eye,” and “Can’t nobody love you like I love you right now,” but over the singer’s cliches, I could hear Stephanie.

“It’ll be just me and you again.”

I walked into the kitchen and her back was turned to me, kind of hunched over the counter.

“You want some cake?”

I wasn’t sure if she was talking to me, but I was here to tell her I was done anyways.

“Ma’am?”

She spun around, clearly unaware of my presence until now.

“Oh! Hi.”

“I’m all done with the inspection…”

I glanced at the counter, where a cockroach was sat. Right where she’d been facing. It was noticeably pretty big for a cockroach. An adult cockroach is typically one to one and a half inches long, and I’d guess this one was about five inches long.

“Oh my lord,” I pointed to the roach.

“Ah,” she glanced at the roach, “Yes.”

“I can show you how to deal with one if you-.”

“Oh no,” she held out a hand, “This one’s…good.”

“It’s good?”

“He…uh, he’s fine.”

“I’m sorry?”

“It’s just all the other roaches I need rid of. This one can stay.”

I raised an eyebrow.

She continued, “It’s…well, it’s hard to explain.”

“I’m sure.”

“Okay…” She thought for a second, tapping her slippered foot. “Okay, look at this.”

She went into the next room with the record player and lifted the arm. The music stopped. She came back and watched the roach sit there for a bit. Then, as if it made up its mind about something, it scurried off. Crawled itself down the counter and towards a vent in the floor. I began to go after it, almost instinctively, forgetting what she’d just said. It was such a big cockroach, and I’m used to crushing any I see, but she raised her voice.

“No no no!”

I stopped.

“Let him go,” she said calmly.

The roach was gone.

“Okay,” she said, then went back into the next room and the music snapped on after a second. She came back into the room holding a vinyl cover with five guys on the front. It said “The Zombies” in the bottom left corner and “Begin Here” in the bottom right. The roach came crawling out of the vent and back up on the counter. Stephanie walked close to it and crouched down, hugging the vinyl cover. “Hiya, Trav!” she said to the roach like it was a cute puppy.

She turned and walked over to me, holding out the vinyl cover. “This was my husband - er - ex-husband’s favorite album.”

“Uh huh,” I said, eyes on the cockroach sitting still on the countertop.

“This cockroach always comes up on the counter when it’s playing.” She pointed back at the bug without looking at it. “Sits right there and waits for me to feed it something nice. Then, I’ll go and watch a movie in the den and he’ll follow. Now get this,” she brought her pointer finger away from the roach and up between us, “He’ll only stay if I put on a movie my ex-husband liked.”

I couldn’t believe this shit.

“Okay…,” is all I managed.

“There’s more. It’s the way he…*behaves*. It’s just like him - Travis, my ex-husband.”

“I see…”

“It’s…it’s *him*. I know it sounds crazy, but I just…there’s no getting around it. Travis died a year ago. He…he had a lot of ex-wives and I wasn’t his last - he left me for another woman. And I think this is some sort of divine punishment for his unfaithfulness. I mean - a roach! He’s been brought back as a cockroach! And look! He’s chosen me! Or *has* been chosen: to be in my house and live out his roach life with me! I never married again but all those other wives did. So he’s been placed back with me!”

An orange cat came out of the room with the record player and leaped onto the counter, with eyes on the roach. It crept up and began to slowly raise its paw as it approached the roach. I pointed behind Stephanie. “Your cat’s about to-.”

“Scarlett!” She stomped a couple steps towards the cat and it scampered off back into the room it came from.

“Is that one of his ex-wives, reincarnated as a cat,” I joked. I regretted letting that slip when she turned around.

“This is not a joke!” She looked offended by what I said. “I know it sounds crazy, but stranger things have happened!”

*I’m not sure they have*. Made the wise move of keeping that one in my head.

“Look,” she sighed. “I just want you to take care of all the other cockroaches. I’ll play this record so he stays in here with me and he’s away from the others while you do your thing.”

It was insane and stupid, but if it’s what she wanted, then who was I to argue? Whatever would make for a happy customer.

I ended up stacked with urgent assignments for a neighborhood that was reusing some old pool houses with bad infestations, so I didn’t return to Stephanie’s until two days later. I got there and she was wearing the same outfit, sipping lemonade in the kitchen, when I saw a roach crawl from her back and into her robe pocket. It wasn’t the big roach that was on the counter the day before. She saw that I noticed and let out a shy laugh.

“Yes, I actually have something I wanted to tell you before you got started today. It seems Travis has some…friends. He hangs out with some of the other cockroaches.”

I watched another crawl from her sleeve up to her shoulder, slipping into the neckline of her shirt.

“It shouldn’t be a problem, though, as you can see. They’ve all gotten pretty accustomed to me as well, so you can still go around taking care of the rest of them. His friends will stick to me.”

Now this was becoming an ethical concern. The one roach she wanted to keep around, fine. I was under the impression she wasn’t coming into close contact with it. That she didn’t *want* close contact with *any* cockroach. But now she wanted more of ‘em and was happy to house them in her robe. I was convinced she had a mental illness, and that soon enough she’d have a physical illness to worry about due to the pathogens roaches carry. All of this was way out of my wheelhouse. She needed a damn psychiatrist.

Another cockroach crawled from her shoulder and into her hair. Went across her cheek, just passed her eye, and she didn’t flinch. I sure as hell did, though. She found that funny.

“Aren’t you used to these critters by now,” she laughed.

“Ma’am,” I was at a loss for words. “This…you can’t be having this many-. Look, you’re gonna get sick. E. coli or salmonella or a real bad fever. I’m not comfortable leaving you with these…diseases all over you.”

She rolled her eyes as if I were prejudiced. “I have a feeling you still don’t believe me.”

I frowned.

“About Travis, I mean. You don’t think that roach upstairs is Travis.”

“Upstairs?”

“Yes, he’s even sleeping in our bed now. I don’t even have to play the record anymore. He listens to me. He’s walking around the house, making it a home just like Travis would’ve.”

I needed to call someone else in. Before I knew it, she’d probably change her mind about the whole extermination and keep all the goddamn roaches.

Stephanie must’ve seen the worrisome doubt on my face. “Go on upstairs and see for yourself. I think that would help.”

“I don’t think I need to see…Travis. This whole thing…” I rubbed my eyes.

“You’re gonna have to go up there anyways,” she offered. “To kill the others.”

So I went up and opened her bedroom door to find a meter long cockroach sat on the bed. Long, thin antennas swaying. Six arched legs with spikes sprouting from them. The lines of hard shell covering wings, now more detailed in its size. Bland, unfeeling, brown eyes on either side of its head, possibly gazing at me or completely unaware I was there. His favorite record was playing on the other side of the bed.

“Jesus Christ!” I turned around and slammed the door. Stephanie was waiting on the stairs behind me.

“I know he’s a cockroach now, but there’s no need to be rude!” One roach crawled from her foot and up her leg, disappearing beneath the robe; another skittered across her neck to her back.

“What the hell happened?” I pulled on the knob behind me to make sure the door was shut. “He was big the other day, but not *giant*!”

“I suppose it’s all the food he’s eating,” she shrugged. “He’s been eating every meal I make. Has two breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. Maybe he’ll be human sized for his human soul. I don’t know how these things work.”

She stepped towards me and I practically jumped out of the way. There was a roach moving around her body every time I looked at her. As I went out of the way, I stepped on a cockroach. She was at the door and turned to see its remains as I lifted my foot. “Oh, that wasn’t one of his friends,” she said reassuringly. “No worries.” She flashed a kind smile and went into the room Travis was laying in. “Travy! Your friends are here!”

I went downstairs and called my uncle. In those days, retirement caused him to be more laid-back, more open. Likely because he had more time to drink. But that, plus my older age,  allowed for looser conversation between the two of us.

“Hello!”

“I don’t know where to start. This woman thinks this cockroach is her dead ex-husband and it’s fucking huge!”

“Well, is it?”

“Is it what?”

“Is it her dead ex-husband?”

I almost screamed in anger. “What does that even *mean*?”

“I’m fucking with you, kid. She’s just caught under the roach’s spell.”

“The fuck?”

“Roaches are ancient creatures, son. Prehistoric.” I heard him slurp a beer. “Not a whole lot of them originate from the ancient line anymore, but we’ve got some in Blinkville. It looks like you’ve got yourself one of them. They found themselves a victim they could manipulate and are thriving off of her. You kill that big one, and from there, it’s just like any other job. Rid of the infestation. Easy peasy.”

“Uh huh,” I held the bridge of my nose in a pinch, “Easy peas-.”

“SCARLETT!” I heard Stephanie scream from upstairs, over the war cries of her cat.

“For fuck’s sake,” I muttered as I hung up the phone.

“SCARLETT, NO! TRAVIS, STOP! BOTH OF YOU!”

I ran upstairs and saw the cat swatting at the giant roach, as “Travis” moved his jaws hesitantly, trying to grab the cat with his many, spiky legs.

I turned and ran for my car, grabbing my insecticide pack and strapping it on my back before heading back inside. I ran back to the stairs, where Staphanie could be heard screaming and crying from her bedroom.

“Scarlett…! Travis, how could you? How could you? I TOLD YOU TO STOP!”

I ran up, stopping at the banister and looking into the bedroom, where I saw “Travis” ripping apart the remains of Scarlett, devouring her in rapid succession. Roaches have got two sets of jaws: large palps and small palps. Travis’ palps were twitching up and down, left and right, pulling Scarlett apart, who was no longer making any noise. Stephanie, on the other hand, was still wailing, hands on her head.

“Get off of me! Get off!” She screamed, thrashing the roaches from her body. She flung off her robe and threw roaches to the ground, stomping on them. She began to yell out in pain as some of them seemed to bite her back, but she didn’t stop retaliating.

Then Travis paused his meal to look up at Stephanie and exhale a “Hssssssssss,” slowly as he stumbled forward off the bed and towards her. I walked into the doorway as Stephanie continued to thrash around, moving into the bathroom behind her and locking the door. Travis crawled up to the door as I prepared myself. The record was still going: “Sticks and stones may break my bones, But talk don’t bother me.”

His back was towards me so I took my chances while I had ‘em. I turned the nozzle on my sprayer to make sure it sprayed as wide as possible, and I let loose. The spray went out and down, raining on Travis’ dark, shiny back. He exuded another emotionless, “Hssssssssss,” as he rotated around rather quickly and skittered in my direction. Could’ve been because I was up close and personal now, but he seemed even larger than he’d been moments earlier.

I backed up and continued spraying but he approached me in a second. I hopped over the bed to get some distance and sprayed over to the other side of the bed, spraying in an arc right on top of him. I’d seen him crawl down from the bed earlier. It wasn’t an easy climb for his straight, rigid body.

He didn’t seem to have much trouble climbing up the wall behind him, though, skittering up and onto the ceiling. I continued spraying, but he was hanging over me before I knew it, and if I sprayed directly above me it would come raining back down on my face. I stopped spraying as he crawled down to the wall on my side of the room. I turned and sprayed him as I backed up, the bed behind me stopping me in my tracks. Travis crawled down to my height on the wall and I saw his wings start to flicker from his shell.

“Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck,” I repeated as I tumbled backwards over the bed, just grazing the cat’s mutilated corpse as I fell on the other side and stood up to Travis flying right at me. His wings flashed and buzzed as he hissed. It took a second for the spray to start going again after I had rolled over with it on my back, so I tried to hold him back with a kick. He latched his bottom two spiky legs onto mine, and pulled himself forward. His thin antennas were swinging around, grazing my hair and face, his four jaws approaching my chest, wriggling every which way. “Hssssssss.” I socked him across the face every time it appeared a palp would sink into me.

I sprayed all over him and shook my leg as hard as I could but he didn’t stop. His wings collapsed back into his shell and he attached to me. The full length of his body ran from my foot to my chest. We were face to face. His head was getting closer and closer, antennas now above me and jaws right in front. Dark brown, sleek face approaching mine; white mites sprinkled all over, inching around the brown. I felt his other two spiky limbs scratching against my back, trying to sink them into me but having trouble due to the insecticide pack. I could see the beige, bony arches of his belly pressed against my chest. I stuck my long sprayer in between myself and him and pried him back, pulling him slowly apart from myself, yanking his spikes out of my leg, and finally getting him onto his back.

He was laid on the ground, hard shell against the carpet, the record singing, “Can’t they let us be?” and all of Travis’ limbs - legs, jaws, antennas - twitching around like mad. I laid down the spray on him until the twitching and hissing ceased. And then I sprayed some more.

Once I was content, I took off my pack and collapsed against the wall behind me. I was sitting on the ground when the next song came on, the one I’d heard the previous day, going, “Can’t nobody love you, Like I’m loving you baby,” when the bathroom door finally opened back up and Stephanie peeked out. Her hair was wet and she had gooey cockroach blood splattered in a pattern up and down her body.

“Travis…?” She asked nervously.

“Maybe next time he’ll come back as a butterfly,” I said in about the most annoyed tone I could muster. I still had to take care of the regular cockroaches that were infesting her house.

I took a *long* shower that night before calling my uncle.

“Hello!”

“Don’t you think you could warn me about some of these things before I have to deal with them myself?”

“Huh?”

“The cockroach! The massive cockroach that had that woman ‘under its spell!’ If you’ve dealt with stuff like this, it would be nice to have some preparation!”

“What good would that have done?”

“Are you kidding?”

“You’ve got to deal with these things yourself, kid. One day, you may encounter something on a job that no one else has dealt with. Who’s gonna offer advice then? You’ve got to learn how to adapt quickly, in the heat of the moment. Ain’t that what you did with that toenail critter a ways back?”

“Yeah…yeah, whatever. I guess.”

“How ‘bout you come over and we talk about it over some beers?”

“Alright, you old fart.”

I got off the phone and took another shower before I left.
