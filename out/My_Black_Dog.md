I started seeing him sometime after my 36th birthday. It was a pretty uneventful month that came and went. My wife made my favorite pie but for the most part, we were more concerned with bills and one of us finding better work. The next month as I opened yet another medical bill before bed, I glanced outside my window and saw a tall gaunt figure. He wore a ragged black shirt and grey pants that ended soaking wet and torn. Filth from the streets reached back up to his ankles from pale grey feet. A black and thin hooded robe clung to him like a second skin. He opened his arms wide and bowed in a mocking introduction.  
  
I yelled for my wife and went to grab my bat. She charged in and I pointed out the window as I made my way to the door. She grabbed me to keep me inside, another reason she’ll likely live longer than me. We looked out all the windows, but no one was around. I alerted our neighbors, and one came out with me to look around but came up short. I figured maybe it was just a homeless guy, who made his way up from one of the bus stops downtown. We decided to keep an eye out and eventually I put it out of my mind.   
  
About a month had passed and I’m on a walk in the early afternoon for a break. I was lost deep in thought when I stopped at the fork in the path. Clear as day next to a tree in the fork was the same guy. His hood fully obscured his face until he craned his neck to allow the sunlight to catch his crooked smile. It was wide with needle-sharp teeth encased by chapped bleeding lips. He presented some rope from behind as if it were a game show prize. “Come on down.” He rasped then giggled. It reminded me of a child as I turned and ran. When I looked over my shoulder he was gone again; the rope coiled on the ground where I stood.   
  
The Grey Man, as I call him, started appearing more frequently. Off to the side of the road peeking from behind poles; Smiling down at me from the top of parking garages; and in lakes, head just above the water where it was coldest and far from shore. This taught me that no one else could see him as they swam just a few feet away with no recognition of the gaunt grinning monstrosity.   
  
The worst of it happened at home. I caught him from my periphery, grinning from behind a crack in the bedroom door. By the time I registered him, it was too late. I heard a raspy “Knock Knock” before a belt looped around my neck and he yanked me into the room. I tried to cry out, but only desperate gasps escaped. I thrashed and clawed behind me for my attacker as my legs kicked out. I finally grabbed hold of the belt strap from behind and pulled toward the loop to try and loosen the belt. It went slack in my hands as I undid it and I jumped to my feet to find no one. I was alone again.  
  
I was at my wit's end. I tried to go to my friends, family, and anyone who I trusted to help but as time went on there was little, they could do to find the guy and most of them grew frustrated. Many just gave up and walked away, a few said to just text when he shows up again, and one was happy to regale me on stories of poltergeists and hauntings. He means well but I think he’s more interested in telling me new facts than anything that helps.  
  
My wife eventually grew agitated and annoyed whenever I would bring up The Grey Man. She was usually a patient person, so it came as a shock when she eventually dismissed me outright.  “It’s not that I don’t believe you. I just wonder if you ignored him if he might go away. Cause there’s nothing else you can do about it.” She said curtly before she left one morning.  
  
I watched her leave for work from the front window and felt cold thin fingers rest gently on my shoulders. A rancid whisper warmed my ear “I’m your little Black Dog Love. I’ll always find you.” Before I was alone again.  
  
I’ve tried every ritual, prayer, incense, and holy man. I’m out of ideas. I’m afraid that one day he’ll succeed and drag me away and I just want to warn everyone, anyone. I’m scared. I can feel him behind me; the shifting of his robes; his dragging footsteps; and that soft rhythmic giggle.  
  
I don’t know if any of this is helpful, but I pray it helps whoever else may come across or has even met him already. Hell, maybe this is the last bit of my hope of reaching out for anything that can still help. I’ve never been very religious, but if things like this are out free to stalk us as they please, then may God help those chosen.
