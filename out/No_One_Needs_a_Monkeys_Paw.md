You're wrong about how monkey's paws work, you know. Well, not *wrong*, exactly, but close enough.    

See, you don't *need* the paw. If you live a relatively normal life and die when you're supposed to, of relatively natural causes, you're actually guaranteed three "paw" wishes in your lifetime. Everyone is. You know how Christians say stuff like "God always answers prayers, just not always in the way you expect"? Those are paw wishes. Ask them for personal examples next time. None of them will have more than three. If they do, cut them out of your life. *Immediately*.   

See, the only way to get more "paw" wishes is to take someone else's. I'm sure you can figure out how to do that. I did say you have to live a *full* life and die of *natural* causes to be guaranteed all of your wishes, after all.    

The point of an actual, physical monkey's paw is to increase the chances of a particular wish being granted (or to see how many wishes you have left). If you luck out and get a genuine monkey's paw, it'll *almost* guarantee--it's like a 99.8% chance--whatever wishes you make while holding it will come true. Without it, every wish, every prayer, has a 100% chance, minus one percent for each year you have left to live in your intended lifespan. If you're meant to live until you're 100, then, you don't even have a 50% chance until your fiftieth birthday. If you're meant to die at 50, you've got a 75% chance when you're 25. Not bad odds, really. Once you've used your three, though, that's it.    

Self-inflicted "natural" deaths don't count for increasing your chances, either. If you were meant to live until your nineties, smoke a pack a day, and die of lung cancer in your thirties with all three wishes left, too bad. Those wishes go to some big executive at the tobacco company. You have a heart attack because you ate fast food every day and never exercised? The CEO of McDonald's thanks you for your contribution. Allergic reaction to a co-worker eating a Reese's in the next cubicle? That bastard has no idea what they just gained from their lack of consideration. But if you happen to have asthma or breast cancer or whatever it is that runs in your family, well, no one is really at fault for that, are they? Those wishes are all yours.    

Why else do you think death is such a big business? Everything is meant to kill us somehow. The big-name executives, the rich and powerful, those bastard politicians who seem to stay in office long past their expiration dates and keep starting new wars with each other--they figured this shit out years ago. That's why they push us so close to death every chance they get. The teenager that cooked the burger that broke the camel's back and caused your neighbor's heart attack, the soldier who pulled the trigger to save his own hide in the trenches of a foreign country, fighting a war for something he doesn't even believe in--well, they're not *really* the ones responsible for those deaths, are they? The universe, or demons, or whatever higher power is in charge of the distribution of wishes--they certainly don't seem to think so. Any wishes that get stolen from those actions always go to the higher-ups--the people who put the unwilling or unwitting killers in those situations in the first place. The only way people like you and me get extra wishes us through our own actions, things we can actually control: driving drunk, exposing someone to an allergen, straight-up homicide--those would all give you however many wishes your victim had left. I can't imagine how many you'd get for taking out a president or, like, Jeff Bezos. Those fuckers have to be *rolling* in wishes, and they don't even have to lift a finger to get them.    

But I'm sure you're wondering how I know all this. I'm just some random fuck on the internet. You wouldn't know me from Moses.    

The thing is, I've done it. I've used two of my wishes. I'm only 25, so I'm either extremely lucky or extremely unlucky, depending on how you look at it.    

I used the first one when I was seven. My home life wasn't the greatest, and I desperately wanted to get out. But I didn't just want a new home. I wanted to have control over my life. I didn't wish to leave or get a new family or anything like that. No, I wished to be an adult. Well, I prayed it--I was still a Christian back then. I thought I was smart about it, too. I *specifically* prayed that I would just ... wake up as an adult, not have to live through all of the pain and suffering and fights and beatings, but I added that I wanted to have memories of the life I was skipping over. I knew if I woke up without my memories, I'd be a mess. I was a smart kid.    

Problem is, not that I knew it then, but it doesn't work that way. You know how monkey's paw wishes work, of course. There will *always* be a downside to getting a paw wish granted, and no, you're not allowed to set stipulations on what that downside might be. Whatever entity is in charge of making these wishes come true doesn't consider these would-be regulations as part of the wish. If anything, it gets annoyed by them. After all, if someone gives you a gift, it's *rude* to complain about the wrapping, right? So when you try and specify, "I really don't want Paw Patrol wrapping paper on my birthday presents; I'm turning 24, and you know how I feel about the police state they live in," what would a *good* friend do other than use Paw Patrol paper on their gift, convince everyone else to use Paw Patrol paper on *their* gifts, get a Paw Patrol cake, and hire a furry in a Chase costume off Craigslist to come strip at your party in front of all of your guests and God and your parents and leave you with what would be lasting trauma if you weren't so traumatized already that you can't form new memories, all in the name of a fun prank?    

Maybe I just had weird friends.    

But anyway, that's how the Wish-Granter works. I don't really know if it's malicious, or a fun prank for it, or some fucked combination of both, but I *do* know that, if you try to tell it what it can and can't do, it'll do exactly the opposite. It'll grant the base wish, sure, but anything else is not only on the table, it's the main course.    

So, yeah. I woke up as an adult. But I didn't get to keep my memories. Or, to be more precise, I got to keep some, but my access to them is spotty, and I have a really, *really* hard time making new memories. Every day, I wake up and have to think about who I am, what I'm doing, what I did the day before. If I don't put *everything* on my calendar--from birthdays to my work schedule to "brush your teeth!!!"--I just won't remember. I've lost friends, jobs, and teeth because of things I forgot, and I can't even remember what I lost unless I focus or it's especially relevant to a conversation--then things just kind of fall out of my mouth without me thinking about them, but I probably won't remember what I said later. I've taken to keeping a voice recorder app on my phone going 24/7 and transferring everything to my computer at the end of the day, assuming I remembered to put that in my calendar.

Yeah, I know, that makes me an unreliable narrator, but just hear me out. I know what I'm talking about.    

The thing is, my second wish--I hadn't figured all this out then, or I never would have made it--was to *understand*. I was living a life that I don't remember building, trying to overcome a bunch of trauma I don't remember happening, and with my religious background, like so many former Christians before me, just wanted to know *why. Why* did I have to suffer so much? *Why* don't I get to live my own life? *Why* is there pain, and heartache, and misery everywhere I turn?    

Well, I got understanding.     

I've spent the past *year* understanding.     

Do you want to know *why* we don't understand?    

Because it hurts. It hurts so much. I'm in constant pain now, and I can't do a damn thing about it. It's not just a headache; my body simply can't withstand the amount of pure *understanding* I feel all of the time. It's different from knowledge. Any fool with infinite knowledge can say it hurts, and yeah, they can tell you how the furry stripper *got* the Chase fursuit and go in depth about the abuse that poor bastard had to suffer while his little brother watched Paw Patrol in the next room, but they won't physically experience what that man feels every time they think about him. They can tell you that they know you're reading this because of this or that or the other thing, but they don't feel how depressed you've been like I do, how broken you are, how *des*perate you are to find either some emotion or some new truth about the world in my words, anything to give *mean*ing to your sad excuse for a life. I *do*.    

Oh, I've made you uncomfortable now. You're annoyed that I've *called you out* so wholly, a little angry that I've insulted you, and just ever so slightly frightened. That's normal. We don't like to feel *seen* by a stranger like this. Please ignore the feeling that you're being watched. The tingle that you don't *quite* feel on the back of your neck, the feeling of dread, unsure if it should join you yet, settling right below your sternum before it drops into your stomach, even the fact that you're breathing manually right now--those are all natural responses to feeling *seen*. To feeling like someone *understands* you. I promise, there's no need to worry about me like that. I'm just as human as you are, and besides, I won't even remember writing this in the morning, if we even have that long. I only wanted to prove to you how much I understand. I need you to take me seriously, and this will be a lot easier on both of us if you calm down.    

You see, I'm obviously not the only one that's figured this out. Problem is, I was never supposed to. This is privileged information, meant only for the rich, the powerful, the *elite*. I'm not one of them. I'm just some dumb fuck from Mississippi that the Wish-Granter played a cosmic prank on.    

And I understand what happens to people with privileged information.     

I've spent the past few months in hiding. I understood why they were coming for me before they even decided to make a move. I'm off the grid, as little contact with others as possible. It's a lot harder than you'd think, escaping everything, what with phones and security cameras and cars tracking every move we make, every word we say, every thought we think. It's not just for the money--they want to know our weaknesses, what makes us tick, what vices are most likely to do us in. That's how they send you targeted ads about shit you've never even said out loud, by the way: one of those rich fucks wished to know the best way to get more wishes, and he was granted knowledge on what every person thinks they want at any given time. Of course, he had no way to use that knowledge himself, so after a lot of money and time spent on professionals who could utilize the information, he's not the only one who gets to benefit from it now. There's still always a downside.    

But I'm getting away from the point. I've been hiding out, miles from civilization, for about eight months now. I've kept myself entertained with recordings from my life that I transferred over to cassette. I've eaten nothing but rice and beans for the past six weeks, according to my notes, and I'm running out of those. I'm tired of this. Maybe I'm weak, but I was never a doomsday prepper, and I can't stand this isolation. Plus, I understand that this can't last forever. They'll find me eventually. I know that the moment I leave for supplies, I'll be jumped. They won't just kill me, either; that would be too easy. And besides, I'm no use to them dead. My particular flavor of pure, unadulterated *understanding* of the world could open up so many opportunities for wish redistribution if the wrong people had access to it.    

And they know what I have, of course. Some other rich bastard with more money than empathy was stupid and did the whole "infinite knowledge" wish years ago. That's how they keep tabs on who knows about the wishes in the first place. Most of those people were his friends and peers, people he expected to know. When my name popped up on his radar and he figured out I was just some *poor* with no resources to use this curse--excuse me, *ability*\--with, though, he saw what he could gain from it.     

I won't let them get me, though.    

I decided to tell you all of this for a reason. I know that telling you this--explaining the monkey's paw and all--won't count as real knowledge on your part. I'm posting it on *Reddit*, for fuck's sake. I could be making this shit up for upvotes, so there's no reason that it'll register as you actually *knowing* anything. You won't end up on his radar like I did, staring at a plate of moldy rice and wondering how you got to this point. But I figured you all deserved to know before the world ends or whatever is going to happen in about twelve hours.    

See, I turn 26 in exactly twelve hours. And since I know everything, or pretty close to it, at least, I know what my chances are of my next wish being granted if I make it then. I won't give you the number, but just know there's a *much* higher chance of it succeeding than failing.     

I'm going to wish for this to stop.    

Now, since my knowledge does have *some* limits--again, I asked for understanding, not knowledge itself--I don't know how, exactly, my wish is going to be granted. But I can calculate what the most likely results are based on my understanding of the process. This could be how I die and the whole reason the wish gets granted in the first place, though I doubt that since it would probably fall under the "self-inflicted" category. Maybe my hunters will just forget I exist, but I'll be forgotten by everyone else as a consequence. It would be a poetic, if unlikely, end for someone who can't remember my best friend's name most days.    

But, by my calculations, the most likely result is that *everything* will stop. The Wish-Granter tends to be literal, after all, and if I specify that I don't want my wish to affect anyone else, well ... It certainly likes that Paw Patrol wrapping paper. But if that happens, it means that the death, the disease, the wars ... they'll all be over, too. Everything will end, but everything will be at peace.    

If, by some chance, my wish fails or, less likely, the Wish-Granter decides *not* to end the whole world because of my selfishness, well, then take all of this as a warning.    

Be careful what you wish for.    

It just might come true.
