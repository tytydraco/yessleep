This is part two. You can find part one here: [Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hxz9es/something_that_happened_to_me_in_early_november/)

I found myself in the hallway in front of my apartment. There were certain flashbacks, red lights, the cemetery. Chanting. The feeling that I am not entirely myself, I must have slipped out of consciousness. The night after my encounter, I was unable to find sleep. I must have been. Many of you might not be directly familiar with esoteric dealings, but many of those who are into the dark arts are, I want not say squeamish, but have a very healthy respect. 

I needed to find out what happened the night before. I felt like I was running a light fever, and my stomach felt raw on the inside. My eyes were burning, like they were melting out of my skull, and my temples felt like someone had beaten me with a hammer. I guessed the headache was mostly because of the lack of sleep. Had I had alcohol? Did I talk to anyone? This felt like the worst hangover of my life.

My apartment is small and consists of a very small hallway, my tiny bathroom and my bedroom/living room/kitchen with a kitchenette, a desk which also functions as a dining table and two bookshelves. I am normally a tidy person, but when I opened the door this morning I found myself in front of a sea of clothes, basically, everything I had was thrown on the floor. The smell was nauseating. It was strange to come back to my place like this. Thinking for one moment someone might have broken in, I checked the window and the door, but both seemed untouched. It was next to impossible to tell if anything was missing in the mess. I had a diary, one could call it a grimoire, but it might also have been among the stuff. I only had one set of keys, the only other person having a spare was my landlord. 

For one moment I was thinking whether I should retrace my steps.

This phrase ran through my mind. Speak the name of power. I decided to ignore this for now. I took the three steps into my bathroom, grabbed three ibuprofen, put two in my pocket, and swallowed the third with some water from the faucet. It was time to go grab some coffee, I could not be inside my apartment now. The place smelled too much like garbage.

I walked two blocks to the bus stop, where there was a small Turkish cafe. I needed to collect myself and calm my nerves. I walked in and the owner Burak greeted me. My habit was to have my coffee with a cardamom pod in the cup. I took my wallet out of my pocket and put it on the counter in front of me. 

“You look like shit”, he is blunt like that, of course, it must be true. I hope I don’t smell like garbage. When I ask for a cup of coffee, he tells me that there is none left. I look at him, trying to understand, when he laughs out, “Your friend had it all”. ”What do you mean?”, I ask, as I follow his glance. In the far corner, there she was. He smiles, but this smile is not warm, it looks menacing, like a grimace. I nod, as he turns around, breaks a cardamom pod, and pours me some coffee. She was sitting there, reading a comically large and apparently leather-bound book. This was, unmistakably, the girl from last night.

I did not dare to look at her too long and looked right back at Burak. He looked back at me and visibly forced a smile, giving his face a grotesque look, just to quickly avert his glance from me. As if he doesn’t stand my sight. I notice at this point that I still smell awful, like something is far rotten, for a long time. The fact that she was here could not be a coincidence, and it felt so wrong. My stomach felt like a knot, and my throat was just a big lump in my neck at this point. Fight or Flight, and for me, it was clear, that I had to get out of this place, I turned around and heard Burak say something sheepishly, but I could not turn around. I felt like prey.

I walked in the opposite direction away from my thrashed apartment, apart from trying to get away from her, I had no idea, where I was going. In fact, I must have been heading toward the university. I was walking as fast as I could without running and turned around. There was no sight of her, or Burak, or anybody else for that matter, nevertheless, I began running.

I ran for several blocks, breathing heavily and feeling my burning lungs after only a few steps. I tasted blood in my mouth, my feet felt like they would tear every time my shoes hit the ground. 

Eventually, I turned into a small side street and patted myself down. My wallet must have still been in Burak’s café, or I lost it while running for who knows how long. I stood trying to catch my breath for a few seconds and then began walking down the street quickly, my head dizzy and the terrible headache I had in my apartment earlier coming back with a vengeance.

I stood in a little arch, yielding to an inner yard, and tried to catch my breath. In the window on the other side of the street, I saw the head of a girl with a horrified look on her face. 

Mordeshu.

She did not look away immediately after I looked back at her but then was gone quickly. I stared at the window for a moment and realized that my reflection was pale, my hair completely messed up. I must have looked like a deranged homeless person. I looked down at my hands and with the intense smell of rot in my nose, and the hammering inside my skull, I noticed how diseased my hands looked. My fingers were bony as if the skin was old and about to fall off, completely pale. On my left middle finger, the skin around the fingernail was retracting in a way I had never seen before as if it was tightening and couldn’t hold on to the nail. I touched my fingernail and felt intense pain, as it came off as easily as plucking an overripe berry from a straw. 

Further down, I saw that there were two red puddles around my shoes on the pavement, where I was standing. Blood was leaking out of my shoes. My body gave in at this point and I collapsed onto the ground, with a last glimpse I saw how the door of the house on the other side of the street opened.
