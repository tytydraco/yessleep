I work for the Bank Of Souls; though you would probably never know it by that name unless you had the money. The average person will never hear it called that in their lifetime, but in reality; it is one of the biggest financial institutions in the USA. Normal people walk in here by the thousands each day to complete their day to day banking transactions and nobody bats an eye. 

Confused? Well, let me lay everything out for you. Just a fair warning though, it is a LOT to take in. Everything I've written is 100% true. Any names or real identifying information within this story have been removed for my own safety. 

15 years ago I graduated from university with a Bachelor's Of Commerce Degree. I was still young at the time and after graduation I had no real direction in life. After all it was my parents that chose this career path for me. I wanted to be a musician.. but that just wouldn't fly in our family. I handed out resumes to basically any open position relating to finance I could find just hoping to land a job. With bills and student debt weighing on me heavily I was pretty well desperate for any work at all. But with this being a huge city and me being so young still, I was turned down for basically everything I had applied to.

Except for one. I was invited for an interview at the largest bank in the city for a Teller position. It wouldn't have been a great use of my degree to stay in the role forever, but like I said I was desperate, and they had placed a great degree of emphasis on “moving up the ladder” within the company. So, I accepted the interview offer. And after a very intense meeting with my future manager, I was relieved to find that they chose me for the position. 

I spent 3 years as a teller before moving up to Branch Manager, where I spent another 3 years before accepting a position as Regional Manager. Upon reaching year 10 in my career at the bank, I was approached by the Vice President and a few other powerful heads of the institution to discuss a “new opportunity” for me. 

Before talks were even underway I was handed an NDA to sign, stating that even if I were not to accept the position, I was not allowed to discuss the contents of our meeting that day with absolutely anybody. Not all too uncommon for safety sensitive positions so I signed it without a second thought, and was brought to a boardroom to converse about this new role. 

That's where I learned about the proverbial “Dark Side of The Moon” that this financial institution had. “The Bank Of Souls” as the VP called it. Similar to how you can rent a safety deposit box or lockbox at the bank to store valuable items, you can also store your soul so it can be transplanted into a body of your choosing. 

Yes, you heard that right. Human souls DO in Fact actually exist, and you CAN extract them. That's where we come into play. Say you're 60 years old and dying of cancer or some other ailment. Some people make peace with the fact that death is natural, and some people's time on Earth is shorter than others. But on the other hand, there are some people who cannot make peace with the thought of dying. Those are the people we cater to. 

The technology for soul extraction and storage was first thought up and eventually created by the Founder of the Bank itself. Now on paper he's been dead since 1967, but in reality, he's been living under a different name in the body of a now 27 year old male down on the California coast. He's got a beautiful wife, 2 kids, and a lovely beach house right on oceanfront property. The absolute American Dream. 

The man was a genius, simply put. As well as being the founder of what would eventually become an absolute Titan of a company, he was obsessed with science and in particular; discovering, capturing and transplanting the human soul. Thought to be impossible for centuries, he proved them all wrong back in the 1940s, around the time the atomic bombs were being developed (which I later found out was just a front for this program, the bombs had been developed already by 1936).

 Having already acquired a mass amount of wealth at this point, the Founder funded all necessary research and recruited the top scientists in the country at the time to focus on the project until it was completed. Completion came in 1958 with the first human soul transplant becoming a success; the founder's own Mother, saved from the horrors of Cancer. 

Now I know you might have a million different questions, so let me attempt to answer some of the ones I feel would be most asked by giving you some more info on the process. 

A human soul can be extracted from the body forcefully, or as long as it is done within the first 2 hours of its passing. After the time period is up, the soul will naturally vacate. Where does it go if we don't extract and contain it? I don't know.. Heaven or Hell or something. It's not entirely clear but we do actually have teams working on finding out, believe it or not. Once the soul is successfully released into the new body, it takes about a week for it to fully implant, upon which you will finally awaken as your new self. Yeah, no, it doesn't happen instantly like in the movies and video games. It's actually quite the delicate process.

All of your memories of who you are remain within your soul, not in the human brain. So as such, a human soul can be transplanted into any vacant body without any major issue. As I mentioned briefly in the beginning, this process costs a FORTUNE, so only those with the means to do so are able to. In exchange for the hefty sum, you get to live again. But you must now create an entirely new life for yourself under a different name, and in a different part of the country or a new country all together. It would be mighty awkward if you assumed control of someone else's body, got spotted by a member of their family, and tried to play it off. It would also put this entire operation in jeopardy. There is a way we try to combat this and I will explain it last, as I know it will be controversial.

If you wish to regain your earthly possessions you must figure out a plan for them before your old body dies. Your finances, however, can be handled and eventually transferred over to you in your new life providing you sign another contract with us. I mean we are still a bank after all… just operating with a greater level of secrecy or discretion in this case. 

And lastly, some of you may be wondering how we get bodies.

While I'd like to say most are sourced sustainably from morgues or similar places, it in fact only makes up a small percentage of our total inventory of bodies. Most bodies from morgues are of no use to us. Organ failures, car crashes, suicides, murder victims. Most of the bodies are mutilated or otherwise unusable in some way.

The most sustainable way we keep up our inventory is to “acquire” people. 

Each year in the USA between 1.6 million to 2.8 million youths run away from home. Their ages vary but they can be anywhere between 10-20 years old. This is the perfect age range for the process, as nobody really wants to start over again any *older* than that.

While the majority percentage of those youths are often eventually found, returned home, or go on to lead successful lives of their own; we are responsible for almost the ENTIRETY of the final percentage which is Missing Youths. We determine which of them come from the most broken homes, the ones without any real family, the ones that have been abandoned, and we take them to our facility for a full medical screening.

Those who pass the medical screening end up as inventory. Empty vessels to be used by the rich and powerful for their own purposes later on. Those who do not pass, are “taken care of”. It would be too much of a risk to release them back onto the streets again, even if the probability of nothing bad happening is extremely low. 

I realize that the moral implications of such a thing are astounding. I realize that what I've described sounds absolutely horrible and I should be ashamed for taking part in it. But at this point it's just second nature for me. This is my life, and besides that, this is also the highest paying job I've ever had in my life. So high in fact, I was able to purchase a body for myself. I haven't quite decided on where I'd like to go after this body dies, but I'm thinking somewhere… tropical. 

So the next time you're thinking about death just remember: There is an Afterlife, but only if you're willing to pay for it.
