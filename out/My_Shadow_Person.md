It's been many years since but what it said to me continues to grow more true as I age, no matter what I do I can't forget. I've become integrated with it's words.

I'll say I'm a very open minded person, so I don't easily follow what others say or do without giving it a lot of contemplation.

My brother had passed away nearly 13 years ago now, and 12 years ago I went through a mental break down. His presence being gone plus years of childhood trauma, I hit rock bottom. In this state I decided I didn't want to live anymore, life became too painful. I just wanted to know why life on earth is this way, I know it couldn't be changed but just why?

I begun researching religions to find meaning, building links between each one and trying to process which might be closer to the "truth". The truth to me is one that isn't built on bias views or benefits but makes everything connected, make sense. I prayed to whatever god is if he existed, i didn't have a clear image in mind. He/She/It,/Energy/The universe, i wasn't sure.  I'm not religious, but at the time i was willing to try anything if it meant finding this truth.

One day I'm reading through the bible and i come across a passage that mentioned when people wanted to talk to god, they talked to the sky. Cried out to it. In my desperateness, that's exactly what I did. Nothing was off the table anymore, i didn't care about the consequences or what people thought. 

I went into my backyard and went on my knees, i looked up and spoke to the sky. Most of it was crying and asking why humans exist to suffer as so, i don't ask for time to be reversed because i know it can't be but just to be told why it exists as so. I poured my heart out.

As night came I did one last pray, one last attempt and asked to show me the truth in my dreams. I felt i was being reasonable to the laws governing our universe and not asking to appear in front of me but at least a dream. The dream i got, not one but many.

The first night it appeared, it wasn't a dream but sleep paralysis. I laid in bed unable to move, in the same position i had laid in to fall asleep. Near the wall, the shadow leaned against it. If i had to describe what i mean by shadow, i don't mean just blackness. It's like looking at water that's moving and it's so dark, looking at it is similar to seeing through your peripheral vision. I couldn't move for a minute and afterwards i could and jumped up. Nothing is there and i told my mom what happened which she agreed is creepy.

I spent the past months feeling dead inside and this new event caused me to feel a sense of liveliness, purpose. I had to see if this event is related to my prays, so again that night i prayed for wisdom and truth. I stated i didn't care what happened to me, or if it shortened my life to know some grand truth, i would offer my time on earth.

Night came again and sleep paralysis happened just as before, the shadow stood against the wall. He talked but i couldn't understand what he said. For whatever reason my mind couldn't comprehend it, it didn't sound like any language i heard before and it sounded as 3 voices speaking at once. This time i didn't jump up after it ended, i woke up in morning feeling slightly disoriented. I knew one thing though, he talked to me for an hour but i can't remember any of it nor do i remember anything said. All i knew is that one fact.

Before i continue i will say that me putting this story out there is going against my better judgement. I feel it's dangerous and anyone can meet this shadow if they find the right method as I did, so i'll have to leave a key few details out. You'll understand why as i continue.

The sleep paralysis stopped after 2 more nights and became dreams. I didn't see him at the beginning dreams but i knew he was creating my dreams, these dreams were the most intense and filled with hidden meanings. I woke up from each feeling like i just spent hours studying and my brain was tired.

I won't go full detail or mention every dream here and just mention certain parts I remember most at the beginning dreams. The numbers aren't in order or per night.

1. I laid in the backseat of a car as my mom drove and i asked my mom why life went this way, looking up to see a hole in the sky with a ufo passing by.

2. I stood at what appeared to be docks that was also the edge of a mountain and looked up to the sky. A hole to seeing space and ufo passing by as the previous dream. A man walked up behind me, wearing a white robe, having a large white beard touched my shoulder and said "You're hurting aren't you? Suffering is 6106". After speaking those words a lot of emotions deep down came pouring out as i screamed from it's release and woke up crying. 

After waking up i felt lighter, and the anger and sadness i had been holding down went away and i went to my mom to tell her how good i felt and the dream. She told me it sounded creepy but she was just happy to see me happy, at the time she knew i was going through suicidal thoughts.

However, this feeling didn't last long and one thing i noticed but didn't think much of started. Each time i woke up, my closet door would be open. I never kept it open before sleeping and made sure to close it each night. I didn't bother me at the time because i thought maybe i forgot to close it,. Fast forward 2 weeks and the dreams kept coming, but they changed.

The night before the change to a different type of dreaming i had sleep paralysis which i hadn't had in a long time and the shadow person stood near the wall. His voice sounding like 3 voices speaking at once but this time i could understand him. I didn't understand the language but his voice was in my head and made sense. He told me (I say he because i heard a male sounded voice but before i could understand the voice, it didn't have a gender like sound and it didn't have any figure showing a gender) he could show me the truth but i might come to regret it and once i know i can't unknow it. I woke up to a normal morning and that day i took a lot of time to think and i wanted the truth more than anything so before sleeping i said outloud i need to know the truth.

I can't remember each dream, but i can say for sure it was every night and felt like 15-30 minutes of real time, i'll say a few i remember and certain parts. When i mention the words spoken, they're not exact wording but close to what i can remember. I started having insomnia along with large amounts of stress due to the dreams , so i woke up stressed out so my memory became a bit foggy.

1. I'm on a planet that's not earth and everything moves differently. I saw a single tree that resembled a maple tree, but the way it moved is like nothing i ever saw before. Growing on it was an apple, i grabbed it and examined it. The apple was like crystal, not see through entirely where you can see the ground but i could see some parts of the inside. The color is closer to red but not completely. Imagine red if it was the color of a rainbow, multiple colors at once but it wasn't anything more than red. I don't know how to describe it and again, i had never seen this color nor type of crystal before. I heard his voice in my head say "You see this apple. Humans have never seen this, if you try to explain this to someone. They wouldn't be able to comprehend it. They'll use past experiences to envision what you're describing and it won't be what you see because they didn't see it themselves. The reason humanity has reached it's current state it because they have no communication that is true. So as time goes, the knowledge passed on through generations becomes tainted, losing it's pureness. Ultimately becoming a lie, a truth that is tainted is a lie. There will never be understanding between humans."

My thoughts, what i saw in that dream to this day is the most beautiful imagery i have ever seen. No movie, show, or real life color or object can even compare. What he said stuck with me and i believe that to be part of the "truth" to humanities existence, however that is my point of view and i'm not here to convince anyone otherwise.

At this time of dreams, i had noticed the closet door being open on waking and i started to feel creeped out and put 25 pound weights in front of the door. I told my mom to never open it because i was having nightmares and it meant a lot to me that she didn't touch my closet. Of course.. upon waking the door was open half way with the weight slightly moved just in front. There is no logical reason for someone to open a door half way and even if they forgot to close it, they would of moved the weight completely to pass through and there's no reason it to put it back half way with the weight also half way even if anyone did move it which i know, nobody did. Continuing.

2. I was in a dark place, pitch black. I stood on a path what appeared to be similar to a sidewalk but it seemed like cobblestone rather than the usual sidewalk. A blue flame lit on each side of this walk way and it being the only light available as beyond the walk way is pitch black darkness, an infinitely large never ending void. People were walking in groups as there is many walkways connecting to one another and some leading to 2 doors, slightly brownish doors. I can't say if it was wooden or metal, just brownish. nothing holding them to stand, pitch black on each side of the door. Leading these groups of people were large creatures. The group of people and creature wore white robes, the people looked average, nothing unusual. Men and women, no kids. The creatures besides being large, had their face covered by small white sheets. I asked outloud "Where is this place, who are those people?". The shadow answered back "Those are the enlightened ones, that's what they call themselves. They sought truth through various means including meditation and were tricked by demons and now those demons are leading them to eat their souls." After he said that i remember walking into the doors so i can see what happens to the group of people and the big creature turned to the group of people.. then i woke up.

Yeah, the closet door again is open after waking. At this point i just felt creeped out by it and closed it. I started to lose sleep, i wasn't sure i wanted to know anything else. By this point i had more dreams but i think i started blocking them from my memory and sometimes i just didn't remember on waking, only knowing i had one and the shadow talked and talked in each. As for the dream, i took it as the shadow warning me that knowledge comes with a price. Not every road will lead to it and people will be tricked by other beings. As for word usage like demons, enlightened ones, i'm not sure. I won't say it's from religious ways because if i learned one thing, is humans don't have all the answers and some words we use today don't really hold any meaning because it depends on perspective rather than it being it's original intended usage upon creation.

Some context: I had a dream a few times from my childhood up to my teen years of a woman with long black hair being in a dark corner of my room, her hair wavy and very long black.

3. I have sleep paralysis, however i'm still dreaming. I'm going to say the color of the room is dark greenish for some reason. So l'm on the couch laying down paralyzed, and i see the woman with long black hair in the corner of my ceiling, her skin pale but dark. Parts of her skin are is peeling off and beneath it is just more dark spots. I can't remember exactly what the shadow said this time, the stress had been building so my memory became more foggy. Even typing all this now i feel a tired stress, i haven't thought about this stuff in a while. He did talk to me and acknowledge it's a ghost and has been following me for a long time now, i woke up.

I think i started to have mix feelings about the shadow, like he knew everything there is to know. When around him i didn't have fear of the unknown, he felt like a mentor to me. Up to now some of what he's said is part of me, i say humans a lot. I'm aware it's a sign of disconnection but i also don't think it's wrong. I was born a human but it doesn't mean i have to be in the same bubble as them or associate to the words, definitions, lifestyle etc. My thoughts had become "Humans are flawed beings going in circles", as the shadows words slowly became my own. While i had some fear of the shadow and his intentions, i also felt a sense of safety. In a way, the ghosts or whatever else is out there didn't cause me to have fear anymore, neither did the thought of death. I know i'm rambling here and this isn't to say i know the truth because to each their own but rather to show the impact the shadow had on my personality and thinking as a whole. I still believe and think in that way but i've just pulled back more on it, i mean not like i can exactly tell this story and expect people to see me as mentally sane and instantly agree to my views when they were raised to think the way society taught them to. Anyways, moving on.

By now 2 months had passed. I had insomnia which i never had before in my life, and i didn't want to sleep at night. i waited until the sun rose and asked my mom to keep checking the door to make sure it's closed while i slept and she knew it was important because i started telling her what was happening. Each time i woke, the door was open and she sweared nobody touched it and had fear on her face of what was happening. Now the next dream, this is the 2nd to last dream.

4. I'm inside my room but everything is upside down, there's a ladder on the ceiling, but being upside down the ceiling is the floor. I climbed up and now things were not upside but but the left and right of my room were still opposite of each other which seemed normal for a dream. Everything felt like a dark green and i saw the shadow person sitting on the floor, legs crossed. However he wasn't a shadow person anymore, he had a human like figure but his presence couldn't be mistaken. I knew it was him. Male body, looked to be in shape, pale skin, bald, red symbols/marking on his head, he appeared to be meditating. I can't remember what he said.. i remember he opened his eyes and spoke to me and it was very important. Involving the near future, something having to do with fire, buildings and explosions everywhere and something about a country. For the life of me i can't remember but i know it was important, probably the most important thing he ever told me.

  
The closet door was open and by now i was using 2 25 pound weights, at this point i was just testing and seeing what could work, mom couldnt explain it and said stuff like "I just checked 30 mins ago and it was closed", i stopped bringing it up, she was becoming scared.

  
I'm getting tired here so i'm going to fastball some dream summaries here and i don't remember the time line so i can't place it exactly somewhere specific but around this shadow person event for sure.

Dream 1: I fell asleep, saw pitch black with numbers and letters appearing and a voice saying "Were here". I spent the entire day looking this up and after hours i found out space has coordinates and it was in a part filled with lots of suns. I don't remember or letters or numbers today and yeah that bothers me.

Dream 2: I stood on a road and a bright light opened up in the sky and a voice said along the lines of "The great suffering for humanity to come", then a scroll floated to me and i opened it. It was 3 pages, looked like old parchment which ive only ever seen in movies or games, and said along the lines of the dead rising sometime in the near future, demons and humanity will become one to fight against this threat.

These were similar to my beginning dreams, shadow person wasn't so much involved but it related to the events happening and felt significant in some way but i couldn't explain or figure it out.

Were finally here, the last dream. This dream gave me chills, enough so that after waking i stopped asking for knowledge and prayed to whatever god that i didn't want to have these dreams anymore and i just want to go back to having a normal life. At this point, the shadow person wasn't a shadow anymore. Instead he would take different forms and use the look of passed away family members. I think it was his way of trying to comfort me by coming in a familiar form however it came off unsettling and one thing i'll never forget long as i live, and i've never felt this feeling in my entire life. His eyes.. His eyes were wide and he never took them off yours, they felt piercing and like he understood my entire existence. When he looked at me i felt like there isnt a single thing he doesn't know about me or humans and i couldn't hide anything from him. He knew it all and his smile too, creepy. His smile never felt warming but eerie. Upon writing this i remembered a dream so random bonus dream.

Dream 3:  *I went to the restroom and he came out of the shower with those piercing eyes, wide smile. He went on a rant, it didnt feel like a lesson or teaching. He just sort of ranted about humans being undeserving to be in the light and how they didn't deserve it. He looked down on humans and didn't believe they deserved any sympathy and that their suffering is from their own mistakes.* 

*I'll be honest here, looking back at humanities history and still on going conflicts and what humans do to one another, i don't completely disagree with him. Not all humans are that way but a good majority are selfish. Look at the people with power, fame, and social media influencers. Maybe his way of thinking just stuck on me, i can't say i encourage this type of thinking, i would feel too disconnected from life if i did and after the next dream you might understand why i try to forget now.*

*Last dream:*  I was in a classroom, randomly. It wasn't a man but a woman wearing school clothes. However by the piercing eyes and big never ending smile, it's the shadow. She started to tell me that demons have 3 hearts and where they're located on the body. One being in the middle of the chest, the left side chest and one below the middle near the stomach.  Skipping a big chunk of the dream because i don't remember what else she said, she talked for 20 mins or so. My mind is blank to it. I'm inside my room and it's morning. I'm in front of my closet where the door is halfway open, it didn't feel like a dream but i knew it still was. Within the darkness of the closet the voice, not a man or womans but the original i first heard. 3 voices at once and inside my head came out. It said "If you ever want the truth, just step into the darkness You know where to find me, i'll always be waiting here and you'll be able to see through anyone just by glancing at them, knowing everything they feel and think. " The closet door closed slowly and i woke up.

The closet door was open and i ran to turn on the light and close it. I had the chills, fear. After that dream i never dreamt of the shadow person again, nor did my closet door ever open. Time passes but i feel it's presence still there watching, waiting for the moment i decide i want to know more.  I believe 100% i could call to it and set up cameras and a crew of people to watch me sleep and they would see the door open and everything.

Personal thoughts: I believe the shadow person has goals and giving knowledge in exchange is nothing to it. It's looking for a person who has certain qualities i won't mention as i stated at the beginning. These certain qualities will allow a person to link to it and i think this shadow person has sinister goals that will impact humanity as a whole. 

For this post i allowed myself to drift back into the thoughts i used to have to show a small bit of how i used to be, i'm not like that anymore. It's still there and it feels apart of me, thoughts in the back of my mind but i try to be more sociable and live a normal life mostly. I have a gf, i don't call people humans anymore, and i don't care for an ultimate knowledge. 

If you're thinking.. If i go into a closet that's dark and ask it to come back, it will. If anyone has questions feel free to ask but if this doesn't get attention, maybe thats for the best. I have a theory whenever i mention the shadow person, bad things seem to happen around me. So this is my last time mentioning him until my last breath. Just wanted to share an experience that science, or others might not believe or gone through. believe me or not ofc.

Came back to add, I keep my closet closed off with weights now. It's become a normal part of my life.
