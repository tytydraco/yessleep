For those who don’t know, BeReal is an app that makes you take a picture once a day at a random time. Friends can react to your BeReal once you post them, and even message you too. The picture I took didn’t seem out of the ordinary. However, my friend Jacob sent me a message through BeReal. 

OptimusnonPrime13 reacted to your BeReal: (Shocked Realmoji)

OptimusnonPrime13 commented on your BeReal: Wow Isaac! Just wondering, who is that in the background? In the window? Or am I just seeing things?

Jacob was right, someone's face was pressed up against the window. I immediately looked up to where the window was, but nobody was there. The quality of the BeReal couldn’t quite highlight the details of the mysterious face in the window, but you could tell that the face was pale, and something was not right about it. 

I looked more outside the window, and there were footprints within the snow leading from into, and out of the yard. Someone had been stalking me, so the obvious choice was to call the police. 

I was freaked out, and slightly terrified. When the police arrived, they found nothing, no traces of anyone anywhere, and the footprints only lead to the road, where there was no snow.
All they could do was file a report for a trespasser, and after that, they left. The ring cameras didn’t catch anyone, as my window was near a blindspot. That night, I locked myself in my house and tried to get some sleep, but I barely got any. 

The next morning, my story about my stalker was overshadowed due to the fact a girl in my grade shot herself. Her name was Samantha, and news of her death quickly spread. Samantha was bullied frequently because of her weight, and I guess she didn’t want to deal with that. However, I wouldn’t know for sure because I’d never be caught dead with Samantha.

We even made an instagram account just to make fun of her. I realized that the fan account wouldn’t get anymore videos of her anymore, which was quite saddening. However, I was wrong. My friend Jacob snuck inside of Samantha’s funeral, and took his BeReal there. An absolute chad. He even titled the BeReal: ‘Samantha’s funeral was really breathtaking’. Everyone reacted to it with laughing Realmojis, including me.

Quick Note: Samantha’s body was found in the river, after she had killed herself with a shotgun. Although the body couldn’t be recognized, the autopsy suggests that they were matching DNA results. Her family seems to have an abnormal grieving pattern, especially in her brother. People have reported Samantha’s brother making violent remarks about harming other people, especially after his sister’s death.

Jacob’s next BeReal seemed normal at first. Jacob had been left to live in the house as his parents were on a business trip. For any peculiar reason, Jacob’s younger sister, Pam, was hiding underneath the bed. Her long, black strands of hair lead from underneath the bed. Something felt wrong about Jacob. It came to my realization that Jacob didn’t have a sister anymore. Pam passed away from Leukemia last year. 

Somebody else was in his house. Tell Jacob to leave immediately. Call the police. 

The police were too late. The police found his body. Jacob’s BeReal was his last photo. Jacob was found with his entire head smashed into a pulp. Crimson color caked the surfaces of his carpet and walls. They simply stated that he was murdered, but not quite how. I only found out because in school, Jacob's girlfriend discovered someone had taken her phone, and took the picture of Jacob’s body. It gets even more strange. Jacob’s phone couldn’t be found. 

Jacob’s death came after poor, fat Samantha. Since Jacob was literally ambushed and murdered by something, school was put into a safety lockdown for a week. Part of me couldn’t believe that Jacob had truly died. Especially in the way that he did. Such a violent, brutal way to die. Part of me knew that the stalker had involvement with Jacob, and even fat Samantha. 

I made sure all the doors, and windows were locked. Something terrifying was out there. I just sat in, scrolling through my phone, until BeReal notified me that it was time to take another photo. The BeReal I took was really dark, and you couldn’t make out a thing. As my BeReal was loading on the page, I noticed my other friends had posted too. My friend Veronica showed up first. Slowly, all my friends began to upload their BeReals.

OptimusnonPrime13 was Jacob, and somehow he or someone posted a BeReal. That wasn’t even the worst part. [It was a picture of a dark room](https://imgur.com/7Jzg90u), and in the center of the photo was a white artifact highlighting someone's face. Upon closer inspection on the screen, the white artifact was my face looking at the phone I was using. 

I forgot to put the house on home mode on the ring. I immediately shot up, and looked to where the picture should’ve been taken. It was taken from the door. Even in the complete darkness the man’s silhouette could be seen. I wanted to think that this was in my imagination. Unfortunately, it wasn’t. The figure began to move slightly.

I turned off my phone and quickly hid underneath the bed, using the darkness as a veil that the man couldn’t see through. He walked into the room, and turned on the light.  The man’s voice was like a thunderbolt in a storm.

“Do you know what you did, you piece of shit?”
	
I could see the man’s shoes shuffle on the carpet floor. With every step, panic inferred inside me.

“Are you in the closet?” 

The man created a loud noise, which I assumed was him hitting the closet, with some sort of object. While he was distracted, I was able to run out. When I reached the hallway, I found that the entrance was open. As soon as I was able to reach the entrance of the door, I heard a series of quick footsteps approaching behind me. 

“Where do you think you’re going, Isaac?”

I ran out of the house without looking back. Running outside, with no shoes and only socks was painful, but it was the last thing on my mind. The man stopped chasing me when I reached the main part of the road where there were many vehicles passing by. Eventually I was able to reach safety because I was able to hitch a ride with another car. 

The police are looking into the man who had tried to kill me. They haven’t caught him yet. I’ve been contacting people on my phone about what has been happening recently and documenting everything that has happened. What you’ve been reading is my perspective on what happened to me, and what I think happened to Jacob. I just heard, a while ago, my friend Veronica was mysteriously murdered in her car. Her phone couldn’t be found. She had died the same night I was attacked. I think I know what happened to Veronica.

This all happened a couple days ago. I just got a notification on my phone: It’s time to take your BeReal. None of my friends posted anything except Veronica, and Jacob. Their BeReals are all pictures of my other friends, taken from a dark angle.
