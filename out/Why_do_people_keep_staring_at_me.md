I need to know if this has been happening to anyone else because I don’t understand what’s going on and it’s freaking me out.

 

It started a few days ago. I was on the bus and out of the corner of my eye I could see the person a few seats across from me, and it looked like they were staring at me. I couldn’t tell for sure because they were just barely within the edge of my periphery. I thought maybe they were looking at something else. Looking past me, out the window or something. Could have been anything.

 

But I subtly turned my head towards them and... they weren’t looking at me. They had their head down looking at their phone. I figured I mistook my peripheral vision. Again, they just looked like a vague blob of color from where I could see, and they were blond, so maybe I mistook the hue of their skin for the hue of their hair? Things like that happen I guess. I forgot about it.

 

Then it happened again the next day. Different person, different seat, I could see them staring at me from the very edge of my vision. This time I was almost certain. They had long dark hair, and I could see that darkness on either side of the face shaped, light skin colored, fuzzy blob. Vague dark points within that shape denoting eyes, nose, and mouth. They were looking at me.

 

This time I turned my head fast to meet their gaze but, again, their head was down and they were on their phone. Their dark hair coming down and covering the side of their face. I couldn’t have mistaken it this time.

 

I was kind of freaked out by this point, but I chose to believe my eyes were playing tricks on me again. It was a long few days. I was in my head. Fine.

 

Then it happened again. This time in a restaurant. I could see them sitting in a booth parallel to my table. They were further away so I couldn’t make out specific details but I could see that their body was facing forward, and their head was turned and facing me.

 

I decided not to turn my head, just to turn my eyes towards them really fast. It was the quickest way to get even a portion of my focused vision on them. So I did, and then I saw it... The flick.

 

That’s what I call it. For a split second... less than a split second... I saw them looking at me. But my brain didn’t have enough time to process the image before they flicked to looking at the menu. I say ‘flicked’ because it was too fast. Too sudden. Like a glitch. A single frame of animation out of place. I don’t know if I would’ve even noticed it if I wasn’t looking for it.

 

The fourth time it was a woman in the elevator of my building. I knew her. Her name was Darcy. We’ve had conversations before. But here she was, staring at me out of the corner of my eye. Every floor. All the way up.

 

When we got to our floor, I turned my eyes really fast and saw the flick again. It was impossible. If her head really turned that fast, then her hair should have moved. I should see it bouncing, whooshing, then falling into place. Instead, it sat comfortably like it had always been there.

 

She looked at me looking at her and she smiled. Like nothing happened.

 

I started seeing them more and more. It began happening multiple times a day. I was so scared, and so paranoid, I wanted it to stop, but I also had to see the flick again. I had to see what they looked like when they were looking at me.

 

Sometimes I could see it, if I was fast enough, but I could never fully process the image. It was never there for long enough. I could never fully see them. My brain would try interpolating what they SHOULD look like, but for some reason it never matched. I had a feeling... just a feeling... that the faces that were looking at me weren’t these peoples’ actual faces.

 

I tried to trick it using reflections to see, but they still flicked away. I tried to take video, but it was the same. By the time the recording started, they had already flicked away.

 

The redheaded man with the beard was the worst. I saw him staring from down the sidewalk. When I turned to face him, his entire body was facing away from me. His head spun back into place in a fraction of a fraction of a second.

 

I don’t know what they are. I don’t know why this is happening to me. I think I noticed something I wasn’t supposed to notice. I think they always watch us, using the eyes of others. We’re just not supposed to catch them looking.

 

I caught them looking and now I see them everywhere. Everyone stares at me all the time. I thought isolation was the answer but then I caught the reflection in my mirror staring too. I am never alone. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to stop it. I don’t know what they want. If you think someone might be staring at you out of the corner of your eye, don’t look. Please, don’t look.
