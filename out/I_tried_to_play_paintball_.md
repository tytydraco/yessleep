Me and my best friends have been trying to find more fun things do. we got tired of going to craft breweries and bars. We began doing things like hiking, going to museums, movies, and we decided today was the day to try out paintball.

We found a really neat course that wasn’t terribly far away from the house and had some great reviews. 

We were greeted by a young man who appeared to probably be around seventeen or eighteen. He went over the rules and the we signed the waivers. 

We bought a box of paintballs to split up and got our guns and masks. I began to look around and notice how serious people took this sport. Many were wearing camo and had smoke grenades and guns that looked similar to real ones.

The rules to the paintball course were rather simple. If you get shot, raise your hands and walk out so other participants won’t shoot you. If the shot doesn’t splatter or makes a normal hit (like a bunch of dots on you,) you can still play. Also do the same if you no longer have ammo left in. 

We played several rounds and had a great time. It felt nice to take some shots on your friends. I even had to clean paint out of my hair. 

This place offered five or six different courses you could choose to play in. We found one that was in the woods. The rest had barrels, man made structures to play in. This one we were told was an interesting option.

The owner who designed it dug small trenches had a few wooden boards to hide behind. Other than that, all you had was some brush and trees to hide behind. 

Me and my buddies found a few other guys who agreed to play against us. So it would be a 5v5. We decided to go in first and get a few minutes to hide. 

We decided it would be best to separate so we had more area to possibly flank them if we seen them. Truthfully, we would have got our butts kicked if we didn’t. They had professional gear, walkie talkies, smoke grenades , paint grenades, and we were the noobs. 

We spread until I found a good area with some tall brush and a few trees. I looked around so I could have escape routes if things went south. 

I could barely hear the whistle blow to indicate the match. I tried to remain quiet and then I heard footsteps. 

I pointed towards the noise and released a couple shots. I heard some grunting. There wasn’t any way it could have been my friends based on the directions they went. I heard paintballs being shot on the opposite side of the field. 

Whoever I shot wasn’t following the rules and raising their hands and leaving. They turned back and I shot again. I couldn’t see the person great but I could make out they weren’t wearing a mask either. That’s concerning because you don’t want that paint in your eyes or mouth. They grunted again and got behind the tree. 

I tried to creep slowly to the tree to talk to whoever I hit. I heart a loud boom next to my ear. 

All the sudden I heard a loud scream of hatred. The man was charging towards me with a musket. 

It felt like everything was happening and in slow motion. The man was wearing a blue uniform. I fell backwards. I let out a scream as I watched his bayonet push towards me. I put my hands over my stomach as once he jerked his gun up. 

I felt dizzy but was able to get up and run. I look over my shoulder and see him pouring powder into his rifle. I see other men in uniform appearing from thin air. They’re all pointing in my direction and begin to lift their muskets toward me. I remember tripping and waking up. 

I woke up to see some first responders over me pouring water on me and making sure my head wasn’t busted open. They said I hit my head on a rock. Once I sat up, I pulled my shirt up and there was no wound. 

Everyone tried to tell me that I must have fell and passed out before the match even started. I almost believed them too. 

I got home and began googling history in the area. Today was the anniversary of a battle during the civil war. The spot I was in was where northern troops were hiding and hoping to sneak up on their enemy. 

I tried getting ahold of the owner but he also believes what everyone else thought. My ear still hasn’t quit ringing though.
