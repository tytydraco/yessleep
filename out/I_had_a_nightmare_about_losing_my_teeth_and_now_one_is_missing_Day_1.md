The nightmare was the same every time. Nothing but darkness in the room, while strapped to a dentist chair, the only light is a bright blinding spotlight over head. My body is strapped in tight and some metal contraption holds open my eyes and mouth, wider than they are physically meant to open. The darkness is filled with the sounds of shaky labored breathing, and the slow slaps of approaching footsteps coming from every direction. Fazing in an out of view, is a hideously mangled humanoid entity. Its eyes have no lids, its hair growing and falling out like paper from a printer. But the worst part about it, is it's smile. The sides of its mouth, stapled open in a forced grin and on the inside of its mouth are rows of teeth that jut out in all different directions, as if they never belonged there in the first place. By the time it makes it's way over to me, yellowish hands tap around the inside of my mouth and begin to clamp down a pair of rusty pliers tight around each tooth, yanking and ripping them out one by one.

I awoke, sweating and gasping for air as the twangy phone alarm vibrated on my night stand. It was 5am, about 2 hours before I needed to head out for work. I rubbed the sleep from my eyes, slumped out of my warm comforter and into the cool air of my dingey apartment bathroom. The light flickered on, with a faded florescent glow as I cranked the faucet fixture with a bit more force than the day before. The water sputtered and sprayed out in a wide gushing stream as if begging to be released from its metal pipe prison. I cupped a little in my hands and splashed myself awake. It was freezing cold, leaving my hands and face in a pink stained hue. I left the faucet running as I clumsily grabbed the toothbrush and toothpaste to engage in my least favorite activity. I shuddered as a vision of the mangled monster replayed in my mind. Brushing away at my teeth, I felt a strange sensation in the back lower row of my mouth. I spat out the minty paste, seeing pink and red foam race down the drain. I peered into the water stained mirror and opened my mouth to see what could be going on. I thought it could have been a left over popcorn kernel from the movie date I went on with my new girlfriend, Avery, but it was much worse. At the back of my mouth, there was a dark red hole where one of my molars should have been.

"What the fuck???" I shouted, as I pulled out my cheek to make sure it wasn't a trick of the light.

Startled and incredibly disturbed, I rushed back into my room to see if the tooth had fallen out onto my sheets. I tossed every pillow, every blanket, threw off the fitted sheets in a panic, lifted the mattress, but found nothing. I had always had good hygiene and never needed braces or anything, never even had a cavity before. I was the guy that people got jealous of when I would say I never had issues with my teeth. I decided I would call my dentist later and tell them what happened. Hopefully they would have a more logical explanation than the one my mind kept telling me. I tried to relax, go on my morning run and head to work like normal.

As I sat at my office desk staring at the empty excel spread sheet, my tongue kept gliding over the small hole in the back of my mouth. I toyed and flicked at the space, wondering if maybe it was a baby tooth that had never fallen out till now. But since I was in my late twenties, the possibility of that was pretty unlikely. I felt something tap against the back of my head and swiveled around to see Stacy, my office-mate, chucking crumpled paper balls at me.

"Hey stinky, wake up! You're spacing out more than a grampa on the freeway. You ok?" She huffed, her body flopped over the back of her chair like a discarded coat. She was a bubbly southern girl, with large brown doe eyes, a cute round face, crunchy curls, and a baby blue button up dress. She was a little obnoxious but had a good heart. I stared at her while rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly.

"Sorry, I had a weird-ass dream last night and didn't get much sleep." I picked up one of the pens on my desk and clicked it in and out a couple times, hoping the sounds would soothe the uneasiness I felt. It was unsuccessful. I sighed and figured talking about the issue might help.

"Stacy, have you ever had a dream that happened over and over again? Or a dream that .. became reality?" I asked, still fidgeting with the pen on my desk. She paused, looking at me with a straight face and for a moment I thought she was going to be serious for once. Then that mischievous grin took over and I resisted the urge to roll my eyes.

"Actually, I used to have a reoccurring dream about my ass catching on fire. Then one day me and my cousins went out to the farm and tried making a genuine Texass methane booty torch out of peach perfume and a lighter. It back fired on me after rippin' a fat one, and now she's hot pinky down there. Does that count?" She busted out in wheezy giggles, as if she had told the joke of the century. Toilet humor was her strong suite, so part of me was not surprised.

"Ugh, remind me to never bring up deep topics with you ever again. Just forget I said anything," I chuckled and turned back to my monitor. The low hum of the computer began to whir and screech at me as I stared into the endless void of empty squares. They began to converge in my mind, creating a never ending rectangular spiral of black and white portals to nowhere. I couldn't focus on anything except that damn space in my gums. I leaned back in my chair and let out a hefty grunt. Stacy jumped in her seat and spun around quick.

"Alright mister, what's goin' on? You're huffin' and puffin' like jigsaw at a hunter's convention. It's been 4 hours and you still don't have the spread sheet layout done!" She whined as she scooted her chair up next to mine.

"I don't know I'm just not feeling good, plus you would just make a joke out of it or say something like; mah grand pappy went through that once, now he got gold teeth worth more than my right kidney." I said in my worst southern drawl.

"Hey! I don't sound like that!" she glared at me and gripped her arm rests tightly.

"Haha sorry." I hesitated, debating on whether or not to tell her about the nightmares. She looked at me with her large puppy eyes, and I caved.

"Look, I just ... I have this dream that happens on occasion where a creepy looking man ... or monster starts pulling my teeth out. It freaks me out a bit and it happened last night so I'm a little on edge right now. What's worse is I actually ... woke up with one of my molars missing. Not sure how that happened. " I paused and looked at Stacy through my overgrown bangs and waited for her to make another joke.

To my surprise, she didn't.

"Let me see." She said in a serious tone. I was taken aback but agreed and opened my mouth. Her eyes widened and she raised her eyebrow at me.

"And here I thought you were mister perfect pretty boy. Did you call your dentist?"

"Yeah but they can't see me till Friday, so hopefully the hole heals up and I can get an implant or something. But it's just weird. I've never had any issues with my teeth my entire life till today." I looked down and noticed I had been picking at the skin around my nails. Blood was oozing out of the freshly picked wounds, spotting up my pants in the process.

"Jesus, Jamie your hands! Let me go get you a band aid. Don't you move a muscle till I get back." She barked at me as she hopped up from her task chair and out the office door. The sound of her boots clopped down the hallway like a race horse. I froze, staring down at the small streams of blood beading out from the skin around my thumbs. A couple minutes later she returned, her curls now a mess and sweat stains on the front of her dress. She didn't have to run for such a small amount of blood.

"Give me your hand, big boy." She teased and grabbed at my wrist to apply disinfectant and a my-little-pony band-aid. Kiesha, our front desk rep, went out and bought them thinking it would be hilarious to see people in the office sporting MLP band-aids anytime someone managed to hurt themselves. After Stacy was done, she heaved a sigh and sat back in her chair.

For the rest of the day, Stacy kept an eye on me, which made me more stressed out about the situation than if she had just let it be. As 4pm slowly approached, part of me began to dread the idea of going back home and closing my eyes that night. That horrific mangled face, ripping away at my mouth with red crusted pliers, and manic unblinking eyes, the image was burned into my mind and refused to dissipate. The pounding of my heart reached my ears, as my breath quickened and for a moment the panic overtook any logic or means of rationality. A quick stir caused me to snap back to my seat as Stacy packed up her things to leave for the day.

4pm had arrived, and my lungs sank into my spine.

"Alrighty, well it's time! Jamie, are you gonna be ok heading home? You look a little paler than usual."

"God you sound like my mom, I'll be fine! Honest." I laughed, putting on a smile and trying desperately to act normal. I clocked out and grabbed my coat before opening the office door for the southern belle. She curtsied with a giggle and we headed out the office building into the rainy parking lot. I walked her to her car, listening to her complain about our boss and probably other mundane office drama. That mixed with the rain spattering on concrete, was the white noise I needed to help drown out the shadow of worry that crept at the back of my mind.

"Jamie, you are a terrible listener you know that?? I've been talking nonsense about African Unicorn puppies and you just said 'uh huh' as if that was a real thing!" She flicked the back of my neck with her giant acrylic nail, most likely leaving a mark.

"Ow- ok sorry sorry, I'm just a little distracted right now. Honestly, I probably won't get any sleep tonight. Maybe I should call Avery or something." Stacy furrowed her brow and puffed her cheeks, looking almost like a toddler with her rounded cheeks.

"Avery?? She your new side thing?" She spoke with a hint of venom in her voice. I shrugged and stopped beside her red Volkswagen beetle.

"We went on a date last night to see Dawn of the Dead. It's a great classic, but I'm not sure she's a horror fan. She clung to me like saranwrap the entire time." I chuckled and rubbed the back of my neck sheepishly. Stacy rolled her eyes and punched me in the arm lightly.

"Well, mister Casanova, make sure you don't make this one run crying like the others."

"It was just the one and she tripped while roller skating! I had nothing to do with that!" I shot her an annoyed look as she burst out laughing.

"Yeah I know, it's just fun teasing you. You gonna be ok going home? My door is always open, ya know." Stacy had always been the hospitable type, but the thought of going to her place felt like crossing live wires over a pool of water. Complicated and dangerous.

"I'll be fine, promise. You get home and feed your crocodile or whatever it is you have."

"He is a turtle! I- you know what, no I'm not playing this goofy little parking lot game of yours, its freezing and raining out, YOU can catch a could if you want to!" She whipped open her car door and stuck her tongue out at me. The nice thing about Stacy, was that she was a great distraction from horrible thoughts that could be lurking in the depths of your psyche. I waved as she started up her car and peeled out on to the busy street.

"Shit ... guess it's my turn now." I said to myself begrudgingly. I walked over to my Mazda 3 and started her up. The crackling sounds of radio static filled the space as visions of the creature seeped into the corner's of my thoughts with every passing second. My tongue grazed over the empty socket and I decided to give Avery a call.

"Hey it's Avery, I cant get to the phone right now, I'm either playing with the band or hugging my cat. Byee\~" The high pitched beep ruptured through the car speakers and I hung up the phone. She was probably working at the studio on her new album. I fixed my eyes to the road and decided to drive over and surprise her.

It didn't take long before I pulled up to the shabby looking studio building. Her car was parked outside next to three others. I unbuckled the seat belt and sprinted through the rain to the front door. Sounds of drums and guitar rifts were heard from outside.

The inside was dark with hallways stretching out in 5 different directions. Her studio space was at the far end of the building. As I walked down the darkened corridors, sound began to muffle around me and time started to feel like an imaginary concept. The walls darkened around me and labored breaths started to fill my mind. I closed my eyes for a moment to clear my thoughts, but as I opened them, I saw the outline of a familiar lanky figure standing at the end of the hall. I froze in place, unable to take another step, legs heavy like molasses, as the figure shook violently and flickered in and out of view, seemingly closing the space between us. I felt a hand grip my shoulder and I nearly jumped out of my skin. It was Avery, wearing a pair of ripped overalls, her pink dyed hair in a messy bun and her hazel eyes piercing me with glittering happiness. I shifted my gaze back down the corridor.

Nothing, I must be losing it.

"Hey handsome! Did I scare you? What are you doing here?" She smiled at me and gave me a kiss on the cheek.

"Fuck Ave, you gave me a heart attack. I uh- I wanted to come by and steal a sneak peak at your upcoming album. I'm selling the sample to your top competitor obviously." I gave her a hug and lifted her off her feet, wishing our embrace never be parted. Her melodious laugh rung in my ears and in an instant, the fear I felt just moments before washed away.

"I only have an hour left on the clock, after that we can hang out for a little while if you want." She said, as she held my hand in hers and guided me to the back room. I sat on one of the couches, watching her work. She was a vocalist and guitar player for an indie rock band. They weren't well known, but their music was good. I had actually met her at one of her very first open mic performances a few months ago, since then there was nothin but sparks between us.

"Alright that's a wrap guys! We'll work more on the backing track tomorrow and maybe add some sick sound effects to the hook vocals." She hugged her band members as they shuffled out the door, talking about sound equipment and other music jargon I didn't understand. Avery hopped onto my lap and planted a slow, soft, kiss on my lips.

"Well damn, ok I've never done it in a studio before but I'll happily give it a go." I teased pulling her in for one more kiss. She pulled back, scrunching her nose at me.

"Ew no! It's beyond dirty in here. Do you know how much saliva and skin cells must be all over this place? They only clean the space like once a week. By the way, you look super tired, did you get any sleep last night?" She stared into my eyes, like she was searching for a lost object within my pupils.

"Eh, sleep is for the dead, I'll be fine." I joked, mostly because I didn't want to worry her. She didn't know about the nightmares, and maybe it was better to keep it that way for now. She raised an eyebrow and squinted at me, she wasn't buying it, I could tell.

"Ugh, fine you don't have to tell me, but maybe you should try some meditation or something to clear your head of whatever is bothering you. That job of yours isn't good for the soul, you got to feed your spirit sometimes." Maybe she was right, it wouldn't hurt to try. We walked out of the studio and made out in the back of the Mazda for a while before deciding to part ways. Part of me wanted to invite myself to her place, but we weren't quite there in the relationship. Neither of us had been to each other's place yet, and I wasn't about to have our first time be in the middle of the weird toothless headspace I was in.

The drive home was quiet. Filled with nothing but the pitter patter of rain on my windshield, and the low rumbles of the car engine. I reached the apartment complex and ran my fingers though wet strands of hair that stuck to the sides of my face. I should probably get a haircut. I looked up at my review mirror to see dark purple circles and a hollow stare looking back at me. God I looked like hell. I placed two fingers on the top and bottom lid of both eyes, stretching them wide open. Suddenly, I heard muffled movement from behind and 2 lidless eyes peered at me in the review mirror. I screamed and pushed open my car door trying desperately to get away from the horror in my backseat. I felt myself get yanked back in the car, sweat poured down my face and my mind screamed at me to get out. In a panic, I had forgotten to unbuckle my seatbelt and I reached in with trembling hands to press the button, releasing myself onto the concrete. Whipping around quickly, I kicked the door closed and slowly pushed myself back on my feet, worried that any sudden movement might trigger it to come jumping out from inside the car. But when I looked at the back seat, it was completely empty. Incredibly shaken, I dragged my feet towards the apartments.

The parking lot was dark so I turned on my phone light on my way back to the desolate room. The entire walk up the stairs, I questioned myself and what I had kept seeing all day. I know what I saw. He .. or it was in my car. I know it. I finally reached room 413, and fumbled for the keys. I turned the key in the lock and paused for a moment.

I didn't want to be back here.

Pushing the door open, the disheveled room came in full view. Mattress overturned from this morning, clothes strewn about, and the bathroom light still on. Just the way I had left it.

A mess.

I sighed and closed the door behind me with a click.

"Guess I should clean this shit up. Should give that meditation thing a try." I rearranged the room, putting clothes in their respective places, mattress back on the bed and closed the bathroom door. After everything was put back in their rightful spot, I plopped down on my kitchen bar stool and laid my head on top of my arms, what an incredibly exhausting day. It felt like all the energy had evaporated from my body once I sat down. As my body settled, I could feel my eye lids getting heavier, and the room getting dimmer. I jolted upright just as I was about to knock out, that's right, I couldn't sleep. I shouldn't sleep. Right? That thing will get to me if I do, and then what? More of my teeth go missing? No thank you. I propped myself up and began researching mediation techniques.

Some were more complicated than others. The most straightforward one seemed to show a man sitting in a crisscross position, hands folded in his lap and eyes closed. The eyes closed part was what I was worried about. Yoga, I didn't have the flexibility for, but one was journaling and writing down thoughts. As you may have guessed from this post, that's the one I went with. The more I write, the more everything seems to be a jumble of coincidences. Maybe I'm overreacting, maybe the tooth fell out for another reason. I won't know till I see my dentist in a few days. Till then, I'll keep you posted if anything happens.

Maybe ... I'll get some sleep. Maybe not.

We will see.

Jamie signing off.
