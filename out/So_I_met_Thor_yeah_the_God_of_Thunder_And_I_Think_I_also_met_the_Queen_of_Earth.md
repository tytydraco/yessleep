It was a Monday at around 3 am when it happened. A huge man fell from the sky right into the patio of the house where I lived. Not my house but I lived there. The renting situation in Mexico in poor neighborhoods is a bit different but that's not important. My bathroom was outside on the other side of the house so although it was freezing I had to get up to go pee. Which I totally forgot about when this 240 centimeter tall dude almost crushed me to death with his own body.

Naturally my reaction was to cover my ears and start screaming for help. But he was fully conscious so as fast as lightning he covered my mouth and let himself into my room/apartment with me in his arms and my mouth, or should I say face, covered with one of his hands. As you do I obviously tried with all my strength to get away since I hate being touched and the sound of his fall had already freaked me out so I was having a bad time to say the least.

"Wait, wait, wait before you say something I gotta ask" he said as he let go of me and let himself fall on my bed. Breaking it. Shattering it sounds like a more appropriate word.

"I'm… I'm a- an…. I don't know?"

I tried shielding myself but it was useless. So I just sat on the floor facing the wall. My mini closet was broken so I couldn't escape there this time.

Really had no idea what the fuck was happening so I was speechless and a lot scared. 

"You seem weak." Said the big man. "My name is Thor Odinson.

There was an awkward pause and then he tried getting me back up on my feet but I couldn't even look at him so I squatted back down. 

"I'm not the bad guy if that's what you're thinking." He said with a soft voice. Which wasn't that soft but at least it wasn't thunderous anymore. "I come from a place called asgard…"

"Yeah I watched the movies too!" I interrupted. "What's next? Loki sent you through a portal? Was it Odin?" I think I was starting to get a little angry. "Where's your hammer Thor? Where's your hammer?!" 

No idea where I got the courage from.

He stayed quiet for a while. I couldn't tell if he was angry or confused. But my years of studying face expressions told me he was both plus shocked. It quickly turned into pure rage.

"You almost got me, you horse fucker shit!" 

I was suddenly with my head on the ground being held down by his massive hand. I could've felt my orbital bone shattering. The pressure clearly meant I lost my eye.  Not even the pain and adrenaline together stopped me from thinking how I had no way of getting fixed. Reconstructive surgery was not something I could be able to afford in decades. I was going to be deformed my whole Iife. I guess it was something good it was about to end soon when I felt my cranium start breaking under the pressure. It was like a block of concrete. I didn't even scream. I probably couldn't. That I don't know why.

The shock was too much and the hit was too fast.

"In the name of all the mighty fathers unhand the boy!" 

Now that was a strong voice that left my ears ringing. And all a sudden I was blind. I thought it was the crushing but no… they had been burnt in an instant. My eyes were gone. Burnt away.

"You wait here." The voice said as It carried me.

"That's fucking Loki your carrying on your arms!" Thor shouted with all his strength but this time I wasn't bothered by it.

"You're on my universe and on the realm gifted to me by the strongest of all the mighty fathers so shut the fuck up. And we'll handle it in a minute and 45 seconds. Human time."

Everything had been so unreal. I mean I just needed to pee which I didn't anymore at some point. So unreal and weird that I hadn't noticed my eyesight was back. And I was completely healed. 

She was a woman. Kind looking. Pale skin. Black eyes. But beautiful. It was like looking into the universe. I couldn't help but stare.

"As a sorry for letting a god from another universe harm one of my humans, I'll give you a gift you don't have to take if you don't want to of course. You have a gift, it's like your superpower." She smiled kindly; like moms do to their kids in the movies. 

"And it's beautiful too." She continued. "But if you want me to remove your autism I will." She ended her mini apology speech. 

I didn't. So I said no but since I didn't want her to be late I quickly asked her if I could have eyes like hers.

"They're beautiful, aren't they? She giggled. "Done." She winked.

And just like that she and Thor were gone. 

I looked up to the sky just to see them fighting. I couldn't make out what was happening exactly but I was sure they were engulfed in fire.

The  color of my eyes changed but I didn't have super eyesight(kind of a shame). It was just a color change. 

Who was she? And that was definitely the real Thor. He didn't know we knew about them and I almost paid for it. 

Should I go looking for answers? I need to get myself a god of war game. Be ready for next time I guess.
