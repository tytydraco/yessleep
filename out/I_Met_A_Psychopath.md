I met a psychopath. Statistically, you’ve probably met a psychopath, too.



*Statistically*, I’ve probably met loads of psychopaths, but only three ever got close enough for me to see it. Of course, there’s no way for me to be certain, but the signs were all there.



The first person was, and will forever be, someone extremely important to me. Many aspects of who I am, if not all, are due to my interactions with them.



The second person has already been to prison and will likely return someday.



The third was… a much shorter, much *kinder* relationship. He’s who we’ll talk about.



I didn’t know he was a psychopath when I met him, but I was instantly drawn to him. He seemed different than everyone else; more observant, more introspective. I remember feeling an overwhelming urge to comfort him. It’s hard, looking back: how much of this was genuine, and how much of it was manipulated out of me?



I wonder what he thought of me? If I had to guess, I’d say he found me somewhat fascinating, and I realize how self-indulgent that comes across.



I’m an intensely emotional person. I think my raw, untethered, and unrefined emotion represented something out of reach for him. Something he couldn’t quite understand and even longed for… Or maybe I was just a fun toy.



In the video game industry, there’s a well-known concept called *responsiveness*. We spend lots of time making sure players’ actions have visual and auditive feedback; that the game *responds*.



Nobody’s satisfied by clicking a dead button. No- It’s the little sound it makes, the way it changes colours when we click it, that ultimately gives the player the little hit of dopamine they so badly need. The fact that I’m so emotional, so *responsive,* was likely very attractive to my psychopathic friend. It likely made me entertaining in the same way clicking a button in a video game is.



Don’t misunderstand! I don’t mean to paint him as cruel, rather, I think he was curious. I think he found me and all my different reactions interesting…



You may have picked up by now that the relationship is over. This was somewhat of a theme in his life: short-lived relationships that seemed to end with no real resolution. Just one of the many signs that slowly revealed who he truly was.



The first time I ever truly considered psychopathy was the first time he threatened my life. I think he was testing me, watching how I’d react, clicking the button… Maybe he thought warning me about what he wanted to do somehow absolved him of doing it.



He later wrote it off as a joke, of course. Regardless, death threats concealed as jokes became a ‘thing’ in our relationship. So did jokes about his ‘ice-cube’ heart and enormous ego. He was actually quite well-natured when in a good mood. I miss that side of him.



I find myself wondering if he ever thinks of me sometimes. On the one hand, I understand that he didn't care about me in the way you would expect a human to. On the other hand, I think I evoked something in him that was rare.



I *knew* he was incapable of love. I didn’t care.



I don’t value my relationships based on whether the other person loves me. In fact, I’m not sure how I value my relationships, but it’s definitely not that. It was never a problem that he was incapable of love, as long as he gave me his version of it.



I didn’t just *understand* him; I *accepted* him, death threats and all. I wasn’t afraid of him. I knew how to manage him. “The monk and the scorpion,” my one friend joked over an Aperol Spritz.



I also challenged him, albeit subtly. He had many preconceived notions about me, and I liked to prove him wrong. Each time I did, he seemed more interested in me.



He never expected me to be smart, and he especially didn’t expect me to be smarter than him, not that he’d ever admit it. He never expected me to be funny. He never expected me to have passions, and pillars, and depth. His interactions with me remind me of my first conversation with an AI.



Perhaps one of the nicest things he ever said to me was, “You are anything but basic”. I had asked him why he was so selective when it came to dating, and he told me he couldn’t stand girls with robust social lives, or “basic bitches”, as he put it.



“Oh no, I’m so basic, though,” I joked. It was my way of challenging the blatant misogyny. I knew he liked me and that he had categorized me as such in the past.



“You are anything but basic,” he said.



I think these realizations made him hate me. ”You might be a bitch, though” he’d later add.



He hated that I could be funny, smart, social, and complex… and *feel*. How could I be all these things that he was and still not see myself as better than everyone else? Why was I behaving like the peasants? Why would I cry and care when I was (almost) as good as him?



As our bond grew and I proved myself to him, he started to see me as an equal. Not *fully* an equal, always beneath him, but not as far down as others. When I wonder whether he thinks of me sometimes, I know it wouldn’t be because he cared about me, but I think he probably misses me a little. He’d met his match, and he knew it.



Maybe this is just my way of coping with how our relationship ended. The truth is, I cared about him deeply, and it’s comforting to think it was reciprocated at all.



In many ways, he was also the kindest person I ever met. He was the person who most advocated for my well-being. When we met, I was in a rough place, and he encouraged me to do things that made my life better. I would never have applied to my current job if it weren’t for him. 



“Your life matters, and not because of what you can do for other people”, he said. I sobbed when I read that.



He seemed genuinely invested in my well-being, and I listened to him when he gave me suggestions. Something about the way he said it resonated with me.



Ultimately, my insecurities got the best of me, and for a moment, I forgot about his limitations. I asked him to confirm that he cared about me. Not love- but his version of it.



I was blocked immediately.



He never gave me the decency of closure. Being discarded so easily hurt, but ironically, I could handle it because he himself had taught me to value myself. Sometimes, like today, I wonder if he blocked me out of some twisted sense of kindness.



At first, it felt like a punishment, but then it felt like he was cutting me free. Like he was saying, “I can’t give you what you want, and I don’t want to hurt you.”



I waited for him, after that. If I heard a noise outside my window at nightime, I would check it wasn’t him, but he never came. He never unblocked me. And I don’t think he ever will.



I think he *did* care about me, in his psychopathic way. I think that’s *why* he blocked me. Some part of him realized I was never going to abandon him, and our argument made him see that hurting me was inevitable. That someone as emotional as me would always crave the love he genuinely could not give.
