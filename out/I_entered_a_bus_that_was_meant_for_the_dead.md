"You're one of us, aren't you?" the bus driver said.

The man had a smile on his face. On this dark and empty street, he held his door open, waiting for me to step in.

"Yes."

I made my way inside. Maybe four or five other passengers sat there. Creatures just like me: pale and tired, some of them covered in vomit. I couldn't care less. I was without a home and needed a warm place to stay. I leaned my head against the window. The engine rumbled. Soon we were on our way.

We drove through the dark night, every so often stopping alongside the sidewalk. More and more people entered the bus. Most of them old and senile.

I thought it was a soup kitchen they were bringing us to. Maybe a homeless shelter. Why else would you drive around the city picking people up at random?

When I woke up, hours had passed. Still, we hadn't reached our destination. A man sat next to me. He was young, holding his eyes shut. A pocket knife was stuck in his stomach. Blood was dripping through his shirt.

"He won't move. No matter what I do," I yelled at the bus driver.

His eyes were glued to the road. He spoke slowly. His voice was deeper than it should have been.

"What's the problem? Let him rest before his big day."

"He is hurt."

"Yeah, murdered apparently. If that's what's bothering you, feel free to change seats."

I made my way back. I watched the people around me. The nervousness in their eyes. The horrible fates all of them had been met with. A suspicion arose in my head. Minute by minute my fear grew. No signs, no cluster of buildings. The street ahead of us was completely unrecognizable.

"Where exactly are we going?"

"Oh, that I cannot tell you. Not yet at least."

I stood next to the driver. Sweat covered the palms of my hands. The cryptic messages. The people staring at us in horror. It was all too much for me.

"Please let me get out. I don't belong here," I begged.

Moments after the words left my mouth, the bus came to a screeching halt. Right in the middle of the road, the man slammed on the brakes. I stumbled towards the ground. The driver towered over me, eyes yellow and bloodshot.

"What do you mean, you don't belong here?"

"I mean... I mean... I'm not dead."

The man's face was that of speechless confusion. A murmur ran across the crowd. They covered their mouths in shame, as if to hide from my aliveness.

"A mistake," he whispered, "a mistake on the first day of my job. Oh, what will he think of me now? I have to fix this. Somehow I have to fix this."

Before I could react, the beast had picked me up by the shoulders. He buried his fist in my stomach. A left hook connected. I tried to run away, screaming for help. The next second I was in the air, flying towards the window. The sound of shattering glass. A pain like no other.

Why hadn't the passengers rescued me? Was it the fear of what was to come once the bus would reach its destination? Judgment Day? I couldn't know. They were paralyzed. I was left alone as the demon pounced.

Inches stood between us. I jumped towards the already broken window, just for a moment feeling the crushing strength of his grip around my neck. I slammed onto the asphalt, tumbling towards the forest. The fear numbed my pain. His voice echoed through my head while I fled deeper and deeper into the woods.

"I will find you," the man promised. "Things far beyond your understanding are at play here."

Reports tell me I was rescued somewhere along the borders of Montana. According to the doctors, I'm all better now. Still, nothing feels the same as before. I think they will never understand the horrors that haunt me.

After hearing my story, I thought you might understand. Tell me: is there a way out of this mess? How can I save myself from a man that even the dead fear?
