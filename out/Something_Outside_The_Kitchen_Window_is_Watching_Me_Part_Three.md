\- - -

What was I afraid of? I believe some part of me at that moment still held onto the thought that it was all in my head, that everything unfolding was just a figment of my imagination, albeit a viscerally real one; the only thing that kept it—that kept me from the reality of the situation was truly asking for help—from seeking help.

To seek help is to believe that something was wrong, that it was real—every minute detail.

*"Hello...?"*

My train of thought had completely derailed when my gaze landed on a pair of greyish-blue eyes.

*"Is Mr. Jobert here?"* I asked, as the girl standing before me was Cindy. Mr. Jobert's only child and daughter. She stood puzzled; I assumed my knocks unnerved her in some way, as the panic within my system was clouded by the feeling of bashfulness, standing before the brunette-haired girl.

*"No, and is there something wrong?"*

I shook my head, letting out a quiet sight. I wasn't sure what to do then; I still felt the need to tell someone about what I had just encountered earlier today, but to tell her? Someone who's practically a stranger to me, as I was to her. We've never spoken, only occasionally saw each other once in a while around the hall. I never asked about her, nor did Mr. Jobert often talk to me about his daughter, almost as if it were an unspoken rule that she was completely off limits; I didn't have to know her or anything about her, and I had to respect that.

She glanced at me with furrowed brows, seemingly analyzing my expression; could she tell I was lying? *"Its just that... I could've sworn I heard you call out for help; did you need my dad's help with something?"*

*"No, I'm sorry, I have to go— apologies for bothering you—"*

I was about to turn my heel until I felt stopped in my tracks as my wrist was pulled back causing me to halt. *"Wait— you live beside 506 right?"* She asked, her eyes held a little more than concern, they held urgency. Glancing down at my wrist I could see how she held me back from leaving, her hands held taut, before pulling back with another apology.

*"Yeah, 505"* I mumbled before she glanced past me, as I turned to see what her gaze was focused on. Feeling a slight unease in my nerves as my eyes landed on the two doors at the other end of the hall.

*"Do you know what happened...?"*

Her eyes held a perplexed expression, I felt slightly unnerved by the way she looked at me. Though, I wasn't sure whether it was the fact that she was a girl or simply the look of expression on her face.

*"I'm sorry?"*

*"What happened to the apartment beside yours."* She reiterated.

I shook my head once more unsure what she was talking about. I have been naively oblivious to everything around me, more specifically around the apartment. It wasn't until recently that I started paying attention to my neighbors and the other tenants, as I've kept myself locked in my own space for so long. If it wasn't for Mr. Jobert offering to help me move my couch inside, I probably wouldn't have had the pleasure of knowing the man, even if he was my neighbor.

*"Come in."* She gestured going inside the apartment to let me through the door, the sound of her footsteps disappearing into the living room, as I closed the door behind me.

*"I've been doing some digging around this place for the past year—this building. The whole thing is practically being held together with duct tape and toothpicks."*

*"What? I don't understand."*

I stood confused, as I watched her pick up a cardboard box, toppling its contents onto the dining table nearby as a slurry of papers, news articles, and miscellaneous bags with labels were scattered on the wooden surface. *"I'm saying... something is going on right under your noses."* She said as she handed me a printed page of a news article from 2001.

*"Family of seven dies in an apartment fire."* I read out loud.

*"I'm sorry, what does this have to do with anything? What the hell are all of these..."*

My words caught in my throat as my mind began to process what I just said out loud, with a frantic motion my gaze focused back onto the paper, reading the article intently, while Cindy stood with a slight annoyance in her expression, crossing her arms as the slight scowl slowly eased into understanding.

**Family Of Seven Dies In An Apartment Fire**  
*December 28, 2001 • By Aidan K.*

In the early morning of December, a family of seven tragically succumbed to an apartment fire in Richmond, Virginia. A flat in Crestview Commons was engulfed in flames, caused by an undetected gas leak discovered during the investigation.

Authorities uncovered the remains of the Gonzales; two adults, and a 15 year-old-boy was found. The remains of four Gonzales children; one 13 year-old-girl, two children below the age of 10, and a toddler could not be conclusively identified amidst the aftermath but were ultimately presumed deceased.

Residents reported hearing a loud explosion around 2:30 a.m., followed by flames rapidly spreading through the apartment complex not long after. Emergency responders arrived at the scene around 2:47 A.M. but fire had already consumed much of the apartment flat. Luckily first responders were able to extinguish the flames before causing more damage by spreading further onto other flats.

Despite their efforts, the family—two parents, and five children—was unable to escape in time.

*"At Elmwood, we take the safety and security of our residences very seriously, our team of professionals take regular inspections with great caution for the comfort of our residents. We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of the Gonzales family and will waive rent for all residents of Crestview Commons this month as a gesture of solidarity. We send our love and condolences to the grieving families of the affected during this tough time." —* ***Samuel D. / Elmwood Properties.***

Crestview's residents are left reeling, with many expressing concerns about the building's aging infrastructure and other issues with individual apartments. The management company, Elmwood Properties, declined any further statements, in regard to questions about the building's maintenance.

A memorial service for the Gonzales' is being planned by family and friends, with details forthcoming.

. . .

*"This isn't possible."* My voice felt hoarse, roughly emitting from my throat as I simmered further, taking in the development of information. The night I heard those voices, seeing the article with a photo attached with a crime scene photo of the burnt-out apartment from the outside, made it all felt too real. Whatever skepticism I had left chipped away entirely, as my hands held historical evidence, physically tangible within my grasp.

*"T-They didn't even bother cleaning the fucking apartment, even after all these years. This statement is complete bullshit!"*

The agitation in my stammered words must've had Cindy confused, as her solemn expression contorted to furrowed confusion.

*"What are you talking about?"* She asked.

*"I mean, they haven't even cleaned out or even renovated 506. I've been inside, I saw how disgusting and abandoned it was."*

*"You got in?"*

A look of bewilderment etched onto her face as she walked closer with intent, seemingly wanting to hear more. I debated whether or not to tell her about what I saw, what I heard, and everything I'd been experiencing for the past weeks, but as I looked at the scattered items on the desk and the printed news article in my hand, I let out a deep sigh.

I told her everything, starting from the beginning. The minor occurrences; from the dirty smudges on the floor, missing groceries, and hearing footsteps that weren't my own. I laid it all out for this girl who was barely an acquaintance, and who I'm fairly certain doesn't even know my name. Despite everything, she was here, the only present body who had an open ear to listen to me, who was ready to hear what I had to say, whether judgment was at the tip of her tongue or not.

I felt weary sharing more about the heavier occurrences. Her unease was evident when I recounted what I'd heard on the other side of the wall in my room—what I now realized to be the last moments of the Gonzales family on the night of the fire. I also told her about my earlier visit to apartment 506 and how I'd left a trail of dust in my wake as I fled the abandoned flat.

Feeling the weight slightly ease the burden from my shoulders as I told her everything, her eyes never showed any other emotion rather than curiosity and understanding; staying quiet the whole time I spoke, a contrast to the reaction I anticipated.

*"So I came here... to talk to Mr. Jobert— to your dad*—*about everything I just told you. He's the only person in this building that's been kind to me, he's the only person that I could consider a friend in this fucked up place."*

*"You're pretty close to my dad, huh? Makes sense why you've been avoiding me like the plague when I would come to visit."* She spoke, carrying a faint smirk with her light quip, I felt a slight fluster creep up behind my neck from her implication, though melting away as her eyes soon gave a distant look. 

*"He's been very protective of me, ever since..."* Her words trailed along with her gaze, as it focused on the window nearby, following its direction I watched the parted curtains make way for the afternoon glow outside.

*"My Mom died."*

A heavy pause settled between us, the air had grown thick and awkward, though it didn't last long as she interrupted the silence with a sigh. I almost made the mistake of stumbling upon my own words, contemplating on responding right then and there, if it wasn't for her\*—\*

*"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to trauma-dump."* She spoke out abruptly.

*"No, it's fine. I'm sorry as well... for your loss I mean."* So close.

She nodded before thanking me, brushing off the topic, avoiding the painful silence that threatened to frost over once more.

We shifted the conversation to her findings—instances of previous tenants and residents leaving the building abruptly due to their apartments deeming unsafe.

*"I know... this all looks crazy."*

Brushing her hair back with her fingers, she looked around the mess she's caused on her dad's dining table. *"But growing up, I've seen what people in power would do to those that are weaker than them. My Mom fought for the truth, she... she fought for the Gonzales' family all those years ago, she knew Josephine—they were friends. My parents lived in this apartment for years. I told my father to move out years ago, especially after Mom had passed, but he... he just couldn't let go. Not of the apartment—but of her."*

A sad sigh escaped her lips as she sank into a dining chair, avoiding my gaze. She seemed deep in thought, silently wrestling with emotions she hadn't fully processed.

*"My investigation began when my friend Tessa started interning for Elmwood Properties' headquarters,*" she continued, her tone shifting. *"She was stuck with filing and categorizing documents when she came across a whole binder of information about Crestview. I found it strange at first, when she handed the binder to me. I even asked if it was safe—if she'd lose her job. But she said they probably wouldn't even notice it was missing since the binder was so outdated."*

I listened intently, as she sifted through the papers and information she gathered—likely everything from the said binder. 

She pulled out a photograph of a woman. A picture was of a brunette woman with familiar greyish-blue eyes—features that bore an almost uncanny resemblance to the girl before me. Scrawled across the image in red ink were the words *Gonzales' Case Journalist.*

*"I have to know why they have this photo of her, why they had her labelled like some target."* she said, her voice resolute. *"And I know, the only way I can continue investigating is to know what my Mom couldn't find out back then. To finish what she started."*

Her voice brimmed much determination, flipping the portrait back to her, staring at the image of her mother. *"She's the reason why I even chose Investigative Journalism."* Her eyes held a longing sadness, despite the chuckle in her tone. 

Her eyes stayed looking at the photo, while I couldn't even utter a single word as my attention was fixated on her. I let her talk, say everything she needed to and digest as much information as I could, it's all I could do, it's all she needed from me.

With silence inevitably permeating the room, the quiet was abruptly interrupted by a familiar jarring ring, echoing around the apartment.

*"My Dad—he's home, help me clean up."*

Her voice shifted to a frantic tremble, hastily piling the spilled contents of the box, back into hiding. *"Wait— why are you hiding these things, doesn't he know..."* The words died in my throat as the obvious began to weigh in my mind, as she simply gave me a knowing look. *"Oh— oh right, he wouldn't let you... O—Okay."* stammering, I joined her in dumping the contents back into the box.

After the second doorbell we could hear the muffled voice of Mr. Jobert behind the door. *"Cindy? Are you home?"* He asked, pressing the doorbell once more.

*"Just a minute, I'm changing!"* Cindy shouted out, running across the apartment with the box clutched within her hands as she wobbled to get to her room.

I had to improvise. With a hare-brained idea, I unlocked and opened the door.

*"Mr. Jobert! Sorry, I was at the bathroom. I stopped by to come and see you, I didn't know you wouldn't be home so I waited."* I spoke, half-truthfully, as the older man walked in observing the surroundings of his home.

*"Where's Cindy?"*

*"She's at her room."*

Our gaze led down the hall, at the closed door. *"So, what are you here for?"* He asked, walking to the living room as his eyes trailed to the dining table, nothing seemingly out of place.

*"I wanted to chill here for a bit while Mr. Grant was fixing up my apartment. You know the man talks and talks, I didn't wanna be in my apartment to listen to him rant about the other tenants."*

He chuckled at my words, placing his wallet and keys onto a nearby stand, before making his way to the kitchen.

*"So, you spoke to Cindy?"*

I nodded, feeling slightly uncomfortable knowing the directions the question from him would lead to.

*"She's cool, I haven't really had the chance to speak or meet her properly so it was nice to get properly acquainted."* I spoke calmly, despite the apple on my head, nervously feeling the target above me, as his eyes felt pointed and sharper.

*"Dad, you're back early."*

Cindy's voice permeated the tense atmosphere, as she walked in casually, with a poised nonchalance. She really had changed her clothing, knowing her Dad would notice the lie if she was caught with the same clothing she wore before he left. Slipping her phone back into her pocket, she stood by the kitchen archway.

*"Yeah, I grabbed the wrong receipt to refund. I'll just do it tomorrow, there's 13 more days left anyways."* He shrugged, letting out a relaxed sigh.

*"Great, I actually have to go, I'm gonna go out on errands, and hang out with... Tessa."* She spoke, pausing slightly, seemingly thinking of a name. She was lying, the brief glance towards me to avoid her father's gaze as she told a lie.

*"Okay, don't be out too late. Call me when something happens."*

It didn't seem Mr. Jobert caught on the lie, or trusted her enough that she would be doing exactly what she said she would.

Cindy left, almost abruptly as silence once more permeated the apartment as I sat on the living room couch, pulling out my phone as I used Mr. Jobert's Wi-Fi. We spoke casually, he asked a few questions about how I was doing and how school was, and if I was still experiencing anything strange in my apartment.

I didn't want to lie him, I wanted to tell the truth, to tell Mr. Jobert everything, just as I told Cindy earlier, but if I was going to investigate and uncover what happened to the Gonzales along side her, keeping Mr. Jobert in the dark as Cindy wanted it to be, would make things easier for her\*—\*for us both. 

*"I'm out, your A/C is all fixed up kid. Don't call me again if something comes up. Text."*

My phone dinged a message notification as I read the text from Mr. Grant, I felt a slight ease on my chest knowing one of my problems was solved. Also the fact that I had a reason to slip away from Mr. Jobert's apartment without having to make him feel as if I was brushing him off or was uncomfortable.

*"Oh— Mr. Grant texted me saying the air-conditioning in my apartment is fixed, mind if I go and check it out? Just come by if you need anything."*

I tried my best to sound casual as possible, though it didn't seem to matter as Mr. Jobert's eyes didn't leave the book he had prompt on his hands. *"It's fine. Make sure that Grant didn't half-ass the repairs, or else that thing would break again in less than a week."* He spoke gruffly as I chuckled, his regular quips always did put a smile on my face, even if briefly. Which made the guilt in my chest clench tighter.

With a nod I was out the door, the moment the dark oak wood made a thud echoing around the hall, I felt a pair of arms grab me—forcing me into the emergency exit nearby, practically adjacent to the apartment. I panicked—almost letting out a loud protest if it wasn't for the hand clasping on my mouth. Struggling, I felt my body being tugged—with my head leaned in, I felt my hair being pulled into the stairwell.

By the time I formed a coherent through, the girl stood before me with her index finger against her lips, gesturing for me not to make a sound.

*"Sorry, I had to make sure I wouldn't get spotted by my dad."* She huffed, though she didn't really seem apologetic for almost giving me a heart-attack.

*"Was yanking my hair really necessary?"* I grumbled, as she shrugged.

*"You're bigger than me, I had to get you in here one way or another."* Unapologetic, her tone made me chuckle slightly. Before I could retort, she had already pulled out her phone showing me a location in her map.

*"This is Elmwood Headquarters; it's not too far of a drive."* She said, and I looked confused.

*"We have to talk to Drover, I want to know more about what we're dealing with, even if I have to press for more answers... even if it gets us in trouble."* She had a look of determination once more, a reflection of the fact that she's been simmering in this investigation for a long time, unraveling each clue and information piece by piece for the past year or so.

She was far more ready than I ever would be to face what was on the other side of it all, but I was still willing to make the jump if it meant uncovering the truth.

It didn't take long for Cindy and me to reach the building. We used my car, driving around the city for half an hour until we arrived at our destination. The Elmwood Headquarters loomed before us—a towering structure of glass and steel that reached up high to pierce the clouds above. Its sleek, modern design contrasted, sticking out like a sore thumb with the aging buildings surrounding its premises.

At that moment, as we both stood out in the parking lot, the withered trees of winter made the already dreary atmosphere seem dead amidst the snow, resembling ashfall. At the heart of it all was Elmwood, its megastructure sucking the life out of its surroundings, the company logo so saccharine and inviting—a mockery of what we presumed lay within its corporate walls.

I didn't know what to expect—Cindy didn't seem to either—but we pushed through those revolving doors with puffed chests, bracing ourselves for what's to come. Truthfully, I wasn't even sure if we'd even make it as far as the waiting area outside Drover's office. Yet, with Cindy at my side we found ourselves standing in the middle of a dreary minimalistic atmosphere, the room exuded an oppressive sterility, void of any color other than modern black, polished white and formal grey. 

At the far end, the woman behind the desk, dabbled away on her desk keyboard, her fingers gracing past each key with precision, not bothering to spare a glance, knowing exactly what our presence meant in that waiting room.

*"I'm sorry, you can't go in without an appointment, Mr. Drover isn't seeing anyone right now—"*

The secretary behind the desk spoke, her blonde hair neatly prompted up in a bun, not bothering to spare a glance at us both, with her eyes tired and empty behind the sharp frames of her glasses. Cindy huffed shaking her head. *"I'm not leaving until we see him, is that clear?"* Trepidation in her voice was evident, as the secretary reeled back on her seat, taken aback by Cindy's tone.

*"I'll see what I can do, but for now please... sit."* The secretary's murmured voice permeated our ears. Her words brought Cindy a sense of ease—compliant for now as she turned to take a seat at one of the black plush leather couches nearby.

With Cindy settled on the couch, my eyes averted to where she had stood earlier. A photo etched onto the brochure displayed on the desk was Mayor Kingsley—his face was familiar, and practically hard to forget due to his campaign posters being plastered around town every election season—even if the man has been mayor since the trilobites. Beside him stood a younger Samuel, as the pair stood together with their hands clasped together in unity.

***"Trust the Flow, Build the Future with Elmwood."*** 

We sat in silence for what felt like forever. Cindy kept her piercing glare on the grand oak wood door, a few feet away from the secretary's desk, as the lady behind the counter continued to take calls. The words I overheard from where I sat sounded like typical business jargon.

*"How long are we going to stay here?"* I asked.

*"As long as it takes,"* Cindy grumbled; I could tell she, too, was beginning to get impatient. We both knew they were planning to ice us out until we decided to leave.

*"Mr. Drover is busy today, so the wait might be longer, if you could just come back another day and—"* The secretary spoke out, her voice sounding even more worn down compared to earlier.

*"No. We can wait."* Cindy interrupted.

The blonde lady sighed. *"Okay."* She spoke defeatedly, returning her attention to her work as the oddly calming sound of her nails tapping on her keyboard, accompanied by the keys typing at a certain pace and rhythm put me in a light trance.

About two hours had passed and Cindy stayed unmoving in her seat\*—*gaze drifting from one place to another, as her arms crossed*,\* with her back against the couch cushion. At some point she closed her eyes, seemingly resting as her gentle breaths were slightly audible.

*"Sir, these kids won't leave without speaking to you."*

The secretary paused before her eyes trailed to where Cindy and I sat.

*"What are your names?"* She asked.

We briefly introduced our names before a long pause permeated the reception area after she repeated our them on the other line of the phone. Cindy and I looked at the woman behind the counter as her face contorted to a solemn expression. Nodding with the occasional hums of acknowledgment, she would turn her gaze towards me and Cindy before briefly looking down at her desk.

*"Understood sir,"* she spoke, before typing briefly as she brought the phone back down.

*"Are they gonna let us in?"* I asked, while Cindy sat keeping her eyes directly onto the woman who stayed silent. Her brows furrowed before standing up.

Before Cindy could even speak, the double doors at the far end of the area opened at an abrupt pace. The door slammed wide, and three guards dressed in black suits stepped into the room\*—\*immediately making their way toward me and Cindy. Their polished shoes took long strides, dragging deliberately across the floor as their distance grew closer.

*"Mr. Drover won't be seeing you today."* The blonde woman spoke.

*"We're not leaving until—"* Cindy defiantly, tried to stand her ground but the guards began to escort us both out of the room.

*"Ma'am, It'll be easier for all of us if you cooperate."* The guard tried to step towards her but she resisted, and in seeing the girl struggle, I had to step in.

*"Hey! Don't put your hands on her,"* I spoke out, trying to drown out the hint of nervousness I held in my throat.

Before I could react, both guards held onto me as the one guard restrained Cindy. We both struggled to get out of their grasp as I shook myself trying to free my arms loose while the three had me and Cindy on hold, being forcibly escorted out of the building. Throughout the process of being escorted out, at some point, Cindy and I stopped resisting as we got to the lobby before ultimately being shoved outside in the cold winter air.

At that moment as I sat on the snow-covered pavement, watching my breath in front of my eyes, I looked up at the girl with an apologetic look, wishing we could've done more in coming here, I also held a worried look with Mr. Jobert in mind, how I let his daughter be manhandled in front of me; the man would kill me if he knew.

The drive back was quiet, Cindy had her elbow propped against the window of the passenger seat as I focused on driving on the dimly lit road.

*"I have a 'go-fruit' bar in my bag if you're hungry?"* I broke the silence, keeping my eyes on the road, as she turned her attention towards me. I felt her piercing gaze, like a weight on my chest as I could see her expression from my peripheral view.

With her mouth slightly parted. *"Do you have water?"* she asked, as I nodded.

She took my bag from the backseat rummaging through my stuff before pulling out an unopened bottle of water, though with the drink in hand, her expression furrowed as her eyes saw something inside amidst the clutter.

*"Is this.."*

Her hands dug through the bag once more, before pulling out the brochure. The saccharine image it gave off was hard to ignore, even from a brief peripheral glance.

*"Oh, that's the brochure I found earlier in the waiting room, where that secretary lady sat,"* I spoke, continuing to drive as she examined the image on the brochure.

*"This looks outdated. I... I remember seeing a photo like this at home too, when my Mom was still on the case, it was pinned on an investigation board in her office—before her evidence got taken away that is."*

I was about to speak but she cut me off before I could utter a word.

*"Can I keep this?"* She perked up, gesturing at the brochure.

*"Yeah.. not sure what you need it for though,"* I replied, briefly glancing at her before turning my eyes back onto the road.

*"I feel like... I'm getting closer to finding out what my Mom knew."*

With silence settling in, it felt comfortable this time. I could see it in her face—her once solemn expression, tinged with melancholy, now held a sliver of hope. I gave her a curt smile, as she nodded—slipping the brochure into her bag.

Despite it all, I could sense that the closer we were to find the truth, the more uncertain I was—whether I, or even Cindy, was prepared to uncover what had been buried from the world decades ago. What did her mother find out amidst the chaos, hidden behind the veil of deceit that Elmwood had so carefully placed over the public? Their misdeeds, their shortcomings—I don't think I was.

*"Are you prepared to know the truth?"* I asked curiously.

*"No, I never will be."*

Reluctantly, I returned to my apartment that night. Still in the same state as I left it that morning, with everything that had progressed throughout the day, I had completely forgotten that Grant had stopped by to fix the air-conditioning. I stood looking at the dirty smudge around the vents, making note to clean and paint over the ever-so charming remnants of fading mold.

Finally, I let out a sigh of relief, finally feeling the weight off of my shoulders from dealing with the air-conditioning problem that had lasted for almost a whole month at this point. I haven't had company in forever too, so it felt right on time that my air-conditioning was all fixed up.

*"Please excuse the... my apartment."* I spoke walking towards the girl sat with her laptop prompted on the kitchen counter. 

*"It's fine."* She replied absentmindedly, typing away on her computer. A short pause lingered before Cindy broke the silence. *"Look."* Turning her laptop towards me, she gestured at the screen showing me the contents of what she'd been fixated on for the past ten minutes. 

With squinted eyes, I peered closer to see a news article from 2000.

*"Elmwood Properties Partners with City to Launch Affordable Housing Initiative for Underserved Communities"* I read out loud, as the photo below was the very image imprinted on the brochure I took from the secretary's desk, except this time the background was no longer edited out—taken from the Mayor's office, the pair had their hands clasped on a shake for the cameras to capture.

Before I could continue to read further, Cindy turned the laptop back toward herself. *"That article outlines how they struck some deal to bring in 'affordable' housing for the underprivileged. Elmwood financed the builds, and the Mayor authorized the zoning regulations. On paper, it looks good—great, even—but if you look closer..."*

She scrolled down the page, pausing to let me glimpse at another photo embedded in the article—Elmwood's model homes surrounded by smiling people, families with happy and healthy grins, and children being held by their parents. A picture-perfect image of what Elmwood wanted the public to see—of what they wanted to portray.

*"They funneled taxpayer money into the project, jacked up rent prices the next year, and pushed out the people who couldn't pay anymore."* Cindy muttered bitterly, folding her arms, *"Bottomline is... it's pretty clear Elmwood and the Mayor go way back."* She spoke, glancing back at the screen once more with a piercing stare.

*"Samuel was their poster boy in the 2000s it seems... most of the articles about Elmwood back then had his face all over."* Cindy scrolled and typed once more, as I stood from behind her, getting a better look at the previous articles she's had prompted up.

*"Can you search for more articles or news blocks about the family’s case?"* I asked.

She sighed shrugging as she clicked off of a page. *"There's little to none, I've tried months ago. It feels like a dead-end."* Cindy sounded defeated, I felt bad for even asking as it would make sense she would've tried that long ago, especially when the case was still new to her.

With my eyes fixed on the words *"No results found."* I felt my brows furrow as my gaze focused on the blank screen. *"May I?"* I asked gesturing for permission to use the laptop briefly.

She hummed nodding, moving to the side to give me access to the computer.

*"Thank you."*

Immediately, I began pulling up an archival tool website, which retrieves older versions of web pages taken and archived throughout time. *"I'm trying to see if articles or pages got taken down at some point in time."* As soon as I clicked on the year 2002, there were more relevant searches written in December 2001.

*"What the hell? Good thinking.."* Cindy quipped as I chuckled thanking her.

Scrolling through the browser Cindy clicked her tongue. *"Of course, those pricks would try and hide articles that put Elmwood in a bad light."* She grumbled while I read in my mind the article headlines detailed on the page.

The majority of them already said what we knew or at least what the public was told back then; that a family had died in an accidental apartment fire caused by an undetected gas leak. I sighed, with furrowed brows as I scrolled through, not finding anything substantial to give us more.

I felt a sense of hopelessness. Did people truly care so little about this case, to not look further into what truly had happened? Not even a moment's thought to read between the lines of a story so conveniently cut and dry, so painfully clean? If the speculation was proven to be the truth, would the public even care for long? Or would they move on, leaving the affected families to pick up the pieces of what was left? It was all so unfair—utterly and devastatingly unfair.

"Wait stop." Cindy abrupted.

"What?"

Her finger pointed at a link to a video. "Sister of Elmwood fire pleas for justice" It read, as my hand practically jolted to click, immediately opening the video, prompting it up on the screen.

. . .

A woman in her late 20s prompted the camera to her face, standing outside what seemed to be a parking lot along with a group of individuals all aligned with posters and signs. Written within the signs were; ***"Justice for The Deceased"***, ***"We know the truth!"*** and ***"Stop the lies!"***. Those were the ones visible in the video, but it's pretty obvious there were more signs, as people at the back held up theirs before the camera shifted its focus back on to the young woman.

*"My name is Tina. I am the sister of the late Josephine."* She spoke with a look of determination in her eyes, though tiredness was evident. I felt a chill down my spine as she spoke with a rasping animosity in her voice.

*"My sister, along with her family was killed in the fire. I have no doubts about that. Today I, along with family and friends of the deceased are gathered to protest outside of Elmwood Headquarters to voice out the truth."* The camera panned around showing the groups of people in protest, and the familiar towering building, Cindy and I found ourselves not too long ago. Though without the renovations current in the present, it looked just as dreadful as it did 20 years ago.

*"They know the truth, I know the truth, and I'm sure as hell Elmwood knows it too. It's time the public finds out as well. What really happened to my sister—"* She paused glancing away from the camera as her expression turned from determination to anger.

*"The Drovers won't get away with this! Stop trying to hide the truth and bring justice to the victims!"* A voice yelled out from the background of the video as Josephine began to shout out the same sentiments with the crowd, their signs being held up higher than before.

It didn't take long until a group of guards, accompanied by law enforcement tried to tame the rioting crowd. Cindy looked visibly uncomfortable as her eyes were glued to the screen of the computer. *"We need you to leave."* an authoritative voice spoke from outside the frame, while Cindy and I were left to look at Tina's expressions, yelling at the security guard with her repeated mantra.

*"We know the truth! We know the truth!"* the repeated chant by the crowd echoed around the property, raising their signs in a blurried uniformed motion.

*"This is private property, you will be arrested for trespassing."* Another voice said in the background, carrying the same zealous moral conviction.

*"We're not leaving until—"* Tina's voice cut off, the camera's shaky visual was barely discernible before ultimately lying flat on the floor.

Tina was being dragged away, along with her fellow protestors as the policemen held the protesting group, relentless with their words as their voices slowly died out and faded into the background. The video was nearing its end until the camera was visibly picked up by a manicured hand blocking its lens, before ultimately cutting to black.
