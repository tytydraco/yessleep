I don’t know where else to post this. If it breaks any rules delete it. I just need some answers.

I have a daughter that will be 3 in October. She’s growing up so fast. Her name is Lily. This isn’t a sob story, I really just need to find some help for my daughter. Her mother had died shortly after giving childbirth. That was a hard chapter. I lost something that day but I was also blessed with a gift. The joy of having my daughter outweighed the pain I was dealing with from loosing my wife. I’m not saying it was easy, I’m just still considering myself blessed despite my hardships.

Lily had been learning new words and just saying every word she heard. This really excelled after her 2nd birthday. “Blue!” “Apple!” “Dog!” Some words she’d not fully say or annunciate: green-“geen”, banana-“nana”

About two weeks ago she started talking to “someone”. Not just words tho. Although it wasn’t in the form of perfectly structured sentences, it was more thought out than usual.

Well, actually at first it didn’t throw me off too much. I would hear “night-night” coming from her room. I figured that she was just interested in mimicking what I had told her about 15 minutes earlier. That’s common for children learning to talk.

But then she would say “no”. She said it as if she was responding to a question. This still was not too crazy tho. She could have an imaginary friend. Every kid does, right?

The first time it scared me was when I went in her room to check on her after hearing a bump on the wall. She said, “Daddy, don’t turn on the light. He doesn’t like it.”

Usually I would be proud to hear my daughter’s vocabulary advance so much in such a short amount of time but this creeped me out. Her room was pitch black. I asked, “who is ‘he?’”


She pointed to the far corner of the ceiling. “He wears your face.” She said.

I forced myself to laugh. Kids say such strange things.

That night I slept on the floor next to her bed.

At 2:38, she sat straight up in bed and whispered, “He’s right behind you.”

I didn’t turn around. I was petrified.

Strange happenings have continues to happen since that night. We tried everything. First I moved her bed into my room. The strange happenings continued to happen. Just her waking up and saying some off putting things. It troubled me so I just started letting her sleep in my bed.

One night she sat up and began screaming until she vomited and began yelling “NO NO NO! DONT HANG ME!” While clawing at the air above her head.

She had never heard the word “hang”.

I called a pediatrician. They said night terrors. I called a therapist. They said stress. I called my pastor. He came over and began praying but left early because lily kept whispering his childhood nickname. One that only his mother, who had passed away 16 years ago, had called him.

I saged the house. I burned incense. I put crosses up. I took them down when Lily ripped one off the wall and screamed like it burned her.

After that she stopped sleeping entirely. She would just sit there all night repeating the phrase “almost done.”

She started correcting me.

One night I said, “Daddy loves you more than anything.”

She shook her head.

“No,” she said “He loves me more.”

I asked who “he” was.

She looked confused.

“The one who lives in your shadow.” She said, as if the answer was obvious.

What happened earlier tonight is what led me to make this post. As if what I’ve already been going through wasn’t enough.

I was rocking her in the living room when she went completely still. Too still. She smiled. A real smile. The first one in days.

“Daddy,” she said, “he says thank you for letting him in.”

I asked what she meant. She leaned close to my ear and whispered “You invited him when you wrote about him.”

I froze. I’ve never posted about this. Not anywhere. Not until now.

She pulled back, eyes unfocused, voice deeper than it should be. “He’s been lonely since you stopped believing.”

Then the lights went out.

I’m typing this on my phone in the dark. Lily is asleep on the couch, finally peaceful.

But I can see something standing at the end of the hallway.

It looks like me.

It’s smiling.

And my daughter just rolled over and said, without opening her eyes “Don’t worry, Daddy. When he’s done with me, he says he’ll come back for you.”

If anyone has ANY advice, please respond.
I don’t think I have much time.
