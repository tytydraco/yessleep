He was always so petrified. He used to climb into bed with my wife and me every night. “Mummy, Daddy, I’m afraid of the dark.” This had become a routine. We tried everything—lying in bed with him until he fell asleep, night lights, teddy bears—nothing worked. I tried to convince my wife on many occasions to just let him sleep with us at night, but she refused and said it was a phase; we had to be consistent.

This habit broke when we decided to move from our two-bedroom flat into our first real home. We had been saving for this home for almost ten years, and it was everything we had dreamed of: real wood flooring, rooms so spacious that if you yelled, it would echo, and a huge back garden. The first night we went to bed, I was sure our son would climb into bed with us. I was stunned when we didn’t wake up until 9am, and he was still asleep.

I sat at the table, sipping my morning coffee and reading the paper when he came toddling downstairs.
“Good morning, buddy! I see you slept all night in your big boy bed by yourself!” I couldn’t contain my excitement. It may sound ridiculous, but I was worried this would go on forever.

He let out a little chuckle, “Don’t be silly, Daddy, I wasn’t alone.”

I was instantly confused. Did my wife sneak into his room and sleep with him? Did he get into our bed and then go back in the morning? “What do you mean, son? I didn’t hear you once.”

“My friend was with me,” he said with a huge grin on his face. “Daddy, can I watch Bluey while eating breakfast this morning?” he innocently asked, giving puppy dog eyes.

“No, son, we’ve just got that sofa, and I don’t want it covered in eggs.” Suddenly, what he had said a moment before dawned on me. “Son, what friend?” I asked, puzzled.

“My friend!” he smiled. “Please, Dad! I won’t get eggs anywhere, I promise!” he begged.

“Not today, little one, your mum would go crazy at me. Maybe tomorrow.”

“Awhhh,” he frowned, slumping down at the table. He began munching his breakfast, eating as fast as he could so he wouldn’t miss the new episode.

Later that day, I spoke to my wife and told her about what our child had said earlier. She told me not to overthink it; if anything, it’s a good thing that he has an imaginary friend, especially if it helps him go to sleep. I agreed and continued with his bedtime routine.

I couldn’t believe it when I woke up, and he wasn’t sandwiched between us for the second night in a row. Again, I went downstairs to have my coffee and read my newspaper. Suddenly, he came flying down the stairs. “Daddy, can we go to the park today?” he said, as if he had just come up with the greatest idea ever.

“Of course we can,” I laughed slightly, “especially since you slept all alone again.”

He looked at me, confused. “Daddy, I’ve told you, I’m not alone. My friend is with me.”

I decided to entertain him. “Oh yeah? What does this friend look like?”

His face brightened up again. “I can’t see much of his face because he only comes out of the wardrobe when it’s dark. He has a big smile and long fingernails. He taps them on the edge of the bed to help me sleep.”

Needless to say, I was slightly disturbed. That sounded terrifying to me, but kids are imaginative and say all kinds of crazy things. “Wow, he sounds cool. What’s his name?”

“He told me not to tell you,” he sang in a cheeky way, as if he thought it was funny that I wasn’t allowed to be in on the secret.

“Come on, tell me, and I’ll let you watch Bluey while you eat your breakfast today,” I smirked, thinking I had won the war.

“Really?!” he exclaimed. Then suddenly, he paused. His face went blank. He turned around and looked towards the ajar coat room that was in the hallway separating the kitchen and living room. He turned back around, lowered his head, “I can’t tell you, Daddy,” he said, sounding rather disappointed.

He hopped up to the kitchen table, looking defeated, and started eating his toast. I won’t lie—I got kind of freaked out. I peered into the hallway, into the cloakroom; nothing seemed amiss. It was dark, as it needed a lightbulb, but nothing out of the ordinary. My wife’s words ran through my head: this was a good thing.

That night, he was rather tuckered out from his day at the park. My wife and I were excited to have a full night together and were going to make the most of it, eating junk food in bed while watching a movie—something we hadn’t been able to do since our son was born. Suddenly, all the fizzy pop hit me, and I got up to go to the bathroom. I hopped out of bed and made my way to the bathroom. I thought maybe I’d check on our little man and his “friend” on the way. I placed my hand on the door knob, and my blood ran cold. Before I got a chance to open the door, I heard tap, tap, tap. It sounded just like nails on wood.
