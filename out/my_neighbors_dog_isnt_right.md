my neighbors dog isnt right.

I'm a 28 year old male I have a dog named kloe, have no close family, and I live in the suburbs. Until just recently I have been a normal 9-5 type of guy working, eating, sleeping. Around spring of last year my new neighbor had moved in a, 32 year old female and a dog named Milo. When I tell you that this dog is shaped like no other I mean it. I asked, let's just call her kylie, what type of dog it was and she said it was a Saint Bernard. Automatically I sensed something was off because I've seen those dogs before and they didn't look like hers. But I just brushed it off like it was nothing and went back home. 

The next morning I go went for a jog with kloe through the park. While I was waiting for kloe to do her business I see kylie and Milo. We exchange a conversation and pet each others dogs, at that moment while petting kylies dog I realized how thick and weird it's fur felt, kylie said that it has a rare condition. By that time I felt like it was time to go home.

 After that encounter we hadn't really seen or talked to each other, but suddenly kylie invites me and kloe for dinner so that "the dogs can get to know each other" me being tired of eating insta-meals I agree. Me and kloe arrive next door and kylie greets us while milo sits in the background. While I'm waiting for dinner to be made I'm petting milo and kloe while talking to kylie, then milo rolls over to lay down and I start rubbing his belly and feel something.. out of place it feels like a zipper like from a jacket. I decide to keep my mouth shut wondering what's the worst that can happen. Me and kylie are eating when I notice kloe is acting strange around milo, so we go home.

 While I'm getting ready to go to sleep I see something from my window it's kylies bathroom I take a glance and see milo, but something wasn't right in a brief moment I watched as a man unzips from the dog which used to be milo. and I'm petrified, in a brief moment of fear I run to kylies door and bang on it.. but no response I do it again.. but no response. I look in the window to see what happened and there it is there's "milo" standing above kylies cold dead body. I'm too stunned to do anything so I slowly walk back inside thinking about what I just saw locked every door in the house and went to sleep.

 The next morning the cops knocked on my door and questioned me about the body.. I lied.. "I saw nothing officer" deep down I knew.. I knew everything but I zoned out as I watched "milo" in the dog suit roaming around the neighborhood. It's been a year since that happened and I still haven't told anyone about this experience until now.
