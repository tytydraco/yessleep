When Olivia disappeared, my life ended.

I came home from work to an empty house. Her car was still in the driveway. Her phone was on the kitchen counter. Her coat was hanging by the door. It was like she had just stepped out for a moment—but she never came back.

For the next two years, I searched. I went on local news. I printed hundreds of missing person posters. I stood outside grocery stores, handing out flyers with her face, begging people to call if they had seen her.

But no one had.

And then last night, I came home and found her sitting at the kitchen table.

Like she had never left.

I stood frozen in the doorway. My keys slipped from my fingers, clattering to the floor.

She looked up at me, smiling like it was any other night. “Hey, babe.”

My throat went dry. My chest tightened. I couldn’t breathe.

It was her. Same auburn hair. Same tired but loving eyes. Same navy blue sweater she had been wearing the day she disappeared.

I took a shaky step forward. “O-Olivia?”

She tilted her head. “Yeah?”

I swallowed, my body trembling. “Where the hell have you been?”

Her smile faded. “What do you mean?”

I grabbed my phone, fingers fumbling as I scrolled through my photos, my missing person posters, the articles, the police reports. I held the screen up to her. “You’ve been gone for two years. Look!”

She took my phone and frowned.

Then she flipped it around.

The screen was blank.

No photos. No posters. No trace of my desperate search.

Nothing.

I grabbed the phone from her, shaking. I scrolled through my texts, my emails—every single one was gone.

She reached out and touched my hand.

“Babe, you’re scaring me,” she whispered.

I yanked away from her touch. “This isn’t real. You’re not real.”

She just stared at me, expression unreadable. Then, in the softest voice, she asked:

“Did you stop taking your medication again?”

I barely slept that night.

She crawled into bed beside me, warm and familiar, draping an arm over my chest. She smelled like she always had. She felt like she always had.

But she wasn’t supposed to be here.

I stayed awake, staring at the ceiling, listening to her breathe.

In the morning, I told her we needed to go to the police.

She rolled her eyes but agreed.

We sat in the station, waiting. My hands were clenched into fists. Olivia just looked bored, scrolling through her phone.

The officer called us in. I stood. Olivia didn’t.

“Aren’t you coming?” I asked.

She blinked at me. “Why would I?”

I swallowed hard. “Because you were missing, Olivia.”

She sighed and looked at the officer. “He’s been… struggling,” she said softly. “Ever since my accident.”

My stomach twisted. “What accident?”

The officer frowned. “Sir, are you feeling okay?”

I turned to him, desperate. “This is my wife. She vanished two years ago! I—”

But he was shaking his head.

“She was never missing.”

I felt the air leave my lungs. “What…?”

He tapped his computer screen, rotating it toward me.

It was a hospital discharge report. My name. A date from two years ago.

Psychiatric hospitalization. Schizophrenic episode.

Delusional disorder.

I felt like I was drowning. I turned to Olivia, but she just gave me that soft, familiar smile.

“I never left,” she whispered.

I stumbled out of the station, my head spinning. I grabbed my phone, searching for anything to prove I wasn’t insane.

The missing posters. The police reports. The frantic Facebook posts I had made.

They were gone.

I turned to Olivia.

She reached for my hand.

“You remember now, don’t you?” she whispered.

And for the first time, I did.

Flashes of memories.

Not of Olivia disappearing—but of me losing control.

The late nights, screaming into the void. The hallucinations. The endless panic attacks. The medications I refused to take.

And Olivia. Crying. Begging me to get help.

She never left.

She was never missing.

I was the one who had been gone.
