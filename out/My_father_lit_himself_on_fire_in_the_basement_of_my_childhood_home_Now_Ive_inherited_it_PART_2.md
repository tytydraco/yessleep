Three months before my father kicked us out of the house, I remembered when we had moved in, and I first saw the house. I remembered seeing the study, and how I called it a tower.

“It’s called a turret. If it’s in a house it’s a turret,” my father said.

“Like a gun?”

“It’s a homonym,” he said, eyes unwavering from the road ahead.

I didn’t really get it, but decided he was probably right.

“I like it,” I said. “Can you put my bed up there?” Emma whined from the back seat. “It’s a princess tower! It should be mine!”

“It’s actually a homonym,” I said, looking toward my father.

“It was your grandfather’s office, and I’m planning on continuing that,” he said, eyes still focused ahead.

And for most of my time in the house, that was the most I ever knew about my father’s office at the top of the turret. He worked at the top of the spiralling staircase every day. Forbidding us from ever going up there, even in an emergency. At seven years old I did not have the words or knowledge to call it neglect, so I called it working.

Over the next three months, he spent most of his time up there working. The scarce times he came out, were mostly for the basics. Feeding us, telling us if we were being too loud, etc. The exception was once a month when he would leave in the morning to head into town. 

On these days he would be gone for the entire day, and my siblings and I would take advantage of this fact. Playing games outside our rooms or playing hide and seek across the entire house.

I had only dared wait to see my father return a couple of times, staying up far past my bedtime. On those rare occasions, I would hear him drag all the boxes and garbage bags past my room, up the stairs, and into his office. Even rarer, I only ever waited at the bottom of my bedroom door once, peeking through the small crack to catch a glimpse of what he was doing. Three months after we had first moved in. My last day in the house.

It was hot. The whippoorwills and woodcocks called, through the humid summer heat, making me feel as if I was suffocating. Birdsong filled my ears, while the hot air choked my lungs. 

The day had been unremarkable otherwise, with none of my siblings having any motivation to play in the heat. So, I was bored. And with that boredom, I decided that I was going to figure out what my father went into town to get once a week, even if it was just a peek.

So, I waited, fighting against everything to stay awake. After what seemed like hours, my effort finally paid off, and my father returned. I watched him slowly drive down the long gravel driveway and roll to a stop at the front of the house.

He hefted the garbage bag from the bed of the truck with what looked like considerable effort and quickly maneuvered to the front door. Once he was inside, I silently crept to the bottom of my door. It was only a couple of seconds before I heard him again. He had given up on carrying the bag, now dragging it behind him down the hall.

It felt like forever. Crouched on the hard wooden floorboards with my face pressed painfully against the edge of the door, it couldn’t have been more than a few seconds. And as I saw my father shuffle into my view, dragging the black garbage bag behind him that long awful moment stretched even longer.

My father passed by my view, his leather shoes wet and slick. Then came the garbage bag, black and taunt. Its contents bulged out from inside it, begging the plastic to tear and release it from my father. As time seemed to slow, the bag stared back at me. Or whatever was in the bag did.

My father was not alone though.  After his leather shoes and the bag, next came his guest. Bare feet, wrinkled and muddy, walked calmly after him. Each toenail lay atop a layer of dirt and fungus, following my father without regard for what I had seen.

Then, as that eternity ended and the nightmare squelched out of my view, I noticed what my father and his guest had left behind. Blood. A long smear followed him up the turret and into his study. 

I never went to bed after that, and before I could run away or tell the police that my dad was a murderer, I was kicked out at only seven years old. Sent to live with a far-off aunt. Only reconnecting with my siblings years later and learning they had similar fates. Each of them sent away to different branches of the family tree. 

Now, staring out the window, seeing his grave excavated I had confirmation that what I saw was real. That something about the house — my father — was wrong.

I knew what I had to do. Grabbing the garbage bags from the kitchen, I went back to the porch, propped open the door, and started roughly sweeping and spilling all the “gifts” I had received from my neighbours into them.  In my seventeen years away from home, I’d never been one for religion, but I respected it. However, this was different. Whatever cult my father had been a part of, and had now dragged me into, I was not going to be a part of it.

Spilling the bag’s contents into the fireplace, I knew I wouldn’t need to search for where my father had stored the kindling. Instantly, and almost eagerly, the fire engulfed the various dreamcatchers, idols, and effigies. 

That was the first problem addressed and if any neighbours keen to espouse their faith came along when I was at home, that problem would be addressed too. Violently if required. The problem of my father miraculously deciding to come back from hell and make my life worse was another. I walked to the end of the property where the grave now sat empty and waiting, the woods that surrounded the edges full of loud birdsong and calls.

Where first I had expected shovels, boot prints, and a clean excavation, what now sat in front of me was far more worrying.

It wasn’t clean. Nothing about it was clean. Not unlike the front porch, the grave was cluttered. Feathers and splintered wood surrounded it on all sides. The hole was equally weird. It was open sure but unlike a grave you’d find in a cemetery. It wasn’t neat or orderly, but rough and jagged. Instead of the dirt being piled next to the hole, the walls drifted in.

As if it wasn’t someone digging down to reach my father, but my father digging up to escape the earth. The last thing that caught my eye pushed me over the edge.

Ashen footprints, burned into the grass crawled out from the hole. Walking towards the woods.

*Nope.*

I only saw two options. One: Linda, Paul, Clark, and probably the rest of the town were insane. Or two: my father had decided to make a posthumous appearance at the family reunion in all his burnt awfulness. Not that those two were mutually exclusive. I was pretty sure that Linda would make me into a pot pie for the next of my siblings to inherit the house if given the opportunity.

Still, I didn’t exactly like either option. I wouldn’t be walking into any giant burning wooden statues or seeing my father again any time soon if I had it my way.

The house was probably safe. And the study had answers. 

*I could leave now. Pack my stuff, rip out the driveway, and never come back.*

I went back inside and up the staircase.

*I have to see it.*

\*\*\*

There were no taxidermied heads on the shelves. No obvious bloody pentagrams on the floor. All things considered, I might have almost felt disappointed. Seventeen years of expectations and it looked like a normal study.

Like the rest of the house, every wall of the circular room was lined with bookshelves. There were a few end tables with lamps and knickknacks on them, and a couch, but in the middle of the room was a large wooden desk.

Desk was the wrong word. It might’ve been one once, but it seemed to have been repurposed into something else. Cleared of everything to allow for space, old dark stains and deep gouges covered the surface. The red stains flowed from the table onto the floorboards, and I saw that the entire room was similarly marked. I then realized, it wasn’t just the floor and the desk. Every inch of wood was bloodstained, deepened to a dark brown with age. 

On the desk remained only one thing: a single sheet of paper. Written on it in heavy, dried ink were a few words. It wasn’t long, only a couple sentences, but that didn’t mean each word didn’t stretch on.

*“Your great-great-great-grandfather fed it first. He found it in the woods, and it gave him miracles. So, it was only fair when he gave it himself and his family. That was the deal. We feed it; it feeds on us. Now it is your turn.*

*Starve it, Thomas. Let it starve. If not for me, for you. For your family who comes next. 17 years it has starved. I sent you away so it would. And now I bring you back so it will. I will let it starve in me and in you.”*

I didn’t touch the note. It would’ve felt wrong. Had he kicked us out to protect us? Was he just corrupted by whatever it was he was trying to feed?

A part of me wanted deep down to believe my father was a good man. To take this note and the cult as a sign he was manipulated. Or maybe he was just awful. Selfish enough to sacrifice his son to achieve his goal. Enough of a bastard to move us to a deathtrap cult.

Still, the blazing fireplace full of offerings and my dad's recent return to the land of the living were damning. I knew something strange was going on, and no matter my opinions of the man, he was warning me. 

As much as it pained me to agree with him, I would stay. If only for a small while.

\*\*\*

The garbage bag of meat, bread, and various crafts made from human detritus landed at the far end of the study. I bent over in the middle trying to catch my breath. If I had anything positive to look forward to, the developing six-pack from my daily workout of lugging the offerings up the tower was it. 

I looked across the room at my two weeks of work. The pile had easily grown as tall as me. Every day, multiple times a day, my neighbours would make their deliveries. At first, it was much of the same: home-cooked meals, rotting meat, and handcrafted idols.

The longer my charade continued, however, the more things escalated. From what I had heard in our brief interactions, small unfortunes were happening around town. Power outages, crop failures, personal injuries, and even deaths in the family. All were placed upon me. And with that, more serious offerings. Freshly butchered livestock, home-cooked casserole, and family heirlooms. Someone had even brought their three-year-old son. I was able to convince them to change their mind on that one. Barely.

I looked again at the blasphemous pile. I would have to figure out some other place to store the junk they kept giving me. The basement would work, but the smell hadn’t departed yet. Eerily, that wasn’t the only place I’d smelled it. On the few days, I’d left the house or opened a window, I could catch it on the wind. I’d stopped opening and started locking the windows after that.

As I descended the turret, I looked out the windows absentmindedly and my heart dropped. Paying attention, I could hear the birdsong from my childhood again. Now though, I knew its source.

Chances were, Linda and Paul were outside. I thought I could see Clark. I couldn’t see all of him, but someone who looked his size was kneeling in the long grass surrounding the manor. Even if it wasn’t him, dozens of others were arranged similarly around the house.

Every window I passed going down the turret, quickened my descent. I could see someone outside each one. Some had their hands stretched into the sky, others bowed low to the ground. It had to be the entire town. They had made a circle. A wall around the house. They were all singing in birdsong.

I sprinted down the stairs. If they got in, I had no idea what they’d do to me. All I knew was that they were crazy enough for me to be worried. 

The back door was locked, I remember that, same with the windows. The front door though, I couldn’t remember. As I exited the turret and bolted down the hall, I prayed with everything I had that I locked it.

Turning the corner and placing my hand on the brass door handle, for a single second I was filled with relief. It was locked.

Knock Knock.

The door handle slowly turned in my hand. It was imperceptible, so slow that to tell someone was trying to get it, you would have to feel it twisting dreadfully in your hand. And I did. Whoever was turning the handle had the strength of the world, a force of nature

Again, it came. Knock knock knock.

The scent of the basement seeped from beneath the door. Fresh now, the sickly-sweet odour hurt my nose. Its noxious rancid smoke bringing tears to my eyes with its foulness. I panicked for a second trying to find the peephole to see the other side and remembered it didn’t exist. I was blind to whatever was behind the door.

Knock knock.

I had to get out of here. That was a long shot though, even with a plan. Lucky for me, I could feel one forming. I prepared myself.

It was twilight when I was ready. The boarded windows, not even allowing moonlight inside. I unlocked the front door and bolted. Running back across the now dark house.

My childhood bedroom door was already open; I couldn’t waste any time. Closing it behind me, I squatted to the floor. The summer heat hotter than any night in my childhood. The birdsong so much louder now than any time before. I waited for my guest.

The door opened. I could hear the footsteps slowly shuffling down the hallway. Passing the door in a few seconds, I only caught a glimpse of the feet. Burnt and charred, leaving blackened prints. Then they were gone, right up the stairs. He knew the way.

As soon as they were up the turret, I bolted out of my room locking the front door. Placing my steps carefully in the few bare spots of the floor not littered with books. If I went any faster, I’d slip on the gasoline.

I lit the fireplace.

The living room went up in flames immediately. The explosion of heat sent me flying across the room, hitting my head on the far wall.

Stars filled my view. Every inch of the old house was ablaze. Embers drifted onto me, burning my skin and threatening to ignite my clothes. It was hard to hear over the roar of the fire, but the birdsong had stopped, now replaced by furious knocks from every wall of the house.

The windows shattered, whether from the heat inside or my neighbours outside.  The boards held though, and any attempts at breaking through were stopped with the lick of flames. He wasn’t leaving the house. He was going to burn. I’d finish my father’s work.

Smoke burned my lungs. The room was filling with nowhere for it to go. I choked on the heat, coughing as I blindly stumbled through the house towards my escape route. I hoped with the frenzy of fire, I would be able to slip out unnoticed. If not, I’d fight my way through. Then, I heard it. Through the roar of flame and collapsing of home, it was deafening in comparison.

His footsteps echoed down the stairs. I stabilized myself and waited as he descended.

Seventeen years ago, when he had kicked me out, he had never said anything to me. He had never said goodbye. I hadn’t either.

I didn’t even remember what the last words I had said to him were.

Silhouette vague from the inferno around him, I took his form in. The fire and smoke didn’t allow for much visibility, but I could see parts of him. He was burnt. Some of that from when he was alive, some from whatever he was now. One of his arms had fallen off, the waxy fat dripping to the floor in clumps. An alien limb had grown in its place. A small skinny thing with hardened skin ending in four digits, each pointed with a talon. Small needles of burnt away feathers grew out of his flesh. 

I couldn’t see my father’s face. The smoke and heat obscured it. I could tell it was changed. No longer human, but still unrecognizably my father.

I smiled. Not for him. Not really.

I said nothing.
