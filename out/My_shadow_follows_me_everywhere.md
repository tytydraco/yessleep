I’ve always been afraid of the dark.

I know what you’re thinking, but it’s not like that. My fear isn’t in the typical way that most people are afraid. It’s not about monsters under the bed or things that go bump in the night. My fear is more specific than that. Probably more pathetic, really. I’m afraid of my own shadow.

I know how it sounds. Believe me, I’ve heard every joke, every dismissive comment you can come up with. I tried talking to my family, my partners, I even tried therapy, and they all chalked it up to some irrational fear or some manifestation of self-loathing as my therapist so delinquently put it. 

They’re all wrong.

It started when I was seven. I remember the exact moment because it was my birthday party, and my parents had rented one of those inflatable bounce houses for me and my friends. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across our backyard. Me and my friends had eaten too much cake and ice cream and were utilizing the last minutes of time we had with the bounce house. I was laughing, trying to do some dumb flip to show off when I looked down.

That’s the first time I saw it. 

My shadow was facing the wrong direction.

I froze, mid-jump and suspended in air for what felt like an eternity, but was probably only seconds, staring at the dark silhouette beneath me. Everyone else’s shadow stretched toward the fence, away from the dying sun. The way shadows were supposed to stretch. Mine pointed directly at me, like it was reaching up instead of being cast down.

When I landed, it snapped back to normal. I blinked, and it was fine, elongated toward the fence like everyone else’s, perfectly ordinary. I convinced myself I’d imagined it. I didn’t know anything about how shadows were supposed to work. Besides, seven-year-olds have active imaginations, right?

But then it happened again two weeks later. I was walking home from school, and I noticed my shadow lagging behind me. Not by much, maybe only half a step. But it was enough that when I stopped walking, it took a fraction of a second longer to stop too.

I started paying attention after that. Obsessively.

Most of the time, my shadow behaved normally. It did what shadows are supposed to do, it followed the rules of light and physics and all that rational, scientific shit that should have made me feel better but didn’t. Because every so often, maybe once a month, sometimes less, it would do something that felt off.

It would move independently, just for a second. Whether it be a twitch of the hand when mine were still, a tilt of the head when I was looking straight ahead, or a step that was just a fraction of a second too behind. Small things. Blink and you’ll miss it things.

Things that made me feel insane.

I learned to avoid certain lighting by the time I was on my own. Those overhead annoying fluorescent lights were the worst, they made my shadow pool directly beneath me, dense and dark, and I swear I could feel it watching me. Sounds ridiculous right? I started walking close to thewalls, staying in that kind of light where shadows got muddy and indistinct. I bought blackout curtains. I even stopped going outside after 4 PM in the winter, because the sun hung low and shadows stretched grotesque across the pavement.

My life became smaller and smaller, carved around the shape of my fear.

For years, I managed. I built a routine that minimized shadow exposure, and I almost convinced myself I was handling it. I got good at making excuses; I work night shifts, I’m sensitive to light, I prefer indoor activities. I would say anything to avoid my own shadow. And then, eventually, people stopped asking questions.

But three months ago, something changed.

I was at a coffee shop, a rare daytime outing because I’d run out of my medication and needed to get the refill before the pharmacy closed. The café had those big industrial windows, and the afternoon sun was streaming through, cutting harsh rectangular shadows across the floor. I was standing off to the side, staring at the menu board while I waited for my drink. 

That’s when I felt it.

That prickling awareness on the back of my neck, the goosebumps. That fight or flight sensation of being watched.

I looked down.

My shadow was facing me.

Not twisted around or pointing the wrong direction like when I was seven. It was standing in front of me, upright, head tilted up as if making eye contact, even though shadows don’t have eyes. They don’t have faces. They’re not supposed to have any features at all.

But I swear to god, mine was looking right at me.

I stumbled backward, knocking into the person behind me. They said something annoyed, but I couldn’t hear them over the rushing in my ears. When I looked down again, my shadow was normal. Behind me, where the light source dictated it should be. 

The barista called my name three times before I registered it.

I went home and didn’t leave again for two weeks. That’s when I started noticing it in my apartment too. In the lamplight, in the glow from my laptop screen, even in the faint illumination my phone gave off at night. My shadow started showing up where it shouldn’t.

On walls I wasn’t facing. In mirrors, moving in my peripheral vision. Once, I saw it in the kitchen when I was in the bedroom, a clear, distinct silhouette passing across the wall like someone walking through a room.

I stopped turning on lights unless absolutely necessary. I bought more blackout curtains., started sleeping during the day and staying awake at night because darkness felt safer than the unreliable shadows cast by artificial light.

And it was great, at first. Because the thing about darkness is, you can’t have shadows without light. That’s what I thought. That’s what I was counting on.

I was wrong.

Last week, I woke up at 3 AM. My room was pitch black. There was no streetlights through my many blackout curtains, no electronics glowing, absolutely nothing. No light. The kind of dark where you can’t even see your hand in front of your face.

And as my eyes adjusted I saw my shadow on the wall.

Impossible right? That’s what I thought too. There’s no light source. Shadows can’t exist without light. That’s like, basic physics or whatever. That’s just how the world works.

But there it was. Darker than the surrounding darkness, which shouldn’t be possible but was. A human shaped boid of nothingness standing next to my bed, perfectly still.

I didn’t move, couldn’t even breathe. I just stared at it, and it stared back. That was when I realized something, with horrible certainty, that it had never needed light at all. The light was for my benefit, to trick me, to disguise what it really was. To make it seem normal and explainable so I wouldn’t question it. 

In the complete absence of light, I could finally see it clearly.

It wasn’t my shadow. It had never been my shadow.

It was something else, something that had been following me since I was seven, disguising itself as the natural phenomenon of a shadow. Hiding in plain sight.

I’ve been sitting here in my dark room for six days now. I haven’t eaten. Haven’t slept. I’m typing this on my phone with the brightness turned all the way down, and I refuse to look away from the screen because I’m terrified of what I’ll see.

But the thing is, I can feel it in here with me. In the corner. By the door. Sometimes right next to me, close enough that it feels like that particular warmth of a body next to you…except shadows don’t radiate temperature. 

I don’t know what it wants. I don’t know why it chose me. I don’t know if it’s been waiting all these years for me to finally acknowledge it, to see it for what it really is.

But I can hear it now.

Not with my ears, it doesn’t make any real sound. But I can hear it the way you hear your own thoughts, like it’s speaking directly into my brain.

It’s saying the same thing, over and over:

“Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.”

And the worst part about it, the part that’s made me finally decide to post this before I do what I know I’m going to do, is that I want to look. There’s something almost seductive about it, something that makes me want to turn my head and meet its gaze directly, even though I know with absolute certainty that if I do, I won’t be me anymore.

I’ll be it.

Or maybe it’ll be me.

Maybe that has always been the goal, and if I look, maybe I’ll understand why it’s been following me all these years. Why it chose me.

My phone battery is at 3%. When it dies, I’ll be in complete darkness again.

And I think this time, I’m going to look.

I’m going to turn my head and stare directly at the thing that’s been with me my entire life, and I’m going to finally understand what I am.

What we are.

If you’re reading this, and you’ve ever felt like your shadow wasn’t quite right, if it’s moved wrong, or lingered too long, or been somewhere it shouldn’t…

Don’t look at it.

Whatever you do, don’t acknowledge it.

Because once you see it, once you really see it, it sees you too.

And then it’s only a matter of time.
