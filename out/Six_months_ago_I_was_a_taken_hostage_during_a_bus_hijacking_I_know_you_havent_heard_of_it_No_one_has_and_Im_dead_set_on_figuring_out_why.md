*“Sit the* ***fuck*** *down,”* he growled, lifting his pistol at the college-aged kid, firearm trembling in his skeletal hand.

The rest of the captives, myself included, observed the exchange with bated breath.

Before, we had just been passengers. A group of unconnected travelers, drifting over the rocky plains and the sand dunes of southwest Arizona together, waiting patiently for the cramped bus to arrive at a mutual destination. Ten minutes after we departed, however, the lone hijacker stood up from the seat closest to the door and revealed his weapon. As he did, we found ourselves connected in the worst way possible.

None of us understood why.

I prayed that kid’s dumb courage could untangle our rapidly entwining fates, changing us back to simply a group of unconnected travelers before something terrible happened. Judging by the demographics of us captives - predominantly under the age of 10 or over the age of 50 - he was the best shot we had.

And so I watched, dread hanging heavy in my heart.

*“Take it easy, man. There are children on board. You see that, right? You gotta put the gun down.”*

The hijacker said nothing in response.

Instead, he coldly shook his head no, leaning his shoulder against a steel pole directly behind the driver for support.

In his right hand, he held a silver nine-millimeter pistol. In the other, he held something I had trouble identifying. A noisy green box about the size of a matchbook. It ticked like a metronome, beeping rhythmically in his palm every few seconds. Two tubes containing a slightly cloudy, colorless liquid ran from the side of the box, over his wrist, and up into the darkness of the man’s sleeve.

I incorrectly assumed it was a bomb.

*“Turn right at the fork - then, in six miles, turn left,”* a muffled robotic voice cooed from within his jacket pocket.

He briefly took his eyes off the kid, tilting his head around to say something to the driver.

Then, that lionhearted son of a bitch started sprinting down the aisle.

I understand *why* he believed he could overwhelm the hijacker. Visually, it sort of made sense. Their physiques couldn’t have been more opposite. The kid was in his prime. Muscular, but not so muscular that the weight slowed him down. A youthful fire behind his eyes. He progressed towards his target with a certain predatory grace, like a jaguar prowling in the shade of the underbrush, closing in on injured prey.

The hijacker, in comparison, looked to be on death’s door.

He had a pair of dull blue eyes sunken deep in their sockets. Brittle patches of brown hair asymmetrically planted across his scalp, with islands of wilted skin peeking through where the flesh was most barren. The man was downright cadaverous; inhumanly emaciated. Couldn’t have been over ninety pounds soaking wet, and that’s including the weight of his oversized denim jacket and dark black chinos. He was like a stick figure that had been granted life through a child’s dying wish, jumping off the page into a world too harsh for his pencil-drawn proportions, composed of nothing more than a torso with sewing needle arms held up by a pair of toothpick legs and a shriveled head dangling on top of it all.

The only advantage the hijacker had was the gun. Even so, it appeared like he was struggling to hold the pistol upright. His hand barely had the strength.

I suppose the odds felt even.

In the blink of an eye, the kid had closed the distance. He was quick. Swift but powerful. Maybe he ran cross-country. The hijacker barely had time to react.

Hope dug its roots into my chest. I felt my body reflexively rise from my seat. I was only three rows behind the driver.

*The kid will probably need help wrestling the gun away from him,* I thought.

Before I could even get into the aisle, though, something went wrong.

Impossibly wrong.

He angled his approach so that his chest collided with the hijacker’s back. I guess he aimed to thread his brawny arms through the man’s armpits, thereby immobilizing him and controlling the direction the firearm was pointed at, to some degree.

But as soon as he connected with the hijacker’s body, it liquefied. Along with the gun, the ticking box, and his clothes.

I know how it sounds, and it’s OK. You’re allowed to harbor some skepticism.

Bear with me and try to keep an open mind.

So, he melted. His skin tone bled together with the colors of his clothes, pallid beige swirling together with navy and black, homogenizing into earth-colored gelatin that crawled over the kid’s frame. It  practically glided. Creeped over his shoulders, between his legs, around his torso until it was all behind him. Made it look easy.

Then he reformed. De-congealed back into a person. Reintegrated the clothes, the box, and the gun, too.

The hijacker placed the butt of the gun on the small of the kid’s back, angled it slightly upward, and pulled the trigger.

Three explosions. A crack of thunder in triplicate. Sprays of blood and bone. Screams from the passengers - the high-pitched shrieks of children and the more sonorous wails of their parents. And behind it all, I could still hear the ticking of that tiny box. Slightly faster, but otherwise unbothered by its dissolution and reformation.

I couldn’t look away. Even as that kid fell into a heap, mangled body crumpling to the floor aside the driver, I couldn’t blink.

The man swung around, panting and sweating like a Great Dane in the summer sun. Tears had welled under his eyes. His gaze darted between the kid’s corpse, the hysterical passengers, and back again. For a moment, his features betrayed remorse.

But that moment didn’t last.

His ragged breathing slowed. His face hardened. He straightened himself, and, somehow; he looked taller. It wasn’t by a lot - a few inches maybe - but it was noticeable. Like his reintegration hadn’t been precise, just very approximate.

He pointed the gun at the crowd and formally introduced himself.

*“My name is Apollo. Where I need to go isn’t more than an hour down the road. When we get close, I’ll allow one of you to phone the police. ”*

The green box began ticking slightly faster. From every few seconds to every other second. The sound reminded me of a submarine’s radar detecting a rapidly approaching torpedo.

*“Most of you will live as long as you do as I say.”*

\- - - - -

I’d like to address the elephant in the room. Some of you are probably asking yourselves:

*“Is this real? When did this happen? Why haven’t I heard about it already?”*

To start, the event I’m describing occurred a little over six months ago.

As for why you’ve never heard about it, well, that part I’m still figuring out.

Because of *nobody’s* heard about it. There wasn’t *any* news coverage.

To my complete and utter shock, not a single outlet reported on a cryptic bus hijacking orchestrated by an unhinged individual that included the death of a male, white, college aged kid, who was killed attempting to be a hero. Hate to sound cynical about the state of American media, but I don’t know *any* news director that wouldn’t look at the story the same way they’d look at a juicy T-bone steak or scantily clad reality TV star.

They’re positively *ravenous* for this type of thing.

I would know. I used to be a journalist, a damn good one too, until I was blacklisted from the industry for trying to publish an op-ed on the experience.

But hey, who needs conventional media outlets anymore?

We live in the age of the internet.

\- - - - -

Apollo spent the next handful of minutes reorganizing us.

Men to the front of the bus, women and children to the back. At the outset, it wasn’t clear which category was safer to be in. Not looking to be gunned down like the kid, we didn’t ask questions: we just all complied with his request. Urgently shuffled past each other like strangers in an airport.

Once he had five rows of men sequestered up front, Apollo began inspecting them. Looked each one of them up and down with those sunken eyes. All the while, the bus was silent, save for the revving of the engine and the green box, ticking its impatient melody.

Suddenly, the ticking accelerated.

Apollo’s eyes widened. He began hyperventilating. Hungry fear bloomed somewhere within him.

His focus shifted to the road behind us. From his position at the front of the bus, he tilted his head side to side, gaze fixed on a window at the very back of the vehicle.

I turned around in my seat, looked out the same window, and squinted.

But there was nothing.

Initially, I thought he could see the cops in the distance or something, even though we hadn’t been allowed to call them yet.

Not a single car was behind us. Just the desert at twilight, brake lights intermittently revealing the shrubs and cacti lining the backwoods road we were barreling down. Wherever Apollo’s GPS was taking us, it felt far off the beaten path.

He seemed paralyzed. Locked in a state of utter panic as the ticking continued its manic song.

*“Stop the bus…”* he whispered.

The driver, an elderly man in a reflective vest and button-up shirt, did not hear the command.

“**STOP THE BUS,**” Apollo roared.

Tires screeched. I hadn’t braced for impact, so the side of neck collided awkwardly with the seat in front of me. A toddler a few rows back began sobbing uncontrollably. He had been exceptionally stoic until that point, but the sudden stop had demolished the floodgates, and once the tears started following they didn’t show signs of drying up any time soon.

The hijacker’s eyes scanned the captives in front of him. Eventually, they landed on a lean man in his mid-forties with salt-and-pepper hair.

*“You.”* He declared, using the butt of the pistol to indicate who he had selected.

*“Stand up. Now.”*

Reluctantly, the man got to his feet. A jumbled appeal for mercy streamed from his lips.

*“Okay…hey…listen…I have a d-…I have t-two daughters…one of them…is very…is very sick and…”*

Apollo wasn’t listening. His head was down, attention glued to the ticking box. It was hard to tell for certain what *exactly* he was doing. A murky darkness had fallen inside the bus after sunset.

His hands appeared to be fidgeting with the device. Best I could say, I think he loosened one of the tubes containing the cloudy fluid, dabbed some of it onto his finger, and then wiped it onto the salt-and-pepper man’s forehead.

A profane baptism.

The cryptic rite only made the captive plead more feverishly.

*“Y-You…you…I…please, please…”*

*“Get out.”* Apollo responded firmly.

The captive tilted his head. His whole body trembled as he just kept repeating the word *“what”* over and over again. Nuclear levels of confusion seemed to have completely atomized his brain. I almost expected to see a gray-pink brain soup drip from his ears and onto his cheeks.

*“Driver, open the door. Let this man out.”*

The door creaked open.

Hesitantly, the man moved to the aisle. He sheepishly raised his cell phone for Apollo to see. Words had left him at that point, but he still wanted permission to leave with the technology.

The ticking intensified. The beeps had become so fast that they almost melded into a single, ear-piercing sound.

Apollo’s face tightened from some mix of fury and fear.

*“Yes! Yes. Take it. I don’t care. Now get the fuck off the bus.”*

The man finally seized his opportunity. He raced down the aisle and off the vehicle, tripping over the kid’s corpse in his hurry, nearly falling on top of him as he made his escape.

As soon as the doors snapped shut, Apollo shouted his next command.

*“****Drive****.”*

The bus gathered speed. The stunned man disappeared into the blackness, and the singsongy GPS chirped from Apollo’s jacket pocket.

*“Continue straight for another thirty-two miles…”*

The ticking slowed, and Apollo seemed to calm.

*“Your destination will be on your left.”*

\- - - - -

Apollo expelled four more captives that night. Every time, it was the same.

The ticking would speed up. A man would be selected, baptised, and then dismissed. Once they had been left behind, swallowed by the night, the ticking would settle.

It took some detective work, but I’ve determined approximately which road we were driving down. Honestly, it wasn’t as remote as I thought. The nearest town was, give or take, an hour's walk from where most of them had been dropped off.

Five calls were made to the police, reporting the hijacking.

You want to hazard a guess on how many of them were found?

Zero. Zilch. Goose Egg.

All of them vanished without a trace.

I could understand *one or two* of them becoming lost to the wilderness. Killed by a rattlesnake. Or by dehydration. Or heat stroke. The desert isn’t exactly the most hospitable piece of Mother Gaia.

But *all* of them? What are the odds?

Not only that, but none of their remains have ever been located. Not a single scrap of any of them.

To say that fact irked me in the weeks that followed would be an understatement. It drove my mind out to the edge of sanity and kicked it from the car, not unlike Apollo did to those men. Left it to fester in that wasteland without a lifeline.

That said, overtime, I finally started to visualize a perverse logic to it all.

Hear me out.

The men Apollo selected were tall and gaunt. Older. Most of them had brown hair and blue eyes.

I.e. - they all sort of looked like him.

Originally, I theorized he hijacked the vehicle because he needed help getting to wherever that GPS was leading us.

But then, why hijack a whole bus full of people? Why not just hijack a taxi? Better yet, why not just call an Uber?

Those options sure would have been simpler.

Unless, perhaps, he was being chased by something, and he was attempting to slow down its pursuit by throwing a few look-a-likes in its way.

You want to know what I think that mysterious liquid was?

Cerebrospinal fluid. Flowing from his spine, to the device, and then back again. The baptism provided a little part of himself to elevate the authenticity of his doppelgangers.

Which brings me to the most important question. One I still don’t have a satisfactory answer to.

What was that device, and why was it ticking?

\- - - - -

*“****SHOW YOURSELF****”* Apollo screamed.

The green box was ticking faster than it ever had before, like a snare drum tapping at four hundred beats per minute.

He waved the gun around wildly at the frightened passengers.

*“Please…I’m so close. I just need a little more. I can feel it. Why…why stand in the way of my ascension?”*

He was whimpering, nearly crying again.

Eventually, his eyes landed on a young mother sitting aside her son and daughter in the back of the bus.

Apollo charged at her with an imperceptible speed, dropping the ticking box from his left hand so he could pull her from the seat. It swung a few inches above the aisle like a clock pendulum as he put the pistol to her head.

*“Why are you doing this? Haven’t I done* ***enough***?”\*

*”Haven't I proven myself* ***worthy****”?*

His interrogation yielded no answers. It only served to rattle the poor woman to the point of absolute malfunction.

Mostly, what she said was unintelligible. Her sobs were unrelenting. The syllables had been drowned in a river of tears and mucus before they even had a chance to exit her mouth.

However, there was one thing she said that sticks out in my mind. I can hear the words as clear as day.

*“Please spare me and my son.”*

Every time she repeated the phrase, I became more and more aware of the subtle discordance within.

*Why wasn’t she mentioning her daughter?*

That realization had power. Something about it pulled back a veil that was obscuring the presence of an inhuman entity. Subconsciously, I had already peeked behind it, noticing her *”daughter”* in that seat at all.

Now, though, it was fully open.

And when I saw her, or I guess *it*, it saw me back.

The fake child was crawling up the side of the bus like a tarantula. It skittered across the roof until it was directly above Apollo. All the while, it wasn’t watching where it was going.

Its pure white eyes were fixed squarely on my own.

No one else seemed to notice it.

It smiled and slowly pushed a finger to its lips as if to shush me.

My heart exploded against my ribs. I shook my head *no*. Somehow, I knew what was coming.

Despite everything, I wanted it to give Apollo mercy, an emotion I still don’t completely understand.

But he was apparently too far gone. His sins were too irredeemable; his transgressions too foul.

And his punishment was swift.

Its arm grew like stretched taffy until it connected with the base of Apollo’s skull. His head shot up. He clearly felt it.

The ticking continued, faster, and faster, and faster.

*“Eileithyia…I’m begging you…”*

Too little, too late.

Its fingers dug into Apollo’s skin. A muffled scream and a series of gurgles radiated from his slacked jaw. A symphony of tearing flesh spread through the air, popping bone intermixed with ripping muscle and trickling blood.

Eventually, the entity wrenched two separate tubes from the hijacker’s body. One small, one large.

The small tube was the plastic one that had been carrying the cloudy fluid.

The large tube was Apollo’s throat.

It released its grasp, and his corpse slumped to the floor. His skin lost all color, adopting a deep gray tone like uncooked shrimp. Apollo’s features dissolved, too. No eyes, no face, no mouth, no hair. He became a mound of unidentifiable human puddy.

Then, the entity receded from view. Fled into the background like a chameleon changing colors.

Before it completely disappeared, however, it winked at me.

And I can’t stop replaying that moment in my head.

\- - - - -

With Apollo dead, everyone rushed off the bus, weeping and broken. I almost followed them.

Almost.

Call it a hunch, but I knew I needed to look.

Terror swimming through my gut, I stepped out of my seat and tiptoed over to Apollo’s corpse, reached into his jacket pocket, and pulled out his cellphone.

We had been only two miles from whatever his destination was.

I committed the address to memory, slipped the phone back in his pocket, and raced off the bus.

Whatever the truth is, I know I can find it at that address. Which is why I’ve infiltrated the cult that owns that land. Technology is prohibited on their reserve, so I’m not afraid of them finding my post.

But I don’t have anyone to say goodbye to, so I made this instead.

It’s pathetic, I’m aware. Do me a favor though.

If I don’t make it back, please disseminate this story, and the following words, as far as you can.

*Apollo.*

*Eileithyia.*

*The Audience to his Red Nativity.*

There’s something horrific looming on the horizon.

I don’t know if I’m the right person to bring it all to light.

But, hell, I’m going [to try](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/s/2Z6XgouP8j).
