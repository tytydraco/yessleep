After weeks of annoying the police, they finally look inside the building. The fifth floor is empty. No desk, no computers and no account managers. It was a bare office, grey walls, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere like no one was ever here. Those things are out there, luring people in with a empty promise, preying on the unemployed.

It was Saturday night, John and Seymour argued louder and faster. Other bar goers were staring at us. I was getting bored of their conversation after three beers in, my news feed becomes more interesting. My boredom and alcoholism lead me to the job app NOW HIRING. I scrolled through jobs, quickly reading their requirements and salaries. I wasn’t looking for anything specific or taking it seriously, I was passing time. At one point the jobs became too weird or had little to no information. I sent my resume to a few entry level jobs, not expecting to hear back from any of them.

“You hear this guy?” Seymour said while grabbing my forearm, snapping me back to reality. “He said that Star Trek: The Next Generation is overhyped.” He turns to John. “You know it was the highest rated show of its time.”

“I’m not saying it wasn’t awful, but it was on the verge of being cancelled for a reason. Their writing was bad.” 

“It’s space camp.” Yelled Seymour.

“Bad first two seasons.” John reiterated.

“I’m gonna go out for a smoke.” I announced, the bar was packed but I managed to squeeze past the crowd.

Lighting my camel blues I sat on a stoop next door. The night was busy, drunk white people were walking the streets. I scrolled some more until I reached the ninth post on the thirteenth page.

It looks so fake, but I didn’t think much of it, I sent my resume. Just two taps on my phone and they have my contact information. 

The next day I was hung over, and very hungry, my roommates were cooking. I staggered to the bathroom with my towel and loofa. The warm shower woke me up. 

RING!

An unknown number. I let it go to voice mail.

RING!

I silence it.

RING

I angrily turned off the water and answered.

“Hello?”

“Hi is this Austina?"

“Yes. Who is calling?”

“I’m Brain!” He sounded positive and chirpy. “I’m with New York Bankers. We saw your application on For Hire and we’d love for you to come to the office for an interview. We’re having a interview event today and we can squeeze you in.” Brain said with much enthusiasm.

“Today is Sunday. You guys work Sunday?”

He chuckles lightly. “ Yeah. When the banks close, New Yorkers are open! We pride ourselves on filing, account managing, and book keeping for New Yorkers any day of the week. Holidays and weekends!”

“Well, today isn’t great for me. Can we reschedule for tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow?” He sounded hurt. “ Tomorrow we won’t be doing interviews, today is your only chance. We’re gonna be here till 3pm.”

I didn’t know how to get out of this conversation.

“Look Austina. You’re probably having second thoughts right now. It’s a Sunday you probably want to stay in bed all day right. I would too, but I wouldn’t be in the office right now, if I knew there wasn’t money to be made here. NY Bankers is a fast paced work environment we work closely with our clients and they’ve come to trust us. We offer paid training and large commissions. If you want to start making a lot of money this is your chance. 

“Sure. I can come in at 1:30pm.” I caved to Brian’s sale. He gives an address. It’s by Union Square park. He tells me how lucky I am to get this opportunity and what it means to be apart of New York Bankers. I hang up and return to my shower.

I finished my shower, quickly dried myself, put on my pjs, grabbed my laptop and typed New York Bankers.

I found a website of a stock photo slide of New York City. Each photo had blurbs about their company. They were all vague and meaningless attributes of their performances. Quotes of their accomplishments from random “clients.” Whenever I clicked on anything outside of the home page it lead me to a construction page. I’d seen enough. These guys are scammers, I closed my laptop and laid on my bed. I decided not to go. I looked at the job posting on my phone. I was thinking about reporting the post until the idea came to me.

I grabbed my suit jacket, put my phone in the front chest pocket, camera facing out. It was a perfect fit, the camera was above the flap. I hit record and did some test shots. The footage is good, but the sound wasn’t.

Found my good tape, cut out little squares and taped a LAV mic cable on my chest. I connected it to my phone via a small hole behind my chest pocket, hide it well. It looked really discreet, no one could tell I was recording them. Finally I moisturized, dried my hair, picked out the rest of my outfit and left confident in this interview.

There was a farmer’s market happening, I bought coffee and doughnuts and went across the street to NY Bankers. It was a corner glass building, 12 stories tall with a balcony patio. The building reflected the blue sky from every angle like it was apart of the sky. Beautiful, reflective and bright.

There was one banner inside, it hung behind the front desk. Despite the people walking around me, no one seemed to notice that this building exists. There was no one in the lobby, it was empty. I went through the revolving door.

An empty black marble room, cool A.C, one long red mat that lead to a hallway. The banner had an outline of the five boroughs with the word “Bankers” spelled across it.

Down the carpet was an elevator.

DING!

Inside there was only one glowing button. Five.

DING! Men and women in suits sat on black cushion seats against a white wall. A male receptionist looked at me. 

“You must be Austina! I’m Brain.” He had the same cheery personality she heard on the phone.

“Am I late?”

“No. You’re right on time.” He points to the large lobby room where men and women were sitting. “Take a seat with the rest.” It doesn’t matter where."

There was one seat open in the middle. I had a clear view into the office, I got a pan shot of the office as discreetly as I could.

Four rows of desks with men and women hunched over typing, reading, talking and calculating. Few were silently arguing in their phones, trying not to disturb the peace. Others had small talk by the water cooler, few were at the patio. They all looked middle aged and most of them were large and tall. Most of them were white, few were black and brown. 

It seemed like another world, I had so many questions. They all ignored us and looked into their computer screens. Some were happy, others had no expression at all.

“Hey. How long have you been waiting?” I whispered to the tall black women to my left. 

“Ten minutes.” 

“Isn’t this strange?”

“No, It’s an off market trading company. Large accounts making their next move.”

“That sounds illegal.”

“Look at that man, in the red shirt, in the back.” She nods her head to a man with a red shirt and grey pants. “He never puts the phone down. He’s making calls. To who? Families that rest on Sundays.”

“Shady. All of it’s shady.”

“Money is money if it’s dirty or clean.”

“Who are you?”

“You can call me Patrica.” 

“I’m Austina.”

“That’s such a white girl’s name.” 

“Hey, this is my city. I ain’t getting scammed by these idiots. Think about what they’ll make us do?”

“Learn to take the money. People with gold don’t let go.”

“You are something you know that?” 

She chuckles. “I’m the whole package.” 

We waited for fifteen minutes. The office seemed to be in a loop. One conversation begin, another ends, when that one ends, a new one begins. They were lively for a Sunday. 

“Hey Brain?” I walked up to the desk. He looks up from his desktop. “Who are these people? When you said you work Sunday, I wasn’t sure what to expect.”

He chuckles at the question. “So these guys are our senior staff. They’ve been with us longer and have clients that require special attention.” Brain said. “Think of us as an accounting firm, but you don’t have to worry about working weekends. New hires have regular hours. Today is the only time our hiring manager can conduct interviews.” 

“How long have y’all been open?”

“We opened at 2020. We began working remote but are slowly letting senior staff in.”

An older man with a large stomach and a tucked in blue shirt. “Hello Brain. Is this everyone?” 

“Yes. They are all accounted for.”

“Are you one of them?” The older man looks at me.

“Yes.” I say proudly. “I’m Austina.”

He holds his hand out, we have a firm handshake.

“Great! Join your colleagues, we’re moving on soon.” He said. I sit back down. He pulls up his pants and steps forward to the line of people. “Thank you for arriving, especially on a Sunday. I’m Alexander, the hiring manager. If you all follow me, I’ll lead you all to another waiting room.” 

We all chuckle. "Please have your resume ready.” He announced.

The hairs on my arms raised, my shoulders shivered. Keeping my smile and composure, I stayed cool. I was so focused on my outfit, I forgot to print my resume, I was racking my brain trying to figure how I can do this.

Alexander lead us to another waiting room. This time the seats were across from three conference rooms. We had a clear view of the conference room and interview. The walls and door were glass. Three men sat at the far left end of the conference table. They looked like Alexander. Big gut and tucked in dress shirts.

“Okay everyone grab a seat. The first interview will take about twenty minutes, afterwards we’ll ask a couple of people to stay for a second interview. Thank you for your patience.” He pulls the door open. “Okay let’s start from the left side.” He point at a young man with a blue shirt and black suit. He follows Alexander inside. 

Sweat runs down my temple. Other applicants have their printed resume on their laps. 

One by one we go into the conference room. Alexander does most of the talking while the applicant listens. They do ask for the resume. The other men only ask one question then Alexander talks a bit more. 

It was my turn. Alexander points to me, welcomes me in the conference room. My heart races, avoiding his blue eyes. He closes the door behind me. He joins the rest of fat old men. None of them introduced themselves, they all nod at me.

“You’re Austina?” the first large man asks.

He gestures to the seat, but I don’t sit. “Yup that’s me! I applied last night and got a call from Brain this morning! I’m very curious about this place. I’m excited to learn from y’all.”

“Do you have your resume?” Alexander asks.

My heart beats like crazy. My back stiffens, I clenched my fists, cleared my throat and answered truthfully. 

“You don’t need my resume.” They share a look of confusion. “A good saleswoman doesn’t need references or experience. All that we need is ourselves and a friendly attitude. My pervious jobs won’t tell you anything that will satisfy you.” Unbuttoning my suit jacket. “ Let me repeat that, nothing I say can satisfy you. What matters is the thick of my skin and my smart head. Every New Yorker has gotta be tough. So let me tell you about me. Stuff I’m proud of. I was born and raised in New York City. I went to college for two years and returned to the city to build my net worth. Currently I’m working in Macy’s selling perfume. A very high commission job with a lot of competition.”

“What were you studying?” The second large man asks.

“Communication and Media. Social Media skills.” 

“That’s a very popular field. Why did you leave college?” Alexander follows up. 

“The college didn’t have a great communication department. There weren’t enough courses for people in my major. It didn’t live up to my expectation.”

“Do you plan to go back?” The third large man asks. 

“No. I believe the greatest learning tool is first hand experience.” I stood up. “You see before I worked in Macy’s I interned at Buzz Feed. I learned a lot from them, how to manage social media and SEO. One thing I learned is the value of an image.”

I stepped closer to the large men.

“You see presentation matters, sure. But what’s really important is the substance. If we aren’t authentic to ourselves and others then how can anyone believe anything that we are selling? Consistency and Communication are the most important traits for entrepreneurs. In our modern age anyone can be anything with a instagram post. Who we are is a front, what counts is what we're selling.” 

“How are you in accounting and filing?” The second large man asked.

“I have the memory of an elephant. I had great experience working with analytics and data sets. One of my tasks at Buzz Feed was predicting our engagement.”

“How long did you work at Buzz Feed, why did you leave it for Macy’s?” The third large man asks.

“Simple. My goal is to own and operate my own social media app. Buzz Feed was a great experience for me to see how a media company operates. Macy’s is a way to support myself as I build my own app from my room.” 

“That’s very ambitious. Does anyone support you?” Alexander asks.

“Nope. I live alone, I’ve dumped all my savings into this project. I’ve been doing this for the past two years.”

“Wow. What attracted you to this job?” The first large man asks. 

“Simple, the management experience. I would love to learn how you all work with clients and meet their need. I know my company will have difficulties and hiccups, but a good leaders needs to work under strenuous circumstances. A good leader will make it work. I can’t wait to get started and prove to you that I’m an exceptional saleswomen and leader.”

“Austina. Thanks for your time. Return to your seat. Please stick around.” Alexander says as he opens the door for me. He points at Patrica, she goes inside.

My heart calms down. Breathing in and out, the blue sky from the patio calms me.

I take my seat and rest my head against the wall. I wipe the sweat from my brow and the watch the other applicants go in the conference room, one by one. After the last one, Alexander steps in front of us. “Thank you for waiting. We appreciate everyone for spending their Sunday with us. I’m gonna go through a list of names, these are people who we believe aren’t suited for the job. We’re looking for people who have certain skills that we believe can improve our company.” 

Alexander goes through a list of names. “Unfortunately I wish I could hire you all. Please leave your resume at the front desk.  We appreciate you coming here, but we’re going with the other candidates.” My name wasn’t called.

“Everyone who is staying please stay here. We’ll have lunch ready soon.”

Half of the applicants leave. Patrica stays. 

“What did y’all talk about?” She asks me.

“Nothing. I just told them about background.”

“Me too. Nothing about the job.”

The last of the people left.

Alexander and the other interviewers stood in front of us. The light go out, everyone puts away their phones.

“Well lunch is served.” 

Suddenly they began unbuttoning their shirts. All the office workers stood up, doing the same. 

“What are you doing?” I yelled.

Alexander ignored my objection, he kept unbuttoning. Their stomachs aren’t stomachs. A lip? A seam like a long scar, but it had a different skin tone. Alexander’s stomach was opening. It was happening everywhere. The office workers began changing. Everyone burst out of their clothes, naked and wide open. Their skin changed to a pale color. Their stomaches unfolded, their ribcages are teeth. 

A mouth opens, wider and taller than Alexander. I didn’t scream or run, the red flesh of the mouth-stomach opened up and licked its ribcage-teeth.

A wide slimy red tongue latches on me and pulls me inside its mouth. In a matter of seconds the mouth closes on me, it's pitch black. Its teeth pierced my ankles, it tries to bite my head but I dodged the canines. I scream, writhed, kicked and punched everything I could. Nothing freed me from the tongue.

I saw the sharp tooth from the corner of my eye. I swerved my head left, barely missing it. I could feel the teeth crunch down on my ankles. Everything kept getting tighter, it wanted to finished its meal.

With sheer force I pushed my left arm against the tongue to give myself some space. With my right arm, I reached for my suit pocket. I grabbed my phone and pull out the LAV mic wire. I balled it up in my left hand.

I tied the wire around the tongue, luckily it was long enough, and strangled the muscle with all my strength, I screamed “Let me out!"

Suddenly something echos, a scream from deeper inside. Gurgles of flesh and monstrosity. Real light peeked from behind me. I didn’t let go until I saw the office ceiling. The gurgles turned to a monstrous scream.

It spat me out on the floor, I scramble to my feet and I ran towards the exit. I ignored the pain as much as I could but my left ankle was like a dog’s chew toy. I hid behind an office desk and bandaged my foot with a cloth from my suit. I looked at the office and I didn’t know what I was looking at.

They were all large, tall, and wide, there was nothing human. It was like a Venus flytrap but with arms and a tongue. A large set of teeth and a pair avian arms like a bat. It’s jaw rested on the floor along with some lumps of fat.

Their mouth-stomaches were gnawing and chewing on the applicants. Few were pulling apart their limbs. Others chewed with their mouths open. Chucks of human flesh were minced by the sharp teeth of their mouth-stomaches. Patrica was gone, I looked for anyone alive. The red shirt was backed in a corner, they surrounded him, three monsters ripped him apart. His clothes and blood flew everywhere.

Saliva drooled down their lips. The munching and gnawing filled the room. It smelled foul. I kept moving towards the hallway, sticking to the desks. They ignored me, too busy with their food. I came to the elevator, I kept pushing the button.

I finally looked back at the monster that I came out of, it writhes in pain. Others attended to the injured one, they helped him stand up, they rubbed his mouth-stomaches. They turn around to the patio and climb up a ramp? 

They walked past the patio railing, on the blue sky. Each step they took revealed an invisible ramp. A bright light appears just above them. Another room. I caught a glimpse of a grey room with long reflective panels. Alien letterings and icons. In the center, the creatures laid on their side, their stomach mouths eating huge plates of meats. They only wore gold necklaces.

Before the injured monster enters the invisible room, it yells something, a word, a sentence? I don’t understand it but everyone stops. Their yellow eyes stare at me. They all finish chewing their food and get up. 

They run towards me! 

DING!

I step in and hold the close button. 

It closes just before one of them reached me.

I put my back against the wall.

DING!

I run across the lobby. I push through the rotating door and bolt out of there. I run across the street, but the park was empty. I ran into the subway and tried to find a cop. 

Finally I see a cop, a human, waiting by the subway gate. I grabbed his arm and yell “I need your help!” I leaned on him, start to heave and cry. Frantically explaining what happened to me and why I’m covered in red slime. He tries to calm me down, I know I sounded insane, but I had to show someone the monsters posing as bankers. He might’ve believed me, but he talks into his radio and calls for a medic. He brings me back outside where an ambulance arrive. I frantically tell them to check the building and go to the fifth floor. The cop assures me that he will, but I know he won’t. Medics surround me, they rest me on their stretcher and treat my ankles.

Detectives are the first to greet me, I tell them everything that happened. They can’t search the building unless they have a warrant. They ask me how I got in. “It was unlocked.” I answered. “I went inside and took the elevator to the fifth floor.

“That building hasn’t been leased in years. We called the owner, no one has been inside.” The detective said.

“But I applied to a job on Now Hiring. Their receptionist called me and asked me to go there for a job interview.”

“You did an interview with Human-eating alien monster?"

“I FORGOT MY RESUME! I SAT ACROSS A WORKING OFFICE FULL OF PEOPLE! THERE WERE OTHER APPLICANTS! PATRICA IS MISSING! NEW YORK BANKERS! WHEN BANKS ARE CLOSED, NEW YORKERS ARE OPEN! THEY CALLED ME! I SAW THEM TURN INTO MONSTORS! THEY TRIED TO EAT ME!”
