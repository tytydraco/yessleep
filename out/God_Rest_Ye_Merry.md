It had been a couple of days near the end of Christmastide when the government broadcast came that would change my life forever. Now, I was nothing more than a nipper when it happened, so forgive me, my most esteemed reader, as my recollection is hazy—true to most of this period of my life, and, if I am being honest, with the entirety of my life. Still, I will do my best to relate a cohesive narrative of the events that happened that night. I also understand that what I am about to type out and share with the broader world beyond the limits of my facility will seem… well, the ramblings of a mad man, but I assure you I am not that. This truly happened to my family and me. I am sure of that, and what I saw is very much real, even if my doctors do not believe so.

I distinctly remember being nestled deep against the warm fabric that lay over my mother’s bosom, my favourite stuffed animal, an anthropomorphic crocodile from some movie that’s long been erased from even the deepest recesses of my mind, against my own, as her supple fingers scurried through my hair. We were supposed to be wearing matching ugly Christmas sweaters for the party, but my mother had bought a size one too large. And so we just lay there, watching some horrendous festive B-movie. I felt relatively calm. My eyes were drowsy, and the sound of my own breath, mixed with the shimmering of the lights strewn across our tree and the oh-so-soothing crackles of the embers, was somniferous. Then my eyes crept open slightly as a frizzled-looking bureaucrat with loose skin replaced the movie. The officialdom of my city had declared that all forms of merriment, all vibrant colours, and any upbeat or jovial music were to cease immediately. They did not specify why, just that it needed to be done, lest we all want to die; lest we all want to live in agony; lest we all want to be disappointed; lest we all wish never to receive a gift again; lest we all want to live an outcast life.

I had asked my mother, with a characteristic, tired juvenile curiosity, what the man meant. She couldn’t explain it. She had gotten up, sat me down in the chair, put a festive blanket over me, and told me she needed to call my father. I believe I had sat there for quite a while, drifting off again, when I heard a pounding off a ways away. BAMBAM! I wanted to see, but like the dutiful son I was, I stayed put. BAMBAMBAM!

The knocking had gotten more intense. My heart had skipped a beat; even as young as I was, with my social reasoning just barely developed, I could still parse the evident ire in each of those knocks. I tried sinking myself deeper into the couch cushion, and one foot succeeded. I desperately craved the safe and intimate embrace of my mother, and I thought my wish had been granted when she came back into the living room. But to my horror, she had skipped past me and headed down the hallway to where our front door resided. I heard the rattle of the lock, then the creak of the door opening.

“Hello,” my mother had said. “What can I do for you this—” A feminine scream filled my ears. My mother was pushed onto her fundament. She was now curled against the wall. Seeing her as terrified as I was made me even more frightened. There was a rhythmic *thumpthumpthumpthumpthump*, and men, reminiscent of soldiery, marched into the living room. They began tearing down our tree and smashing ornaments with little care for the sanctity of our living space. I watched as they tore down everything we owned and threw what they couldn’t easily smash into the fires. One approached me slowly, yet somehow with unnerving steadfastness. His uniform was not of the CAF, nor was it American or any other military. To this day, I cannot tell you who these men belong to. But the man who approached me was large compared to me, muscle-bound with sallow skin. He tried to give a friendly smile, but those rotten teeth only made him more unsettling.

“Hey there, kid,” he had said. “I’m going to have to take the toy.”

“No!” I protested. “You can’t take Mr. Smiley.”

“That name is the reason I have to!” he said. “So hand it over.”

“No!” I protested again.

“Damnit, kid!” All semblance of nicety vanished in an instant as he rushed over towards me and tried pulling the toy out of my grasp. When he found it to be unusually firm for a kid my age, he had wacked me in the face with no hesitation, so that my grip became limp, and he could whisk my beloved toy away. My face began to smart, but I paid no heed to the pain as I watched in abstract horror as he hurried over to the fire, the dancing flames tauntingly trying to grab at Mr Smiley.

“No!” I had shouted. I had skittered off the chair and ran towards the man, but my body hit the hardwood as two other men—both of whom were incredibly stout, may I add—leaned their full weight onto my fragile frame. The pain was immense. Bruising was inevitable, and I felt my ribcage press tight against my organs. But none of the physical pain could prepare me for the mental agony of watching Mr Smiley descend into the hungry flames; they wrapped around him, his soft green skin turning tarlike, and soon enough, he had gone from something I could hold into billows of repugnant smoke. I had wept. I had wept harder than I ever had before. My mother started to shout at the men, and they argued and argued and argued. Good God, did they argue! For some reason, the men had no reservations about manhandling a nine-year-old, but they would not dare touch my mother. In fact, they seemed rather afraid of her. Perhaps it was her bombastic zeal. But whatever the reason, it caused them to slow their rampage.

“Please, ma’am!” one of them, a younger fellow, pleaded. “This is for your own good…”

“I do not care!” she said. “Get out of my house! He needs to come out with the rest of everyone!”

“That is not safe, ma’am. It is best—” There was a rumbling sound. “Shit, quick, turn off the lights and put out the flame!” They did so, and my mother swept me up. Then we crouched behind the chair as the men suddenly had rifles in their arms. The world went quiet. The men lined up neatly. They were so still that one could mistake them for toy action figures. Splatter sounds accompanied the rumbling. A bright, intense light lit the room from the hallway. It was a serpentine creature made of fetuses and five-week-old babies and little boys and little girls and teenagers and oh God who knows what else, gooey and slimy, with deep, visible pores across its skin that oozed what could only be described as literal shit. Yet, it was oddly festive in appearance. It had strings of Christmas lights around it with little bows now and again along the line, and atop its body was a nativity scene that had been corrupted to the point that it looked demoniacal. It had a mouth of rotting teeth, eyes made of dead Golden Retrievers, and it slithered with jagged movements; I swore I could hear the bemoans of the individuals who made up the monster—but they were not cries for help or screams of agony. No, they were Christmas carols that had been lowered in register to create a sombre, macabre melody. The men started to fire their guns, shells falling to the floor, but they did not damage the creature.

“Shit,” one of the men said, “there is still something related to Christmas in here!”

Then my mother was yanked from behind me and thrown into the middle of the room. I watched as she slumped, taking little, useless steps backwards. The creature had locked eyes with her Christmas sweater and seemed to beam with excitement. Then it rushed forward, and to my horror, a sight for which my hand shakes just trying to type this out, my mother fell into its cavernous maw. She screamed as green tentacles with little mouths of sharp teeth emerged and wrapped around her. Two of the tentacles flew close to her ear and whispered something gently, then she went limp and began mumbling the lyrics to God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen before descending slowly down its gullet. It grew. It grew and it grew and it grew and it got bigger and more shit poured out of the holes as it grew so big it threatened to tear the very house around us down. The Christmas carols became louder, to the point that to this day, I am astonished I am not hearing-impaired. But with my mother gone, there was nothing left in our home that was even remotely merry. The very notion of Yuletide had gone extinct in our household. So the men began to fire their rifles, and this time the creature shrank with each hit, shrieking as it did so, till it was no more than the size of me. The bullets suddenly stopped working, flinging off its body as it scurried out of the house.

I do not remember what happened between then and my arrival at the facility I have called my home for the last thirty years of my life, but one thing I do know is that what happened that night was real. It had to have been. But I have yet to find anyone who believes me, so here I am, writing this. Maybe there is someone out there who has seen the creature, and perhaps I wish to express this experience in a creative way, which I personally find quite enjoyable. Either way, I hope to reach someone out there who is willing to talk to me, listen, or even relay a similar experience. But I will say this: I am the reason my facility does not celebrate Christmas.
