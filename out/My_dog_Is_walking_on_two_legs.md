I live alone in a secluded house in the mountainous region near Petrópolis. It’s a quiet place, surrounded by dense forest, perfect for anyone looking to escape the chaos of Rio de Janeiro on weekends and holidays.

My only constant companion is Barnaby. Barnaby is, or was, a four-year-old Golden Retriever. Forty kilos of pure love, with fluffy golden fur. He is the kind of dog that gets scared of his own farts and brings you a slipper when you get home, wagging his tail so hard his whole body wiggles along with it.

It all started three days ago, on a Tuesday night. It was pouring rain. One of those summer storms that knocks out the power and turns the dirt roads into mud pits. I was on the porch, smoking a cigarette and watching the rain, with Barnaby lying at my feet.

Suddenly, he lifted his head. His ears went erect. The fur on his neck bristled. He was staring at the tree line, where the forest begins. It’s pitch black out there at night, but he saw something. Barnaby let out a low growl. Not the playful growl he makes when we play tug-of-war. This was a guttural, vibrating sound that seemed to come from deep within his chest. It was Fear.

“What is it, boy?” I asked, putting out my cigarette. Barnaby didn’t look at me. He was fixated on the darkness.

And then, he did something he had never done before. He ran.

He jumped the low porch railing and bolted toward the forest, barking furiously.

“Barnaby! No! Get back here!” I screamed. But the thunder drowned out my voice. He vanished into the trees.

I spent an hour calling him. I grabbed my flashlight and raincoat, stepping a bit into the woods. Nothing. The rain washed away any scent or tracks. I went back inside, soaked and worried. Domestic dogs don’t last long in the wild. There are snakes, cougars, and traps set by illegal poachers. I left the back door unlocked, put out a bowl of fresh food, and sat in the living room, waiting, listening to the rain on the roof.

I fell asleep on the couch. I woke up at 3:00 AM to a sound. Claws on the wooden floor. I jumped up.

The back door was open. “Barnaby?”

He was in the kitchen, standing over his water bowl. Drinking, but... in a strange way. He wasn't lapping up the water noisily like he always did. Instead, he had his snout submerged in the water, motionless, as if he were absorbing the liquid by osmosis.

I sighed with relief. “You idiot,” I walked over to him. “You scared me. Where did you go?”

He lifted his head. He was wet and covered in mud. There was a smell on his fur. Not the smell of wet dog. It smelled like overturned earth and something rotting—something sickly sweet.

“Gross, Barnaby. Did you roll in a carcass?”

He didn’t wag his tail. He just looked at me. Golden Retrievers have brown, warm, expressive eyes. But Barnaby’s eyes were... opaque in that moment. There was a milky film over them. And he didn’t blink.

He stared at me for ten whole seconds. Without moving a muscle. Without panting.

“Come on, boy. Bath tomorrow. Bed now.” I pointed to his bed in the corner of the room. He didn’t move.

“Bed!” I ordered, more firmly. Barnaby turned his body. Not in a fluid motion. It was a rigid movement. First the front paws, then the torso, then the back paws. Like a tank maneuvering.

He went to his bed and lay down. But he didn’t curl up. He lay on his stomach, with all four legs stretched out and his head held high, staring at the wall.

"He must be traumatized," I thought. "He saw some animal in the woods and got spooked." I locked the door and went to sleep.

The next day, things got worse. The smell didn’t come out with the bath. And I bathed him with flea shampoo, scrubbing until my arms ached. But that smell seemed to emanate from beneath his skin. And the skin itself... While I was soaping him up, I felt that it was loose.

Dogs have loose skin on their necks, I know. But this was different. It felt like his skin was a suit one size too big for his body. When I pulled at his fur, the skin came away too easily, sliding over the muscles as if it weren't connected.

And he was cold. Dogs have a higher body temperature than humans. They are warm to the touch. Barnaby was freezing. Like a slab of steak taken out of the fridge.

“You must be sick,” I murmured. “Hypothermia, maybe?”

I tried to give him a treat. He loved liver biscuits. I placed the biscuit in front of his nose. He sniffed it. Or pretended to sniff it. Then, he opened his mouth and let the biscuit fall inside. He didn’t chew. He just swallowed it whole, with a convulsive movement of his throat, like a snake swallowing an egg. I shivered all over.

I spent the day working in my home office. Barnaby stayed in the hallway. He didn’t sleep. Every time I looked, he was there. Sitting... strangely. Too upright. His spine perfectly straight, his front legs stiffly extended. He looked like an Egyptian statue, not a normal dog.

And... he was watching me. Whenever I turned my head quickly, he was staring. But as soon as our eyes met, he would look away at the floor. As if he were... dissembling.

That night, I called my ex-girlfriend, Clara, who is a vet.

“Clara, Barnaby is acting weird. He’s cold, his skin is loose, he’s not eating right. And he’s looking at me funny,” I said, worried.

“Did he vomit? Have diarrhea?” she asked.

“No. He just... doesn’t act like he used to. He seems like a robot.”

“It must be PTSD if he ran into the woods. Or he might have eaten a poisonous toad. Bring him here tomorrow morning,” she said.

“Okay. I’ll bring him.”

“Oh, and David...” she hesitated. “Lock him in the guest room tonight. In case he has rabies or some neurological condition, he might get aggressive.”

“Barnaby? Aggressive? He’s afraid of butterflies, Clara.”

“Just for safety.”

I hung up. I looked at the hallway. Barnaby wasn’t there anymore.

“Boy?”

I went to the living room. Nothing. Kitchen. Nothing. Then I heard a noise coming from the guest room. The sound of little paws on the floor. But the rhythm was wrong. It didn’t sound like four paws... it sounded like two, like human footsteps.

I walked to the guest room door, which was ajar. I pushed it open slowly.

The room was dark, lit only by the moonlight coming through the window. Barnaby was there.

He was standing. Not resting on his hind legs to look out the window. Not jumping.

He was standing.

His hind legs were straight, the knees locked backward. His torso was upright. His front paws hung by his sides, limp, swaying slightly. He was facing away from me, looking into the wardrobe mirror. Watching himself.

He tilted his head to the left. Then to the right. Then, he tried to lift one of his front paws. The toes of his paw moved. Not like dog paws, which are fused. The toes separated and stretched, making a grasping motion in the air. I heard a sound.

A raspy whisper, coming from his throat. “Aaaarrrr... tuuurrr.”

My bladder let go. I felt warm urine run down my leg. I didn’t scream. The terror was so absolute it stole my voice. I took a step back. The floorboard creaked.

Barnaby’s head turned. Not his body. Just his head. It rotated almost 180 degrees, like an owl, to look at me over his shoulder. The neck twisted the loose skin like a wet rag. He smiled.

Dogs seem to "smile" when they are panting, tongue out. This wasn’t that. The black lips pulled upward, revealing all his teeth, including the molars way in the back. The mouth opened too wide, tearing slightly at the corners. There was no tongue. Just a black hole in his throat.

I slammed the door shut. I ran to my room and locked the door. I pushed the dresser in front of it. I grabbed my phone. No signal. Yesterday’s storm must have knocked out the tower’s power again.

I sat on the bed, clutching a baseball bat, shaking violently.

I heard footsteps in the hallway. Heavy footsteps. Bipedal. They stopped in front of my bedroom door. I heard the sound of his breathing through the wood. A wet, bubbling sound. And then, the doorknob turned. Slowly. The metal knob creaked. It turned left, then right. He was trying to open it.

With his paws.

“Go away!” I screamed. “Get out of my house!”

The movement of the doorknob stopped. Silence. Then, a voice. It wasn’t my voice. It wasn’t a movie monster voice. It was a collage of sounds.

“Sit... Stay... Good boy... Walk?”

He was repeating the words I said to him. But the intonation was wrong. The syllables were cut and pasted, like a defective recorder.

“David... biscuit... David... open.”

I started to cry. “You’re not Barnaby. What did you do to him?”

Silence again. Then, I heard a sound that broke my heart. The sound of Barnaby whining. That high-pitched little cry he made when he wanted into the room.

“Huuuum... wooof... wooof...”

It sounded so real. For a second, I thought: Am I crazy? Is he hurt out there and I locked him out?

But then the whine changed. It dropped in pitch. It became deep. It turned into a laugh. A dry, human laugh coming from a dog’s throat.

He started throwing himself against the door. The door shook. The dresser slid a few inches. That animal weighed forty kilos, but the force with which he hit felt like a hundred. The wood of the door began to crack. I looked at the window. Second floor. If I jumped, I’d break my legs. But if I stayed... it could be worse.

Suddenly, the sound stopped. The footsteps moved away. Going down the stairs.

I went to the window and peeked, hiding behind the curtain. The front door of the house opened.

The Thing that used to be my dog walked out. It walked on two legs, but grotesquely. The rear knees, which on dogs bend backward, were forced to bend forward, popping with every step. The golden torso shone under the moonlight. He walked to the middle of the lawn. And stopped.

He looked up, at my window. Knowing I was watching. He raised his right front paw and... waved. A rigid, human wave.

Then, he ran into the forest. But he didn’t run like a dog. He ran like a naked, deformed man, flailing his arms, disappearing into the darkness.

I stayed awake until dawn. When the sun came up, I grabbed my car keys, the baseball bat, and went downstairs. The house smelled like rot. There were mud marks and a viscous slime on my bedroom doorknob, the stair railing, the fridge. The fridge was open. All the raw meat was gone. The Styrofoam trays were torn on the floor. He ate everything. Including the plastic.

I ran to the car. As I drove down the dirt road to get out of there, I saw something on the edge of the woods.

I stopped the car. It was a collar. Barnaby’s red collar. It was lying on the ground, near a bush. And next to the collar... the rest. I won’t describe it in detail. But what I found there wasn’t a whole dog. It was... the inside part.

As if someone had taken off a dog suit and left the inside behind. The skin was gone. The head was gone. Only the muscles, organs, and bones remained, surgically clean.

I vomited right there. I got in the car and drove to the city. I went straight to the police. I told an edited version of the story. I said someone broke into my house, killed my dog, and threatened me. I didn’t mention the dog walking on two legs. They would have institutionalized me. The police went out there. They filed a report. They found Barnaby’s remains in the woods.

“Probably a jaguar,” the sergeant said. “Or some psychopath. We’ll investigate.”

I never went back to that house. I’m living in an apartment in downtown Rio, on the 15th floor. I sold the house for half its value. I thought I was safe here.

But last night... last night I was in the elevator. Going up alone. The elevator stopped on the 4th floor. The door opened. There was no one there. The hallway was empty.

I was about to press the button to close the door when I heard it. Coming from the end of the dark corridor. That sound of two paws on the floor.

I looked closely. Deep in the shadows, there was a silhouette. It wasn’t a dog. It looked like a man. A tall, thin man, wearing a long trench coat. But the way he was standing... The head tilted at an impossible angle. Arms too long, reaching past his knees. He was facing away. The hallway light flickered. The figure turned around.

I didn’t see the face. He was wearing a hood or a hat. But I saw the feet. He wasn’t wearing shoes. The feet were hairy. And they had black claws that clicked against the ceramic tiles.

And as the elevator door started to close, I heard the voice. Not a bark. But my own voice, whispered, echoing through the empty hall:

“Good... boy.”

The door closed. I am locked in my apartment now. I pushed the fridge against the door. I hear them out there. It’s not just one. It seems he taught others. They are scratching at the door.

Not at the bottom, where a dog would scratch. They are scratching at the height of the peephole.

They want to come in. And I don’t think they just want to bite me. I think Barnaby learned to walk on two legs because dog skin was too limiting. He wants something with thumbs. He wants something that can open doors. He wants my skin.

If you have a dog... and he runs into the woods at night... Do not go after him. And if he comes back different... if he looks at you for too long... if he seems to understand what you say a little too well... Lock the door.

And pray. Pray he hasn’t learned how to turn the knob.
