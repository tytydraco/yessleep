I've never been the most stable person, mentally I mean. I've been passed around from therapist to therapist like a ball in a football game. Every time I have to answer the same long string of questions with the same string of long answers. Despite the fact that it's a different person in a different building it's like the same day on loop. It's exhausting.

Because of my shaky mental state it didn't take long for them to prescribe me medication, I stopped keeping track of what they gave me by therapist number 3, not like it matters thank much. I'd still have to come back the next week no matter how many pills they shoved down my throat. But it's whatever I guess, at least they make me "normal" for a while.

I recently complained to my newest therapist, number 9, about these restless nights I've been having. Every morning it felt like I'd run a marathon in my sleep. It took me a dozen cups of coffee to even make it to her office. So she gave me another pill. It would knock me out, a face to pillow and lights out. "Just take one of these before you go to sleep, that should help you out," she spoke to me in that fake, plastered smile, as she wrote down something in her notes. We talked more after that, her still giving me pointless advice before sending me on my way.

I don't remember the ride home, I get spacy often so nothing unusual for me. I practically skulked into my apartment, knocking the door open with my shoulder and crashing onto my couch. Grunting in pain as a jagged sprint jammed into my back for a moment, thankfully it didn't draw any blood. But I didn't care much if it did, I was so tired I could have lost my arm and I wouldn't even notice.

I looked over the bottle of pills, contemplating if I should take them. But decided "fuck it", Taking a pill and swallowing. Immediately, I felt the drug take effect. My eyelids felt as heavy as tungsten as I couldn't help but lay on my back and let myself drift into slumber.

I woke up several days later.

I wasn't on my couch, I was in a bed, not my bed, and not my house. I was in a motel. The smell of a rancid damp carpet filled my noses as I got up and explored my surroundings. Time felt off, like I'd been on a plane that flew halfway across the globe.

I tried walking around, but my legs wouldn't move. It's as if they just wouldn't listen to my brain. I was still standing - just immobile. But they suddenly caught up and I began to move.

I went to the front desk, made some small talk with the mad man at the front desk to calm my nerves, he had a bit of an accent, you don't usually see someone with a British accent around here.

"So, what brings you to the states?" I asked. But was met with a confused look, he shot me back an awkward smile as if I just told a bad joke.

"What do you mean?"

"Well, I don't see many British people around here so I was just wondering."

"Sir, you do realise you're in England right?"

I wasn't talking to him anymore, I was on a plane.

I frantically look around, shooting off of my chair before grabbing a flight attendant. As I grasped her shoulders and opened my mouth to beg for answers, I wasn't there.

I looked around, the familiar sight of the peeling paint in my apartment walls, and a loose spring drilled into my back. I thought I was dreaming, but it still felt real, I just sat up in my crusty chair before checking my phone.

5 Days had passed.

I blinked, it was night time and I was in my bed again. I didn't know what to do, I panicked and closed my eyes, trying to hide from whatever horrid reality I found myself in. I opened my eyes, 10 more days had passed.

I ran to my door while calling my therapist, she didn't answer. I opened my door, 3 weeks had passed.

I'm still in my house, I keep waking up on my crotch, I'm trapped.

I've been writing this over the last couple of months. Every paragraph I finish I look up and weeksÂ  and weeks drift by. I can feel myself aging, my hair grow longer, my fingernails have begun curling with their length. My teeth are rotting in my mouth, I feel like I haven't brushed them in my mouth. The paint keeps peeling and peeling and my apartment is getting cold.

I started writing this 5 years ago. animals have nested in my home. My body is aging far faster than my mind. My eyes are blurry and my hearing is muffled. My fingers are weak and my nails droop down to my feet. All my teeth have fallen out.

And I'm so, so cold.
