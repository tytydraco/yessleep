 

When I first saw Martin Jefferies, I didn’t know that was his name.  He was just a man, walking towards me across the parking lot as I was heading from my car to the first of a couple of stores, his eyes bugged out and wild, his feet shuffledragging with every step as though walking through thick sand instead of on cracked asphalt, and his arms out in front of him, hands always grasping, grasping, grasping, like the scuttlecrawl of twin hermit crabs trying to outrun fate.

 

Every bit of him said “crazy”, which was the slightly more charming roommate of “dangerous” in my mind, and my instinct would have normally been to avoid his gaze, cut over a row, and hustle into the store before he could reach me.  But something in his terrible eyes held me—crazy or not, he was clearly terrified, and his terror had a desperate, pleading quality to it that made me want to try and help if I could.

 

“Sir?  Are you okay?  Are you sick or need a doctor or something?”

 

I had a momentary flash of presaged embarrassment—him giving me an offended look or shouting in a sane voice that he was perfectly fine, thank you very much.  But no, not this man.  His eyes were locked onto me now, and he was moving faster toward me, though only a little.  I saw the cords standing out in his neck and his arms tensed with effort as he seemed to pull himself through the air toward me.

 

Hesitating, I fought the urge to retreat and instead held my ground while putting out my own arms instinctively, maybe so he wouldn’t get too close.  “Sir?  Can you speak?”  If he didn’t say something soon I was going to just call 911 and let them deal with it.

 

His mouth opened for the first time then, a gasping but silent motion as he got close enough for me to see the light dimming in his eyes.  When he fell, he pitched forward hard, and it was purely instinct that led me to lunge forward and grab him, slowing his descent to the ground if not entirely stopping it.  His whole body was damp with sweat, and I absently wiped my hands on my jeans as I crouched down over him.  Yeah, he was dying or something, and I needed to get help fast.  Reaching into my back pocket, I was about to grab out my phone when my other arm was suddenly in his grip.  I tried to tug my wrist free, but he was surprisingly strong, using the last of his energy to push out three words as he held my gaze with the guttering light left in his eyes.

 

*“Everything is underwater.”*

 

The last word was barely out of him before he was falling back, face already slackening as water pushed up and out of his mouth and nose.  Distantly I heard myself start to scream.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

I stayed around until the EMTs and cops had the best answers I could provide, which amounted to little beyond what I’d seen.  I asked one of the guys from the ambulance what had happened to him, but he just shrugged. 

 

“Hard to say without more diagnostics.  Maybe a heart attack or stroke.”  He patted my arm.  “Nothing you could have done to save him.”

 

I frowned at him but held my tongue.  I wasn’t looking for reassurance.  I just wanted a better understanding of how strange the man had been, and why he had died so suddenly.  “But the water?  You know, the water I described coming from his mouth at the end?  What was that?”

 

He shrugged again.  “Probably vomit.  I know it looked clear, but that doesn’t mean it was water.  Bodies do some strange things when they’re shutting down.”  He gave a small chuckle.  “I guess with what he said, you thought he was drowning?”

 

I’d been staring at the spot where the man had been before they put him in the back of the ambulance, but I looked up and met the EMT’s eyes now.  “That’s what it looked like.”

 

He smirked.  “Have you ever seen anyone drown?  I mean in real life.”

 

I shook my head.  “No, I guess not.”

 

“Well there you go.  Things happen a lot different in real life than the movies.”  He glanced at his phone.  “Anyway, we have to go sign in this body and start the paperwork.  Thanks again for your help.  Have a good day.”

 

Nodding, I headed back to my car.  After sitting there for a few minutes, I debated heading on into the store, but instead I went back home.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

Five days later, my doorbell rang.  When I opened it, there was a well-dressed woman on the other side holding a large, sealed envelope.  The lettering on the outside was upside down, but I could still make out a thick, flowing script that said “To Whom It May Concern”.  Lifting my eyes from the words, I saw the woman was smiling at me.

 

"Hello there.  Your name is Matlin Park, correct?”

 

I nodded.  “Yes.”

 

“Good, good.”  She thrust out the envelope.  “This is for you.”

 

Not reaching to take it, I raised an eyebrow at her.  “What is this?  Why are you here?”

 

Her smile widened.  “Yes, sorry.  First time I’ve ever done something quite like this, so I’m sorry I’m so bad at it.  I’m an associate attorney of a large law firm with local offices in the area.  My boss tasked me with delivering this to you, per our client’s instructions.  Our client was Martin Jefferies, the man who I believe you saw die last week.”

 

I felt my heartbeat quicken.  “So what’s…are you trying to sue me or something?  I didn’t do anything.”

 

Giving an awkward laugh, she shook her head.  “No, no, nothing like that.  We handled Mr. Jefferies’ estate.  He had a significant bit of money, most of which he left with his family, but he had a very…well, unique provision in his will that is what brings me here today.  Essentially, the last person to see him alive, so long as they are not on a list of family members and friends he provided at the time his will was drafted, was to receive this envelope.  Inside are two things.  The first is a notebook with writing from Mr. Jefferies himself.  The second is a cashier’s check for $30,000.00.”

 

I blinked.  “What?  Why?”

 

She shrugged.  “I have no idea.  I never even met him.  All I can tell you is that per the will you are entitled to both so long as you, one, take both, and two, never contact anyone connected to Mr. Jefferies regarding what you may find inside that notebook.”  She raised her hand.  “I have been assured there is nothing illegal in the notebook, but ultimately, once you sign the release, it’s up to you whether you read it or throw it away.  So long as you do not attempt to contact our client’s friends or family, you will be $30,000.00 richer and never hear from us again.”  The woman pulled a form out from under the envelope and held it out.

 

Taking it, I studied it a moment before looking back to her.  “Do you have a pen?”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

I should have just cashed the check and thrown the notebook away without opening it.  It was one of those old-fashioned writing notebooks schools used to use for essays or long-form tests, though it looked reasonably crisp and new.  Thumbing through it, I felt a mixture of curiosity and dread.  This was all so strange.  Why do all of this?  It had to be something bad, right?  Like paying someone to take toxic waste to the landfill.  If that was true, I should just do them a favor, toss it in the trash or burn it, and enjoy the money.

 

The man’s face floated up to me, eyes searching and despairing as he used his last breath to speak to me.

 

Everything is underwater.

 

What the fuck did that *mean*?

 

Letting out a nervous sigh, I picked up the notebook and began to read.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

To Whom It May Concern.  It’s strange writing this, writing any greeting, since nobody may ever read it.  And if they do, if things turn out the way I think they might, it will hopefully be someone I’ve never known or even met before my last minutes in this world.

 

At the start I should say that I don’t write this to hurt anyone.  I’m not trying to put some curse on anyone or get out of anything.  I used to love the Ring.  The movie, you know?  And I thought the ending was neat because the people had to give up part of themselves to get out of the trap.  Had to hurt other people.  And I get that.  Hell, if I had a way out of this, I’d sure as hell take it.  Maybe even if it did hurt somebody.

 

But this isn’t a trap.  It’s just the truth.  And something in me won’t let me keep it to myself.  Maybe because I’ve always hated lies.  My pa used to go out and drink and whore and then he’d come home and lie to Mama about it.  I’d listen to her cry for hours after he’d passed out asleep.  I think it was the lying that hurt her the most.

 

Or maybe this is all a curse.  Or a virus that wants to spread.  I’ve heard viruses can make you do stuff, make you act ways where you’re more likely to make others sick too.  So maybe it’s like that.  I don’t know.

 

What I do know is that I don’t have much time left.  I’m writing this fast as I can while still trying to write neat, because I don’t know when it’s going to come over me again.  I can sort of feel it coming usually, but I can’t trust that.  I can’t trust anything. 

 

So let me stop whining to a stranger and get on with it.  Story time.

 

I have a good bit of money.  Worked like hell for thirty-five years, and now I’m semi-retired.  Started taking different trips, trying different things I never had time for before.  Some of that was what my daughter calls “thrill-seeking”, but it was really just me trying to figure out what I liked now that I had the time to think about such things.  Silly as it would have sounded to me even ten years ago, I wound up trying a couple of new age kinds of things.  Sweat lodges.  Chanting.  Some guided trances with psychedelics.

 

I only did drugs a couple of times.  It really didn’t work for me that well.  I’d get sleepy or nauseous, but not much else.  Then a guy I’d known for awhile hooked me up with some other people offering some kind of special experience.  A combination of smoke lodge and a drop of something they called “the Stuff”.  I asked my friend about it and he said it was a watered down and tweaked version of something called DOTS or Dissolution of the Self.  The original was too much, too dangerous, but “the Stuff”?  It was supposed to be really great.  Safe and powerful at the same time.

 

If my wife was still alive or my kids were younger, I’d have said no.  Hell no.  But I’d spent the last few months getting closer and closer to some unknown edge and I wanted to go further.  Poke my head over and look down into it.

 

So I did.

 

The dosing and the lodge, they don’t really matter.  I won’t waste time with that.  What I saw there, by itself, I’d just say I was on drugs and seeing things.  But when I had completely come down, knew I had completely come down, I was still terrified.  What I’d seen was the truth.  It made no sense.  It was impossible.  But it was still true.

 

Everything is underwater.

 

I’m not a dumb guy, but I’m no writer either.  I won’t do a good job explaining this maybe, but I still have to try.  When I took the dose, at first I thought I’d gone somewhere.  I was floating in some deep ocean, things swimming around me, sparkling light far above and pitch black beneath me.  All kinds of things were there.  Fish and eels and other stuff I hadn’t ever seen.  Plants that I don’t know.  And I could feel the weight of something more—not the water or the pressure, though I could feel that too. 

 

It was something watching me.  Watching and coming toward me, just too far away for me to see. 

 

All of that was scary and strange, but it wasn’t the worst part.  The worst part was I started realizing I hadn’t gone anywhere.  That I was still in that lodge, except I wasn’t.  Because the water wasn’t the hallucination.  The lodge was.  What I was seeing now was the real world we’re in, and this world we’ve been seeing is a lie.

 

I know how that sounds.  Like a crazy old druggie.  But I’m not.  And I don’t know how any of it works, or how it makes sense, but me not getting it doesn’t make it any less true.  That ocean is where we really are.  This world is a lie.  And remembering that other world is slowly killing me.

 

Because I keep getting pulled back.  You could call it flashbacks, but it’s not that.  It happens slow at first.  Sometimes it’s just a feeling or a smell.  Sometimes I’m suddenly back underwater for a few moments, or I’m on the surface, looking up at some sky that isn’t our sky.  Has never been our sky.  And yet always has at the same time.

 

When I’m there, I’m more myself that I am here.  I’m not human—I don’t know what I am.  But I’m at peace with myself and terrified of everything else.  Some because there are so many things there that want to find me.  To eat me, I think.  Some because I keep drowning.

 

It never happens all at once.  I’ll be underwater there, breathing fine, and then I’m choking and thrashing.  I think the lie of this world is too strong.  It’s poisoning us.  Making us unable to live in that other world.  Maybe that’s better, because that other world is so dark and strange.  Whatever waits after we die might be better than that cold dark.  Or maybe we can never really die there at all.

 

Either way, I am near the end I think.  In a few days or weeks I’ll just disappear from this fake place forever or I’ll die here.  I’ve already almost choked to death twice.  The second time I swear I threw up a gallon of water.

 

I’m staying away from my family and friends.  I don’t want them to see this and I don’t want them to know about it.  I should keep it to myself, maybe.  Maybe the idea itself is enough to… But I can’t quite do it.  Something in me won’t let me not tell it.  Spread it.

 

So that’s the end.  I know you won’t believe me.  And it’s better if you don’t.  I’m just tired.  Scared and alone too, but mostly tired. 

 

But now I’m done.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

The night that I read the notebook, I slept deeply.  And when I slept, I dreamed.

 

I remember water and darkness, much as Martin had described, but different too.  I woke up gasping and covered in sweat, and it wasn’t until I turned on the bedside lamp that I felt reassured that I was in this world and that it had just been a nightmare.

 

I felt uneasy all day that day, like a place inside me had been bruised and was still tender.  Jumpy and irritable, I went home from work early and watched t.v. late into the night, avoiding sleep until I couldn’t keep my eyes open.  The next morning I didn’t remember any new nightmares, and after a couple of days I wasn’t worried or skittish anymore.

 

It was that following Tuesday, as I walked home from the grocery store a few blocks away, that I first noticed that something was wrong.  Something smelled wrong.  I’d lived on that street for five years, and this was the first time I’d ever smelled?  Salt?  But not just salt.  That thicker, rolling smell that you only got at the ocean.

 

Heart beating harder, I looked around.  Everything was norm…

 

Across the street, in the alleyway across the street, something was moving.  It was low to the ground, but it didn’t look like a cat or crouched person or anything I might expect to see in those shadows.  What was it?

 

It shifted back and forth in the dark, and I squinted to make out more detail.  There was no way I was getting closer, but I did feel like I needed to see what it was.  If I saw it, I’d know it wasn’t anything out of the ordinary, and I could go on telling myself everything was okay.  As if my thought called to it, it glided out of the shadows and onto the sidewalk.

 

It was a shark’s fin.  Just the fin and the slight bulge of something massive underneath, cutting through the sidewalk as though breaking the surface of still waters.  There was no damage in its wake and no one else seemed to see it, but the more I stared at it in horror, the realer it seemed and the more everything else seemed to fade.  It twisted up and down the sidewalk for a moment and then turned sharply, swimming fast across the street, pointed directly at me.

 

“oh fuck.”

 

I threw down the bags and ran, and glancing back I saw it still behind me, a dark grey fin half my height tailing me, growing bigger as it started closing the distance.  Looking back ahead, I focused on running faster.  I had to get to my apartment.  It was on the third floor, and maybe that was enough to keep it away.

 

Rounding the corner on my block, I dug out my keys.  Less than half a block now.  I just…

 

I pitched to the ground as something swelled under my feet.  Lungs and heart screaming, I rolled onto my back in time to see a long tail flip out of the ground and twist away beneath the surface.  The impossibility of all this didn’t even occur to me at the time.  There was no debating that it was real, that it was true.  Just survival.  Just escape.

 

The fin reappeared, forty feet away and turning back toward me.  Scrabbling to my feet, I ran as hard as I ever have, the steps leading into my walk-up feeling like some distant dock as I forced myself to not look back again.  There was no time for that.  Only getting away or getting eaten.

 

Leaping onto the steps, I pushed past one of my downstairs neighbors who was coming out and ran up the stairs to my apartment.  I didn’t stop until I was behind my locked door and gasping on the floor, looking in every direction for a sign that the thing had followed me.  When I didn’t see anything, I crawled to the window and looked out at the street.  There was no sign of anything out there either, at least for now.

 

That’s when I started vomiting water.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

I think a week has passed since then.  I haven’t left my apartment since the shark, but it doesn’t matter.  Twice I’ve been pulled to that other place.  Martin was right.  He didn’t do a good job of describing it.  It’s so much worse.

 

This morning I woke up choking, not from water in my lungs but a bright orange tentacle around my neck.  When I tried to pull myself free, I realized both my arms were tightly held too by other limbs of whatever massive thing lay against my back.  I felt myself slipping into shock, like a small animal sliding down the throat of a snake, but It wasn’t crushing or biting me, at least not yet. 

 

Instead, it took the tip of one tentacle and delicately placed one of the suckers that lined its pink underbelly on the tip of my index finger.  I let out a whimper at the painful pressure there, and when the tentacle withdrew, I could see the smear of blood on my fingertip.  The limb holding that arm pulled my hand to the wall, swiping my bleeding finger against the white sheetrock with precise, decisive strokes.  When it was done, it pulled my arm back to my side before releasing me, its weight and bulk behind me fading even as I started spitting up water again.  When I was finally empty, I just laid on the soaked bed, shuddering and crying as I tried to come back to myself.  It was a few minutes before I had enough sense to look at the wall.

 

There was one word there.  It could have meant anything, but I knew what it meant.  It was a command, and maybe, if I’m lucky, a promise.  A way to escape this…this truth?  Maybe Martin waited too long and could have saved himself if he’d told everything while he was alive.  I don’t know.  I just know I have to try.

 

Just one word there.  Not much to pin my hopes on.  Or sell my soul for.  But I have to try. 

 

Just one word.
