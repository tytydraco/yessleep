When we were young, my cousin's and I had a bush house at the end of the back garden just before the garden opened up on the Heath. 

Due to me being a full time wheelchair user from birth it was Gran's idea that instead of having a tree house that had to be climbed, it would be safer and more  practical to have a "bush house"  that all us kids could use. 

Even though we protested greatly as (although I am disabled, I frequently used to climb trees in the local parks and  over the Heath (with the help of my cousins obviously;) but Gran's word was final, and we never argued with her as she was a beautiful and lovely matriarch, but also as tough as old boots and very scary when pushed!   

So with that we busied ourselves on choosing an appropriate bush, for our new play area. On selecting a perfect one Gran delegated tasks to the older boys to clear the outer area of the bush and also make a little hollow inside it with pieces of spare wood on the ground to serve as a basic floor so that my little  wheelchair could run safely and easily inside it.

Gran was reasonably young at the time, and while the boys were doing the heavy work she arranged  us younger ones  in getting furniture, supplies and accessories to  make our  new play space cosy and comfortable  for us all.

A year later,  our bush house was in full use, in the day time us younger ones  played in it after School, on weekends and holidays and in the  evenings and nights it was a place where the older cousins could have some privacy away; from the eyes of Gran and Mum to do whatever they did.

Our bush house was cosy though, we got chairs, bean bags and floor cushions donated by relatives and  friends of the family,  we also had  a small table that we made a tablecloth for and our Auntie J made some pretty curtains that we hung up the best we could, we even had a cupboard where we kept snacks in and  (only when the older boys, or Mum were there) we were allowed to use the camping stove to heat tinned beans and sausages or  pot noodles up and make tea. 
Gran's bingo friend Jean, donated  a hand-me-down rug; It was shabby and out of date, but we thought it was beautiful. 

It was slap bang in the middle of the summer holidays, probably in early July  when this happened; L and I were seven and G was eleven, our older Cousin  G's brother A was there earlier but by three o'clock had grown tired of hanging around with us and had gone out with his mates, the three of them were coming back later to make us all dinner on the stove. 

L and I were sitting at the table playing beggar your neighbour with a pack of playing cards that we got from the living room cupboard and G was sitting in the corner of the bush house on a beanbag reading The Secret Garden (for the third time!) It was just another normal at home day; nothing unusual or odd occurred till around four when we all heard a sound that was at odds with the peaceful scene.

It was between a growl,  an owl's hoot and a man mumbling, we weren't particularly outdoorsy kids  (being born and raised in the outskirts of urban London), but being bright little girls  we all knew that owls are nocturnal creatures and the accompanying sounds that were mixed with the hoots didn't come from the same bird.

The  weird sounds were joined by a furtive and stealthy rustling coming from the back of the bush house (actually, it was really near to where G was sitting and she jumped up stifling a scream by covering her mouth with her hands. 

We also saw a dark  dog-like size/shape  through the dense foliage of the back of the bush house which incidentally led straight onto the beginning of the Heath as I said earlier. 

The strangest thing  about this figure was; that it was very present, but rather ethereal, almost as if the "figure" was attempting to hide intentionally.

Also, throughout this period there were no other natural sounds,  no birdsong, no insect sounds, and no background human noise. (Being right in the centre of a council estate you could always hear people talking, cars revving  and dogs barking,  all the regular noises  of urban community living) but, at that time,  was as If the entire world had paused and us three were the only ones conscious and present, along with the mysterious figure. 

We didn't  know what to do, but we gathered together and both G and L took one handle of my wheelchair, and pulled me back out of our bush house, not taking our eyes off the translucent figure as we went. 

When  we were free from the bush house and  close enough to home for us to feel out of danger and safe, we just looked at each other very doubtfully, we were crapping ourselves. 

G said  suddenly.
"Stay here, don't move or speak!"
She ran to the garden shed and climbed up the side to the manky rotting roof, I completely lost it, letting out a squeal of utter fear, quick witted as usual L put her hand over my mouth and hushed me.

L and I watched while G looked over the hedgerow which divided our back garden from the beginning of the Heath;  
From our position her face was clearly visible; G's; expression was  a mixture of confusion, surprise and fright and her pretty brown eyes looked troubled.

We waited for G to come back to us before asking her in earnest what she saw.

She didn't answer straight away, but when she did she said. 
"It was so strange;  I didn't see anything, no dogs!… No other animals?!"
She paused, her young mind trying to summon the words to explain what she witnessed. 
"There was a man, I saw the back of him walking away towards the iron fence!"

My seven year old's mind found it hard to comprehend what G was saying  and one look at L told me  she was experiencing the same. 
We both said together. 
"What man G?! What did he look like?"

G sighed, biting her lip (a habit that she still has today, when she is anxious, worried or trying to explain something tricky or difficult!) Lol

"I didn't see him properly!... His face and all that,  I only saw his back. He did have really long scruffy hair though!"

Her eyes wandered over nervously to the end of the garden leading out  to the very public Heath.
L and I  both followed G‘s gaze, we all shuddered; nobody spoke for ages.

For a long time we sat in silence (G and L, sitting on the: back step) and me in my wheelchair alongside them.

Suddenly, I noticed something and exclaimed to the others. 
"Everything is back to normal; listen!"

We all listened; the regular everyday noises had returned, the world appeared to have resumed business as usual.

A while later A, and  his two mates came back and sensing some tension from us, they asked us what was up.

We did tell them everything, and two of them ran out to the back to have a look around;  they were gone for about forty -five minutes.

When they returned, they said they didn't see anything, no strange man; no animals, nothing unusual or dodgy at all, we spent the rest of the day hanging out with the boys, eating dinner in the bush house and later watching films and eating junk food. 

We didn't tell Mum about the experience until a few years back, long after we  were grown, and we still don't know, or can't explain what happened that day.
