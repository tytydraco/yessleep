During my childhood, I encountered something truly bizarre that has remained etched in my memory. This incident happened when I was about 12 years old, during a sweltering summer vacation in my hometown, Almora.

In our neighborhood, there lived a woman who seemed to teeter on the edge of sanity. She resided alone, her frail form often glimpsed through the tattered curtains of her small cottage. The people around took care of her, bringing her food and tending to her needs. Her name was lost to time; we simply referred to her as “the Enigmatic Woman.”

One fateful day, news spread like wildfire: the Enigmatic Woman had passed away unexpectedly. The villagers gathered somberly, preparing for her cremation. As the pallbearers lifted her lifeless body onto the wooden bier, an inexplicable event unfolded—the group stumbled, and the casket crashed to the ground. Gasps and murmurs swept through the crowd.

But then, the impossible happened. The same woman who moments ago appeared lifeless began muttering. Some speculated that she might still be alive, her spirit clinging stubbornly to her earthly form. They removed the cloth covering her face and untied her, intending to rush her to the hospital. To everyone’s astonishment, she stood up, her movements eerily graceful, and walked on her toes. Our house was adjacent to an ancient temple, and she headed straight towards it, her eyes fixed on some unseen horizon.

As she walked, she began digging up dirt from outside our house, her bony fingers clawing at the earth. She gathered the soil in her palms, clutching it as if it held the secrets of the universe. Once inside the temple, she flung the soil around, creating a chaotic swirl of dust and memories. That’s when my grandmother sensed the disturbance and screamed on top of her voice at her, invoking the gods to protect us.

But the most chilling part? The Enigmatic Woman mimicked my grandmother’s voice. In the exact same tone and inflection, she repeated what my grandmother had just said, her laughter echoing eerily off the temple walls.

I watched, frozen, as she wove my grandmother’s life story—the tragedies, the lost love, the long-buried regrets. It was as if she had absorbed my grandmother’s essence—the joys, the sorrows, the whispered secrets shared over countless cups of chai.Her laughter grew louder, more unhinged, until it seemed to pierce the very fabric of reality. And in that moment, I lost control. My bladder betrayed me, and I wet my pants, the warmth seeping into the ancient stone floor.

The villagers seized her, desperate to contain the chaos. They dragged her to the doctor, who could offer no rational explanation for her bizarre behavior. Later, I learned that she had passed away en route to the hospital, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and lingering fear.

To this day, the memory of that unnerving encounter haunts me. Was she possessed? A conduit for forgotten spirits? Or perhaps she glimpsed a dimension beyond our comprehension—a place where laughter and sorrow merged into something otherworldly. Whatever the truth, the Enigmatic Woman of Almora remains etched in my mind, a testament to the inexplicable mysteries that sometimes intersect with our mundane lives.
