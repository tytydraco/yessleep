Human-kind has forever longed to speak with the dead. Family, friends, lovers, the famous, the infamous, and the notorious. The question of all questions instilled in us as life wears us down and pulls out our hearts one piece at a time: What happens after we die? Well, it finally happened. Centuries of pain and heartache led us to this. It wasn’t anything in particular we did as humans or societies. The dead simply decided it was time to communicate with the living, and the powers that be allowed it to happen. We still don’t know why or fully understand how it’s happening. The religious believe it’s their faith, the atheist believes it confirms that there is nothing like a heaven after death, and some still don’t believe it’s happening, having not seen or heard it for themselves.

The question of ‘what happens after we die’ is still a question without an answer. As always, everyone believes what they want to believe. Of course, other questions about the dead calling remain unanswered as well. Why do the dead only call on landlines, for example? 

I have a theory that it’s how they knew to communicate before they died, and they’re just doing what they know. However, it doesn’t explain why the dead that never saw a landline can call home. Do they talk to each other on the “other side”? Before the dead started calling, there weren’t many landlines left in the world. We are cellular based people. Now billions of people have rewound the past and installed landline phones just for one day out of the year. Maybe the corded phone hanging on the wall fills them with hope. If that’s true, I guess it makes sense. 

The dead call only on Halloween, why not Christmas, or any other day of the year? This means Halloween has changed drastically in the past few years. Nobody takes their kids trick-or-treating anymore. Everyone stays home and waits on the phone to ring in hopes of speaking with someone they’ve lost.

Last Halloween was my first experience with the dead calling. My friend Chris lives across the road and he had invited me over to witness him talk to his mom. I didn’t know what to expect, but I’ve known Chris and his parents since grade school and knew he wouldn’t be trying any shenanigans. We hung out on the couch and watched whatever horror movies we could find, flipping back and forth between movies and giving our best amateur critiques. It was a much needed fun night with an old friend. I’d forgotten the whole reason for the visit until midnight, when the landline phone rang. We both jumped, me startled, him excited. 

Chris nearly tripped over his own feet getting to the wall where the phone hung. He answered, staring at me while he nodded his head up and down. After fifteen minutes of head nodding and repeating the word ‘yes’ over the phone, I got up the nerve to interrupt. I asked Chris who he was talking to. He stopped nodding abruptly. 

I quietly walked toward Chris and heard a faint voice on the other end of the line. I approached arm’s length of him and stopped. Instantly, his mood changed. He slammed the phone back on the wall, scaring me. Chris pushed angry tears away from under his eyes. I ran out the front door and back across the street to my house, not really knowing or understanding what I’d seen. That night was a sleepless night, wondering if the voice on the phone had been Chris’s mom, and what she might have said to upset him. The next day I saw Chris in his front yard and he waved just like he did every other day, as if nothing had happened the night before. I decided at that moment that I would have my own landline next Halloween. 

Over the next year, time slowed for me. I wondered daily about what happened at Chris’s house. We’d had plenty of run-ins since last Halloween, but never talked about that night. Every time I’d bring it up, he’d change the subject to something else. The dead calling Chris and the events of that night consumed me. If I got a call on Halloween this year, I was going to be ready.

My olive-green landline phone had been hanging in the kitchen since last November, waiting patiently to ring out to me. I’d accidently knocked it off of the wall a few times in the past year. Each time sent me into a hurrying scramble to hang it back up, fearful I might miss a call from the other side, even though I knew it was impossible. When it hit October, though, I barely left the house, the thought of a call from the dead never leaving my mind. Even when I walked out to check my mailbox, I left the front door cracked open enough to hear the phone ring. Finally, the day of Halloween arrived and when I went to get my mail, Chris was in his front yard, raking leaves into a pile. I yelled across the street to him.

“Hey man, want to come over and watch some horror movies tonight?” I asked, eager for him to answer questions I’d been simmering on.

“Nah man, I think I’m going to stay home. Wouldn’t want to miss my call, ya know?” 

Like a guilty puppy, Chris wouldn’t look me in the eyes. He left the pile of leaves and walked with some pep back inside. I thought about how strange last Halloween ended and wondered if it made him feel awkward, since today was the day.

The sun set around seven o’clock and Halloween night began its descent on our little neighborhood. I left the curtains drawn to give myself a sense of time and started my horror movie marathon. The darker it became outside, the more anxious I felt, but still I waited patiently. Would death call me tonight? Who might it be? A relative, a stranger? 

The horror movies played on, but I remained trapped in the inescapable thought of the dead calling. Any window light ambience from outside had faded away hours ago, only the mysterious, pitch-black darkness surrounded me now. Time disappeared at a faster pace than normal, and before I could completely drag myself away from my contemplations of life and death, my landline rang. It startled me like a jump scare in a horror movie. 

Death was calling.

Midnight already? I took a quick glance at the clock. 11:30? It was too early. 

*Ring* 

*Ring* 

*Ring*

I rolled off of the couch and bolted for the phone on the kitchen wall. My hand stalled on the receiver for a quick moment, and I wondered if I had adequately prepared myself.

*Ring*

*Ri–* 

“Hello?” my voice cracked, shaking in a confused excitement.

The female voice on the other end poured words out so quickly. “You have to leave! Get out of your house right now! He’s coming! Just go! Run–”

I recognized the voice straightaway and froze. It was Chris’ mother. My mind couldn’t process everything happening at once. How is his mother calling me? I attended her funeral. I saw her buried in the ground. Why is she calling me? Did she dial the wrong number? Wasn’t she supposed to be calling Chris? 

*Bam!*

The sound of a balled fist crashed against my front door and continued to pound savagely. The noise echoed through the house. 

“Don’t answer it! Run out the back! Please, please, you have to listen to me. It’s Chris! Last Halloween I told him that I knew he was the one… the one who killed me. I told him he had to pay for what he’d done. The only time I can communicate is Halloween, but I’m always watching. He thinks you heard me on his call last year. He’s got it in his head that he has to kill you! You have to listen to me!”

*Bam!*

The pounding on the door was more aggressive now, he was also kicking the door. My mind raced. This was too much, the overload of information temporarily paralyzing me. I shrank to the back of the kitchen and hid in the pantry, still holding the telephone receiver. In my overwhelming panic, I didn’t think about the cord still obviously stretching to the phone base on the wall. The pantry door wouldn’t pull to all the way. I heard one of my windows shatter with a crash that made me shake, my eye glued to the crack in pantry door, waiting.

“Hey neighbor! I came over to borrow your phone. I don’t think mine is working.” His voice was raised in a crazed excitement. He kept talking as he walked through the house looking for me. “Mother always said good neighbors are hard to find!” He laughed as I heard my things being tossed around the house. “I have an idea! How about we trade? You give me the phone so I can chat with good old mommy dearest, and I’ll give you this awesome baseball bat!” 

I kept an ear to the phone as my eyes searched wildly through the crack in the pantry door. The voice was getting closer. It wouldn’t be long until I could see him walk into the kitchen. The receiver gripped tight in my hand was shaking uncontrollably, making the spiral cord dance.

*This is the fear they show in movies…* Movies! I have to fight like they do in the movies!

“Wake up! You have to do something! He’s in the living room!” Chris’s mother pleaded with me to make a move.

I began frantically searching around the pantry for something to defend myself. A can of pineapples looked heavy enough and I grasped it tightly, ready to take a chance. Stepping into a defensive stance, I bumped into the wall and my barbecue utensils scattered on the ground. Through the crack in the door, I saw Chris enter the kitchen door frame. Among the scattered barbecue utensils there was a long, sharp two-pronged fork. I quickly swapped the can for it.

*That’s a little better.*

I could see Chris standing in the kitchen, seemingly looking directly at me inside of the pantry. He sang the theme song to Mr. Rogers Neighborhood with his own frightening variation. “Where are you, my neighbor?” He laughed again, amused by his antics. “I see you,” he said, walking to the pantry like a lion in a full-on stalk for dinner. He stopped right in front of the door and peered through the crack, locking eyes with me. He smiled. “I know you overheard Mommy last Halloween.”

“I-I didn’t hear anything, Chris. Please, please, please,” I begged in panic.

“Oh? You haven’t spoken with Mommy? I don’t think that’s true, neighbor. I think you’re lying.” Chris had a disappointed sound in his voice.

“Now! You have to do something now! Stab him! Now!” Chris’s mother whispered on the phone.

“Is that my mother? Oh, do tell her I miss her. I hate that she’s so lonely. Let her know that I’m sending a friend to keep her company,” Chris said with a wicked smirk.

He moved in to get a closer look inside the pantry. This was my chance. I raised the fork to eye level and pushed with all my might through the door. The fork squished through his right eye and hung from his face as we fell into the kitchen counter then onto the floor. He screamed like I’ve never heard a human scream, even in the movies. He rolled on the floor in agony as I scrambled to my feet and bolted out the front door. I ran as fast as my traumatized mind could tell my body to run. I never thought to yell out for help at any time as I put everything I had into running up the middle of the street to safety. After making a turn a block away from my house, I sprinted up the sidewalk and into a neighbor’s yard. I pounded on the front door as hard and fast as I could. Luckily, they were still awake and let me inside. While they called the police, I told them my story. The police burst on the scene ten minutes later and I told my story again.

“So, this all happened inside of your house?” the deputy asked.

“Yes, officer. I left Chris inside after I stabbed him in the eye,” I explained to him. “He’s probably still there.”

“We didn’t find anyone inside. Only a pool of blood in the kitchen. There was something funny, though. An officer said that while he was in the kitchen the phone rang. He said he thought it was odd because the receiver was off the hook. When he put it to his ear, a man was singing the old Mr. Rogers theme song, ‘Won’t you be my neighbor?’.”
