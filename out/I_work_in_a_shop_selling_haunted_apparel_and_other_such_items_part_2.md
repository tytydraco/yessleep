Fun fact about zombies they are in fact spirits that influence dead copses not necessarily the spirit of the corpse itself. So if you could posses the body of anyone who would you choose most zombies chose rich old white men. You ever wonder why there are so many of those guys about. Ever looked at a politician and thought couldn't you just die and let someone younger take charge. Well fun fact they have. But there are some problems with this there are only a few rich old men bodies left so the zombies are getting desperate. 

I bring this up of course because the rich old white man standing in front of my counter if Jeffrey Epstein. 

"Hello" He said sheepishly. 

"Hello mr Epstein." 

"I have recently came upon some information about the former host of this body, and I was wondering if there was anything you sell me to help my situation?" He said trying to keep away from any aligations as of I might not have heard about it already. 

"Yeah. Are you wanting to keep the body or exchange it for another?" 

"I would like to exchange it." 

"Are you looking for another rich old dude or?" 

"I'll take anything at this point just not someone like this if you understand?" 

"Yeah I understand we have a bunch of old frankenstein's monster parts from the whole 5 Minute Crafts craze a few years back. I'm sure we can peice some things together for you." 

Now this may seem like a small shop but it's actually pretty big. We have lots of departments like the coffee shop, garden department, pet section and as previously mentioned in my last post about the monsters hunter the adult section. As we are going through each of them. Lucy from the pet section comes running up to me. Out of breath she quickly says. 

"Hey Jess I've lost a Tailypo!" 

"What's a Tailypo?" I respond having never heard of Tailypo. 

"It's a small furry creature. Yellowish red eyes. Tufted ears. Likes the dark and most importantly." 

She has a slight pause before noticing my customer. 

"Sorry is that Jeffrey Epstein?" 

"He's a rather unfortunate zombie." I respond. "Were getting him some new body parts but if we see the thing you said about we'll either try to catch it or get you." 

"OK" said Lucy. "Just watch out for it's tail." 

So as we get through the rest of the shop we enter the warehouse where we keep the spare body parts. Unfortunately I don't know where the spare body parts are. Fortunately I know that Jack the warehouse manager would know where they are. Unfortunately again I don't know where Jack is. 

"JACK!" I yell into the dark void that is the warehouse. "JACK WHERE ARE YOU!" 

"I AM OVER HERE! WHAT DO IS IT YOU DESIRE" I hear a gruff voice somewhere to the left of me. 

"WE NEED THOSE SPARE FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER PARTS!" I yell over to him. 

"AH YES THE 5 MINUTE CRAFTS CRAZE A FEW YEARS AGO! THEY ARE SOMEWHAT NEAR TO ME JUST FOLLOW MY VOICE!" 

I have to say though it is unusual normally Jack would have lit a torch. Hey there he is. 

We have to look up to see Jack the red dragon peering over us. Standing next to a pile of copses and detached limbs. His large green eyes perfectly suited to finding anything from across the warehouse. And naturally occurring treasure keeping tendencies allowing the warehouse to be perfectly in order. 

"AH HELLO DEAR JESS. LOOKING FOR MONSTER PARTS ARE WE." 

"Yes this unfortunate zombie has possessed a body with some negative associations. So we need a new one." 

"HMM YES THAT IS QUITE A PREDICEMENT. THANKFULLY I HAVE KEPT SOME PARTS SO THEY ARE WELCOME TO BUY A NEW BODY." 

"Yeah I'm sure there are some matching parts here sorry are you OK with Mr Epstein or would you prefer something else." 

"Craig will do." the zombie replied. 

"OK Craig so what will we be getting for you today." 

"Hm I don't really know. I guess just something with a good few years before it decomposes." 

"Yeah so we're wanting something newer. You got an age range in mind? A gender maybe?" 

"Probably something a little older. Male. Preferably black hair if you have any." 

"Yeah OK so would this work for you?" I say as I pull a body out of the pile. 

"Hm yeah that works." Craig says as he sees the handsome mid 40s body with black hair. 

As I look to see another happy customer I notice a small furry yellowish red eyed creature with tufted ears. 

"Craig there's a Tailypo on your head. Please do not move." 

As I slowly edge towards the creature on his head I notice its tail now with a name like the Tailypo you would expect it to have an impressive tail. However not really it was a wiry little thing with strands of hair sticking out of it. Now this was not impressive however the Tailypo ripping its tail of and throwing it at me was both unexpected and impressive. 

"WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?! Oh my god it ripped its tail off." 

I watch as the now tailless Tailypo scampered of in-between shelving units. As I pick up its tail I guide Craig back to the counter promising him use of my staff discount if he doesn't sumon my manager on me or Lucy. 

As I hand the tail to Lucy she looks extremely pleased saying something about how as long as no-one eats it the Tailypo should come back to retrieve their tail. 

As me and Craig return to the counter we we come to the agreement of Â£150 for the body which he agrees is well worth it for no more misunderstandings with any hit men.
