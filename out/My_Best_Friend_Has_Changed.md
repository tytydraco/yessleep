I have known my friend Gary now for over 17 years since we were 11 and started high school and recently he’s started to change.

Me and Gary first met in English class when our teacher sat us next to one another, I was young and eager to make new friends so as soon as we sat down I introduced myself.

“Hi I’m Peter what’s your name?” I said attempting to form some sort of friendship on the first day of school. “Gary” he replied sheepishly clearly riddled with nerves. “Nice to meet you Gary, do you like superhero’s?” I asked him with a grin so wide I’m surprised I didn’t put him off. “Yeah” He blurted out with a bit more enthusiasm. 

After that we spoke all English lesson barely getting any work done. We spoke about the Batman and iron man films that had been released and he told me he had never watched the iron man film. I was shocked and explained to him how I had it on dvd and if he wrote down his mums number and I wrote down my mums number when we got home we could give it to each other the next day and we could arrange a sleepover.

After that we were always together through out high school, college and university. We didn’t speak as much after uni but still kept in contact and would meet occasionally when we had the time and have a few drinks and reminisce.

The last time I saw Gary before the events I will share today was a year ago at the airport after me Gary and our wives all put some savings together and wanted to go and explore some of South America.

On our trip I noticed some small changes but nothing major he started to wince when he got upset or tired and would always cuddle into his wife’s thighs whilst on whatever sofa our accommodation had to offer. I just put it off as him being submissive to his wife, he never did have much confidence so I can’t imagine he would in the bedroom either yet it was off putting having to deal with that for 4 months.

Whilst in Argentina we went to a small Welsh pub and he said to me “Do you remember the day when we walked through he woods after school one day and we saw that dead dog” he said, tone so serious I wouldn’t want to imagine it again. “Y..yeah, why?” I muttered concerned at what might come out of his mouth next. “I think about that a lot. It  sickens me that nobody had the dignity to bury that beautiful creature not even us, why didn’t we do anything Peter? He exclaimed progressively getting louder with each word as locals started to give irritated glances. “We were young man, look it’s getting late let’s get back to the hotel” I said confused by his anger yet understanding in some strange way.

After that night in Argentina i was glad there was only a week left of our trip I started to feel uncomfortable around Gary and his submissive actions so I ended up being pretty distant from the group for the rest of the trip which soured it slightly.

But he was still my best friend.

Recently however Gary has gone through a messy divorce and moved back to our hometown where I still reside. I offered him a drink to catch up and to try lift his spirits but this is when I started to notice some major changes not in his behaviour but in his appearance.

He looked messy the sort of messy you would see in an over the top drama series, his hair was down to his shoulders, his breath smelt awful, his nails were long and looked like an uncleaned bbq grill and he was unhealthy skinny. I chalked this up to him having some form of depression and I was worried for him. I asked him how he was dealing with everything and he explained how it was tough but nice being back home and how his dad had given him a job as a receptionist at the veterinary he works at whilst he gets back on his feet.

Hearing that made me a bit more relaxed as I believed he would get back on his feet but I was still upset having to see him in that state. 

I saw Gary a few more times but it seemed liked every time all he would talk about is the animals that came through the doors of his work how mistreated and how it would cause his blood boil. Overall though it seemed like he was enjoying the job and definitely getting back onto his feet.

Roughly a fortnight ago I got a message from Gary asking if he could stay the night, just chill out have some beers and he’ll crash on the sofa, me and my wife didn’t have an issue with this as it was a Friday so none of us had work the next day. This is a day I have come to regret.

The night went well we all had a good time my wife went to bed and we put iron man on to remind ourselves of why we became friends. At around 2AM I went to bed.

At 4AM I woke back up I heard a strange noise coming from the living room and went downstairs to go and check on Gary, what I saw turned my blood cold. Gary scratching at the door naked on all fours after about 3 minutes he stopped lifted his leg up and pissed all over the door and floor he then crawled away and lied down on the floor like a fucking dog. I was shocked I felt frozen I didn’t know what to do I wasn’t sure if I should confront him or if I should just leave it and attempt to cut contact. I went with the second option although I was horrified I couldn’t embarrass my friend of 17 years like that even if what he did was sick and twisted but maybe he was just drunk I don’t know. 

The next morning I woke up early and asked him to leave and made an excuse that me and Michelle (my wife) had made plans he understood and left I didn’t block him as I didn’t want to be so blunt about it but whenever he offered me to go out I denied and I would only stick to small talk through messages.

Three days ago I received a message from him “I know you know” I was horrified, I felt as if I a spider egg had hatched and crawled all over my skin I wasn’t sure if I felt threatened in some strange way or if he was just admitting his strange i don’t even know how to describe it but I wasn’t sure what to do.

I didn’t tell my wife as to not alert her but I couldn’t sleep that night and I’m glad I hadn’t.

At exactly 3:57AM I heard a familiar noise at the door, scratching the same scratching from a fortnight ago I knew it was Gary I didn’t know what to do should I call the police, should I answer the door, was I just imagining it I didn’t know. Against my better judgment I went downstairs grabbed a knife just incase and waited for the scratching to stop after 4 minutes of constant scratching it stopped a waited for around 20 seconds although it felt like a lifetime and I opened the door what I saw is the most disturbing thing I have seen in my entire 28 years of existence. 

I see a figure wearing a poorly stitched suit made from real dog skin to fit a human being crawling away with a dogs tail also stitched on with a knife in his mouth all of this only illuminated by a single street light.

I called the police immediately and explained the situation but they find nothing I gave them Gary’s information and they interviewed him but found no evidence of anything. 

I can hear him barking outside of my house as I type this message out please someone what should I do.
