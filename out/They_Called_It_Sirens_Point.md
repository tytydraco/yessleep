“Tom O’Neill, a year ago. What, did you really think that I’d be embarrassed to tell you that?” Katie asked.

“See, this is why adults don’t play this.” Em said and Gary nodded in agreement.

I didn’t want to give up yet though. It had come up in conversation that I’d somehow gone all of my seventeen years on this Earth without playing Truth or Dare and when the group had seemed surprised, it’ had made me feel like I’d missed out somehow. It had seemed sensible to drink and hang out on the shore earlier but the fickle September warmth that had showed its face in the early afternoon was now well and truly hidden. I could feel the cold air biting me through my gloves and Em was in so many layers that she looked spherical. Undeterred, I grabbed another beer and spoke up.

“This is only boring because people are picking Truth. I’ll pick Dare.”

Gary pointed to the shoreline.

“I dare you to walk all of the way along those rocks.”

I looked out and even in the half darkness I could just about see what he was referring to because the rocks he'd gestured at were surprisingly well lit. They went out quite far and looked slippery but I wasn’t that drunk and would usually credit myself with above average balance. Before I'd moved to this town I'd been at a high enough level in our local gymnastics club to coach some of the younger students.

“No.” Em said quietly, “Nobody’s doing that.”

Katie nodded in agreement.

“That’s not even funny as a joke, Gary. You’ve had way too much to drink if you’re saying things like that.”

Both of their tones were way too serious and somber for a dare that, whilst being slightly dangerous, didn't seem like that big of a deal. Gary looked sheepish but tried to defend himself.

“I didn’t mean it like that, I just thought it’d be scary. And I only meant it as a joke anyway.”

I was the newest member of our little friendship group but I rarely felt out of place. Right now though I was uncomfortably aware that I was the only one missing something.

“What are you guys on about? Does someone own those rocks or something?”

A little light trepassing didn't seem enough to justify this level of drama but I had nothing else to go on. Nobody spoke for a bit until finally Katie went for it.

“Have you heard of Aokigahara, the suicide forest in Japan? Those rocks are kind of our own version of that. If you walk all the way along it then the water in front of you would be quite deep and, well... it's where women go to drown.”

I shook my head in confusion.

“That makes no sense. Forests can be too big to search or set up a perimeter to stop people going into them. But you’re saying that this is just that one singular spot and that nobody stops them or even sets up a barrier? They just put lights up to, what? Just watch what happens? Come on, I’m not that gullible guys.”

“We shouldn’t be talking about this.” Em said but Gary evidently disagreed.

“It’s called Siren’s Point, you can ask anyone." Gary said, "And if you see a woman out there you aren’t *allowed* to stop her.”

“Not allowed?" I challenged, "Oh, so there’s some super specific law that only exists for this one tiny space? And why do you keep saying women, surely if there genuinely was a popular suicide spot then men would turn up there at least occasionally.”

“Yeah, if it was just a mental health thing and not-” Gary started.

“That bit isn’t true.” Katie said quickly.

Em just sat there glaring at Gary and then shook her head with a small, quick motion.

“There was a witch.” Gary said after a while and I burst out laughing. “No, seriously! A really long time ago there used to be a small port not far from here. Once there was a woman on one of the ships who had dressed up as if she was male but once they discovered that, they kicked her off and accused her of witchcraft. Siren’s Point is where her body washed up and maybe there was something to the claims of witchcraft because ever since it’s been a spot for suicides even though it was fine before. It’s bad luck to get in the way if it happens, too. I think-”

“Gary, just shut up.” Em interjected, “It’s a stupid rumour and not something you should talk about. We shouldn’t be talking about any of this.”

“So it kills women, specifically, because someone murdered a woman? Wouldn’t it make more sense the other way around?”

“Maybe her spirit curses the women because it finds them more similar or-”

Gary was cut off both by my laughter and Em’s sudden raised voice.

“Stop this!” Em yelled, “Stop it now! Stop telling her all of this!”

My happy, drunken mood suddenly turned sour.

“Oh, I see. So It’s fine for you to have your weird little urban legend but *I’m* certainly not to know about it, who knows what the crazy bitch will do if she hears about something spooky. She might run right off the rocks or decide she’s the witch, nobody really knows what tiny thing could set her off.”

The silence had a sort of pressure to it and it held me so firmly I could barely breathe. I’d told them about the bipolar diagnosis because I’d thought they were my friends, that they’d be able to see that I was the same person they’d grown to love even though they now knew I took a couple of pills every day. A cold breeze hurt my face and I realised that it was because it was wet with tears.

“No, Em doesn’t really talk about it with anyone.” Gary said after a while, “It isn’t just you, I shouldn’t have mentioned it.”

“Yeah.” Katie said quietly, “I think maybe the wild rumours are just how people cope. The suicides really happen but it’s grisly and I suppose to some people joking about it or claiming it’s supernatural is just another way of coping. Stopping someone probably isn’t bad luck but stopping someone drowning is difficult under perfect conditions and the rocks aren’t the most stable surface. It isn't a rule or a law, it's just advice. Just to keep us safe.”

This made more sense than anything else they’d been saying. Katie hugged me gently and I began to slow breathing that I hadn’t even realised that I’d sped up.

“I’m sorry. I think maybe I’ve been waiting for one of you to judge me ever since I told you.” I admitted.

“Never.” Gary said and I finally believed it.

"Not everyone's like your parents." Em added.

My parents didn't know I'd seen a doctor at all. They had *interesting* ideas about mental health. As far as they were concerned any mental health condition was either full blown crazy, which was dangerous and should get you locked away, or attention seeking. I'd seen hints of this from them my whole life but their response to the eating disorder of a girl called Helen in my gymnastics club's had cemented my understanding.

"I can't believe her parents are indulging her like that." my father had said.

This was back in the 90's so maybe mental health attitudes in general weren't exactly where they should be. But Helen was alarmingly thin and the 'indulgence' that he was talking about was that her parents had sent her off to some sort of eating disorder rehab place. My mother thought it was a load of fuss about nothing.

"She's only doing it for attention. Her mother said she started wailing when they said they were worried about her. They spoil her too much. If you were that emotional you'd be out."

So when my mental health deteriorated I hid it as best as I could, which only made it worse. I could be perfect but not *consistently* and so my immaculate performance of a normal daughter was marred by explosions of self destructive behaviour. In the end, a friend told me that either I could go to the doctor with her or she was done speaking to me. We went and after I repeatedly asked the doctor to clarify under what circumstances he would tell my parents I began to open up.

"I just get a bit emotional sometimes." I'd said.

But my descriptions of 'emotional' apparently lined up with his idea of 'person who should be given medication and referred to the mental health team.' SInce we'd moved, I hadn't been able to see a counsellor but fortunately continuing to get medication hadn't been a problem and I was basically stable.

The mood on the beach had dampened enough that after another few minutes of talking, Katie suggested it was getting cold and maybe we should all head home. Everyone agreed that they had something to do and somewhere to be rather than admit I'd killed our Truth or Dare game and we went our separate ways.

That night I dreamed of the witch. I saw her standing on the edge of the rocks and though the waves hit her repeatedly and forcefully she never swayed. She beckoned to me and I could have sworn that I'd seen it before. I felt like I'd dreamed of her over and over since coming here and I took one tentative step onto the rocks before waking up.

  
\_\_\_\_\_



In the morning I made myself see sense. I'd dreamed of the witch because she was mentioned, that was all. Sure I thought I'd had the dream more than once, but could I really specifically remember having it before that night? Sometimes things seem more familiar than they are. It was just a dream. Even when it repeated, that was okay. Just a dream.

It could have stayed a dream if Jack *fucking* Smithson hadn't tried to ruin my life. Jack and I had had a very brief but surprisingly intense thing as soon as I'd got here. I'd thought he was nice, he'd thought I was interesting and we were both disappointed in barely three weeks. Fine, whatever. I'd found out he was a bit of a dick and he'd decided that I was a boring, spoiled rich girl. He didn't understand why I had a job when my parents were more well off than most people here. I tried to explain that my parents having money didn't translate to them giving me money for anything that wasn't 100% necessary for survival and that they'd insisted I get a part time job anyway because 'it builds character' but Jack was unimpressed. He had a part time job but his cousin couldn't find one and that didn't seem fair to him.

Maybe you can see where this is going, but I couldn't. When I went to start my shift at the little shop a twenty minute walk away from my house I was floored to see Jack's cousin stood behind the counter. The owner was explaining something to him when I walked in.

"What's he doing here?" I asked.

At least my former boss had the decency to look flustered.

"Ah, we... well, I replaced you. I called your parents so I thought you'd know. It's just that Peter here was interested in the job and when he made me aware of your health condition then it seemed best to replace you. I talked to your parents about it so I thought you'd know."

The words 'health condition' and 'talked to your parents' collided in my head with a force that made me dizzy. Physically, I was a picture of health and so there was only one 'condition' that they could really be talking about. My little mental health secret that I'd shared with trusted friends, but also with the dickhead I'd oh so briefly dated.

I ran home. I don't know why I thought running would make a fucking difference but I ran so fast that the air burned my lungs and I could barely breathe. I tried to open the door.

The chain on the other side held the door in place and after a moment my mother approached.

"We'll have none of that silliness in this house." she said.

That was that. She just walked away again. We didn't talk, she wouldn't respond to my sobbing and she didn't even try to force the door closed. My father didn't come to the door. They just waited inside out of sight for me to leave. And eventually I did.

I walked away quickly but with no clear direction. I'd turn around some corners but skip others and though I was heading more away from civilisation than towards it there was no conscious reason for this. I could have tried to contact my friends. None of us had mobile phones then of course and the only friend whose house I'd actually been to was Katie's, a decent walk away from where I started. But I could have just taken the long walk to her. I could have gone into a shop or pub and tried to convince the owner to let me call one of my other friends on their phone and gone from there. Hell, there was a payphone not far from my parents house that realistically was *probably* broken but I could have checked, it might not have been.

People often don't make smart choices as a teen and even fully grown adults make dumb decisions when they're in pain. If you're thinking about making a judgy little comment about the way I dealt with everything because you're so, *so* much smarter than me then I have a little exercise for you. Get the crossword from todays paper or your little book of sudokus or whatever your puzzle of choice is and take it into the kitchen with you. Now turn on the hob and with your hand on the plate or hovering just over the flames go back to your puzzles and calmly and rationally solve every last one of them. If you do just fine despite the blinding pain from your hand then sure, leave a comment, but after the day I've had I am not in the mood for hypocrites.

It began to rain and it felt like the sky was commiserating with my situation. The droplets fell intermittently for the first few minutes but soon there were more of them and I ran under a nearby bridge. It was only then that the rage hit me. I'd trusted Jack. He knew when I'd told him that I didn't want anyone to know and he knew that my parents knowing would be dangerous. He ruined my life for nothing.

I screamed and hit the wall with one fist, then another. My skin tore, the shock of the impact made my knuckles sing in pain and a sickening feeling radiated from my left thumb because it turns out that your fingers shouldn't be wrapped around your fingers if you're throwing a punch. I kicked the wall with my right foot over and over. I placed my hands against the wall and alternated between sobbing and yelling, looking every bit the unstable crazy person that Jack had made me out to be. Finally exhaustion hit me and I slid down to the floor, my head leant against the bloodied wall.

I don't know if I fell asleep but either way I dreamed. The witch was there, beckoning to me as before but for the first time she spoke.

*Come to me.*

I headed closer to her and yelled.

"What do you want?!"

*You seek revenge. Come to me and you may have it.*

It wasn't a trick. I knew when she spoke to me that there would be a price. I knew that if I wanted to enact some sort of magical vengence on Jack Smithson then I wouldn't be able to live to see how it all played out.

*Come to me,* she said one final time.

I knew that she was asking me to come to Siren's Point. I knew that if I went there then I would die. I knew all that.

But then I woke up, and I went to her anyway.

  
\_\_\_\_\_

  
It was dark by the time I got to the rocks but they were well lit. I should have been able to clearly see whether or not there was anybody at the end but I couldn't. In one glance she'd be there, in another I'd see nobody. I left my bag on the shore and began to walk.

Every step I took out towards the sea made the witch more likely to be there than not. Sometimes she was as she'd appeared to me in my dreams. Other times though she was quite dead, pale and soaked through or bloated and broken by days spent beneath the waves. I didn't want to take my eyes off her but the rocks wwere inconsistent and I needed to make it to the end. Jack ruined my life, I needed to be sure that I ruined his just as much. 

The rocks were underwater now. They had all been uncovered when I'd seen them but it was much later now and the tide was further in. It was getting more and more difficult to see where to put my feet and the water was beginning to reach my knees. Would I need to swim by the end of the Point? If I did, would it still count? It's hardly jumping off the end if you just swim past the point of no return, surely.

The witch was still there though, waiting. I took here presence as confirmation that she would accept my sacrifice just as welcomly in high tide as in low and pushed onwards. My steps were small and purposeful but I was getting closer. 

I tripped and as I pulled my hand out of the water my bracelet nearly came off. Instinctively I grabbed for it in a panic and the futility of the action struck me the moment the jewelry was safely back on my wrist. My friends had got me this bracelet as a birthday gift and I'd barely taken it off since. It wasn't high quality, in fact it was so cheap that my mother despised me wearing it, but I loved it. I slid the bracelet as far up my wrist as it could go and for the first time I thought about what I was doing.

I'm not going to pretend that the magic of friendship saved me that night. I've been in terrible places with lots of friends and for I travelled alone for a while some years later and was perfectly happy. Maybe anything that could have stopped me for a moment would have been enough. Maybe in another world I walked back to the shore that night but was still so broken inside that I returned the night after. All I know is that something in that moment was enough to make me turn around and face the shore. With the water now well over my knees I turned and began to walk away from the witch.

And then a wave came and stole my balance, knocking me down anyway.

The shock of the fall left me flailing madly in the cold water. It wasn't deep but it was chaotic and I couldn't find my way back up. The rocks were close to the surface but inconsistently so -- I would try to place my palm where I thought the ground would be only for it to find nothing there to brace against. My right foot was refusing to let me put any weight on it at all, something I now know was the result of an ankle broken as I fell. And all the while the waves of the tides kept moving me mercilessly, taking away any success I could find.

You can drown in a puddle. It's something I'd been told before but it was only after that night, creeping to close to drowning in water less deep than the kiddie end of a pool that I realised how true it was. I fully believed that I was going to die there. I was going to be yet another victim of Siren's Point and the thing that upset me most back then was the knowledge that I didn't even make it to the end. There was no air left in my lungs and as I clawed weakly above the waves in what I was sure would be my final moments something grabbed me. Hands held my wrist with a grip so tight it should have hurt and pulled. One hand left my wrist and darted under my armpit. An arm was wrapped tightly across my chest like a sash and I was dragged to the shore. 

"Get up," a voice said breathlessly, "I did *not* do all of that just for you to freeze to death out here."

I knew that voice. My head turned weakly to look up at my rescuer and there she was, drenched and out of breath and frankly not looking physically capable of what she'd just accomplished.

Em.

  
\_\_\_\_\_

  
"That isn't how you save someone drowning." Em said once we were safely back at her house.

"How... do you?"

"Not that. I don't know. You aren't meant to touch them in case they pull you under."

"Then why did you?"

"Because it's you."

I pulled absentmindly on the cuff of the shirt I was wearing. Em had had me towel off and put on her dry clothes as soon as we were in the house. They swamped me but it was comforting. She'd made me tea and sat me on the floor in front of the fire to warm up. She looked closely at my hands and face.

"You're bleeding. I don't know first aid. Shit, do we even have any plasters? I mi-"

"Em, how did you know I was there?"

"I watched."

"How did you know I was going to be there?"

"I didn't. I just... watch."

The silence that followed was uncomfortable.

"I don't know what to do," I admitted, "my parents have kicked me out and Jack's told people about me and I've started fucking seeing things, I thought that she was really at the end of Siren's Point and I don't see things, I *don't*, and I don't know what to..."

I was crying too hard to finish. Em took my cup of tea off me before I spilled it.

"I don't know about the other things, but you saw her because she's real. I saw her too, when I tried."

"What? When? How? Why?"

Em took a deep breath.

"There have been points where I haven't been okay. I'm fine now, really. I'm basically fine. But somebody did something to me that I couldn't forgive. The witch said that with my death, she could punish him."

"That's why Katie and Gary said you wouldn't talk about it?"

"They don't know. They just know that I can see Siren's Point from my house. They think that's the reason why I don't like hearing about it."

"Is she really a witch?"

"I think so. I've never been able to find her name or anything about her. Nobody seems to know that. But there are stories that the sailors that killed her claimed she'd cursed them and that every last one of them lost their minds. Once I heard that part of the story I looked into the people who'd killed themselves at Siren's Point in recent years who had any obvious enemies. There's a pattern."

"She drove them mad?"

"It seems that way. I couldn't find links for them all, of course. But I found enough. And nobody who has stopped someone from jumping off Siren's Point has kept their sanity intact."

Panic rose in my throat.

"But you st-"

"You turned back!" Em said and grabbed my hand, smiling for the first time in this conversation, "You changed you mind just like I did! I saw you!"

"That's why you watch, in case people turn back?"

She nodded.

"They don't, often. If they jump then I call the police and let them know so they can get someone out to collect what's left. I don't think anybody goes out there without accepting the price so I'm relying on them changing their minds. The witch is honest, I think. Not *good* but she's offering what seems to be a genuine power, I think she needs the death to... fuel it? If it's supposed to be a gift then that might even explain why they're all women, in a warped kind of way. It's power she wants us to have."

"Why are you telling me all of this?"

"Now that you've seen her, what would be the point in pretending?"

I finished my tea.

"What now?"

"I guess I try and figure out first aid? Maybe I can make bandages out of something."

"I meant with everything."

"I don't know. We should try and sleep and then maybe we can figure everything out tomorrow."

\_\_\_\_\_\_



So that's what we did. When we woke up there was no magical solution but Em called Katie and Gary and together we figured out who I could stay with and for how long. I didn't even try to contact my parents for the first two weeks. I saw a doctor about my ankle and the rest of the cuts I'd sustained. Realising that it was my best chance at escaping my parents, I threw myself into my schoolwork so that I could get into university and succeeded. Whilst at uni I had the first relationship I'd been in to last over two months which was also the first relationship that didn't have me thinking I was madly in love in under a week. I got a job and eventually lost contact with all of my schoolfriends aside from Em.

It took me so long to realise that I was in love with Em that I'm genuinely not sure when I *started* loving her. I know that at the point at which the realisation hit me I'd already loved her for some time. Em had never moved away from her house overlooking Siren's Point and had inherited it when her mother died. When technology and her personal funds allowed it she set up security cameras to watch out for women who might go to visit the witch so that she didn't have to sit by the window. Em took her role as self appointed guardian of Siren's Point very seriously. I visited her often and when an opportunity to take a job that would allow me to work from home fell into my lap I took it without a second thought. It was for a lower salary but taking a paycut that would allow me to live with the woman I loved seemed like an easy decision. I was so fucking happy and there was no way that I could possibly have known that the true horror was yet to come.

Which brings us to now and to why I'm writing this.

Em and I both knew she was sick. Today's appointment was to tell us how sick and what kind of sick. The answers to those questions aren't particularly relevant but if you know that one of us ended up asking "how long?" then I'm sure you'll get the gist. The treatment options open to her might give her more time but they aren't here. And I'm sure as hell not leaving my wife to go through all of that alone so we would be leaving the house empty, except we can't.

As far as Em is convinced, Siren's Point needs a guardian. Somebody to give towels or bandages or mental health resources to anybody who walks into those waves but comes back out. Someone kind, caring... and maybe ideally with lifeguarding experience this time.

It can't be me. It can't be Em. But maybe it could be one of you?

For free rent, would you be willing to do what Em did? Hell, pass a probationary period and you can probably have the house once Em's gone. I doubt I'll be able to face going back to it and the guardian will need to live there.
