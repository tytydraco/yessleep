I take the subway to and from work every day. It’s routine. Nothing special. Just me, a train, and a few dozen exhausted commuters trying to make it through another day.

This all started on Monday night.

\--------

**MONDAY**

He was sitting across from me.

Three seats down. Staring. Grinning.

Not like a normal smile—this was something else. Too wide. Too sharp. His arms rested in his lap, but they were too long, elbows bending at the wrong angles. His fingers were thin and segmented, almost like extra joints had been slipped in where they didn’t belong.

I tried to ignore him. Focused on my phone. But I could feel his eyes.

And when I got off the train, I made the mistake of looking back through the window.

He was still staring.

**--------**

**TUESDAY**

There were two of them now.

The long-armed man was in the same seat. But next to him was a woman with wax-pale skin, stretched too tight over her skull. And beneath the harsh train lights, I swear I saw veins shifting beneath her skin, like something was crawling inside.

Neither of them blinked. Neither of them moved.

I called my friend Luke.

*"Dude, it’s the subway. Creeps are part of the package."*

I laughed, even though I didn’t feel like laughing.

But when I got off the train that night, I glanced at the window again.

They both waved.

**--------**

**WEDNESDAY**

I took a different carriage this time.

Didn’t matter.

There were *four* of them now.

The grinning man. The waxy woman. A bald guy with an open-mouthed smile that never moved. And a kid with solid black eyes.

I held onto the pole near the door, heart hammering. They didn’t move with the train. Every normal commuter swayed with the motion, shifting their weight.

They didn’t.

And in the morning?

They were there too.

I stepped onto the train, still half-asleep, and felt it instantly.

Too many still, watching bodies scattered through the carriage. Some were sitting. Some were standing.

All of them were grinning.

By the time I got to work, I felt sick.

That night, I called my mother.

*"Something’s happening,"* I said. *"People are... wrong."*

She just sighed. *"Honey, you work too much. You’re overtired. Get some rest."*

She sounded bored. Like she wasn’t even really listening.

\--------

**THURSDAY**

They’re *everywhere.*

At the coffee shop, the barista’s wrists had too many fingers growing from them.  
At lunch, I saw a man take multiple, huge bites of his sandwich without chewing.  
On the street, a homeless man’s face looked like rotting wax, sagging and shifting as he turned toward me.

I gave Luke an update.

*"Okay, that’s actually messed up,"* he admitted. *"Maybe it’s a prank?"*

I was about to agree.

And then he said—

*"Or maybe you’re just seeing them for what they really are now."*

I laughed, but it came out forced.

*"What?"*

He shrugged. Too casual. Too normal.

*"Nothing, man. Just saying."*

\--------

**FRIDAY**

It was late when I left the office.

Everyone else had gone home except Karen, the receptionist. She sat at her desk, scrolling on her phone, half-asleep as I walked by.

*"Night, Karen,"* I muttered.

She didn’t respond right away. And when she did—when I was almost past her desk—her voice sounded... wrong.

*"Night."*

I turned back to glance at her.

And in the dim light, her shadow-stretched face looked too smooth. Too pale.

Her smile was too wide. Her eyes too dark.

My stomach dropped. I kept walking. Didn’t run, didn’t react.

But I knew.

She was one of them.

**--------**

**SATURDAY**

I woke up praying I was losing my mind. That this was some stress-induced breakdown.

But the second I stepped outside, I knew I was screwed.

They were everywhere now.

Not just some. Not a few.

Everyone.

The coffee shop. The gas station. The people waiting at the bus stop. The couple walking their dog—except the dog had *human* eyes.

I called my mum.

I don’t know why. I just—I needed to hear her voice.

She picked up on the second ring.

*"Mum—"* I whispered. *"Something’s wrong. I think I need help."*

Silence.

And then, in the same flat, tired tone she used earlier this week—

*"Oh, honey,"* she murmured. *"We’ve been waiting for you to notice."*

I hung up.

I saw no other option.

I took a cab to the hospital, my hands shaking.

*"I need help,"* I told the receptionist. *"Something’s happening to me. To everyone."*

She gave me a long, slow smile.

Her lips didn’t stop stretching.

*"Of course,"* she murmured. *"Come right this way."*

She led me down a dimly lit hallway, past rooms where doctors with grinning faces hovered over patients, too many hands pulling at their skin.

I turned to run—

And a nurse grabbed my wrist.

Her fingers were too long. Too strong. Her grip sent ice through my veins.

*"You don’t need to be afraid,"* she whispered.

Her mouth opened too wide. Too wide. *Too wide.*

I ripped myself free.

I ran.

I don’t know how I got out.

I don’t remember the streets, or the subway, or unlocking my front door.

But I’m here now.

And I can hear them *outside.*

**--------**

**SUNDAY**

They knock every few minutes.

Not pounding. Just… gentle tapping.

I don’t know what’s happening.

I don’t know if I’m crazy. If something changed in me, or in the world itself.

I just need to know—has anyone else noticed them?

Please.

If you’re still normal, if you still see people the way they’re supposed to be—tell me.

Tell me they haven’t gotten to you too.
