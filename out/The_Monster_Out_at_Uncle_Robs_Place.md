I think I was about 7 or 8 at the time when this occurred. My parents had been divorced since I was 5 and so they had shared custody of me. My dad had me for the weekend and every other week, typically on a Friday, we would go out to my uncle Rob's, who lived in the sticks. My dad and him and a few other guys would meet and go to his garage in the back to shoot the bull, smoke, and play either poker, ping pong, darts, or whatever. I always liked this because I got to stay up a little later and got to visit my cousin Cassie. Plus we went to Blockbuster and he let me rent a couple of movies, get a couple of Reese's Peanut Butter cups, and we had Mickey D's for dinner on the way up.

We made the 45 minute drive out into the boonies and I got excited when dad drove up the long driveway and I could see the dim amber glow of uncle Rob's porch light. We parked next to two other pickup trucks and I immediately got out with my Blockbuster sack of Reeses and two movies, rushed to the door, and rang the doorbell. My dad was just coming up the steps of the porch when my cousin Cassie greeted us and let us in. I hugged her and went to bear-hug uncle Rob as he kneeled down to greet me.

"Ah, you're getting big, Mikey! Your daddy feeding you Miracle-Gro?" Uncle Rob said jokingly as I hugged him as tight as I could.  
"We had McDonald's!" I blurted out.  
Afterwards, my dad and uncle Rob greeted each other and made their way to the kitchen where all the other guys were.  
Before he did, my dad kneeled down to me and said "Alright, kid. You know the rules. You behave yourself, ok?"  
"I will." I replied assuredly.  
"Alright, we're going out back now. Remember, the two-way by the backdoor."  
"I will." I repeated. My dad and the guys made their way out the backdoor and towards the garage.

Cassie and I made our way into the living room and I gave her one of the Reese's and the movies.  
"What do you wanna watch first? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Aladdin?" I asked, presenting the VHS covers to her.  
"I wanna watch Turtles!" She replied. I then handed her the movie and she went to go turn the TV on and put the movie in the VCR.  
"I'm gonna make some popcorn." She said as she ran into the kitchen. I just sat on the couch and watched the previews.  
A few minutes later, the movie had just started and she brought out the popcorn in a plastic green bowl and we shared it along with the Reese's while we watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  
  
I think it was more than an hour later and Cassie said that she had to go to the bathroom. She left the room and I stayed watching the movie. I was resting my head on the arm of the sofa and I suppose I nodded off while the movie was playing.

I then slowly started to wake up and stretched my arms and legs. I then noticed that the TV displayed static and the soft white noise emanating from it. I looked around the room and noticed that the living room lights were off but the kitchen light was illuminating from the next room. I then realized that Cassie was nowhere to be found.  
"Cassie?" I called out to her but there was no response. I call out to her again and there was still no response.  
I began to yell out to her but there was still no response. I didn't know what to make of this so I got up from the couch and called out to her while walking into the kitchen. It was all too quiet except for the ceiling fan still spinning and wobbling. I looked up at the clock hanging on the wall above the fridge and saw that it was past 9:30.

I couldn't tell if I was reading the time right or if the clock was broken but I could see the second hand ticking. I went back into the darkened living room and looked on the digital display of the VCR and it read 9:34PM. Usually, my dad and I would've been on the road by now around that time and he would have me in bed by 10.  
"CASSIE!" I shouted almost at the top of my lungs. I then felt this dread creeping onto me, as if I was all alone in this house. Where did she go? I've had no responses to my continuous yelling for her.  
I went to the bathroom door and saw in the space below that the light was still on.  
"Cassie?" I knocked on the door. "Are you in here?" But there was no answer back.  
I opened the door to the bathroom and saw that the light was still on. She wasn't in here either.  
I then went to the two-way radio near the backdoor and pressed the button to speak.  
"Dad? Uncle Rob? Are you there?" I released the button but there was only the white noise of static. After waiting for a response, I tried again.  
"Dad! Uncle Rob! Are you there!?" I asked, edging on desperation and fear.  
I looked out the window of the back door and saw the outside and inside lights of the garage were still on. I tried the radio again but there was still no answer from anyone. Just static.

The thought of going out to the garage at night was already creepy enough. Did I really have to make my way to the garage by myself in the dark? I tried the radio a few more times before giving up on it and concluded that I would have to go to the garage... In the dark... By myself. I wanted Cassie to be here with me. I wanted my dad and uncle Rob. I didn't want to be here anymore.

I forced myself to open the backdoor then the screen door. I stuck my head out, scanning my immediate surroundings. After seeing the coast was clear, I slowly stepped out onto the back porch and I started shivering, even though it was a warm September night. I cautiously made my way down the backdoor steps and my body tensed up. I crept towards the light of the garage trying not to make any crunching noises under my feet. I then realized, as I was trying to keep silent, that I normally heard crickets and all that but it was all eerily quiet. I felt like I was completely alone. It felt like the garage was a mile away and I was completely on edge with every step I took. I quickened my pace as soon as I was close to the light of the garage and burst through the door.

"DAD!" I yelled as soon as I entered the garage but there was no one here. The smell of cigarette smoke wafted in the air, the radio was playing the country music they usually listened to, there were playing cards left scattered on the table, but where did everyone go? Where's uncle Rob? Dad? Where is everyone!? The dread started to creep more into me and I swear I was just about to panic.

Suddenly, I heard the muffled, distant noise of a gunshot echoing outside that broke my train of thoughts. Then another one. Then several more to where I got so scared that I ran back into the house as fast as I could and slammed the door behind me. I then heard a couple more gunshots but then I heard a high-pitched shriek which made my blood run cold and I turned to look outside the window, keeping my head low.

I didn't see anything but I could hear another distant shriek. I've never heard anything like this before. I had a feeling that it wasn't an owl or a deer or anything that I've heard out here on uncle Rob's place. I then could hear some shouting echoing. Dad? Uncle Rob? I searched for anything to appear in the garage's outside light but several minutes passed and there was nothing. I then walked into the kitchen, lifted myself up on the sink, and looked out the window.

I continued to look out into the darkness until I heard my name.  
"Mikey!" I heard a voice coming from outside.  
"Mikey!" It sounded like Uncle Rob. I was looking out to see if I could see him but nothing came into view.  
A few minutes passed and I heard uncle Rob calling my name again, "Mikey!"  
I was about to run outside to call back out to him until I saw a shadowy figure from a distance. I couldn't make out exactly what it looked like but I could see it was a tall, lanky figure that lurched stiffly and... so inhuman. I froze staring at this thing moving across the yard, twitching disgustingly and I think I heard it hiss that I felt the hairs on the back of my neck sticking up.  
"Mikey!" It was uncle Rob's voice but this wasn't uncle Rob that I was seeing out the window. It turned its head towards me and I saw the eyeless face of a monster! I panicked and I fell onto to the floor, struggling to get myself in a kitchen cabinet.

I was able to hide in a cabinet where I had an angeled but clear view of the kitchen window and I watched the window through the crack of the slightly open cabinet door. I don't know how much time had passed but nothing was happening and I began to calm down. I was about to come out when I suddenly saw the monster's head appear at the window and a cold shiver instantly went up my spine and the hairs stood back up again. It pressed its hideous pale, eyeless face against the glass and slid its face around as if trying to get a better view inside.

The face looked almost horse-like but the muzzle was shorter and gaunt. Its bared its teeth but I don't think it had any lips or anything that would hide them. Its nostrils flared and would leave fogged spots that quickly dissipated on the window.  
"Mikey!" It barely moved its mouth to speak using uncle Rob's exact voice.  
"Mikey!" The sound of uncle Rob's voice coupled with its grotesque face had me totally unsettled. Why did it sound like uncle Rob?  
"Let me in, Mikey!"  
Oh hell no! There was no way I was leaving this cabinet to let that creature in!

Suddenly, I heard a couple of gunshots ringing out along with some men yelling. The creature let out a shriek as it fled away from the window. As soon as I heard it shriek, I almost vomited. How can something like this exist? Why was it here?! And how did it know my name?

Soon the shrieking faded away in the distance and a couple of the men shouting to each other whilst I still hid in the cabinet. Moments later, I heard the back door fly open and my dads voice calling.

"Michael!" He called out. "Michael! Where are you?!" He sounded frantic. I didn't come out as believed that it was that pale monster until I saw my dad come into the kitchen.  
"Michael!" He called out and I immediately spilled out of the cabinet onto the floor.  
"DAD!" I responded. He picked me up off the ground and threw me over his shoulder.  
"We gotta go, Michael!" He said with a panic that I've never heard before in his voice. He carried me out the front door and to his pickup where he opened the drivers side and actually threw me in onto the passenger's side as he hopped in and started the truck.

We peeled out of the driveway and sped off onto the dirt road.  
"Dad, what's going on!?" I started to cry.  
"I'll tell you later. We need to get out of here first!" His eyes never left the road.  
All I did was held my arms and cried as my dad was driving us out.

Some time later, we were back on the smooth paved road heading home and everything started to calm down at that point. Dad turned his head to look behind him and he let out a sigh of relief. He turned to me and asked, "You ok, Mikey?" His voice now took on a calmer and fatherly tone.  
"What's happening? What was that monster?" I sniffled, wanting an explanation.  
My dad turned to look at the road and shook his head.  
"I don't know, Mikey." He said in a tone that unsettled me once again. "I... don't know. All I knew was that I had to get you out of there."  
"What about Cassie?" I inquired.  
"Uncle Rob's gonna take care of her. He told me to get you out of there while he and everyone else hunted that thing down." He replied.  
"Did you see her?" I prodded more.  
"... No. Can't say that I had. I'm sure she's safe, Mikey." He assured me but I was still worried.

We had driven so many miles down the road and we started to see the lights from the town that we're returning to.  
"Listen," My dad broke the silence, which made me jump a little.  
"For now, don't tell your mom what happened. I'll do that. We called the police a while ago and they should be on their way to help out uncle Rob. I'm sure we'll hear from them tomorrow, ok?"  
"... ok." I replied, still worrying about Cassie and uncle Rob.

There was not a word said between us on the rest of the drive home.
