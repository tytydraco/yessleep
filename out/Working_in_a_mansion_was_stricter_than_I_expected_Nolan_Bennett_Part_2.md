Ever since I was young, I have always adored movies, especially those in the horror genre. They held a special place in my heart, mainly because we were forbidden from watching them in the orphanage.

One day I snuck out and managed to watch a zombie movie. I can’t recall its name, but it was one of the best experiences of my life. The sound of gunshots accompanied by the sheer sense of dread, served as an escape from my own horror story.

I found myself relating to the characters, closely observing them as they explored their own version of a world devoid of happiness.

However, as Nolan continued to unload bullets into the walking monstrosities, I was anything but excited. I stood behind him as the sound of gunshots pierced my eardrums.

*“What the hell is going on?!”* I shouted.

*“I’m just as confused as you are! This has never happened before! Not here anyway!”*

With all exits blocked, I started to fear for the worse. I honestly believed we would be safe after exiting the mansion grounds. It seemed I was very mistaken. Though this time, things were significantly different. All my life, whenever danger came, I always had to confront it alone. I had no one to depend on in a time of crisis.

Nolan, however, reassured me. He was a remarkable shot, accurately aiming and reloading at incredible speeds. This was just like a movie.

*“Ben, get me that gun on the wall behind you! And load it up while you’re at it!”*

I looked behind me to discover a shotgun hanging on the wall with some spare ammo in the table nearby.

*“I don’t know how to load guns!”* I protested, as my trembling hands struggled to place the bullets.

*“Well, you better figure it out! Because I’m gonna run out of ammo soon!”*

With the horde trimmed down to nine, I tried my best to load the bullets into the gun. We still had a chance to make it out of this in one piece. I was so close, so close to escaping this fucking place. There was no way I was dying right at the finish line.

I stood up to pass him the gun, when a hand grabbed me through the window. A man that was missing half his head had a strong grip on my collar. Using inhuman strength, he repeatedly bashed my head against the edge of the window, trying to pull me out of the cabin.

In a swift motion, Nolan fired a headshot and grabbed the shotgun from my hand. Blood began to trickle down from the side of my head.

*“Are you okay?!”* He asked, while firing the shotgun.

*“I guess so!”* I was feeling somewhat lightheaded but otherwise fine.

I took a quick peek outside, there were only three remaining. *“Keep going man, I think they’re almost done!”*

Despite this surprise attack, we managed to hold our ground. Even though it was Nolan who did most of the work. I wondered what the host would think of this outcome. I was willing to bet my life it wasn’t expecting things to turn out as they did.

All of a sudden, Nolan stopped shooting.

In front of us, one man dressed in a security outfit alongside two teenagers stood out compared to the other monstrosities. They looked completely normal, not a single wound on them. Basically, nothing compared to the walking corpses Nolan shot.

Maybe they were ordinary people alarmed by the gunshots?

On the other hand, the axe held by the security guard told a different story. “Nolan, I think they’re dangerous as well!”

Nolan was silent, his eyes wide open like those of a deer caught in headlights.

*“Hey, hey! Nolan! Snap out of it!”*  I tried shaking him, but he wouldn’t even look at me.

***“Are you enjoying yourself man? I see you even made a new friend.”*** One of the teenagers said.

They could even speak. “N-No… that’s not…” Nolan’s words were barely audible.

They charged toward us, prompting Nolan to finally react by firing at the security guard. He, however, couldn’t bring himself to shoot the other two. As a result, one of them wrestled with Nolan while the other tackled me to the ground, with both hands pressing against my neck.

I couldn’t breathe and getting him off me felt impossible. Urgently looking around me, there was nothing I could use. The guns were far away from me, and punching didn’t work either. Desperately gasping for air, one word surfaced in my mind. It was a word I had hopelessly tried to ignore.

***Death.***

The cabin’s walls began to close in on me. My eyes rolled back as the lack of oxygen made everything grow darker and darker.

Please, I don’t want to die. Not like this. Please…

Dad… Your son is scared…

This whole fucking life of suffering, what’s the point if I just die here? Was all this pain for nothing? Were all my dreams that insignificant in the end?

***…***

Suddenly, I felt the pressure disappear and I took a long deep breath as I clutched my neck. It was Nolan, he pushed that guy off me.

“Ben, if you don’t go now, you’re going to miss the opportunity to escape. ***PLEASE GO!***” He shouted as he grappled with his life on the line.

I had no energy left to argue, so I decided to put my faith in him. With slow, deliberate movements, I crawled out of the broken window, the shards cutting into my skin. Never mind that.

With each breath, my speed grew, and I started sprinting down the road. As I stumbled away from the cabin, the cold air stung my throat with each inhale. I could feel my hands were soaked in blood, but I couldn’t bring myself to stop running. I briefly glanced back at the cabin.

***There were five more outside.*** They were smiling at me while waving in perfect synchronicity. Shortly after, they entered the cabin.

I was terrified. Terrified of dying. Exhausted from all the struggles I had been through. The trees blurred past me as I dashed through the snow, each step a struggle against my trembling legs. In a few moments I would be out of this forest. I would escape this hell with my life intact. I could finally rest…

All I had to do was continue straight ahead.

“And then what?”

What do you mean what? I would find another job probably… Yes, I hated my life outside the mansion but that was infinitely better than what I had just experienced.

That’s right, don’t forget that Nolan put all this effort into helping me escape…

*“My sister doesn’t have a lot of time left. She has cancer and as you can imagine, hospital fees are expensive.”*

Shut up, there’s no way I’m going back. He’s insane, remember? The same guy that would’ve kept you there until you ‘entertained’ him. He used me all along.

*“Are you okay?!”*

*“Ben, if you don’t go now, you’re going to miss the opportunity to escape.* ***PLEASE GO!****”*

***Seriously, shut up…***

***…***

***…***

I lied. I didn’t put my faith in him. Truthfully, I blatantly used him as bait while I made my escape. He used me and I used him, so it made sense right?...

That’s what fair trade is. Yes! Nice and simple! He used me for his goal so why not use him for mine?!

***…***

I didn’t get it. Not one bit.

I had never fired a gun before, so it took me by surprise when I experienced recoil from shooting. My open wounds didn’t help much either. After a few loud bangs there was silence. Nolan stood speechless as he stared at me with great intensity.

“Ben… why the hell did you come back?” To say he looked like a mess would be an understatement. He was all beat up, with his hands restrained behind his back.

I didn’t want to know what those things were planning on doing to him. Probably something to do with the axes they held over his throat.

“I… don’t know.” I was surprised myself.

“Maybe I can still make it.” I prepared myself for a second round of running.

“No, no… ***YOU FUCKED IT UP YOU IDIOT!***”

***“OH, FUCK YOU NOLAN!”***

***“NO, FUCK YOU BEN! YOU FUCKING WASTED YOUR CHANCE OF ESCAPING.”***

***“IT’S YOUR FAULT YOU FUCKING MORON! WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU BACK THERE?! WERE YOU PLANNING ON DYING HERE BEFORE YOUR SISTER IS THAT IT?!”***

He was speechless. That might have been too much on my part. We both panted, exhausted from what we had just gone through.

I untied his hands, and I helped him to the truck. Despite having missed my chance of escaping, for some reason I was feeling something completely unexpected. I was happy. Very faintly, but I was happy.

Why the hell was I happy? I was going back to that shitty mansion, having wasted a rare chance.

***…***

Oh, I see now. I was happy I had survived. It may have been a bad outcome, but I was alive. Besides, Nolan mentioned he goes for supplies every now and then. If that were the case, maybe we could try again in three days?

With that in mind, I started to feel hope. If I had something to look forward to, I believed I could survive another two or three days. As long as I could escape in the end. I had done it once anyway, right?

I turned to Nolan, who I hadn’t exchanged a single word with, ever since we exited the cabin. I really couldn’t understand him.

“Fuck you Nolan.” Was all I could come up with.

He glared at me, seemingly too pissed off to reply.

I sighed. “You saved my life, twice now. Surely, I could repay the favor?”

His expression softened a bit, but he still wouldn’t talk. “What happened back there, when those four showed up?” I believed I deserved to know, since he almost got us killed.

He took a deep breath. “Do you really want to know?”

I nodded. “Remember how I told you, that my sister’s hospital fees are expensive? Well, I didn’t come to this place for a job, I came here to rob it with my two friends. It seemed like the perfect target since it was isolated, aside from the rich family and all.

Well, my friends weren’t very certain about this little heist I had in mind. I convinced them however, and after reaching the manor, we got attacked by those walking corpses. My two friends ended up dead and that security guard ended up saving me.

However, he died shortly after due to breaking a fucking rule. He ‘wasn’t allowed to let any intruders in.’ In other words, it was all my fault those three became walking corpses, the ones we saw.

These two were my best friends… I had known them since we were little, and I led them to their deaths. All for my benefit, just like a parasite. I needed them and I used them.

I fed off them all those years and their time finally came. I killed them, just like a fucking parasite…”

I took a moment to think about all my interactions with him so far. “Are you sure you’re a parasite?”

He stopped the car and turned to me. “That’s exactly what I am Ben. Don’t deny my nature.”

“You look more like a human to me. I mean, going by your logic I’m a parasite too. You used me to entertain yourself and I used you as bait. I needed you to escape and you needed my story. Maybe we’re all parasites?”

“Ben, I destroy the people around me. My friends… I’m not worthy of friends nor my sister. What is even the point of this life?”

I ran a hand over my face. “I don’t fucking know Nolan. I don’t get it, so I don’t wanna think about it.”

Nolan was starting to look more and more human, gradually shedding his parasitic front. Or was he?

He was a human that gave me both hope and despair. Yet, we held the same opinions on a number of things.

As much as I didn’t want to admit it, if I was going to survive in this mansion, I would need some psychological support. Because, if the host were to show me the orphanage again…

Having said that, I felt as though I was drawing closer to a conclusion about him. There was just one last thing I wanted to confirm.

“Do you feel guilty about me not escaping?”

“Yes…”

“Then make it up to me. Help me get out of this mansion. Until I escape, feed off me and I’ll feed off you.

“…You don’t understand.”

*“Look, I can’t be your Goddess, but I can try being your friend.”*

I never had any experience with friends. I wasn’t even sure if that was the right call. Trying something different for once may turn out to be beneficial.

He had no reply. Instead, he was getting teary eyed. “Dude, don’t fucking cry you’re making me embarrassed.”

“I’m sorry Ben…I’m the worst.”

After entering the dreaded mansion once more, we sat in the security booth. My body and mind were in dire need of recovery. There would be more pain in the future, but I could at least hold on to that fateful day.

The moment I finally step out of the forest will undoubtedly mark the happiest moment of my life.

The sun was still up, however I don’t think I had any energy left for anything else. At least for today anyway.  Maybe I could convince Eleanor to let me rest?

“Let me know when you get another chance to go for supplies. This time hopefully it won’t go as bad.”

Nolan was facing the ground, his shoulders slumped. “Nolan? You good?”

“I’m sorry Ben, this is all my fault.”

I sighed. “It’s fine, I didn’t make it but we came back in one piece, right? Let’s just try again in a couple days.”

He covered his face with his hands. “Ben… check your rule list.”

“My rule list?”

I took out my notebook and at first glance nothing looked out of the ordinary. One particular line caught my attention. I stopped reading.

My body started to grow warm as I repeatedly read the same line over and over, hoping I somehow misread it the first time.

***Rule 4: You may not exit the mansion grounds*** ***~~without permission from the mansion head.~~*** ***under any circumstances.***

Huh?

Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh? Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?Huh?

“What… is the meaning of this?”

“Once per year, the host can update one of our rules… I’m sorry.”

Huh?

“Then… Does that mean I’m… stuck here forever?”

Nolan wouldn’t respond. Oh my God.

The whole world began to slow down. But there was no anger, no sadness, no happiness. Huh?

How can there be nothing? Surely there’s something, maybe I just don’t feel it.

Nolan’s lips were moving but no sound came out. Was he mocking me? No wait, I can’t hear anything actually. I can hear my heartbeat, so perhaps that’s good enough?

I exited the security booth and stepped into the attic. I had no idea how long I stood there but I could also feel something warm running down my cheeks. What is it? I think tears.

If that’s the case, then I am actually feeling something. That is infinitely better than nothing. Hm? There’s also a shiny object in the corner of my eye.

Oh, it’s a full moon. Now that’s pretty. There’s not a single cloud either, but what would be the appropriate thing to do on this cozy winter night? Drink hot cocoa? Watch a movie?

*…*

***Maybe I should just die on this cozy winter night.***

Wait a sec, it appears there's someone here to see me.

An eyeball?
