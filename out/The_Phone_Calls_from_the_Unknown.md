It started innocently enough. I was home alone one night, scrolling through social media when my phone buzzed with a call from an unknown number. I almost ignored it but, out of curiosity, I picked up.

“Hello?” I said, my voice shaking slightly.

Silence. Just a heavy breathing on the other end. I hung up, dismissing it as a prank call. But then it happened again the next night. And the next. Each time, I answered, and each time, it was the same eerie breathing. No words, no sounds, just the sensation of someone—something—on the other end.

I tried to ignore it, but dread crept in. I googled the number, but nothing came up. I considered blocking it, but something compelled me to keep answering. I wanted to confront whatever it was, to demand an explanation.

One night, I finally gathered enough courage. I answered and shouted, “Who are you? What do you want?”

The breathing stopped. A moment passed, and then a voice—a low, distorted whisper—slithered through the phone, “I’m watching you.”

My heart dropped. I felt my skin crawl. I slammed the phone down, hyperventilating. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. I bolted every door and turned off all the lights, hoping to hide from whatever was tormenting me.

Days passed without any more calls, but the paranoia lingered. I convinced myself it was over until one evening, as I was watching TV, I got a knock on the door. My heart raced. I peeked through the peephole but saw no one. I hesitated, then called out, “Who is it?”

Silence. My mind raced through possibilities. I convinced myself it was just my imagination. I sat back down, trying to focus on the show. But then my phone buzzed again—a message from an unknown number.

“Look outside.”

Panic surged through me. I grabbed the nearest object, a lamp, and approached the window. I pulled the curtain back just enough to peek outside. My breath caught in my throat. There, illuminated by the streetlight, stood a figure—a shadowy silhouette with no discernible features.

I stumbled back, heart pounding in my chest. My phone buzzed again, and I fumbled to read the message.

“Don’t be afraid. I just want to play.”

I dialed 911, my hands shaking. As I waited for the operator to answer, I glanced back outside. The figure was gone, but the air felt heavy, charged with dread.

When the police arrived, I told them everything, but they found nothing. No sign of an intruder, no footprints, nothing out of the ordinary. They assured me it was probably just a prank and left, but I could feel the unease settling back into my bones.

That night, I locked every door and turned off my phone, hoping to escape the nightmare. But sleep eluded me. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, counting the minutes until dawn.

Around 3 a.m., I finally drifted off, only to be jolted awake by my phone ringing. I groaned, my heart racing. I glanced at the screen—it was that same unknown number.

Against my better judgment, I answered.

“Hello?”

A chilling laugh echoed through the speaker, sending ice through my veins. “You can’t hide from me. I’m always watching.”

The line went dead. My heart raced as I tried to make sense of what was happening. I threw the phone across the room, and it shattered against the wall.

That’s when I heard it—a soft tapping, coming from my window. I couldn’t breathe. The sound was steady, rhythmic, like a heartbeat.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I grabbed my keys and rushed out of the house, not stopping until I reached my neighbor's porch. I banged on the door, shouting for help.

They let me in, confused and worried, but I couldn’t explain. I just sat there, trembling, waiting for dawn to break.

As the sun rose, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. I thought maybe I had escaped whatever nightmare had come to torment me. But when I got home, the door was wide open.

Inside, everything was untouched—except for my shattered phone lying on the floor. And next to it, a single note written in a shaky hand: “You can’t escape me.”
