[\[Part 8\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1amutfk/the_children_of_the_oak_walker_part_8/)

My breath came in short, shaky gasps, and I put down the wrench to feel for my submachine gun.

*We are so screwed, we are so screwed, we are so screwed.*

Engines revved all around me, gunfire continued to ring from the various truck windows and firing slots, but with all the lights extinguished, it seemed as though I’d been struck blind. Acrid smoke from burned gunpowder hung on the air inside the armored compartment, and I could feel the same apprehension in the muted breathes of the others in the truck, a creeping terror that followed on the heels of reality.

Daylight was several hours away, and we didn’t have that kind of time.

*“Rhino 1, this is Hilltop, we’ve got units inbound to assist you, and a howitzer crew on standby. Can you move far enough for us to have a clear shot, over?”* Through the speakers, Sean spoke in the deep, calm tones of a policeman, though I knew everyone on his side of the radio would be scrambling.

*“Negative, Hilltop.”* Chris radioed back, and I thought I caught the slightest crack in his voice over the airwaves, almost imperceptible beneath the roar of his rifle in the background. *“They’ve got us pinned down. It’s not just mutants, I think we have—Oscar, don’t!”*

Light flickered from somewhere up ahead, and to my horror, I watched Chris’s driver push his door open to climb out.

The flashlight on the end of his rifle shone brightly against the dark, but it wasn’t pointed out into the night. Instead, Oscar held his rifle at his side, aimlessly pointing the beam at the ground without his finger anywhere near the trigger. He stared out into the abyss with a blank, emotionless gaze, and Oscar stuck one boot out to step down into the mud.

Dread soaked my mind like ice water, and I waited for the surge of teeth to come for him.

*What is he doing?*

His boot heel touched the ground, and the roars of the Birch Crawlers stilled, the thunder of their charge dissipating all at once.

Like a blanket of lead, the silence settled over our convoy, each gun petering out as the shadows went motionless. With the tumbling rain, I struggled to see anything further than a few yards away, even with the light mounted on my Type 9, but I could make out thin shapes in the gloom.

Oscar took a step away from the truck.

Gray hands reached out from the dark, close to a dozen with chipped fingernails and black scabs over their cuts. Their fingers danced over his arms and shoulders, poking and prodding at him in an almost playful way, though from how others gripped Oscar’s wrists, I doubted he could have pulled away if he tried.

His rifle light flickered off, and Oscar vanished.

*“Stay in your trucks!”* Chris bellowed through the radio, his truck door slamming after Oscar’s departure, but something began to trickle in over the drumming rain, a hoarse, dull noise that I could barely discern over the rumble of the diesels.

Sitting on the floor of the armored compartment next to Zach, I swallowed a sour lump of fear, and hugged my submachine gun closer.

*It’s not real, it’s all in your head, it has to be.*

“D-Do you hear that?” Zach’s words came out ragged and shallow, though I didn’t reply. I didn’t have to.

For in that moment, the sound increased in volume, enough to be unmistakable, along with the blood-curdling scratch-scratch of fingernails on metal.

Whispers.

Hundreds of whispers, just on the other side of the armor plating, filled with unintelligible words. They raked grimy fingers over our trucks in slow, deliberate swipes, and a sensation of being watched flooded over me.

Too scared to stay motionless, I rolled to a crouch, eye level with the nearest gun slit.

With a trembling hand, I raised my Type 9, and clicked the flashlight taped to its barrel on.

*Mother of God.*

A sea of white round eyes gleamed back at me, wide grins stretched over pallid faces tucked between oily curtains of black, rotted hair. Thunder rolled high overhead, the rain soaked their exposed bodies, but the beings remained still, their tattered clothes dripping. Their cracked lips moved in a jumbled mass of the same sounds, unsynchronized, but similar nonetheless. Some of the decaying stench was suppressed by the rain, but I could still taste it on the back of my tongue, the sickly-sweet aroma of their unwashed, maltreated bodies, bound together with mud and wood. The ones who weren’t close enough to run their hands over the truck’s skin stood relaxed, with more crude weapons in their hands, all fashioned from bones, sinew, and flesh. Watching from the tree line, riders atop packs of Birch Crawlers awaited some sort of signal, some sign that I couldn’t understand.

What were they waiting for?

*“Have to go.”* One of the crew from truck three murmured in the headset, his words slurred as though he were drunk. *“Need to see it.”*

A seatbelt clicked, and Jamie surged through the truck interior past me, crawling on her hands and knees. “Liam? Liam, don’t you dare get out of that truck. Stay inside, you hear me?”

I scrabbled up beside her at the rear gun slots, only to stare in horror as the back doors of truck three swung open, and the crowd of eyes surged forward.

Screams cut through the night from inside the compartment, the truck rocked, and a rifle went off.

Silence.

*“It’s so warm in the rain.”* Truck four’s commander sighed over the speakers, with a strange, lilt to his voice.

Jamie racked the bolt on her AK and stuck the muzzle out the rearward firing slit, though I doubted she had a clear shot of anything for how dark it was. “Reggie, I swear to God, if you open that door I will put a bullet in your—”

*Click.*

It came from behind me, and I turned, my mouth falling open in muted dread.

*Oh no.*

Kevin’s head swiveled around to look back at us, his eyes glazed in an empty stare as he shoved open the driver’s door.

“It only hurts for a moment.” He cooed, in a soft breathlessness that seemed rife with anticipation.

Scarcely had the words left his mouth, and a river of gray hands dragged themselves into the truck.

Everything seemed to happen at once. Zach tried to back away from the horde, but more Puppets wriggled inside, and grabbed him by the ankles. Jamie’s AK spat fire into the oncoming gray faces, its report deafening inside the armored metal box. My submachine gun floated up into my field of vision, and the ringing in my ears reached a fever pitch as bullets sang into the night.

*Clack.*

The bolt rammed home on an empty chamber, and I reached for another magazine.

“Chris!” I shrieked into my headset, fumbling to reload my weapon. “Chris, they’re coming in, we can’t—”

A grimy set of fingers wrapped around my left boot and jerked me off balance.

The Type 9 blazed a stream of rounds into the ceiling of the armored compartment, the lead whining and ricochetting off the interior like a swarm of angry bees. Hands clawed at my legs, sharp fingernails turned only by the rough weave of my khakis, and I was dragged over the cluttered floor of the truck bed.

I thrashed, kicked, and swung the barrel of my submachine gun down to catch a few in the face with the last rounds of the magazine, but it was no use. My heels went over the center console, and I just managed to stop them from pulling me out by wrapping by arms around the headrest of the driver’s seat. More hands pried at my fingers, yanked at my hair, gripped my clothing, and ensured I couldn’t break free of the sinister tide.

“Jamie!” Reaching one desperate hand from the seat, I called to her, my eyes filled with horrified tears.

Jamie crouched against the rear doors of the truck, fanning the trigger of her rifle with all she had just to keep the mutants back. As my Type 9 slid from my grasp, they piled over one another, grinning soundlessly as they slid past me to climb further inside.

My free hand brushed cold steel at my hip, and I closed my hand over the pistol Andrew had given me as a belated birthday present. A one-to-one clone of Chris’s antique Mauser handgun, this one came newly made from the armory, chambered in the same 9mm cartridge as my Type 9, but with a smaller 10-round magazine. It had more than enough power to deal with these creatures, and I pushed the muzzle point-blank into the nearest Puppet’s face.

*Bang.*

It crumpled backward, but more pressed in to claim its place, and the gun’s bolt locked to the rear after the tenth round went off.

I felt my fingers slip on the seat cushion, and my heart stopped.

*I should’ve saved that last bullet.*

“*No!*” Jamie’s sheet-white face contorted in horror, and she reached for my hand, but it was too late.

A blizzard of filthy palms overwhelmed me, and the world blurred as I was carried off into the pouring rain.

Cold raindrops soaked me to the bone, my pistol clattered to the gravel beside the truck, and with every step the freaks held me aloft like a nightmarish mosh pit. One slimy hand clamped over my mouth to stifle my screams for help, and another went over my eyes, my limbs pinned down in a similar fashion. Gunfire picked up all along the convoy, but it faded into the distance as my captors fled into the underbrush with me. Unable to free myself, I shut my eyes beneath the dirty hand that covered them and waited for teeth to sink into my skin.

*Splat.*

Cold earth rammed into my knees, and I found myself dumped onto the mud, though the fiends maintained their grip on my legs, arms, and mouth. Daring to blink through the slightly parted fingers of my captors, I could just make out a small circle of lights around me, and spotted several different flashlights stuck into the mud, with their lenses angled upward like torches. Close to a hundred or more Puppets ringed the small clearing I knelt in, their continued whispers audible in the cold breeze, though I could see little more than gleaming white eyes in the darkness. Slumped in front of them were more rangers from our patrol, their heads hanging limp, held in place by rigid teams of grinning Puppets. They seemed to be unconscious, but otherwise unharmed, and I would have been more confused if I hadn’t been so frightened.

*How are they doing this? They were mindless freaks not days ago. This shouldn’t be possible.*

All at once, the whispers stopped.

I craned my head to try and see more, but the hands forced me to look forward, the fingers over my eyes staying where they were. As one, the Puppet’s heads turned in the misty gloom, and they looked toward the forest as if in anticipation.

A shape glided through the rain, stooping low to walk under the thorns and tangled branches. It stood as tall as any other human might, but not until it stepped into the circle of flashlights did I notice the long, moldy canvas of an old military poncho draped across its shoulders. With a cavernous hood to cover its owner’s head, the poncho went all the way to the ground so that I almost didn’t see the old boots covered in rips, scratches, and holes walking along the muck. Something about this mysterious being made my guts roil, but I could do nothing but remain where I knelt, shivering in the cold rain.

Reaching the center of the small clearing, the hooded figure stopped, all eyes on it.

Two hands slid from under the poncho, one surprisingly human and pale, the other gray and torn, with two of the fingers worn down to the bone, flesh hanging in rotted tatters. They lifted up toward the sky, like some kind of priestly gesture, and from beneath the ragged hood, came a voice.

“The way lies open.” It rasped in a fluid-filled gargle that made me want to gag sympathetically, and slowly turned on the spot to address all the freaks in the circle. “The hunt has begun. Let us purge this corruption, my children, that the Nameless One might take pleasure in our conquest.”

Beaming like kids at a candy store, the Puppets all turned their gazes toward us, their bared wooden teeth dripping with rainwater and black slime. Seeing them all upright, responding to speech, with their own crude weapons in hand sent my mind into overdrive.

*I’ve got to get out of here.*

Walking over to the first captive, the hooded figure took the man’s chin in its good hand and raised his unconscious head upward.

My stomach lurched as I recognized Kevin, his buzz-cut brown hair glistening with raindrops.

“Awaken, little one.” Raising its ruined hand high, the hooded figure held something long and black in its grasp. “Our glorious era draws near.”

The dead hand plunged down, and I winced at a sickening *crunch*.

In a spasm, Kevin’s eyes flew open, and he let out a guttural cry of pain that rang into the surrounding trees. His body tensed as if to struggle, but another sound overpowered his voice, a squelching gurgle that choked out Kevin’s wail.

He froze, stiff as a statue, and Kevin’s jaw stuck open in mid-scream.

I squinted hard between the fingers over my eyes, in time to spot something black poked from between his teeth. It wriggled like a worm, even as more shapes like it spread around Kevin’s bedraggled head from the back. Oily tendrils pried their way under his eyelids, up his nostrils, and into Kevin’s ears until they completely encased his head, and I realized what they were.

*Roots. Those are roots. Like from a tree.*

With an incessant march of rot and wood, the roots burrowed under Kevin’s pale skin, dark lines appearing like spiderwebs over his neck. More wove themselves over his body from head to toe, all leading back to a long, thin blade that protruded from the back of his skull. It looked to be fashioned it seemed from a single piece of hardwood, like someone had split off a chunk of an old tree trunk and left the end sharp like a knife. Bits of human hair lay braided around the hilt, and something about the weapon made my head spin, static rising inside my brain in a dizzying avalanche of noise.

The hooded figure withdrew the odd knife from Kevin’s skull, and the roots continued to wrap around him in a wall of black. Ripping and popping sounds came from underneath, and between the snaking tendrils, I watched in shock as pools of red blood oozed out, followed by chunks of rubbery stuff that looked like flesh.

Toward the back of Kevin’s head, the sprouts began to withdraw, and from under them, black oily hair tumbled forth.

*It’s not possible.*

Helplessly I watched as the dark vines receded to show gray skin, torn clothing, and two milky white eyes sunken into the face. The last of the tendrils flowed over the Kevin’s chin, before disappearing down his now blackened throat to leave behind square, brown wooden teeth.

The new Puppet blinked, and his frozen scream stretched into a familiar, wide grin.

My breath caught in my chest, and I gritted my teeth to hold back nausea. It had been common knowledge amongst the rangers that a Puppet bite, while full of nasty bacteria, wouldn’t turn you into one like in a zombie movie. In fact, while I’d seen Puppets converted to humans, I never considered in all my worst nightmares that the opposite could take place. Yet I’d just seen it with my own eyes, and horrid despair invaded my mind.

They were going to do that to me.

Beaming in eerie joy, the new Puppet stood and bowed its head to the hooded figure.

“Finish it, my child.” With a wave of its human hand, the figure directed the Puppet’s gaze to the flashlight by its feet. “Let go of the corruption that is the old. Embrace the perpetual night.”

Without pause, the Puppet who had been Kevin obediently brough his heel down on the light from his old rifle, and the glass crunched under his boot.

At that moment, I made the mistake of inhaling through my nose, and caught a whiff of the Puppet’s grimy hand that was over my mouth. It stank of must and mold, enough that my nose flared with a strong, sudden itch.

*Don’t do it, don’t do it, don’t . . .*

Desperate to hold it in, I tried to pull my nose away from the thing’s hand but couldn’t squirm loose.

“*Achoo*.”

Every gaze shifted to me, dozens of neck vertebrae crunching in sequence, and I choked down a whimper of fear.

“What’s this?” Under its moldy hood, the figure’s head turned, the gaping maw of inky shadow examining me from a distance.

It paced closer and towered over me, a mass of black shadow. The Puppets didn’t move, but a few made muffled clacks of their peg-shaped teeth in excitement, the fingers holding my shoulders drumming on my skin in glee.

Kneeling down, the hooded figure reached out with its good hand to pull the Puppet’s grubby palm from my face. “You can resist the master’s call? I am impressed. Just who might you be?”

*I’ve gotta stall. Maybe I can get loose, maybe I can run. I just need time.*

“H-Hannah.” I stammered out, the icy rainwater dripping down my neck in rivulets enough to make my skin feel numb. “Hannah Brun.”

“What a lovely name.” The voice wheezed, too deep and rough to be female, but so garbled and strained that I wondered if it could be human at all. “And yet, so ill fitted for your kind. Creative energy was always something wasted on man. I will give you a new one, a better one, and you will sing with my sons and daughters in the sacred grove of the Nameless One. Would you like that?”

Swallowing, I fought to keep from hyperventilating, and flexed my fingers over the sections of my war belt that I could reach, in search of something to stab with. “What’s the sacred grove?”

Clammy fingers stroked my cheek in a way that made my skin crawl. “A gift, dear one. A chance to start over, to bring balance to this noxious world, and restore it to its former glory. You will see it with new eyes, and you will rejoice.”

“Who are you?” I gulped, eyeing the figure’s opposite hand, where it grasped the jagged wooden knife, Kevin’s blood speckled on the grain.

Somehow, even though I couldn’t see its face, I knew the figure was smiling for how it bowed its head in faux appreciation. “I am the usher of the great devourer, champion of the eternal road, priest of the living shadow. Once, I had another name but now . . . now I am *Vecitorak*.”

At the name, a hushed gasp of wonder came from the army of Puppets, as if just hearing it was enough to make them faint. I had to admit, it sent chills up my already cold spine, the word echoing in my ringing ears with an ancient, otherworldly vibration. In my old life I might have laughed at such a name, but here I trembled, for the title had power, and even the instinctive cells of my body knew it.

“What do you want?” I squeaked, fingers closing on nothing, my knife too far back on my war belt to grasp.

Vecitorak’s grip tightened on my chin, and I tried to pull away, but couldn’t.

Eager hands closed in from every side to hold me down, and the wooden dagger rose into the rainy sky.

“There is no need to fight it.” Vecitorak bent over me with oppressive weight, as the Puppets shoved my head forward, parting my hair to bare the back of my skull. “It only hurts for a moment.”

*God, let me die instead.*

Unable to move, I tried to scream, but only managed a strangled sob. This wasn’t death; it was worse. A remaking of me from the inside out, a violation so permanent, so cruel that I wouldn’t even be me afterward. I’d be a freak, roaming the woods and clacking my teeth on all fours. I wouldn’t know the sun, or cool summer breeze. I wouldn’t remember what it was to eat a nice dinner or feel Chris’s arms around me.

I wouldn’t *be* anymore.

Taking in the last breath I’d ever draw, I shut my watery eyes, and pictured Chris, our unborn children, and our cozy homestead in rural Pennsylvania. All a dream. One I’d never have again.

*Thunk.*

Something bounced off the mud a few feet away, and the excited murmurs of the Puppets dropped into stoney silence.

*Bang.*

My already abused eardrums trilled with protest before I even had a chance to open both eyes, and the world lit up in a bright white flash.

Rifle fire cut through the forest, and shrieks of alarm went up from all the Puppets around me.

Lukewarm spatters coated my cheek as something whizzed by, and the hands loosened their grip on my arms.

Heart leaping in my chest, I wrenched away from them, and threw myself into the mud on hands and knees as fast as I could go. Without a hand to cover my eyes, I could see two huge plumes of orange flame sweeping back and forth in the distant brush, along with bursts of yellow muzzle flashes, the trees raging with fire. Puppets charged, but were cut down, and from the gloom, a familiar silhouette emerged with his maple-syrup colored hair plastered down on his head with rain.

*Chris.*

Fresh blood ran down his face and arms, but Chris advanced into the inferno with his M4 blazing, the leftover rangers from the convoy scything through freaks like they were made of butter. Beside him, Jamie hammered away with her Kalashnikov, her light blonde hair shining like a star in the firelight. The columns of orange flame came from two rangers dressed in black protective suits and welder’s helmets, holding the nozzles of a set of homemade flamethrowers that belched liquid fire into the sodden woods like dragons. To their left, squads of workers erupted from the thorn bushes still in their denim overalls, Ethan Sanderson at their head, driving back the ranks of Birch Crawlers by tossing hand grenades in waves. On the right, underbrush crashed, and glowing green antlers bobbed into view, the thunder of hooves unmistakable as long swords flashed alongside the rifles of Ark River.

A smile crossed my face, and I pushed myself to my feet.

*Just a few more yards.*

I picked one boot off the ground to run, my eyes on Chris, and opened my mouth to call his name.

“Where are you going, Hannah?” A fist yanked my head backward by my hair, and the warbly voice chuckled in my ear.

Searing pain exploded just under my ribs, and both feet buckled under me.

With a scream I landed on my stomach, and through eyes blurred by tears, I looked up to see the hooded figure crouched over me.

Vecitorak bent low, his dead hand pressing the wooden blade deeper into my side and put all of his weight on the gnarled weapon. “You think you’ve won?”

My skin itched, and pain seethed outward from the skin near my ribs, with a crawling sensation that wasn’t from sweat or blood. I tried to squirm free, tried to fight, but he pinned my wrists with his good hand, and drove the knife in so that I screeched in agony.

“You cannot hide.” He leaned down, so close that I could smell the fetid breath, the hood too deep to catch a glimpse of the face beneath. “Your world will fall. I already own you, child.”

Whispers rose in my head, my flesh twitched from foreign prodding beneath its surface, and the world spun.

Vecitorak let go of my wrists and yanked the knife from my side with a harsh twist.

I yelped in torment, but he just pressed his one good hand to the side of my head, pushed my skull into the mud, and raised his knife for the final blow.

*Bang.*

Vecitorak howled, and through bleary eyes, I glimpsed a nearby figure emerge from a white cloud of gun smoke.

A flintlock pistol fell to the mud, and steel twinkled in the aura of the growing flames as a cutlass whirled in the air.

Metal and wood met for an instant with a dull *clang* and heavy feet thudded over the ground into the trees.

*Can’t fall asleep.*

Whispers clogged my brain, and I tried to push myself up onto all fours, one hand clapped to the dripping gouge in my torso. It hurt worse than anything I’d ever dealt with before, and the pain continued to spread under my trembling fingers, movement that wasn’t mine.

Unable to get my legs to work, I tugged aside my shirt, and stared in terrified revulsion.

Crimson streams leaked from where the knife had gone in, but under the torn flesh, black lines fanned out in a slow, but steady network of curious growth. Cruel oily tendrils sliced tunnels through my skin, wiggled with parasite joy at every groan of pain I made, and various roots spouted from the wound itself, as if tasting the outside air. My muscles ached, the skin seemed to be on fire, and nausea wracked me in a tidal wave of sickness.

Collapsing onto the ground, I vomited, and tasted metallic blood amongst the sour bile.

“Over here!” A face appeared overhead, dark hair and scruff with a bandana and old-fashioned coat.

My vision dimmed, and my throat started to close, each breath a tortuous fight.

“No, no, no!” Chris’s voice echoed, as if he were far away in a tunnel, laced with a sadness that hurt almost as bad as the roots chewing through me. “My God, Hannah, no.”

“We have to get her to O’Brian.” A bleach blonde head bolted into view, two green eyes looking down into mine. “Hannah, say with me. Stay with me, we’re going to get you fixed up, just stay with me, please.”

Darkness closed in, the whispers in my ear rising to shrill screams.

“Someone get me a truck, *now!*” Chris’s shout broke halfway through with a muffled sob, and two arms circled under my armpits.

The world tilted, hungry tongues of fire consumed the trees, and my limp heels plowed furrows into the earth as they dragged me away. All the heat seeped out of my body, my throat went dry and tight, and the static melted my thoughts.

Too weak to fight them, I let the whispers sweep over me, and everything went black.
