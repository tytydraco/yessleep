"Marleen?", I asked. 
She nodded. 
"Where have you met her?", she said. 
I didn't really know. 
"She went to our school." 
Did she though? I never really talked much with her. Maybe because she wasn't there most of the time? Where was she most of the year? I don't remember. 

"Hmm" Miranda sighed. 
"Maybe I'm just remembering it wrong. I saw that girl once, many years ago. She probably just had the same hairstyle." 
Miranda shrugged and watched the fire again. There it was again, the weird, wrong feeling I had since Marleen stormed out of the room when I asked her to join me. Why did she accuse me of singling her out? She was never there. I think she was never there.

"Let's go. We need to get as far as we can before our food goes bad again." 
Miranda took my hand and we walked towards the forest behind the restaurant. Into the unknown behind that huge darkwood building. Actually walking around it, it looked way smaller outside than from the inside. 

The tree tops above us caused a sudden drop in temperature. It felt nice, but the past months taught me to fear the cold. I couldn't help but feel in danger. The forest was so eerily silent. I'm not sure if I had ever seen an animal in this place, other than the bears of course. The image still pops up in my head every now and then. The blood and gore, the horrifically mangled body of.. was it a person? Yes, it was eating a person. I missed the sound of birds. 

We walked straight for what felt like hours. The forest seemed to go on forever. We had our first lunch break, sitting on top of some roots of an old tree. It felt nice and calming, the food was still edible. A bit stale but nutritious. 

"What will you do when we find the stairs and you're back home?", she asked in a quiet moment. I thought about it and didn't find a satisfying answer. All this time, home was just a solution for a problem, I didn't realise how far I had grown apart from my old life. I barely remembered what it was like back then. I know it was great, so much better than anything I encountered here, of course. There was so much I was looking forward to, that made it difficult to focus on just one thing. 

"I guess first I will get something to eat, no matter what." 
She giggled a little. 
"That's right, I could really use some guilt free food for once." 
She leaned against the tree and closed her eyes. I think she got lost in daydreams. I hoped so much, we would still be friends once we were back to our old lives. I hoped our old lives were still out there somewhere, waiting for us.

We continued our walk through the never ending forest. The perpetual midday sun made it hard to figure out how much time had passed. Half a day, maybe a full day, maybe we walked straight through the night. Our empty stomachs were the only kind of time measurement we had, and even that soon became untrustworthy. The further we went, the less need for food we felt. 

It felt good not to be feeling like I was starving for once, but instead there was the wrongness of it all causing a pit in my stomach. Something was enticing us to keep going. Did what it had to, to keep us on our feet. Our walk was boring and monotonous. There weren't any sounds to listen to or images to see. No birds, no crickets, no wind. Even my thoughts left me for most of the journey. The tranquility felt artificial.

But then there was something to recognise. A smell. I stopped dead in my tracks as I first noticed it. It smelled like sugar, like memories, like love. The smell of cookies. I knew those cookies. I think my mom used to bake them for new years eve. They reminded me of the cold winter air and the smell of firework rockets. It seemed so alone, outside of its usual context. 

"What is it?", Miranda asked. 
"Do you smell that?" 
She turned her head and sniffed the air. Based on her expression, she didn't seem to recognise it. I took a few steps around to determine where it could be coming from and began moving into that direction. After a while, she began to smell it as well. 

The cookie aroma led us along a strangely winding path through the dense woods until we reached its origin. In the middle of a clearing, there stood a waist high, white pedestal. On top was a plate with still steaming, freshly baked cookies. The image was unreal. We stood there for a while and inspected it. We didn't need to spell it out to know that this looked like a trap. There was just no reason those cookies would just be standing around alone in a forest. They looked so tempting though. We hadn't eaten inâ€¦ well, I had no idea how long we hadn't eaten. There wasn't a way of telling anymore. Our food had been used up a while ago and hunger started to slowly set in again. 

"Should we try one? Before they get cold?" 
Miranda held out a hand over the pile to feel the heat they were emitting. 
"I wouldn't. Something clearly wants us to." 
She picked up one of the cookies. 
"For sure. But what tells you that that something wants us harm?" 

She had such an entranced look in her eyes, the same look the people in the restaurant had. I didn't like it, but I began to feel the same. Those cookies didn't only smell like salvation to my hungry stomach, they smelled like emotions I hadn't had in a long time. 

I ate one. It tasted just like that as well. A feeling I couldn't quite explain. The emotions they gave me, weren't fitting for what they were. They reminded me more of a person than a treat. I tried to wrap my head around it, ate the others as well just to get a chance to comprehend. Miranda ate them too. The feeling got fainter with every cookie I ate. When they were gone, I was none the wiser. They meant something to me I didn't understand and since they were gone, I probably never would.

We didn't feel less or more hungry as we returned to our path. Our feet took us probably a few hours further through the forest before we decided to sleep again. We slept in this forest before, didn't we? How many times? Sleep didn't come easy in the glaring sunlight but exhaustion greatly helped. The next day, we just started walking again. The further we got, the less we talked. Silence just felt natural. My head was empty, as if our path was one long meditation. I didn't feel my legs either. They didn't need my input anymore, they knew what to do. Walking was like breathing now. Soon, the forest became one with us.

I didn't trust my eyes as we noticed something new in the distance. Reflecting. Shimmering. Water. I wasn't used to seeing anything but trees anymore. We didn't get faster, just steadily walked closer until we were forced to stop. It was a river that cut straight through our path. It wasn't very broad. Too far to jump but not too far to cross by climbing along the fallen tree we saw just a few minutes upstream. We agreed on that plan without exchanging a word. As we trotted along the shore I watched the slow flow of the muddy water along its path. Why did it look so familiar? Marleen. Why did my brain take me to her again? 

We reached the fallen tree and Miranda went first. Crouched down on all fours, she slowly crawled along the big log. I stayed close behind her. At two thirds of the way she suddenly stopped. I waited but she didn't say a word. 
"Miranda? Are you ok?" She didn't answer. 
Her eyes were fixated on the water. I sat down on the tree and tried to see what she was looking at. It wasn't easy to recognise at first. 

There was a dog. Muddy and overgrown with algae and moss. It must have been dead for a long time. It had gotten difficult to distinguish from the dark rocks and water plants. It was stuck there, floating under the surface next to the tree trunk. I could help but pity it. Its fur was green, patchy and rotting. Its body swayed in the stream like Miranda's hair in the wind. She stared at it and didn't move. I leaned in a bit closer in an attempt to see what held it in its place while trying to keep my balance on the log. 

There was a vine, wrapped around the dog's leg. I broke a branch off the tree we were sitting on and used it to poke at the plant. It was a bit uncomfortable from that distance but I managed to free the dead dog from its bounds. The corpse started to drift gently down the river. We watched it until it disappeared into the distance. Miranda stayed on the trunk a moment longer after the dog had left our view. 
"I wonder what happened to him", she said silently, in thought, before turning back towards the other shore. 

We passed the river and entered a vast and never ending field before us. There was nothing but grass visible as far as we could see. I didn't want this anymore. I just wanted to get home. I needed to find that staircase, if there even was one. No, there had to be one. The one we went through to end up here. It was somewhere out there. I knew it. But I gotta admit, I grew desperate. How long would we have to traverse the infinity until we finally reached our home again? 

I took Miranda's hand and we started walking through the field. It had even less variety than the forest. A place like this could make you go utterly insane. At our next rest stop we sat down on the soft grass. We didn't talk, we didn't eat or drink. We couldn't even if we wanted to. We just waited. My back felt so much lighter, sitting there without my backpack. I didn't even realise how much it hurt all this time until the pain was suddenly gone. We decided to leave the bags behind. We didn't use any of our items in the past few days anyways. They were just weight. Weight we couldn't need.

We kept walking and I spent hours following the clouds with my eyes. They didn't display any shapes. They were just some soft, white streaks on a light blue background, slowly drifting along from right to left, always at the same speed. Like a screensaver. Our legs carried us until they barely could anymore. 

Turns out the "we don't need food" - feeling wasn't right. It was just our minds coping with the fact that there was nothing to do about our situation. In reality, the hunger was unbearable. Just like that, our legs got used to walking even when they reached their physical boundaries as well. I was glad I hadn't had a thought in days. If I could have still considered giving up, I probably would have. I would have never found my way home. 

I had to force my legs to stop when I heard Miranda stumble behind me. She landed on her knees and let herself fall into the grass. I sat down as well, knowing that it would be an immense effort to get back up again later. She lay huddled up into a ball on her side. 

"I can't walk anymore", she croaked. 
Her voice sounded raspy from dehydration. I put one hand on her shoulder. 
"No, please. We have to find the staircase. We came so far." 

That was the first thing I said in days. I didn't realise how much talking could hurt. My throat was so sore. 
"Luke" She took a deep breath. 
"I don't think we will find the staircase anymore." "Don't say that! We have to keep trying, our lives are on the line." She curled up a little more. 
"I'm sorry, Luke. You already lost so much." 

I tried to get back on my feet. 
"I wouldn't mind losing the rest if it means I could bring us home." 
Thinking about the things that would await me gave me strength. It did all this journey and so much more now, that hope was the only thing I had left. A cool wind blew through our hair. It helped me focus. The cold didn't scare me anymore. It only made me think clearly again. I took all my strength together to help Miranda stand up again. She was all I had and I had to bring her home. I put her arm around my shoulder and helped her walk. 

Our goal was all I could think about. The only thing that was left. We walked. No matter how much it hurt, we walked. We walked until we reached it. At the end of the field, at the end of it all, there was a staircase. 

My eyes could barely focus on details. It was there, in the grass, waiting for us. Like we were always meant to find it here. Our exit wasn't a place, it was our limit. And we made it past that limit. I think Miranda didn't register it until we reached the first concrete step. I must have dragged her for a while now without noticing. Her feet hardly moved. It wasn't easy, but we made it to the other side eventually. If I had had any water left in my body, I probably would have cried. It was so beautiful. You never know what you have until you lose it. I never thought I would be crying over the view of my old hometown. I did it, Miranda. I brought us home. 

It didn't take long for someone to find us at the end of that staircase. We must have blacked out. People we didn't know, carried us away. They gave us water and food, they told us how brave and strong we were, that all will be good in the end. It already was good. 

I woke up in a comfortable, white bed. Miranda lay in a bed not far from me. I missed sleeping in a real bed. The flowers and snacks our friends brought us were propped up on a table between us. I couldn't help but spend every waking moment smiling. 

There was a knock on the door. It was Marleen. She had visited us a few times already since we arrived back at home. She always brought the most delicious things from the courtyard. We were so lucky to have her. This time, she held a bowl of different fruits. 

"Hey you two, how are you doing today? The store was just restocked today." 
Miranda had just woken up from the sound, turned and fell asleep again. I smiled at Marleen. 
"Pretty good, thank you so much for all this." 
"Don't mention it, Luke. Everyone in town is so glad you're back. Have I told you how relieved I was to see you?" 
"Only like twenty times already." 
We chuckled. 
She sat down on the edge of my bed and handed me the bowl. 
"I always knew you had it in you, you know? From the day I met you at the lake, I knew you were the one who would make it." 
I turned my head a little and grinned. 
"I don't know what you're talking about, but thank you, I guess." 
She smiled back at me and slightly punched my shoulder in a playful way. 
"Doesn't matter. You don't have to think about that place anymore. Your home now, Luke"
