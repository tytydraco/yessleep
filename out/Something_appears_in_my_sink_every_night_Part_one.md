 Anabel came home from work tired. She dropped her bag, turned the lights on and sighed, realising that the food smell is still on her. You never know how really gross everything about the food is, until you go through your personal working-in-a-restaraunt-to-get-through-college phase. It's almost like people forget about being conscious beings when they sit down to eat, maybe the knowledge they won't have to clean after themselves is what turns them into literal monsters. 
 
 Anabel went into the kitchen, being totally sure she won't be able to eat, but still hoping for a miracle, because "c'mon, Anabel, eating is something that you kinda need to survive, you know." She turned the kitchen light on and made herself go to the fridge, catching a glimpse of something pink and slimy in the kitchen sink. "Weird, thought Anabel, did I put the turkey in the sink?". She opened the fridge, stared at the insides for a moment, untill it finally dawned on her. "Oh my God!" Anabel went back to the sink. "Oh sure, great," she thought, because of course she could only leave turkey here before leaving in the morning, which meant it already might smell bad. 

Anabel bowed to turkey, smelling it. Oh, no. She pulled her face away quickly. This just might be the worst smell that ever entered her lungs. Weirdly enough, it was only felt when being really close to the meat. And somehow turkey was still really cold, even after whole day, like someone's dead body. "Wait, but it *is* a someone's dead body..? I think I need some sleep." 

She knew when coming home, she most likely won't be able to eat, but after inhaling that... Anabel only wanted a glass of water and to get to bed, she wasn't even going to fix that mess in a sink. She poured herself a cup and stood in front of the window, drinking. A small bit of silence in her busy life. She put the cup on the table near the window and went towards the exit. She stopped. She looked at the sink. She stepped closer to the sink and carefully, really carefully looked inside. It was exactly this moment when she remembered she saw the turkey while staring in the fridge, perfectly unpacked and untouched. 

Two big human eyes stared back at her from the sink, one green and the other one's blue. While Anabel was in shock, there slowly appeared a hole in the meat and out of there grew the third eye, milky blind. Anabel stepped back from the sink. Then she came back closer. 

 The meat was breathing. There were no visible parts of anatomy that could be responsible for breathing, but the whole pink goo was moving like a chest of a sleeping person. Rising from deep inhale, slowly going down on exhale. On the exhale a foul smell started to rapidly get stronger and Anabel was so shocked that she didn't even cover her nose. 

 Suddenly, God only knows why, Anabel decided to touch it. She could swore something was wrong with her in the brain, but she put her hand on the surface. Then she tried to rip it apart with her fingers to get to the bottom, with no honest idea why on earth she was doing that. Meat was easy to get through and Anabel touched something solid just under the surface. She puled it out. Something white, big and heavy came slowly with Anabel's arm. She pulled and pulled. Teeth? Nostrils? Eye sockets. A horse skull was in Anabel's hands. She dropped it on the floor, feeling nothing inside and feeling alien because of that nothingness. The sink made a weird sound that it did when something was stuck in it and didn't let the water in. Anabel looked at it. The pink mess started growing bigger, forming some bobbles and vague forms on itself. Out of the new hole appeared three long spider legs. They scratched around, neither able to find solid surface, nor able to get the whole body out of that hole completely. There appeared three more legs, then even more and each leg was in size like Anabel's arm. 
 
 Anabel found the courage to slowly take the knife she left on the table when leaving. She took a few seconds and finally started violently stabbing at... Everything, at all that was in the sink. Dead unblinking eyes started crying with rotten blood and the smell got so bad, Anabel felt some part of her soul going insane. 

 Unsurprisingly, there was a lot of blood on the whole kitchen and mess in the sink got even messier, but now it didn't appear to breath at least. There was the whole world of bones, teeth, hair, rotten human and animal parts that the knife uncovered underneath pink slime. Anything resembling a spider was nowhere to be seen.

 Anabel dropped the knife and wobbled out of the kitchen, away from the smell. She thought of going to shower and obsessively scratching everything off her skin for an hour, but got terrified of the idea of seeing her naked body right now in the mirror. She went into her room and locked it and barricaded it with a chair. She sat on the floor and was in shock for some time. She knew she wouldn't sleep that night. 

 Suddenly she felt the need to look at her arm, the one that touched the pink. Two more fingers grew on it.
