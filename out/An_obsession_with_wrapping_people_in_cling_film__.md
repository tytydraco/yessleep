In a small, forgotten corner of the city, there lived a man whose eccentricity was matched only by his peculiar appearance. His name was Professor Clingwell, though no one could quite remember how he’d earned that title. His face was odd—his mouth was impossibly small, like a tiny slit barely visible on his otherwise round face. But what caught most people’s attention were his glasses. They weren’t just any glasses. They were enormous, bulbous, magnifying goggles that made his eyes appear to bulge like two glass marbles.



Professor Clingwell had a reputation, but it wasn’t the sort of reputation you’d want. He was known for his bizarre inventions, the most notorious of which was a cling film wrapping machine, which he proudly claimed could “wrap anything—or anyone—in layers of protection,” and was exactly as unsettling as it sounded.


The morning air hung thick with a sense of impending dread as Professor Chigwell’s latest twisted experiment began to take shape. The  inventor, now consumed by his dark obsessions, had concocted a plan unlike anything before. It was far more bizarre, grotesque, and cruel than his usual bizarre creations. But in his warped mind, it was all in the name of “science”—a desperate, chaotic attempt to test the limits of the human condition.



Chigwell had stumbled upon a homeless man in the city, someone living on the fringes of society, his face weathered by years of hardship. The professor, with his unnervingly magnified eyes, had watched the man for days. To Chigwell, this man was the perfect “subject”—someone society had abandoned, someone without power, someone whose life was expendable for the greater cause of his research.



The man, unaware of the danger closing in on him, wandered the streets aimlessly, searching for scraps, lost in his own world. Chigwell approached him with the calm demeanor of a person who had done this before. His voice, smooth and unsettling, coaxed the man into his van under the guise of a “scientific opportunity.”



“You’ll be helping me with something truly extraordinary,” Chigwell had said, his small mouth curling into a tight, eager grin. “An experiment. You’ll be safe. Just trust me.”



Once inside, the man had been bound, disoriented and confused, before he even had a chance to resist. The next moments were a blur of cold, harsh plastic as the professor wrapped him from head to toe in layers of cling film. The tight plastic made the homeless man gasp for breath, his movements restricted, but he was too dazed to fully comprehend what was happening.



Professor Chigwell had no patience for protests. The man’s body was wrapped tightly, layer after layer, until he resembled a human mummy, unable to move, unable to speak, his face covered in a suffocating film of plastic that pulled at his skin with each shallow breath.



With eerie precision, Chigwell’s mechanical crane, the same one he’d used for other grotesque experiments, was brought into play. The man, now helpless and confused, was hoisted upside down by thick ropes, his body dangling precariously in the air as the professor smiled up at him, his goggled eyes gleaming with mad excitement. The helpless victim was left to dangle, bound and helpless, as the machine hummed around him.



Then came the final horror: a large vat, steaming with an unholy, vile scent, sat beneath the crane. The tub was filled with thick, viscous excrement—excrement of a kind no human should ever come into contact with. The foul stench made the air choke, but the professor didn’t seem to notice. For him, this was all part of his cruel experiment, a test to push the limits of what the human body could endure.



The man, still wrapped tightly in cling film, was slowly lowered, head-first, toward the steaming pit of filth. As he neared the foul liquid, the stench hit his senses like a physical blow. His gag reflexes kicked in, but his body was immobile—completely bound and helpless. His thoughts were a blur of panic, disgust, and despair as the hot excrement bubbled beneath him, threatening to engulf him entirely. He tried to scream, but the film over his mouth muffled the sound, his voice only a muffled whimper lost in the noise of the machine.



The professor watched, his heart pounding with a twisted sense of satisfaction. “You’ll learn something important today,” Chigwell muttered to himself, as if the man were an object to be observed rather than a person. “The limits of the human will. The endurance of the body… and mind. A true experiment in survival.”



As the man was lowered further, the hot, repulsive excrement splashed against the layers of cling film, the heat pressing against his body. Though the film protected him from direct contact, the oppressive heat and the rancid stench began to overwhelm his senses. His head, nearing the surface, was bombarded with a wave of noxious fumes. He gasped, his head swimming with nausea, his entire body shaking in terror as the viscous liquid sloshed around him, its heat pressing through the film in a suffocating grip.



Chigwell continued to speak, though his voice was distant and clinical. “This is what humanity fears. This is what we do when we strip away the comforts, the safety of the world we live in. What is the mind capable of when the body is pushed beyond its limits?”



But the homeless man, in his mind, had already crossed a different threshold—a threshold beyond fear. His senses dulled, his body suffocated in the layers of cling film. His mind, wracked with the horror of the situation, went blank. He couldn’t fight back, couldn’t move, couldn’t even scream. He simply hung there, suspended in this bizarre and torturous moment, his body and mind both trapped in a world of suffocating plastic and filth.



Professor Chigwell, oblivious to the humanity of his subject, was consumed by his experiments. He reveled in the power he had over the man, in the sickening knowledge that this could only be one more step in his mad journey of discovery. But what he didn’t realize, what he couldn’t have known, was that he had crossed a line—a line between science and madness, between control and monstrosity.



For the man, however, the world had already become something else entirely—something beyond understanding. A nightmare where time ceased to exist, where he was reduced to a mere object, a specimen. His thoughts became muddled, and all he could feel was the heat, the suffocating tightness, and the desperate desire to escape—but knowing, deep down, that there was no escape. Only the slow descent into oblivion.



The scene in Professor Chigwell’s laboratory was one of utter madness, a grotesque tableau that seemed to exist outside the boundaries of human decency. The homeless man, suspended in mid-air, his body cocooned tightly in cling film, hung over the foul, steaming vat of excrement. His muffled screams echoed faintly through the thin plastic, each noise an impotent cry for help, swallowed by the thick, suffocating atmosphere of the basement.



Professor Chigwell, oblivious to the humanity of the man he had trapped, stood nearby, watching with a sick sense of satisfaction. His goggle-like glasses magnified the gleam in his eyes, a gleam that danced with a deranged excitement. He observed his “experiment” with a detached, almost scientific focus. The man’s body quivered beneath the layers of cling film as the hot excrement bubbled beneath him, the stench heavy and vile, but Chigwell felt no revulsion. To him, it was merely data—information he could study, analyze, dissect. The man, the situation, the suffering—none of it meant anything but raw material for his insatiable thirst for control.



He stood for a moment, relishing the sounds of the homeless man’s muffled pleas, before turning to a nearby shelf. His gaze fell on an old, creaky ladder propped up against the wall. It was an absurdly mundane object, but in this hellish setting, it seemed somehow more out of place than ever. A thought crossed his mind, and with an almost childlike excitement, Chigwell climbed the ladder toward the edge of the steaming pit.



The homeless man, suspended above the filth, was too weak to struggle now. His muffled screams were little more than pathetic whimpers, his body locked in an unyielding embrace of plastic that left him both powerless and suffocated. Every breath he took seemed to bring more nausea, more suffocation, as the heat of the excrement rose around him. His skin, though protected by the cling film, still felt the oppressive weight of the heat and the sickening smell. Every movement was agony, every moment of suspended torment a reminder of the professor’s cruelty.



Meanwhile, Chigwell, now perched at the top of the ladder, looked down at the pit with a twisted smirk spreading across his face. He had already done his “work”—the experiment was set, the subject was in place. But for him, it wasn’t enough. The world of science, of his own warped experiments, had become a perverse playground where any boundary, no matter how vile, was fair game for exploration.



Without a hint of hesitation, Chigwell unzipped his trousers, pulled himself free, and casually peed into the steaming pit below. The sound of his urine splashing against the surface of the excrement was the only noise that cut through the homeless man’s muffled screams. The warmth of the urine mixed with the heat of the pit, creating a nauseating stench that seemed to permeate every corner of the basement.



The professor didn’t even flinch. He continued to urinate with deliberate, clinical detachment, as if performing some strange, ritualistic act of dominance. The man hanging below, his body bound in plastic, his limbs trembling from fear and exhaustion, could do nothing but hang there, the excrement slowly rising to meet him. His muffled cries were like distant echoes, swallowed by the thick stench and the oppressive weight of the experiment.



For Chigwell, this act of degradation was a perverse statement of power. To him, the homeless man wasn’t a human being anymore—he was nothing more than a subject, an object to be manipulated, to be controlled. The professor’s mind, twisted by years of obsession and delusion, found satisfaction in the man’s suffering. His pee was just another way to assert control over a life that had already been reduced to something insignificant, something beneath him.



As the last drops of his urine fell into the pit, Chigwell stood there for a moment, admiring the scene, his breath steady and unbothered by the stench. He could hear the man’s faint whimpers, could feel the raw, animalistic energy of the situation, and yet, he remained unmoved—his mind already racing ahead to his next experiment, his next “subject.” He was a man consumed, obsessed with the limits of pain, of survival, of control. There was no humanity left in him, only the cold, calculating nature of his twisted desires.



And so, the homeless man remained suspended, his muffled cries continuing as Chigwell stood at the top of the ladder, peering down at his creation. The excrement bubbled beneath him, and the professor’s heart raced with a maddening glee.



The scene in Professor Chigwell’s basement had taken on an almost surreal, nightmarish quality—something that teetered dangerously between science and sheer madness. The homeless man, still suspended by ropes and wrapped in layers of cling film, his limbs frozen in place, could only hear the sickening sloshing of the excrement beneath him. His muffled screams, weak and trembling, were now faint whispers, swallowed by the thick, oppressive air.



But for Chigwell, the man’s suffering was nothing more than a spectacle—a grotesque performance to be manipulated at his whim. He stood at the bottom of the ladder for a moment, hands trembling with excitement as he looked down at his “subject.” A strange thrill surged through his veins—his mind was high on the chaos, the terror, the absolute control he had over this life, this existence. The man, reduced to little more than an object, was still hanging in the air like a grotesque ornament.



Chigwell’s goggled eyes sparkled with madness. But it wasn’t enough, he thought. The cling film, the excrement, the helplessness—it all felt too static, too predictable. The victim’s suffering had become a routine, and the professor hated routine. He craved unpredictability. He craved something that would push his experiment into the realm of true chaos, something that would make the man’s torment into a game.



His eyes scanned the room, darting across the disarray of his laboratory, until they landed on a long, heavy metal bar—one of the many tools he’d accumulated for his “research.” A tool that now beckoned him with an almost sickening allure.



With a sudden, jarring movement, Chigwell grabbed the bar, his hands wrapping around the cool, solid metal. The weight of it felt comforting in his grasp. He lifted it, testing its heft for a moment, his breathing growing quicker, more erratic. This was it. The moment he had been waiting for—the moment where the line between man and monster would be obliterated.



With an eerie grin spreading across his face, he stepped closer to the helpless, bound man. The homeless man, suspended upside down, could barely focus. His entire body had gone numb, his mind a haze of panic and pain. The heat from the excrement was unbearable, the pressure of the cling film suffocating him, and the noise of his own heartbeat in his ears deafening.



Chigwell raised the metal bar high above his head, his magnified eyes watching the helpless figure dangle below. For a brief moment, the professor paused, savoring the sensation of absolute power. This was what he had been craving. Not just to control, but to dominate. To assert his complete will over another human being, to reduce them to a mere plaything for his amusement.



With a savage swing, the metal bar came down with a sickening crack against the homeless man’s body. The plastic cocoon trembled with the force of the blow, a sharp, resounding impact that sent a jolt through the victim’s helpless frame. The man’s body jerked within the plastic, but there was no escape, no reprieve. His muffled scream was barely audible, drowned beneath the pressure of the film and the oppressive weight of his imprisonment.



Chigwell smiled wider, his breath heavy, as he raised the bar again. This time, he struck harder, aiming for the man’s torso. The bar collided with the cling film, making a wet, hollow sound as it hit the victim’s chest. The homeless man’s body convulsed, his head spinning with dizziness, but it was futile. Every part of him screamed, every fiber of his being begged for mercy, but the professor didn’t care. He wasn’t interested in mercy. He was interested in breaking this person. Destroying the very essence of what made him human.



With each strike, Chigwell’s excitement grew. The sickening rhythm of the metal hitting the plastic was a perverse form of music to his ears. The homeless man’s whimpers grew weaker with each blow, his body no longer reacting with the same desperation. The film had already begun to stretch and tear in places, but still, it held the man in place, trapping him in this endless cycle of agony.



The professor didn’t stop. He swung the bar again and again, as if the very act of beating this man—this discarded, forsaken soul—gave him the control he had craved for so long. His mind was far away from the reality of what he was doing. In his eyes, the man was just another specimen, another data point in his twisted experiments, another test to see how much a human could endure.



And yet, beneath the layers of cling film, beneath the physical trauma, there was something else happening. The homeless man’s mind had reached its breaking point. His thoughts were no longer coherent. The pain, the humiliation, the suffocation—it had all blurred together into one long, agonizing moment that felt like it would never end. He couldn’t feel his limbs, couldn’t scream anymore. His entire existence had been reduced to nothing more than a body to be beaten, a vessel for the professor’s sickening need for power.



Chigwell paused for a moment, panting, the sweat dripping from his brow. He surveyed his “work,” admiring the way the cling film had torn in places, the way the man’s body was shaking beneath the layers of plastic. It was as if he had achieved some perverse form of perfection. But there was still something missing. Something incomplete.



He took a step back, his breathing heavy, and for the first time, a flicker of doubt passed through his mind. Had he pushed too far? Had he gone beyond what was necessary for his “experiment”? But before that thought could fully form, the homeless man, still suspended, his body barely responsive, let out one final, broken cry—a faint sound, so distant and weak, it seemed like it came from another world.



And in that moment, Chigwell smiled once more, his goggled eyes gleaming with an almost childlike glee.



He had created something no one would ever forget—a man trapped in the depths of pain, his humanity stripped away, his suffering reduced to a grotesque experiment.



And Professor Chigwell, in his madness, had found something far more terrifying than his victims—he had found the complete absence of empathy, the total loss of humanity in his soul.
