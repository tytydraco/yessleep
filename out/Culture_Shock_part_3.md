I found the first body on my way back from the market. Dawn was breaking, painting the sky in shades of guilt, when I spotted the familiar backpack half-hidden in the drainage ditch. The tourist had been young – maybe twenty, Korean from his passport. His chest was torn open, organs missing, not from feeding but from sport. This wasn't survival; it was cruelty.

"Some of us play with our food," Susannah had warned me once, her voice casual, as if discussing a minor character flaw. Now I understood what she meant. The realization sat like poison in my gut: we weren't noble predators maintaining nature's balance. Some of us were simply monsters.

I was still staring at the body when a voice behind me said, "They're getting careless. Or maybe they want to be caught."

I spun around. A girl stood there – maybe sixteen, with eyes too old for her face. She wore a red scarf around her neck and carried a basket of herbs that made my transformed senses recoil.

"You're her granddaughter," I said, recognizing something in those knowing eyes. "The albularyo's."

She nodded. "I'm Maria. And you're running out of time."

"I don't know what you're talking about." But even as I said it, I felt the changes becoming more permanent. My teeth were always sharp now, my eyes permanently tinted amber. Sometimes I caught myself scanning crowds not as faces but as meat.

"Three more days until the next full moon," Maria said. "After that, no herb or prayer will bring you back. You'll be like them." She gestured at the corpse. "Like this poor bastard."

"Susannah isn't like this. She doesn't kill for pleasure."

Maria's laugh was bitter. "No? Watch her near pregnant women. Watch her eyes. The aswang have particular... appetites."

Something in her tone made my skin crawl. Later that afternoon, I found myself at an internet café, far from the family's watchful eyes. My hands trembled as I typed "aswang pregnant women" into the search bar.

The results made me sick.

Page after page described their preferred prey: expectant mothers, unborn children. The aswang would listen for homes with pregnant women, perch on their roofs at night, their long tongues extending down through the thatch to feed on the fetus while the mother slept. Some accounts described them keeping their victims alive for days, returning each night to feed slowly on both mother and child.

I slammed the laptop shut, but not before seeing an artist's rendering of an aswang feast – the creature's face so similar to what I saw in the mirror now. My phone buzzed: a text from Susannah. "Where are you, love? Mother's preparing something special for dinner."

On my way home, I picked her up from her friend's house and we passed a young woman walking with her husband. She was visibly pregnant, one hand resting protectively on her swollen belly. I heard Susannah's breath catch. Felt her whole body tense beside me. Her tongue – longer now than any human's should be – slid unconsciously across her lips.

"Beautiful, isn't she?" Susannah whispered, her voice thick with hunger. "So... ripe."

I watched in horror as her eyes followed the couple, saw the way she inhaled deeply, tasting their scent on the air. Her fingers twitched, nails momentarily extending into claws before she caught herself.

"We should go," I said quickly. "Your mother's waiting."

"Of course." But her eyes lingered, and I saw something ancient and terrible in them. "Did you know," she added conversationally, "that unborn children have the sweetest meat? The most tender. And their life force... it sustains us for weeks."

My stomach lurched. "Susannah..."

"Don't worry, love." She squeezed my hand, her skin fever-hot. "Soon you'll understand. Soon you'll share our tastes."

That night, unable to sleep, I heard them talking in the cellar. Crept down to listen at the door.

"He's not progressing fast enough," Elena was saying. "His conscience is still too strong."

"Give him time," Susannah argued. "He's almost there. I see how he looks at them now, how he hungers."

"We need him ready before the birthing season." A new voice – the grandmother. "The villages will be full soon. So many new mothers..."

"Perhaps he needs motivation." Elena's voice turned thoughtful. "That girl in the village – the one carrying twins..."

"No!" Susannah's voice was sharp. "I'll handle his training."

"You're too soft with him, daughter. Like you were with the others. Remember how that ended?"

I backed away from the door, but not before hearing Susannah's reply: "The others were weak. James is different. When he turns fully, he'll be magnificent. And if not..." Her voice turned cold. "Well, there are always more men. And I am very, very hungry."

The black dog was waiting for me in the garden. Larger than any I've ever seen, its red eyes blazing with ancient knowledge. As I found myself staring into his eyes, I froze where I stood. It showed me visions, like a photo slide: Susannah through the centuries, with other men. Saw how each story ended – not in partnership, but in consumption. Those she couldn't convert, she devoured. Their bodies fed her power; their souls fed her immortality.

The beast's growl formed words in my mind: "She is not what you think."

"What is she?"

"Older than this land. Darker than your nightmares. She wears beauty like a mask, but beneath..." Images flooded my mind: Susannah's true form, something that made my partially transformed body seem human by comparison. "She hunts the pure. Corrupts the good. And when she tires of playing..."

The vision shifted to a pit filled with bones. Men's bones. Some centuries old, some fresh enough to smell.

Maria's voice came back to me: "Ask yourself why there are no other men in their family."

That night, I watched Susannah prepare for the hunt. Watched her choose her outfit with care – a white dress that made her look almost innocent. Saw her check her reflection, practicing her human smile until it was perfect.

"Ready, love?" she called to me. "Mother says there's a woman in the baybay village... expecting triplets." Her voice caressed the words like a lover. "So much life. So much power. And I want you there for your first real feast."

I thought of the couple we'd seen. Thought of the black dog's visions, of Maria's warnings. Thought of the bones in that pit, of all the men who'd stood where I stood, thinking they could change her, thinking their love was different.

The herbs in my pocket felt like they were burning. Three days until the full moon. Three days to decide: become the monster they wanted, or fight to keep whatever humanity I had left.

But watching Susannah lick her lips at the thought of unborn children, seeing the ancient hunger in her too-perfect face, I wondered if I'd survive long enough to make that choice.

Above us, the waning moon hung like a countdown clock. Somewhere in the village, Maria and her grandmother prepared their rituals of protection and purification. In the cemetery, a massive black dog waited to see which path I would choose. And in the cellar below, I knew, there was a pit of bones – all that remained of men who'd once stood where I stood, loved who I loved, and discovered too late what lurked behind her smile.

The herbs felt heavy in my pocket as I followed Susannah into the night. Tonight, she promised, they would teach me new ways to feed. New ways to play with my food.

Tonight, I would learn what kind of monster I was becoming.

Or perhaps, if I was strong enough, what kind of monster I refused to be.

But as Susannah turned to me, her tongue already lengthening in anticipation, her eyes bright with inhuman hunger, I realized the true horror wasn't what she was.

It was what I was becoming.

And what I might have to do to stop it.
