Four years ago my mother killed herself for reasons unknown to me or my family, her death devastated all of us, only recently I finally came to terms with the situation, but as of last weekend she came back, she still haunts me and she is only getting closer, now I have come to believe this is not my mother. Saturday last weekend began like every other, I awoke in my bed around 9AM and quickly threw on clothes realizing I was running very late to work, not to long ago I scored a job at this family owned pizza place downtown the job was solid and the hours were good but with the current situation I do not think I'll be able to return to work anytime soon.

I worked my hours per usual and got off around 10PM, eagerly I returned home ready to relax after a long day, I don't do much in my free time and understand i'm a loser but I happily live with this fact, I don't have many friends so socializing is rather hard and to escape this fact I turn to social media. I spend hours on apps like snapchat, instagram, and tinder flirting with random women all over the world getting nudes from topless sluts was my pass time. But this time it was different I got a new add from and account on snapchat called  
"Yurluvur4evr"

I didn't think much of it if anything I was excited, this add just seemed like another mindless body I could use with no attachment, but immediately after adding them back I received a picture, eagerly I opened ready to be greeted by a nice pair of double D's but this time it was different. The picture was dully lit and I had to squint to see but in the center of the frame was a woman standing in a bathtub, her face wore a disturbed frown and tears were visable on her cheeks, immediatlely I recognized who this was, staring back at me was the face of my own mother, the same one who had passed years prior.

I opened the chat in a heartbeat and started spamming the user with messages, saying things like "what the fuck", "who is this", "How'd you get that picture". My chats were only responded to with one simple sentence  
"Im so alone here"  
I shot back more messages, threatening the user with bodily harm if they didn't stop fucking with me, I waited for what seemed like hours for them to open the chat but never received a message back. The whole situation shook me to the core, soon after I deleted the app and hoped to put the situation behind me, but just two days after while sitting in my living room watching 1000 ways to die I was called from a number I thought I would never see again, my own mothers phone was calling me from beyond the grave, instead of answering I just let it ring out to afraid I would hear her voice on the other end. Eventually curiosity got the best of me and I picked up my phone moving to my call logs ready to return her call, but just as I did that no sooner did I receive another picture quickly I opened the message only to be met with another dimly lit pic, I turned up my brightness and squinted my eyes quickly growing in horror, it was my mother in a bathroom, but not the same as last time, the closer I looked the more I could see her surroundings.

The photo had been sent from MY own bathroom just a few feet behind me down the hall, my mothers wrist had been slashed open as she held a bloodied knife in her right hand, it seemed like an entirely separate entity had taken the photo. I tossed my phone across the room a feeling of dread flowing through my body, from across the room it rapidly buzzed endlessly as message after message blew up my phone, it took me nearly an hour to gain the courage to finally get up and check it, I was sent 100+ new messages from her and received more than 50 missed calls all from her, all of the messages only repeating the same phrase  
"IM SO ALONE HERE"  
With fear in my heart I creeped down the hall towards the closed bathroom door where the photo was taken, wanting to save myself a fright I slammed my shoulder into it wanting to confront whatever was behind there as soon as possible but upon opening it there was nothing but the empty space, only a sealed letter tapped to the mirror the words  
"Open me"  
scratched into the front, having enough of this shit I ripped the letter off the wall tearing it open only for multiple photos to fall out onto the floor, as I inspected closer they were photos of me doing everyday activites, in the shower, eating food, sleeping.

I have contacted the police and am now staying in a hotel in the town over, she has not contacted me since but I know it is not the end, why wont she leave me alone?
