Hi, could someone please ID this children’s book for me?

We picked it up from the school library last week because my daughter has the same name as the main character, and she is now absolutely terrified. I don’t think the content is suitable for children. I’m trying to find out some more information about it, it’s called ‘Funny Bones’ by Benjamin Best. I would appreciate any help with this, I have transcribed the book below in case it jogs anyone’s memory.

*‘Funny Bones’*

*Written and Illustrated by Benjamin Best*

*Amy Actwell was a very silly little girl. Blowing raspberries, doing handstands, she drove her teachers crazy! The teacher would ask a question, and she’d respond with animal noises. Today, she got on the table and flapped her arms like an Ostrich!*

*Her teachers were annoyed, but her friends loved it! They laughed and laughed. They felt dizzy and their sides hurt. Amy loved the attention; she laughed along. Each day she dreamt up funny new things to do in class to make her friends laugh again and again.*

*One morning, Amy woke up to something very strange. She heard chuckling from inside her. Amy threw off her bedsheets and pressed her ear to her leg. She could hear laughing. In not just her leg, but arms, face, neck, and chest. All of her bones were laughing!*

*Amy’s bones were the best audience. Every trick, every handstand, every noise, they erupted in hysterics! They laughed louder than her friends and gave her confidence she was the funniest girl in school. But they didn’t just laugh at jokes. They laughed when she spoke, smiled, or simply answered a math question correctly. Amy didn’t like this at all. She wasn’t trying to be funny! But her bones didn’t care; they kept laughing and laughing.*

*In the afternoon, Amy was playing on the monkey bars when she fell and broke her leg. Her eyes streamed like waterfalls, and her face turned strawberry red. The pain made Amy cry so hard she could barely breathe. The bones found this hilarious. They laughed harder than ever! The louder Amy cried, the louder the bones whooped and hollered.*

*Suddenly, Amy felt her left arm snap. Once again, the bones were sent into a frenzy. Then it snapped in another place, above her elbow, then her back, then her rib. The bones found breaking so funny that they all did it! One by one, each bone broke in two, three, four pieces. They screamed with laughter as they all joined in the snapping. Even her teeth shivered with excitement. But Amy did not find this funny. Not. One. Bit.*

*The next day, Amy's bones stopped laughing. They tired of the jokes and fun. They simply decided to leave. Amy awoke to find she couldn’t move. Her muscles stretched and fingers twitched, but nothing worked. All her bones had gone! She looked like a deflated bag, and started leaking like one too. Amy soaked in a pool of her own piss and faeces. She couldn’t see past the blood coating her eyes. Her face lost its shape, and she gargled spit on the pillow. “My bones!" she mumbled. "How I wish they would come back!”*

*Amy wondered how she could have stopped them, how to be funnier for the bones. At that moment, Amy finally understood. She finally got the joke. And Amy laughed.*

*The End.*

I am unsure as how to upload images here, but the pictures in the latter half of the book are utterly grotesque. My daughter is only six years old and to have something like this work itself into her bookshelf is horrifying. She has been sleeping in bed with me and my wife for the past week. She is unable to be left on her own for more than a few minutes at a time as she is scared that she can hear her bones ‘whispering’ to her. We had a meeting with her teachers last night as they are worried that she has become withdrawn in school and advised that we go see a children’s therapist.

There are no traces of this book online, despite the copyright stating that this book has been in print for nearly 30 years. There is no ‘Artisan Publishing’ based in Grimsby, from what I can gather.

If anyone is able to provide any information about this book, please let me know. I would hate to think of any other parents being in the same situation as us. Thank you.
