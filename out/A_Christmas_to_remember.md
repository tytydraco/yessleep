 This Christmas was no different from any other Christmas me and my husband bought so many big gifts for our son after all he was 6.  

We made Christmas as magic as possible for him.

 Last night we laid out the cookies and the milk for Santa and my husband and I read him the polar express. After awhile he fell asleep that gave me and my husband time to eat half of the cookies and leave bite marks on the cookies to make it more special. Me and my husband went to sleep excited for the following day. 


 3:00 AM- I woke up and heard footsteps in our living room I got up swiftly and poked my head out the door to my surprise it was nothing. We had an old house so I excused it as that and went back to bed 


8:00 AM- I am woken up by Tommy our child bouncing on our bed we went down the hall into the living room where our tree was. Tommy began opening presents but I stopped him I stood there as my heart dropped I see 3 gifts with strange wrapping paper that we have never purchased them. My husband comes into the room and I show him there is one for each of us. I read out loud "To Tommy Love the bunny man. 

My hands were shaking as I opened the gift it was coal coal coal in every single one I was confused who would do this and what for I saw a letter on the tree in that se paper no envelope just that silly wrapping paper it said to Tommy. I opened it and what was inside shocked me to my core it said

 "Tommy I have been watching you for 37 days you are not a good kid you are the furthest from it to make your parents proud take the knife I left under ypur bed from last te and do it stab yourself Tommy your parents don't love you do it."  I started sobbing who would do this. My husband gestures to Tommy and said "go ahead bud open your gifts" as he opened the fist gift I noticed it wasn't wrapped neatly like I had done it looked re wrapped the next thing I hear is a blood curdling scream as a head fell out of the gift. I call the police but all of the power lines are out

 "fuck we are on our own" my husband said as we all tore open the gifts it was a full body each box containing a limb instead of the gifts we bought the body was not that unfamiliar it was my husband's dad my husband broke down and started incoherently murmuring. All I could make out was "kill them all" over and over again I grabbed Tommy and the car keys my husband still on the floor I turn to go out the front door and there he is the bunny man he was dressed in a bunny suit covered in blood. He was at our front door

 I screamed "why us you are sick" all of a sudden my words fell out of my mout as I felt my husband's hands on my shoulders but these weren't my husband's they were long and grey I turn around and my husband has an erie grin on his face "don't worry darling you'll be one of us soon" he says grabbing Tommy I screamed as loud as I could "don't take Tommy take me let Tommy go" and before I knew it Tommy ran into his room and grabbed the knife I stood there motionless if I tried to move I was scared I was going to end up like my husband. 

Tommy grabbed the knife and handed it to the bunny man, the bunny man picked up the knife and started stabbing Tommy over and over and over again I will never be able to get the squelches out of my mind they all had lifeless eyes and turned around to look at me as I stood there crying my eyes out Tommy said 

"Mommy it's okay you don't need to worry just come with us be one of us" as his voice slowly distorted from that Sweet Child like voice to a raspy demonic voice then the bunny man grabbed me I screamed knowing there was only one thing I could do I took the knife out of Tommy and stabbed the bunny man in the eye giving me enough time to run out the front door to the car and speed off.


It has been 6 years since and I have brought this story to the police multiple times there is no evidence. The house was searched but it was all inconclusive no DNA no bodies it has been so tough for me witnessing that it is christmas time again I have a new husband and a daughter I just fear it's going to come back again to get me.
