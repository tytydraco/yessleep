*If you ever feel a strange chill in the air, then let her be! She just wants to speak.*

It is as if I have been left with permanent scars ever since that night. As if, before vanishing, she ingrained a piece of her chill deep into me, and no matter what I try, I cannot rid myself of it. Every moment I spend awake, the slight chill in me festers on, I think I can feel it even in my rare dreams.

But it always vanishes when I feel the real chill again, whenever I sense that clinging presence while alone, be it during the light of day or a winter night. My body still begins to feel cold whenever that chill approaches, but that outside chill purges away the one which was left inside me, and it almost warms me within.

Whenever I feel her presence again, my mind gets somewhat cloudy, I am terrified at the thought of the events of that night repeating, terrified of not knowing if a by chance choice of words was all that had saved me from dying from that cold, but I also feel almost excited by the thought of her appearing again. I have never seen anything, no, anyone like her before in the manor, and that makes me much too curious about what and who she is, dangerously curious even. Though ever since she vanished that night, she did not appear in form for several days, no matter how much I fought through my fear to call at the cold for her to appear again.

Until four days ago, that is when she showed herself again.

That cold morning, I was by the large, fenced wall which surrounds the manor, it is old and poorly held together, staving off unfortunate explorers by its form rather than its function. There is a large board near the front of the manor which I always try to steer clear of, it is quite loose, and large enough for a large person to be able to grab it free and come inside.

Just like every morning, the plank had fallen to the ground, leaving a large gap in the fence, and just like every morning, the Detective was on the scene there. Examining the splinters on the grass with the fitting magnifying glass, dressed in a dark brown coat and hat which did not look like they belonged in the 21^(st) century.

“It seems to me that there was a break in last night, ma’am. Board’s torn right off the fence, nasty business it is.”, I had heard variations of those words hundreds of mornings, for as long as I could remember that anomaly being present on the wall.

“That seems quite serious,”, I said, “Should I be worried, officer?”, the Detective always seemed fully focused on the same examinations he had done for as long as I could remember, determination always in his eyes, though always along with a hint of regret, for what, that I did not know. Asking him questions about his *work* seemed to always lighten it slightly.

“Such a breach has worrying implications, yes, though I shall try my very best to bring this burglar to justice even if it ends up being the last thing I do! In the meantime, however, it would be best to exercise caution, our criminal does not shy away from such destruction of property so who knows what kind of violence he may not refrain from if given the chance!”, his voice cracked as he mentioned the burglar. Of all the *residents* of the manor, the Burglar was the one I still feared the most, I had seldom ever faced him by myself, yet those few moments had been enough for me to avoid venturing near the fence at night.

“But in the meantime, I shall try to repair this fence, make it sturdier and mightier such that my enemy shall be shocked to see its new strength! I can just imagine the look on his shadowed face!”, he picked up the board from the ground, it would not be repaired until I placed my sight away. Despite the Detective’s hard labour, it would be breached again every night either way.

“It is reassuring to see your work, officer, I can’t imagine how such a common criminal could possibly evade you while you work so hard!”, his back was turned to him, though I am sure he smiled, “Have you by chance… seen someone new around the manor? She somewhat resembles me, but paler, and has a strange glow around herself.”

“I am afraid that I have seen no such individual, ma’am, though if there has been another intrusion then I shall readily investigate it right after I have dealt with this burglar!”, not being able to be helpful dulled his expression, I regretted inquiring to him about that.

Having soured the morning already, I headed back towards the manor, intending to drown myself in distraction in the library. But as I walked towards the porch, I stopped. A familiar chill had returned to me while the one within me had warmed.

“I haven’t felt you outside the manor before,”, I softly called, “Does the air feel freer to you here? Can you even feel a difference? I would love to know. I hope you can.”, as I had come to accept, there was no response, but I continued speaking on, “I love the air outside here, in this season especially does it smell so free, so empty of impurities. It can put anyone’s mind at ease, whether they feel it or not. Do you feel it?”

I looked around on the spot, and also noticed that unlike other encounters, the chill had not grown, nor was it as strong as it often was. I looked around me and then towards the manor. I noticed her then.

I saw her inside from the open window of my bedroom, the same one which had woken me that night. She was inside, observing me through the opening. From down there, I could not discern her eyes nor her expression, nor have a good look at her pale form or her ethereal hair.

I stood down there, meeting her gaze over me, thinking of what else to say, thinking about whether she could hear me from up there. I hoped she could. “It is pleasant and free outside those walls, why take in servings of the air from inside when it is aplenty out here? There are so many things we could share.”, every encounter I attempted with words to make her act more, they had been mostly unsuccessful.

But this time she did something which she had not before. There was some noticeable distance between the two of us, yet from all the way down there I still noticed the faint movement of her mouth.

I did not hear the words.

My body almost acted on its own, I did not stay still anymore, and ran without control into the manor, past the halls and stairs towards my bedchamber where she stood, the part of my mind which was not blinded likely knew that she would not be there, but the rest of me did not listen.

I was lucky that the fisherman was not there on the porch, else I would have forgotten to return his greeting.

She was gone from the chamber by the time I reached it, and the chill left within me ceased its warmth. I could have cried in frustration, wondering if I would have heard her words if I instead simply walked closer to the window. That day, the chill she had left in me became stronger, as if in punishment. I did not feel her presence again that day.

 

She first spoke to me three days ago.

Close to my bedchamber, connected to it by a long hall protruding out of the main structure of the manor, lies the library. It is single largest room we have there, and the only one which I have never seen any of the dead, whether resident or visitor, regularly appear in. Even the Housekeeper tends to avoid it, leaving the task of dusting the old books to me, for the few moments when one of them has been in there, they have always left quickly, and appeared almost distressed, though none could ever explain why. It gets almost lonely in there because of that, though I *used to* be fine being fully alone.

I was inside, walking between the large shelves, not intending on being productive but not quite wanting to waste time either, just wandering around, letting my thoughts drift to unseemly places.

That is when I felt her presence again, and excitement again began to flare up along with hope that it would not just be her cold again. The library was an unfortunate choice for such a thing, the room is large, and the shelves rise almost to the ceiling, creating a mini labyrinth where you can never quite place your eyes on the entire room.

With the growing chill, I made my way towards the door to the hallway, observing everything in the corners of my eyes to catch a familiar glow. When I reached the door, I opened it, and, while facing as much of the library as I could I said, “It would be better if you came outside, right here into the hallway perhaps like you first did? This place has an awful air to it, you would be much more comfortable there than behind one of those shelves.”

I tried to control the tone of those words, but I was concerned as I spoke, for I did not know what being in the library might do to her, and her being distressed may lead to a repeat of that night.

“I would at least love if you came out from behind those shelves, it would be great if we could see each wouldn’t it? You are in form here, aren’t you?”, as it so happened, she was. I saw her move for the first time as she slowly drifted out from behind a shelf surprisingly close to me, her legs did not move as she did.

I controlled my other feelings, “I think I saw you trying to speak yesterday. I am sorry that I could not hear, but I am closer now, close enough to listen to all that you may want to say!”

She continued looking at me in that familiar way, completely still except for her ethereal hair which always strangely floated just a bit. I held my breath as I saw the slightest movement on her face.

“*Closer.*”

I exhaled, and then cautiously began to move towards her, but doubt made me hesitate. I did not know how the library had affected her, if at all, and my mind could not help drift back to the last time I had been this close to her, that night. I was anxious.

“Why don’t we go outside? This room is strange, and you have been there in that hallway before, we could be as close as you wish while you speak all that you wish.”, I did not go closer to her, waiting to see if she would be upset.

Her expression saddened, resembling the same one which she had donned that night, and fear broke in me as I expected to feel that deadly cold again. But I could not bear to run, but I was lucky, for nothing that I expected happened.

Instead, she came closer to me as I stood there. Drifting without moving until she was right before me. And rather than the chill growing as I expected, it subsided, including the one that had been left behind in me since that night.

“*It is different here.”,* she spoke. Her voice was like a soft echo, “*I can speak without fear here, why? Do you know?”*

Hearing her speak like that made me almost forget to answer, but I snapped out of it, “The others always hate it here, they feel afraid here, yet you do not. Are you different from them?”

“*I am only me, am I different?”*

“I have not seen anyone like you before. You are new, you are unique. I want to know why, though it is alright if you do not know yourself.”

She blinked, had she ever done that before?

*“What is your name?”, she asked.*

*No.*

“I- um,”, I stammered, she seemed to grow curious at that, “I am sorry, I don-t want t- I cannot speak my name. Please, I cannot say it.”, of all the questions, why did it have to be that?

*“I don’t like it when you are scared so.”*, she said, “*I will tell you mine, if you tell me yours, how about that?”*

She did not understand. “No, I am sorry, it is nothing like that. I just, cannot say my name without danger. There is someone else here, they do not like it when I say it, or if it is visible anywhere, or even hinted at. I am sorry.”, I hated it.

*“Is it the fisherman? I have seen him, I can tell him off if you wish.”,* for the first time, she had something that could resemble a frown.

“No, he has nothing to do with it. You don’t nee- ”, she drifted around me.

*“The housekeeper? The thief? The Philosopher? I want to know your name.”*

“No, I am sorry but there is nothing that I, or anyone, can do about that. Please understand.”

Her ethereal face furrowed; I didn’t like how it looked when she did that. Then the chill began to grow, the same one which I had felt that night, but faster. I gasped, “No, please I am sorry! Please try to stop that!”

And it did stop. She panted, I don’t think I had seen her do that before either. *“I always spread it without reason, I have hurt so many this way… I hurt you that night too, didn’t I? I wish I didn’t but, fear comes to me easier than hope.”,* she looked upwards around herself, *“I must go for now.”*

“No! Please stay!”, I pleaded, “I want to know more about you! You have never spoken like this before!”

*“I will appear again, you always know when I am there, even when I do not know that you are,”*

And then she simply faded away from where she stood. I was left feeling empty.

I did not feel her presence again that day, I hoped that meant that she would only appear in form from then on wards.

 

She appeared again the next day, two days ago.

I had developed a habit of spending many tiring nights observing that torn board from my bed-chamber’s windows. Every morning the Detective would conduct his investigation and repair it before disappearing after I would leave him. And then every night his culprit would tear down the board again, sawing at it from the outside and then wandering around near the breach for most of the early night, dressed completely in black as you would expect from one such as him.

It was entertaining to observe from a distance, though I had learned well to not go near him. The Housekeeper had to save me once, the Fisherman did another day, and I managed to escape his actions myself the third time. I had learned my lesson after the third time.

But as I watched the sun set from the warmth of that room, I started to feel her presence again. And I was excited by it as I observed the corners of the room to see where she would appear, I even stood and looked in a corner for a while to see if that would make her appear sitting on the bed again.

But nothing like that happened, I instead looked outside and saw her standing under a tree in the yard, close to the still fine fence. She glowed in the twilight, and she looked at me from there. She had chosen an inconvenient location.

I dressed myself as best as I could for the winter evening, having learned well from that night, and headed down the stairs and towards the manor’s door. The Fisherman was there on the porch still, he greeted me, and I returned his greeting out of necessity, but nothing more.

I quickly went over to the tree under which she stood, my arms around me because of the cold. She looked at me as I approached, and her glow lit up the evening mist all around her, creating a dreamlike visage.

“Why appear out here? It is difficult for me to bear the cold here.”, she did not respond, “Can you still speak outside of the library?”, I asked.

*“It is harder outside. I didn’t want to appear outside. I am sorry.”*

“It is not your fault!”, I softly said, “Why did you leave yesterday? I hoped we could talk more there.”

*“I was sad because I wanted to know your name, I know you cannot say it, but it was hard to accept then.”*

“It is alright, I know how disappointing it must be.”, I thought of what else to say, “Can you not choose where you appear in form?”

She appeared to think long and hard, it was as if she grew more human with every encounter. Though I she did not have a lack of it in the first place, I think.

*“It is difficult to answer that here.”*

“Can you not move somewhere else while in for-?”, a creak of wood interrupted me, and I turned towards the damaged board. The harsh cuts of a saw pierced the air as the board gave way and a dark clothed arm appeared through the gap.

She gasped as I looked at her, she had never done that before either, and I saw genuine fear in her face then as the Burglar got through the breach. She faded way, her expression frozen like that. It was too late to run back inside, or hide.

The Burglar looked at me, his mouth and eyes were all that weren’t covered in that block cloth. He grinned and sprinted towards me with unnatural speed, his saw vanished and was replaced by a pocketknife, less dangerous, but it would still hurt. I had to hold my ground.

“Stop.”, I commanded with as much authority as I could, and did not move from where I stood. He did stop, but that smile did not vanish from his face.

“*You do not run this time!”,* he exclaimed, *“This would make this so much easier, haha…”,* his soft laugh could not be forgotten after you heard it.

“Do you really want to do something to me? Because I think you should wonder more about whether you *could* than whether you should. I have so many friends here, both alive and dead, what makes you think you could ever bear all their wrath at once?”

He returned a strong grin, and dangled his knife from his hand like a pendulum, “*Ah, but I do not see any of these friends here, do I? I could add to my list here, have my fun, and be off before anyone notices what is wrong! You really do ought to try to run, you know.”,* he stepped closer to me, knife dangling side to side.

I feigned a frustrated sigh, “What makes you even think that little knife would do the job? Do you think I would be host to countless dead, both visitors and those who forever live *under* me, while being so helpless?”, his grin faded, if just a bit.

He help up his knife and observed it thoroughly, *“It is a pretty decent knife, I think. So, ya I think it would get the job done.”,* he held it in a seasoned grip and seemed as if he was prepared to strike. I did not run, it was a bold decision.

“Your final moments in this world would be overestimating yourself, move against me and I will ensure that you die a proper death. I will sever whatever your remaining link which prevents you from moving on is, and in whatever comes next, perhaps you could introspect on your deluded choices. Though if I were you, I would start doing that already, for you will not be able to think in the beyond.”

He was only slightly phased by that, but I saw him shiver slightly, he seemed frustrated, his grin was fully gone now.

*“You know…,”,* he looked around himself, “*It is rather cold here, isn’t it? I didn’t know I could feel that still… haha…”,* his final laugh broke before it ended, and I watched as he faded away just I had seen her do so often.

I exhaled and leaned against the tree, afraid that my legs would give way.

She did not appear that night again, and I wonder why the Burglar scared her so, though I remember her cold more fondly now.

I hope I can tell her my name one day, though that is still wistful thinking.
