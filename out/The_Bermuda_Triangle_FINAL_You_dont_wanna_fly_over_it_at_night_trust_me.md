I’m probably breaking about a million NDAs by posting this but it doesn’t matter, the public, you have the right to know and nothing is going to change that.

Done? Okay, let’s continue with the story. Jackson and his friends from the NTSB took me to an undisclosed facility God knows where. I’m not joking, I spent the better part of the seven-hour journey napping and guess what, that thing didn’t plague me at all. I guess the theory of it being attached to something I took on that flight was true after all.


  
 
  
Anyway, we arrived at an office of the NTSB, the security had a look at Jackson’s and the suits’ IDs and after giving me a glance over – my Driving License was under their custody anyways, they waved us through. Instead of going through the front door like normal people would, the crew went into a subterranean garage.


  
 
  
They parked the Cadillac and we went into an elevator and Jackson surprised me by inserting a card into a card reader. The lift knew where to go as it started to descend, and no, the digital display didn’t indicate the floor numbers. I had a sneaking suspicion that we were going to a highly secretive facility that only a few people knew about and I was proven right as the elevator doors opened.


  
 
  
We piled into a dimly lit lobby and were greeted by a big made man,


  
 
  
“Welcome team Bravo, I see you have returned with our guest”


  
 
  
“Yes boss,” said Daniel. The boss smiled at Jackson,


  
 
  
“I can’t say I’m surprised, congratulations on the promotion Jackson”
  
 


  
“Thank you boss”


  
 
  
“And do forgive me Captain” he said, looking at me, “We are unable to shake anyone’s hands as it can cause issues with the energy fluctuations. And you can call me ‘Boss’ ”


  
 
  
“All right Boss,” I said, trying to be a part of the team.


  
 
  
The boss was satisfied with our answers and nodded at Jackson, who no doubt was the leader of team Bravo. Jackson told us to follow him and we went down a corridor that had several doors set into it. We opened one and were greeted by an apartment. Did I forget to mention that there were no windows by any chance? I guessed that we were underground.


  
 
  
We, or rather the G men dumped their equipment on the floor and faced me. Jackson raised his hands,


  
 
  
“You might be having a lot of questions, that we’ll answer”


  
 
  
“Fine,” I said, “First of all, who are you guys?”


  
 
  
Daniel was the guy who answered that,
  
“We are a division of the NTSB known as EDO or the Extraordinary Divisions Organization and we answer directly to the Pentagon. We research anomalies reported by anyone focusing on transportation”
  
 


  
I turned to Jackson,
  
“Hold on buddy, I’m pretty sure you were just an NTSB inspector last time I checked”


  
 
  
Jackson shrugged,
  
“I was until I got promoted. Hell, that’s why we didn’t tell you anything until you signed the NDA”


  
 
  
Yeah well, I just broke it.


  
 
  
John opened up the duffel bag and took out a pack of what looked like a computer monitor,


  
 
  
“Truth be told Cap’n, we are very very interested in the Bermuda Triangle and this is the first time we have experienced anyone with ah, after effects”


  
 
  
“What’s the plan?”  I asked him sitting on the sofa. The G Men shrugged,


  
 
  
“We’re on quarantine. We need to be in this decontamination chamber for a few hours until the Boss man briefs us”
  
 


  
Wow, I was stuck with these guys for another couple of hours. Jackson assured me that his old team was taking care of the belongings that I had left behind and that I would only have to ask to get something provided to me.
  
 


  
This was early in the morning, so I decided to take a nap. The apartment had two rooms and I decided to bunk it with Jackson. I slept soundly without the thing disturbing my peace.


  
 
  
We were called down for breakfast and the Boss informed us that we were to be present at 0930 hours in the briefing room sharp. That was fine with me.
  
 


  
0930 saw us in a normal conference room, set up with a smart board and a couple of chairs. The four of us, along with the Boss, whose name no one knew and a couple of people in what looked like military uniforms were present at the briefing. The Boss started to speak first, his deep voice resonating in the small room,
  
 


  
“Ladies and Gentleman, as you are all aware by now, our primary focus is the Bermuda Triangle”
  
 
  
The smart board flickered to life, highlighting the area on a map.


  
 
  
“A pilot, Captain Chris and his first officer Jim of \[REDACTED\] airlines experienced something that interests us greatly. Captain, why don’t you explain what happened?”


  
 
  
I stood up and recounted the story, secretly hoping no one laughed at me or that I was secretly in a psych hospital. Everyone’s faces however displayed either horror or shock. Jackson cleared his throat,
  
 


  
“For the record everyone, Jim recounts no sightings of the entity except the initial encounter. We have concluded that the entity has anchored itself to possession of the Captain’s that he took on that flight”


  
 
  
I raised my hand,
  
 


  
“Captain?”


  
 
  
“Wait, you government types seriously believe this?”


  
 
  
The Boss smiled and motioned a guy in a lab coat, a scientist to speak to us. The scientist stood up and went to the podium,


  
 
  
“All right folks. To answer your question Cap’n, we believe in the laws of energy thoroughly. We have observed that there is a slight anomaly in the area of the Bermuda Triangle, in terms of this energy. When Jackson here reported your incident to his superiors we were ordered to step in. We have found that the energy signature of your house, is different to the surroundings, suggesting something Extraordinary is going on”


  
 
  
“So… nothing paranormal?” I asked him cautiously. The scientist smiled,


  
 
  
“I’m afraid not Cap’n. It’s all to do with the energy”


  
 
  
“Then what about the flight then? That place we went to?” I asked him. Don’t blame me, I came here to find answers.


  
 
  
The scientist looked a bit less sure of himself,


  
 
  
“That is still under observation, to be honest”


  
 
  
The Boss motioned for the scientist to sit down and dominated the podium once again,


  
 
  
“What we are interested in is this entity that you spoke about Captain. We have been observing the Triangle for the past few years and yet, we haven’t observed such energy spikes as we are now. We are testing your belongings for traces of residual energy but it is still under progress”


  
 
  
“For the benefit of team Bravo,” said another military-type man, “We managed to borrow a satellite that is recording every single thing that is going on in that area. We will keep observing the energy fluctuations and brief you once we are done. That’s it, gentlemen”


  
 
  
The briefing left me confused and tossing and turning in my bunk bed. Was there such a huge amount of energy that could create another world? I didn’t buy it for a second. The science team had a breakthrough after two weeks. The higher-ups were pressing Boss – they needed the satellite back.


  
 
  
“I don’t know how to explain this,” he said, calling us to the office, “But the talisman seems to have another energy signature emitting from it”


  
 
  
“Kate believed in it a lot,” I said a bit angrily. She should have worn that damn thing when she went over the Triangle the day she went missing, maybe she would have survived.


  
 
  
I poured over the NTSB records for the incident by the way and nothing on that three-page folder told me anything useful, other than the time and day she had gone on the flight which I bought to the attention of the Boss.


  
 
  
He surveyed the four of us,


  
 
  
“I want you, team Bravo to take up the challenge of finding out what goes on in the triangle. Our analysts have informed me that on the night of the full moon, at precisely 9:39 pm, a sharp spike, only for a fraction of a second, at a particular point in the triangle occurs”


  
 
  
“Let me guess Boss,” said Daniel, “It coincided with Chris’s flight path”


  
 
  
(Yeah I told them not to call me Captain, it gets annoying after a while)


  
 
  
The Boss pointed his pen at Daniel,


  
 
  
“Atta boy!”


  
 
  
“Sir” began John a bit fearfully, “You’re not suggesting that we fly into the Triangle are you?”


  
 
  
The Boss grinned,


  
 
  
“But I am”
  
 


  
Things escalated pretty fast from that point onward. The full moon was approaching in a week and we had to be prepared. Strangely enough, the talisman didn’t burn me when I held it this time, leading Jackson to suggest that maybe something I had in my wallet at that time was triggering it.


  
 
  
The science team had several opinions that the triggers were the stuff I kept in my wallet. Anyway, we exercised and ‘geared up’ as the military team would say for that day as it loomed closer.


  
 
  
The team would be the four of us, three grunts and the two pilots. The Boss and the science team would run the ground OPs from the base. Oh and before you ask, no, I still had no idea where we were, I slept on the way mostly. I suspect the G Men might have spiked my coffee but at least I have good free food here.


  
 
  
On the day of departure, we loaded our backpacks, double-checked our communications equipment and ran a bunch of last-minute checks. My jaw dropped when the Boss led us to the Hangar.


  
 
  
We were to fly on one of the [aircraft](https://imgur.com/PDQVpQj) in development, something that defied all explanation. It looked like an alien craft, with its slim and sleek design. It looked like a cross between a plane and a helicopter and I admired its stealthy-looking design. The Boss was nervous,


  
 
  
“The Pentagon wasn’t happy about loaning this bad boy. Try not to get a scratch on it eh?”

&#x200B;


  
The interior was exactly like the exterior of the aircraft. Plush leather seats that looked like they belonged on a luxury jet awaited us and of course, me being me, couldn’t resist checking the cockpit out.


  
 
  
Let’s be very clear here, there are two types of pilots in their late forties like me. Pilots who hate computerized modern cockpits and prefer the olden style gauge typed cockpits and pilots like me, who loved the computerization and digital screens. For the life of me, I couldn’t understand why on earth anyone would want to read off the gauges that took ages to find. Anyway, I was blown away by the sheer design of it.


  
 
  
Large digital displays surrounded the pilots, who had joysticks to control the aircraft. I gave the pilots the thumbs up and went to join the team. After a final comms check of our gear, we got the all-clear to take off.
  
 


  
The take-off was extremely smooth and once in the air, the pilot grinned at us,


  
 
  
“I dunno if anyone told you but this baby can reach almost three times the speed of sound, so buckle up gents. And we’re flying at forty thousand feet to avoid the other aircraft”


  
 
  
“Wow,” said Daniel clapping his hands, “We’ll be there in no time huh?”


  
 
  
I looked at the team, I had gotten to know them well during the two weeks and Daniel was an outgoing guy. Jackson was, well Jackson but John spoke only when necessary, and that was not much.


  
 
  
Anyways, once we had reached our cruising altitude, Jackson sent the grunts to the cockpit, there was something he wanted to tell us, and us only. He indicated that we switch off our comms and said in a grave voice,


  
 
  
“I’m not buying that energy explanation for a second. There is something sinister going on there and we need to stop it at all costs. Got it?”


  
 
  
He looked hard at me and I nodded,


  
 
  
“Roger”


  
 
  
The other men followed with John simply nodding. The NTSB had provided us with what they called Energy Blasters, which shot superheated plasma at anything that it encountered. I had a feeling that the aircraft was fitted with something equally frightening as well. And in case you were wondering, I, being a private citizen was not allowed to carry the firearm but had the talisman with me, something equally dangerous.

&#x200B;


  
I noticed a change in the pitch of the engines and the pilots called over the intercom stating that we were a couple of miles away from insertion into the Triangle.


  
 
  
We buckled our seatbelts and waited for the inevitable. The aircraft slowed down and started inching forward, something no normal plane would have been able to do. And then it came. The Jolt.


  
 
  
The aircraft jolted suddenly to the right and we looked at each other in grim determination, this was it. I looked outside as the aircraft suddenly rightened itself.


  
 
  
“Wow!” said Jackson looking mesmerized by the clouds starting to form a [vortex](https://imgur.com/n2M4VG2), slowly spinning and gaining speed. I looked at my watch, it was 9.39. The aircraft started to shudder as the pilots engaged the corrective actions. In my defence, I didn’t have the privilege of practising this manoeuvre 1000 times in the simulator when I did it.


  
 
  
“What the hell is that?!” shrieked one of the grunts.


  
 
  
We looked outside and sure enough, the portal to hell was forming once again. All the pilots said was,


  
 
  
“Brace yourself, we’re going in!”


  
 
  
The nose of the aircraft tipped towards the vortex as the engines screamed bloody murder. We shot like a bullet towards the vortex and I closed my eyes. The shuddering stopped and we were in the calm once again. Jackson was speechless,


  
 
  
“The Energy spike must be creating a rip in spacetime”


  
 
  
“It looks like…hell,” said Daniel shuddering.


  
 
  
“Can you control this thing?” I asked the pilots who looked glumly at me, “The controls aren’t responding anymore”


  
 
  
“We’ve lost contact with Ground” said a grunt who was updating everyone back at base.


  
 
  
At once, the mist started to form outside the plane and as discussed earlier, the pilots eased it onto the red, rocky soil. We waited in silence until the mist intensified and the temperature dropped rapidly.


  
 
  
No one was ready for what happened next. Of course, the [thing](https://imgur.com/DfngO8e) appeared inside the plane.


  
 
  
The thing didn’t care about the rifles aimed at it. It just smiled, showing those pointy teeth.


  
 
  
“Ooooh you came back” it said.


  
 
  
“State your purpose!” commanded Jackson forcefully. The thing looked at him,


  
 
  
“Chrisssss shall rrremain herrre. I neeeeeed himmmmm”


  
 
  
“Where is Kate?”


  
 
  
At the mention of the word, something happened to the thing, it’s featureless face changed into the sweet face of Kate, with its burning coal eyes turning into her deep blue eyes.


  
 
  
I was at a loss for words,


  
 
  
“Kate…” I moaned, almost running to hug her. Daniel held out an arm, stopping me.


  
 
  
“Oh, Chris darling,” said Kate, tears starting to form in her eyes, “You need to leave. Please, this entity will take you too”


  
 
  
“Baby I can’t leave you” I whispered,


  
 
  
“The talisman,” said John’s voice. I looked at the usually emotionless guy and was shocked to see his face. He looked sad and almost looked like he was fighting back tears. This was the first time I had seen him express any sort of emotion.


  
 
  
“Gimme,” said Kate.


  
 
  
I could see that she was fighting to control her human body,


  
 
  
“This thing feeds off humans Chris, every soul who comes to this dimension is doomed. Please give me the Talisman. Free us all”
  
 


  
I handed her the Talisman with shaking fingers and screamed a cry of agony as she plunged it into her chest. John fainted on the floor of the plane, surprising Daniel.


  
 
  
There was a guttural roar as the dark grey mist poured out of Kate’s chest and the thing appeared, its eyes burning with hate. But the Talisman had done its job.


  
 
  
The thing faded into oblivion but not before giving me a parting souvenir, as it tried to grab me. A smoky tentacle wrapped around me, that felt like lava on my skin.


  
 
  
Unsurprisingly, we tried to figure out a way to get back into our dimension until Jackson noticed that the portal was open. The pilots used the vector-thruster engines to turn us around and we were back on Earth.


  
 
  
Oh, you want to know what the souvenir that thing gave me was, don’t you? I was proud of my skin, but contact with the thing in it had given me a greyish mark on my forearm, where the tentacle made contact, almost like a brand.


  
 
  
After getting debriefed and warned not to share my story with anyone, I wanted to find out what John’s involvement was with this.


  
 
  
I asked him, just as he dropped me off at my house. He looked at me like I was the dumbest person on Earth,


  
 
  
“Kate’s my sister”
