After my brother died, I didn’t know who I was anymore.

He was my only living family. My big brother, my protector, my closest friend. After we lost our mom when I was twelve and our dad bailed, it was always just the two of us. He raised me, basically. Cooked me dinner, walked me to school, taught me how to shave. The guy never asked for credit, never played the martyr. He just… showed up. Every day. Without him, I felt like a hollowed-out version of myself. Like I’d been cracked open and everything good had leaked out.

I tried therapy. Didn’t click. Tried antidepressants. They numbed me to the point I couldn’t even cry. Then, one night, I saw a flyer posted in the corner of the window at a coffee shop I used to go to with him. Black background, white serif font, simple:

*We can’t bring back the dead… but we can help you feel close to them again.*  
*Grief Support Circle – Thursdays at 9pm.*  
*Wear red.*

It was weird. Red? Why? But I was raw. Desperate. Curious.

The church basement where they met was maybe two neighborhoods over from where I live. Run-down, clearly forgotten by time. I hesitated at the top of the stairs for a full minute before going in.

The light came from candles. Dozens of them. No electricity. The room smelled like melted wax and old wood and something earthy, like dried leaves.

About twenty people sat in a circle on folding chairs. All of them were wearing red in some form—scarves, shawls, even a full red cloak on one woman with eyes like cloudy glass. I wore a red hoodie. No one batted an eye.

The circle leader introduced herself as Marla. She looked like a librarian or a kindergarten teacher—graying hair tied back, calm voice, gentle eyes. She thanked me for being brave enough to come.

Then she asked if I wanted to share.

I didn’t plan to speak. But something about the room—the silence, the stillness, the soft flickering light, the way everyone actually seemed to *listen*—it broke something loose in me. I started talking about my brother. Our stupid inside jokes. How he used to let me stay up and watch horror movies with him when I was too young. How he smelled like peppermint and clean laundry. How he held my hand at our mom’s funeral and whispered to me that I still had him. That I always would

I hadn’t told anyone that before. Not even my partner. I cried harder than I’d cried since the day I lost him.

And after the tears dried, I felt… lighter. Not healed. Not okay. But somehow, less alone.

The meeting ended with a chant. Everyone stood, held hands, and hummed—not a tune, exactly, but something low and vibrating. A single word repeated again and again: “Velushta.” No one explained what it meant.

When it was over, I thanked Marla. She just touched my shoulder and said that I was seen tonight.

It was strange. A little culty, sure. But it helped.

So I went back the next week.

The second meeting was smaller. Only ten of us this time. Still candlelit. Still wordless at first. Still that hum of calm like being in the eye of a storm.

A guy named Leo shared about his son who’d died in a car crash. He placed a small, tattered stuffed bear in the center of the circle. Marla nodded solemnly and said offerings help the departed find us.

That’s when I noticed them—items scattered in the middle of the circle. Old toys. Wedding rings. Worn-out sneakers. A lock of hair tied with string. At first glance, it just looked like junk.

Then I realized… every item belonged to someone dead.

That week, I brought a photo of my brother. Us at the beach when I was maybe five. I left it in the circle without saying anything. No one questioned it. Marla just nodded.

And that night, I dreamed of him.

Not the usual hazy memory replay I’d been having. It was vivid. He sat on the edge of my bed, smiling at me, eyes soft, hair messy. He said he was still here. I just needed to listen better.

I woke up sobbing. But also… grateful.

I told myself that’s what group therapy is like, right? You open up, you process, you start to heal. The rituals, the red clothes, the chanting—it was all just framing. Symbolic. Nothing supernatural. Just grief dressed up with structure.

Right?

It was my fifth meeting when the cracks started to show.

We had a newcomer—a woman maybe in her forties, looking completely shattered. Makeup smeared, hands shaking, red scarf bunched around her neck like a noose. She sat down, whispered her name—Jessa—and said her daughter had died of sepsis. Only six years old.

She didn’t cry. Just stared at the floor like it might swallow her.

When the circle ended, Jessa started gasping. Shaking. Panic attack. Marla calmly approached her, knelt, and placed a small Herkimer diamond on her chest.

Instant silence. Jessa slumped in her chair. Eyes closed. Breathing deep. Everyone else seemed completely unfazed. Me? I wanted to bolt. But I didn’t. Because I was still sleeping better. Still dreaming of my brother. Still waking up to the sound of his voice whispering my name from deep inside my skull. And that didn’t scare me. It comforted me.

Until the sixth meeting.

I brought my brother’s hoodie with me that night.

I’d been saving it. It still smelled like him—faintly—after all this time. I kept it in a sealed plastic bag at the back of my closet like it was a holy relic. I wasn’t even sure why I brought it. Maybe I just wanted to see him more clearly in my dreams. Maybe I wanted him to *talk* to me again, like he had that first night.

I left it in the center of the circle like everyone else did. Marla gave me that same calm, approving nod. The chanting that night was louder. Longer. There was something different about it. The rhythm pulsed, like a heartbeat. Everyone’s voices were deeper. Not in pitch, but in weight, like they were singing from somewhere below ground.

Then it happened.

The air dropped ten degrees in a blink. I could see my own fogged breath rise into the candlelight. The flames flickered, hissed… then died, one by one, as if something was walking through the center of the circle snuffing out each one individually.

Darkness swallowed the room. It was silent for a moment. No one moved. I heard someone quietly weeping.

Then—footsteps. Slow. Wet. Uneven. Like bare feet slapping on a stone floor. I couldn’t see anything, but I could feel it. The thing that entered the circle wasn’t human. It felt like gravity bent slightly around it.

The smell came first. Like rotting meat mixed with burned rubber and bile. Then the voice.

It wasn’t *spoken*. It was inside my head.

“You said always…”

And suddenly I was ten again, crouched behind the couch at our mom’s funeral, whispering to my brother that I’d never leave him. That he’d always have me.

That moment had been private. Sacred. No one else was there. No one could’ve known. But the voice repeated it. My voice. *From then*. Over and over, like a recording dragged across broken glass.

The candles sputtered back to life. And it was standing there. Tall. Wearing my brother’s hoodie. But the thing inside it wasn’t him.

Its limbs were too long. Its skin looked like wax pulled over bones. The hoodie hung wrong, stretched too tight across a chest that rose and fell in jerky, irregular bursts. Its mouth was open, too wide, like rubber stretched to tearing. Its eyes—or what should’ve been eyes—were tiny black pits that *oozed*. Thick, greenish bile dripped from them onto the floor.

It stepped forward. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t scream. All I could do was *stare* as it tilted its head toward me.

“Always,” it whispered again in my voice.

And that snapped something loose in me.

I bolted.

The others stood as one. Their faces blank. Their mouths moving silently. Their arms reached for me—but I was near the door. I shoved past them, hit the stairs, and didn’t stop running until I was in my car with the engine screaming and the gas pedal slammed to the floor.

I didn’t look back.

That was five nights ago. I haven’t left my apartment since. I keep every light on. I’ve blocked the windows. I don’t sleep more than an hour at a time.

The first night, I told myself I imagined it. That it was a grief-induced hallucination. The second night, I found the hoodie folded neatly at the foot of my bed. It was still wet. It still reeked. The third night, I heard someone breathing just outside my front door. Soft, deliberate breaths. Like they were waiting for me to open it. The fourth night, my phone played a voice memo I didn’t record. It was me, crying, whispering, don’t leave me. Please don’t leave me. Except it wasn’t from any moment I remember.

And last night? Last night I woke up at 3:33 AM.

The lights were off. All of them. My phone was dead. My laptop was unplugged. Even the glow from the router was gone. 

But candles were lit. Dozens of them arranged in a circle. And in the middle of the room, right where my coffee table used to be, someone had written a word on the hardwood floor in a dark, wet smear: 

RETURN.

I don’t know if it was a message or a command.

But I know this:

Someone—or *something*—wants me back.

And I think they’re done waiting.
