This is my honest experience when I was in boarding school.

For some context, my school is pretty strict and conservative. 

Everyday after dinner at 6pm, we are made to stay in the hall to pray until 8.30pm. 

I was a senior then, and had a friend who had the privilege to be responsible for the keys to the computer room. 

Surprise, surprise, he was not responsible with it. Which may or may not be due to my influence.

Me and him would regularly skip prayers, and spend our time in the computer room.

Since we were breaking the rules, We wouldn't turn on the lights and would hide our shoes inside to conceal our presence. 

We would normally sit far away from each other since he uses the admin PC close to the entrance while I used the PC in the far corner of the room since that was the only regular PC that could bypass our school's Wi-fi.

On this particular night, something felt off from the get go, the room felt quieter and colder than usual, to the point that I will start looking over my shoulder because I felt something was watching me. 

At one point, my friend told me that he felt sleepy and he will take a nap.

As time went by the feeling got worse and I started to be more aware of my surroundings. 

(It should be noted that most of the PC's are left in sleep mode, a move of the mouse or a click from the keyboard wakes the screen up) 

On the corner of my eye, I saw the PC at the end of my row lit up, my mind started to go wild. 

A few seconds later the PC right next to me also lit up. 

I immediately tried to text one of my friend who was in the prayer hall: " Hey, its already 9, why haven't you guys finished ?"

(Usually, after the prayers at 8.30 everyone headed for night class until 10.30pm. We would usually slip in the crowd passing by the room as it was the route to class from the hall ) 

My friend replied : " That's what you get from staying in that sin hole" , this M.F., admittedly he was not completely wrong, the computer room gave unsupervised internet to horny teenagers staying in boarding school. 

But still, he could've just told me what happened. 

I tried texting another friend and he replied simply : "Someone's possessed" , Immediately, shivers and cold sweat on my back. 

My boarding school is built on a hill surrounded by forests. Due to its long history, cases of possession is not rare, especially if people do not follow "rules". 

I immediately woke my friend up and told him: " We have to go to the hall, the teachers are doing surprise checks, we would get caught if found absent" I lied of course, I didn't want him to be scared and to run away, because I'm sure that I am slower than him at running.

As we were walking out, he handed me the keys to help lock the door, he wanted to tie his shoes, the door was slightly opened when I turned around to lock it and inside, ALL THE PC SCREENS WAS LIT UP. 

I pretended to not see and immediately shut the door to lock it.   

As we were walking he kept asking what was really happening, and he was suspicious of my reasoning. 

My grip on his forearm to stop him from running could've added to the suspicion IDK. 

Eventually when we were close to the hall I confessed to him that there was a possession happening. 



He was silent for a while, then told me that he was not actually sleeping this whole time. 

His admin PC was right next to the windows.

 He saw a silhouette (because of the curtains) walking in the hallway. 

Thinking it was students walking to class, he took a peek through the curtain gap to make sure but nothing was there. This happened a few times.

Add to the fact that the way the figure was walking was weird, in his words "Like a woman on a skateboard". I think he meant to say hovering, what a weird way to describe it. 

Eventually he figured out that it was something else and he also got scared but didn't want to alert me, so he said he wanted to sleep but actually he was laying down closing his face with his bag, waiting for me to ask him to leave. 

When we arrived at the Prayer Hall it was chaos, but that is the end of my part of ghostly experience. One of many from my high school days.
