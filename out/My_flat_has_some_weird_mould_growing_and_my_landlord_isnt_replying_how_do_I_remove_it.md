There are specifically three times in my life where mould has, rather thematically, seeped in and caused me some kind of trouble.

The first, a classic tale of a damp, shitty council flat, only left standing as an ode to "socially trying" by an even more morally infested 9-5 wage farm cosplaying authority. Our popcorn walls were as thick, bumpy and discoloured as the strained neck of that day's chosen jobworth, daring to benevolently lift a finger so that myself and my twin sister need not live in spore slumber any more. A temporary problem, fixed by sudden relocation to an even smaller and shittier flat further away from our school and friends. 

Every day I thank my lucky stars that the terminally windstarved man who finally moved us didn't break too much of a sweat when handling our relocation process. God forbid his nicotine-stained rosacea experience the same discomfort his wife probably felt seeing him walk through the door daily, after all.

The second one, well, it's a bit more embarrassing. Let's just say that sometimes, the real monster is the chore sock you absent mindedly launch under the bed, only for said sock to be found technically pregnant by your exasperated mother on one of her cleaning rampages months later. Sorry, mum.

The third story, is ongoing. 

I'm writing this, live from my sofa, keeping watch of the wretched mass in the corner. It's been 187 days since I noticed that thing, and in that time, I've come to learn some truths about the ever-expanding smudge that bevels the join of my ceiling and wall.

For one, and this should be pretty obvious to you (if it's not, hopefully the fact that it rhymes will help it click): 

Mould. Isn't. Gold. 

That's why 187 days prior, I recall noticing a single gold fleck, cemented to that corner. I recall spotting it, and having absolutely zero thought along the lines of "this fucking thing is going to ruin my life over the next 6 months". The scale of this fleck is so miniscule, that frankly, I should've paid more mind to the fact that my sudden noticing of it was abnormal itself. I tried brushing it off with my hand, and it stayed. I tried harder. Eventually, I realised I didn't care anymore about a spec of dirt on the wall, and went about my day as normal.

It was only by day 14, that I'd maybe had the inkling of a thought that this was unusual. The gold mass itself had grown to the size of a shirt button, now big enough for my chubby, cushioned hands to actually feel its texture. 

Soft. Sticky. Possibly too sticky, given the not over the top, yet astonishing amount of force i had to apply to unstick my hand. As my hand freed, I was suddenly filled with the overwhelming compulsion to never let my bare skin meet it again. Done 

I went at it with a scraper. Didn't budge. I took a hammer to it - the hammer bounced off with such energy that I was worried I was about to become my favourite type of shark. I summoned contractors with tools so mighty the noise complaints from neighbours lit up my letterbox like the Royal Mail guy dropping off my whiskey and match parcels sans packaging. Sorry, it's a wonky simile, but I'm tired and I cannot exaggerate just how many noise complaint letters I got.

When day 30 rolled around, the landlord had already made his second visit.

"Did you do this then?" he asked, twirling his moustache, other hand pressed to his chin like he was capable of thought "'cos if you did mate, you'd better fix it, or it's coming off your deposit".

I sighed deeply. "No, for the last time, this thing just started growing. It's really sticky, I'm worried about yknow, when I adopt a cat or somethin-"

"IF, you are granted permission to own an animal on my property.  I have yet to approve your animal request, and may I remind you that any and all unauthorized animals..." Mr Gaines interrupted and droned on and on about whatever the fuck it is he usually says. But, at that moment, I was transfixed by the golden nugget that had gifted me the opportunity to once again listen to his shit.

I could have sworn, for the first time, I saw it grow.

"So whatever this is, Sir - please have it removed by tenancy's end. Or, I may have to charge you for an unauthorized pet after all". One day, I hope someone finds me as funny as he found himself in that moment.

It became an obsession. I started taking daily pictures, measurements - at one point I nearly kept a log of the thing's horoscopes. If this was a few years back, it would've had its own twitter account. Yes, part of the interest stemmed from the fact that I would have liked to receive my entire housing deposit back in full, but also, this was something which had continued to stump and confound everyone who saw it.

Day 112 was special. My friend Peter, a stocky castle of a man, had finally managed to agree to let me bring him into the flat. I'm by no means an introvert, but I seldom enjoy having people in my own personal space. He'd nagged relentlessly for years, "Come on mate, let me see the new gaff, you've not even thrown a party yet". Fine, mould party, BYOB.

The other friend who tagged along, David, was somewhat less remarkable in stature. While Peter boasted a large frame with hair cut short as dusk, David was less castle, more tricycle. His longer brown hair grown purely to obscure his mousey features, David was the complete opposite of Peter in many ways. And yet, the three of us, held an unbreakable friendship since our youth, what felt like 900 years ago.

"Holy shit" Peter cried out "you weren't kidding - it's huge. I thought you'd been practicing Photoshop or something. That's gotta be the size of what, a dinner plate?"

David cleared his throat to speak,  a common verbal tick of his, warming up his throat for the few words he dared share. "You know Greg, if that thing is real gold... That's gotta be worth something right?"

I hadn't considered it until that point, but he was right. This thing looked heavy, it looked like it shouldn't be. It looked like money. I liked money.

David moved towards it now, hand outreached. "So you only touched it once right?"

"Yeah"I replied, "When it was about the size of Peter's brain, actually". Peter laughed, then launched a playful but firm punch into my shoulder "Yeah sure Dan, my brain, or your dick!"

We both laughed to eachother, but it quickly became apparent that the kind of joke that would usually have David snorting, had completely passed him by. He was a nosy little shit, so this was unusual, but it was obvious now from his fixed gaze that all he could parse was this golden, crinkled lump that sat like a spider in my corner.

Something was off.

"I can't believe it" David said softly. He started walking towards it now. "You.. you really mean it? Can you do that for me? Just for me..”

Peter and I shot each other a look that we often did, a glare with a subtle hint of "what the shit is this guy on about?" sprinkled all over.

"Mate, what are you doing?" I asked him, fruitlessly. "Are you actually talking to yourself? Do we need to call someone?". It was a question initially phrased as a joke, but on reflection, maybe I should have done it.

If he heard me, he didn't show it. He was now face to face with the mass, presumably inches away if you'd asked someone with working depth perception. I didn't realise it at first, but he hadn't stopped muttering and talking under his breath. Not shutting up was typically one of Peter's traits.

"Bruv, you're freaking me out now" Peter jabbed. "Stop taking the piss already". He started towards David, and as he did, I watched in awe as David pushed his face into the golden mass.

Muffled screams could be heard now. I saw his little dainty legs lift into the air and thrash around, as his body contorted and cracked in an orchestra of sound nobody wanted tickets for.

David began to slowly disappear into it, face first. I don't think Peter realised what was happening, because as he went to grab David, he made the mistake of resting his hand next to the mass, skin rubbing it ever so slightly enough, that the thing got a taste for him.

I could do nothing but watch as my two best friends get sucked into that thing, like juice through a straw, with only their skin based cartons staying behind. My ears swam with blood, blocking out not only the final screams of my Year 4 swimming buddy, but the even eerier joyful silence of my faceless, mini friend.

As quickly as it happened, it ended. Their skins were violently ejected backwards, falling to the floor like someone had deflated one of your dad's special toys. Seconds ago there had been screams - now, the sound of their skin slapping the floor punctuated the end of their life sentence. Even quicker, I felt something change in me. I felt, as what can only be described as a switch flicked in my head, and all the care and agony I'd possessed in that one moment now felt like someone else's hollow retelling.


Over the next few days I observed, as the mass continued to grow. Grew uncomfortable as I became aware of how I had been affected.

It's been 75 days since. I remember how I felt about these two men. The love I held for them, and still do, yet for some reason cannot access. I can only observe it from the outside, aware that it's in there, but with no recourse to feel its curves or dimples. It's agonising, knowing you should feel one way, but simply don't. I'm starting to suspect I'm broken, and not in a cute way.

That thing is now the size of a door. An easy comparison, because as of yesterday, it had spread out to now seal the gap between door and wall, now altering my only option of escape to be an effortless 20 floor drop onto granite below. 

 Its still golden, still shimmering, still apeing a shallow monetary value that I started to suspect it didn't actually hold - originally, I was going to type that in the past few weeks, the only visible change apart from the growth was that it had donned a new physical trait. A beauty mark of sorts - a thin, black tendril that extended from its core outwards, zigzagging like crayon etched thunder on teams of A4.

That was what I was going to type, because while I was busy embellishing the details to make my exchange with Peter sound more witty and quick than it actually was, I heard something come from it. Just seconds ago, I approached it, looking for a source of audible emission.

I realise now, upon seeing what I saw, that all the world's chisels, pickaxes, swords, chainsaws and battery acid, could not leave a dent in that thing. So, immediately, I have two questions that you might be able to help answer;

1 - I touched it. Why didn't what happened to the Dimwit Duo happen to me?

And secondly, and quickly please, because frankly I'm fucking terrified now:

2 - How do I destroy this thing for good before the mouth I just spotted fully begins to form?
