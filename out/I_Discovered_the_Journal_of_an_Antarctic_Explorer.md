I’ve loved going to garage and estate sales since I was a kid. Every item being sold has a story connected to it and I love discovering what might be hiding behind people’s unwanted junk. From grandfather clocks to old military uniforms, to even a nearly mint condition Model T that someone’s relative had kept secret from the family. I’ve found hundreds of items like that, so when one day I came upon a small neighborhood garage sale that was going on. Without skipping a beat I pulled my car into this foreign neighborhood and quickly began searching around for items. 



I found the usual odd nicknacks that most people try to get rid of, clothes, old electronics, and the odd piece of furniture. I bought a few items here and there but nothing was standing out to me. That was until I came upon an elderly woman sitting in front of her house with a few items laid out before her. She smiled as I walked over to her and struck up a conversation with her, and began to show me a few items that she was selling. I probably don’t have to tell you, guys, how big of a jackpot old people are when it comes to interesting old items. 



She began to tell me how she was about to move into a nursing home and that she was having to give up a few items she wasn’t able to take with her. I nodded at her and began to peruse her items as we continued our conversation. She had plenty of interesting items from her family’s history. But one item especially caught my eye. A weathered old journal that was tightly tied up with a leather strap and with what looked like photos sticking out of it. I picked it up and examined it for a moment. 



I didn’t want to be rude and open it in front of her so I asked her about the book. She took it from me and did her best to try and look at it through her impressively thick glasses. But it looked just as foreign to her as it was to me. With this leather-wrapped mystery secured I gave the old woman who was named Margaret my number in case anything came from this journal. And with childlike giddiness, I quickly headed home to examine my find. 



The first thing I examined was a photo that greeted me the moment I opened the journal. It was a weathered old photo of five heavily jacketed men in what looked like a great white void. Flipping the photo over I was met with a strange inscription that confused me at first. 



Antarctic Expedition July 1930. 



Now I don’t claim to be an Antarctic expert, but I’d never heard of any expedition in the 1930s. A quick Google search did indeed show me that Admiral Richard E. Byrd did indeed have an expedition to Antarctica in 1930. But before I got my hopes up I noticed that no one in that photo resembled Byrd at all. In fact, the date on the photo was dated to a month after Byrd’s expedition had gone back home. 



I plucked another photo from the journal and found another copy of the five men. This one was labeled with the names of the men in the photo. Professor Albert Woodring, Niles Bergsvik, Olaf Hustad, Jesse Wallace, and Henry Perkins. With names now attached to these mystery explorers I started my search for them. But to my annoyance, I found nothing connected to these men, even the professor’s name revealed nothing to me. 



Thinking that maybe this was all just a hoax or some elaborate setup for some sort of story, I decided to crack open the journal and actually read it. It became apparent that the journal belonged to Henry Perkins and that he was a student at a university, though he neglected to ever name which one he was from. 



Much of the early journal is a set up toward the expedition to the Antarctic. Apparently, three Americans including the Professor and Henry would be accompanied by two Norwegians who were hired to ensure that the group didn’t get themselves killed in the sub-zero temperatures of Antarctica. They were taking a small team to get them to Antarctica and set up a base camp, from there the five men would travel over the Transantarctic Mountains and out onto the great vast emptiness of Antarctica. One early entry in the journal did draw my attention, however. 



March 17th, 1930: I spoke with Professor Woodring today about the finances regarding this expedition. This amount of equipment is sure to be costing both him and the university a small fortune. Not only is a team of sled dogs to accompany us and provisions to be supplied for up to three years on the continent, but even a radio and wireless telegraph machine is to be brought for the purpose of this expedition. I would venture to guess that this would rival even Admiral Byrd’s expedition. But the professor has kept tight-lipped about where all this money is coming from. He spoke only vaguely of a French Nobleman who is paying for most, if not all of our expenditures. 



Perkins seemed as skeptical as I was upon reading this. These things were expensive as hell during the time, especially during the great depression which even Perkins calls attention to in several entries. What was most alarming was the fact of how secret the professor was being about the expedition. He hadn’t even brought this up with anyone but the men who were to join him on this expedition. In all by the time to boat set off for Antarctica only 30 men had been chosen for the journey. 



This was all starting to feel like the beginning of a movie and my doubts were starting to grow. But I was enthralled by Perkin’s writing. Despite the strange and dubious circumstances surrounding this strange expedition, he was thrilled to be a part of it. His pages are filled with how happy he is to be away from university and out to mark his name into history. 



The boat was named *SS Firefly* and arrived off the coast of Antarctica after a smooth month of sailing. Perkin’s excitement was evident in his writing.



June 27th, 1930: At long last we’ve arrived at our destination! The great vast white land is before us and I’ve never been more excited. I’m about to walk where only a few brave men have walked before. The men are all giddy with excitement and I’m along with them. Though Professor Woodring seems slightly muted in his excitement. But I suppose a great war veteran would be hard to impress. 



With the group arriving at the continent, they began the task of unloading the *Firefly* and beginning to create their base camp near the base of Mt. Erebus which they named Atlas camp. I thought that was a little funny, the Titan that holds up the world. The rest of June and most of July was spent with the group of men continuing to build up the base camp of Atlas. All the while they began to deal with heavy windstorms and blizzard-like conditions. 



Perkins though seemed undaunted by it all and had even struck up a friendship with one of the Norwegian Niles. The two of them bonding over their shared passion for art. The two of them even exchanged sketches of each other which I found tucked away in one of the pages of the journal. Soon the base camp was at last completed and the men hunkered down waiting for the Antarctic winter to pass them by. I was surprised to find out from both this book and a quick Google to confirm that winter in Antarctica lasts from March to October. 



Perkins included several photos of the team living at the base camp and enjoying their company while they waited out the winter. From Perkins’ journal, it appeared that morale stayed high throughout the winter. They made sure the sled dogs were taken care of and Perkins and the other student Jesse Wallace helped Professor Woodring collect various samples and fossils that they had discovered in the construction of Atlas. 



It all seemed to be going quite well for the men. That was until a strange incident occurred just as winter was giving way to summer. I’ll let Perkins describe it for you. 



September 27th, 1930: The most peculiar incident has occurred that has left many of us stumped and confused. Last night while I was up late taking some notes on a trilobite fossil that Jesse had discovered I heard a loud and sickening crash on the roof of our cabin. The noise was so great that it woke almost everyone instantly. Olaf and Niles were quick to their feet and quickly grabbed their shotguns from the wall near their bed. I had to be on hand to stop anyone from going outside until dawn. For in these subzero temperatures and without any natural light we were liable to become lost in the storm that was at present attacking us. 



When morning at last came we all ventured out to see what the noise had been. None of us had gotten much sleep since the anticipation and the mystery had prevented any of us from falling asleep. Climbing up onto the roof we were met with a truly peculiar sight. A dead emperor penguin was waiting for us frozen stiff as a board on the roof. Embedded into its skin were several deep claw marks and even more puzzling was the fact that it looked like the penguin had been dropped from a great distance onto our roof. Almost like it had been in midflight before suddenly dropping dead on top of our cabin. 



Professor Woodring was just as puzzled as we were. He had no explanation for it, and we came up with several possible theories, though none of them were very convincing. Perhaps a great wind had picked up the injured penguin and dropped it on top of us. Or perhaps some great condor had been blown off course and had dropped its meal in an attempt to escape the biting cold of the continent. None of these theories are very concrete but it’s an absolute mystery as to how this flightless bird had somehow achieved flight. 



This puzzled me as well as there was no plausible way for the penguin to have ended up splatting on the top of Perkins’ cabin. Unfortunately, Perkins didn’t include a photo of the penguin so I had to take his word of the incident. However, the penguin incident was quickly forgotten once October dawned and at long last, Summer arrived on the continent. And our five heroes got ready to go out and explore what lay over the mountains. 



October 4th, 1930: At long last we set off from Atlas. With a cheer and wishes of good luck, we left on foot and skies with plenty of food and camping materials. The plan is to get over the mountains and build a temporary camp. Once the camp is built one of us university students and a Norwegian will be sent back to gather more supplies and hopefully more men to further build up a base camp across the mountains. Supplies will be sparse so it is hoped that we can complete our mission before the start of next winter. God willing everything will go well. I am hopeful and full of excitement. Our journey into the unknown begins at last. 



Their journey got off to a well enough start. However, hauling that many supplies over mountains proved to be harder than they were expecting it to be. And they barely managed to cover 3 miles a day over the mountain ranges. Several times they nearly lost a sled to the steep mountain edges. Perkins remained optimistic but even he was starting to question whether doing this had been a good idea when they had sled dogs available. But he comforted himself in thinking that they wouldn’t have had a much better time going over the mountains. 



It took most of the month but close to the end of October in joyful excitement Perkins declared, 



October 28th, 1930: At long last! We are past the mountains! I must confess that at times I felt like turning back and giving up this journey as lost. But as I lowered my goggles and face shield and looked out upon the great snow desert it felt as if it had all been worth it. Once we were some miles away from the mountains we began to set up our first semi-permanent camp. We haven’t bothered to name this one yet as we don’t plan on staying too long. This camp would act as a sort of supply dump for our return trip and for anyone who decided to go looking for us in case we went missing out here. I am overjoyed to be a part of this expedition and even Professor Woodring has been smiling at long last. I believe that we are in good hands out here. 



They stayed at this temporary camp until the first of November before continuing their trek out into the great white desert. As opposed to their slow going over the mountains they picked up speeds over the vast emptiness of Antarctica. One day they recorded going over 15 miles before making camp. Up till this point, I had been so preoccupied with the enjoyment of this reading that I had failed to ask myself what the point of this expedition was. They obviously weren’t heading for the South Pole as they had gone east from Mt Erebus over the mountain ranges and into an area near Victorialand. So what was the point of this trip? Perkins seemed confused as well when at last in a surprising turn of events Professor Woodring decided to make camp in the middle of nowhere some two hundred or so miles from their first camp past the mountain ranges. 



November 17th, 1930: Professor Woodring as triumphantly proclaimed our base to be named Kronos. I must confess that I was shocked when he ordered us to begin setting up our permanent base here, seemingly in the middle of this vast waste without any indication as to why. As Olaf and I were pitching our tent the Norwegian asked me what the point of this expedition even was. And to my surprise, I, myself, had no idea. I told him some vague answers about samples and fossils before quickly changing to subject to his family. 



Later once our mini tent city was set up, I pulled Jesse aside and asked him if he had any clue as to the origin of our expedition. And to my surprise and shock, he had been wondering if I knew the reason for it. That night we entered Professor Woodring’s tent and asked to be given the information to the meaning of this expedition. He looked at us for a moment or two before producing a letter from his trunk and handing it to us. 



It was a letter from the French Nobleman who had financed such an expensive expedition. One Henri LeBlanc, Count’d Vermandois. The letter instructed Professor Woodring to lead this expedition to Antarctica in search of signs of living creatures this deep into the interior. We both stared at him in absolute disbelief. There’s no way that anything could survive here in the interior of Antarctica. With these horrific temperatures and lack of a food source. Professor Woodring understands this and is with us in believing it. But who is he to turn down a stupid Frenchman’s money to finance a dream expedition?



I’m left conflicted. It is true that without this nobleman’s money, we wouldn’t now be here. But does he truly expect us to find anything out here? 



Perkins doesn’t write for the next few days which is surprising to me, as up to that point he had been consistently writing at least little updates for the days in which nothing happens. But for a solid week, he says nothing at all. But a week later his entry begins with the most ominous sentence I’ve ever read. 



November 24th, 1930: There’s something out there. (Perkins’ handwriting in this passage is notably much worse than it normally is). It started six days ago after we had just confronted Professor Woodring about the nature of this expedition. We were perplexed to find that there was a newly dug ditch in the snow. We were confused as none of us had dug it and it appeared as though something had emerged from under it. Grabbing shovels we began to dig it out and we were shocked to discover, several large objects buried in the snow. We picked a few of them up and examined them. They appeared to be large almost fossilized eggs. We believed that they may be dinosaur eggs of some kind, and thought for a moment that perhaps that crazy Frenchman had been correct. 



Our moment of happiness was very short-lived. That night while we were celebrating our discovery a sudden blizzard descended upon us. We were all confined to our heated tents to wait out the storm. It must have been close to midnight when through the howling wind I thought I heard someone screaming. I thought at first it was the wind, but in between gusts of wind I for sure heard blood-curdling screams. Acting quickly I threw on my jackets and mittens and grabbed my kerosine lamp from its post. Running outside in the whipping blizzard I struggled to see even a few inches from my face. 



Stumbling around in the darkness I stumbled upon Olaf’s tent and to my horror discovered it ripped to shreds. And there shivering uncontrollably and bleeding to death was Olaf. A look of absolute terror on his face. I quickly grabbed him and started screaming to the other members. They all quickly exited their tents and stared in horror at what was lying before them. Olaf looked almost as if he had been mauled but a bear and his tent, built to withstand blizzard-strength winds had been knocked over and ripped to shreds. We quickly dragged Olaf into my tent and began warming him up and treating his severe wounds. 



He began babbling in Norwegian and Niles did his best to comfort his fellow countryman. By some miracle, we managed to stop his bleeding and wrap his more serious wounds with gauze and bandages. 



I was completely taken aback by this. Just a few days ago the men had been in such high spirits. But now out of nowhere, something had attacked them. And as I turned the page I was greeted with photos of the aftermath. Olaf’s tent shredded and destroyed and almost completely buried in snow, and Olad himself, bandaged and placed in a sleeping bag to keep him warm and alive in Perkins’ tent. Perkins’ entry continued. 



Niles has taken to carrying his shotgun everywhere he goes, and I believe that to be a smart decision. We also decided to sleep two in a tent with Niles and me taking care of Olaf and Jesse and the Professor staying in their tent to make sense of what had attacked Olaf. He soon began to experience intense pain and we had to keep him injected with morphine to keep him from crying out in pain. We wracked our brains trying to imagine what had attacked him that night. But we didn’t have to wait long to figure it out. 



Yesterday, as I was getting ready to write in my journal again, Niles asked me to take a walk with him. I left Olaf in the care of Jesse while the Professor continued to examine the eggs that we had discovered. Walking with Niles he began to press me for more information on what our mission out here was. Feeling that he should know, I told him what the Professor had told me. Niles’ mind quickly went to the idea of some beast attacking the camp, but I couldn’t believe that. I clung to the belief that nothing could survive this deep into the continent. Penguins and seals lived only very close to the coast and there was no way that anything like that could survive here. 



As we continued to walk and discuss with each other, Niles took a step forward, and suddenly, in a blink of an eye, something emerged from beneath the snow and bit down on his leg with a loud and sickening crunch. Niles let out a scream and dropped his shotgun into the snow. He screamed and shouted in Norwegian as whatever was underneath the snow began pulling him down into it. In a blind panic, I quickly grabbed the shotgun from underneath the snow aimed it down into the snow, and fired. A horrifying screech bellowed out from the snow as suddenly something shot out from underneath it and covered me and Niles in rock-hard snow and ice. By the time we were able to get our bearing, whatever it was had disappeared. 



Perkins included photos of the nasty bites that Niles had gotten and the crater where the creature had seemingly been waiting for them. He also included sketches of the eggs which the Professor had told him could not be photographed yet. Perkins’ long entry ended with this haunting passage. 



There’s something out there, and it's hunting us. We need to get Olaf and Niles medical attention or they will die here. I plan on telling the professor tomorrow. And if he doesn’t agree I’ll have to convince Jesse to come with me. I’m not going to die here in this God-forsaken place. 



The next entry was dated two days later and was no less horrifying. 



November 26th, 1930: Professor Woodring is dead. I confronted him on the 25th as I said I would. I demanded that we be allowed to return to Atlas base with Olaf and Niles, otherwise they would die from gangrene, infection, or exposure. He refused, telling me that the eggs that we believed to be fossilized were in fact, living eggs. Despite this shocking discovery I was unmoved and demanded that we return to Atlas. Again I was ignored. 



I left his tent to inform Jesse of my plan. As I left the tent I heard a strange buzzing noise. Almost like that of a mosquito, only it continued to grow louder by the second until a loud crash sounded behind me from the professor's tent. Looking back in horror I was met by an enormous beast. It must have been nearly eight feet tall and walked on six spindly like legs. It was covered in a coat of white coarse fur and flashing its antennae at me. On its rear was a large stinger and attached to its body were two pairs of wings. 



It screeched loudly at me and was enough to draw Jesse out of his tent, shotgun in hand and a look of horror in his eyes. From underneath his destroyed tent, Professor Woodring cried out to us, begging for our help and ordering us to kill the creature. Jesse quickly aimed and fired at the creature. It let out some more screeches before it dug its legs into the tent and used its front legs to grab onto Professor Woodring and fly away with him, kicking up a torrent of snow and carrying the screaming and crying professor away into the ether. 



Included in the following pages were sketches that showed what the creature looked like. It appeared to be like a giant furry bug with a scorpion like stinger on it. And to my disgust, it had an almost human like face to it. Though one that was heavily insectoid nonetheless. Perkins’ entry continues.



Me and Jesse have decided to load Olaf and Niles onto our sleds and begin the journey back to Atlas. Kronos must be abandoned and whatever is out there must not be allowed to kill all of us. God willing we’ll be able to make it back safely. 



Perkins’ next few entries are not dated and they become increasingly hard to read. I’ve done my best to translate them here but know that some of I’ve had to guess as the quality has deteriorated. 



December (Illegible) 1930: The creature attacked us last night. Fought it off with a few shotgun shots. Olaf’s conditioning is worsening. Fading in and out of consciousness. A struggle to keep him warm. Niles’ leg recovered enough to continue walking on foot and help us pull sleds. We believe the creature is following us. 



December 4th or 5th, 1930: We made the painful decision to abandon Olaf. He has lapsed into unconsciousness and we believe that the scent of his blood is allowing the creature to track us. We left him behind and used the last of the morphine to further sedate him. I pray that it takes him when he is sleeping. We still have several hundred miles still to go till we reach the mountains. We hope that without Olaf we can make up time. 



December 7th or 8th 1930: This morning a dreadful blizzard attacked us. Jesse suggested we make camp, but Niles and I argued for continuing forward. Banking on the fact that perhaps the creature would lose track of us if we continued our march through the blizzard. Jesse wasn’t convinced but continued along anyway. By the time the storm at last died down, all of us were showing signs of frostbite, and Niles has begun to develop snow blindness.



December (Illegible) 1930: The creature hides itself under the snow. As we set up camp to continue on our journey, Jesse was leading the way as we continued to pull the sled, and as he stepped forward, the creature suddenly burst forth from underneath the snow and took ahold of his leg. Acting quickly, Niles raised his shotgun and blasted the creature in the face, sending it scurrying back under the snow. Unfortunately, it took Jesse’s foot with it. We bandaged it up as best we could and loaded him onto the sled, but I would be lying if I said I believed that he will make it. The creature almost seems to swim through the snow like some sort of snow nymph. 



(This next section had no date but I believe it to be a few days after this attack): Jesse has been crying and screaming for hours as we continue to march toward the mountains. Without any morphine to treat him, the only time he’s able to keep his mouth shut is when the pain becomes too much and he faints. Niles is not in any better condition. The bite marks on his legs have become infected and his strength is decreasing as the days continue. I’ve had to contend with the idea of continuing on my own, into the vast emptiness. To hopeful safety. 



January (Illegible) 1931: We reached the mountains at last. Unfortunately, the creature hasn’t stopped its relentless attacks on us. Just last night I had to use the last of the shotgun shells to drive it away. All I’m left with is my ice axe and a revolver that I salvaged from the Professor’s tent. It has four bullets in it. And me and Niles decided to put Jesse out of his misery. I couldn’t bring myself to do it, so I had Niles do it. We loaded what little food and gas we had left, and began our trek into the mountains. 



January 10th, 1931: Niles is dead. He went as far as he could but at last, the infection caught up with him and his snowblindness as well. I stayed with him through the night in our bivouac as he slowly drifted away. He told me stories of his childhood and his wife. Before at last his voice grew faint and he finally ceased to be. His last words were in Norwegian and unfortunately, I cannot repost them here. We started with five and now…I am alone. 



Along with this entry, there was a simple sketch of a grave that Perkins made for Niles out of his skies and equipment. The last few entries are barely coherent and point to the fact that at this point Henry Perkins was at his breaking point. At this point, he’d probably reached his breaking point long ago but it was finally catching up with him. His next few entries are not dated and are nearly impossible to read, but what few passages I could read I’ll relay here. 



-Creature attacked again. Stung with its stinger. Managed to hit with ice axe, cut off one of its antennae. Saving bullets. Pain is unbearable. Must keep going. 



-Creature uses antennae to sense when something is near. Saw them sticking out of snow. Managed to avoid it. I believe I’m lost. 



-Blizzard is upon me. Bivoucaed in place. Can hear it near me. 



-Blizzard continues. 



-Food has run out. Blizzard continues. 



(The next several pages are completely illegible) 



-Blizzard has let up. Can see camp from where I am. Can no longer move my legs. The creature is waiting outside. 



His final entry is heartbreaking, knowing how close he was to Atlas camp and just how far he’d made it by himself. 



-Fired several shots at the creature. It screamed, ran away. Left behind an egg. It's a female I believe. I wonder if anyone heard my shots. I believe I’ll rest a moment before trying to move my legs again. Just a small res- 



And with that, his entries end. And I’m left conflicted. I still have trouble finding this all believable. How did this journal end up in an old lady's garage sale if it sounded like Henry Perkins passed away just within sight of Atlas base? I contacted Margaret and told her about the contents of the journal. To my surprise and horror, she suddenly remembered something. Her great-grandfather had told her once of how he’d been a part of an Antarctic expedition. She invited me back to her house to examine a few of his items that she still possessed. 



True to her word she produced several photos of him from the expedition. It appeared that he had been one of the men to help build and maintain Atlas base while Perkins and the others went on their ill-fated journey. The two of us figured that after Perkins had fired those shots, her great-grandfather and a few men went to see where it had happened and came upon Perkins’ body. He then took the journal and returned to the States. 



So there’s no doubt about the validity of this story. To my surprise, while searching for any other connections to this story, I was put into contact with one Jackson LeBlanc, a descendant of Henri LeBlanc, who had financed the expedition. And he’s made it known how excited he is to buy this journal off of me, for whatever price I deem fit. 



I plan on meeting him in person tomorrow, and I’m sure he’ll be more than excited to see that his ancestor had indeed been right. Something was living in the Antarctic. Maybe there still is. But that’s the end of my story. I told you, you do find those nuggets of gold in garage sales after all.
