I'm writing this now so that people know what's happened to me, should my death be covered on the news. She won't stop. She's made that perfectly clear to me. I need to write this while I have the time.

I met this girl named Shayna back when we were in high school. We were both 17, and we fell for each other almost immediately. We got off pretty well, and just started as friends. Don't wanna jump the gun, ya know? We got each other's numbers after a couple weeks, and after we both graduated, I asked her out, and she did NOT hesitate to say yes. Our date was amazing. Took her to Applebee's, had some good food, then we went back to my house so we could end the night on a high note, if you catch my drift.

Years go by, and we move in together in an apartment. I think this is where the cracks started to show in her headspace. She started to get rather, for lack of a better term, erratic. Having random mood swings despite being infertile (something I learned before we moved in), asking me where I've been all day even when I tell her about it before I even walked out the door, and at one point, I swear I saw her outside my friend's house in the bushes. It was starting to weird me out, and I had asked her about it all, and she just went OFF on me, telling me to "stay out of her business". This wasn't our first fight. I could go on and on and on about the things she'd scream at me about; like for when I got a call from my mom and she thought I was cheating on her. Well, one thing led to another, and since the apartment was in MY name, I threw her out and called her parents to let them know. They were sad about how it ended, which I understood.

Well, Shayna did NOT take it well, and started harassing me about it for months until she broke in to try and make me talk. I had to call the police, and she was taken in for B&E (oh, and resisting arrest, as well). I had decided some time later to move out and get a house. Shayna got out on bail, and she started stalking me. It didn't matter how many times I moved away, she always found me. I even thought she tagged something of mine with one of those airtags Apple made. I didn't find any, thankfully, but I never did find out how she was doing it until I saw her following me in a car I assume she either rented or stole. Eventually, her hopes for us talking things out didn't work out so well, and her parents eventually gave up on her ever being normal again and pretty much sent her to a mental hospital. This...was when Shayna truly became the psycho I know today. It didn't take long for her to break out and exact her revenge. The first to die were her parents. The next one she came for? Me. She's tried multiple times to try and kill me, but she eventually got caught and arrested.

This made me file for a restraining order which was granted almost immediately, considering the evidence I had on her. Before she was taken to jail though, she had some last words for me: "That shit ain't gonna stop me, Evan!! You hear me?! I'll never stop until I fucking kill you!! IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU, THEN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE THE PIG YOU ARE!!!!!!!"

She ended up escaping from prison somehow (nobody knows to this day) and she ended up breaking into my home and lunging at me with a shiv she made before the cops were called again. She did get me good, though. Had to get some stitches, and I had decided to move to another state entirely, make my social media presence private, change my number, the whole nine yards. It was pure bliss for a while until I saw on the news that Shayna committed suicide in her padded cell. Her last words were read by her parents' lawyer: "Your head will roll, your blood will spill, and your heart will be mine. You ruined my life, so now you owe me yours. My spirit will never rest until you are dead at my feet. Evan, I swear to whatever holy entity exists in this wretched world that I will kill you. I will see you soon."

Dear merciful lord in Heaven, I thought, she's gone this far because I ended our relatioship? I didn't know how to feel, so I just changed the channel. That night, however...is when it began. Throughout the day, I would see her glaring at me, but is gone when I blink. I see her crazed grin in the mirror, but she's not there when I look. I would turn the corner and she would jump out at me, shiv in hand, and she would fade away as she'd start to stab at me. Nothing. It had to be my mind playing tricks on me, right? No. Whatever curse she put on me, it's started to work. I've tried telling people about what I've been going through; even my therapist, but nobody believes me. I try to gather evidence, but when I do, it's gone. Photographs I take are corrupted, video footage turns to static at the time it happens, and audio recordings I make of an incident is nothing but white noise. At first, I thouht that maybe my house was haunted by her spirit, so I hired a ghost hunting crew to take a look. They found nothing. I'd hire a spirit medium, and she said it was nothing and even chewed me out for wasting her time.

I am at a loss. I lost my job because of my lack of sleep, every relationship I start ends up failing on the first date because of her, and even my own FAMILY is starting to distance themselves from me. It truly does feel like I'm losing it...and then she finally materialized in front of me. Shayna. Her body is decayed, rotting, almost like a zombie. Her face twisted into a wide psychotic smile with wild eyes, and that damn shiv...it's been infused into her hand. She stood there, chuckling to herself. She seemed proud of herself, that smug bitch. I just looked at her and asked one simple question. "Why?"

Her answer? "I told you, Evan...you ruined my life...you made me go crazy...made me look like a total psycho bitch!!! So, I wanted you to know what it's like! I wanted you to feel my pain! I wanted you to feel what I felt when I got put in that hospital...and it's about to happen right...about...now." And the door went flying open at that very instant. I saw medics coming in and pointed to her, but they saw nothing. Before she faded, she gave me a mocking smirk and waved at me. She won. She fucking won. She drove me crazy...but I was NOT going down without a fight. I spent my time there at the mental hospital getting better and better by the day. She wants me to feel her pain? Well, I did, but it wasn't going to last as long as it did with her. Eventually, I was released on good behavior, and I even started writing a journal for my daily life, recording my recovery, and thankfully, I was finally better. I was a changed man...but only for a year and a half.

Shayna saw my recovery, and decided to take it upon herself to ruin it. I had a nightmare about her chasing me in a dark alley, her decaying body and sadistic insane grin, that shiv fused into her hand, and she was getting closer and closer. I found a weapon to use against her. A random broken pipe. Before she could hit me, I rammed it into her black heart, thinking I had finally putting an end to her insanity...but alas, it was just a dream. I told my wife about it, and we had a laugh. We spent the day together, watching TV, making out, and then we had dinner. It was nice, but then I noticed my wife coughing. I jokingly asked "Something go down the wrong pipe?", but she never responded. She just kept coughing. I got up to give her the heimlich maneuver, and what came out wasn't a piece of steak lodged in her throat...it was a glob of what looked like black sludge. At that point, she started vomiting more of it. I had tried to ask what was wrong, but she couldn't answer. Eventually...she began to change. Her body began to rapidly decay, her hair started falling out in patches, her mouth started to deform into a wide grin, and her eyes rolled into the back of her head. What's worse it her hand. It mutated into a fucking shiv. Shayna had possessed my fucking wife!

"YOU THOUGHT YOU FUCKING WON, DIDN'T YOU, ASSHOLE?!?!?!?!" she screamed. "YOU KNOW WHAT?!?!?! FUCK DRIVING YOU CRAZY!!!!! I'M JUST GONNA KILL YOU LIKE I SHOULD'VE DONE FORM THE START!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I managed to get out of the way and run out of the house. She gave chase, and had been on my tail ever since. I ran and ran as hard and fast as my bod could take me, and now here I am, writing this down in a run-down home in God knows where. It's only a matter of time before she finds me, which I know she will. She always did in life, and she always will, even in death...or UNdeath, I guess. If you find this post, please share my story. I know some people are going to say this is fake, but I know that this is the fucking truth because I God damn experienced it!!

I see her...and she sees me. She's coming for me. Thank you for reading...........and pray to whoever you worship for me...
