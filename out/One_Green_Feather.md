I don't like changing my routine. It makes me feel angsty. I just want a peaceful boring life.



I explain this to my older brother Jacob on the walk to school.



 He says “You must be getting autism like our neighbor Derry. You know one time I saw him bite his mom’s finger clean off. She gave him 3 cookies instead of 2 with his outside time.”



“You know he’s not autistic, right? You are born with autism it doesn't develop.” I defended.



“He seems pretty autistic to me. He was like ‘That's too many cookies!’ ” Jacob screams in laughter. 



FWEET. The assistant principal Mr.Robins blows his whistle to stop traffic. He stands in the middle of the road and stares at my brother.



“Jacob. Leave your Forest Gump impressions at home.” Mr.Robins states sternly.



Jacob stops laughing. He pulls a long strand of hair off his mullet and clenches it by his leg. He doesn't take his eyes off Mr.Robins.



Mr.Robins veers his eyes at me. “Good Morning Bell! Have a great school day and keep an eye on your brother. One more suspension and you’ll be walking home all by yourself.” Mr.Robins says gleefully.



I give a nervous chuckle and we all cross the road into the school grounds. My stomach Hurts. My stomach always hurts when I’m around Mr.Robins. I wonder if it’s the same for Jacob.





I'm so glad my high school is huge. I always get a table to myself. Girls are dramatic and boys always end up wanting more than friendship. I pull out my math homework for tomorrow and get a head start. 



THUMP a tall skinny guy crashes his food tray next to me. His glass of orange juice spills all over my work and pants.



“Derry, what are you doing here? You should be reading with Ms.Pulter.” I exclaim.



“She is sick today. Mr.Robins said to eat with you today.” Derry angrily states.



I look towards the exit and see Mr.Robins standing there. He waves at me. Derry sees this and calms down.



“Next time be more careful. My mom is not going to be happy that she has to leave work to bring me new pants” I said.



Derry takes out a green feather and quickly stabs my right leg. It leaves a small black hole in my pants.



“Ow!” I yell. My scream is muffled by the countless other tables yapping away.



“There” Derry mumbles.  



I look down. My pants aren’t wet anymore.



“Is that like an advanced Stain remover?” I ask.



“Do you see?” Derry asks.



“Huh?” I respond.



“It's a feather that can change the future” Derry responds in a clear and serious voice.



“Sure it does,” I say.



I clean the orange juice left on the table and take out another notebook to do homework on.



“Do you see?” Derry asks.



“Derry eat quietly please” I beg.



Derry looks at me and quietly eats his chicken nuggets.





Four hours later the bell rings. Schools over! Time to lay in bed and do nothing until the next day.



I go to my school’s entrance to start the 20-minute walk home with Jacob. I’m surprised he isn’t already waiting on me. Jacob is always punctual when it comes to leaving school. I call him but he doesn’t pick up the phone.



5 minutes go by and he still hasn't shown up. I start walking home. I decide to take a shortcut through the undeveloped land between my neighborhood and the school. 



I'm sure Jacob is running home by now trying to catch up to me.



I get a text from him. “I’m home. Hurry up!” it says. 



“Huh, how?” I reply.



I feel my pants getting wet. A liquid leaks from the black hole Derry made during lunch. I touch it and my fingers turn red.



“Blood?” I question. I sit on a dead tree stump. 



I lightly poke at the hole but I feel no pain.  I stuff my pointer finger in an attempt to stop the leak. The hole is deep and it widens. I keep pushing out of pure curiosity.



Two fingers, three fingers, four, five, they keep going deeper and deeper until my whole right hand is in my leg. 



I gag and hold my mouth shut with my left hand. The blood finally stops. I feel skin. I pat inside the hole when sharp claws grab my wrist.



“AH!” I scream. I try to pull my hand out but the beast has me tight.



 The beast hands me something and lets go of me.



I take my hand out of the hole and a bloody phone comes out. My brother’s phone… 



My body shakes. The size of the hole does not revert.  All I hear is distorted laughter coming from the dark abyss. 



Two black-red fingers with long sharp claws come out of the abyss with a red-soaked piece of paper. The fingers place a note on my leg. It says “ Come home”



I can't stop crying. I call the cops on my phone and run for help.



“911 what's your emergency?” the operator asks.



“Someone has broken into my house and they have my brother. Please send help” I plead.



A full scaly black-red arm comes out of the hole in my leg and caresses my crotch. I grab a hold of the arm but it's too strong for me to stop any of its movement. The hand returns to the hole.



“Maam what is your address?” the operator asks calmly.



“3345 Hi-”.



The arm returns with a rotten green stone dagger. It stabs me repeatedly in my stomach.



I fall to the ground.

My body feels like it's boiling. 

Darkness encapsulates the world.

All I can hear is echoes of uncanny laughter…



“Do you see?” Derry asks.



I open my eyes. I’m back in the cafeteria. A single teardrop crosses my cheek.



“I think I just died” I respond.



“Good, you can see,” Derry says. Derry stands up “Come to my house after school,” he orders as he walks out of the cafeteria passing Mr.Robins. 



Derry’s chicken nuggets are left behind.



I slowly text Jacob “Are you alive?”.



Jacob responds with “Obviously.” I smile. Tears fall down my face.



The rest of the school day goes as normal. I’ve been avoiding looking at my leg all day. I try to forget what happened. The traumatic event that took place just a few hours ago feels like a distant dream. 



The school Bell rings. Yay! School is over!



I go to my school’s entrance and see my brother waiting for me with Derry by his side.



“Bell! Guess who’s been trying to bite my fingers off all day?” Jacob jokes.



I run up and hug Jacob. “Shut up” I laugh. Jacob gets weirded out by my sudden signs of affection. He pushes me off.



“Okay okay, chill people already think I have a sister fetish. New rule. No hugging in school.” Jacob says.



I'm confused.



“Since when do I hug you?” I say.



“Wait what? You just did.” Jacob says.



“Oh yeah... Weird huh?” I respond.



“Bell can I talk to you in private?” Derry asks. 



“Later let's just get home I'm beat,” I reply. 



Derry grabs my arm tight. 



“Ow,” I say.



“Hey Let go of her!” Jacob grabs Derry’s wrist.



Mr.Robinson blows his whistle at us from the school parking lot. He looks angrier than usual.



Jacob and Derry let go. 



“Sorry sorry sorry” Derry exclaims as he slaps his head with each repetition.



“I’ll just stand over here. Please, Bell, it will just be a second.” Derry walks to a corner of the school building. 



I feel bad. Derry feels like my childhood friend after all; even though we are not. 



“Just give me a minute,” I tell Jacob.



“Okay, but don't get too close he seriously seems dangerous” Jacob responds.



I walk over to Derry. He is distressed.



“Bell you are repressing” Derry states.



“What?” I reply.



He fumbles around the inside of his backpack and takes out his green feather.



“Here let me stab you again,” Derry says.



I get very nauseous at the sight of the feather. I remember blood bursting out my wounds and my body being forcefully touched. A sinister tickling sensation spreads on my back.  



I vomit on the ground.



Derry moves in with the feather. I  put my hand up.



“No, No More!” I yell. 



Jacob runs towards us.



“Ok freako stay away from Bell,” Jacob says.



Derry hides the feather in his pocket.



 Jacob and I begin our walk home.



“Bell please try to remember. It's for your own good” Derry proclaims.





We are a couple of steps from our house now. I feel much better.



“What I tell you? Derry is crazy right?” Jacob asks.



“Yeah...” I reply.



Jacob opens the door and lets me through first.  I set my backpack on the ground.



THUMP 



Something heavy drops behind me. 



“This is not how it's supposed to go!” A distorted maniacal voice yells out. 



I look behind me and see a black and red patterned lizard-like demon. He has sharp rotten green teeth. Goo oozes out of his mouth and burns the floor beneath him.



His tail is meaty, covered in veins, with an opening at its tip.  



Jacob is on the ground. His face smashed in like a pumpkin after Halloween.



The demon picks up Jacob's head and tears fist fulls of hair off his scalp.



“No please stop” I cry.



“I made this world.” the demon says.



The demon throws Jacobs's head to the ground and repeatedly stomps on it. 



“I made it! It’s mine Mine Mine Mine!” The demon yells



Bits of flesh fly all over the place.



The demon leaps at me and pins me to the ground.



“It's him then you. Okay? Not together. Him then you. Answer me!” The demon growls.



I nod my head.



“Good” the demon responds.



His long tongue goes inside my shirt and worms its way around.



“Tomorrow you will be at the tree stump. No Changes!” The demon screams.



I try to get him off me. The harder I push the harder he holds me.



 He slaps my forehead with his hand and a green glow runs through me.



“Ok,” I respond.



The demon smells my neck and chest.



I want to forget.



I look at the wall by the stairs. There is a picture of my mom and dad holding a giant fish while Jacob and I make silly faces at the camera. I focus on that picture as the demon does his deeds. We were such a happy family.



I’ve reached momentary Bliss. I don't even know what's happening anymore.



Derry quietly comes down the stairs and steps in front of the picture. I can hear his voice in my head.



“Be courageous and strength will follow” Derry says as he holds up the green feather in front of him with both hands.



I feel strange. Like I’m visiting my religious grandma after getting a bunch of face tattoos but she hugs me despite it all.



“Remember,” Derry says.



I use the little freedom I have to look down. The demon is in every crevice of my body. Vomit comes up my throat. My eyes stay put.



The demon’s face becomes more human. Hair and skin grow on his scaly head. He looks up at me. It’s the vice principal, Mr. Robins.



The demon stabs me in the stomach with his stone knife. He laughs and butchers me as to say he has finished his meal. Darkness clouds my vision.



My fear, regret, sadness, and disgust, all turn to anger.



I walk to school with my brother Jacob. 



“You must be getting autism” he rambles on.



I walk onto the road. A car stops and beeps at me. The car tries to drive around me but I run in front of it. I take my backpack off.



 A middle-aged man gets out of the car.



“What the hell is your problem?” He says 



I put my arm in my backpack and point the backpack at the man. 



“Leave the car or I'll shoot!” I say.



“You don't have a gun,” the man says



“This is Texas! You really want to find out?” I yell



“Bell?!” Jacob yells. 



The middle-aged man steps back. I shoo him away as I walk to the car.



I'm in. I step on the accelerator and see Mr.Robins on the road directing traffic.



SPLASH



I hit him head-on. Green liquid flies all over the place. I reverse the car and make sure nothing but mush is left.



The world trembles. 



“Bell, What is going on!” Jacob screams.



I see Jacob running towards me.



“Jacob get in! We need to run.” I yell back



The sky turns red. The bystanders that fill up the world melt into bags of skin and blood.



“Bel-”, Jacob melts into the ground.



“Why is this happening to me?” I scream.



I step on the gas pedal.



Thunder clouds form in the sky. “This is my world! Mine Mine Mine!” the demon’s voice thunders down from the sky. The road behind me falls into a red nether.



Derry pops into the passenger seat out of thin air. “AH! “ I scream as the car swerves.



“We can finally go home!” Derry yells.



“Who are you and where in the fuck am I?!” I angrily shout.



“Right. I need to tell you who I am. Stupid Stupid Stupid” Derry says as he hits himself on the head.



The car breaks down into pieces of coagulated blood. Derry and I slip through the car and roll on the ground. The road is falling fast. I sprint on.



“Bell wait!” Derry yells. 



I pop out of existence.



Silence. It’s completely black. A spotlight shines from above creating a small circle of light around me. There is constant white noise in this place with sounds of moving centipedes sprinkled near my ear.



A hand covers my mouth.



“Ah!” I scream.



I look back and see Derry. The spotlight extends to encapsulate the both of us.



“Shh. Whisper. We are not alone. Sit down, we’ll talk quietly” He says.



I nod my head. Derry lets go and we both sit down.



“You got lucky. Don’t blindly hop between realms. You could have easily slipped through a crack and gone all the way down” Derry laughs quietly. I can feel that he is overcome with Joy. 



“Who are you?” I ask.



“I am your guardian angel” Derry replies. 



A pair of vast white wings appear from Derry’s Back. They are beautiful… but they are burning. There are multiple holes carved into its pure feathers.



“That lizard Demon trapped your soul. I’ve been trying for centuries to break his hold over you, but Angels cannot directly save those who do push through adversity.” Derry explains.



“I thought there was nothing after death.  When Mr.Robins got to me I just wanted to forget and disappear. I’m sorry…” I reply.



“No. I’m sorry. It’s my fault you are down here. Any other angel would have never let this happen. But I… when I saw how you died…I… I questioned my faith..” Derry somberly replies.



Derry puts his hand on my shoulder and smiles.



“Let us have faith together” Derry whispers.



The warmth in his voice brings me comfort. I smile. I feel like I haven’t had a genuine smile in a long time.



Another spotlight appears in the middle of the room. It shines on a clown pop-up box. A clown pops out of the box smiling. It has a little bell attached to its right hand.



The clown tilts its body to the side and waves at us. 



DING DING DING



“A devil has found us. We need to get going.” Derry states. He stands and pulls me up.



“Where to?” I ask.



 The clown slowly hops towards us. His bell dings with every hop.



“Up. Jacob will be happy to see you.” Derry says.



Derry grabs my hand and flaps his battered wings. He struggles to rise even a little off the ground.



DING



“Are you sure you can do this?” I ask.



“Yes. Let us have faith.” He responds. Derry takes 3 deep breaths and tries to fly again.



We are flying! It feels like I'm deep underwater and I'm floating up for some fresh air.



I look down to see the clown looking at us.



The clown has a huge twisted smile on its face.



Another spotlight appears in the distance. It’s Mr.Robins.



“Where is she?!” he yells.



The clown points up and rings its bell.



“See you soon!” The Clown says innocently.



 Mr.Robins looks up at us. 



POP



We collapse on beige carpet. I look up to see a long hallway. The walls are lined up with doors. It looks like we are at a luxury hotel.



Derry is hyperventilating on the ground. His wings completely burn off.  



I turn him over on his back. He goes quiet.



“Hey come on, we can make it out together. Let's have faith. Wow, it sounds super cheesy when I say it” I say. 



Derry smiles.



“But, I’m serious,” I say.



“Feather…” Derry responds.



I search his khaki pants and find the green feather.



Derry whispers “Stab”.



I stab Derry in the chest with the feather.



Derry’s body sucks in the feather and a golden flow emanates from the hole throughout his body.



Derry gasps for air. One brand new angel wing burst out his back.



“Are you okay?” I ask.



“Yes yes I’m … good,” Derry says. 



Derry stands up.



“Can we still fly out of here? I ask.



Derry slaps the side of his head repeatedly. 



“Maybe” he snaps.



“Okay,” I say.



Black ash slowly appears near the edges of his new wing.



We walk forward and stop at room 777. Derry opens the door and we walk inside to find an empty Bar. 



The bar is fitted with wood furnishings and red with gold patterned carpet. It looks elegant.



A humanoid white Goat in a red suit cleans glass cups behind the counter.



“You’re back.” the goat says.



We walk into the bar and close the door behind us. The door merges with the wall and disappears.



“I need another seraphin wing. Just one more and we can make it out,” Derry says.



“Baa” the goat bleats as he nods his head sideways.



“Derry I want to help you I do, but it's not like I can produce anymore. Have a seat and accept your fate just like I did.” The goat responds.



Derry takes a seat by the bar. The goat pours him a vodka tonic.  I sit down at a nearby table.



“And you girl. I can barely smell any sense of faith in you at all. God won't accept you, return to your demon before that buffoon destroys my bar.” the goat says.



“What is Faith anyways?” I ask.



The goat laughs so hard that the bar shakes. Bottles of liquor fall off the shelf.



Derry crosses his arms on the counter and lowers his forehead.



“Faith is believing in God without knowing if god exists. It is the belief that you will be saved without you knowing for a fact that you will. That is faith.” the goat responds.



The Goat walks over to my table and takes a seat.



“For some of us who know that god is real. Who knows he is all-powerful and can save anyone. Faith is very hard to cultivate. How can we have faith if we know it's a fact?” the goat says.



The goat clenches his fist and rants.



“It’s a fact he can save everyone but he doesn't immediately do it. The more we wait for ‘the fact’ to act the less we believe he will.” The goat punches straight through the table.



“The fact becomes a question and the question becomes doubt. Doubt leads to loss of faith!” The goat summons a bottle of whiskey and slurps down the hole thing. 



The table repairs itself. The goat slams the bottle on the table.



I hear a sniffle. I look towards Derry and see a tear drop fall from the counter onto the red carpet underneath him.



I walk over to Derry and put my hand on his shoulder.



“I don't know how but I will get enough faith for the both of us. I am getting out of here and I’m not leaving you behind.” I say.



Derry looks up at me crying. There is a set of little red horns coming out of his forehead. 



“Let us have faith,” Derry says.



A set of reddish-black claws peirce through the bar’s walls.



The goat sighs. 



“If you are going to keep trying then you better get moving.” the goat says. 



He snaps his fingers and a door appears.



“Go through there. It will take you to the stairway to heaven.” the goat says.



Derry stands up and walks towards the door.



“Thank you for everything Samael” Derry replies.



The goat gives us the middle finger.



Derry and I walk through the door. The door disappears behind us.



We are in what appears to be a dark elegant mansion with a checkerboard ceramic floor.

The only light in the room comes from a huge endless set of stairs in front of us.



There is a gold light that emanates from the top of the stairs.



“We will make it out,” I say.



Derry nods in agreement.



We go up one step. A bright smile comes out of Derry’s face. 



Two steps, 3 steps. We go up 7 steps. 



“We are halfway there!” Derry says.



“Oh oh, We’re living on a prayer!” I chuckle.



On step 8 we hit an invisible wall. Derry pushes against the force with his hands.



“I guess that's it,” Derry says.



“I'm sure it will open up, we just have to believe. Trust in god or whatever.” I say.



We sit down with our backs against the invisible wall.



DING DING DING



A pop-up clown box hops in from the shadows at the bottom of the stairs. The clown explodes out of its box.



“Hi Friends!” the clown burst into laughter.



The Clown knocks on the invisible wall that blocks his passage onto the first step of the stairway. 



“What are y’all doing all the way up there? Come down here. Let's play.” The Clown says.



“Leave Devil, you will never touch us while we stand under the light of god,” Derry says.



“The light of god that allowed that poor little soul and her brother to get raped and killed?” The clown giggles.



I grab my stomach tight. The invisible wall behind Derry and I pushes us one step lower.



We sit on step 6 now.



“I know we’ll be saved!” I scream. 



I grab Derry’s hand tightly. His fingers grow claws. He lets go of my hand.



Derry looks at his hands and cries.



“I mean I don't know, but I believe. Everything happens for a reason right? It has to.” I say.



We are pushed to step 5.



“Listen girly. I'm your salvation. Let's make a deal” The clown says as he extends his hand.



Derry stands up; his skin is red and his angel wing is halfway burned.



“Speak,” Derry says.



We are pushed down to step 4. I spread my arms against the invisible wall.



“The deal is simple. I will turn back the clock and give you the chance to save this little girl before her demise. In return your soul belongs to me.” The Clown says.



“Deal,” Derry says.



The invisible force pushes Derry out of the staircase.  The clown grows bigger to match Derry’s size.



Derry smiles at me as he shakes hands with the Devil.



“Derry Wait!” I yell.



POP



The clown and Derry pop out of existence.



A long veiny tail slithers out of the darkness. It spits green acid that burns through the tile.



“I’ve finally caught up to my favorite student.” The demon says.



The invisible force pushes me down to the very first step.



I turn to face the invisible wall and get on my knees.



I close my eyes and put my hands in a praying position.



I can feel the Demon’s breath on my neck.



“Come to me my darling. Let's have fun for eternity.” He says.



I’ve never prayed in my life but I ask for salvation with all my might.



I ask for forgiveness. I tell god I trust his will and no matter what happens I will not forget or belittle the challenges I was given. I ask for strength.



I feel my body being pushed back. The demon's tail wraps around my stomach.



I do not budge my stance. God believes I can overcome this so I will overcome this. 



A bright yellow light shines shines through my eyelids. I hear my brother's laugh.



I open my eyes and I’m back on the sidewalk walking to school. I look to my right and see Derry.



“Can you please tell your brother to stop calling me autistic?” Derry says to me.



“Derry!” I respond. 



Someone runs behind me. They wrap their arms around me and Derry.



“Hey, you bozoes. Stop walking so darn fast.” Jacobs states.



I look toward the school entrance. Mr.Robins is directing traffic. I stand still.



A gush of wind blows my eyes shut. I open my eyes and see a green feather following the wind in the sky. I get a bittersweet smile.



“I’ll meet you guys there my mom is calling!” I tell Jacob and Derry.



I take my phone out and dial 911.
