Today and tomorrow and next have all conjoined into one lung. Last month slithered into half a liver.

My dreams have gotten out of hand.

I’ve always had sleep issues. As a kid, I would sleepwalk nearly every night—

around the house, rearranging my toys, standing in corners, mumbling nonsense.

Then one night, I woke up outside.

Feet wet. Hands cold. Eyes already open.

I was standing in the middle of a parking lot.

Right outside a Dollar General.

I remembered nothing of the dream I’d been having, or why I’d walked three miles to that specific place.

All I know is I was holding a piece of paper.

UNUSUAL NIGHTMARES? STRANGE OCCURRENCES AROUND THE HOUSE?

MADAM ZEPHERINE HAS THE ANSWERS.



That’s usually where the memory ends.

Where I realize I’m outside.

That I’m lost.

That I start to cry.

But my parents insist it never happened.

That I imagined it.

“You’ve always had such a vivid imagination, you know.”

I believed them. For a while.

That’s right around the time the nightmare began—

the invasive one.

The one that stole years of sleep from me.

I’ll try to re-tell it the best I can.

But some of the details are always a little foggy.



It’s always dusk.

There’s always a city skyline.

I’m always barefoot.

The sky bleeds deep red, the sun oozing over the buildings like syrup over rust.

My feet are sore. My socks are worn out.

I’m six or seven—the same age I was when I woke up outside.

A voice in my head says:

*Nearly there. Just a little further and all will be right as rain.*

I cry. I miss someone.

My mom? My dad? A pet?

It always changes.

Through sobs, I manage to ask:

Why did you take them?

They’ll be there tomorrow. But only if you can be brave.

A metallic sound echoes through the silent evening.

The hiss of a sliding door.

I’m standing in front of a nondescript, symmetrical Dollar General.

The parking lot is empty.

The lights are off.

But the door opens.

Hot, putrid air spills out, and I cry harder.

*It’s hungry. You have to feed it. Then it will give them back.*

I walk inside.

The door slams behind me.

Everything goes dark.



Then I wake up.



This is where my troubles began.

It’s hard to notice at first. But once you do, you can’t unsee it.

A few months ago, I started writing a daily journal—just to organize my thoughts.

Try to feel a little more grounded.

Instead, I captured my descent.

The rituals are real.

The rites must be fulfilled.

Madam Zepherine insisted that I burn all my old journals and forget.

But I choose to remember.

Here is a recounting from the beginning.



—

It’s been four months since I moved to the city.

I feel lighter now.

No overbearing parents breathing down my neck about “settling down.”

No more hour-long drives just to reach a grocery store.

And best of all: no more endless fields of row crops stretching into nothing.



I feel like somebody now. I have my own friends. My own job. My own life.

Still in the honeymoon phase, everything’s exciting, everything’s new.

New food, new places, new faces.

The day I left, my parents stood waving from the screen porch, their eyes puffy and red from crying.

It was only an eight-hour drive, but to them, it may as well have been an ocean.

They had always pictured me settling down with a local boy, buying a white-picket house across the street, coming home every Sunday for dinner.

Instead, I left for college, partied too much, and graduated four years later with a degree in marketing.

I did feel bad. That town had been home my whole life.

My family was there. My childhood friends. Everything pointed to staying.

After all, the city’s dirty. It’s violent. There’s traffic.

Everyone said so.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I didn’t belong. That the town was shrinking around me.

It always felt... claustrophobic. Like I was meant for somewhere else.

As I drove down that long, desolate stretch of highway that separated my house from the rest of the world,

I let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding.

And I felt that weight lift like something had finally released its grip on my chest.

—

My apartment was small.

Only 900 square feet.

I had no furniture when I left my parents, so I made do with an inflatable mattress and a few empty moving boxes as makeshift nightstands. Very functional.

It felt almost blasphemous moving in. Everything was so pristine, so new, that faint scent of drywall dust and fresh paint. And the view. I’d never seen so many buildings stacked together like that. The city felt enormous.

So much life.

Every window lit, every light bleeding into the next, creating a strange uniformity to the chaos.

Over the next few months, I slowly filled the space.

The couch I picked out was beige. More of a loveseat, but it would do. I felt bad making the movers haul it up the narrow stairs, but there was no way I was doing it myself.

Next came a small walnut coffee table, circular, with three tapered legs and a shallow groove around the edge. I liked the grain in the wood. It reminded me of a topographic map, the kind they used to have at the county visitor center.

I bought two matching lamps from a secondhand store. One worked, the other only flickered if you turned the bulb just right. I kept it anyway.

The walls were bare for a while until I found three small black-and-white prints at a thrift market, trees reflected in still water, each one labeled in a language I couldn’t quite place. I liked the symmetry.

They felt calming. Balanced.

I hung them evenly spaced above the couch.

I kept my books on stacked milk crates against the wall.

Half architecture textbooks, half novels I hadn’t opened since college.

One of them, I swear, had a dog-eared page I didn’t remember marking.

A line underlined in pencil:

“We live above what we cannot bear to remember.”

I didn’t think much of it at the time.

The rug was the last thing. Woven, warm.

Burnt orange with a pale cream border, slightly frayed at the corners.

It made the place feel like mine.

Trivia night has to be my favorite day of the week.

Work is fine, but I live for recounting useless facts.

The Green Goose Pub was a few blocks down from my apartment. Usually, I rode with Xavier — one of the few people I knew in the city with a car.

Tonight I decided to walk.



The fresh air felt good after being cooped up in the office all week.

My building was in the financial district — the only part of the city that completely flatlined after 5 PM.



They’d thought of everything: a Starbucks on every corner, an overpriced French bistro with an ampersand in its name, and enough banks and fintech shells to make you feel like money could think for itself.

One of them was my beloved employer: Pocket Blade.

An app that helps you navigate the city — walking, driving, biking — always calculating the most efficient route.

From humble origins (a group of former MIT grads coding in a condemned bowling alley), it had grown into one of the city’s “essential tools.” That’s what the ads said, anyway.

Our mission statement was something like “Cut through the chaos.”

I always found that funny, considering how much chaos we contributed to.

Now the office stood like the rest — backlit and silent, glowing slightly behind fingerprint-resistant glass.

The sidewalks were empty.

The crosswalks changed on schedule, even with no one there to cross.

Even the pigeons were gone.

My phone vibrated softly in my pocket. 

It was Vera.

“What the fuck do you want?”

“Where are you? Happy hour’s ending and everyone’s already two drinks in.”

I glanced at my watch. 6:45.

“Shit. I thought I could walk — forgot how far it actually is.”

I’d put the bar into my Pocket Blade app. It said forty-five minutes.

Weird. It was usually half that.

I must’ve groaned, because she didn’t let up.

“Listen, you need to get here. Xavier just showed up and you’re the only one who can cancel out his... energy.”

“How dare you. I’m the only one allowed to bully him.”

“Oh my god. Here he is.”

There was a brief burst of background noise — voices, clinking glasses, someone yelling something about team names. Then static as the phone shifted.

“What’s this I hear about weird antics?” Xavier said.

I laughed.

“Just glad you're self-aware about it.”

“Where are you? Trivia doesn’t start until the country bumpkin arrives. I thought you were supposed to show us how to make whiskey in a bathtub?”

“It's called moonshine, actually. Respect the craft.”

“Call yourself a rideshare and get over here. You’re not walking in this city unless you’re trying to end up in an unsolved Netflix doc.”

On the other end, I heard a burst of cheering, maybe someone banging on a table.

“What was that?”

“The ghost of John Lennon just floated in and took three shots!”

Then he hung up, the silence of the city rushed to fill the life on the other end of the line. 

So weird not hearing birds or cicadas every night. Probably the one thing I miss most.

I pulled out my phone and ordered an Uber. Would only be three minutes till he arrived.

 — 

A heavy grey blanket rose in the distance, not clouds, not rain, just a thick sludge that blotted out the neutral oranges and blues of the setting sun. The stark contrast snapped me out of my dissociation.



I’d driven down this road thousands of times, but it felt like I was seeing it for the first time.

I guess riding in an Uber will do that to you.



I started noticing things:

The A/C blowing cold air directly into my eyes.

The dull headache building behind my temples.

The woman driving, her window cracked halfway down, a line of chipped red polish on her nails, a fracture blooming across her windshield like a vein.

Then I saw it.

Just off the road, between three houses and four distinct big red bold letters.

My heart skipped. My eyes widened.

It had been here the whole time.

How had I never seen it before?

Screeching tires.

The driver’s scream cut through the air.

I looked up just in time to see the windshield explode.

For a second, the air was warm, not the choking heat of panic, but something soft.

I felt my hands resting neatly on my lap.

I exhaled.

Then the glass came.

Fragments and metal screaming in a tangled roar.

My body snapped sideways, shoulder crunching, arm folded beneath me.

Blood spattered across the fabric in sharp, rhythmic bursts.

A starburst of pain as something slammed against my face.

I inhaled sharply.

My vision blurred. My eyelids fluttered.

Darkness pulled at the edges of my sight.

And just before it took me,

I saw a billboard.

STRANGE DREAMS?

COME SEE MADAM ZEPHERINE.

—

I awoke sometime later, my headache now a relentless pulse, worsened by the sharp tang of stale ammonia and latex.

The air was thick and artificial, like breathing through a plastic bag.

I pushed myself upright in the dense hospital bed. My body ached everywhere, but my arm pulsed with a separate, sharper pain.

The door was slightly ajar. Out in the hallway, wheeled carts creaked past, and somewhere farther down, a cough broke through the low murmur of machines. Monitors beeped out their flat, impersonal rhythms.

I sat there a moment, disoriented, fingers clutching at the blanket. Then I remembered:

Vera. Xavier.

They must be worried sick.

I reached for my phone.

It wasn’t there.

I shifted my legs over the side of the bed and stood, not easily. My knees buckled, and I caught myself against the IV pole. I clung to it like a lifeline, letting it carry part of my weight.

The hallway lights were painfully bright, humming overhead in sync with the pounding in my skull. I stepped out, wincing, limping. The drugs were wearing off. Everything hurt.

The corridor stretched ahead, still and sterile.

And at the far end, silhouetted against the window, someone stood.

I squinted, taking slow, careful steps forward. My right arm was curled protectively against my chest, the cast too heavy, too tight. As I got closer, the shape resolved — a nurse, I thought.

He stood slouched in front of the glass, backlit by the flicker of parking lot lights. His scrubs hung loose on his frame, the top wrinkled and slightly damp at the collar. A ruffled patch of bleached, unkempt hair curled around his ears. His gold earrings caught the light like small coins.

His name tag said: Steven.

He didn’t seem to notice me until I pressed a hand to the window beside him, my cast thudding softly against the glass.

He turned.

“Oh my God, you’re awake!” he said, startled. His voice was too cheerful. Thin, like someone trying to sound normal in a nightmare.

I didn’t answer right away. The grey sludge I’d seen before the crash was gone — wiped from the sky like it had never been there.

But the same sense of disconnection lingered.

Like a TV tuned to the wrong channel, faint static humming beneath the clean hospital white.

“I think I might be dreaming,” I murmured.

Steven chuckled awkwardly. “Let’s get you back, alright?”

He guided me gently by the elbow, steering me down the hallway and back into my room. I must’ve winced when I sat, because moments later he reappeared with two small pills in a paper cup and a plastic pitcher of water.

“See if these help.”

I took them without hesitation, swallowing both in a single gulp.

He hovered at the foot of the bed, fidgeting with my IV.

“Do you ever get déjà vu?” I asked, voice low.

It sounded stupid as soon as I said it. But he didn’t flinch.

“Once, when I was eleven,” he said. “There was this school trip. I’d been dreaming for weeks about dinosaur skulls, running through tunnels, hiding from something in the dark. I think I saw the skull in a textbook or something. Didn’t think anything of it.”

He paused, one hand resting lightly on the top rail of my bed.

“Then I went on the trip. Museum out in Hartford. We were walking through the fossil hall, and… from the shadows, there it was. The exact skull. Snarling, just like in the dream.”

I stared at him, unsure if it was the drugs or the concussion keeping me quiet.

“I was terrified,” he said. “But then something strange happened.”

I leaned forward.

“…Yeah?”

He moved closer, slow, deliberate.

Bent at the waist until his mouth was level with my ear.

“It spoke to me,” he whispered.

Then, with a deafening crack, his jaw snapped open.



The noise didn’t sound human. It echoed like breaking bones. His lips peeled back, mouth agape, revealing a second set of teeth curling along the roof of his mouth. Yellow, animal, too many for the size of his skull.

His breath was hot. Close.

“Madam Zepherine wishes to speak with you.”

As he bore down on me, swallowing my entire body in one bite.



I woke in a cold sweat, choking down water in the dark.

My throat burned. My arm throbbed inside its cast.

I clutched the bedsheet with my good hand, eyes darting across the room.



The hospital was gone.



So was Steven.



Who the hell was Madam Zepherine?
