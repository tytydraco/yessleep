I’m a big Nintendo fan so when Nintendo Switch 2 was announced I was very excited. Many people are complaining about the price, however, I believe that it is quite fair for the countless hours of entertainment it will provide me over many years. So for this reason I preordered it so I could play it day 1. Looking back, I wish I had not done that. 

Yesterday my Nintendo Switch 2 arrived. “Odd” I thought because the system doesn’t launch until June. Scratched onto the box in pen was messy writing that looked like Japanese. Excitement overcame me and I didn’t bother to take the time to translate. That could have saved me a great deal of hardship in hindsight. Instead of translating I ripped open my system assuming that I was a special boy to receive my preorder early but I would find out it’s not always good to be special. 

I got a regular Nintendo switch with no game bundle. I figured I would play GameCube games I always wanted to play using the new GameCube functionality they added to NSO +expansion pack as well as upgraded backwards compatible games from my Nintendo Switch library that had free upgrade packs included with the new and improved NSO +expansion pack. If only I had taken Nintendo up on their generous deal for Mario Kart World bundle console instead, then I wouldn’t be in my current situation. Being that I had no game bundle, imagine my surprise when an unmarked game cartridge fell out of the box when I removed the system. 

Curiosity got the better of me and I inserted the cartridge into my system believing I got a freebie. Upon insertion I saw that the game was 100 GB which startled me. However, that was no issue. With the Nintendo Switch 2’s 256 GB storage and faster download speeds I was ready to play shortly. I wish the Nintendo Switch 2 had less storage and slower download speed looking back so I could’ve kept living my normal life. The game had no icon on the Switch 2 menu. “Is this normal?” I thought to myself. I wish I had bought the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Expirience to learn more about my new system. If I had, I would’ve known that this game I was playing was not normal. 

When I booted up the game I just saw Super Mario bros 3 but with a creepy off key version of the title theme coming from all around from the Nintendo Switch 2’s crisp 3D spatial sound. I was off put immediately but I couldn’t stop myself from clicking play. I was put straight into a Mario level unlike any Mario level I ever played. Mario looked real and the world was Mario’s world but the real world. I noticed that it looked like my hometown that Mario was in rather than World 1. Then the system ejected from its dock. I should’ve stopped playing there but I couldn’t. I had to know more about this game. So I grabbed the console from its dock and continued in handheld mode and to my horror Nintendo Switch 2’s 7.9 inch LCD display made the game look as sickeningly realistic as it did on my 4k tv. I began playing through the level and realistic Mario began making his way through town and I saw many people and businesses I recognized. It was surreal but I kept playing despite my sense of dread. The system began to get very hot so I needed to put it down. Luckily, the Nintendo Switch 2 had 3 modes of play so I propped it up with its built in stand and used the new mouse functionality to continue playing. I wish there were only 2 modes of play because then I would’ve stopped playing. 

With the mouse functionality I made it to the end of the level and jumped on the flagpole in classic Mario style. But, instead of a castle at the end it was my house. My blood ran cold and by instinct I pressed the new “C” button and opened Nintendo Switch 2’s game chat functionality. There I saw a crisp image of a man with distorted proportions that looked like the Mario I was playing in the game and on his camera it was revealed he was outside my house just like Mario. “It’s-a me Mario he said clearly through the Nintendo Switch 2 microphone he was holding and he kicked down my door. I quickly ran to the bathroom taking my Switch 2 with me. I hid in there while Mario jumped on all my stuff saying “Where are you Justyn”. Thinking fast I jumped out of my window and ran to my local 7 eleven where I’m writing this account. 

I’m hiding in the bathroom and through the crack in the stall I see that a man with a green hat and overalls just entered. I’ll update if I survive this encounter…
