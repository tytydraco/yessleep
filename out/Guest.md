There were five of us, yes, exactly five—me, my neighbor Diana, our friend Alina, her boyfriend, and our friend Max. But how? When?

Diana and I decided to invite our friends over for dinner. Max arrived first, then Alina and her boyfriend showed up. Later, as I was setting the table, someone knocked on the door. We weren’t expecting anyone else, and when I opened it, no one was there. "Probably just my imagination," I thought. I continued setting the table but noticed there weren’t enough plates for everyone. I was sure I’d put out five, but I must have miscounted. I brought another and we sat down to eat.

We’ve all known each other for a long time and usually get along well, but something felt off that night. There was an uneasy atmosphere around the table, and I could see discomfort on everyone’s faces, as if there was a stranger among us. We finished dinner in silence and decided to break the tension by playing cards. The loser would wash the dishes. We played the classic "Durak" game—six cards each—but after dealing, there were no cards left for the deck or trump card. We barely spoke, unable to shake the strange feeling.

Alina and I lost, so we went to wash the dishes, and Diana joined us.

Me: "Girls, don’t you feel like there’s someone ‘extra’ among us?"

Alina: "Yeah, something’s making me uncomfor—"

Diana: "What the hell is going on? Who is he?! Who’s that person?"

Me: "Who are you talking about, Di?"

Diana: "I... I don’t know. He’s with the guys. I feel sick."

Me: "Calm down, no one else was here… right?"

Just then, a strange sound came from outside the window. Being from the village, I recognized it—it was like the final scream of an animal having its throat cut, a horrifying, gut-wrenching cry.

Alina’s boyfriend ran in when he heard our shouts.

Him: "What’s going on? What happened?"

Alina: "There’s something outside. We heard a strange scream."

Me: "Where’s Max?"

Him: "He said he was going out for a smoke about five minutes ago and hasn’t come back."

Diana: "Is he okay? We need to call him."

Alina and her boyfriend went outside to look for Max, but he didn’t respond. We called his phone, but the sound came from the room we had just been in. He’d left it behind.

"This has to be a joke, right? Max is pranking us."

Diana started feeling worse, so I tried to comfort her even though I was terrified myself. Alina and her boyfriend returned, shaking their heads, saying they couldn’t find him.

Alina: "If this is some kind of prank, I’m going to kill Max, I swear."

Him: "We’re going to head home. It’s still early. Thanks for having us, though. Too bad we couldn’t hang out like usual. Maybe you can come to our place tomorrow?"

Alina: "Yeah, I’ll bake something for tea… and poison Max’s."

Me: "Alright, it’s a shame things turned out like this. See you tomorrow."

After Alina’s joking threat, the atmosphere lightened a little. They left, and Diana and I were alone.

Diana: "I’m scared. We should’ve asked them to stay over."

Me: "Where would we all sleep in one room? And can you imagine sleeping next to the guys?"

Diana: "I’d rather do that than tremble in fear here, just the two of us."

Me: "Don’t worry, we’ll sleep next to each other tonight, okay?"

Diana: "Yeah, okay."

Even though it was early, we made the bed to go to sleep sooner. We lay down together and turned off the lights.

I was scrolling through my phone when Diana suddenly had to use the bathroom. As soon as she left, I heard that horrible scream again, but this time, there were two of them. The same unsettling feeling from dinner crept back. I heard the bathroom door fling open, and someone jumped into bed behind me.

Me: "Did I scare you?"

Another second passed, and then the scream again...

I don’t know who is lying next to me
