It was October 2013 when I first arrived in Irkutsk. The cold had already settled in, and the sky always seemed overcast, like the sun had forgotten this part of the world. I had just moved in, trying to get away from the stale routine of old assignments. I'm  just a journalist, moderately experienced, but always restless. I’ve never minded long hours or chasing stories most people ignore. That’s just how I am. I suppose you could say I’m a bit of an ergophile.

The city was quiet, too quiet maybe. But beneath that quietness, something strange had started to surface. I’d been hearing odd things—young people disappearing, some turning up dead in horrible ways, but most of them just gone. Vanished. The reports were thin, vague. Police didn’t seem too keen on digging too deep. People talked in hushed tones, like whatever was happening might hear them if they spoke too loud.

What caught my attention properly was the case of a boy. Sixteen. Lived with his mother, in a slightly run-down house on the edge of town. I decided to visit. Something about his case felt different. Not just another disappearance.

His mother answered the door looking like she hadn’t slept in weeks. Her hair was tied back messily, and her eyes were heavy and glassy. She didn’t ask many questions when I told her who I was. I think part of her was hoping someone would care enough to come.

She led me up to his room. It was quiet—too quiet for a house that should’ve had a teenager in it. The kind of silence that makes your ears ring. His room was small, cluttered, and cold. But what stood out immediately was the window. It was the only one in the room—and it was open.

I stepped closer and leaned out. There was a tree just a few feet away, its trunk old and thick, with branches brushing against the wall. Someone could’ve climbed down from here, but it wouldn’t have been easy. The bark looked scratched, maybe disturbed recently, but it was hard to tell. Still, where would he have gone? And how had no one seen him?

I remember wiping sweat from my brow even though the room wasn’t warm. Something about the place just made me uneasy.

His mother stayed near the doorway, wringing her hands. She started telling me that the boy hadn’t been himself for weeks before he vanished. He was restless, paranoid. Claimed something was watching him. She said he kept talking about a “cat-like thing” that appeared when he was alone—especially at night, when he went to bed. Not a real cat, she said. He insisted it wasn’t. He said it stared at him with human-like eyes. It never moved, just... watched.

He stopped sleeping properly. Stayed up late or didn’t sleep at all. Every time she checked on him, she found nothing. Just her son sitting in the dark, shaken.

Then she showed me his phone. It was badly broken—completely smashed, like someone had taken out their full strength on it. The boy had done it himself. According to her, he said the phone kept showing “things.” He wouldn’t explain what that meant, but he looked terrified when he talked about it.

I didn’t know what to say. I just took a few pictures of the room—the window, the floor, the phone, the tree outside. What else could I do? There were no signs of a struggle, no clues, no notes. Just confusion.

But there was one more thing. While I was in the room, I noticed a smell. Faint, but definitely there. It reminded me of rotting flesh—not strong, not overwhelming, but enough to turn your stomach for a second. I didn’t mention it. Maybe I didn’t want to sound dramatic. Maybe I just didn’t want to admit I noticed it.

When I left the house, I didn’t feel any closer to the truth. If anything, I felt more lost. Like I’d just stepped into something that didn’t belong in a newspaper column. Something that didn’t follow normal rules.

I told myself I’d go through the photos later, try to make sense of it all. But deep down, I already knew—this wasn’t going to be a typical story.

It wasn’t just about a missing boy. It was about whatever was staring at him when the lights went out.


A few days had passed since the visit to the boy's house, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong in this place —deeply, invisibly wrong. I kept going through the pictures I had taken, hoping to find a missed detail, a shadow, anything that could help explain what was going on. But there was nothing. Just empty rooms and frightened people.

Then, one evening, I got a call from a fellow reporter. His voice was low, serious, almost afraid. He told me something strange had happened in Zhilkino, a quiet residential area not far from the edge of the city. A man had locked himself in his room and was acting bizarrely. He didn’t give much detail, only said, “You’ll want to see this yourself.”

I didn’t waste a second. I grabbed my coat and called a taxi, but I also rang someone special I knew —a student psychiatrist. She was smart, calm under pressure, and open-minded, which mattered. I didn’t want someone who would dismiss things too quickly.

The ride was silent. When we reached the house, I felt something in my gut tighten. The building was old, two storeys high, with no lights on. A girl—presumably person's wife—was standing outside, crying her lungs out.

As soon as we got close, she ran to us, grabbing Yelena’s hand and sobbing, “Doc, please save my baby! Please save my baby! Please…”

The psychiatrist calmed her as best she could, assuring her that we would try everything we could. I turned on my small camera and made my way to the room where the person had barricaded himself. The door was shut tight. The hallway was dark and cold. I knocked gently at first.

"Hey!,” I called out, “please open the door. We’re here to help.”

There was a long pause, then came a muffled, broken voice from behind the wood. “Noo… I’m fine. No one can help me except that cat. Hahahaha! Go away! Leave me alone!”

His laugh… it didn’t sound human. It was hollow and stretched, like something trying to imitate amusement but not quite getting it right.

And then it hit me. That smell. The same one I remembered from the dead boy's room. Only this time, it was stronger. Thicker. Like raw, rotting meat left out in the sun. My stomach twisted a little.

“Hey,” I said again, “which cat are you talking about? What do you mean?”

No answer.

“Hey? Can you hear me? Say something.”

Still nothing. Just silence.

The psychiatrist looked pale. “His behaviour’s showing signs of paranoid schizophrenia,” she said, carefully. “But... something’s wrong. This isn’t typical. If something triggered it, it must’ve been deeply traumatic. Or…” She didn’t finish that sentence. She didn’t need to.

We stayed the whole night, trying to speak to him, knocking again and again. There were no further replies. Just occasional creaks from within the room. At one point, I swear I heard him whispering something. Not to us—just muttering. I couldn’t make out the words. I didn't want to.

When morning came, we called the local police. They arrived quickly and kicked down the door. What we saw inside still haunts me.

The person was dead. Very much dead.

The scene… it wasn’t just gruesome—it was sickening beyond belief. Blood covered the walls, the floor, even the ceiling. The knife was still in his hand, but his body was torn apart. It wasn’t a clean cut or a quick death. No, he had stabbed himself over and over, in places no human instinct would allow. His arms, legs, his chest—each wound more brutal than the last.

But it didn’t stop there. Somehow, he had skinned parts of himself, literally peeled the flesh away like you’d skin a fruit. And worst of all, he had severed his own genitals. They were lying some distance away, as if he’d thrown them across the room in his frenzy.

No one moved. Even the officers froze. I don’t think any of us had seen anything quite like it. It looked impossible, inhuman. The pain alone should’ve stopped him long before death. But somehow, he kept going. His face—though mangled—still showed an expression I won’t forget. Not just fear. Desperation. The kind that screams for help no one can give.

Blood had mixed with tears.

“This… this doesn’t look like suicide,” I whispered.

The psychiatrist nodded slowly, her hand over her mouth. “Even a madman would hesitate. The body fights pain. It doesn’t let this happen unless it’s completely broken.”

I stepped around the room, camera hanging from my neck but untouched. I didn’t even think about taking pictures. It felt wrong, almost… disrespectful. But I did look for anything that might make sense of this madness.

His laptop was closed. His phone wouldn’t turn on. It looked fine—no damage, no water, nothing. Just dead. But we did find something—a small SD card tucked behind the desk, almost hidden. One of the officers handed it to me.

Later that day, we tried checking the files. Most were blank. But one stood out. A single image file: “leer.webp”.

We tried to open it on my laptop. Nothing. File corrupted. We tried again on another device. Same thing. Even at the police station, their IT guys couldn’t get it to open. It wouldn’t display a preview. Wouldn’t extract. Wouldn’t delete either.

We even searched online—forums, file repair tools, dark corners of the internet. Nothing helped. And no one had heard of it before.

That file just sat there. Like a dead eye. Watching.

I don’t know what that guy saw. But whatever it was, it was real enough to make him rip himself apart.


It’s November 8th now. A month has passed since the incident with the person, and I’m still not over what we saw in that room. The smell. The blood. His face. I’ve stopped sleeping properly, and honestly, I don’t think I’ve eaten a full meal since then.

But just when I thought things couldn’t get worse, the name of the boy came back to my desk. At first, I thought it was a mistake—some recycled article or false lead—but no. It was him. The same boy from the first case I followed. The boy with the broken phone and the open window.

Only this time, there was no “missing” status. No speculation. No question marks. He was dead. They found him.

His body was discovered inside a deep cave system outside the city, somewhere near the forests beyond Akademgorodok. Local hikers reported a smell, and after an extensive search with police and rescue dogs, they found him. Not lying there peacefully. Not like a lost child who’d slipped and fallen. But dead. Brutally, disturbingly dead.

The cave he was in went so deep that oxygen levels at that depth were dangerously low. One of the search and rescue guys even fainted trying to get him out. But that’s not the part that stuck with me. It was how he died.

They said he strangled himself.

His hands were still wrapped tightly around his own neck, frozen in that final act. The skin had torn under his own grip. Bones were crushed. I don’t know how else to put this, but… no human could have done that to themselves. Not unless something else was forcing them. Not with that kind of power.

And his face… the way they described it was far too familiar. That same expression. That same distorted mixture of pain, fear, and the need to live. Like he was begging whatever it was to let him stay, to let him breathe. But no. It didn’t want that.

Just like the person, something got to him. Something cruel. Something that doesn't kill out of anger or hunger, but out of amusement.

And once again, there were no real signs. No solid evidence. Just the familiar smell of rot, some corrupted digital remnants, and that word that keeps haunting me—cat.

That’s what both the person and the boy mentioned before their deaths. A “cat” that stares at them. Watches. Follows. That cat that isn’t a cat! I keep going back to that, again and again. Why a cat? What was it really? Why them?

I’ve spoken to more people since then—quiet conversations in cafés, old students from the university, even a local shaman from the Buryat community. They all have their own ways of describing it. Some call it a shadow, others say it’s a spirit. One old man called it “Leeryna”— a watcher that mimics something familiar until it no longer needs to pretend.

But none of this gets me closer to the truth. Not really.

What is it? What does it want? And why does it drive them to mutilate or destroy themselves in ways no sane—or even insane—person would?

I don’t have the answers yet. All I know is that something unnatural is working its way through. Slowly. Quietly. Picking off people one by one. And the worst part?

It hides well. It knows how to avoid detection. It doesn’t leave a trail, only silence and madness.

Still… I’m not giving up.

I'll continue my search!
