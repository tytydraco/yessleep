Growing up, I think we all were raised on one particular ghost story that always stuck with us, whether it Bloody Mary or La Llorona, we all had one

However, I had the privilege of growing up in a very small Kentucky town that had its own ghost: Sally Meyer 

Since we were practically forbidden from talking about her openly, we all just stuck to talking about her in secret. There wasn't much known about Sally or how she died, but there was information that she died in the 1940s and a "Father Thomas" was involved in her death

There wasn't much else other than those two pieces of information, so there were many different interpretations about her. Some believed she was bloodthirsty ghost from hell who would kill you if you said her name 5 times. Others were that she was killed in a car accident and haunts the family of the man that killed her

But the most believable one by far was that she was murdered by a "Father Thomas" and simply roams through town in the dead of the night. You can also summon her by knocking on her bedroom window while saying her name 3 times. And who could forget the old playground song?

"Sally Meyer, Sally Meyer,
All caught up in a ring of fire,
Father Thomas was a liar,
Dear oh dear, Sally Meyer"

However, with Sally's existence, there where also rules. Some included:

1. Never mention her in front of her only living relative and father, James Meyer
2. Never mention her in front of any adults, you'll only be scolded for it
3. Remember, although she will likely not interact with you directly, she will always leave clues to let you know she's there
4. Whenever walking up to her grave, always wear white. Not doing so will lead to her perceiving you as a bad person
5. Depending on whether she perceives you as good or bad, she may help you or harm you

For privacy reasons, I will not share the name of the town (But mostly because the locals can be very hostile to newcomers)

For the entire duration of my childhood, I was both terrified and intrigued about her. Although I was terrified she would be dangerous, there was also an impending sense of mysteriousness, which we all know lead to dangerous behavior to just get a taste of whether or not she's real

However, I am a very curious and adventurous person, and I knew one day or another I would try to summon her: which ended up happening 3 weeks ago 

Just for the week, I was back in town to revisit my family and friends, and just walk down nostalgia lane. I was hoping to meet with her father, but I found out that he died in his sleep the week before, so of course, I was left on my own to figure things out

So, one night, I "went out for a walk" and approached Sally's home. I used to work for Mr. Meyer to maintain his lawn and such, but everything about the property felt off. The lawn was extremely overgrown to the point of going up to the front door, and it was clear there was no caretaker, so the town just left the house to rot, but that didn't stop me 

I walked up to house and looked all around it until I found a small bedroom. The walls were a pealing cream color, and aside from the poor state of management, everything was so neatly put together. Creepy was an understatement.

For a brief moment, I stood around and thought, "Why am I doing this? Is this really worth my time?" and I eventually decided the answer was yes

So I knocked on the window 3 times while saying her name 3 times, and right after I said it the third time, I began feeling like someone was there with me

Suddenly, I heard a raspy, chilly voice speak, "Yes, what is it you wish to ask?" I reluctantly asked, "How did you die?" And I heard the voice say, "Come inside and you will learn"

I wasn't sure what to do, but I went inside through the front door. I remembered that Mr. Meyer always kept the spare key under the door mat, so I opened it and there it was. I opened the door, trotted through the house, and I ended up in Sally's bedroom. Inside, was Sally

For one thing, her entire body was in a far state of decay, with flies and and maggots swarming her rotting body, the pale flesh pealing off of pure bone. The small bits of intact flesh she had, they were all horribly burnt to a hard crisp chip. I wanted to scream or vomit, but I couldn't do anything but stare in horror

"I don't wish to answer anymore questions." She said, before disappearing into the air. I was astonished, I couldn't even ask what happened. It all happened so fast, I could barely comprehend what just happened. Without a word, I ran out the door and to my house, shut off the lights, and tried my hardest to go to sleep.

It's been 3 weeks, and I don't think I can ever sleep or look at a human body the same way again
