I know I haven't updated in over a year. Yeah, I know; I've been doing this for almost two years now; they even got me a cake for my first anniversary.

Okay, I think I have some excuses. Around my first year on the job, I started having hallucinations: moving, irregular shadows in my peripheral vision; faces in wallpaper patterns; and figures standing in doorways, but they vanished when I looked directly at them. I recognized these signs. I've been battling them since I was nineteen. Bipolar II disorder with mixed episodes. That's why updates are so hard, especially since this job is really demanding.

Anyway, this is the fourth story. I opened the manual and found the entry. My heart sank when I saw how brief it was. Those complicated delivery assignments had pages of rules and step-by-step instructions, and if followed strictly, they'd be safe. Short instructions were different. Short instructions meant almost no one could help.

1. Deliver to 1247 Carpenter Street between 7 and 8 p.m.
2. Ring the doorbell. Wait.
3. An elderly man will open the door. He will invite you in. You must accept.
4. He will pour you tea. Accept the tea, but don't drink it.
5. He will tell you a story. Listen to it completely without interrupting.
6. After the story, give him the item.
7. He will give you something in return. Accept it gladly.
8. Leave through the front door. Don't look back at the house.
9. Deliveryman M.K.'s note: The story I heard was different each time. The one I heard was about a woman who drowned her child. I still dream about it.
10. Deliveryman P.L.'s message: He gave me a photo. The person in the photo is me, taken from my own apartment. I don't know when the photo was taken. I've changed all the locks. I've started sleeping with the lights on.
11. Deliveryman T.H.'s message: Keep whatever he gives you. I tried throwing mine away, but it came back. It always comes back.

The package was a glass container containing a small plant I didn't recognize. When I wasn't looking at it directly, the plant moved; I could see it moving out of the corner of my eye, its leaves spreading out like fingers.

It was actually a familiar neighborhood, a beautiful area with well-maintained houses and neatly trimmed lawns. The house itself was a simple two-story Victorian building, painted light blue with white accents. It didn't look like a dangerous place at all. It looked like the kind of place where Grandma would bake cookies and knit blankets.

At 7:26 p.m., I rang the doorbell.

The elderly man who answered was exactly as I expected: white hair, kind eyes, wearing a cardigan and slippers. He had a genuine smile on his face.

“Ah, the delivery has arrived! Please come in, please come in. I’ve been waiting for you.”

His voice was gentle and kind, like that of a kind grandfather. I entered the house, and he gently closed the door.

The house was spotless. Every surface was covered with a tablecloth. Family photos hung on the walls—the children, the grandchildren, and a woman who must have been his wife. The air was filled with the scent of lemon polish and aromatherapy. An old-fashioned grandfather clock in the corner ticked softly.

“Sit, sit,” he said, gesturing to a patterned sofa. “I’ll go make some tea.”

He went into the kitchen, and I sat down, placing the glass container on my lap. The plant pressed its leaves against the glass, and I swore that something in the house was watching me, something that wasn’t quite an eye.

The old man returned with a tea set: porcelain cups, a matching teapot, and a bowl of sugar cubes. He carefully poured two cups of tea, as if he had done it countless times before.

“Earl Grey,” he said, handing me a cup. “A touch of lavender. My own blend.”

The aroma was enticing. I took the cup but didn’t bring it to my lips.

He sat down in the armchair opposite me, took a sip, and smiled. “I think I should tell you the story now. That’s how it is, isn’t it?”

I nodded, hesitant to speak.

“It’s a story,” he began, his voice deepening and becoming magnetic, “about a deliveryman who broke the rules.”

A chill ran down my spine.

“Actually, he was a lot like you. Young, desperate for money, and willing to ignore the oddities of the job. At first, he did very well, meticulously following every instruction. But you know, fear is like acid, slowly eroding you until you just want to escape.”

The old man’s gaze never left me. His eyes were no longer friendly.

“On his thirty-first day of work, he received a delivery order to an apartment building. It was simple: just place the food on the door marked with a red X. But he kept having nightmares, seeing strange things. When he arrived at the building, he found three doors marked with red Xs.”

The ticking of the old-fashioned clock was deafening.

“The brochure said to call the dispatch center if anything seemed amiss. But he was too tired, really too tired, and he didn’t want to wait. So he just went with his gut and chose the middle door. He put the food down, turned around, and left.”

The old man took another sip of tea.

“The problem is that order wasn’t for a real person. It was for something else, and something with specific delivery requirements. He delivered it to the wrong door. Ah, mistakes always have consequences.”

I wanted to ask the deliveryman what happened to him, but the rules said I couldn’t disturb him.

“Three days later, they found his car outside the apartment building. The engine was still running. The door was open. The delivery bag was on the front seat, empty. But the deliveryman was still missing. Although people in the building sometimes said they heard knocking coming from the walls. The rapid knocking sounded like someone trapped, trying to escape.”

The old man put down his teacup and smiled again, this time with an ancient and eerie quality.

“The moral of this story is: rules are not arbitrarily made, nor are they suggestions, much less principles that can be interpreted arbitrarily.” He explained, like my grandfather explaining a fairy tale.

He held out his hand. “Please give me the thing.”

My hands trembled as I handed him the glass container. He took it and placed it on the table beside him. The plant inside immediately began to climb up the glass wall, its form now clearly visible.

“Now, as is customary, I'll give you a gift.”

He took a small object wrapped in white cloth from the pocket of his cardigan. It was heavy and icy cold when it was handed to me.

I slowly unwrapped it. Inside was an old-fashioned silver pocket watch, intricately engraved. But upon opening it, instead of the watch face, a photograph came into view.

It was of me, sleeping in my apartment. It was taken from the perspective of someone standing at the foot of my bed, looking down at me.

The photograph had been taken the previous night.

“A reminder,” the old man said kindly, “that you are never truly alone.”

I stood, my legs barely supporting my weight.

“Thank you for the tea,” I said in a weak whisper.

“You’re welcome,” he said. “Have a safe trip, Eric.”

I walked toward the front door, the pocket watch burning hot in my pocket. I didn’t look back at the house, though I could feel him watching me the whole way until I reached my car.

My phone buzzed. “$156.25 has been deposited into your account.”

That night, I didn’t sleep a wink. I sat in the living room, lights on, staring at the bedroom doorway, wondering if something was standing there, lurking out of sight, spying on me like a photographer spying on me as I slept.

The pocket watch was on my coffee table. I tried putting it in the drawer, but an hour later it was back on the table. I tried leaving it in the car. When I came back from the bathroom, it was on the kitchen counter.

It always comes back.

Then I wanted to tell you a nice story, to give myself a break while typing; after all, this job isn't all about cannibalistic monsters.

At 3:33 PM, the phone rang. I almost didn't want to look. But the contract bound me like chains.

The address was just one word: "Garden."

No street, no house number. Just those two words.

When I opened the booklet and found that entry, it was different from the others. The handwriting was older and more refined, as if someone had carefully written every letter.

1. When you receive the package sent to the "Garden," you've received a precious gift. Cherish this good fortune.
2. Drive north on Highway 888 until you see a dirt road marked with white stones. There are no road signs. You'll recognize it when you see it.
3. Drive 7.7 miles along this road. Even if the distance seems off, your odometer reading will still be accurate.
4. Park at the end of the road. Walk through the gate. The gate will be open.
5. The path in the garden is obvious. Follow the path to the center of the garden, where you'll see someone tending to the plants.
6. This person will talk to you. Listen carefully. They may know something about you that others don't.
7. Important: They may offer you something—food, drinks, rest, comfort, or even answers. You can accept food and drinks. You can rest if invited. You can listen for answers. However, you must absolutely not accept any physical goods or gifts, nor touch anything offered to you, except for food or drink offered directly to you.
8. This rule is absolutely valid. Whatever is offered, no matter how much you want it, you must refuse any physical goods except food and drink.
9. You will know after the meeting. Return the way you came.
10. Messenger A.M.'s message: Whatever you do, follow rule 7. My previous messengers did not follow it. They found his car at the end of the dirt road, the driver's side door open, and the engine still running. They never found him. But sometimes, delivery requests still come from "The Garden," and the customer's name is his.

This delivery was special: a simple brown paper bag, like the kind for lunch. Inside were freshly baked bread, still warm, and a bottle of unlabeled wine. The aroma of the bread was intoxicating; the fragrance of yeast was flawless.

Highway 888 stretched north from the city, through the suburbs, and into rolling farmland. It took me forty minutes to see it: a dirt road paved with smooth, rounded white pebbles, like eggs. There were no signs or markers indicating where it led, but I was absolutely certain this was it.

The road wound its way through fields of wildflowers, wildflowers that shouldn't be blooming in late autumn. Their colors were too vibrant, too perfect—blues, purples, and reds, as if radiating an inner glow. My odometer ticked up: 1.2 miles, 3.5 miles, 5.8 miles, and 7.7 miles.

At the end of the road was a gate made of living wood—trees that had grown into an archway, their branches intertwined and lush. Through the archway, I saw a garden.

It was the most beautiful place I had ever seen. White gravel paths meandered through flowerbeds laden with fruit, past fruit-laden trees, and through vine-covered gazebos. The air was filled with the scents of jasmine and honeysuckle and a unique fragrance that reminded me of childhood summers, Christmas mornings, and all my fondest memories.

The path led me deeper into the garden, past roses that seemed to whisper, telling me something in a language I could almost understand, and past apple trees, where a gentle breeze rustled the branches, creating a crisp, bell-like sound. Everything here was brimming with life; unlike ordinary plants, they were sentient, they watched, and they welcomed me warmly.

In the center of the garden was an open space with a simple wooden table and two chairs. Standing there, tending to a cluster of white lilies, was a man.

He was ordinary in every way: of medium height, with brown hair, wearing work clothes, and with his fingernails stained with dirt and sawdust. But when he turned to look at me, his eyes were ancient and kind, filled with a sorrow that seemed to encompass the entirety of human history.

“Eric,” he said, his voice like a gentle stream, like a breeze rustling through leaves, like all the comforting sounds in the world. “It’s a pleasure to have you here. Please sit down. You’ve brought bread and wine, which is very kind of you. Would you like to share with me?”

I sat there, speechless. He gently took the bag from my hands, broke open the bread, and poured the wine into two wooden glasses that had appeared on the table.

“Eat,” he said. “Drink. You’re safe here.”

The bread tasted like every delicious meal I’d ever had. The wine was just right, warming my body and soul.

“You have many questions,” he said gently. “Everyone who comes here has questions. I may not be able to answer them all, but I will do my best.”

“Who are you?” I asked softly.

He smiled. “People have called me by many names. Gardener. Shepherd. Teacher. Friend. You can call me anything that makes you feel comfortable.”

“This is… I am…”

“Dead? No. This is a place between two worlds. It’s the end of all roads and the beginning of all paths. Every messenger eventually comes here, if they live long enough. It’s a blessing.”

He took a sip of his drink and looked at me with those ancient eyes.

“By the way, your mother was good. She wanted you to know. She understood why you couldn’t be with her until the end. The living have obligations to the living, and she never blamed you, not even for a moment.”

My throat tightened, and tears welled in my eyes.

“And Cookie…” he continued, and I gasped.

Cookie. My dog. That golden retriever I got on my fifth birthday slept at the foot of my bed every night until I was thirteen, when cancer took its life. It was my best friend from childhood, accompanying me through the difficult times of my parents' divorce and through every tough moment of my growing up.

“It’s here too,” the man said softly. “Would you like to see it?”

As if summoned, I heard the rustling of paws on the gravel and the eager panting of a happy animal. Then, Cookie skipped into the clearing, looking exactly as I remembered—young, healthy, and full of energy.

He ran straight to me, tail wagging wildly, his whole body swaying. I could see every detail of him: the white markings on his chest, the darker fur around his ears, and those warm brown eyes I had gazed into countless times.

“You can pet him if you want,” the man said. “He misses you.”

I reached out, my hand trembling slightly, longing to feel that soft fur again, to hear again the satisfied sigh he made when I scratched his ear.

Then I stopped.

The little booklet. Rule Seven: You may not touch anything handed to you unless it is food or drink handed to you directly.

My hand hovered in the air, just inches from the cookie's head. He looked up at me with those trusting eyes, his tail still wagging, not understanding why I wouldn't touch him.

"I can't," I choked out, "the rules. I can't."

The man looked at me, his eyes unreadable. "You understand the rules exist with the point of being here?"

I shook my head, tears streaming down my cheeks. Cookie whimpered softly, seemingly confused by my rejection.

"Because this place is real, Eric. The garden is real, Cookie is real, and your mother is real, somewhere deep within the garden. But you don't belong here yet. You're still alive, still bound to the world of flesh and time. If you touch anything here, you establish a connection. A debt. And debts must be repaid."

He stood up, Cookie sitting at his feet, still looking at me hopefully.

He walked to where I was sitting and placed his hand on my shoulder. His touch was warm and real.

"Your choice was wise. Even heartbroken, you followed the rules. That takes strength most people don't possess." He smiled. "You'll get through these three years, Eric. Not everyone can do it, but you certainly can." Cookie stood up, walked back to me, and pressed his body against my leg. I struggled to restrain myself from touching it.

"I have to go," I choked out.

"I know. But before you go—" He pulled a small leather collar with a brass tag from his pocket. cookie's collar. "I can't give this to you. But I can give you a tip."

He whistled, Cookie barked, and then turned and ran back into the woods along the path.

I stumbled through the garden, tears drying on my cheeks, the taste of bread and wine still lingering on my tongue. The door closed softly behind me.

No phone notification. No payment received. I didn't know what my tip was.

I returned home exhausted and slept soundly for the first time in days.

Until three days later, I sat in my apartment, staring blankly at my ever-present pocket watch, when I heard scratching at the door.

I cautiously... I cautiously opened the door, my heart pounding with anxiety, fearing some deliveryman might have brought something terrifying. After all, the last time had given me quite a fright.

But standing in the doorway was a dog.

A young, healthy Golden Retriever, about four months old. It had a white stripe down its back. The fur around its chest and ears was darker. It raised its head, looking at me with warm brown eyes, wagging its tail.

It looked exactly like Cookie.

A collar hung around its neck with a note attached: "A grateful customer's tip.""

Ugh, this dog—I'll still call him Cookie—made me feel better for about two weeks, then the dreams started getting worse. Not the delivery nightmares; I'd learned to isolate those nightmares, to archive them deep in my brain where I wouldn't touch them during the day. No, these dreams were different. They were fragmented and kaleidoscopic, with me standing in several places simultaneously, time shifting back and forth, hearing every thought of everyone I'd ever met, like overlapping radio stations playing in my head.

I'd been managing my condition with medication and psychotherapy, but lately, the line between manic lucidity and depressive fog was becoming increasingly blurred.

So I made a decision. Roy Dorman. My father. I hadn't spoken to him in eleven years. The last time I called him was because my mother died.

I was going to ask him what he was doing, or at least what he'd done wrong. I went to him. His address was in a once-prosperous part of the city; the apartment buildings were dilapidated, the windows of the corner shops were fitted with iron bars, and people in such places kept to themselves, each with their own secrets they didn't want others to discover. Let me preface this by saying my relationship with him wasn't good; he wasn't very sober even before his divorce. He drank, and then… To me, eleven years old, he was just a presence, no longer my father.

His apartment was on the third floor, the stairwell reeking of cigarette smoke and mildew. I stood outside his door for a full five minutes before finally knocking.

The person who opened the door looked decades older than he actually was. Roy Dorman was fifty-three but looked seventy. His hair was mostly gray, his face was wrinkled, and his hands trembled slightly—but I couldn't tell if it was from age, from the side effects of medication, or from withdrawal.

“Eric?” His voice was hoarse. “My God, Eric?”

“Hi, Dad.”

We looked at each other across the threshold, eleven years of silence filling the space between us.

“I… do you want to come in?” "Sorry, the place is a mess; I didn't expect it—"

"I just wanted to talk," I said. "Can we talk?"

He nodded and stepped aside. The apartment was small and cluttered, but not dirty. Newspapers were piled in the corner. A horse race was playing on the television, the volume muted. The walls were covered in sticky notes, and I realized then that they were reminders of things he needed to remember: take his medication. Pay rent. Eat lunch.

I recognized the system. I had something similar in my own apartment, except my reminders were to check the manual, follow the rules, and live well.

"You look good," he said, though we both knew it was a lie. I was thin, had dark circles under my eyes, and hadn't had a haircut in months. "Anyway, better than me."

"I've been working," I said. "Actually, I'm doing pretty well."

A strange look crossed his face. "What kind of work?"

"Delivering takeout. Food delivery. The pay… not very unusual. But there are some conditions." He was silent for a long time, then went to his kitchenette and poured two cups of coffee from a coffee pot that looked like it had been sitting there for hours. The coffee was bitter and burnt, but I drank it anyway.

“I used to deliver food,” he finally spoke. “After your mother and I divorced. After I messed up all my decent jobs because of… those bastards. Because of gambling. Because of all that.” He slumped heavily into an armchair held together with duct tape. “What was the company called back then? But the job was the same. Unfamiliar place. Unfamiliar customers. Those rules only make sense when they're broken.”

My coffee cup froze in mid-air.

“You worked for them?”

“Three years, like what you’re about to do. Earned enough to pay off debts, settle down, and start over.” He laughed, but the laughter was bitter. “Of course, after five years I gambled away most of my money. But it was all my fault; it had nothing to do with the job.” “The contract,” he continued, taking a sip of coffee. “You can’t talk about it. You can’t talk to people who haven’t worked there. Remember, those words vanish the moment they leave your mouth. But you… your eyes.” I looked around the room, checking for anything that shouldn’t be there. He took another sip of coffee. “You work for them now, so we can talk.”

I put down my cup, my hand trembling slightly. “Who’s your manager?”

“A guy named Marcus. A weirdo. Knows things he shouldn’t know. Laughs like a cat that’s eaten a canary.” Roy’s eyes became vacant. “Near the end of my three years, I asked him how long he’d been in this business. You know what he said?”

I shook my head.

“He said he’d been managing couriers since the days of the carriages. He said he’d witnessed the rise and fall of empires. He said for people like him, times were different—those who made certain choices accepted certain… promotions.”

The apartment suddenly felt small and cold.

“Marcus is still there,” I whispered. “He’s still my manager.”

Roy nodded slowly. “As far as I know, he’s been there for at least fifty years. Maybe longer.” He leaned forward. “Eric, listen to me. This job, it’s intoxicating. But it also makes us vulnerable.”

“Vulnerable to what?”

“Like them. Staying after three years. Accepting promotions, benefits, endless work.” He grabbed my wrist, unusually firmly. 

“Promise me one thing. Promise me that after three years, you’ll leave. Take your money, run, and never look back.”

“Dad…”

“Promise me, Eric. The eleven years I’ve spent with you have been because I couldn’t control myself, because I let my inner demons prevail. Don’t let those inner demons prevail either. Three years. Not a day more.”

I gently pulled his hand away. “I promise.”"

We talked for another hour. He told me stories of his deliveries, of a mansion where each room corresponded to a different season, of a lighthouse that guided ships that sank a century ago, and of a library where books rewrote themselves as you read. These stories might have sounded absurd to others, but I understood them completely.

As I left, he hugged me, and I could feel how vulnerable he had become. That was about a year and a half ago, when I decided to start taking medication.

Cookies were waiting for me in the car. As I drove away, I saw my father standing in the apartment window through the rearview mirror, watching me leave.

The pocket watch in my pocket buzzed. This couldn't be." It was just a pocket watch, but now everything was more than just a pocket watch. I opened it and found the photograph had changed. The photograph showed my father and me standing in his apartment, but now there was a third figure standing behind us. He was tall, his face blurred.

I found Marcus in the warehouse office. He was flipping through some documents that looked like they were written in an ancient language that predates writing. As I walked in, he looked up, a wide, overly bright smile revealing too many teeth. This time, he wasn't pretending to be an ordinary man.

“Eric, how can I help?”

I closed the door behind me and sat down without waiting for an invitation. “My father used to work for you.”

“Ah, Roy Dorman. Yes, I remember him. He was a good messenger, mostly following the rules. He had some…inner demons, but who doesn’t?” Marcus put down his pen. I noticed the pen looked like it was made of bone. “You’ve seen him.” “How come you…” I stopped. I wanted to say, how come you’ve lived so long? What a stupid question. “He said you’ve been in this business a long time.”

“Really?” Marcus leaned back in his chair. “And what do you think, Eric?”

“I think the manual says I shouldn’t say the word ‘resign’ to you. But it doesn’t say I can’t talk about work. Talk about how long you’ve been here. Talk about what kind of person you are.”

Marcus’s smile widened. “A keen eye. You, the Dorman family, have always been clever. You know, your great-uncle also worked for us. That was in 1923. He held on for two years and three months, then tried to escape. Of course, we eventually found him. The contract was valid.”

I felt a chill. “What happened to him?”

“He became part of our collection. We always have a use for those who break contracts.” Marcus stood up, walked to the window, and looked at the warehouse floor. “But you won’t run away, right, Eric? You’ll follow the rules, serve your full three years, and then make your choice.”

“What choice?”

“The same choice I made seven hundred and forty-three years ago, or you won’t have a choice at all.” He turned to face me, and in that instant, I saw his true face—something ancient, patient, utterly inhuman, cloaked in the skin of a middle-aged man. “Leave with your sealed memories and silent tongue, return to the normal world… or stay. Accept the promotion. Become part of this machine.”

“Ah, you have an order,” he said to me. I glanced at it; there really was one—to the zoo.
