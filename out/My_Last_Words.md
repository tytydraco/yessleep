These are my last words.

I am well aware of that.

Someone sent me a letter.

Right before night, I heard a knock at my door. I peaked outside the door and all I found was a letter. I assumed it was for me but it never said my name - furthermore - the sender didn't write down her own name or address.

I had no idea who it was for and who it was from.

I shouldn't have read it - but I was always a nosey person - a lot of relationships of mine fell a part because I couldn't have just left things alone - and this time was no different.

*These Are Likely My Last Words*  
*I loved going to the beach when I was young. i remember playing in the sunlight.*  
*The forest is cold and dark. i dont want to wake up back there again.*  
*I loved playing guitar it made me feel special.*  
*Now i hardly have enough energy to play anything anymore.*  
*I loved baking with my family. being with them always made me happy.*  
*It's been days since i last spoke to them. they call me. im not able to reply. theyre worried.*  
*I want to see the sunlight. i want to play songs and bake. i want to talk to them again.*  
*But i cant. not in this body. i dont even think its my own body anymore. i need a new one.*

Despite this letter being an obvious threat that I should have taken more seriously - I just assumed it was a prank. My neighbour has a son - he is a trickster. Also, I think he's still upset about me telling his odd collections. 

I informed his parents about his 'prank' and left. Foolishly, I kept the letter to myself.

Everything was normal at first. I went to work every morning and had my walks on the weekend and spent every night writing. My basic schedule, I suppose. Each time I woke up I felt a bit more tired and a bit out of place, as if I moved around in the midnight, yet I just assumed it was all just nothing.

One day however - when I was just about to call someone - I noticed something new.

Apparently, last night I added someone to my contacts and tried to call them. My phone saved them as 'Gracie Young' - I don't know if you can tell - but I do not know anyone named 'Gracie Young'. The call was a missed call anyways - so she clearly doesn't know me either.

It was a small one off moment. I ignored it.

But the next morning - there was another call  listed. 2 more attempts to call Gracie - both rejected. 1 attempt to call 'Ma' - accepted. My mother is dead. So either I sleep-talked to the ghost of my mother, sleep-talked to someone else who had my mother's phone, or someone broke into my house to call their mother, or some other fourth option.

None of these options were favourable.

I had work - so for now - I chose to continue to ignore it.

Walking back home I felt the chilling cold breeze crawl up my sleeve. It was summer. And yet it felt so cold. I tried to work overtime so I came home late. Usually I'm moreso on schedule. But something inside me told me to avoid going home.

The beach is nearby my home. I never liked the beach, yet something urged me to go there instead.

I ignored this feeling and went home. I sat down at my table and stared down on my phone - looking at my call history. It was just one call. Just one little unimportant call. But many things can be learned from just one call.

Hesitant - I called 'Ma' back - hoping to learn something new. Tapping my wooden table impatiently - I listenned to my phone buzz - waiting for someone to respond.

Eventually, someone did.

**"Jennifer?"** The voice of an old ready speaks from the other end of the line. **"Oh Jenny! You called me back so soon! It was such a relief hearing your voice last night- please- have you made up your mind about visitting us? Me, your dad, and Gracie have all been missing you, Jenny."** She asked me. She sounded so sincere and kind. I couldn't respond to her. **"Jenny...? Dear? Are you there?"** I was not Jennifer.

I hung up on her. She thinks I am her daughter. I was not. I don't want to be her daughter.

Taking a guess, I assumed this 'Jennifer' was Gracie's sister. Thus meaning her full name would be Jennifer Young. I searched her up. I got multiple results. I searched her up alongside her sister this time. Multiple results again, but I noticed a pattern in the images.

Two brunettes - identical twins - they appeared every once in a while. All from the same instagram account.

Jennifer's.

Most of her posts seem to be 2 to 4 days a part. Yet her latest post was 2 months ago. Her mother seemed worried, so I'm assuming she has been gone for a while. I sent Jennifer a message and then sent Gracie one. Her profile was tagged in one of her posts.

After that. I continued my Night. Albeit - I was hesitant to sleep - but I knew I had to.

I woke up on my couch with a bunch of baking videos playing on my TV. Not once did I wake up at all to move - I slep the entire night - and yet I ended up somewhere else other than my bed tired.

The next night I woke up on my porch.

One time I woke up in my car. I looked at my mirror, confused. I looked different. Too different. The woman in the mirror was someone new entirely.

The day after I woke up in my bathroom with a bottle of brown hair dye. I looked up at my mirror - the same lady from yesterday appeared for a moment - she left as soon as I blinked.

One time I woke up on the beach. Far from my home

I was so tired, so sleepy, so exhausted. Sand stained my clothes and sunlight disrupting my sleep. I could hardly get up. I pulled myself up and dragged myself back towards my car. Something drove me here. Maybe it was me. Maybe it was her.

It was her.

At times when I look in my mirror. I can see her take my spot. Staring right back at me, copying each and every one of my moments. Jennifer never looks away from me. At times, she even tries to reach me. She tries to take me. She tries to replace me.

Jennifer did reply to me once - and only once - no more and no less.

"I'm Sorry."

Those will be my final words for you, Reader.

Do I understand what's going on with me? Of course not. But I know my body is no longer my own. Its hers now. If she wants to go explore the night doing whatever she wants in my own body - she can do that - I have no choice.

She will not talk to me.

She will not explain anything to me.

And she will not give me back my body.

These are my last words - you should write your own - I need a new host of my own.
