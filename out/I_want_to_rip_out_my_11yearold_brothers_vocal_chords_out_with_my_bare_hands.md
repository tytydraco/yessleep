I apologize for the gruesome title, there's nothing else to it, my brother is an asshole and a dick head to me all the time. He never stops singing, when I ask him to stop, he says say please, I say please he says "You can't control me." Even though it's a question, he instigates all the time, my parents have an extreme double standard for me and my brother, he does stuff he knows that it'll annoy me.
My brother is also a horrible liar, he lies all the time to the point I can't even leave my room without thinking of my brother is trying to sneak in and lie, an example of my brother lying is today when my brother took the meanest looking shit and didn't flush the toilet, and when I went to clean it, I told him to fix it cause it was stuck to the toilet, I told him to clean it out, and he lied to me and said I didn't do this, even though it's obvious he did because, I didn't shit yesterday or today (tmi, sorry).
We also take turns taking out the garbage in our Jack and Jill bathroom I took it out last Sunday, I told him it's his turn today, and he said that he did it last Sunday, when I did, and he knows this.

He's loud and he talks so much then he gets mad when points it out. Over the summer I spent a lot of time in the sunroom where I went to blow off steam and watch television and my brother would go back there and dance when he knew that I was angry, I asked him to leave because she stomping he's loud and he's humming, but he uses an excuse like "you can't control me" and "it's a free space" I know he's right in that sense but he's still doing it to spite me. 

At the dinner table, he moaned out of nowhere, he got it from his also asshole friends. He twerks and moans when we wrestle with each other, and he ruins any fun time I have with someone or something. He's actually so loud I can here him walking up the stairs with my door closed with music playing.

I made a joke to my sister about a song they were singing from a kids show, I asked them "are you really singing that?" And my brother walks in with the most annoyingly sarcastic  and zesty tone, "you got a problem with that song? Uh-huh that's what I thought." üòê My mind literally went to the words shut up. 

We got cats in 2019-2020 and one of the first things the past owners told us were, don't crowd the cats. My brother walks up to me and starts petting the eldest cat Sam, right when I start petting him, I don't mean to be a ü§ì, but I told him the past owners said, " don't crowd the cats and he still fucking does it. How do I live with my dick head brother
