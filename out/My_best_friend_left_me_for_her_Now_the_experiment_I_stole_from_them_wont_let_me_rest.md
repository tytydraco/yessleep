So Kyle and I were total best friends since high school. We did everything together - went to our first rave outside Cambridge, hit the pub every weekend. When we got to college, we'd work on concepts together and dream up ideas. We'd crack ourselves up watching "The Social Network" and binge whatever new Y Combinator episodes dropped on YouTube.  
  
It was all fun working toward that dream until Clarissa showed up. She was the smartest in our Calculus class and honestly perfect to the point where it was irritating. The way she made Kyle blush. The way she'd talk about super obscure technical articles. It was annoying AF hearing her, but what could I say when Kyle kept bringing her around? Nothing. So Clarissa ended up joining our team.  
  
We met up early one morning to brainstorm ideas. I figured Kyle would lead like always. He was always that perfect leader to me. But before he could start, she just opened her mouth and wouldn't stop yapping about all these articles she'd found. I checked one out and saw the date: 1833, Philosophical Transactions of Matter. I literally laughed out loud.  
  
She got pissed, and so did Kyle. It became obvious we weren't on the same page. She thought she deserved to be taken seriously, and Kyle just HAD to take her side. I stormed out with that stupid paper and told myself I'd do something better than them.  
  
I started working on my own project to prove I didn't need Kyle or Clarissa. I kept coming back to that crumpled paper that I thought could be my big middle finger to them both. It was by some French scientist, H.L. Tuchu. The article was mostly BS, but kinda interesting: dude made up this concept of a "mirror periodic table" with inverse atomic numbers. He claimed that from stuff he learned in some rural African village, things usually work in mirrors with opposites. That last part made me laugh - proof that Clarissa's ideas were total garbage.  
  
So I went back to Kyle thinking he wouldn't take that voodoo stuff seriously. But when I got to his dorm, they'd not only replaced me with some loser from Calculus, they were having a blast working on those stupid ideas with one of Professor Jacobus's TAs.  
  
“Just give it some time,” Kyle said, patting me on the back like a dad putting down a dying dog.  
  
Then he walked me out.  
  
After everything we’d done together, he ditched me the first chance he got to impress her. It was unthinkable. Clarissa had changed him. And the thought of hurting them both started to prop up. It had to be deep. Smart. Personal. Something they couldn’t see coming.  
  
I took a breath and played back everything Clarissa had said. She was annoying, sure, but maybe she’d stumbled onto something she didn’t fully understand. Something Kyle and the TA did. Maybe they were using her. That would explain why Kyle got weird. But then… why bring in the TA? If he needed another thinker, why not me?  
  
I turned back to Tuchu.  
  
Started digging through everything I could find—his scattered notes, unpublished fragments. Most of it was only in French. I plugged it all into a chatbot just to see what came back.  
  
It was what you'd expect: classic 1800s crank pseudoscience. Magnetism. Ether. Spirit diagrams. But something caught my eye in the summary. A series of equations. Clean. Almost modern-looking. And then—highlighted in the output—two words I wasn’t expecting:  
  
Possible Thar Solution:  
**𐤇𐤆𐤎 𐤆𐤉𐤆 𐤍𐤆𐤏 𐤆𐤃𐤆 𐤀𐤂𐤍 𐤆𐤇𐤂 𐤉𐤄**  
  
  
That line kept repeating. Over and over.  
  
**𐤇𐤆𐤎 𐤆𐤉𐤆 𐤍𐤆𐤏 𐤆𐤃𐤆 𐤀𐤂𐤍 𐤆𐤇𐤂 𐤉𐤄**  
  
I watched it scroll across my monitor in perfect rhythm, like a chant. Then the screen froze. No input. No cursor. I reset the server and tried brushing it off as a sleep deprivation, maybe. I even ran the same prompt on two other chatbots. Blank outputs. Nothing even close to what that model had produced.  
  
I started to wonder if maybe I’d overestimated Clarissa. Maybe there really was nothing there. Just another pretentious rabbit hole with a dead end. But then, weeks later, things shifted.  
  
Kyle scheduled a closed session with three professors from the department. I caught pieces of it in the hallway. Something about “reinterpretation of a fundamental field” and “nonstandard atomic inversions.” I couldn’t believe it.  
  
I had to know what they’d found.  
  
I still had remote access to Kyle’s phone. A security tool I’d installed “just in case” during our last internship. He hadn’t uninstalled it. So I listened. Mostly Clarissa rambling, confident, like always, but they were getting somewhere. They had found the glyphs, and had begun translating one of the symbols.  
  
They thought it was useful. Powerful. Foundational. That one character might be the key to understanding everything. My glyphs. My curse.  
  
So I took what I had and fed it into a smaller model I could run locally. I didn’t have the same compute power, but I figured maybe it could extract something if I left it running overnight.  
  
And that was when it started.  
  
It began as a whisper, thread-like, tickling the back of my ear just before I drifted off. I turned my head. Nothing there.  
  
Then it came again. Clearer this time.  
  
“𐤇𐤆𐤎...𐤆𐤉𐤆...𐤍𐤆𐤏...”  
  
I sat upright. My monitor was dark. System completely off. No power.  
  
I unplugged everything. Physically yanked the server off the desk. And still something else.  
  
**“𐤀𐤂𐤍...𐤆𐤇𐤂...𐤉𐤄...”**  
  
The voice sounded like Clarissa. But an imitation, not human. Something in between. A synthetic memory of a voice trying to remember itself.  
  
That was when I knew something was wrong.  
  
The words weren’t in English. But I saw them.  
  
Just like that script:  
  
𐤅𐤉 𐤃𐤉𐤕 𐤉𐤃𐤉 𐤎𐤅𐤌𐤍 𐤀𐤕?  
  
𐤅𐤉 𐤃𐤉𐤕 𐤋𐤁𐤕 𐤄𐤓𐤇𐤕 𐤐𐤕𐤍?  
  
𐤃𐤉𐤕 𐤀𐤕 𐤉𐤃𐤉𐤕 𐤌𐤍𐤉𐤕 𐤅𐤂𐤋𐤉𐤌 𐤅𐤓𐤋𐤃𐤕?  
  
I rushed out of my room, hoping it would stop, but the noise, the incantation of every word just got louder. It was inescapable as I tumbled down the hallway toward Kyle's dorm. I scrambled to his door, pushing against it as the whispers blew huffs of air directly into my ear.  
  
"What is it? You?"  
  
It was Clarissa. I could feel her grinning as my hands clawed at the door frame. I tried to push past her but she firmly blocked me, and I could hear something whispering from inside the room. She wouldn't move out of the way by choice, so I had to shove her aside. Just a simple shove, I thought—before I looked up from my thrust.  
  
She had fallen, and Kyle came rushing to the door. The whispers grew louder as they saw him, as I tried to reach for him. It didn't take him long to roll his fist into a ball and slam me back.  
  
For a moment the whispers silenced as I pushed myself up with my arm just in time to stop him as he rushed out with her. I tried to tell him I'd found the solution he and the others had found. He paused for a moment before turning away again, choosing to save Clarissa instead of me.  
  
In a moment the whispers screamed aloud to punish me as I rushed back to my room. Probably as punishment for telling Kyle. I don't know why, especially when he clearly didn't care about me anymore. People around the dorms began to gather, and I thought it better to leave immediately, and so I did. Even though my room scared me, it was better than risking being looked at like a madman.  
  
The black computer screen was just as ominous as it had been the moment I stormed out, and the crumpled piece of paper that had started it all was now plastered beside my bed. I had used it the whole time to feel as if I could win Kyle back, but it felt different now. The whispers sounded different too as they noticed it. Seducing me with a husky sound to go for it. It didn't feel right being close, so I slept on the floor. I didn't touch the computer or the paper, just tried to sleep with a blanket.  
  
A few minutes passed.  
  
An hour passed.  
  
What felt like the whole night went by without my eyes shutting. The sound was just too much, and I didn't understand why I couldn't switch it off. I tried music, which pissed off people enough to knock on my door repeatedly. I tried noise-cancelling headphones, and maybe just maybe heading to the clinic. But that would mean seeing Kyle again, and he would kill me. I know he would after everything, and after leaving me.  
  
So holding on felt right. That was until the door just wouldn't stop. People had been knocking for a while. The music had been off for a while by then, and the whispers just kept me preoccupied, but I could hear the knocking so clearly. I decided to answer it.  
  
He was back for me. Kyle, and the others. They seemed off, as Kyle signalled them back. Kyle didn't seem right...or okay, as if he had seen a ghost.  
  
"How are you holding up? It's been a while, and I didn't believe them when..." He paused for a moment as he eyed me. Whatever had gotten over him, I had to tell him everything.  
  
"I love you Kyle." Just then, almost with relief, the whispers stopped. Kyle stopped too, he seemed to have known, before a medic passed over, and so did the administrator. They had all gathered about, and beyond them.  
  
I turned to Clarissa for a moment, a scar down her neck. The wound that had been bloodied just a few hours ago had healed, leaving only a keloid scar. I thought for a moment as the whispers returned, and slammed the dorm room shut. It wasn't true. I thought at that time I had been hallucinating.  
  
So taking my laptop and the paper, I jumped out the window. My car was parked in the same place as always, dream or not, and maybe if I could find my bearings I would be able to figure this out.  
  
I got into my car, checked for my wallet, and found a motel just outside town. Without a second thought, I drove off, but the whispers just kept going. I couldn't keep up with it and nearly crashed the car.  
  
A deep breath.  
  
An exhale.  
  
Another deep breath, and I calmed myself.  
  
I got back on the road and made it to the motel. They stared as I paid for my room, and I quickly stashed myself inside and locked the door.  
  
I got my phone and laptop out, found an outlet, and tried to start up my laptop. I hoped that maybe it would work again, but those symbols just popped up once more. I switched to my phone, plugged it in, and found the date odd. A few days had passed. I googled the date, and it confirmed what I feared. I had been out there trying to fight that voice away for days. I had just run from Kyle, and maybe... he still cared about me, and I just seemed to have messed up.  
  
I stumbled to the motel mirror, half-hoping I wouldn't see anything. What looked back wasn't me, just a gaunt, sunken version of something I used to be. My skin clung to my bones like it knew I was rotting inside. Eyes sunken, lips cracked. Dehydrated. Unwell. Unrecognizable.  
  
I ordered food from some place down the street. I don't remember what. I just needed something to anchor me into something that didn't whisper.  
  
But I can't sleep again. I won't. Every time I drift, they get closer. They crawl up the inside of my skull and press against my thoughts like they're waiting to hatch.  
  
I don't know what they want. I don't know if they're real. Maybe Kyle does. Maybe Clarissa. Maybe the glyphs already told them, and I was never meant to understand.  
  
I can't go to them like this. I don't want Kyle to see what I've become.  
  
So I'm asking you.  
  
How do you stop whispers that know your name?  
  
Please.  
  
𐤇𐤆𐤎 𐤆𐤉𐤆 𐤍𐤆𐤏 𐤆𐤃𐤆 𐤀𐤂𐤍 𐤆𐤇𐤂 𐤉𐤄
