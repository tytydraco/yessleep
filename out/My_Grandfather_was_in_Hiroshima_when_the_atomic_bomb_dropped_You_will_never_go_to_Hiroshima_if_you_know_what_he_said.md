When I was young, my grandfather never talked much about the war. He lived a quiet life, smoked his pipe every evening, and only ever raised his voice when I left the door open and let the mosquitoes in.

But sometimes—late at night, when he’d had a few too many sips of sake—he’d tell me pieces. Always pieces. Never the whole story.

He was in Hiroshima on the morning of August 6, 1945. Not a soldier, not even a worker. Just a boy delivering rice for his father’s shop. He told me he saw the flash. He never called it an explosion—always the “flash.”

He said:

> “It was like the sun had landed on Earth. A second sun, brighter than anything, and hotter than a god could bear.”



The flash blinded him. He woke hours later, lying in the street. His skin was burned raw, blistering, but he was alive. That fact haunted him until the day he died.

When he stumbled through the ruins, he said the city wasn’t destroyed—it was peeled open. Buildings split in half, walls melted, steel sagging like wax. People walked around with their faces sliding off their skulls, skin dripping from their arms like candle wax. He told me he saw a woman clutching a baby so tightly the baby’s head had fused to her chest from the heat.

He stopped telling me details after that.

But one night—just one—he told me what scared him the most.

Not the fire.
Not the burns.
Not even the sickness.

He said when night came, the city didn’t stay quiet.

He heard people screaming, crying for water. That part everyone knows. But he said some of the voices weren’t human anymore.

> “They were burned too much,” he whispered. “Their mouths melted shut. Their lungs cooked. But still—they made noise. Not screaming. Not talking. Just a noise. Like… a kettle boiling. Hundreds of them. All around.”



He said the noise didn’t fade with time. For days after, even when the bodies were gone, even when the city was cleared, he swore he could still hear it at night.

That’s why, when his family moved back decades later, he refused. He said Hiroshima wasn’t a city anymore—it was a grave. A grave so deep it swallowed the voices of the dead and let them out only at night.

He made me promise never to visit. He said if I stood there at night, really listened, I’d hear the same sound he did.

I used to think it was just trauma. Just the broken memories of a young boy who saw the worst thing imaginable.

But last year, I broke my promise. I was in Japan, and I went. Just for one night. I stayed near the memorial, and I listened.

The city is beautiful now. Lights, food stalls, children laughing. A place rebuilt. A place of peace.

But at 2 AM, when the streets emptied and the night grew heavy, I heard it.

Not loud. Not right away. But faint—like a pot beginning to simmer. Dozens of faint whistles in the dark. Some high. Some low. All wrong.

The sound crawled under my skin. It wasn’t just noise—it felt wet, like steam forcing its way through raw flesh. My stomach turned, and suddenly I understood what my grandfather had meant. These weren’t sounds that belonged to the living. They were forced out of bodies that should have been silent.

I froze. My heart hammered so violently I thought my ribs would crack. Every hair on my arms rose as if the night air had teeth. I wanted to run, but my legs refused to move. It was like the ground itself was holding me there, making me listen.

And then, underneath the whistling, I heard something else. A dragging sound. Slow, sticky, like burned skin peeling off stone. It was faint, but it was moving closer.

The memorial park was empty—I’d checked a dozen times before sitting down—but in that moment I knew I wasn’t alone. My grandfather had described voices. He hadn’t warned me about footsteps.

The boiling noises grew sharper, more desperate, as if they sensed me. I clamped my hands over my ears, but the sound wasn’t outside anymore—it was inside, rattling in my skull. My teeth ached from it. My eyes watered.

I stumbled backward, trying not to scream, but I swear I saw movement in the dark. A figure at the edge of the path—charred black, glowing faintly red in the chest, like a coal. Its head tilted at an angle no living neck could manage.

The whistles swelled into a chorus, and for one horrific moment, I thought I could hear words inside them. Not clear words, but pleading. A single, endless demand: “Water.”

That broke me. I ran until my lungs were on fire, never daring to look back, the whistles chasing me all the way to my hotel.

By the time the sun rose, the city was bustling again—bright, clean, alive. Tourists walked past me, laughing, completely unaware. It was as if the night had never happened.

But I know better.

My grandfather was right. Hiroshima isn’t a city—it’s a grave. And graves don’t forget what’s buried in them.

And if you ever go… don’t listen too closely.

Because once you hear them, you’ll never stop.
