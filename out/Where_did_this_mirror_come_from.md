This is my first time posting here and I don’t know if this is the right place so please let me know if I need to take this down, also sorry for the long read and bad formatting I just typed this up while laying in bed try to not look at it.

Ok so there is a really long story leading up to this and I won’t bore you with all the details but the need to know stuff is, I(20m) live with two roommates one of them is a man about 45 years old, we can call him Tim, he is just one of those goofy southern guys, he’s an electrician, he always keeps the house clean and makes dinner, I don’t know him well but we hang out every now and then he’s easy to get along with. The other roommate we will call him John he is a young guy no older than 18 I don’t know how he pays his share because he doesn’t work hell he never even leave his room and the few times I have seen him he was very quiet, I hate to be mean but he also smells awful almost like the smell of boiled eggs that have been sitting in a hot bowl for weeks, but he keeps to himself so I guess he’s not to bad.


Ok now this has been a rough couple of days so sorry for any inconsistencies it’s probably because I’m tired. Anyway this all started last Sunday, it was a normal day, I was just in my room playing video games like usual I was struggling with a boss on this game I have been playing so I was a little agitated and very focused, I was so close to finally beat the boss when I hear a voice to my left yell. “HEY CHUCKLE NUTS!”. I almost jumped out of my seat, then all I hear is Tim laughing his ass off in the hall, “Damn it Tim, you almost gave me a heart attack” I say as he continued to laugh, after a few minutes her finally calmed down, “wow, that was a good laugh kid, you should have seen your face, anyway why don’t you put that controller down and come help me get this box in the house” he said. I was still a little mad but i definitely needed to take a break from gaming so I agreed. 


I followed him down the stairs and out the front door, there was a huge cardboard box on the porch labeled fragile, “what’s in here?” I asked him he waved me to grab the other side of the box and said “I don’t know kid, i thought it was yours” I just shrugged as we lifted the box through the door, it was heavy as hell so we just put it in the living room “damn it son, what’s in here, johns mail-order bride” Tim said as he started laughing. “She needs to lay off the cheese cake” I say trying to catch my breath. I didn’t know what this box was but I didn’t really care I had a boss to beat so I went back to my room, as I pass Johns room I knocked on the door and said, “Your box is in the living room” I waited a second but he didn’t say anything so I just went back to my game.


A few days went by pretty normally, that box sat in the living room for a two days and then on Tuesday when I got home from work it was gone. I didn’t think too much of it but I was confused how John moved it on his own, I know Tim didn’t help him because Tim has been at work all day, and that box was really heavy, my back is still sore from just carrying it through the door. Johns room is up a flight of stairs and down a small hallway, there is now way he moved it all the way up the stairs and fit it through the hall all by himself. I was even more confused when I noticed that John wasn’t home John is always home so that was odd, I only knew he was gone because his bedroom door was open and he never leaves his door open, I wanted to go I there and see what was in the box but his room smells so bad that I almost blew chunks right there so I just left it alone.


 Later that night I walk down stairs to see if Tim is cooking dinner but instead of finding Tim in the kitchen I see John, he is just sitting at the kitchen table not eating or anything just sitting there waiting, now I want to say John is a weird guy but this was odd even for him. “Hey John, what’s up? Is everything alright?” I asked him, I was a little worried about him even if we are good friends or anything, he just looked up at me and asked “did you put that mirror in my room?” “No, what mirror?” I asked but he didn’t answer me he just got up and went to his room, I tried to hide my disgust as he walked past me, the smell was so bad. I was a little confused but I shook it off and got some food, I’m not the best cook and Tim wasn’t home so I just made some pizza rolls and went back to my room and eat my pizza rolls, watch some tv and head to bed.


Ok ok, I know that’s a lot of useless information but it was necessary for you to understand the next couple of days.


The next day I wake up and looked at my phone and it was 10:00am, I immediately jumped out of bed and started getting ready because I was late for work. On my way to the bathroom which is at the end of the hall, I walked past Johns room and he was not in there, John going out two days in a row was really out of character, but what was even more out of character was the smell, his room didn’t stink it actually smelled good, now I was really curious so I went in his room and took a look around. His room was clean almost like nobody had been in there for weeks, the drawers where all full of neatly folded clothes, his bed was made well, I was so confused where was John and why is that smell gone?


After a few minutes of poking around I saw it, there was a mirror, as soon as I saw it I knew that was what was in the box, it was tall and thick about the same size as a door. Something about it was off, I could see my reflection but I didn’t look like me, I can’t describe it but I looked like I was part of an old blurry picture or something I don’t know, my face was my face but it just felt wrong, I got closer and the closer I got the more different I looked. I had to get to work so I got out of there, I grabbed my clothes and headed to the shower, I turned the water on and took one last look at my phone before getting in, I almost didn’t believe it when I saw my phone, it was 1:00pm. I was in his room looking at that mirror for THREE FUCKING HOURS! Now I was spooked so I skipped the shower and just got dressed and went to work.


I don’t know what happened in there but I needed to get my mind off of it so I focused on work, I work at a diner as a waiter, I got to work late but my boss wasn’t to mad because I don’t show up late often so he let me slide. My day when on like usual, I had the normal grumpy customers and a few nice old couples that tip well, nothing out of the ordinary, until I when to the bathroom and I saw it, my reflection in the bathroom mirror was the same, I was me but also not me, I looked blurry and my eyes, my eyes were not mine. 


I dont remember the rest of that night, the next thing I remember was waking up in my bed Thursday morning. I was so confused and I had a headache I was so glad that I was off work that day because I felt exhausted, I laid in my bed for a few minutes just stoat the ceiling before I saw it in the corner of my eye, I felt the hairs on my arm stand up when I noticed it, the mirror was in my room right across from my bed, I didn’t want to look at it, I didn’t want to see want I looked like. 


After talking myself into it I closed my eyes and made my way to the door, i slammed my toe into the doorway as I walk out of my room “oh fuck!” I yelled, it felt like I broke my toe so I hoped down the stairs and sat down at the kitchen table, the kitchen table is straight across from the living room and in the living room, we have the living room set up so you can see the tv from the kitchen table because Tim likes to watch sports as he eats. My toe was all busted up and bleeding, I put a towel on it trying to keep the mess to a minimum. As I sat there noticed I could see my reflection in the black tv screen, the eyes, I can’t tell you what exactly is wrong but the eyes on whoever’s face was looking at in the place of my own their eyes where off, the eyes didn’t even look human, I couldn’t stop looking at those eyes. 


BANG, the front door slammed. “Hey kid, what channel is this” Tim said as he chuckled at his own joke. “Hey Tim, you’re home early.” I said. “Early! That’s a good one.” He remarked before he turned to walk upstairs, I glanced at the clock on the cable box, it was almost midnight I had been sitting there all day, almost 15 hours. “Did you put that mirror in my room?” I ask Tim catching his attention before he walks away, he turns to me “what are you talking about kid, you know you can’t have any mirrors in your room” he said, “wha… what do you mean?” I asked confused. “Because your ugly mug would break the thing” he started laughing hysterically, his joke was funny but it was not the time for jokes, so I got up and headed to my room. 


He called out from behind me“Hey kid, you know I didn’t mean that it was just a joke, don’t be mad. Fine go lock yourself in your room like John did” John? Where was John I thought to myself. “It’s fine Tim I’m not mad, but have you seen John recently?” I asked, he looked confused, “are you feeling alright kid?” He asked, I had no idea why he was asking me that, I just looked at him confused, “Have you been smokin that stuff boy? How could you not remember what happened” what happened? I think to myself as Tim just looked at me like I’m crazy. “Hey kid, I know it’s been a long couple of days since you found John like that” I interrupted him “what? Found John like what?” He sat me down on the stairs that I was standing on, “damn, you really don’t remember? you found John in his room with his… his eyes gouged out.” I got nauseous and my stomach curled but I managed to ask “what about the mirror?”he quickly said “I don’t know you move it into your room the night after you found him” I vomited right there on the steps and I guess I passed out because I don’t remember anything after that.


I just woke up, it’s 8:00pm Saturday night, I don’t remember anything from yesterday or today, I think I was asleep but I guess I can’t trust my own memory so I don’t really know. Now I’m just laying here in my bed, it’s right there, that mirror, I’m scared to look at it, I know I will see those eyes again, I know I shouldn’t look but it’s so tempting.

I’m posting this to ask if any of you have any idea what’s going on, am I going insane, is there something in this mirror, what’s happening? Please any input would be appreciated.
