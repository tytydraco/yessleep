This started about 6 years ago, I've forgotten about it now. But I wanted to share this with you all. My experience.

I live with my mom, a house that fits 2 people. My dad died a few years ago, when I was 12. He died from food poisoning which I didn't know how he died after consuming mashed potato. But let's get to the point.

It was a quiet evening. I was on the couch eating the sandwich I made. Cheese, bacon, and mayo. It's just your casual sandwich. The remote on my hand, I was looking through the channels, looking for an interesting show to watch.

My mom walked behind the couch and spoke. "I'll be gone tomorrow , I'll be going on a business trip. Make sure to feed King." I nodded as she walked out the door and closed it. I forgot to mention, It's a white Siberian cat, King. I found him in the pet store 4 years ago, I bought him to chase off the rodents at our house, I've gotten pretty used to him now. My eyes locked onto the television as I watch the entertainment, I took a bite of my sandwich and picked up my phone. It was 8:07 pm. I stood up and left my sandwich on the plate, left the television on channel 41. I walked to my bedroom to see King sitting on my bed, I held him in my hands and took him off my bed. I changed my bedsheets after. I came back to the television and turned it off, I finished my sandwich and washed my plate and headed to bed.

It was a quiet night, so I fell asleep faster than I thought. I was walking down the sidewalk and headed to the convenience store, It looked like it was brand new but im sure it opened 2 years ago. I came in and took 2 pieces of canned cat food, the price was unusual cause it's expensive, but I didn't bother.

I came to the cashier to pay for the cans then they spoke. "It's uncommon for young people to come here especially at midnight."
"Huh?"
I responded. 
"This is pretty too much for a cat."
They replied.
The cans were big which was enough to make atleast one cat full. But King eats alot, that's why I bought 2 cans of chicken flavored cat food. Chicken was his favorite food, I feed him cooked chicken when there wasn't any cans of cat food in the pantry. But of course, I really had to stock up on cat food. 
"He's a white Siberian cat, his name is King. He eats alot."
"Why don't you buy 5 of these?"
"They looked expensive, I don't have that much money on me aswell." 
I took the plastic bag in my hands and exited.


As I walked out of the store, headlights bright, it was silent outside. I heard footsteps behind me, I tried to look back to see who it was, but I suddenly felt a sharp pain on my stomach.
I kneeled down, dropped the plastic bag of cat food, and saw that my hand was full of blood,
The blood was dripping from my body.
I didn't bring anything with me, except for a bag with chicken flavored cat food.
I tried to stand up, but I fell down on my knees again. The pain was excruciating. My eyes slowly close, the sound of faint footsteps, slowly fading. 

Then I woke up in my bed. I thought that all of what happened before was just a bad dream.
I saw King walking around my bedroom, I stepped off my bed and tried to pet him, instead he was startled when I tried to touch his head. He walked away from me. I noticed that he didn't look at me when he got startled.
I walked into the living room and made my casual sandwich, cheese, bacon, and mayo. I took a look on my phone and saw that it was November 27, which was seven days ago. I muttered, "It's probably just an error with my phone." 

I walked to the couch and sat, my mom looked over me and I looked at her aswell.
Tears we're flowing down her cheeks, eyes red, she was crying.
"Son..?" 
She stuttered.
"Yes mom?"
I exclaimed.
She looked back at the television, focusing on the channel she was watching.
I was confused, I finished my sandwich and stood up to wash my plate. 
Then I heard my name.
"Robert William Redwood"
Shivers went up my spine. I looked over to the television and saw the news reporting about a murder that happened 7 days ago.


My mind flashed back to my 'bad dream' I had. 
I ran outside, I knew where the store was. Then I saw the convenience store, the spot where I died we're surrounded by police, the cashier that I saw in my dream.

It happened.

I can hear the police speaking to the cashier, he was asking them questions.
"You saw him last night?"
"Yes sir."
"He bought 2 cans of chicken flavored cat food."
It was the same voice I heard in my dream.

I saw my body being carried.

I ran to the house and my mom we're surrounded with 2 police officers. 
My mom was sniffling and stuttering as she spoke.
"I don't know what happened...I was on a business trip, I only left him for a week."
"Have you experienced any unusual or weird happenings in your house?"
"I heard footsteps and the water was running, I was only sitting on the couch watching the news.."
"Do you have any pets in the house?"
"We owned a white Siberian cat, his name is King."
I understood what was happening.
As I walked slowly to my bedroom, I sat on the bed and hugged my knees.


Here I am, 6 years older, writing this story. I don't know how I could still interact with things, though. But it felt like people treated me as a ghost, like im invisible.

(it's my first time so tell me if I did any grammar errors)
