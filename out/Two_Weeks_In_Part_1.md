My name is Ethan MacMiller, and today is July 31st, 2003. This is my diary. My therapist suggested I write about my current and past experiences as a "coping mechanism." I think it's all lies and nonsense, but I have no choice but to comply. I am 32 years old. I have a sister named Debra, whom I call "Deb" or "Debbie." I don't talk much about my parents, and I certainly won't be discussing them here.

As a child, I was terrified of the dark, haunted by a fear of something lurking when I thought I was alone. As I grew older, I overcame those fears and became a detective to uncover the darkness. I was good at my job and well-respected. Afterward, I became obsessed with the mysteries of the afterlife—heaven or hell. I delved into the world of spirits, ghosts, and ghouls.

My work as a detective wasn't just about solving crimes; it was about uncovering truths hidden in the shadows. Each case I solved brought me closer to understanding the darkness that once scared me. But even as I earned respect and recognition, my curiosity about what lies beyond death grew stronger. This fascination with the afterlife wasn't just a passing interest—it became an obsession. I started researching paranormal phenomena, attending séances, and visiting haunted places. I was driven by a need to understand what happens after we die and to confront the fears that once controlled me.

Once, a case about a murder in a house that was now said to be haunted caught my attention, and I instantly volunteered for it. Little did I know it would scar me for life. I knocked on the door, and a woman greeted me. She looked overworked and tired, wearing blue and white patterned clothing that was wrinkled and stained, as if she had been cooking.

I introduced myself and explained why I was there. She invited me in for dinner, which I found odd but intriguing. As I stepped inside, the stench hit me like a wall. The house was a mess—garbage everywhere, maggots crawling, flies buzzing, and trash bags piled in every direction. I pinched my nose to keep from gagging as we made our way to the kitchen. The sound of the door locking behind me sent a shiver down my spine.

The kitchen was no better. Dirty dishes were stacked high, food scraps littered the floor, and the smell of rot was overwhelming. The woman gestured for me to sit at the table, which was covered in grime. As she started to prepare dinner, I noticed her eyes had a vacant, haunted look.

I pulled out my notepad and started scribbling about the disarray in the house. After jotting down a few notes, I stood up from the chair and decided to walk around, hoping to engage the woman in some small talk. However, she remained unresponsive, merely humming to herself as she prepared a meal that I couldn't quite see. As I wandered through the house, my attention was drawn to the dimly lit upstairs. Through the faint glow of the living room, I noticed a child no older than twelve peering at me from the top of the stairs. She seemed to be hiding, allowing only the upper half of her face to be visible. Her eyes, though, were unnervingly distinctive: entirely devoid of color except for the dark, unblinking pupils. The stark contrast left her gaze haunting and unsettling, as if her eyes held a darkness beyond human comprehension.

The sight unsettled me, but I stayed focused on my work. I asked the woman if she had any children, but she didn’t respond. Her humming persisted as if I hadn’t spoken, adding to the eerie atmosphere of the house. As I continued my observations, I noticed a sudden, unsettling chill in the air. The lights flickered briefly, and then the room fell into a deeper silence. I glanced back toward the stairs, but the child was gone, leaving only the lingering feeling of being watched. 

as 8:42 PM—odd for what should have been dinnertime, but I brushed it off.

Then, a rancid odor of rotting meat filled the air. I turned back to find the woman staring at me with an unnerving intensity. She simply said, “Eat.”

My gaze shifted to the food she had prepared. It was a grotesque, greenish-brown concoction that vaguely resembled meat, crawling with wriggling maggots. My stomach churned, and I told her I wasn’t hungry. Her demeanor abruptly changed; her face contorted with rage as she screamed, “Eat it!”

Panicked, I pulled out my phone and headed for the door. Just as I reached for the handle, my vision abruptly darkened, and I was knocked unconscious.

When I came to, I was disoriented and my surroundings felt foreign. I found myself lying on a cold, hard surface, my head throbbing. As my vision cleared, I realized I was in a dimly lit, unfamiliar room. The walls were lined with old, dusty shelves filled with strange, archaic objects—jars of preserved specimens, faded photographs, and what looked like ancient tomes.

The room was eerily quiet except for a low, rhythmic humming that seemed to come from somewhere nearby. I tried to move but found that my hands were bound behind me. Panic set in as I struggled against the restraints, but they were too tight.

A large man appeared at the doorway, his pale face expressionless. “You’re awake,” he said calmly, stepping into the room. His presence sent a shiver down my spine.

He walked over to a table in the corner where He began preparing something out of sight. The room's oppressive atmosphere and the remnants of the earlier meal made my stomach churn again. As I struggled to free myself, I noticed a small window high up on one wall, partially obscured by heavy drapes.

I had to figure out how to get out of this room, uncover the person intentions, and understand why I was brought here. The eerie humming continued, blending with the silence and heightening my sense of dread.

I looked down and realized my right hand was trapped in a sinister contraption, akin to a finger-cutting machine. My fingers were splayed wide, unable to move, and the metal apparatus held them rigidly in place. Panic surged through me as I struggled, but the more I wriggled, the tighter the restraints seemed to become.

The man, his demeanor as cold and impassive as ever, placed a large set of surgical tools on the table before leaving the room. The clatter of the tools was the only sound as she exited, leaving me alone in the dimly lit space.

I turned my gaze to the left and my blood ran cold. There, in an identical contraption, was a deceased man. His jaw was missing, leaving his tongue dangling grotesquely, and his fingers were gone—apparently severed. His eyes were nowhere to be seen, and the sight was chilling.

The realization hit me like a ton of bricks: the trash bags strewn around the room were not just refuse—they were body bags. The foul smell that had pervaded the house was now unmistakably linked to the gruesome contents within them. The room, once just eerie, now felt like a chamber of horrors, and the man's intentions became terrifyingly clear.

I had to find a way out quickly before I met the same fate as the man, and I had to do it before the man returned with those surgical tools.
