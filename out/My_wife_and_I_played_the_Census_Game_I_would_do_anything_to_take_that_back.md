I was sitting in my home office, procrastinating getting back to work, by playing word games on my computer, when they first announced it.  


  
I heard my phone buzz, and looked down at it, to find a text that read:  


  
"Tomorrow, we will pilot a new app called the Census Game for select residents. To opt in, reply YES to this text, and we'll send you a link to download the app."  


  
That's a bit random, I thought to myself, before completely forgetting about it, for the rest of the day.  


  
That is, until my wife, Lindsay, came home from work.  


  
"I got a random text today." She told me, tossing her jacket on the coat rack, and taking a seat at the kitchen table.  


  
"Text?" I replied, my brain still thawing out from a long day of crunching numbers.  


  
"Yeah. Something about a game?"  


  
"Oh, that? Shit, I completely forgot about it. Yeah I got it too. What's the deal with it?"  


  
"Honestly, I’m not sure. I tried to search for it online, but nothing came up."  


  
"Maybe it's a cover up." I joked.  


  
"Funny. But seriously, don't they have better things to focus on, like crime, or infrastructure?"  


  
"Fair point..." I replied, before giving my wife a cheeky smile, "...Should we play it?"  


  
"What? No! I'm not wasting my time on that."  


  
"Well, I am."  


  
"Wait. Why?"  


  
"Why not?  


  
"I'm all set."  


  
"Come on, let's do it together. It could be funny."  


  
My wife looked away...  


  
...Before finally dropping her shoulders, looking back at me, and giving in. "Alright, fine. But if it's for kids, or creepy, or both, I'm deleting it immediately."  


  
And like that, we both replied YES to the text.  


  
To which it replied:  


  
"Thanks for opting into the Census Game. Download the app using this link and verify your identity to complete your enrollment."  


  
And so, we did just that, each of us clicking the link in the text on our respective phones, downloading the app, and opening it.  


  
To which it welcomed us:  


  
"Welcome to the Census Game! Please verify your identity."  


  
We then each filled out a number of personal questions, including our names and addresses, before finally hitting the "Submit" button.  


  
To which it replied:  


  
"Congratulations! You have successfully enrolled in the Census Game. Every night at midnight, the players for that day will be chosen at random, and notified via a push notification on their phones. Should you get selected, simply follow the directions in the notification. Please note: The game will last exactly one month from today. If you aren't picked to play during that time, you're automatically safe from the game."  


  
“Safe? That’s a weird typo. Maybe they’re trying to be funny.” I said, before tossing my phone on the kitchen table, and hopping up to make dinner.  


  
"But what do you think happens when you get selected?" She asked, still dwelling on it.  


  
"I don't know, you play the game? Trivia maybe? What's the population of the greater metro area? Something like that?"  


  
"Hmm." It was clear that she was skeptical, and rightfully so.  


  
But within an hour, we were catching up on our work days over dinner, and had already forgotten about it.  


  
That is, until later that night, when the clock struck midnight.  


  
Lindsay was already passed out in bed beside me, when I heard my phone buzz again.  


  
Sure enough, I got a push notification:  


  
"Better luck next time! Unfortunately, you weren't selected to play the Census Game today. Look out for tomorrow's notification at midnight, for another chance to play."  


  
I looked over at my wife, fast asleep, her phone still clenched in her hand, and saw that she had received the same message:  


  
"Better luck next time! Unfortunately, you weren't selected to play the Census Game today. Look out for tomorrow's notification at midnight, for another chance to play."  


  
*Bummer*. I thought to myself, before turning off the lights. *Was really hoping we'd both get to see where they're going with this.*  


  
And that's when...  


  
...It happened for the first time.  


  
Suddenly, outside our apartment window, I heard a loud commotion, as a few people started coming out of their homes, calling out to each other.  


  
"Did it choose you?" One person called out.  


  
"Yeah, you?" Another replied.  


  
"Yeah."  


  
I sat up in my bed, listening curiously, confused by what was going on.  


  
"Please take me with you!" One of them pleaded with another. "I don't have a car."  


  
"Sorry buddy, I don't know you. I gotta look out for myself." Another replied.  


  
"Please!"  


  
And then… I heard the sound of a car speeding off.  


  
I walked over to the window and looked down at the street, to see a few people scurrying off in different directions.  


  
*Where are they all off to so late in the night?* I wondered.  


  
"Honey. What was that noise?" Lindsay asked, awoken from her slumbers.  


  
"Um... I'm not exactly sure. Don't worry about it, dear." I assured her, as she went back to bed.  


  
I tried to follow suit, but there was just something about what I'd heard, that wasn't sitting right with me.  


  
I tossed and turned that night, eventually falling asleep.  


  
The next morning, I turned on the TV, and lowered the volume, so as to not wake my wife, who was still sleeping.  


  
Sure enough, a reporter was commenting on the very situation I had overheard:  


  
"Good morning. I'm reporting live from downtown, where sources are saying, some residents left their homes in the middle of the night last night, fleeing the city, while others, simply disappeared. From the few witnesses we were able to speak to, we're hearing that there may be a correlation between the bizarre events, and a text that went out to residents yesterday, about a game. Meanwhile, the mayor's office, has yet to comment."  


  
I looked over at Lindsay, only to find her sitting back up in bed, eyes glued to the TV.  


  
Then she looked over at me, and the two of us, without saying anything, both grabbed our phones and began to search social media, for any clues as to what was going on.  


  
At first, I actually found a screenshot of the app, posted online from someone who had been selected:  


  
"Congratulations. You've been selected to play the Census Game. Beginning now, you have thirty minutes to leave the city. Should you fail to evacuate in the allotted time, or are caught in the process, you will be promptly eliminated from the game. Please note: In an effort to make the game fair, we have stationed guards at all roads, bridges, airports, and train tracks leading in and out of the metropolitan area. We wish you the best of luck, and thank you for playing."  


  
But when I tried to show the screenshot to my wife, it had already been removed.  


  
Lindsay immediately called out sick from work, and we spent the better part of the day, scouring the internet for information and debating what was going on, while at the same time, dreading the next push notification that would come that night.  


  
But when the clock finally struck midnight, we both received the same message as the night before:  


  
"Better luck next time. Unfortunately you weren't selected to play the Census Game today. Check back here tomorrow at midnight for another chance to play."  


  
And, just like the day before, not long after receiving the notification, I heard a commotion on the street below, followed by the sounds of footsteps and cars driving away.  


  
But this time, another noise followed, about twenty minutes later.  


  
It was the sound of vehicles racing down the street, as if in pursuit of... something, before screeching to a halt.  


  
But before I could get to the window to see what was going on, I heard the sound of screams, followed by doors slamming, and vehicles driving off.  


  
The next morning, I told Lindsay what I'd seen. We were once again safe, for at least  another twenty-four hours.  


  
Knowing that either of us, or both, could get chosen any day, we resolved to come up with a plan, just in case it happened, mapping out an escape route from the city, and packing backpacks with supplies.  


  
And so, each day, we woke up fearing the midnight notification, and each day, we were relieved to receive the same message:  


  
"Better luck next time. Unfortunately you weren't selected to play the Census Game today. Check back here tomorrow at midnight for another chance to play."  


  
Remembering the app's note about the game only lasting one month, we started crossing off each day in the calendar after receiving that message, and counting down the days to safety.  


  
Until, of course, the very last day of the month, when, at the stroke of midnight, my wife received a new notification, worded exactly as we had seen it online:  


  
"Congratulations. You've been selected to play the Census Game. Beginning now, you have thirty minutes to leave the city. Should you fail to evacuate in the allotted time, or are caught in the process, you will be promptly eliminated from the game. Please note: In an effort to make the game fair, we have stationed guards at all roads, bridges, airports, and train tracks leading in and out of the metropolitan area. We wish you the best of luck, and thank you for playing."  


  
As Lindsay read it, I saw her once hopeful eyes become fearful, and her once dry cheeks become covered in tears, before she looked over at me, as though asking me if I, too, had been selected to play the game.  


  
But when I looked down at my phone, I saw the same message that I'd been receiving since the beginning:  


  
"Better luck next time. Unfortunately you weren't selected to play the Census Game today. Check back here tomorrow at midnight for another chance to play."  


  
And that's when I realized... that only my wife had been selected to play the game.  


  
Nevertheless, just like any loyal husband would do, I chose to go with her, grabbing the backpacks that we had preemptively packed away for this very occasion, and opening the window that led to the fire escape.
