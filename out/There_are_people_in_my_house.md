They say your home is the safest place in the world. That when all else fails, you can retreat to your own personal sanctuary to relax and be alone. I don’t know if I wish I were alone right now.

I live in a pretty safe neighborhood. It’s the kind of place where people only “live” there so they can commute into the city for work. What I mean to say is that it’s not the kind of place anyone thinks about as a home. There’s nothing special about mine or anyone else’s on the block. It’s not even particularly nice. They’re just houses. Despite that, I like to think that I rose above this. I won’t say that you could hire me to decorate a home, but I’ve watched my fair share of home renovation shows. And after living here for almost my entire life, I think I’ve brought my very own charm to the place. I will admit, it had a lot more of that warmth when my kids still lived with me.  Most recently my daughter Emily had moved away to a college out of state, to pursue a Bachelor of Arts. Still, I had lived alone previously, and I didn’t mind too much. It’s just unfamiliar to be alone after so long. So that’s how I know, despite what the police say. I don’t feel alone.

It started about two weeks ago, regular as anything else. I had been lying in my bed reading a book when I heard a noise somewhere else in the house. Just some creaking floorboards. If I had been as paranoid as I am right now, I would have immediately thought of someone walking across the hardwood. But I chalked it up to the house settling and went to bed. That had to have been the first instance. Or maybe it was just the first time I noticed it. I mean the house had made noises before, but it couldn’t have been happening that long without me knowing. When I woke up the next morning, I had completely forgotten about the night previously before I noticed a notification on my phone from my home security system. My daughter had pushed for me to install something now that I was living alone, and I had relented but it hadn’t been very useful so far. However, now the phone said something I had never read before: \[Someone is Outside 2:17 am\].

I immediately clicked on it to see what had happened, that maybe something had fallen in the night or one of my neighbors had come home late. The thirty seconds of footage was from one of my cameras pointing into my backyard and it was dark. I didn’t see anything obvious, so I chalked it up to a glitch and moved on with my day. The next night morning though, the same thing happened. I woke up to another notification saying \[Someone is Outside 1:42 am\]. Again, there was nothing evident on the short slip of footage that the app had saved so I thought that maybe my security system was glitched.

This continued for another week before anything changed. After waking up to another \[Someone is Outside\] every morning, I had stopped checking the recordings. If the system was not going to record anything anyway, what was the point of even checking? I was debating even getting rid of the system and replacing it completely when I noticed something off in my kitchen. The door was open ever so slightly, the wind brushing the curtains gently. If I hadn’t not touched that door in over two months, I probably wouldn’t have even realized it. I locked the door quickly and went to my phone to check the notification from last night: \[Someone is Outside 3:13 am\].

The video was almost the same as the others, a dark view of my backyard save for the dim light of the lamp in my living room that I had forgotten to turn off last night. That slight change revealed everything though. The app was right, there was someone outside. Not just someone, but hundreds of people. All pushed close to each other to fit as many of them into my backyard as possible. They all were wearing different variations of the same outfit, a hoodie, and a pair of jeans. Some of them might have been wearing jackets instead. But all the clothes were dark and covered most of their body, all except their face. You know, despite this all I might’ve preferred that they were wearing masks. Horror movies prepare you for masks.

They all looked directly into the camera. They weren’t smiling or talking, they just stood there staring. Staring with those eyes. There wasn’t that effect you find on dark cameras, the red eyes you see when someone takes a flash photograph of you, or the reflection you get on a security feed. All the eyes were dark, dead. Then, the footage ended. I quickly went back through all the other saved footage and at first it looked like last night was a one-time occurrence. But I double-checked and upped the exposure of some of the frames. The first night there was only one person, tucked away at the back of my fence in nothing but a hoodie and jeans. Every single night after though, more people seemingly flooded into my backyard. They never moved and tried to stay as far away from my house as possible.

Obviously, I called the police, I told them that I was being stalked or harassed and that people had broken into my house. They searched every inch of my house and couldn’t find a single thing stolen or moved. There wasn’t a single sign of a break-in other than the open sliding glass door that I had shut. When I tried to show them what the cameras had recorded, they said they couldn’t see anything but that I could call them if anything else happened. The look the officer gave me when he said that almost felt like the kind of pity you give someone losing your mind.  
I couldn’t sleep that night. All night, I could hear floorboards creaking and pipes moving. Even though I had locked the door to my bedroom, I felt like there was something in the walls and ceiling from every side of me. People shimmying through tight spaces and pushing up against each other. I even thought for a second that it might just be the house settling, but I was awake when the notification came this time.

\[Someone is Inside 2:57 am\]. 

When I clicked the notification to see what the app had recorded it was just a black screen. But the audio had picked something up. It sounded like hundreds of bodies moving against each other, each trying to fit inside some small space. The bones breaking and skin ripping as the bodies squeezed themselves between each other was the only thing for those thirty seconds. The police never found anything inside my house when I called them again. They set up someone outside in case someone tries to break in, but I don’t need them outside. It’s the fact that they’re on the inside.

I don’t know if I’d want another person in here though, I worry that it’s becoming too full. The videos are dark still and I don’t know which camera is recording them. I only have cameras outside my house. The walls are bulging now, and I don’t know what to do. I have nowhere else to go and I wish I were all [alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/CursesAndBoons/comments/180iwt6/welcome_to_cursesandboons/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
