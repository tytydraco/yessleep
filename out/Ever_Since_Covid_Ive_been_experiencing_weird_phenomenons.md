Ever since Covid I’ve been experiencing very weird phenomenons Part 1

At the start of covid I started smoking green more often in the sun around that type of time people kept saying it was releasing solar flares and what not ( this is gonna be important later on ) One time while I was high with my ex girlfriend a TikTok was playing of the news and my tv was playing the Blacklist . I used to never even listen to anything while I was above the clouds. I suddenly felt my brain “turn on” and the two audios felt one message I couldn’t decipher . In my brain I  started to feel multiple signals moving around on the left and right side of my brain moving in a circular motion. I got up and started becoming paranoid . I got up out of bed and asked my girl at the time if she’s feeling what I’m feeling. She looked up from her phone confused and looked back down and said no . Shorty after I could hear silence. It was so loud it felt like other people who weren’t on earth were listening. That though could have been just me experiencing a high . I later came across a TikTok that asked “ who is that voice that speaks back to you in your head when you say hello” I asked my head this question while I was faded and started talking to myself a lot. I’d forget what I talked about between myself but I’d do a lot. 

Sometime in December of the covid year me and my ex did tantric meditation with spiritual music and our whole body lifted I went to a different state . Nothing would imply anything out of ordinary. After that year I began to meditate a lot using 1-10 count breathe in hold then out method. I did this on smelly spinach and I got crazy results. I seen the Big Bang on the trip it showed that it happened 3 times . Just to make the earth tho. I didn’t tell anyone cuz a lot of folks would be jealous of the trip( I posted it online) but it did scare me. Later down the year of 2021 I got arrested and got locked up for a few months due to destruction of property. Now while in jail I would meditate intensely. At one point my body during the meditation would take over and move my hands in different positions. It would go from the totem poles to the bhudda arms in various ways. I’d release an intense amount of energy and the air around me would feel tight. I’d be able to do this consistently almost every day. 

One day in my cell before my 21st bday tho it felt like a snake had bit my balls while meditating . It crawled up to spine and to my neck. Later on in the afternoon that snake like thing dug into my head then into my brain. Now during the night my body felt like someone grabbed it and started having full on sex with me. I couldn’t explain to you my fear. I’d physically feel the feeling of a woman on my member and have a prostate orgasm. (It felt like I was with my ex we had broken up before my arrest). 3 months later I would be home. I got some grass got and played some music. This time around. My body would respond to the music instantly I’d feel my brain Turing on again as if I was connecting to the internet. All of a sudden I felt like I was doing the same thing as several other people . Like I could sense them. Every now and then I’d play music at night high and dance in the bathroom it felt like a lot of people was dancing the same way with me at the same time. Pt.2 next
