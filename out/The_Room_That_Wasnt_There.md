You ever notice something in your house that… wasn’t? A corner that feels colder. A shadow that bends wrong. Maybe a door you swear didn’t used to be there.

Mine appeared on a Tuesday.

I live in a two-bedroom apartment. One bedroom, one office. Always been that way. I work from home, no pets, no guests. Just me. But when I walked past the hallway that afternoon, there it was: a door on the left wall. Same color, same handle. Perfectly normal. Only problem? That wall’s *never* had a door.

I stood frozen. Just stared. I even took out my phone to check old pictures. Wall’s empty in every single one.

So obviously I did the stupid thing: I opened it.

It was a room. Small. Empty. Dustless. Windowless. The air was warm, still. The floorboards were the same as the rest of the apartment, but… newer? Like freshly installed. The ceiling light flicked on automatically, humming softly.

I stepped inside. Just for a second.

When I stepped out again, it was night.

I checked my phone: *3:42 a.m.*

I’d lost over ten hours.

I tried to convince myself I fell asleep, blacked out, whatever. But the next morning, the room was still there. And something was in it.

A *chair*.

Not like one I own. This one was old. Victorian maybe. Ornate carvings. Crimson velvet, worn down to threads in spots. And on the chair—*a single Polaroid*.

It was of me. Standing in the room. But I never took that photo.

I slammed the door shut, locked it, pushed a bookshelf in front of it. I didn’t sleep.

The next morning, I pushed the shelf aside.

The room had changed.

Now there were *three* Polaroids. Me sitting. Me looking up in confusion. And the third—*me screaming*.

Over the next week, the room *grew*.

Slowly. By inches. A side table one day. A coat rack the next. Every day, something was different. The lightbulb began to flicker. The air smelled like rotting wood. The photos multiplied.

But I never went in again.

I started hearing things at night. Shuffling. A soft, dragging noise—like something pacing in a circle. One night, I heard humming. A lullaby I couldn’t place.

And then, the photos started appearing *outside* the room.

In my fridge. My coat pocket. My shoe.

One was pinned to my pillow:  
**Me. Sleeping.**  
Shot from above.

I called my landlord. I asked about previous tenants. He hesitated before saying:  
“You’re in 3B, right?”  
“Yeah.”  
He paused again.  
“There is no 3B.”

I thought he was messing with me—until I went outside.

The building has *no third floor.*

I live on the second floor. And the apartment above me is *gone.*

It’s just roof.

I ran back inside. My hall was longer than I remembered. The door to the room was now *the only* door.

My bedroom? Gone. Office? Gone.

Just… the door.

And the chair. And the photos.

Hundreds now. Thousands maybe. Piled on the floor, pinned to the walls, floating in the air. All of me. Dozens of angles. All expressions.

Some I don’t remember making.

Some... I know I *never* made.

Some photos are of me sleeping in places I’ve never been. One shows me with my eyes *stitched shut*. One shows me hanging from the ceiling.

One shows me holding a camera, smiling.

And now?

Now there's a mirror.

It wasn't there before.

And in that mirror—I just saw myself stand up from the chair.

But I haven't moved.

**I don't think I ever left the room.**

I think it’s been watching me *pretend* to.

I think it’s learning.

I think it's almost ready to *take my place.*

So if you ever notice a new door in your house…

Don’t open it.

Please.

Don't let it out.
