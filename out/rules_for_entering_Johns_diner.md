Rule 7  there is no rule :) if you follow rule :) you won't survive since John loves the number :) c'mon were waiting for you 

As I toss the strange invitation aside, thinking it must be a prank, I notice that it offers a 50 percent off discount. I'm short on money and I'm not sure if the invitation is a joke or not If it is I would probably get some laughs out of it I decide to give it a try. 

I grab my phone and text my friends to see if they want to come with me to this new restaurant. After a few minutes of back and forth, they agree to come with me and we decide to meet up at the address listed on the invitation in 20 minutes. 

I spend the next few minutes getting ready and trying to find out more about this mysterious place. As the time passes, I start to feel a mix of excitement and skepticism about the dinner invite. I hope that it's not a scam and that we'll have a good time at this restaurant.
