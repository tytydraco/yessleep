My name is Ted, and I know some of you will call bullshit on this, but I'm the most haunted man in the world. You know that kid from The Sixth Sense? I'd probably kill to be that lucky little bastard - the worst thing that happened to him was his therapist turning out to be a little more spooky than it first appeared.

Man, I'd kill for my life to have only been movie-level messed up. I have been haunted for as long as I can remember. I don't just see dead people - I live my life under psychological assault from them more or less 24/7, and have done ever since I can remember pretty much. I know why too, although I didn't learn that until I was an adult. Way too late, since it was after Sarah… yeah. We'll get to that though.

My earliest memory of a ghostly encounter was when I was just five years old. I unfortunately remember the day like it was yesterday. It's been years since it happened, but the memory is still crystal clear in my mind. I can still recall playing with my toys in my room, the feel of them in my hands, the sounds of Mom sobbing leaking through the floor from the living room below (it was just after everything came out about Dad, you see). I can picture it - the shining rays of sun piercing through the window from the normalcy beyond the glass, everything so peaceful to me despite the familial implosion playing out below. Thing is, the peace of a happy home wasn't the only thing about to be shattered.

I'd just finished stacking the last of my blocks when suddenly, out of nowhere, I saw her. The ghost of a little girl, standing there in the middle of my room. There was no warning, no sudden drop in temperature or ethereal hissing sound. The lights didn't dim, the sun from outside never faltered. Hell, the drapes didn't even flutter. I screamed of course. One minute I was alone, the next there was an obviously dead girl in the room with me. Had Mom not been dividing her attention between her third bottle of wine and burning photos of Dad, she'd probably have come up to investigate. 

She didn't though. Nobody came to the rescue, a feeling I'd soon get used to. The girl who'd appeared was harrowing to my young mind, even without the context of adulthood and all the knowledge of just what man is capable of that comes with it. She was so small, so fragile-looking even to my tiny child self - like a porcelain doll that had been shattered and put back together, her clammy blueish skin lined with an irregular web of dark swollen veins. It was her eyes that haunted me most though.

Everything I needed to know about the girl was in those eyes. A far clearer picture of her fate than the swollen crack on her forehead or handprints on her neck could ever paint. They were so sad, so full of pain, that I couldn't look away. They seemed to be pleading with me, begging me to help her. Her hair was soaking wet, and water was dripping from it onto the floor. It was as if she had just come out of the bath, but one she'd been in far too long judging by the excessive pruning on her trembling fingers. Her clothes were soaked through as well, clinging to her tiny frame. It was as if she had drowned, and her body had been left to rot in the water.

I remember feeling a warmth in the seat of my pants. I wanted to run, but all I could manage after my initial scream was a soft whimpering. There was a smell coming off her, one my infant brain didn't yet know but would soon come to recognize and, well, let's just say it's a stench most morticians are familiar with. 

I almost passed out from sheer terror when she opened her mouth to shriek at me. Not because of the sound she made, but because she couldn't make any sound at all - because the only thing that flew from between her lips was a wet, slimy paste that reeked of rotting fish.

Thankfully (I think), she vanished into thin air before the fear could kill me, leaving nothing but the sound of dripping water echoing in my ears. I've seen so many of them since, so many I don't even remember all of them, but you never forget your first, right? Her image has stayed with me all these years, even though I only ever saw her again once. I wish some of the others had been as rare, let me tell you.

Mom didn't hold it together for much longer after I saw the drowned girl. Everything that happened with Dad took it out of her too much. I obviously didn't find out the full extent of exactly how heavy a burden that was for her until much later. It was Mom that told me, although she was only able to do so after decades in Saint Dionysus. For most of my life I simply believed he'd walked out on her and the prospect of raising me alone after years being a financially dependent housewife broke her.

I only had the chance to tell Mom about the girl once before I was reclaimed by social services and became a burden of the state so-to-speak. Mom didn't really register what I was telling her then, but I can't really hold it against her. She had more than enough going on, and I think if I was in her shoes I'd believe the shrinks saying my kid was making it up to cope with everything too.
 
You're probably thinking that's exactly what happened too, huh? I wish. Would be great if this was just PTSD. Thanks to Sarah and everything I've learned since the drowned girl showed up in my room though, I know this is all too real. My "hallucinations" are anything but.

From that first world-upending encounter in my childhood home, I have been haunted by hordes of different ghosts, far too many to count, and always multiple daily. It would be debilitating, but I'm smart. I saw what happened to Mom after Dad was gone, and I was determined not to wind up the same way. When I was a kid they put my "hallucinations" down to trauma from the breakdown of the home and ending up in care blah blah blah. I played along, pretending I'd stopped seeing "the scary people" when I realised "if the grown ups know I can see them they'll send me to a bad hospital like Mommy, but one that's even worse". So I kept quiet, telling only those I trusted like Sarah… and now you guys, I guess.

But yeah, the ghosts kept coming. I've honestly seen so many by this point that I'm numb to all but the most horrific. It's an odd thing, the human mind. Mine is so calloused to certain… erm… "types", I guess, of restless deceased. I don't even notice the scores of car crash victims with their limbs all twisted and faces mangled anymore, or the bald and listless cancer patients who shuffle slowly down the streets talking to themselves in soft sobs. Some of the dead though, the most tragic of their number, will live rent-free on the inside of my eyelids until I die myself and join them.

For a few months when I was eight or nine I was targeted by the spectre of a young woman with a slashed throat - her eyes bulging and bloodshot, her presence was suffocating. She would appear outside my window each evening, her ghostly form dripping with blood, staring up at my window while she absent mindedly pulled and picked at the ever-fresh wound in her neck.

Then there was the man with the shattered skull, half his cranium obliterated for what I'm guessing was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He would sit in the corner of my room, brains oozing out and dropping on the carpet with dull splats. Night after night when I was about 12 I'd bury myself in my pillow to try and drown out the creaking of him rocking back and forth. Every attempt to silence the incoherent muttering he made failed. I could never quite understand him, but the sound of his voice was like a sack full of kittens being hit with a sledgehammer.

And then there was the little boy with the broken neck, his head twisted at an unnatural angle. He would crawl across my ceiling, his ghostly limbs leaving bubbling handprints in the cheap plaster of the Marathon County orphanage architecture. I could hear his spine cracking with every movement, and it made me retch with disgust. I never knew what he wanted from me, but even when I'd ram my eyes shut and hide under the blankets I could feel his gaze like a weight around my soul, dragging me down into the depths of despair.

Each of these ghosts chipped away at my sanity, bit by bit. They wore me down, like a stone eroded by the relentless pounding of the waves. And I knew that there would be others, always others, waiting in the shadows to torment me. Thankfully, most of these aberrations only visited me over the course of a few months at most before growing bored with me as a victim. Some used to linger for much longer though. They were always the worst.

For example, there was the gazeless man who came to define my teenage years, the one whose twisted features still taint most of my memories of the time I spent in the Marathon County care system. He haunted me throughout my adolescence from the age of around fourteen, visiting me several times a week without fail until I was at least twenty three. And every time he appeared, my heart would race to the point of damn near bursting from my chest, just like I was five years old in that sunlit bedroom all over again. He was one of those that I was never prepared for, no matter how fucked up the ghosts I'd already seen that day were.

I still can't imagine the grotesque figure as a living human being. My mind just can't cogitate those empty eye sockets with their impossible stare once being full, once belonging to a soul with a body and life. The skin around them was torn and ragged, with marks and rough slices that were chillingly easy to attribute to human fingernails. The red rawness that was his face was covered in deep lacerations that oozed blood and pus, and his twisted, contorted features were frozen in a perpetual scream.

And oh, how he screamed. Every night, for hours on end, he would unleash a wordless howl that chilled me to the bone. It was a sound of pure agony and despair, and it echoed through my head long after he had vanished into the night. His presence was suffocating, and at one point he was singularly responsible for a lapse in resilience that made me feel like I was slowly losing my mind. I considered taking my own life on more than one occasion, just to escape his torment. Thankfully I had Sarah by then. If it wasn't for her then…

As I grew older, the longer-term ghosts became more frequent and more malevolent. There was the ghost of a crooked old woman who would emerge from the water near my feet whenever I ran a bath, beckoning me towards her with bony fingers before grabbing at my ankles. I learned pretty quick that baths weren't worth the risk, especially since I would wake up screaming and drenched in sweat for months after if she ever managed to touch me.

Then there was the summer when I was around 26 and the ghost of a teenage girl with her body raggedly missing from the navel down followed me around wherever I went. Literally everywhere - I'd wake up and go to sleep with her at the foot of my bed. I couldn't even go to the bathroom with her dragging herself along on her knuckles behind me. She never spoke, but whenever I made eye contact I could hear whispering in a language I couldn't quite recognize, right at the edge of my hearing. I learned to ignore her, but I could feel her watching me until she left, always waiting for me to let my guard down in a way I didn't quite understand. Then, one morning, I awoke to her milky eyes staring down at me, her nose inches from my own. I got a brief whiff of her putrid breath when - with no warning - she vanished, leaving me alone with soaked bed sheets and an uncomfortable muscular after-tension between my legs that I still have to try real hard not to dwell on.

I tried to ignore the ghosts, but they were always there, lurking in the shadows, waiting for me. In adulthood I sought help from psychologists and psychiatrists, but they couldn't explain what was happening to me. Sarah and I had read about shared hallucinations you see and, for obvious reasons, we felt it worth looking into. Anything to make it stop. We'd both half-hoped they'd leave us alone once we grew up, like it was a childhood specific thing, but that copium wore off quick. The shrinks diagnosed me with schizophrenia and gave me a bunch of pills to ram down my throat. The drugs didn't stop the visitations from beyond, but I can't lie, they helped Sarah and I both numb our emotional response to them for a good while, which was something at least.

After a year or two of being too whacked out of my eyeballs to have any kind of real emotional response to them, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of comfort from their presence. They were always with me, even when no one else was. They were my constant companions, and in a messed up way, the only consistency in my rollercoaster life. However, there is one that stands out as the most painful and devastating of all - but for you to understand, I need to tell you about my wife, about Sarah.

The day I met Sarah was the first time I have a conscious memory of being happy, as corny as that sounds. I was just a scared kid, fresh off the heels of my father's actions going public and my mother's breakdown. I was lost, alone, and terrified. But then I saw her, and everything changed.

Sarah was sitting alone in the orphanage courtyard, staring up at the sky with a look of wonder on her face. Or, at least, she was alone from the perspective of the rest of the shadowy children in the concrete playground. I was drawn to her, like a moth to a flame because I knew the truth. As I got closer, I realized she was talking to someone. Someone I'd met before, about a year before I found myself at the Marathon County orphanage - a small girl with dripping hair and handprints on her neck. The ghost who visited me the exact day the police found Dad 

I was too scared to speak at first, but Sarah looked up and met my eyes. And in that moment, I knew something special was happening. We both had the same connection to whatever awaited after death, and the fact that we could both see the same frail dripping spectre standing there amongst the living felt like an inexplicable miracle.

We spent hours talking that day, and every day after that. We were inseparable, two kids in a world that didn't understand us. We shared everything, our hopes, our fears, our dreams. And as we grew up together, I realized that I had fallen in love with her - and the only joy I can remember in all my years on Earth is the moment I learned she'd fallen in love with me too.

Our ability to see ghosts brought us closer than anything else could have. We could sense things that others couldn't, feel the presence of spirits around us. Being in each other's company was the only time we didn't feel alone, didn't feel like freaks. How could either of us ever have found anyone but each other? Sarah was the only person on the planet who understood my terror at the thought of the screaming eyeless man, because every time she'd sneak into my room in the Orphanage (or if I'd sneak into hers) she'd have to endure him screaming too.

Unlike me, Sarah never knew who her parents were, and I could tell that it was a wound that never quite healed. She'd been dumped at the Marathon County Orphanage as a baby, the only identification left with her being the birthmark on her chest. She was more or less born alone, I was forced into loneliness by Mom and Dad, but Sarah and I had each other, and that was enough - at least for a while. We were like two halves of the same whole, destined to be together.

Now, as I sit here alone, haunted not only by spirits but the knowledge that a piece of me is missing. Sarah was the only one who could make me feel like I wasn't alone, and now she's gone - taken from me too soon by a fate that I can't begin to understand. It's not like I've got anyone to share my grief with, either. Turns out seeing the dead wasn't the only problem we had.
 
Turns out that being able to see the dead has implications when it comes to creating life. Big implications. Turns out prematurely opening the door at the end of life, even a little, shuts the other door entirely. We longed to have children together, but every time Sarah became pregnant, our unborn child would die. Always at the same time too - exactly a day before the due date. 

The first time it happened, we were devastated, but we put it down to the understandably-intense stress. When it happened again and again, we knew that something was wrong. Losing kids two and three was all the assurance we needed that our… condition, I guess, meant procreation was out of the question. The universe simply wouldn't allow it.

They came to her after the fourth was conceived, the one she was carrying when she… They would appear around her, you see, the three we lost, orbiting her like despairing mosquitos, crying and begging for her to save them, their twisted little faces dripping with eldritch slime as they howled…

They were still dancing around her body when the ambulance took her away.

The shrill tittering spewing from that trio of life-ended-prematurely almost broke me, despite my psyche being considerably tougher by my 30s. They did break Sarah. I found her one night slumped on my workbench in the garage, my power drill still whirring away the wet boney shrapnel from her temple. I lost without her, but not as lost as she herself became. I can't even take solace in fooling myself about Sarah's pain being over or some such bullshit, because even in death, she hasn't found peace. She comes to me now, just like the spirits we'd hold each other in the night to keep safe from as kids. 

I know what you're thinking - this doesn't have a Romeo and Juliet ending. This isn't that kind of note. I knew, have always known, that if I joined Sarah I would be trapped in a world of pain and despair worse somehow than the one I've known all my life. As the years went by, I learned to live with the ghost of Sarah. She would appear to me from time to time, but I've had to ignore her, to push her away, to convince myself she's just a manifestation of my grief and pain. 

I can't even bring myself to look at her as I'm writing this.

God, this is so fucked up. Why is this my fucking life?

Oh yeah.

Dad.

I mentioned that my first experience with the paranormal started when the truth about Dad came out. I never told you what truth, though. It's not something anyone wants to admit, and I didn't find out about him until just after Mom died.

Mom wasn't three bottles of wine deep at 10:00 AM that day because Dad had an affair, or walked out on her, or anything so mundane. No. Mom spent the rest of her life in a secure room at Saint Dionysus because her husband, and the father or her child, was the Marathon County Snatcher. You'd break too if you learned your spouse of eight years had abducted and killed over two dozen children.

Bet you're wondering what this has to do with the ghosts, huh? Well, his final victim came with unintended consequences, both for Dad and every male he'd ever sired or would sire, and any males they've sired or will sire, etc.

These kinds of things happen when you brutally kidnap, do unspeakable things to, then murder and dump the body of the teenage daughter of a local grocery store owner who - unbeknownst to anyone - is legitimately the herald of an unknowable dark entity, don't they?

Turns out that when you get an active serial killer and an active… whatever the fuck that cult was in the same town, shit will go sideways sooner or later. In this case, my life has been the sideways. My Dad was a sick fuck, and he picked his victims if he liked their eyes - so of coursen he'd been unable to resist the allure of peepers that sparkled with the intensity of a literal deity trapped within, even if he didn't know why. He probably didn't question it. She was just another victim to him.

As I said, sick fuck. He got what was coming to him though. He was in at least seven pieces when Sheriff Harwurst found his remains after they'd been dumped outside the station, according to Mom. Unfortunately, in addition to torturing Dad in ways so twisted the Police burned the Polaroids left with his body, the cult cursed his entire bloodline - including me.

It wasn't until Mon died when I was 45 that I learned the truth. I hadn't seen her since she was taken to Saint Dionysus, so long that they didn't even have contact details to reach me when the cancer took her. She appeared to me after death, explaining everything. She told me about the curse, the cult, Dad's darkness, about the unholy deity he'd unknowingly indulged his twisted urges on the vessel of…

As for how she knew, I wasn't the only one punished. Mom's torment wasn't in the world of the waking though. Hers came in her dreams, when the deity Dad had interfered with made her watch his crimes over and over, a punishment for her guilt by association.

I was shaken to my core. Everything suddenly made sense. But there was one missing piece of the puzzle - Sarah. She'd died long before Mom. I knew that we have to have shared the curse, that she also must have been connected in some way to this cult. With her gone I would never know the full truth. I could find out, but that would mean acknowledging her ghost isn't a figment of my imagination, and I'm just… I can't. Not yet.

Besides, for Sarah's ghost to talk it would have to stop weeping first, and it hasn't done that for 13 years.

I often wonder what might have been different if Sarah were still alive, if we could have uncovered the secrets of the curse together. Maybe even found a cure, or reversed it somehow. Sarah isn't still alive though, is she? She is gone, and I am left with only that which haunts me - and the ghosts.

I can't help but feel like a failure. For years, I've been obsessed with finding the cult. Of course I have - what else would I have done? I've spent countless hours poring over old police reports and scouring the internet for any hint of their existence. I even went so far as to hire a private investigator, but all to no avail. 

I've come close, so close, to uncovering their secrets. There have been times when I thought I had finally stumbled upon a lead, only to have the trail go cold. It's as if they know that I'm hunting them, and they're always one step ahead. I can't shake the feeling that they're watching me, that they know what I'm up to and are laughing at my feeble attempts to stop them.

There was one thing though, one tangible link that I've found in my years of fruitless search. About a year ago I stumbled upon a photo that made my blood run cold. A Polaroid from a long-forgotten police report. It was a picture of my father's final victim, the young girl who had been marked as the vessel for their dark god. And in that same photo, I saw something that made my heart sink. The symbol on her forehead was the same as the birthmark on Sarah's chest.

I couldn't breathe. My mind was racing, trying to process the implications of what I had just seen. Was it possible that Sarah had also been marked as a vessel? Was that why she too could see ghosts, why she too was cursed like me?

I tried to push the thought away, to tell myself that it was just a coincidence, that there was no way that the cult could have gotten to Sarah. But the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. The cult could have been searching for a vessel for years. What if Dad hadn't inadvertently ended their only attempt, merely their first successful one?

My greatest fear is that somewhere out there, the cult has Found another vessel, another innocent victim groomed to be the body for their dark god. That's not my problem though. My only problem is what happens once I've finished writing this, because once I'm done, I'm going to speak to Sarah for the first time in thirteen years, and I'll probably be joining her by the end of it. I'm sick of being haunted. Time to see how the other side lives.

Good luck.
