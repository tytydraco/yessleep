It felt like a dream. Honestly, it did.

Maybe it was a dream, maybe it wasn't, who knows?

I remember walking down a corridor in a museum. The walls, ceilings and the floor was white. The lights were powerful, too powerful. They were glaring down at me as if in a surgical room.

The museum was empty. I was all alone. There were many painting and statues lying here and there, but they seemed distorted somehow.

On a closer look, I realised that all the pictures were demonic. All the statues were of winged creatures, leering down at me, their eyes seemingly following me, as if judging me for every insecurity and demons that I kept inside my head.

The corridor was long, the end was lost in the distance. I kept walking, passing all the horrifying pieces of art that were kept on display.

As I walked nearer and nearer to the end, I could hear a sound, a buzzing, echoing across the walls.At the end was a door, the majestic kind that you see at theaters.

On entering I saw an auditorium, a huge one, with a big stage. There were curtains on either side, red velvet curtains, with golden borders.

The floor was covered with a soft mat, and here and there, among the black, blossomed stains of red, standing out to me.

The auditorium was filled with people.

Almost all the seats were occupied. Each and every seat had a holder who was staring transfixed at the stage. Everyone was quiet, except for the buzzing that was louder now.

I looked towards the stage, wondering what could hold the gaze of so many viewers, it must be something spectacular.

I took a seat.

And indeed, it was.

For this was no musical, nor was it a performance.

It was a statue.

A statue with yellow skin that was peeling off, bruises that were oozing blood, mangled hair, ruined makeup, a dress made up of rags, and a disgusting smell that was wafting all through the auditorium.

It looked exactly as if a dead body had been strung up for display for many weeks, until it was rotting. Its hair was falling in clumps everywhere, its hands fell limply by its side.

But still there something so pleasant about it, so mystifying......

It looked alive, yet so dead, It looked shy yet so pleasant.

It was stunning, a true work of art.

Suddenly, the lights went out, leaving everything to darkness. The night was more apparent then ever.  
The people around me, they seemed distorted, strange somehow, it was like they were there but at the same time, they weren't.

They were looking at it, still looking, it seemed as if they were somehow.....forced to look at it.

Was this a dream, was this reality?

Would I wake up and realize that it was nothing more than a story? A fiction?

But I couldn't stop myself, I had to look, I have to look......

Because if I don't, something terrible will happen......

Something terrible........
