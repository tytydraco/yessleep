  
I bought this house 8 months ago to be closer to my son and his mother. His mom and I don’t have a great relationship, we hardly speak, but I wanted to be nearby my son in case of an emergency and driving two hours out to this shitty bumblefuck town to pick him up every other week got old fast, so I bought the house.   
  
 I thought I got a good deal. 2-Bed, 2-bath on a decent amount of land with an old barn and a boarded-up well out back. If any of you have been trying to buy a house the past few years, you’ll know how competitive it is. In an idiotic attempt to impress the seller, I waived the inspection - **Never** waive the inspection.   
  
The house was falling apart. Foundation was crumbling. Termites in the subfloor. Leaky roof. Water damage because of the leaky roof. I was hemorrhaging cash just trying to get the place livable, but I was close to my son and the ever-growing to-do list kept me busy which was nice in a boring country town like this one.   
  
A few weeks went by and the house became livable enough for me to feel comfortable allowing Theo, my son, to spend the night in the new house. The time, money and effort I spent on this shitty little house were all worth in those short weekends that I had custody. We slid around the hardwood floors in our socks, played hide and seek in the dilapidated barn and at night we laid in the middle of the giant backyard and stared up the infinite number of stars in the dark rural sky as fireflies floated around us. He loved it, so I loved it.   
  
Eventually my to-do list arrived at “Fill-in the well”.   
  
I mean, what was I going to do with an old dried up well in the backyard? I’m not a farmer and I’m pretty sure the water isn’t safe to drink if there’s still water in there. The well added nothing but risk. What if Theo fell in while we were playing hide and seek?  
  
I approached the well for the first time since buying the house. It sat about 50 yards from the back from the house, behind the old barn. It was a small ring of gray stone that rose about 3 feet out of the earth around it. It was covered with a rotting plywood lid on top of which stood a pile of dirt and stones to weigh it down.   
  
I never should have opened taken the lid off of the damn thing.   
  
I pushed the stones off the side and pulled the plywood off the stone opening of the well. I peered over the side and immediately felt a jolt of cold lightning shoot through my body as I saw a shadowy face staring back up at me from the bottom.  
  
A moment passed before I realized it was my own face staring back up at me reflected off of the black water at the bottom of the old well. I had been expecting the well to be dry by how old it looked. I guessed it had to be at least 70 years old and the water table should have dropped by now.   
  
I took another long look down the well at the black water so far below. I realized I didn’t have the tools, or know-how to pull this job off and started to back away from the well when a few bubbles floated to the surface of the dark water. I watched as the bubbles dissipated and the surface of the water returned to its smooth mirror-like stillness.   
  
A few days after I pulled the lid off that well my tools went missing. I kept them in the barn out back and couldn’t find them when I went out back to grab a handsaw. I chalked that one up to me being a bit too trusting of my new country neighbors, I figured crime wasn’t just a city-issue after all. I spent what little money I had on some new tools, and a padlock for the barn.   
  
A few weeks later the padlock was missing along with my new tools. This time I called the police, who couldn’t do much to help me other than file a report.   
  
I couldn’t afford new tools; I was barely keeping my head above water with house payments and I spent most of my savings on home improvements. That’s what I get for buying a house when interest rates are through the roof, I guess.  
  
The next thing to go missing was my son’s bike. We usually left it propped up on the side of the house, but one morning I woke up and it was gone. This really pissed me off. For the next few nights, I stayed up late peeking out of windows with my phone in-hand ready to call the police.   
  
I saw it for the first time a little after 3am. I heard footsteps in my backyard and I crept towards the rear of the house and looked out the window. I saw the black outline of a man obscured by shadow as he slipped into my now unlocked barn. I moment later I saw him re-emerge from the barn dragging the only two tools I had left in there – my shovel and a sledgehammer.   
  
I picked up the phone to call 911 when the man did something strange. He walked over to the well and tossed the shovel down the well shaft. I put down the phone and watched the man curiously as he heaved the sledgehammer up over his shoulder then tossed it down the shaft as well.   
  
I stood there watching the man, furious. Getting stolen from is one thing, but for someone to take your things only to destroy them – that was frustrating. Especially since I didn’t know anyone in the area. Who would do that to me?   
  
I got ahold of my anger and started to dial when I saw the man sit himself on the stone lip of the well, then without warning or hesitation fall backwards into the well shaft. Instinctively, I rushed to help the man, grabbing a flashlight on my way out of the house.     
  
I reached the well and called out to the man before shining a beam of light down the deep abyss only to see the light reflected off of smooth, black water.   
  
I phoned the police who arrived 15 minutes later. I told them the story and within an hour they had jerry-rigged a ramshackle pulley system and were lowering someone from the rescue team down into the well.   
  
I’ll spare you the details, but they found nothing. No shovel, no sledgehammer and no body. In addition to that, I got slapped with a hefty fine for abusing emergency services, but I know what I saw. Thank God Theo wasn’t staying with me that night.   
  
Things kept going missing. I wasn’t sleeping. I’d stay awake for days at a time watching my property, only to eventually doze off. I’d wake up the next morning with my garden hose and windchimes missing.   
  
One morning, I woke up to find two of tires had gone missing off of my truck. I lost my job the morning of the truck incident. My performance had been slipping and me not showing up to work that day was the final nail in the coffin. As if I wasn’t stressed enough.   
  
The one thing that kept me sane was Theo. I craved the weekends he stayed with me, but I was even failing in that category. I was too stressed to laugh at his jokes and too tired to play games. Once while playing hide-and-seek, he told me to sit on the couch and count to 100 before going looking for him. I fell asleep before I got to 30. That one ruined the entire weekend. I felt like such a shit dad.   
  
I was burning through what little savings I had and decided I needed to sell the house. Too bad no one wants an overpriced fixer-upper in this market. Especially not in this town. I was trapped. I felt like I was suffocating under the weight of my own life. I tried to live simply, I *had* a good job I didn’t lavish my son with the gifts he deserved and still I felt like I was getting priced out of just, existing.   
  
I made up my mind. No more worrying about the Well-man. I’d go to sleep early, send out a constant stream of resumes from 8am until 5pm, and I would make an effort to make Theo’s weekends at my house as much fun as possible for him. I was going to re-invent myself. Turn a tragedy into an opportunity. Take control of my life.   
  
I woke up that night to a loud boom.   
  
I slowly rose from bed, thinking Theo had just knocked a chair over trying to get to the cookies on the top of the fridge like he had so many times in the past. I sat there at the foot of my bed and took a moment to fully wake up so I could coherently parent. It had been a while since I had gotten a full night of sleep, I was exhausted. I looked at the clock and saw a big red 03:16 shining back at me.    
I walked out of my bedroom and was confronted by a scene that turned my blood cold. The front door had been kicked in. Splinters of wood were strewn across the living room and I saw through the open door, large, wet footprints that led up the porch, into the house, and down the hallway into Theo’s room.   
  
Quickly but silently, I grabbed a kitchen knife and tracked the footprints to Theo’s room and pushed the door open.   
  
Theo was lying in bed, still asleep but without covers. His blanket was missing along with some of the stuffed animals he usually cuddles with. I quickly re-traced the footsteps back outside just in time to see the black silhouette of a man toss an armful of blankets down into the well before jumping in after them.   
  
I went back into the house, barricaded the door, put another blanket on my son and waited for the sun to rise.   
  
When Theo’s mom came to pick him up the next day, I told her that Theo wouldn’t be able to stay with me for a few months. I would be travelling for work then the house would be getting an extensive remodel and it wouldn’t be safe for him to be here with all of the power tools, exposed wires and nails. She was more than happy to take him away from me and didn’t ask any questions. Like I said, we don’t have a good relationship.   
  
Saying goodbye to Theo was tough, but he didn’t understand what was happening. He just asked if we could camp in the barn when he came back. I agreed.   
  
My plans to reinvent myself were put on an indefinite hold. I was back to obsessing over the Well-Man. How could I not? He just broke into my home and took the covers off of my sleeping child. Play-time was over.   
  
As soon as Theo and his mom pulled out of the driveway I marched over to the well and covered it with the plywood lid that had previously capped it. I spent 2 full hours searching for large rocks to weigh the lid down with. The lid bowed under a mountain of rocks by the time I was done.  
With that taken care of, I went to work fixing my front door. I couldn’t afford a repair man or any materials, but I managed to get it fixed up well enough to have it be able to lock again, not that it really helped that much.   
  
Exhausted, I fell asleep early that night.   
  
A week passed without incident. I started a job search, but I was still short on funds so I started selling off some possessions to help pay the mortgage. My collection of Silver Dollars was enough to pay the mortgage for a month but bills were stacking up – Internet, electricity, gas, trash, water. I sold some kitchen appliances and my Xbox to help pay for those. I walked into town and started passing out my resumes at restaurants and local hardware stores in an attempt to secure some sort of income no matter how meager.   
  
I finally landed a gig at a Honey-Baked Ham shop in the back preparing food. $10 an hour for 30 hours a week. It would cover a good portion, but not all of my mortgage. It would have to do.   
  
It was back breaking work. 6 hours a day of carving up ham legs. Sawing through femur bones in a blazing hot kitchen, but it bought me time to find another job. I could also sneak some food out every now and then so I wouldn’t have to worry about dinner. By the time I got home every night I was wiped out and covered in meat juice and bone marrow. I’d shower and immediately pass out.   
  
I was so tired I didn’t even wake up the next time that thing came into my house. I woke up in the morning to again find my front door kicked in and the same watery footsteps charting a path from the front porch and into my living room. This time it took my television.   
  
I walked out into the backyard and found the lid I had placed on the well had been pushed over. I flew into a rage. What was this thing? Was I going crazy? This had to stop. I couldn’t just wait for this thing to clean me out.  
  
I walked back into town and went to a hardware store where I had just tried to get a job a few days before. I bought a sledgehammer on credit and dragged it all the way back to my house where I took to dismantling the well.   
  
I hammered the side of that well with the sledgehammer for nearly 30 minutes before I realized I wasn’t making any progress. No matter how hard I hit it, that small circle of stone stayed intact. I couldn’t even find a place where I had chipped one of the stones. Defeated, I dropped the sledgehammer on the ground where I stood and went to go get ready for work.   
  
The sledgehammer was gone when I woke up the next day.   
  
I started getting paranoid again. I felt like a rat in a maze, or more accurately, like Theseus in King Minos’ labyrinth – lost, afraid, and knowing that trapped in here with me is a monster that I’ll have to battle in order to survive.   
  
I kept grinding at work and I kept selling off more possessions to survive. Golf clubs, microwave, extra linens, love seat, my now empty TV stand were all sold to help cover bills.   
  
It wasn’t long before the house was nearly empty. I still had a refrigerator, a simple wooden chair and a few pots and pans. My bedroom consisted wholly of a mattress on the ground with my clean clothes stacked neatly in one corner of the room and my dirty clothes thrown in a pile in another corner.   
If I didn’t get an offer on the house or a better job soon, I’d run out of cash within two months. Things were desperate.   
  
One night as I lay in bed thinking about how badly I’d fucked my life up I heard it. Heavy footsteps paced around the outside of my house accompanied by a low groaning that was just barely audible.   
I sat up in bed and strained my ears to listen. The footsteps circled my small house once, then I heard two heavy footfalls on the front porch. It was here. I left my bedroom and stood in the foyer, frying pan in-hand, ready to launch an attack at the thing that had ruined my life as soon as it walked in.   
The wet footfalls continued up the porch and stopped at the front door which now, due to extensive damage, was not able to lock.   
  
I stood in silence and held my breath having no clue what to expect to see walk through my front door in a matter of seconds. I had seen it before, it had the shape of a man, but I couldn’t never see more than its silhouette and I knew whatever was about to walk in my home was no man. I raised the frying pan above my head in anticipation.   
  
The door creaked as it slowly swung open. Standing in my door was a man. He was still silhouetted against the porch light but it was the best view of him I had seen so far. He was dripping wet and caked with mud. His ghost-white skin was swollen and was dotted with large black patches of decomposition. His clothes had deteriorated to rags. His lips and the tips of his fingers were blue as if he was hypothermic. He stared at me with dead milky eyes.   
  
I froze. My plan of attack evaporated before it had even started. I was expecting to see something mystical, otherworldly, impossible, but expecting to see something and actually seeing something are two totally different things. You never know how you might react when a dead man walks into your foyer.  
  
The dead man took a wet squishy step into my home, then another. It was then I finally managed to break free from my stupor and rushed at the dead man with the frying pan. I swung down on the man’s head intending to cave it in. A wet, clammy hand rushed to meet mine and he caught me by the wrist. The man’s other hand grabbed me by the throat and lifted me off my feet.   
  
That’s all I remember.   
  
I woke up the next morning with a blinding headache on the floor of the foyer. The door was still wide open. My house was empty. It took everything it could find. No mattress, chair, fridge, clothes, nothing. Even the shower curtain was missing. All I have left is the phone I’m writing this on. I don’t even have the charger.  
  
That was three days ago.   
  
Do you know why we throw coins into wishing wells? Ask anyone and you’ll get a different answer. Sometimes they’ll tell you it’s because fairies live there, sometimes it’s a show of respect for the value of the life-giving resource of water, but I know the real reason. It’s an offering - tribute. A payment to keep whatever is down there from crawling back up and taking it from you. I realize this now. Pity it’s too late for me to do anything about it. I have nothing left to keep the beast at bay.  
  
It’s inside my house now. I can see its shadow under the crack of my bedroom door. With any luck it will just take my phone, but I have a feeling it wants more. Its already taken everything from me. If any of you read this, send a couple prayers up for Theo. I’m sorry we won’t get to camp in the barn.   
  
A funny thought just came to me – I have life insurance. I’m technically worth more dead than alive.   
  
Good bye.
