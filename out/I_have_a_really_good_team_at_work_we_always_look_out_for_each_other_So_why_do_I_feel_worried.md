I have to hand it to Jenny, she was the first to notice what was going on with Tyler. She came to speak to me about it, privately, after a meeting last week.

'I'm worried about him,' she confided. 'He's had such a rough time lately.'

I have to admit I had not given it too much thought, as his work output had not significantly deteriorated, either in quality or quantity. But as she talked I saw the seriousness of the situation. Tyler had been going through a bad break-up, there was illness in his family, and he himself had been in an auto accident just last month. Not any serious injuries, or anything, but enough to shake him up, and his car had been a write-off. All this shit happening at once was enough to unsettle anyone.

'You really think - he's cracking up?' I asked cautiously. 

She looked back over her shoulder as if she was afraid of being overheard. 'I *know* he is.'

'How do you know? Has he said anything to you?' 

'I just know,' she repeated, distantly.

I conceded she probably did, at that. She's such a caring, considerate nature, is Jenny. She cares about everyone. Her radar seems to pick up the strayest signals from anyone in distress around her. 

'Yea, poor guy, he can't seem to catch a break these days. But honestly, his work rate hasn't dropped off or anything like that.'

'But we ought to do everything we can to help him, oughtn't we?'

I considered. We'd already given him compassionate leave for a time, and like I said his work performance, since he came back, was as good as ever, so it seemed hardly necessary to go through that again. Unless, of course, he actually suffered bereavement. I couldn't tell whether that was likely to happen soon, or not. His father was quite seriously ill, as far as I could gather, but in stable condition. Hanging on.

'Just talk to him,' she urged.

I had already done so, several times. I like to think I maintain a sympathetic work environment and we have a good team. Our work is the usual cliched work in a nondescript office but in the three years I've been here, running the team, there have never been any significant problems among us. We all look out for each other. But now, with Jenny talking up Tyler's misfortunes, I suddenly felt a stab of unease. Maybe I really did need to do more to help him.

'I will, Jenny. Thanks for your concern.'

She smiled rather doubtfully as she turned away.

That was just last week. And I'm starting to think more and more that Jenny's fears about Tyler are quite justified. He's looking more worn and haggard as the days go by. I've tried the therapeutic talk, suggested that he take more time off if he wants it, but he barely even said anything in reply. Just looked at me with those deep-set eyes flashing with a fitful fire. God, what really is going on with him?

And he keeps on showing up for work.

Jenny, of course, has deputized herself to look out for him as much as possible. Once again she collars me after a Friday morning meeting, when we're all set to leave for the half-day.  I  occasionally do wish that she didn't care about others quite so much, when she keeps me back for half an hour expatiating upon her suffering fellow human being.

'He *really* needs a break,' she insists.

'But he isn't taking it,' I point out patiently.

She's silent for awhile, her pretty face creased with a frown.

'Ill persuade him,' she says finally. 'I can arrange a break for him. In fact, we can take it together.'

This last bit catches me by surprise, rather. Sounds like an office romance brewing. For some reason, even although Tyler had just broken up with his girlfriend and Jenny's similarly unattached at present, the idea had scarcely occurred to me. I suppose, because they were such good workers, you wouldn't expect them to compromise that fact by getting romantically involved? I didn't like the idea too much, actually. Office romances generally turn out to be somewhat ill-advised, to say the least.

'Look - uh, I know you are due for some leave, too, but -'

She looks at me narrowly. Somehow I can't gainsay her. She always has that trick of making me feel *un*official, goddammit.

Talking of breaks, I've got one planned myself for this weekend, including Monday and Tuesday of next week. That's why I was particularly anxious to get away on the Friday.  I'm looking forward to it. 

The weekend floats lazily by.

 And then, on the Monday, I get the worst shock of my life.

An emergency call.

It's Tyler. I mean, it's *about* Tyler, and what he's just done. 

Showed up for work that morning, as usual. But this time, he was carrying a firearm, and proceeded to use it. Proceeded to shoot up the place. Left two of his colleagues dead, and five injured. Died himself, finally, by his own hand.

I listen to this report, feeling myself sinking in a sea of cold horror. This can't be .... Dear God, it just *can't.*

But, incredibly, that isn't even the worst.

Apparently, Jenny was with him too. *Helping* him. Now she's under arrest. 

They'd planned a break together, alright. A *psychotic* break, by the sounds of it.

I had come to notice the signs with Tyler, but never any with Jenny ....

She'd looked out for her troubled work colleague so thoroughly that I don't have a work team left.
