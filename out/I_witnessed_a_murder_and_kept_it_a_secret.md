This is not the kind of thing I’d like to discuss and I’d like to remain anonymous. I’m 22 years old and suffer from agoraphobia; I have this fear of being outside and around crowds or people in general. I really liked going outside when I was younger but my panic and anxiety grew when I had been disconnected from my family during an event and found. That’s a story for a different day though. I’ve come to confess the burden that I had been holding onto, the thing that has been making this guilt and shame crash down over me. On December 2nd 2024 I witnessed a murder and I kept it a secret.

I’m usually home alone since my boyfriend goes to work to support the both of us. With this free time that I have I usually stare outside my bedroom window and people watch. The area that my window is located on is the side of our apartment building in which I’d have to get very close to in order to look down and through the alleyway that stares back up at me and greets me everyday. It’s a rather busy alleyway. Many young adults, couples, and even kids pass through since it’s not a slim area and it is somewhat lit for others comfort and security. The only thing I’ve heard coming from that alley is a broken bottle that a raccoon happened to knock over one night. 

The night IT happened I was in bed as usual trying to at least get some rest since nobody could be heard passing through the back passageway. Tapping of heels started to echo through the night and up to my window filling the space in between the apartments; I turned over and placed my hands on the ledge of the windowsill peeking over and down to see what had peeked my interest. A woman passing through on her way home, to a bar, a club, home? I wasn’t sure. I shook the thoughts of her whereabouts and continued watching her hoping to overhear a crazy phone call or her boyfriend coming to get her to apologize, anything. The tappings doubled, the second pace was off though, it sounded like someone was running. I tried looking behind the woman but I could only see so much from where I was; An instant black figure rushed toward her, their arms covering her face as a struggle ensued. She was kicking, her heels clicking and clacking at the concrete but no screams could be heard, she was muffled to the point where no one would even peek outside to check on such a thing. 

I didn’t know what to do, I hated that I didn’t. What if I had said something and he came for me? What would have happened if I did try to stop him? Would he still kill her even if I saw? Does he even care to get caught or not? I can't go outside. All the while thinking that I couldn't move, my body froze as the top of my head and eyes stared at the two. I couldn’t do anything. I took in everything that had happened; The lead up, the struggle, and when this random man inevitably waved his hand across the woman's neck and against her stomach. Over and over and over and over. She was lifeless. I’d never seen a body lose its light before and yet I couldn't look away, I couldn't fathom what had happened and yet all I did was stare at this crime. He just left her there. A slit to the throat and some stabs to the stomach that I couldn't even focus on. I watched as he dropped her body in a pool of her own blood leaving her there for someone to find like trash. But I just continued to stare, I felt the food in my stomach start to come up, my hand quickly rushed up to my mouth covering it as I moved away from the window and released everything onto the floor. My body was shaking from the horror that I had witnessed, it couldn't have been real.

“It wasn’t real. What if he saw me? What if he’s coming for me?”

My mind was pacing and pinponging in my head back and forth. I spent the whole night in bed ,my back facing my once safe haven wondering what to do, If I should even call anybody or if I should even get involved. I was awake the whole night and morning. My body was still facing away, even when I heard screams, police sirens, and ambulances all within an hour of that morning. 

I remember the feeling of a tightness on my chest and cold sweat making its way through my body. I couldn’t tell anyone. I can’t tell anyone what I had witnessed. I was worried that even if I told my partner what I had witnessed he’d become disgusted with my actions or even have the cops stop by and talk to me. I don’t want to be involved, I wish I could just erase it from my memory. I wish that everyday now. 

I stood in my room the entire day, even when my boyfriend had come back from work I hid under my blankets. Terrified and shameful of the justice I could serve this murderer with but I didn’t have the courage to even say anything about what had happened. A rhythm of loud bangs rang through the apartment

“Police! Open up!”

I peeked through my blanket and froze upon hearing the front door and their introduction. The banging continued, louder, faster, crawling into my mind as I knew I’d been caught; Knowing that I could have done something to prevent what had happened. I shakily pulled myself up from bed, blanket still around me as I made my way towards the bedroom door. I creaked it open and stopped once I heard the front door start to open. I peered through the crack, my curiosity and adrenaline pumping. It was my boyfriend who had responded to them. 

“Good morning officers. What can I do ya for?”

From where I’d been looking his back was facing me, the officers covered by his frame as he spoke to them. 

“Good morning, sir. We’re just here to ask you a couple of questions about a murder that had taken place. We noticed that a bedroom window from this apartment appears to be looking directly towards the alleyway where our victim had been killed. We just want to ask if you had seen anything or even heard anything. 

“I’m sorry officers but I live here by myself and I work so often that I’m gone throughout the morning and night, I only ever come back here for necessities so I can stay at my girlfriends place.”

My ear had been pressed against the crack of the door to really be sure if I had heard what I heard. ‘What is he talking about.. I live here with him… what girlfriend is he talking about if not me? Is he cheating on me? Should I come out?’

I could feel my mind slipping away with thoughts all at once. I couldn’t focus on what the officers had said. I couldn’t focus at all on anything. 

“Yes of course. I’m sorry I couldn’t be more helpful officers. My thoughts and prayers go out to the victim’s family. I’ll be sure to contact you if I hear anything. Take care.”

Then the door had closed. ‘What is going on?’ I thought the myself. I was frozen for a bit before I swung my bedroom door open and rushed over to him, beating at his chest, my vision blurry with tears. 

“What are you talking about! Why did you lie! You’re with someone else! I could’ve come clean! I could’ve been freed!” 

I was shouting anything that had come to mind. I couldn’t control myself, I couldn’t even understand what I was saying out loud. I looked up at him and he just stared down at me, not a single emotion in his eyes. Until he spoke. 

“I’m not your boyfriend. We’ve been over this.” 

He gripped me by my arm pulling me into my room before tossing me to the floor like a rag doll. My body hitting the hard floor with urgency, a groan leaving my mouth. 

“W..What do you mean. Why are you saying this. Please.”

He didn’t show any emotion towards me, not like he had done before. He looked so cold and uninterested in what was going on between me and him. Between my bedroom window and I. 

“If I knew you’d turn out this crazy I would’ve left you where I found you.” 

“It’s been nine years now. That’s how long you’ve been away from your family. Away from the world. From everyone. When are you going to understand that you don’t even exist anymore.”

He crouched down to my level, I was so confused. Why was my boyfriend telling me all of this. What was he even saying? I saw him reach over towards my nightstand picking up a thick newspaper before placing it down in front of me. I couldn’t believe it. I made the news? How?

“W..Why am I on the paper..?”

I watched as he stood up and walked towards my door 

“We’ve had this conversation multiple times. I’m not your boyfriend. You’ve been missing for nine years now.”

Then he left my room. Shutting it behind him before I heard a clicking locking sound from the outside.
