You know I never believed…in ghosts and aliens  and stuff…they freaked me out when I was younger but as I got older I knew the ugly truth that there was nothing else out there. Humanity…we were it. But…I was wrong. The things I’ve witnessed on our college spring break cruise ship…I will never forget…ever. You’ve probably never heard of the SS Quinton. I wouldn’t assume so seeing the government worked hard to cover their tracks. They…they-they’re all dead. Only a handful survived the incident; my friends died too and I can’t even speak about it courtesy of the government. Well fuck that I have to get this story out or I will go absolutely insane…I don’t even care if it costs me my life. Here’s the untold story of the SS Quinton.

Now it hasn’t been too long since I was rescued and forced to sign this waiver saying I wouldn’t go public with this. Well honestly thinking in that moment I couldn’t understand why they wanted it hidden it’s not like anyone would believe me in the first place. The waiver was weird in its own right. It was like an almost finished printed newspaper except the only thing on there was our story. It said we were stranded in the ocean for days on end and someone ended up going insane and killed the others in a manic state. I was disgusted to sign it but what could I do? Disobey the government? No thanks I don’t want to end up in a morgue due to “Mysterious circumstances”…I did sign it. 

It’s been a couple weeks now and I can’t hold in what I’ve been through. I have to tell someone but at the same time I need this story out there. So my friend, who was sick on the day of the cruise, recommended this website to use. To tell what we have been through. I…i honestly don’t know where to begin. I guess you’ll want me to start with from the beginning. The beginning…well I guess the best starting place would be the boarding day. 

It was a clear blue sky day with a bunch of people interacting with each other. I was just arriving with my parents. “Have a good day sweetie!” She said as I left the car with all my luggage. The cruise brochure said it would only last 9 days tops. 4 days to the island and 4 days back with one spent on the island. We…uh…never made it to the island. I packed a little heavy with things I possibly would need. I’ll explain the contents of my luggage a little later but for now I just look back at my mom and dad and I wave bye to them. As I approached the stairs to board the ship I pass by a man and crew security arguing with each other. I guessed at the time the guy didn’t have his ticket on him so they wouldn’t let him on. I didn’t really pay much attention to that as I gave my ticket and went onboard. 

Inside the ship was massive compared to the outside. It had 3 floors on it each with 10 cabins and 2 bunks beds in each cabin. The cabins themselves were pretty small in length but I didn’t mind. My room isn’t that big either. The only things I really have in my room is a Rick and Morty poster, gravity falls dvd, the thing dvd, and whole bunch of other horror movies along with a tv and a ps4. I don’t really play much of my PlayStation anymore especially after I got into my local state college. I wanted to major in biology but instead I went with chemistry. Anyways I put my luggage in my cabin and look around the place. The walls were a very beautiful shade of wood and there was a window in our cabin looking out into the open sea. 

I wanted to explore(I’ve always liked exploring) and so I did. I left my cabin and looked around the others and I got to say it’s pretty surreal when you actually look down a long hallway. Not glance or whatever but REALLY look down there. I always would think that maybe if I stared down there long enough the hallway would stare back at me too however I never had such a feeling…until now. I could feel something watching me down that hallway and…”Hey Max!” I nearly jumped out my skin when I heard Braxley call my name behind me. “You Asshole! Why did you go doing that?!” “Oh shit dude I’m sorry I didn’t know you were doing your whole staring down a hallway thing. My bad dude.” He turned to walk away and as he did I could’ve sworn at that moment something felt off. Really off. 

As I read my chemistry book in my cabin..alone. I heard the captain over the intercom stating we were sailing off. As I watch the docks disappear over the horizon I felt a pit in my stomach start to form. I felt true dread that day and I chose to ignore it…how ignorant I was.

Later that night was dinner in the cafeteria which was a massive piece of decor and apparently there was also a show which I didn’t notice in the brochure. It was a good show really. I enjoyed the circus level acts performed on stage as we ate food from around the world. Food from Tokyo, Korea, China, Russia, and of course USA. But the one that struck me as odd was one plate that came from a place called the Bermuda. On that said plate was nothing…except for…white dust. I almost didn’t notice if wasn’t for Randy pushing me into the display. “Ooo whatsup peabrain? Got any bright ideas for how we’re gonna save the earth from carbon dioxine.” “Dioxide.” I said in a mocking tone and almost immediately regretted it as Randy punched me in the mouth and then spat on me as his friends pulled him away. As I was standing up I noticed the powder on my hand and I brushed it off not thinking about want it was more thinking about when Randy was coming back. He never did.

It would start soon. I was laying in my bed asleep when I heard a loud gunshot ringing through the air. It shot me up real quick out of bed and I quickly headed to my bag grabbing a knife my dad gave me for protection. Before I knew it my roommate was already out of bed and opening the door to look outside. It didn’t take me long to catch up behind him to look out as well. Luckily I brought my camera for sight seeing and I pointed it down the hall. And what I saw down there was terrifying.

I couldn’t describe it to you if I had the words. I didn’t and still don’t know how the hell those walls got like that. It was almost as if we were on a different ship entirely. Gone were the bright lights, loud music, and most noticeable of all…everybody was gone. Just gone. The hall as we went down it was big and deserted. The walls looked older and molded, the paint was chipped down to bare wood, and they were leaking. Hell we were barely able to see anything if at all if it wasn’t for the moonlight peering through the windows. It illuminated our descent to the first floor as we continued our search for what that gunshot was. And what we found…

Bodies…everywhere…it would’ve been bad and scarring on its own if they were regular dead bodies however they…weren’t. All of them were the same every single one. White dust laid next to them as did a pool of blood. Their eyes were…sunken in and their bodies looked like they had no…bones….inside them. They all looked like pieces of leather…just laying there on the ground. Even after all these weeks I can still see them. Vividly. They looked deflated like a balloon or one of them bouncy castles. Their mouths hung out in horror yet their eyes weren’t visible enough to see if that was in horror or adulation of someone. I looked to my left where Toby was in shock and horror like me. We both were shaking heavily and we were about to leave when a sound of footsteps behind us rang out. I griped my knife tightly reading to swing and I quickly do at the sound of the footsteps behind us. 

I’m sorry to interrupt here but they’re watching me. I can see them outside staring at my house. I can’t write anymore or they’ll know what I’m up to but I’ll be writing again soon. I can’t keep posting everyday the government might be watching so I’ll post when I  can.
