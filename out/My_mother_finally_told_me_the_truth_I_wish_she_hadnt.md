I’m not writing this for sympathy. I’m writing it because someone else out there might be on the edge, quietly screaming like I was, and maybe this will keep them from falling.

I was never abused. Not physically. Not the way that leaves marks people can photograph or talk about in interviews. But silence—prolonged silence—can shape a person like fire shapes glass. Subtle. Permanent. Fragile.

Growing up, my mother never really looked at me. She made food. Paid bills. Occasionally reminded me to shower or not be weird in front of company. But love? Warmth? Concern? Those things stayed buried behind her tired eyes and her louder-than-necessary television.

School wasn’t any better. I was the kid who got his stuff stolen during gym, who learned to laugh along with the jokes about him just to survive. I got good at disappearing. At being a ghost even before I was grown.

By the time I hit twenty-six, I’d had maybe three people in my life call me a friend—and none of them stuck around. I had a job, some bills, and a mother who still spoke to me like I was a stranger renting her spare room.

I started hearing things after my birthday. First in dreams. Then, gradually, while awake. Just… ideas, mostly. Thoughts that didn’t feel like mine. Little whispers from the back of my brain.

“She never wanted you.”

“You don’t belong anywhere.”

Some nights I’d wake up in the hallway. Other times, my reflection would feel slightly delayed—like it was catching up.

I went to a psychiatrist. They called it major depressive disorder with psychotic features. Gave me pills. Told me it might get worse before it got better.

And yeah, it did.

The pills made everything slow. Numb. Like I was underwater watching my own life unfold behind glass.

One night, I sat across from her—my mother—at the kitchen table. I’d been thinking for days about how to ask. How to open a real conversation.

“I think something’s wrong with me,” I said.

She barely looked up. Just sighed.

“You always say that,” she muttered. “Grow up.”

It was the way she said it. Like I was a disappointment for even existing.

A week later, I tried again. This time she looked me right in the eyes and said it.

“I never loved you. Not really. I just didn’t know how to get rid of you.”

That was it. No screaming. No drama. Just the plain, exhausted truth.

Something in me cracked. I remember standing. Walking. I remember her eyes widening—but not in fear. Just confusion. As if she couldn’t comprehend why I was crying.

I don’t remember the rest clearly. Just the stillness afterward. The hum of the refrigerator. The way the knife felt heavy but distant in my hand.

I sat with her for hours after it happened. Watched her body grow cold. Watched my reflection nod back at me in the oven door. No voices. No fear. Just silence.

This morning, I realized what peace really is.

It’s not the absence of noise. It’s not even the absence of pain.

It’s what comes when there’s no one left to scream.[Quiet Doesn't Mean Peace](https://youtu.be/I7Q0xPLY6Ac?si=IwnnPndEtOa-nwsh)
