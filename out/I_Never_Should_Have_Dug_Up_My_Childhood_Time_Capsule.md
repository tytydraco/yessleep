It started last summer when I decided to sell my parents' old house. They'd both passed away a few years back—Mom from cancer, Dad from a heart attack that hit him like a freight train—and the place had been sitting empty ever since. I grew up there, in that creaky Victorian on the edge of town, but after college, I moved to the city and never looked back. Too many bad memories, you know? The kind that creep into your dreams and make you wake up sweating.

Anyway, I was out in the backyard, pulling weeds and trying to make the property look half-decent for the realtor. That's when I remembered the time capsule. My best friend Tommy and I buried it when we were twelve, right under the old oak tree. We were obsessed with those "messages to the future" things back then—stuffed it with comic books, a mixtape, some baseball cards, and a Polaroid of us grinning like idiots. I figured it'd be fun to dig it up, maybe even sell some of the junk on eBay.

The ground was hard, baked from the heat, but I grabbed a shovel from the shed and started hacking away. It took about an hour before the blade hit something solid. Not the metal lunchbox we used, though. This was bigger, heavier. I pried it up, dirt cascading off the sides, and there it was: a rusted ammo can, the kind my dad kept from his army days. Weird, I thought. We definitely didn't bury that.

I popped the latch, expecting maybe some forgotten tools or whatever. But inside... God, I can still smell it. A wave of rot hit me like a punch, thick and sweet, like meat left out too long. There were plastic bags in there, sealed with duct tape, and something dark sloshing around at the bottom. My hands shook as I pulled one out. It was heavy, squishy. I tore the corner open, just a little, and that's when I saw the fingers. Human fingers, severed at the knuckles, nails painted chipped red. There were rings on a couple—cheap gold bands, one with a tiny diamond. The skin was wrinkled, preserved somehow, but starting to decay.

I dropped it, bile rising in my throat, and scrambled back. But curiosity—stupid, morbid curiosity—made me look closer. There were more bags: one with what looked like ears, lobes pierced with earrings still in them; another with strips of skin, tattooed with faded ink. And at the bottom, a jar filled with teeth, yellowed and bloody at the roots. Dozens of them. I vomited right there in the grass, heaving until my stomach ached.

The police came quick after I called. They cordoned off the yard, dug up more—turns out the ammo can was just the start. Under it, wrapped in tarp, was a body. Or parts of one. A woman's torso, carved open like a gutted fish, organs missing, ribs cracked and splayed out. Her face... Jesus, her face was the worst. The skin had been peeled back from the cheeks, exposing raw muscle and bone, eyes gouged out and replaced with marbles. Cheap blue ones, like from a kid's game. The cops said she'd been dead for years, maybe a decade, based on the decomposition.

They questioned me for hours. Did I know anything? Had my parents ever acted strange? I told them no, but that wasn't entirely true. Dad was always distant, disappearing for days on "hunting trips" without ever bringing back game. Mom would cry at night, lock herself in the bathroom. And Tommy... poor Tommy vanished that same summer we buried the capsule. Everyone thought he ran away—troubled kid, bad home life. But now? I wondered.

Days turned into weeks, and the investigation dragged on. They identified the woman as a local hitchhiker who'd gone missing in '98. No leads on the killer, though. The house sale fell through, obviously. I started staying there again, couldn't afford a hotel. That's when the nightmares kicked in. I'd dream of digging, endless digging, and finding more bodies—friends, family, all staring up at me with those marble eyes.

One night, I couldn't sleep. The house creaked like it was alive, wind rattling the windows. I went downstairs for water and heard scratching from the basement. Faint, like nails on wood. I grabbed a flashlight, heart pounding, and descended the stairs. The air was musty, dust motes dancing in the beam. At the far end, behind stacked boxes, was a loose panel in the wall. I pried it open, and there it was: another cache.

This one was fresher. Bags with chunks of flesh, still pink in places, blood congealed but not fully dried. A hand with a wedding ring I recognized—my ex-wife's. We'd divorced five years ago, but she vanished last winter. Cops called it a runaway. And there, in a Ziploc, was a tongue, pierced with a stud. Tommy had one just like that.

I froze, the flashlight slipping from my hand. That's when I felt the breath on my neck. Hot, ragged. I turned, and there he was—Dad. Or what was left of him. His skin hung loose, like it'd been stretched and sewn back wrong, eyes glassy marbles rolling in sockets. He grinned, teeth filed sharp, and whispered, "Welcome home, son. We've been waiting to add you to the collection."

But the twist? It wasn't a dream. I woke up this morning in the hole I'd dug myself, dirt filling my mouth, fingers raw from scratching. The cops are coming again—I called them. But as I type this, I can feel it starting. The urge to dig deeper. To collect. Dad's not dead. He's in me now. And you're next if you come looking.

Wait, no. That's not right. I didn't call the cops. I called you. All of you reading this. Come find me. The house is waiting. Bring your smiles.
