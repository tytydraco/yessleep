So I’ll admit me and my friend Daniel are cocky, cheeky idiots. This started as us arguing with girls, getting into fights etc. But this was never enough. We always went for more and more ventures to get us into more and more trouble. I am going to therapy after our recent events and they say this was a cope for mental illness. Its come to me know I’ve been suffering from depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. So I guess it has some truth behind it.

Me and Daniel were really into horror. So thats what got us into the dark web. After school every night he’d come over and we’d watch livestreams and browse the purchase options. And no this isn’t a “someone hacked our webcam” I mean. I wish that was the case. Our tendencies went too far one day. I still remember it.

*April 5th 2024*

That date gives me flashbacks I despise. I remember it like it was yesterday. 

One day we did our routine. Went on the dark web, joined lives, typed dumb shit. This went on for hours and we were laughing crazy hard. Until, we messed with the wrong criminals. We loaded up a livestream by one of our previous trolls. It was a boy, strapped to a chair. He was being tortured by a group of masked men. We weren’t fazed as this stuff was usual. Until Daniel said something that made me feel an icy finger trace down my back. “IS THAT JOSHUA?”. I glanced back at my monitor and my face paled. It was our friend. He was on the livestream. We fucked up. The men turned to the camera as if they heard us.

One of the men grabbed a pen and scribbled down something on a piece of cardboard. “Is it funny now?”. I read those words and turned to Daniel. We knew one of us was next. Or, we didn’t want to chance it. I unplugged my pc and it shut down. “You gunna stay the night?” I stated still with my eyes opened widely. “No shit.” He replied. He was clearly shook.

My parents were visiting my grandma for Christmas. We were alone. That night neither of us slept. We jumped at any little noise that went on. Until the sun rose. We had no food left. There was a half pack of ramen left. One of us had to go out. “We can’t risk both of us dying.” I stated. “I’ll go.” Said Daniel in a flash. 

As he left the house I pulled all the blinds down and left the front door with the latch on. Minutes turned into hours and Dan never returned. The next morning a soft thumping noise came from my door. “It’s the police. Open up.” I opened the door. “Im here for the investigation of the disappearance of Daniel Kufakwa.” The police officer said. “You were the last one seen with him.”

I told the officer everything that happened. He believed me. There was no doubt. 

“You look starving, wanna go get a donut or two?” I nodded in melancholy. Knowing my friend was off the face of the earth as far as anyone knew. But I had a faint idea.

The officer pulled outside of dunkin donuts and walked us in. He payed for my breakfast and sat me down.

“Dark web stuff?” 

“We find it hard to break that stuff down.”

“I know. I know. I can help I’ve been using computers for years.” I responded. Wanting to help my friend.

We chatted and talked about the story, running through every small detail. 

“We can have an officer posted outside if you’d like, only for one night as a-lot of criminal activity goes on around here.”

I instantly nodded. 

As we arrived back at my house, my blood ran cold. It was the same. But I had a weird feeling of doom. I had no choice but to brush it off.

I climbed onto my pc to get my mind off of things. The night passed. I didn’t sleep again. The officer came inside. “All clear, I’ll be back when theres a lead.” 

The day passed slowly. Something was off. I had to investigate. I opened my onion browser. I saw the account had a new live on. I clicked, my hand shaking. I saw Daniel. In the same chair. Being recorded by an old camcorder.

They burned him. Beat him. Cut him. Until he lost it. He choked himself out with the ropes.

A light flickered. I looked up and my webcam light was on. It flickered to my screen showing me sitting in my chair. I looked and saw masked men in the corridor behind me. They couldn’t be there. They were just torturing my best friend.

A hand covered my mouth and I was tossed into a chair. Ropes foreboded my hands and ankles from moving. I looked up at the men. Something was off. They were blurring. As if they were phasing. Then they focused. They picked up a crowbar and started beating me down. They grabbed a knife and started cutting my arms and legs. 

Thats when the worst came to be. I closed my eyes and when I reopened them. I was sat in my chair holding a knife. Cuts on my wrists. Hitting my arteries.

The next thing I remember was people shouting and I was moving through hallways. When I reopened my eyes I was in a hospital. Connected to a bunch of machines. I gasped for air and a doctor walked in.

“What happened?” I asked while crying.

“You were found in your home bleeding out in a chair. Just free dangling.”

“Did you find Daniel?” I asked.

“Who is that?” The doctor replied.

My eyes widened. 
“You were found bleeding.”

“Did you at least find the men?” I replied in a panic. 

“There was no sign of forced entry or anything on your hard drive. We checked your school for that Daniel guy you were scribbling down in your book.” “But nothing was found. We checked with your parents and they said they never knew a guy.”

I was slowly realising. I was in some sort of episode.

“We have done everything. Theres no record of any break in or attack on you. The only thing we caught on your indoor cameras was you talking to air and sitting down and handshaking thin air.” “We also checked the most recent thing and saw you thrashing yourself around and looking at a blank computer screen.”

“Seems you were throwing yourself into a chair. And attacking yourself.”

*The note*

As I was writing this. I was told it was schizophrenia. Now in my final notes I know it’s actually severe insomnia. 

I’ve found, with insomnia, nothings real.

This is my final entry. Fuck you all. They left me alone for so long I had to have fictional friends. Have fun, i hope my body haunts you forever.
