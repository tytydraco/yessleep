Take it from me: some jobs aren’t worth doing no matter how good the money is, or how much shit you're willing to overlook for the sake of an easy life.

I’ve worked the doors of more dive bars, brothels, and bad businesses than I can count, seen things that would make a better man quit. People fighting to bloody unconsciousness in the street, kids OD’ing while passers-by stepped over or around them. Women drunk and spewing in the gutter, and still being ushered in by club owners hanging over them like mosquitoes on stale water. Dead men frozen to death for want of a home while folks lined up only a few feet away to spend their money on booze in the warm—

I saw all this and kept on working with my head down. Never complained as long as my pay ended up in my wallet, and it’s taken me this long to be sorry for that. I was not a good man, and I knew it.

It was my lack of any moral scruples at that time that landed me a security gig at a military lab. The wage was good and the work was easy, and that was all I cared to know.

My job was to guard a live specimen they had living in a backroom of the building, the only action I saw from day to day being to let scientists or the orderlies responsible for feeding and clean-up in or out.

It was quiet, repetitive labor, the kind I liked.

I liked the other guards on duty, too. The guys that ended up doing most of my shifts with me were around my age, leading me to fall in with them and their way of joking around to keep things interesting on the slow days. 

Had I known what I do now I would have kept my distance from them, stayed alert and discouraged that kind of horseplay. But in the end I was as much to blame for what went down as they were, and maybe even a little more.

Still, sometimes I wonder if what happened to us was inevitable, a secondary experiment set up by the military without our knowledge. Maybe we were chosen for our youth, the conditions we worked in purposefully built with far less protections than we were led to believe.

At this point nothing would shock me less, and intentional or not I’m sure those scientists were grateful for their findings.

The animal in the room we were guarding had come from a forest somewhere; the locals in that anonymous location, generally suspicious of any military presence in the area, had supposedly lead representatives right into the creature’s habitat, suggesting that it had been a nuisance to them that they were glad to be rid of.

Now it was a military asset and effectively their prisoner, though to this day I don’t know if that thing was aware enough to realise it, or—if it did—to care.

Every few days we guards were required to release the complex lock system on the cell door to allow scientists through to conduct their experiments with the creature. Or, more accurately, with the unlucky men and women they brought into that room with them— hostages, I guessed, or long-term jailbirds hoping to reduce their sentences by volunteering to take part in human trials. 

They’d be dragged out of that cell sweaty and staggering, clearly affected by some influence within. I figured the creature was being used as some form of living torture device, though it never moved much except when the orderlies brought in live rats or insects for it to eat, which it did slowly and without any visible interest in its handlers.

For this reason none of us on security were particularly afraid of it, though we knew more or less what it could do. We’d witnessed both janitors and scientists go in with headphones over their ears, which we were also required to wear when opening the doors; from watching through a reinforced glass panel we deduced that the creature made some sound that affected the poor saps brought in to meet it.

You’d see its body trembling as they entered, the rudimentary hole it had as a mouth falling open over its flat teeth. Its back legs would rub together, and not knowing the difference between a grasshopper or any other kind of insect behaviour everybody on security took to calling it Jiminy Cricket, or sometimes just Jim.

“They’re going in with Jim,” we’d say to each other whenever we got a call through to prepare the doors for the scientists and their human subjects to pass. “Poor bastard doesn’t know what he’s in for.”

Neither did we. Our guesswork never even came close.

Through the long, quiet hours in between test days my team and I would end up talking about the thing that we were guarding. Kidding around, really, mainly to shuck off some of the unease that came of extended periods alone with our charge.

While we weren’t scared of it, per se, it wasn’t comfortable to look at.

The cricket had an oily, hard-shelled exterior, its bald head eyeless, but vaguely humanoid. Its limbs might have been, too, only all six were folded backwards like a bug’s and tapered into fingerless ends. The creature was smaller than the average man, or looked to be until the fleshy brown sheets it had as wings opened out, which they sometimes did while it ate, taking up half the wall.

The cricket could have overpowered any of its keepers easily if it wanted to, but I guess it hadn’t the smarts to try, or else it had enough to know it was onto a good thing getting food and board with so little effort on its part.

No one on security knew much about it except what we could see for ourselves. The docs wouldn’t tell us anything and shut us down whenever we tried to ask. As far as we knew the only risk the creature posed to human beings was in the cry it made when anyone approached, and even then the symptoms appeared to be temporary, wearing off as the subjects were led away from the room.

At that point we hadn’t heard the noise ourselves due to the mandatory headphones, as well as the walls and doors of the cell being heavily sound proofed.

We wanted to know what exactly could be so bad about it that grown adults would start retching and crawling around on the floor to get away from it, and there was no way of finding out without experiencing it with our own ears.

It didn’t occur to us that it was better to leave our curiosities well alone. We were all barely more than kids at the time, bored and stupid and worn down by all we’d seen into a dangerous apathy. Besides, the human subjects had always come out of that room alive, and so we had no reason to think the sound would cause any lasting damage. 

One shift we started seriously planning how to go about our personal experiment without being fired.

We had full control over the security cameras, which could be switched on or off from outside the room, as well as the lock system, making it easy for us to enter and exit rapidly and so avoid being caught.

My youngest colleague, Carson, volunteered to go in first. At twenty-two he looked a good five years younger, stood bouncing on his heels and whistling, full of adrenaline.

“Let me in, boys,” he said. “I’m ready.”

We did as we were told, the heavy doors sliding apart as we released the locks, then closing at Carson's back.

Watching him through the glass panel my other colleague Stanmer and I made mocking gestures at him, our headphones secured over our ears. We were all confident he’d be in and out quicker than the regular subjects, who only ended up in the cell for so long because we kept the doors shut fast against their pounding fists and mouthed pleas for freedom.

Carson would be out in seconds, we thought, with a sore head for his troubles, and nothing more. He grinned at us over his shoulder, taking narrow steps towards the cricket until it shifted on the wall.

"Look at that asshole," Stanmer commented fondly; I only knew what he said from reading his lips. "He's gonna regret this. Just watch."

The cricket's mouth opened, and even from a distance and behind thick glass we could see its weird limbs rattling together. Though I couldn't hear it I felt a sort of vibration through my skull, and glancing at Stanmer I knew he felt it, too.

"Here we go," I said. "It's singing."

Carson was listening, stood with his back to us in a kind of trance. This wasn't unusual for initial subject reactions, so Stanmer and I just chuckled a little, nudging each other back and forth. Then Carson started twitching violently like a body caught in a hail of gunfire and dropped to the floor, making no attempt to claw to the exit the way we'd all agreed to when it got too much.

It occurred to me as I watched him convulse that he wasn't fully conscious, that none of the subjects had been until they'd been pulled up onto their feet and beyond the doors, beyond the cricket’s song. It was when I saw the dark stain spreading through Carson’s pants and across the steel tiled floor that I knew for sure he was out of it.

"Shit," I said, and facing, Stanmer I added, “Go in and get him. I'll stay out here and get the doors."

I reopened the cell and stepped aside before Stanmer had the chance to complain about it. He mouthed something at me, then, realising I couldn't understand him, just shrugged and went on in.

Unaffected by the cricket, Stanmer walked directly to Carson and grabbed him under both arms in order to drag his dead weight towards the exit. The moment he put his hands on him Carson's slack body started seizing and kicking all over again, his jaw dropping open in what I could only assume was a scream.

Stanmer did his best to keep on pulling him over to the door, and almost succeeded until one of Carson’s flailing arms hit him in the ear, knocking his headphones off onto the floor. 

Immediately he went rigid, his face twisting towards the creature with an expression of horror unlike anything I'd seen outside of a movie. Rather than drop like Carson, Stanmer’s response was to continue hauling our friend towards the door with one hand, the other scrambling to pick up the headphones and drag them back down over his ears again. 

I couldn't tell whether the two of them were in physical pain, nauseated, or had gone crazy with fear; I figured it was all three at once, and understood that if I left them in that cell any longer I could end up with two stiffs on my hands I’d have to explain away to our higher-ups.

Again I activated the lock release, moving back as the two men collapsed through the entryway, breathing too hard to speak.

When I bent down to help Carson onto his feet he grasped at my face, wrenching one ear of the headphones off me and pointing with his other hand at the creature on the wall.

"Listen," he said— or I think he did; I could barely hear him over its noise. "You better fucking listen, too."

Later he'd tell me that hurt and spite had driven him to do what he’d done, that he couldn't bear the idea of any one of us getting away unscathed. He said he couldn’t remember exactly what he'd experienced in the noise—wouldn't until much later, when everything went to shit—but that he was sorry, anyway.

I think he meant it, then. I really think he did. Still, I resented him for forcing me to listen even when I understood why.

In the few seconds the headphones left my ears I heard the cricket’s song, more like the guttural hum of many men together than any kind of insect. Under it was a dull whining that seemed to stab through my ear and out through my eye with an agony so deep I would have beaten my brains out of my skull on the floor to be rid of it.

Still the worst of that sound was not what I heard but the things it put into my head. Thoughts that—like my colleagues—I'd forget even as we lay sweating and cursing against the locked door of that cell.

I remember the terror of that imagery, the horror and disgust with myself for being able to conceive of such things. And I remember that I'd enjoyed some of what I’d glimpsed, had wanted it to go on and on and to end with the same crazed strength.

How I got out of there and locked up I still don't know, only that I was the one to do it. Later it was Stanmer that, with headphones safely secured, cleaned up the inside of the cell and helped Carson get himself together. The kid was almost mute, shaking and chucking his guts up in the nearest bathroom for almost two hours.

Once our shift was over the three of us stood smoking together by our cars, our hands trembling like we were drunk.

"What did you see, Mac?" asked Carson.

I looked hard at him but saw nothing but an innocent questioning in his eyes.

"Hell if I know,” I said. “But if I'd hung around in there like you I would have been in a wooden box by tomorrow, I can tell you that much. You want to know what I think? The military’s gonna kill with that cricket, and they're gonna take out however many civilians are in hearing range of their targets. They won’t give a damn.”

Carson looked like he might pass out again.

"Come on, guys, we knew who we were working for," said Stanmer. "Don't act like you didn't see something like this coming."

But he said it gently, with sympathy. He'd experienced the sound too, after all, and had hated it as much as we had.

"We should quit," said Carson. "I ain't sticking around. This is too fucked up. I'm out."

I would have gladly gone with him, but I couldn’t admit it.

"If we drop out this early into the game the bosses’ll know something's up," I said. "And if they know we're bailing with classified information on our hands we're all in deep shit. We need to lie low for a while. Play it cool."

It seemed unfair to point out that Stanmer and I wouldn't have heard anything at all if Carson hadn't freaked the way he did, though both of us were thinking it. We knew he’d taken the cricket’s song the hardest, and we couldn’t kick him while he was down.

"Christ," said Carson queasily. "I don't know if I can do this."

"Tough shit," said Stanmer, and flicked his cigarette away into the snow. "We were dumb enough to open that door. We gotta be smart enough to see this shit out to the end."

So we kept working at the lab for another couple of weeks without event, though Carson was jumpy and looked green around the gills every time we opened to door for the cleaners or the next sorry subject to be sent in. He couldn't even bring himself to look through the glass panel anymore.

Stanmer became fascinated with it. He’d always have his face to that window, his breath steaming it white.

"I heard the locals used to put tree gum in their ears so the cricket couldn't get to them," Stanmer said once. "The noise is to keep competition out of its territory, or some shit. Must be more of them out there, somewhere."

I looked at the cheap paint job on the wall and tried to ignore him, hoping that if I did he'd drop the subject. By then I'd decided the less I knew about that creature the better, wishing I’d minded my business like I had all those other times before.

It was 5am on a Monday that I got an unexpected phone call just before my alarm went off for a rare morning shift.

Cursing, I answered my cell.

"Stanmer," I said. "You've gotta be fucking with me. What is it?"

"Look at social media, man," he said. "You still got accounts, right? Any of them. Open them up. Check the news articles. Now."

His voice was dull and dark. I'd never heard him talk that way before and it sent something through me deeper than cold.

I pulled up one of my barely used profiles online and started to scroll. Immediately the same headline was being shared by every page and person I followed. I clicked a link to one of the articles and sat reading it in the early morning darkness.

There had been a mass shooting at an office block in the next town over, every man and woman leaving after work gunned down before they had the chance to comprehend what was happening. Even the security had been taken out; the shooter had access to all the doors and an in-depth understanding of the building's layout and weak points. 

The young man had entered, slaughtering the occupants in relative silence until police had arrived at the scene, hoping to apprehend him.

At this point the shooter—covered in blood, and visibly distressed for the first time since the incident began—started shouting at the officers from an open window.

"I saw it!" he said. "I heard it, and then I saw it! I wanted it! I didn't want to, but I did! I wanted to do it!"

Then he'd turned the gun on himself and had blown a bullet through one ear and out of his left eye, dying instantly.

I couldn't stop replaying the clips that had been taken from the scene, pausing on that bulge-eyed, tormented face. A face I knew, had seen daily at my side for months on end, smiling and laughing. 

I didn't dare bring the shooting up at the lab, where Stanmer and I regarded Carson's replacement in distrustful silence. Only after our shift had ended did we even mention his name, crammed knee to knee in a tiny bar at the fringes of town.

"He must have been fired from security at that office years ago," I said, trying to pretend that I hadn't been dissecting and analysing Carson's dying words obsessively all morning. "Must have had a grudge, decided to go back and see it through.”

"Nah," said Stanmer, shaking his head. "Maybe that's the way they'll spin it, but he never worked there a day in his life. Never even knew shit about it until he went in with Jim that day. See, Carson turned up at my place last night just before it all went down. Asked if I remembered anything else about that cricket. I said no, and how I planned on keeping it that way.

So that’s when Carson told me it was all coming back to him. When the cricket sung to him he started seeing flashes of what he was going to do at that office building. Knew how to get there, how to get around, even how he’d feel doing it. The murder. How he'd kill himself when it was over.

Hell, he said he even liked the idea, even though he swore he never thought that way before. He said he was scared he was going to drive out there and do it that same night.

'Like shit you are,' I said. 'What would you go and shoot a bunch of people for just because some bug in a cage told you to?'

The way he looked at me, Jesus, I'm getting chills just thinking about it. He had those crazy eyes, you know? That smile. 'I wanna do it,' he said. 'I know how good it's gonna be. Just as sweet as that song.' Then I swear he started humming, and it was like that cricket sounded, all those voices. But it was just him standing there."

Stanmer took a drink, looking at his glass like he wished he'd never get to the end of it.

"Why the fuck didn't you tell me sooner?" I asked him. "We could have done something. Stopped him."

"I took Carson’s gun," said Stanmer. "Made him promise to go and see a doctor in the morning. He calmed down. Seemed like I got through to him, you know? But I guess he had another gun somewhere and just went out of town instead and did just what he said he would."

I pushed my own glass away, sickened by it.

"Jesus,” I said. “So, what, you think the cricket made him go crazy? That he wouldn’t have done it if he hadn't gone in there with it?"

Stanmer made a face.

"I ain't saying that. I think it brought it out of him. Found something in his head, just a dark thought like we all have, sometimes. Potential, you know? And instead of being just a thought suddenly it was something he wanted."

I swallowed back a thick ball of saliva and stood up.

"Well, you better tell me if you start remembering that shit in the lab, alright? If you start wanting to shoot anybody— Hell, I'll tie you down if I have to. Just talk, you hear me?"

Stanmer laughed uncomfortably. He wasn't the ‘opening up to people’ type, more the quiet kind that stepped in when others needed something from him.

"Sure," said Stanmer. "Same to you, Mac."

"I mean it."

Stanmer held his hands up in defeat.

"Alright, fuck, I swear it. I don't remember a damn thing I saw when Jim was singing, but if I do, you'll be the first to know."

I wasn't. 

A week later it was Stanmer’s face I saw in the news in an old photograph of him and his wife Amelia, laughing together on a trip they’d taken the previous year.

One night Stanmer had taken a knife to bed with him and stuck it in and out of Amelia so many times that when the cops turned up they couldn't tell if the thing on the mattress with him was even human until they saw the bones. After killing his wife Stanmer had driven that same blade through his own ear with such force and at such a severe angle that it had emerged through his left eye— shouldn't have been possible, the professionals stated, but he'd done it all the same.

News reports claimed that there had been text messages recovered between Stanmer and his wife where he'd discussed having violent thoughts, and that he was handing in his notice at work and moving out of the family home until they passed. Amelia had begged him to stay, saying they'd see a doctor together, and so he'd come home and promptly murdered her.

The same old story, people said, a jealous husband turning like that. It was never out of the blue; they’d find some hint in his past, if they went looking, and then it’d all make sense. But though maybe there was a streak of that kind of violence in Stanmer I knew what had brought it out of him, imagined him humming under his breath as he’d driven up to the house that night. A hum like many voices in one.

Something's going to come out in me too, soon, if I don't make a move. I'm going back to that lab again tomorrow for one reason, and that's to put a pair of those headphones on and shoot that cricket through whatever soft spot in its shell I can find.

Maybe that’ll stop what's happening to me, maybe it won't. If it does the military will probably find a way to get rid of me, anyway, something quiet and convenient you’ll never hear about, but I've made my peace with that.

I've started thinking about my mother, you see, and how I've always hated her.

I know how I’d kill her, if I did it, and I know that it would feel good to me.
