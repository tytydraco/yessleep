Outside the air is warm. Cheerful. A perfect juxtaposition to the inside, where the sea of lifeless bodies shrouded in black are shuffling their way into their seats, stopping only to greet one another with a half smile and an awkward salutation. Soft whispers tiptoe their way between the walls of the tiny white room. The air is stagnant, besides the sweetness of the flowers. Too many flowers. The rows of polished wooden chairs face forward, alluding to a single point in the front. No one dares look at it directly. Eyes drift across the floor, the walls, anywhere else, as though gazing upon the glistening table standing at the front might break down the thin veil of composure holding the air together. 

The soft music fades as a man in the front of the room beacons all to be still in their seats.

“We are gathered here today in the wake of a heartbreaking and unexpected loss. It reminds us how fragile and precious life is. We don’t always understand why such painful things happen, especially when someone so young is taken from us. But we come together today to support one another, to remember her joy, and to hold onto hope…” 

Hope. That’s the word they cling to, but all I see are unfamiliar faces performing grief for a ghost they barely recognize. Strangers dressed up as family mourning a girl they never knew. They’ll dry their borrowed tears before the decay. In a few minutes, I’ll stand before them, play my part and speak my lines. Pretend I lost something. Pretend I’m broken. Pretend I didn't lead a precious gift to the stars myself. 

The flipping of pages brought my attention back to the front. The pastor raised his hand, signaling us to join him in a prayer. ”Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, believe also in me…” 

Almost time.

“In my father’s house there are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?” 

The quiet sobs from my mom intensify. I need to prepare myself. 

“And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also.”

When the prayer ends, the silence lingers, broken only by the quick sniffles of the onlookers. The moment drags on for ages, then he gestures to the front row. 

“At this time, we’d like to invite Lia’s sister, Jenny, to say a few words.” 

That’s my cue. 

I stood up slowly, my movements sunken and calculated. The rows of faces tilted towards me as my shadow stretched along the floor boards, head bowed as if in prayer. If they wanted the grieving sister then that’s what I would give them.

I forced my feet forward, inching my way up to the front as if on trial. Every eye following me, waiting in anticipation for the breakdown. For the inevitable spectacle this is destined to turn out to be. I gripped the podium, forcing my lips into a tight trembling curve. 

“My sister-” I choked out with a rehearsed crack.

One deep breath.

“My sister was…beautiful,” I whispered. “All around beautiful. She had the kindest eyes, a welcoming smile. She never met a stranger, that girl.” 

I let out a small chuckle, wiping the tears wrapped in falsehood from the corners of my eyes. “Oftentimes at home, you’d walk into the kitchen to see Lia dancing around , humming and singing tunes while doing the most random tasks. That was her gift- she could turn any of these horrid mundane moments into ones of such purpose and beauty.” 

I tensed up, pausing, looking around to see if the performance was charming the sea of gawking onlookers. 

“She was… she was the best of us. She was the type of person who never hurt anyone.”

*Lies.* 

“She lit up every room she walked into.”

*And I was the shadow trailing behind, unseen, unchosen.*

“She was smart and driven and talented beyond measure…”

*And I hated her for it.* 

For a brief second, I felt my throat tighten, not from an enveloping sorrow but from rage clawing its way up. I swallowed it down, bent it into something that resembled emptiness and let the silence hang heavy. 

“She was a perfect person, a perfect older sister. I feel like a piece of me is gone. I see her everywhere. She will be missed more than words can ever express.”

*Lies.* 

*Lies.* 

*Lies.* 

“I'm sorry- I can’t” 

I sobbed, my mom and dad stretching their arms out towards me as everyone gave their gentle reassurances. 

My older sister will be missed. 

Just not by me. 

Lia was never cruel. Never intentionally, at least. I don’t think her constant ability to undermine all my work was conscious. She just was. Radiant, effortlessly beautiful, charming, sweet and kind.  People would just orbit her.

Her hair never seemed to tangle. It caught the light and moved subtly, like it had a body of its own, brushing its soft golden glow against the hollow of her back as she laughed or sang. Her skin held warmth even in the winter , that soft, unearthly glow that made everything around her look lackluster in comparison. Every picture of her was perfect. Always front and center, leaving everyone else a dull mirage in the afterglow of her image.

She never just walked anywhere. She glided, her movements slow, fluid, graceful, as though she was hearing music no one else could. Her life was a fairytale, a perfect movie about a perfect girl who always got what she wanted, and our small home was her main stage.

In the kitchen, she’d cook and dance between the counter and stove, humming quietly to herself, twisting her bare feet on the cold tile as though the world existed solely for her to twirl through it. Even the sun seemed to obey her, stretching its warmth to her fingertips and tracing her delicate silhouette across the walls.

I used to think the light simply loved her more.

She was born from all things holy and divine and bright. Cradled in warmth and admiration. Loved by all.

Almost.  
Almost.

While everyone saw her as some celestial thing, light and laughter and effortless grace combined, I saw what they didn't. The way she could smile through all her shortcomings and somehow project them unto me. The way her name always came up first, even when it was *my* work. *My* effort. *My* life and goals and achievements. “You’re so lucky to have a sister like that”, they’d tell me. As if me being in proximity to “perfection” somehow made me less of a failure. 

Every compliment she received was another molten nail taking deep root in my stomach. Every laugh, another reminder that I was invisible behind her, her light being so bright I was trapped in the darkness past its reach . I told myself it wasn’t her fault. I told myself she couldn’t help but be loved. But even saints cast shadows, and mine stretched long behind her, growing darker and darker every time she stepped face first into the sun. 

It started with him. 

Of course it did, right? Doesn’t it always? 

He was mine, at least I thought he was. He surely was at first. He said he loved how I saw the world, and said it was different through my eyes. That I could “Make the world around him feel *real.*” He would make soft promises, showing me a bright future and cradling my damaged ego with gentle force. I believed him. I believed every quiet word he’d whisper in the dark, every promise he’d spit out with that poisoned tongue.  I was happy. *We* were happy, and I was enough. Finally, I was enough. Until I wasn’t. 

His eyes started to wander. 

Not far. 

Just to her. 

He watched her the way people would watch the sunrise, helplessly in awe. Hungrily, as if she were something too precious and beautiful to stare at too long. The worst part of it all, she noticed.

 It was quiet, not outside of the norm for the harshly lit summer afternoons. Lia was in the kitchen doing her usual performance, dancing, baking, and whatever else her precious heart decided to create, when there was a knock at the door. 

I started to descend the steps when I heard her voice creeping its way through the narrow stairwell.

“Oh hey Derek, what a nice surprise. I’ll go grab Jenny!” 

I was already half way down the steps, when I saw him grab her arm, turning her back to face him.

I stopped, watching silently.

“Derek what are-” she gasped.

“Lia. I’m sorry.” He whispered. 

A shadow befell his face, but the warmth in his eyes was undeniable. A warmth and light never once blessed upon him by me. 

“I… I can’t do it anymore. It’s you, Lia. You’re the-”

She grabbed her arm back with a force I've never seen from her. 

“You stop that. I don’t want to hear another word,”

“Lia stop. Please, just listen to me. Lia, I want you!” 

She covered her ears.

“Sorry. I can’t hear you-” 

He grabbed her arms again, forcing them down from the sides of her face. 

In any other situation, I might have laughed watching this childish interaction unfold. But here, seeing this play out, was almost too much to bear. 

She smiled that soft, apologetic smile, that smile that always made her look like she pitied you for feeling anything at all. 

My perfect sister looked at him with her large emerald eyes and told him, “You’re confused. You love Jenny, not me. If you think I’d ever do anything to hurt her, you’re an even bigger idiot than you’re making yourself out to be now. She loves you, and you’re going to come inside and you’re going to be a man deserving of her. And if you hurt her…” 

She kept going. 

*The perfect Lia.*

She started her way up the stairs, jumping when she saw me. 

“Oh! Jenny! I was, uh, I was just about to come get you!” She blustered, cheeks burning.

She never was good at keeping secrets. 

“Oh? Who’s here?”

“Oh! It’s Derek! He just came by to uh…” She trailed off, glancing nervously around the walls as if begging them for inspiration. 

“You’re so stupid.” I chuckled, rolling my eyes and pushing past her to greet Derek, who was standing by the door running his thumb up and down his harshly crossed arm. 

I pretended to not notice the red spots on her arms, and continued to pretend not to notice the bruises on her arms that mirrored the ones left on my already shattered ego. 

Just like how I pretended not to notice that he’d ask where she was before asking how I was doing. 

Just like how I pretended not to notice how he’d linger when she spoke. 

Just like how I pretended not to notice his laughter was suddenly brighter, louder, almost rehearsed when they’d speak. 

Just like how I pretended he still loved me.

She did the right thing, because she *always* did the right thing. 

And I hated her for it. 

I hated that even when she didn’t want what I have she could still pry it out of my grasp. That her angel-like goodness only made her more untouchable, more radiant. She didn’t steal him from me, she didn’t have to. The universe just gave her everything. This child born from the sun getting every gift of light the galaxy could bestow her. 

Even my breaking heart belonged to her. 

But that’s what she did best, wasn’t it? Being an innocent, absent minded thief, stealing all things good in this world and hoarding them for herself. Apologizing for having this magnetic aura of benevolence and godly manner. With this gift came poison, and that poison made me small. *She* made me small.

She made *everything* small. 

And I know. *I know* she didn’t mean to. Everyone keeps saying that. *She didn’t mean to .* But isn’t that worse? Isn’t it worse that she could destroy me without even trying? That she could walk through the world of darkness bathed in sunlight, burning the flesh of my bones in her wake, choking me with the ashes of everything she left behind? 

I stopped eating. 

I stopped sleeping. 

I started listening. 

There’s a sound that comes when you're truly alone. A sound that appears when the air is so quiet that even your heartbeat starts  to sound like someone else’s. That’s when I heard her. 

The promises of the light being returned to me. 

The hushed whisper of salvation. 

The idea of freedom from this unspoken banishment clung to my spine and spread its way into every fiber of my being. 



The kitchen always smelled of lemon and warm bread, frosting the air like a soft promise Lia kept for the house. That night, an aroma of cinnamon and the soft spices she favored clung to the atoms around as if to announce a celebration. She was humming, because of course she was humming, and the light from the single candle on the windowsill pooled over her shoulders, illuminating a halo over her golden hair. 

I had planned my words. I had rehearsed the right timber of accusation, the rawness of my soul that would finally make her understand. But, when I saw her there, barefoot, swaying between the sink and the counter as if this dingy kitchen was a personal ballroom and she was the only invited guest , my rehearsed words curdled and molded into something sharper. Something more small and precise. 

She turned when I spoke, the way she always did. Glancing at me with those bright eyes and a smile, forcing the illusion I was a welcome guest in her masquerade. Making me feel like I was the sole person in the world with her. 

“Jenny?” she asked, a glimmer of worry dancing across her sun kissed cheeks. “What’s wrong?”

She reached for a towel, laughing softly at some private, bright joke that I would never be let in on. 

The towel on the counter lay folded, an invitation for the taking. I moved before I thought. It wasn’t a conscious decision, more like a force of movement being injected through my veins. The motion was small, a careless flick, like throwing a hot dog down a hallway. 

The candle wavered. A breath of air. A wave of motion. The world tilting at a tiny, wrong angle. 

There it was. 

A small, fat flare where the fabric’s lips gently kissed the flame. 

The light finally back in my hands. 

For a second, nothing happened, as if the house itself was holding its breath, asking for permission to let time continue. Lia looked at the towel, then at the flame, puzzled.

“Jenny what’s going…”

Her beautiful face collapsed into a frighted understanding. 

She reached to smother it, because that’s what she always did- fix the small catastrophes the rest of us delinquents caused. She moved towards it, instinctive, the way she has always moved into the spotlight.

For a brief moment, I wanted to stop her. I wanted to scream at her to back away, to leave it. To let me take whatever it was that made her a center of all of the sun’s love. Instead, my lungs filled with something cold and vicious, and I stood silent and rooted as the light caught the edge of the fabric and took it into itself. 

The towel absorbed the flame, burning slowly and then blackening rapidly. Smoke climbed soft and white, then yellow and thick and gray, filling the room with the sound of a hundred tiny screams begging for release. Lia coughed, a sharp noise, and her hand flew to her perfect face, now shrouded in a horrified understanding. She was always the first to try to fix everyone else’s messes, throwing her creative hands over the towel and foolheartedly pressing it into the sink, shrieking  as pus filled blisters started forming. I could have grabbed her then. I could have smashed the flame out, ripped the towel free, thrown a glass of water. A hundred tiny saving graces flashed through my mind, and the hundred tiny things stood between her and the predestined events unfolding.

Something else was there, the shadow of all the times she’d smiled gently while I withered away. The thousand tiny little cuts carved into my chest and engraved on my bones. The one motion felt like muscle memory. A push meant to distance us. Meant to make her stop and gaze upon me. Meant to make her fall back into my hands of her own accord.

She stumbled. Her elbow caught the counter. The towel’s flames ignited the wood. The stove, a trivial tradition Lia upheld every day, became the sacrificial altar of heat. A small flame licked the walls, unaware of the consequence, and then, almost as if seducing the molecular structure of the universe, the room became engulfed. The smoke. The rattle of a pan. The frantic clatter of utensils knocked over in the pitiful rush.

Lia was moving to the sink, smoke rushing into her bloodshot eyes. I reached for her, playing my part. I grabbed and tugged and screamed her name like a prayer. Hands pulled at her singed hair, at her bubbled and decaying wrists. The neighbors pounded on the door. My voice sounded like someone else’s, hoarse and burning hot. When she slipped beneath the smoke, when her knees buckled and her fingers found nothing to grip, I dragged her as far as I could. Flesh slopping off her arms in the pitiful struggle. My arms were crowded with soot, the smell of burnt sugar, and pure, unadulterated bliss.

By the time the lights smeared blue across the windows, there was no neat line between what I had meant and what I had done. I called for help and I cried. I cried tears of relief and she continued to lay still, taken down by the light that loved her so. Wrapped in its heat and its warmth, she was gone. I was the victor. 

They called it a tragic accident. I learned to call it that too when asked. But in the dark, when the house was empty of everything but memory, the smoke still moved through my lungs. The air would still carry the random tune she would hum.  

And Lia would still be dancing. 

My older sister will be missed.  
Just not by me.



Now, standing in the front of the room, I can feel every eye still tracing my every move with silent judgement and pity. They think I’m fragile, just some porcelain doll cracked by golden tragedy and misfortune. I keep my head bowed, bobbing with my practiced muffled sobs. The perfect picture of grief, but inside, I can feel it. The quiet thrill of being observed, of being noticed, of being seen. Of finally being the center of their orbit. Their pity. Their admiration.

When I return to my seat, I see my reflection in the window. For just a moment, the sun shifts, and something behind me moves slow and deliberate. My shadow stretches its way across the floor, long and gracefully dancing against the sunlight, joining me in a blissful victory. I blink, and it stops in its crooked path. The light falls perfectly across my face, warm and golden and divine. Just the way it did for her.  
I smile to myself.

Maybe the light loves me now.



The man upfront said his final words as the forlorn crowd creeped their way out of the tiny room. They said their goodbyes, being entirely too polite, as if they’re afraid of setting off a ticking time bomb. Mom, dad and I lingered, as is expected of the family. Of the *real* family, at least. They sat, hand in hand, sunken and withered, refusing to break eye contact with the casket up front. The air was thick with grief, wilting the flowers and encouraging gravity to press upon the shoulders of the onlookers. Slowly, oh so slowly, they stood, their shadow trailing behind them in a fluid synchronized routine. I stood close behind as they rested their hands atop the coffin, whispering their final words to their chosen daughter. 

I couldn’t help but watch them. 

My mother, now smaller in frame, trembling and holding her sides. My dad, normally the strong stoic type, is a shell of himself. His eyes hollow, bare, his flesh pale and too loose for his frame. I can’t help but to marvel at them. Marvel at their grief.

“Mom, dad…” I whisper, embracing them both. 

They pull me in tight, focusing on me rather than the lifeless doll that was once Lia. 

After what seems like an eternity, we leave. 

My shadow lingering at the grave as we walk away, standing still and watching.

The light returned to its rightful owner.
