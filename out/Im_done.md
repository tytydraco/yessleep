It's night and I still don't know what to do, bodies around me and blood everywhere, my sisters crying asking for mercy from me and I'm still amazed, let's go back to understand what happened

The life I live, it can be said that hell is more merciful than it, everyone and everything was trying to push me towards suicide, it started from my childhood where I kept being bullied from all sides, from my colleagues, from the villagers, even from my family, this torment kept following me all the time And since then I have been patient

"My brother, don't be sad, I am here for you", this phrase I always heard from the people closest to me, my brother who was always beside me, and as for the rest of my family it is as follows
My mother is sick and she is always in bed, but my other brother always hates me and my other sisters, not my father's name, he is the main reason for this torment of me, my brother was the only one who was always by my side but he did not stay as I wished

He and I quarreled over a trivial matter and this made him angry with me and get out of the house. I still don't remember why we quarreled, but I wish it hadn't happened.

It's 10 at night and my brother hasn't come back for 3 days, I asked the others to look for him, but they didn't care about him, and when it was long until I heard the doorbell, I went to him quickly and when I opened the door I found a bag that smelled clogging the nose and when I looked closely at him I found an arm hanging from the bag, I was terrified of the scene and fell to the ground until a human head fell out of the bag and was heading towards me.

The matter did not end with this event, but this family took advantage of the opportunity of his absence, and it burdened me with work and increased my suffering.

I thought it wouldn't get worse than this, but life has another opinion. I had a close friend, who shared her concerns with me and exchanged her for the same.

After thinking about it, every person I considered dear to me has not left me, so I will not make anyone special to me because I am tired of this

Generally, as happened with my brother, it will happen with this friend of mine, but the only difference is that I watched the matter in front of my eyes. We were sitting in our designated place, and her face indicated that she had reached the extremes of depression. I had never seen her in this condition before. I kept trying to calm her down, but she was crying and Don't listen to me, so I lost my patience and told her that I was tired of her and went away, and I wish I had not done this, as soon as I left she called me and said "this because of you" and slaughtered herself in front of me, those were her last words to me
I could not accept what happened and kept blaming myself and saying that I was the reason for her death, without forgetting my vile family that keeps torturing me
Years passed and the situation is still the same, and it is getting worse day by day. One day, my father sent me to buy some cigarettes. As soon as I returned from the shop on the way, some young men arrested me and put me in the alley, and all they did was beat me, and he heard someone say "It's not David."
After a while I woke up and kept checking myself and found my face distorted, I didn't really understand what I had done to deserve this even while I was walking on the road people looked at me that were never looks of regret and pity, but were looks of hatred and malice, they were happy for what happened to me

As soon as I got home I was hoping that no one would see me but what a bad luck the last person I wanted to see saw me, as soon as I closed the door my brother came to me and when he saw my face he started laughing, I mean is someone's face a distorted and pierced funny?
He asked me, "What happened to you?"
I replied, "Some people attacked me."
He didn't show any interest, so I said, "It's strange that someone mentioned your name, yes, he said it wasn't David."
His face looked like he remembered something and said to me, "Oh if it was those people" 
I looked at him in astonishment, "What people?"
He replied, "Just fools i tricked them and stole money from them, it seems they thought you were me, so they beat you."
I am here in astonishment, trying to understand the topic. I asked him, "But what is my fault in this matter?"
He started laughing and saying, "Maybe because you are weak, that's why you couldn't defend yourself, and you deserve this because you fall short in your work, and also what prompted you to pass that way, if you took another path, they wouldn't hit you."

I am currently shocked, I don't know what to say or what to do, then he continued his speech saying "Go and wash your face and then prepare dinner for us."
And I'm going to the bathroom thinking about what's going on and what happened and before I get to the bathroom he comes and says "Oh and also my dad is waiting for you to punish you because you didn't ban him cigarettes" he said looking at me with a wide smile

As soon as I entered the bathroom and saw myself in the mirror, I was shocked by the face I saw, I couldn't find my left eye in its place, my right cheek barely left anything, seeing this face made me repeat the same question "What did I do?" All I wanted was to rest and finish This torment, I found scissors in front of me and I did not hesitate to carry it and stabbed my throat, when I opened my eyes I saw the light, I said to myself it's over, but what a pity it was only the light of the lamp and I'm still alive, not only that, but no I feel that I really stabbed myself, I looked at the mirror and found the scissors in my throat without feeling any pain, and without will, I kept stabbing myself from all sides, but I did not feel anything, suddenly all the wounds and holes began to heal, my face seemed to return to normal, even the wounds From 5 years it has disappeared

When I saw the mirror, I saw a person with black hair and a big mouth full of teeth, that creature kept staring at me and imitating my movements until it came out of the mirror and kept crawling at me, then David entered and was carrying the knife with him, I think he wanted to kill me with it, I was lying on The ground, it was a wonderful opportunity for him to kill me, he reached out and when he was about to stab me I grabbed his hand, he was terrified and nervous I looked at him and saw a monster in front of him with wide teeth and red eyes, I had taken the form of that creature I think, I grabbed him by the neck and raised him high He was crying from the intensity of fear until I bit his head, threw him away and went to the rest, my brothers were in their room and my father was in the living room waiting for his son to come, so I entered him, he was also terrified of my appearance, he tried to catch you, but I cut his neck, I targeted the necks a lot. Any way, I pulled his body and took it to my sisters' room. When they saw the body of the father, they started crying and begging me to say, "Please  forgive us, forgive us."

This is strange, this means that they knew their mistake and continued in it, that made me forget something called mercy, years of torment and in the end you want me to forgive? I did not hesitate to kill them and eat them, every one saw her sister being eaten in front of her, the whole house became full of the smell of blood, fortunately my mother was in a corner or the smell reached her, I changed my clothes and went away because I was afraid that she would suffocate from the smell, she was in a deplorable state I went from her and we started talking, as soon as I finished talking to her, I said goodbye to her and went away from the house that became a bloody massacre
Immediately after that I went to those who beat me, they were in a place raping a girl in turns, I never hesitated, I started cutting them one by one, the girl ran away
As for the last of them, I kept him alive without an arm in order to testify against me and to be tormented psychologically and physically
I really enjoyed killing these guys. People, hearing their screams made me feel comfortable, I'm done
