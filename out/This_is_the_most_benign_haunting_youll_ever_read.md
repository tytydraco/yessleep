A small warning, there's nothing intense about this story. This is merely something that despite its subtly, scares me shitless. And unfortunately I can't even prove if it is strictly paranormal. All I can do is say my honest truth.

Let me preface this with a little bit about myself. I am a well-built southern male with a case of resting bitch face. Of course I'm overweight but between my Southern charm and my general looks. I don't have much trouble from neither animals nor people. The very general "you leave me alone, I'll leave you alone" kind of thing. Well people in real life often call me hulk or Hercules, my online friends just call me fat Thor or Walmart Jesus. Also yes I was taught in public education if my grammar wasn't making it blatantly obvious.

Ever since I was a little kid and I watched Jeepers creepers, I've always been scared shitless of the dark. Or rather poignantly, what lurks in the dark. And that's why working late shift at my job has got me acting quite foolish.

This little door monster of mine started when I had to cover 2 hours of a later shift. My boss, the shift lead had to get ready for her other job, two the new guys had quit via no call, no show. Something that I have no doubt that you can relate to. I noticed something in my half groggy ass state of mind. The sensors we use to tell if a customer had came in would ring whenever I was nearby the doors. And before you assault me with no shit Sherlock, it was at a weirdly inconsistent range. Sometimes, I would be in the literal center of the store and one of them would go off.

This place almost completely dies off around 8:00 pm center-of-the-universe standard time. And I am trained like a hound during day shift to look towards whichever door had a customer coming through and have someone greet them. Typical hospitality, meaning when you hear the things go off and there's not even signs of the door opening. Big spook. During this day as soon as the midnight shift guy would come in. I talked about it with him, guy acted like I was talking about the most nonchalant topic possible. He says "it happens all the time to him."

Well tonight, I decided since I'm next in line for promotion and my direct Superior is moving to another store for a promotion. It's time to swoon the bosses, be big man. Except this entire shift, I have been having the weird paranoia to look outside glass doors. These doors open towards the outside so the notorious West Texas winds aren't pushing the doors open. Not to mention that tonight there's literally no wind. I know because I had to go and wake up a trucker to have him move so we can get more gas in the truck stop. 

I can tell you for certain that there is two things aside from the stores doors randomly blaring at me that have me wanting to just go home and have a good cry. It's the fact that everyone once in a while my eyes are playing tricks on me and I see a weird shadow on the reflections of the two set of doors. And also in the background where we keep a lot of our back stock I can hear something slamming on stuff. If it wasn't that I was watching a bunch of horror movies explained I'd go back there and investigate it. It seems like whatever is fucking with me on this night is enjoying my paranoia. Luckily this is a well lit trucker stop with an assortment of hardware. So if there is someone in the back of my store deciding to fuck with me, I will Hammer you nonsexually but very violently.

I keep telling myself that it's on my head or it can be explained by the average creeks and bumps you would expect from a older establishment. For the pleasant reality that in an hour and a half someone's going to come up here and look on the cameras to see me acting like a scared puppy of the thunderstorm. But the number one thing that is fucking with me right now, is I can hear a quieter ghostly version of the blaring door alarms. And I always check both doors to make sure we don't have a guest.
