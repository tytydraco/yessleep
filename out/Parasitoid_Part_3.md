Some of you may be disappointed to hear that I do not have much for this update. After the events of my last update I understand. However, my own safety comes first. Which means I’ve been laying low over the days since my last post. But, I now understand why I was asked to be here. They need me to make sure “Christ” does not die. 

Since the thing burst out of Mary the rangers have been referring to the event as the second coming. Joseph immediately had me clean the thing, and examine it. Joseph looked over my shoulder as I washed the creature. The red viscera slowly melted away underneath the warm water from an old sink. The pale skin slowly became more visible, along with the oval shaped head. Christ didn’t struggle much. In fact, it almost seemed content to be cleaned. As I cleaned around the head, my fingers gently traced over the simple mandibles. 

They were different from the normal mandibles of a larva. Usually larvae have simple mouths. Mostly used for eating soft foods. The mouth of Christ however, was more pronounced. The mandibles stretched out, forming finger-like structures. They had joints, and the point of each had something jutting from the tip. It was a fingernail. My hands began to subtly shake, as I rushed to finish cleaning the thing. I closed my eyes, and took a deep breath to calm myself.

“What are you doing?” Joseph snapped, causing me to jump. I had forgotten the man was there.

“I’m sorry.” I stuttered, continuing to clean the creature. I shifted my gaze back to the larvae’s head. My breath caught in my throat as I felt goosebumps cover my arms. Christ was looking back at me. 

The rest of that day was largely uneventful. I explained to Joseph what foods larvae can eat. Largely bits of insects and soft foods. I couldn't give a precise answer, due to not knowing what type of insect it is. Due to the larvae’s size, and lack of insects to feed it. The rangers decided to feed it chunks of cut up meat. Mary, who thankfully was still alive. Would hold Christ, as a ranger would feed it chunks of lunch meat. The larvae would reach out with its mandibles, and bring the food to its mouth. It ate voraciously, letting out a content clicking noise whenever it finished a piece. 

When it would make this noise Mary would coo at the thing. She would talk to the larvae, like a mother doting on her own baby. Even sometimes holding her finger out, to lightly rub it on the head. The only other person who seemed disturbed by these events was Declan. When the rangers would mention the second coming, Declan would cringe. The man avoided any interaction with the larva. Yesterday he seemed to have had enough. The ranger cleared his voice.

“I’m going to get some fresh air.” Declan had begun to head for the door to the Park Office, when Joseph had stopped him. I was too far away to hear their conversation. However, the look on Declan’s face was one of discontent. He eventually left the Park Office, and drove away in his truck. Joseph shook his head, and went back to Mary and the larva. 

The image of Declan’s truck reminded me of my most glaring problem. A way out of the park. I still have not see my own car. My best option would be to steal one of the park vehicles. But, due to my career being focused around understanding insects, I have no idea how to Hotwire a vehicle. I would have to steal the keys, sneak to the car, and leave. All of this while being unseen and not caught.

 I could theoretically start walking out of the park’s entrance. I could flag down someone coming to stay at the park. But, they would most likely take me back to the Park Office for the rangers to deal with. Right back into the ranger’s arms. If I began talking about giant insects, and a cult forming in the Park Office. They would think I was insane. Which in all honesty, I might be. That raises another question. How have no park visitors been made aware of the events?

My best guess is that it’s due to Christ being confined within the Park Office. But, what happens if Christ matures? The ranger’s won't be able to keep it inside the office. They’ll have to find somewhere to keep it. I have a feeling it’s not a matter of if, but when the larva grows. Christ will pupate soon. Insects already age quicker than most animals. If I had to guess, it will pupate soon. The time between when the thing in the woods laid the egg in Mary, and the emergence of Christ was less than 24 hours. It’s only been two days since the second coming. In that time the larva has grown larger. 

The crumbs of information I’ve gathered have only raised more questions. More speculation about what lies within Silver Falls. Whatever I had gotten a glimpse of, was responsible for this. It had started the second coming, and most likely was responsible for the death of the deer. I have a feeling Joseph knows what’s behind this. Is he the puppeteer or the puppet? I know one thing for certain. I need to find a way out of this Hell.
