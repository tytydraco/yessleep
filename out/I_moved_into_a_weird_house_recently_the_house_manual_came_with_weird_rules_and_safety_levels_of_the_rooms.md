[PART 1]

In December 1999, my family left our old house because of the crisis. They moved to a new town with a quieter enviroment, good structures and foundation houses that are uneasy for any robbers to break in.

"Wow, this house looks so nice", the landlord came in. "This is a pretty cheap house, your family found the best choice in this town, no one ever took this house after a incident back in the 70's, which caused the house to be cheap". My family doesn't believe in ghosts, the rumour is heavy about this house back in the 70's. A family that lived there before has been hearing giggling sounds at night, then was missing for no reason, no one saw them nor knew where they went

"Aah, im pretty sure its just rumours. People dont just disappear like that, its either they moved out". "Yea, dad said, this is the reason why people believing in ghosts dont buy cheap houses, in fact nothing would go wrong". I entered the house, there is a metal lock on the windows "use it at night" the landlord said, as we explore I found a basement, it feels shivering and cold staring at it

"Oh. I forgot to hand you a owners manual", the landlord said. This manual is to protect your safety in this house since many incidents happended in this house, its a pretty dangerous thing to break the rules, it also came with a safety level for the rooms. I started reading it
