I have been receiving dreams since I was young about a suicide prophecy I am supposed to fulfill because apparently I shouldn’t have been where I am currently located. I have dreams consistently of a “Mother” who claims to have raised me and only communicates to me in numbers insisting I travel to a 77 which is code for Montana. Other states have corresponding numbers too with my home state being 57 and neighboring states being Nevada and Idaho being 86 and 43 respectively. It only gets worse when I continue to have dreams both as I sleep and mid-day about a rainy blue twilight in a very odd neighborhood where a girl who is mostly corpse talks to me about how to kill myself as to not leave any evidence of “the facility” work. I can’t stop thinking about how weird it really is and it gets weird when I'm trying to do something only to be bothered by a number sequence and a very loud piano playing for this brief second, it seems to be playing a church hymn although I'm not familiar with it. The whole experience feels like I'm looking through a smoky mirror. These experiences have resulted in over 100+ suicide attempts and a diagnosis of psychosis but with how vivid and very distressing these are they feel so real and they feel ungodly familiar.

I started receiving these visions after I had a complete memory wipe(best way I can explain it) after a self defense incident that got me severely neglected and beat by my mother who insisted I should’ve let the female continue to beat me. I was about 9-10ish at the time and it was really bothering because it felt like this “mother” visited me in my room during this time. She told me I really upset my brothers and sisters and that I wasn’t to eat for a week until I had memorized the whereabouts of my parents firearms and the safe code to access them, I was terrified because this corpse of a woman is 1. telling me what to do to prepare to kill myself and 2. is in my room as if I didn’t make sure everything was shut and locked. This would end up being where I started marking when I could remember because I would be beat and berated for things I don’t recall or remember doing at all. I have suffered due to these memory gaps and she repeatedly tells me to come home and apologize to my brothers and sisters, an important sibling by the name of Bishop especially. She(Mother) is currently outside in-front of my driveway looking into my window and I cannot imagine what she has to say to me but I know taking my life is going to be the topic this time around and this time I’m to leave a detailed note on how to delete my documents and any account of my existence due to an organization not being able to find me and should not be able to find me due to the severity of this situation and how upsetting it truly is to be punished for things I haven’t done.

I am to leave this world by winter of this year and I have so much to do in preparation, my hard drives being the hardest thing to clean due to my only clarity as to who I am in memory gaps being present in a google document.

  
Its sad that all the work I’ve amounted to in trying to get help for this has only backfired severely.
