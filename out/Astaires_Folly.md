He is drawn in by the dark energy emanating from the incomplete circle. The closer he gets to the epicenter of this nightmarish power, the louder the numbers and sounds become. Footsteps echo. Swords clash against wood. Foreign noises, like some unknown language, reverberate through the air.

He stands around the outside of the stones, maybe ten feet back, and braces himself for the coming terror. He takes one step forward, and the brown hiking boots he wears begin to darken. Black sludge creeps up from the toes, like ink moving through veins. It spreads, consuming the area contained inside the seal. The rest of his body remains untouched—only the foot he put in to check is affected.

But it is not just his boot that changes. The incoming, almost glittering darkness—reminiscent of distant nebulae—becomes more real. It paints itself onto his leg, climbing to the shin as he crosses the boundary. This lifelike, black, otherworldly rot begins to fragment into countless shapes—mostly triangular, forms no human has ever seen.

His toes crystallize and crack. The fragments levitate before slowly disappearing into the darkness, shape by shape, pixel by pixel. The sound is deafening. His leg is gone, save for a stump at the shin. It is no ordinary stump; it has healed along the path of the fragments, leaving jagged, almost triangular cuts in the skin.

He feels the pressure now, radiating from the amputated leg. Like a balloon inflating from within, it expands outward. Terrified, he spins to survey the area, but in every direction, he sees the same view he had before. Even with his eyes closed, nothing changes. His world is fixed in this singular perspective.

Eventually, he sinks to the ground, the rest of his body a few feet back from the threshold. He hangs his head to catch his breath. When he lifts it, the inescapable view begins to vibrate, as if the fabric of another dimension is being disturbed.

From within the shadow, a dull red light grows—a liminal red in the darkness. It brightens, pulses, and he feels the pressure from before coursing through his body like a shockwave, extending into his vision.

At the center of the circling darkness, he sees a growing figure, seemingly formed from the darkest obsidian, highlighted by the otherworldly red. This creature—out of this world—rises until only its head, or whatever it is, remains. It is the most profane thing he has ever witnessed.

The noise stops. The pressure fades. The edges of his stump begin to normalize. Then it speaks—deep notes felt in every tissue of his body. The creature, ugly, terrifying, stellar, opens its mouth, and the screeching resumes, yet he hears one name clearly: Astaire.

The keeper of the stones. The man… the man whose folly cannot be undone.

Astaire was tasked with overseeing this enigma. Two previous keepers were consumed, obsessively bound to the stones. They ended their lives after similar experiences, though they never saw the shadow morph this far.

The air smells different. Doubt tastes on the tongue. Fear saturates the senses.

With what little thought he can muster, Astaire worries he may share the same fate. He ruminates as a distraction from the unchanging image around him. The figure rotates. Its head reveals wicked, fragmented horns, unlike ivory or bone—dark as the rest of it. Pulsating red glows from its center, flickering in and out of existence. The horns grow, and Astaire stands in shock, watching the shifting form.

Then… it happens.

He cannot look away. A single, grotesque eye comes into view. The rotation stops. Time seems frozen—birds suspended midair, fish trapped in water. This abomination is the only thing alive. Every synapse in his brain is claimed by its gaze.

He stares into the pupil and sees a scene no mortal should witness. Shapes and sounds climb into his skull, incomprehensible and alien. There seems to be a world unconnected to ours at the other side of this eye. He was drawn into it like a moth to flame. He gazed upon a bizarre world he has seen. Suddenly, this eye blinked. This brought the scene that was distant in the pupil right up next to ours. He looks down and notices the ground he is standing on is rapidly crumbling in foreign geometrical shapes. Realizing that the only way out of this is to enter the eye. He takes one step.
