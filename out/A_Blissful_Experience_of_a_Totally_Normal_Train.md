I was travelling by train to a different city, a journey I had taken many times before. While I could have opted for a flight, there's something about trains that captivates me. They possess a unique charm unlike airplanes. The gentle breeze from the windows touching my face always makes me feel blissful. As the rhythmic motion of the train lulled me into relaxation, I dozed off, lost in the comfort of the journey.  


When I woke up, everything had changed. The once familiar surroundings were now shrouded in darkness—not pitch black, but eerily dim as if someone had extinguished all the lights. I peered outside and noticed a sea of clouds stretching endlessly beneath us. Clouds usually offer a serene and calming view, but this time, they seemed ominous and unsettling. A chilling realization dawned on me: why were the clouds beneath us? My heart pounded in terror as I came to the horrifying conclusion—the train was flying.  


I scanned the compartment, hoping to find reassurance from my fellow passengers, but to my dismay, I found myself completely alone. Other passengers sat motionless, their faces devoid of expression, lost in an unsettling silence. Their nonchalant demeanor in the face of such madness sent shivers down my spine. I mustered the courage to approach an elderly man seated across from me. His eyes were closed, his skin sagging from his face. I reached out to wake him, but the moment I touched his shoulder, I recoiled in horror. His skin felt cold and strangely malleable, almost like clay. As I touched his face, it began to melt away, liquefying in my fingers like wax from a candle.  


Panic surged through me, and my screams echoed through the empty compartment. The horror didn't end there. I glanced at my reflection in the window and was met with a face aged beyond recognition. My skin was wrinkled and sagging, mirroring the fate of the elderly man. I ran through the train, each compartment revealing more passengers trapped in their nightmarish slumber, their bodies melting away, consumed by the terrifying reality of our situation.  
In my frantic escape, I tripped and fell hard, jolting awake with a start. 

Relief washed over me as I realized it had all been a nightmare. The train was still on its track, and I was nearing my destination. The warm, comforting embrace of the train's interior lulled me back into a peaceful slumber. As I drifted off, thoughts of reuniting with my family filled my mind, "I can't wait to meet my family," was my last thought before drifting off again, pushing the haunting images of the dream to the depths of my subconscious.
