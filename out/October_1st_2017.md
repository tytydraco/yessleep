Dear Diary,

I don't know where to begin. It feels like the weight of the world is pressing down on me, crushing me beneath its unrelenting force. I'm starting this diary because I need someone to listen, someone who won't judge me or tell me to just "get over it." Because the truth is, I can't just get over it. Not when every day feels like a battle for survival.

It all started a few weeks ago when I started high school. I was nervous, like any other freshman, but I never could have imagined just how bad things would get. At first, it was just little things—whispers behind my back, giggles when I walked by—but then it escalated, spiraling out of control until I found myself at the mercy of three girls who seemed to take pleasure in my suffering.

Sarah, Emily, and Jessica—they're like a trio of demons, haunting the halls of our school with their cruelty and malice. They've made it their mission to make my life a living hell, and so far, they're succeeding. They call me names—ugly, worthless, pathetic—and spread rumors about me that make my stomach turn. They've even gone as far as tripping me in the hallways, sending me sprawling to the ground in front of the entire school.

I try to ignore them, to pretend like their words don't hurt, but it's getting harder and harder to keep up the facade. Every insult feels like a dagger to the heart, slicing through my defenses and leaving me bleeding and broken on the inside. I don't know how much longer I can take this.

I've always been the quiet one, the girl who fades into the background while everyone else shines. I never wanted to be the center of attention, but now I can't escape it, no matter how hard I try. It's like they've marked me as their prey, their target for all their pent-up rage and frustration. And no matter where I go, they always seem to find me, lurking in the shadows like vultures waiting for their next meal.

I thought about telling someone—my parents, a teacher, anyone who might be able to help—but I'm afraid of what they'll say, of how they'll react. What if they don't believe me? What if they think I'm just being overdramatic? I can't bear the thought of being dismissed, of being told that my pain doesn't matter.

So instead, I keep it all bottled up inside, locking away my tears and my fears where no one else can see them. But the pressure is building, threatening to burst through the cracks and consume me entirely. I don't know how much longer I can keep up this charade, how much longer I can pretend like everything is fine when it's not.

But for now, all I can do is write, pouring out my heart and soul onto these pages in the hopes that someone, somewhere, will hear my cries for help and come to my rescue. Until then, I'll continue to fight, to cling to the shreds of hope that still remain, no matter how dim they may be.

I don't know what tomorrow will bring, Diary, but I know that I can't face it alone. So I'll keep writing, keep reaching out into the darkness, until someone finally takes my hand and pulls me into the light.
