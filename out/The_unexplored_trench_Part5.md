[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1ge5lhz/the_unexplored_trench_part_4/)

The submersible rose through the depths, groaning and creaking under the pressure, and the crew remained silent, every breath held like a secret. As we approached the lighter waters, a strange dread simmered around us, the weight of what we had seen clinging like a second skin. Dr. Miles sat beside me, hands clenched white around his safety straps, and Emily’s gaze was fixed unblinking on the readouts, her jaw tight with tension. No one spoke of the creature—the Abyssal Behemoth—its enormity and the vision within its eyes. No one dared mention what lay ahead as we breached the surface. Our surroundings came into view. The ocean was alight with violence. Blackened smoke trailed skyward in thick columns, filling the air with the acidic tang of scorched metal. What had once been the might of ANEX was now a graveyard. ANEX’s ships lay in tatters, shattered hulls floating like flotsam, drifting without aim. Fires crackled atop the ruined ships, their twisted frames barely recognizable, their debris spilling out as wounded giants. Above, the final swipes of helicopter blades echoed as a fleet of military choppers attempted a last assault against the impossible beast in the water. 

The Abyssal Behemoth rose above the waves, a living titan from a realm beyond our understanding.  The creatures vast body rippling with primal fury. Even from a distance, I could see its scales, dark and metallic, bristling like armor, each one reflecting the firelight from the burning wreckage around it but at the same time almost as if consuming the light withing itself. Its mouth—a vast maw lined with jagged teeth—opened to the skies as it roared, a sound that seemed to pull at the core of the Earth itself. 

“Good God…” Miles whispered, his voice hollow. “It’s wiping them out…” 

There was nothing more to say. It was as if nature itself had turned against us, brought forth in this monstrous form. The Behemoth moved with deliberate cruelty, dragging a vessel under the waves as though testing its limits, the groans of straining metal echoing as it crushed under the creature’s jaws. 

A helicopter veered close, trying to unleash one last barrage, but the creature was faster. With a flick of its tail—a muscular expanse of inky black that churned the water into a fury—it struck the chopper midair. The vehicle spiraled, its tail ablaze, before plunging into the ocean, lost amid the frothing red-streaked waves. 

Miles, Emily, and I could only watch, suspended in shock. Even if we could call for help, who would come? Who would stand against this? 

The creature paused for a moment, towering over the surface, as if taking in the wreckage around it. Then it turned its head, and for the first time, I saw the full breadth of its eye. 

It was larger than the submersible, an abyssal orb gazing outward with what looked like… galaxies. Stars. Spirals of cosmic dust and bursts of fiery color swirled within that colossal eye, as if the creature bore entire universes within its gaze. Supernovas erupted in slow motion, dying stars smoldered at the edges, and black holes swirled at the center, pulling in tendrils of light. The sheer magnitude of it left me breathless, as if I were looking into the eye of eternity itself, both ancient and endlessly furious. 

“What… are we seeing?” Emily murmured, her voice trembling. 

The Abyssal Behemoth did not blink, did not break its gaze. It was as though we were irrelevant to it, mere witnesses to its wrath. I shuddered, realizing that in the grand scale of its existence, we were less than ants. Fleeting, insignificant. 

But then, amid the wreckage, a distant sound cut through the chaos—the heavy beating of rotors. In the distance, a helicopter was ascending, fleeing the scene, and in its shadow, I saw him. General Gaines. He was alone in the chopper, his face pale and drawn, though set with an emotion I could only describe as resignation. 

“He’s leaving us,” Miles said, his voice cold with disbelief. 

Gaines’s eyes met mine for one fleeting moment before he turned away. His chopper veered sharply, climbing higher, its lights winking as it retreated, leaving us stranded. 

It was then that I noticed a familiar outline in the distance. The Eurybia, our research vessel, floated on the horizon like a ghostly apparition. There was a calm to it, an innocence that had no place in this scene of destruction. 

I caught Emily’s eye; she too had seen it. “It’s just… there. Watching.” 

The Abyssal Behemoth had noticed it as well. 

The creature turned, its massive form pivoting through the waves with a deliberateness that made my heart pound. Its colossal eyes fixed on the Eurybia, examining the vessel with an almost frightening intelligence. The distance between them closed rapidly, the creature moving closer with each passing second, its interest piqued as though it were deciding the vessel’s fate. 

Our submersible drifted helplessly, caught in the wake of its movement, a leaf in the storm of its power. The Behemoth circled the Eurybia, its monstrous form rising and falling in the waves, and for a moment, it seemed to pause, considering the ship. 

“Is it… deciding?” Dr. Miles asked, his voice barely a whisper. 

The creature gazed upon the vessel with an intensity that made me shudder. There was no malice in its gaze, but rather an inscrutable sense of calculation. It knew. Somehow, it knew that the Eurybia posed no threat, that it was not part of the attack, not aligned with ANEX’s brutal machinery. 

And yet, there was no certainty that the creature would let it stand. 

Emily’s hand gripped my arm, her nails digging into my skin as we watched. The Eurybia lay motionless on the water, its white hull a stark contrast to the darkness that surrounded it, like a dove in a field of shadows. It was a strange and heartbreaking sight, this vessel of peace trapped in a scene of war, suspended in the gaze of a creature that might erase it from existence in an instant. 

But then, the Behemoth let out a low, guttural sound that vibrated through the water, a sound that shook the core of my bones. It turned away from the Eurybia, its gaze sweeping over us one final time before it slipped back into the depths, disappearing below the waves as though it had never existed at all. 

We floated in silence, the remnants of ANEX’s forces scattered around us like driftwood, the Eurybia glinting in the weak light on the horizon. The creature was gone, but its presence lingered, an impression seared into my mind—a vision of cosmic eyes, a fury older than time, and the sense that we had only glimpsed the beginning of something beyond our understanding. 

The radio crackled to life, and for a moment, the static was the only sound in the world. Then a voice came through, weak but unmistakable. 

“Argonaut… do you read me?” 

It was Captain Lawrence. Our only hope. 

And with that, I exhaled a breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding, a flicker of hope mingling with the terror that still churned within me. We were alive—for now. But as the Eurybia drew closer, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this encounter had only been a prelude to something far darker, a harbinger of horrors still to come. 

 

The silence on the Eurybia was unnerving as we stepped aboard, the faint smell of saltwater mingling with a metallic tang in the air. The ship’s deck was empty, seemingly abandoned in the dark calm after the storm. It felt almost like a tomb—a stark contrast to the chaos and horror below the surface. The minutes stretched thinly over our heads like fragile, brittle glass as we made our way to the bridge. Dr. Miles broke the silence, his voice low and taut, “What if… what if it’s still down there, waiting?” 

Emily’s eyes darted away, avoiding the question. We all knew the answer lay somewhere out in the depths, but we were too afraid to say it out loud. 

Our fingers tapped nervously at the satellite radio, attempting to connect with those funding our expedition. Finally, a staticky voice came through. It was cold, professional, lacking even the slightest hint of concern for what we’d just witnessed. 

“This is Dr. Ellison,” I began. “We need to report what happened below. That creature—the Abyssal Behemoth—it’s not just an anomaly. It’s a threat. We barely made it back with our lives.” 

A pause lingered, followed by a crackling, emotionless reply. “Your report is noted, Dr. Ellison. We are dispatching a team to repair the damaged submersible within the next twenty-four hours. Your orders are to remain on site and be prepared for further dives.” 

“What?” Emily’s voice cut through the static like a blade, her normally measured tone laced with disbelief. “You want us to dive back down there after what we just witnessed?” 

“Ms. Thompson,” the voice replied, without any hint of sympathy, “we understand that the situation is unprecedented. However, we need you to remember that your role on this mission is to observe and document. There are… resources and personnel that have been deployed for this research, and there are critical findings at stake.” 

I felt the heat rise in my face, fingers curling into fists by my sides. “Critical findings? Are you seriously suggesting that our lives are worth risking again just to document something we already know is beyond dangerous?” 

“The repair team will arrive shortly. Until then, your orders are to continue monitoring the situation and report any significant developments. Leaving the area is not an option. Over and out.” 

The radio went dead, leaving us in shocked silence. Dr. Miles looked at me, his face drained of color. “They can’t be serious, can they?” 

“They’re serious,” I said through clenched teeth, feeling a gnawing frustration mixing with fear. 

For the next few hours, an uneasy quiet hung over the ship, our minds all drifting back to the haunting sights of the skeletal remains, the eerie bioluminescent glow of unknown creatures, and, most of all, the Behemoth. As the sun began its descent, casting long shadows over the Eurybia, the weight of our decision seemed to grow with the darkening sky. 

“I won’t do it,” Emily muttered finally, breaking the silence. “I won’t go back down there. Not if it means facing that… thing again.” She crossed her arms defiantly, her gaze fixed on the floor. 

Dr. Miles nodded, a fierce expression hardening his features. “I agree. This goes beyond any scientific endeavor. We’ve seen too much.” 

I understood their hesitation. I felt it myself, deep down. But I could already sense the futility of arguing. Our orders were clear, and I knew that without any cooperation, we’d be powerless against the higher-ups’ demands. But perhaps… perhaps, we could buy ourselves a little leverage. 

“We need to make it clear that we’re not going back in there blindly,” I said. “If they want our cooperation, they’ll have to meet some conditions.” 

Hours later, a voice came over the radio. I took a deep breath and answered. 

“Your response to our orders has been… noted,” said the same detached voice. “We’ve been advised to offer an arrangement.” 

“You want us to dive down there?” I replied coolly. “Fine. But we’re doing it on our terms. Our submersible only. No weapons, no military presence. If we’re going back, we need to minimize any threat of provoking the creature.” 

A long silence followed, stretching the suspense even tighter. Finally, the voice on the other end replied, sounding faintly irritated. “Very well. But be advised, the creature’s behavior has proven unpredictable. Proceed with extreme caution. The repair team will be there shortly. Over and out.” 

The tension lingered as the team shared hesitant glances, waiting for one of us to break the unspoken silence. 

“Guess we don’t have much choice, do we?” Dr. Miles muttered, his face pale. His voice, usually steady and calm, was taut with nerves. 

Emily sighed, running a hand through her hair. “They’re treating us like expendable assets. But if we’re going to do this… we’ll do it carefully.” 

By the time the repair team arrived, the night had fallen fully, shrouding the ocean around us in a thick blackness. Every creak of the ship, every rustle in the stillness seemed amplified, a reminder of what lay below. 

We stayed awake through the night, our nerves too frayed to even consider sleep. The enormity of our task hung over us like a storm cloud, our thoughts returning again and again to the creature. If it had observed us before, had tasted our fear, would it respond differently this time? 

The following morning, the submersible’s repairs were completed, and we assembled for our briefing. The sub sat there gleaming under the gray light, an unassuming vessel next to the monstrous enormity we had witnessed. I felt a sickening dread coil in my stomach as we prepared to descend once more into the deep. 

As the hatch sealed shut and the submersible’s systems came to life, I tried to shake the lingering anxiety, focusing instead on the monitors before us. The descent began in silence, each meter deepening the sense of dread. Only the hum of machinery accompanied our thoughts, and the ocean outside grew steadily darker, the faint shafts of light filtering from above soon dissipating entirely. 

The tension within the vessel was a palpable thing, thickening with each passing minute as we sank farther into the abyss. Emily sat beside me, her face illuminated only by the soft blue glow of the control panels. Her eyes were wide, haunted, staring into the void. 

“Do you think it remembers us?” she whispered, barely audible over the hum of the engines. 

I didn’t answer, though I couldn’t shake the unsettling feeling that we were being watched, even this far up. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the haunting expanse of the ocean floor came into view, a grim reminder of the carnage that had unfolded here. The twisted remains of ANEX’s machinery littered the seabed, their broken frames casting dark, angular shadows. 

Yet there was no sign of the creature, no distant, lumbering shape moving in the darkness. 

“Where is it?” Dr. Miles muttered, breaking the silence. 

My gaze swept over the shattered remnants, catching movement in the periphery. It was the strange crab-like creatures with elongated limbs scuttled through the debris, their bodies twisted, malformed as they tore into the remains of fallen soldiers. They moved in an unnatural, jerking rhythm, their mouths glistening with remnants of their grisly feast. 

A low hum crackled over the radio, causing us all to jump. It was the Colonel’s voice, ragged and panicked. “You need to get out of there. Now! The assault is about to begin. I repeat, get out of there immediately!” 

Panic erupted within the sub as we scrambled to reverse course. The monitors flickered erratically, the sonar pinging the behemoth. And in that moment, a shadow swept into view—a colossal shape, darker than the surrounding waters, moving with a deadly grace. 

The last thing we saw before trying to escape were the eyes, vast and unfathomable, burning with a cosmic fury, and within them, the death of stars, supernovas igniting in silence, galaxies twisting into oblivion. 

And then, nothing but darkness as we began our desperate ascent. 

The silence onboard felt claustrophobic, as if the walls themselves absorbed our breaths and whispers. We drifted in uneasy quiet, our minds tangled in the web of deceit that ANEX had spun around us. From the occasional glance and tight-lipped expressions, it was clear no one wanted to be the first to say it out loud: we were trapped here by design, bound to the whims of forces that seemed far more malevolent than we’d anticipated. 

After our initial attempt to reach out, their message was curt, leaving us with little choice but to comply: “Repairs are underway. Proceed as planned. Do not attempt an early return.” 

Emily sat beside me, her fingers tapping anxiously against her thigh, her gaze distant and haunted. “Do they think we’re expendable?” she murmured, a tremor in her voice. 

I stared intently at the radar, still grasping for something rational amidst the escalating dread. “They’re hiding something—why bring us here and then trap us? What is it they’re expecting us to accomplish?” 

Minutes crept by, each one adding another layer to our collective anxiety. Our submersible remained at the mercy of ANEX, its hold on us growing tighter with each decision we had no part in. The shadow of the Abyssal Behemoth lingered over us all, its image burning in our minds with an unsettling mix of awe and terror. 

The first detonation rattled the hull, sending us careening backward. The water around us ignited in a bloom of light and debris, the shockwaves compressing around the submersible like a vice. As another bomb exploded, the creature’s fury became tangible, its gaze locked onto us with an intensity that chilled every nerve.  

 

Detonations echoed through the water, the sound muffled yet powerful enough to rattle our bones. Another blast followed, then another, each one closer than the last. Our submersible shook as the Abyssal Behemoth twisted away from the explosions, the enormous, gnarled scales along its side lighting up in the glow of ANEX's relentless assault. The creature’s rage was unmistakable now; its massive tail lashed through the water, sending currents swirling so violently that our submersible was tossed like a toy. 

Dr. Miles’s hands flew to the controls, wrestling to keep us steady. "If they keep this up, they'll crush us in here—us and the creature!" 

Through the view port, I watched in horror as the creature turned on its attackers. With a single, colossal lunge, it surged upward, its gaping jaws snapping around one of the ANEX assault drones, shredding it in an instant. Metal fragments drifted down like snow, reflecting in our lights before disappearing into the black. 

The radio crackled, a panicked voice cutting through the chaos. "Pull back! All units, fall back! Target is retaliating! I repeat, fall—" 

The message cut off in a wave of static. Outside, the scene was like a nightmare unfolding. The creature was thrashing against the drones and smaller vessels, each of its movements a display of raw, primeval fury. It seized a submersible in its jaws, biting down with a sickening crunch before hurling the mangled wreck into the depths. 

Emily clutched the armrests, her knuckles white. “What are they thinking? They’re provoking it!” 

"Maybe that’s the point," Dr. Ellison murmured, his voice hollow. "They want to kill it at any cost… or maybe they’re trying to see how it fights. Either way, we're collateral." 

A shudder of realization ran through me. We weren’t here as scientists anymore. We were bait. 

Another bomb exploded close enough that our lights flickered, the force sending us into a slow spin. Just as Dr. Miles managed to right us, the Abyssal Behemoth turned its gaze toward our small, fragile vessel. For an instant, the glow of the distant explosions illuminated its face fully. My heart hammered in my chest as I took in its eyes, unfathomably massive spheres. 

Emily whispered, “It’s like… looking into the end of everything.” 

The Abyssal Behemoth’s eyes narrowed, and it began to circle us in an unhurried, almost predatory rhythm. We were caught in its gaze, trapped in a horrible communion, face-to-face with a creature that felt older than the ocean itself. My breath came in shallow gasps, and I could feel everyone else in the cabin frozen, transfixed. 

Then, without warning, the radio crackled back to life. It was Colonel Gaines, his voice trembling with a panic I hadn’t heard before. “You have to get out of there—now! ANEX is launching another assault with larger payloads. They don’t care about you or the submersible. Get to the surface; this is an order!” 

I reached for the microphone, barely able to steady my hand. “Colonel, that thing is right here—there’s no way we can ascend without it noticing!” 

“Then pray it loses interest,” Gaines snapped. “This creature has to be contained. You have less than two minutes before impact. Move!” 

We had no choice. Dr. Miles pushed the submersible’s engines to full power, and we began a rapid ascent. The water churned around us, the black shifting to a dark blue as we left the carnage below. Every few seconds, I glanced through the porthole, half-expecting the creature to reappear, fixed on us with that terrible, cosmic stare. 

But it didn’t come. The silence in the cabin stretched, tense and brittle. I felt a brief surge of hope, a fragile thing, delicate as glass. Maybe we’d escaped. 

The radio crackled again. “Bomb deployment imminent. Brace for impact.”
