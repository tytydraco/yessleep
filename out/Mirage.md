The house had changed again. 

The sofa was facing the wrong way. The flower vase was gone. And there was an extra pillow on my bed. 

I didn’t know if my memory was so good I remembered minute changes like this, before and after sleeping, or if it was so bad I forgot that the sofa had always been facing the other way, the flower vase was never there, and the pillow was always here on my bed. 

I banged my head back on the headboard. I had sworn I wouldn’t fall asleep this time. That I would bust whoever was pranking me. 

Because that was all it could be, right? A prank? The world couldn’t really shift just a little bit, overnight, every night, could it?

But that’s what was happening. Every day when I woke up, things were subtly different from when I’d fallen asleep. Sometimes they were minor, like an extra pillow on my bed. Sometimes I failed a subject I thought I’d passed. 

Once I found I had adopted a dog. A few days later, she disappeared - from my life and from everyone’s memories.

I was afraid to date. Afraid to get attached. Afraid to get pregnant and have kids, just to have it all snatched away in a night.

My friends made fun of my absent-mindedness. If only they knew! If only they remembered!

But no, I was the only one cursed with remembering. 

My head hurt constantly, with the dissonance forced by the changes in my world. My brain couldn’t reconcile the day’s reality with my memories. I went to a psychiatrist once, but I couldn’t bring myself to tell them. They’d just call me crazy and lock me up. 

Somedays, I wasn’t sure if I **wasn’t** crazy. What if I was, and all this was just in my head? What if none of this was real, and I was simply dreaming, strapped to a table in a mental asylum?

I quit my classes. Quit my job. I refused to get out of the house for days on end. 

The world was so pointless! Why should I do anything, achieve anything, if it could just be re-written by whomever was controlling the flow of history?

Which begged the question - who was doing this? And why? What sick pleasure did they get from tormenting me?

I decided I would find them and ask. That was the least they owed me.

But how would I find them?

I couldn’t go to them. So I decided to lure them to me. I wrote a story about how the world shifts when I sleep, and posted it on the internet, on as many sites as I could find.

I doubt they want that going public. 

Within a few seconds, I got a comment - “Take this down.” 

I ignored it. They commented again, unafraid to talk to me publicly. After all, they could simply erase everyone’s memories tomorrow. 

It was one word. A simple word, but it sent chills down my spine.

“Okay.”

And now I wait. I have pepper spray in one hand and coffee in the other. 

Come get me.
