Eight years ago, I left my sleep paralysis demon in Ireland.

I’ve always said I’m not superstitious, but the truth is—I’m a little stitious. Growing up, I don’t think I had sleep paralysis in the way people usually describe. No crushing weight on my chest, no waking with a scream caught in my throat. Just a shadow in the corner. A figure. Watching.

It never touched me. Never climbed onto my chest like it would in the movies. Instead, it lingered where it shouldn’t—doorways, mirrors, the space just out of reach of my bed. In the moments between falling asleep and waking, when I had control of my eyes but not my body, I’d see it watching. And I never told anyone.

I was raised Catholic. CCD drilled one rule into us about demons: never give them a name. Names are power. Names are invitation. So I never named mine. Never even thought of one. I gave it nothing.

But still— every so often— I’d wake to its gaze.

Recently my girlfriend bought a new plushie. A mash-up of a shark and a horse. She called it a *Hoark*.

The Warrens once wrote that Annabelle, the doll, wasn’t the evil itself—just a conduit. But they always stressed that the inhuman spirit needed permission to possess the doll. And that was the lesson. The proverbial take away of someone else's horror story:  evil can’t enter without permission.

I never gave permission.

At least, I don’t think I did.

When I was 22, and still Catholic, I went to Ireland. My group hiked Croagh Patrick, but I stayed behind, lying in a narrow bed above a chapel. I should’ve felt safe. Holy ground, after all. Instead, for the first time, it pressed down on me. My chest locked. My eyes cracked open just enough to see it crouched, head tilted, grinning. It watched me fall asleep. It watched me wake up. It watched me fall asleep again. It watched until I couldn’t tell the difference between reality and my imagination. 

And then, it was gone.

Back in the States, months passed. Then years. The demon never came back. I used to joke in my head that maybe it missed its flight. I never said it aloud. I never told anyone. In silence, I let myself believe it was over.

Until two days ago.

My girlfriend left early for the gym. I was drifting back to sleep when my body froze, my eyes fixed wide open. Movement crossed the foot of the bed. Slow, heavy. The figure slipped into the bathroom and bent over the sink, breathing ragged, staring into the mirror.

I wanted to call out my girlfriend’s name. I Couldn’t. I thought maybe it was our roommate sleepwalking. I Couldn’t speak.

The breathing grew louder. 

And for the first time, I spoke to it. I don’t know how, but I did. A gasp, a broken whisper.

“Go away.”

It wasn’t an invitation. I know it wasn’t. It was a command.

The breathing stopped. It hunched lower over the sink. And then—it spoke.

“Go away? Where?”

And then I was awake. Alone.

Last night I passed the couch and, from the corner of my eye, saw the Hoark staring. Smiling. When I looked directly at it, of course it wasn’t smiling. Plushies can’t smile. I threw a blanket over it and went to bed.

This morning, while getting ready for work, I saw it again. Watching me from on top of the blanket.

I can’t shake it. That feeling. The certainty. I know I covered it up.
