The halftime lights made everything too bright.
Fifty-yard line, midwinter chill, and eighty thousand people pretending the world wasn’t broken. The crowd pulsed like a single body—cheering, sweating, drinking, forgetting.

I sat in the private security box above the field, watching it all through bulletproof glass. The noise pressed against it like a living thing.

Lira Vale strutted across the stage below, sequins catching the floodlights like stars. Her voice carried up through the stadium, pure and piercing. For a second, I let myself listen. Not because I cared, but because it reminded me of something I couldn’t name.

Then the thought passed.
They always do.

I adjusted the scope on my binoculars, scanning the upper rigging, the light towers, the bleachers. My legs hadn’t worked in nine years, but my instincts never got the memo. I still mapped exits, checked sight lines, predicted where chaos would spill first if it ever came. It’s what kept me alive this long.

The president’s suite was just below me—glass walls, armed guards, too much confidence. Elias Stroud, the man who could smile while the country tore itself apart. He looked relaxed. Comfortable. Men like that always are before something breaks.

The song changed. Slower tempo, softer voice. Lira took a knee at center stage, lights dimming to a single blue spotlight. The crowd swayed, phones raised like offerings.

That was when my hand found the penny in my pocket. I didn’t even realize I was doing it until the copper pressed into my palm. Smooth side first, always. My thumb moved in slow circles, grounding me. The music blurred, stretched thin.

My pulse slowed—and the air shifted.

For just a breath, I wasn’t in a stadium anymore.
I was back in the desert.

Hot wind. Diesel smoke. The sound of sand hitting metal. Someone shouting my name over a radio that wasn’t working.

“Draven! Get down—”

Then fire. Heat so bright it turned everything white. The stench of burning oil. The taste of metal and blood in my teeth. And somewhere through the chaos, a voice:

	“We all carry the weight of it.”



The words landed like a ghost’s hand on my shoulder. I blinked hard. The noise snapped back—the crowd, the lights, the music. I was still in the box. Still breathing. My wheelchair hadn’t moved an inch.

“Easy,” I muttered. “You’re here. You’re fine.”

But my pulse didn’t believe it.

I rubbed the penny harder, as if I could scrub the voice off it. It didn’t work. It never does.

Below, the President leaned forward to clap as Lira hit her high note. Fireworks screamed upward, painting the sky in silver and red.

And then it happened.

Not the explosion I expected, but a single, sharp crack. A sound too precise to be part of the show.

I knew it instantly. The human body doesn’t forget that sound—it buries it, waits for it, recognizes it faster than thought.

Elias Stroud jerked once. A neat, crimson bloom spread across his chest.

The crowd’s cheer broke into a scream, the kind that rises out of the throat like it’s been waiting years for permission. Security moved, too late and too slow. The stage lights stuttered. Lira froze, mic in hand, eyes wide as the sound crashed over her.

I scanned upward, hands steady despite the noise. There—movement on the catwalk. A figure, hooded, crouched low against the glare. One arm braced on a railing. The other lowering something long and black.

A rifle.

My breath hitched.

Then the figure was gone.

I grabbed my comms.

	“Shooter on the upper catwalk, section delta-six!”



Static. The channel was dead, or jammed.

The penny slipped from my fingers and hit the floor. It spun once, catching the red light from the fireworks above. For a second, the copper glowed like blood.

And underneath the screams, underneath the chaos, I swore I heard it again—faint, broken, like a whisper buried in the stadium’s sound system.

	“We all carry the weight of it.”



The same words.
The same voice.
But that was impossible.

He was dead.
