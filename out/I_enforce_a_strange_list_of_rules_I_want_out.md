Let me preface this I’m sure you lot seen a bunch of these weird rules stories? Some crackpot list dumbass kid that barely gets out? Ever wonder why half the time it’s 5 separate monsters? Well I can’t tell you if every place is like this but this hotel? Complex? Place? I’m that thing all the monsters? Just me guess I’m a sort of shapeshifter no clue decided to keep the phone from one of the new guys that fucked up the other week rather then eat it too,



Anyway you lot are probably curious about the background mechanics and why these rules pop up, aren't you? Well sorry can’t tell you much I just showed up here one day in the roof, and I just sorta knew? What to do form there. You also all probably want to know the rules don’t you? There aren't too many 



1. **when the blue man arrives and asks for room 34 always give him the key and let him enter regardless of if it’s occupied or not:** fun one for me. The room is usually kept empty but I’m expected to eat whoever I’m there or the attendant for failing to give me the key 
2. **Between the hours of 12 and 1 all staff must remain in the break room no matter what:** iv sorta for free reign to do what I want here sometimes I don’t do anything but I’m expected to drain the blood out of em 
3. **If a woman dressed in black arrives at the hotel bar serve her any drink she asks no matter what:** this is the one that most new hires fail at lose their nerve when I ask them for real weird stuff but for some reason almost anything I ask for no matter want shows up on the bar counter no clue how it works 
4. **Employee must leave there uniforms in the staff room at the end of there shift failure to do so will result in it following you home:** never had this one happen technically I’m able to leave and follow the idiot home since no one’s failed never been told what to do..
5. **Check the security room every hour if there something standing in the boiler room turn off every light remaining in the hotel with the breaker switch and wait 20 minutes until it’s gone:** another one failed often some idiot turns on a phone light and I get to eat em 
6. **A dog may arrive and ask to speak too the manager lead it too my office I will be there:** ever had to use this one never met the manager can’t remember it being there when I got here either.

Those are the rules weird and arbitrary yeah but there all I really know, when I kill the marks collect there.. souls I guess? Weird orb things I spit up keep them in the attic they go missing from time to time. And that my friend is where the real weird shit started.



Last week, they placed hired 3 new ones 3 girls a short hair blond (SHB) long hair blond (LHB) and pink hair.



As usual spent the late afternoon watching the 3 of them as part of the walls reacted the same way everyone does when exposed to being around me start making bad decisions, works well for the hotel people make impulsive decisions spend more in the slot machines in the bar.. but it can turn… well into lunch.

Things ran as except for pink, the other two scoffed at the rules calling them stupid but pink.. pink just stared at them blankly soulless almost, the manager and janitor giving there usual speech about the rules before wandering off the janitor been here long as I can remember.. always followed the rules



SHB was the first to mess up the security room trick just stood there in the same of those internet wendigos, she didn’t turn off the lights, found her freaking out one bite solved that. Bloodless and clean gone. Other assumed she’d fallen asleep in the break room or something. 



First encounter directly with pink wad rule 3, slithering my way into the closed bar I turned on all the lights before changing into a tall woman dressed all in black funeral gown and waited. Pink approached Walking almost robotically rhythmic march stopping and staring was about to say something then I noticed the pitch black eyes like deep voids. I just stared for seconds not saying anything until Pink spoke first.



“Hello miss what can I get you” she replied in an uncomfortable smooth voice that wasn’t how people talked it was too calm like this was already her normal. “I’d like a brandy with a swallow egg” I replied started enough that I couldn’t come up with anything good.. just off the top of my head. And with zero hesitation or confusion, she grabbed the brandy from the top shell and the swallow egg from the mystery cupboard mixing them together and handing me it.

“Lovely evening isn’t it miss so quiet did you just come from a funeral? Does it happen a lot for you?” Pink asked as I drank, normally the mark would walk off by now no rules said they needed to stay just serve me.. instead she was asking questions weird ones. “No no I just like dressing this way” I replied slightly unnerved in tone.



“Surely this must be regular miss you must live around here if heard plenty of people go missing sometimes perhaps even a few minutes ago” she replied same neutral tone. At this point I just downed the drink and walked off into the shadows collapsing my firm and disappearing into the walls. Wasn’t gonna fucking deal with that. It all came really crashing down during rule 2. I started stomping around as some oger looking things through the halls making a right racket to freak out the two in the break room knocking on the door clanging the vent, only stopped when I heard the screaming form INSIDE the break room just before the hour was up. Pink walked out with a fresh uniform on.. LHB was nowhere to be seen, curiosity getting the better of me and I checked.. 

,

I fucking regretted that so damn much. I’m a clean killer swallow em all at once or suck out the blood simple shit. Pink, pink was on a whole other level, LHB found what was left of her strung up with wire between the fridge and the break room table her back peeled open spine and organs removed leaving a weird limp.. mass only holding its shape by the wires, the massive pool of blood? Well it wasn’t a pool the whole thing had already dried a congealed brown mass, and a scrawled note was  left on the mass.



“I know what you are and your game she was gonna break rule 2 anyway, decided to do it myself”



Been held up in the roof for.. god few days since then.. bare minimum shit for the rules… pink still there just going with the motions asking me weird shit if she can get me long enough too.. what the fuck do I do? Do you guys know? I want out..
