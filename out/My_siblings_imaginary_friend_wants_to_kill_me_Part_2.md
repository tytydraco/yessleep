“Are you sure we can't make Jumpy the Frog a little … friendlier looking?”

My animation supervisor was looking at my sketches, and pointing out how Jumpy’s eyes looked a little too bloodshot, and how too many veins protruded through his gray skin.

*But that's just what Jumpy looked like.*

“He can stay in the background,” I said. “ I would really appreciate it— if we could sneak him in there for the next episode.”

My anim supe frowned at the picture. “Is this like a webcomic you are trying to make viral or something?”

*It's actually some awful, real life entity I'm trying to appease so it doesn't kill me.*

“Yeah, it's a webcomic. I would really appreciate it. Seriously. Just this once”

My supe liked me and I could tell he was willing to make this small favor happen, but that still didn't wipe the look of confusion off his face.

“Okay. I'll talk to production. It doesn't need to go higher up the chain. We can just slip Jumpy in near the end of the episode in one of the crowd scenes.”

I bowed and clasped his hands.

\*\*\*

Hallelujah.

I would be seeding Jumpy’s image across a generation of kids who streamed cartoons. If that Frog said it needed believers to exist, it would now have a legion of kids who would see it, and probably wonder what that creepy frog was doing in the background of a popular TV show.

It might not happen right away, it may take weeks or months for anyone to notice, but if I could have Jumpy appear enough times to get other kids to simply *think* about the frog, I would no longer be condemned as the *sole believer.*

All I need is one fan to make a meme about it (hell I could lay the groundwork myself), and then we’d have tons of people on the internet seeing Jumpy, fan-arting Jumpy, and dreaming about Jumpy. He’ll have hordes of adherents loyal to his image.

I felt like this plan would work. Something in my bones told me so.

To celebrate, I removed all the Jumpy drawings I had put up in my apartment, and I deleted all photos from my phone.

“You’ll have plenty of believers, Jumpy! Not just me! A sea of ten-year olds will keep your essence alive!”

I was laughing, pouring myself some wine and cheersing my reflection in the mirror.

The evening was young, and for the first time in what felt like years, I decided I would go out. To a pub. A club. Anything.

I pinged a couple friends and got some suitable dancing clothes.

\*\*\*

My elevator is the glass kind that rides on the exterior of my building. I usually don’t appreciate the view, but tonight I relished the sun setting on the horizon, basking the entire city in a warm orange glow. I had found a solution to Jumpy, and I deserved a moment to appreciate the good things in life.

I admired the other skyscrapers, which framed the white capped peaks in the distance. I admired the graceful fir trees which fit in-between the downtown streets. And I admired the grimy footprints on the elevator glass that didn't block any of this magical view.

*Wait a second*. *Grimy footprints?*

The elevator jolted to a stop.

I flew several feet in the air. Fell straight on my tailbone

My entire spine was on fire for a few moments as I looked at the elevator’s little screen .*Floor 31 - SERVICE ERROR.*

What just happened?

I heard loud warbling on the elevator's glass, and there the answer presented itself. Outside, waving its massive webbed hand, was an ecstatic, smiling Jumpy the Frog.

“Whitaker sister! It’s me! It's me! It's meeee!’

Even muffled behind the glass, I could make out the high-pitched voice.

“Jesus Christ,” I said, barely able to speak. My body had frozen stiff.

“What you say?” Jumpy pressed its head against the glass. “I can't hear you.”

I collected myself, realizing how much weight Jumpy was adding to the elevator. I tried shooing with my hands. “Get off. Get off the glass!”

The frog's pupils widened and looked in two different directions. “Okays! I’ll take off the glass!”

“What? Wait. Wait!”

The amphibian applied both of its sticky hands on the glass above the elevator, creating a vacuum-tight seal. The arms lifted, flexing dozens of wiry, cord-like muscles. I could hear metal and screws pop.

The glass exploded atop the elevator.

I shielded my head as hundreds of shattered pieces fell. A few cut my arms. Crisp, thin air breezed in along with Jumpy’s jovial voice. “Whitaker sister!”

I watched as the frog clambered down into the elevator. Its skin looked healthy and green, evidently all my ‘believing’ had maybe helped heal the creature after all. I stood with my back against the closed metal door. Jumpy reached the elevator floor.

“Why are you removing Jumpy art?” The frog used a massive arm to sweep the glass away from its feet.

I could barely move. “What?”

“I sawed you remove the pictures of Jumpy in your house. Why? why? why why why?”

Although I was terrified for my life in this broken elevator missing half of its ceiling. I was now doubly creeped out that Jumpy had been watching me in my apartment? *For how long?*

The frog licked its eyes, The cheeriness from its voice fading a little. “Why. You. Remove. Drawings.”

I cleared my throat, and brushed hair out of my eyes. “Listen Jumpy, I am going to convince lots of kids to believe in you.”

The frog stared blankly.

“I’m going to get a lot of kids to believe in you, so I don't have to believe in you. This way you can outlive the Whitaker sisters. This way you can live your own life, Jumpy. I’m setting you … free.”

The frog held still, not moving a single muscle until its head tilted sideways. “But Jumpy *belongs* to Whitakers. Jumpy always helps only the Whitakers!”

“Well, I'm giving you permission to stop. You can be free. To be your own frog.” I was trying to sound confident, like the way my sisters may have commanded Jumpy.

But Jumpy didn't seem to take this well. The frog slowly cradled its face, as if such a suggestion was sacrilege. “But how is Jumpy supposed to help you then? Who do you want Jumpy to gobble up?”

“I don't need you to help me. I don't … what do you mean *gobble up*?”

“Marie-Anne and Jamie had Jumpy gobble up lots of peoples!”

*They did*? “Like … who?”

“Oh other pretty little girls. Girls who did too much talking and singing. Lots of peoples.”

I haven't mentioned this yet, but my twin sisters were rising young actors. They landed recurring roles on a sitcom and their careers only seemed to be looking up. Until the fatal car accident of course.

“I don't want you to gobble anyone up, Jumpy! I want you to be free, to go live in the pond or Forest and do whatever you like.”

“But …” The frog lowered its gaze and approached me“... Jumpy *likes* gobbling. Please tell Jumpy who to gobble.”

I couldn’t back up any further than the elevator door. “Fish! Worms! Whatever normal frogs gobble up. You go gobble that.”

Jumpy pressed one of its sinuous fingers against my belly. “Oh but you can think of some juicy, jiggly peoples for Jumpy to gobble up. There must be someone you don’t like.”

I closed my eyes, sealed my mouth. The moldy fruit breath was overwhelming.

“Tell Jumpy who to gobble.”

I shielded my face. “Please Jumpy. I don’t have anyone. I don’t want you to eat anyone.”

The breath retreated. Its voice turned disappointed. “You don’t have … anyone?”

“No. It’s not good to eat people, Jumpy.”

When I opened my eyes, the frog was turned away. It placed one of its massive hands on the glass wall.

“You don’t want Jumpy to be happy …” The frog bonked its head along the glass, penalizing its own sorrow. The glass cracked a little bit.

“No, I want you to be very happy! I just want you to discover a new source of happiness that isn’t … gobbling.”

The frog bonked its head on the glass again. “Marie-Anne and Jamie told me you wouldn't understand Jumpy. Maybe they were right ...”

The remaining walls of glass were growing cracks at an alarming rate. If they broke, I would be completely exposed at thirty one stories above sea level.

“Please Jumpy! I understand everything! Maybe I can find you, like, I dunno, a people meat substitute? Have you tried pork?”

Jumpy ignored me, and climbed back to the opening up top. The glass was spider-webbing everywhere

“Sorry Whitaker, Jumpy must eat peoples. There is no choice.”

Pops and snaps came from all the walls around me. I turned to hug the elevator door as close as I could.

“I’ll just wait for your kids,” Jumpy said. “I’m sure one of the childrens will have lots of gobble ideas for Jumpy.”

Before I could reply, the frog hopped away, climbing along the side of my apartment building.

Then, the glass around me fractured in aggressive zigs zags until … *SNAP! CRACKLE! POP!*

Shards fell like a waterfall.

Bits shot at my back and neck.

Within seconds, the glass walls around me were gone. I could feel the cold, atmospheric wind rippling through my clothes.

The platform slanted from the weight of the glass. I rolled once or twice before digging my nails into the floor.

I was at least four hundred feet in the air, completely at mercy to the elements. If the elevator jolted in any direction, I would certainly roll off the ground platform and plummet.

*Oh god. Please don’t move, please don’t move, please don’t move, please don’t move …*

\*\*\*

Screams would erupt uncontrollably as the elevator jiggled every now and then. I’m not ashamed to admit that I soiled myself.

Birds cawed at my panicked form. The twin elevator would rumble past me, causing my whole platform to tremble too. I was in my own private hell for forty five minutes until the fire department showed up.

It felt more like six hours.

When they finally did manage to pry open the elevator door and pull me to safety, they announced I had no real injuries, only a couple of minor scrapes. But I was trembling so much from fear, that they took me straight to the hospital. The paramedic said I looked like I had seen a ghost.

I stayed the night, unable to sleep.

They even kept me the full next day because my heart rate still wouldn’t go down.

“You’ve got to relax, you’re safe now,” one of the nurses said. And I told them, “I know, I know, I’m doing my best.”

But what I didn’t explain was that I was absolutely petrified that a horrible frog monster could come back and kill me. I had only met Jumpy twice in my life now, and both times it felt like I was staring death in the face. Even if it was by accident, the frog could easily hop on me, choke me or toss me down a flight of stairs without intending to murder me.

Jumpy was too callous, too oblivious in regard to preserving any human life… and then I realized I would soon enable kids to see Jumpy.

I would be allowing minors to not only risk their lives meeting the frog, but also risk the lives of others by letting him *gobble*.

I had sent the wheels in motion for a Pandora’s box to open via children’s television across the internet, across the entire world. The frog could terrorize the lives of countless kids for eternity because they would all believe in and fear it. Bullies would abuse Jumpy. Parents won’t know what to do. I would be creating a real life boogeyman.
