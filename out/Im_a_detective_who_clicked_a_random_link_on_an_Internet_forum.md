The sound of the clock’s loud chimes snapped me out of my intense focus. I glanced away from the monitor in front of me. The clock had rang midnight. I had just finished finalizing paperwork. The case I had finalized wasn't as exciting as I'd hoped. When it came to my job as an investigator, I preferred something more thrilling.



"I'm headin' out. you fine on your own, Anthony?'' I heard a voice say from behind me. I spun my office chair around and found myself being greeted by an officer, his tall muscular frame leaning against the wall, coffee in hand.



I flashed him a tired smile. "Don't worry about me, Dave. I'll be alright." Dave nodded and shut the door behind him. The room returned to silence.



I usually left the office pretty late, but not this late. Dave leaving meant I was the last one in the building. The building was small and didn't have many people working there to begin with, but it was still unsettling at night. Yes, I’m a 26 year old man who is still afraid of the dark. It didn’t help that the light in my office liked to flicker occasionally and make this loud buzzing sound. I really needed to replace it.



The thing that had been distracting me from making my way out the door was still displayed on my desktop. It was an internet forum post. Scrolling through forums was something I did in my free time when I finished my work for the day (sometimes when I hadn't finished my work too, hence why I stay late most nights), and I found something that had instantly caught my attention. 



"Hello, this is the Destiny Church. We are contacting you to see if you are interested in taking part in our practices. Click the link below for more information." The post showed a screenshot of a message conversation with that being the first thing sent to the receiver, followed by what was most likely the link, although the poster scribbled it out in red, along with the church’s number. 



The caption above the screenshot was a frantic poster ranting about the situation. “I received this message earlier this week. When I clicked the link it brought me to a fairly normal looking website, showing very little information about this church. After looking at the website for not even a few minutes, the number sent me a message telling me my exact address. I closed out the site and blocked the number directly after. When coming home from work I’ve had this dreadful feeling that someone is watching and following me. I don’t know if this is just an internet joke and I’m being paranoid, or if something seriously bad is going to happen.” Reading that last line sent a chill running down my back. I don’t know why though. The poster probably was just paranoid.



I clicked on the person’s profile. Their profile displayed nothing but that post. On the side bar it showed they made their account in 2018, just a few years ago. The post was made last week, so I found it odd they hadn’t posted anything before that. 



The comments were nothing out of the ordinary for the internet. Some people were cracking jokes, a few insensitive, but still receiving copious amounts of likes. “It’s just some guy with no life on the internet trying to scare you” or “Why would you click a random link you were sent anyway? You deserve whatever’s coming” were recurring themes. One comment was a little different from the rest. “This shit looks sketchy. Explore at your own risk.” The person provided a link, most likely the link that the original poster wanted to hide for our safety. I mean, it’s a public church so I doubt it’d be that hard to find the website. I’m curious as to why the person who posted it scribbled out the link address anyways.



I hovered my mouse over the link. I doubted it was anything actually dangerous. Over time I’ve learned never to trust most things on the internet, but I will admit I was curious. I paused and started thinking about the possible outcomes but in the end, It could be fun to investigate. I tried not getting involved in internet investigations because most of them seem to turn out bad. The internet tends to do a lot more harm than good.There were only about a hundred views, so I doubt it would become that big.



I pressed the link.



A black screen filled my monitor. I tapped the space bar multiple times and continuously clicked my mouse, as one usually does when a computer freezes. Nothing happened for a few minutes. I ducked my head under my desk to turn my computer tower off, but was greeted with a much different version of my tower. I jumped up, knocking my office chair to the floor. Underneath my desk was a mess of sparking wires and a strong scent of burning plastic. I nearly tripped while running out of my office in search of the fire extinguisher.

	

There’s a first time for everything. Using a fire extinguisher was not a first time I expected to experience today. It took me an embarrassingly long amount of time to get the extinguisher and put the fire pit of hell out that was brewing under my desk. Lets just say my computer no longer looked like a computer, and there was definitely no way it was turning on again. Clicking the link was just a coincidence. It had to be. My computer must have been overheating for a while and I didn’t notice until it caught fire.



I dropped the extinguisher and fell to the wood floor, sitting a few feet away from the charred pile of melted parts that was once my computer. I sighed and closed my eyes. I’m starting to think I should have just gone home.



It took a few minutes of sitting there and contemplating all of my life decisions before I finally decided to leave. I opened the front doors leading out to the parking lot. My hair was becoming messier as the cold breeze blew through it. People in high school often said I was tall and thin enough to be knocked over with a slight breeze, which I’m starting to agree with after being so easily knocked off my feet by this wind.



The parking lot was big, similar to how a grocery store’s parking lot is. Although I was the only one still in my building, the lot was shared, meaning there were still few cars left. Dave often checks on me most nights even though he works in the building next to mine. I started working here fresh out of college, almost two years ago at this point. Nobody really took me that seriously. No one ever really does when it comes to people fresh in the field. Dave was the only one who made an effort to get to know me. I really appreciate him.



Crickets and the buzzing of the street lamps were the only sounds filling the air. The moon was barely visible through the dark, ominous looking clouds. I flipped through my keys searching for the one for my car. 



A flash of light along with a loud alarm startled me. The car I had been passing by started to go off like crazy. After a few seconds of me standing there frozen, it stopped. I bent down to pick up my phone and keys I had dropped. My phone had a large crack running across the screen that definitely wasn’t there before. Today is really not my day.

I could feel the weight lifting off my shoulders when I finally returned home. It was 3am by the time I got in bed. My apartment was very small, only made for one person. It was hard finding a well sized, reasonably priced place in the middle of New York City.



I tossed and turned in bed for about an hour or so. I couldn’t scratch away the thought of getting up and looking into that link again. Look, I’m not one of those people who believes in outrageous conspiracy theories or anything supernatural. I want to convince myself it was my computer overheating. It’s just too odd that the moment it caught on fire was right after I clicked the link.



I tore the covers off and jumped to my feet. After grabbing my laptop, I sat at the foot of my bed. I opened my laptop, a picture of me and my mother when I was younger appeared on the front screen. A lump caught in my throat while looking at the bright background. I should really change it. I opened the page and found my way back to the post. A quick copy and paste later and I sent the link to my brother along with a description of what happened after I clicked it the first time. 



Aaron was a smart guy. My brother taught me everything I know when it came to computers and programming, although I’ll never be able to do what he does. When we were younger he’d pirate hundreds of dollars worth of video games without ever getting close to being caught. He was only 15 years old at the time, which has always impressed me. When I was 15 I barely knew how to tie my shoes. I seem to have been the one looking up to him even though I was older. I haven’t talked to him much since I graduated high school and left immediately after. The last time I saw him was at mom’s funeral months back. I’m still hoping he wants to hear from me. Half my reasoning for emailing him is out of curiosity about the messages and the link, the other half is wanting to get in contact with him again. I’ve been too scared to reach out without a good reason.



I sat there waiting for a new message for ten minutes. Aaron was always on his computer so he should have at least seen it by now. I was about to close my laptop and try falling back asleep until I heard a pinging sound. A message reply popped up.



“You need a dark web browser to even access the website. You said your computer exploded right? Could have installed a virus to your computer when you clicked it. I thought I taught you better about this stuff. What are you getting yourself into?” Aaron’s reply ended there. 



My eyebrows furrowed and my mouth was slightly agape. I was confused. What had I gotten myself into? I was surprised to hear myself laugh at that. I guess I found the situation a little funny. I would say always expect the unexpected, but I should have expected this from the start. 



“Tell me how to get to the site,” Probably the stupidest thing I could have replied with.



Aaron and I messaged back and forth for a while. I could tell he was worried about my safety, which was a little relieving. He knew no matter what he said I wouldn’t listen. I had clearly set my mind on this and he knew that.



After a while, I was able to get on the site. When I was finally on, it felt anticlimactic to say the least. It looked like a normal website like the original poster had described. The page had a simple white background with a few pictures of a church with an ugly green roof, followed by harsh black text displayed throughout. The text wasn’t understandable. The words looked like filler text not meant to be an actual message. I was starting to get even more suspicious. I began to scroll down the page. After the first page, the rest were blank. I progressively began scrolling faster, but there seemed to not be an end. I zoned out and stared at the white pages flying by. 



I was getting bored.



Then the page changed completely. I reached the end. I don’t think ‘end’ was the right word for it though. It brought me to a whole different tab. The screen was black again and I felt my anxiety instantly peak. Memories of the computer fire earlier started flooding back. The computer didn’t catch on fire however, Instead bright red text began to appear on my screen like a typewriter. The words read “W.H.Y A.R.E Y.O.U H.E.R.E?,” Maybe a fire would have been better than this. The text disappeared and was replaced with new text. “L.E.A.V.E,” was the last thing I saw before my laptop shut off completely.



To my surprise, It did turn back on. No fire, but the page wasn’t there anymore. Nothing was there. My whole laptop had been wiped clean. Maybe I should have listened to Aaron.

Pulling into work the next morning felt off. I had to move to a different office down the hall due to mine being in repair. My boss ended up believing the lie I told about how my office caught on fire. I hadn’t told anyone the whole story of what really happened that night. That might have just been my downfall. 



I continued my work as if it were any other day, because it was any other day. I didn’t believe there was any real danger since nothing had presented itself physically. I’ve gotten myself into all sorts of different dangerous situations in the past. This isn’t anything I can’t handle.



I spent hours straight reviewing and filling out paperwork. Saying it was boring was an understatement. I put on some peaceful music in the background to drown out the unwanted silence. The flow of work stopped when I heard a knock on the door. I looked up and made eye contact with a small lady trying to quietly open the door to my office. I raised an eyebrow. I wasn’t expecting any visitors.



“H–Hello,” The woman stuttered, a frightened expression on her face. “I’m Natalia.”



I greeted her and made a motion for her to sit on the chair in front of my desk. She looked fairly young, probably around my age. Her long blonde hair was set into two braids resting on the sides of her shoulders. A deer in headlights is what her big brown eyes reminded me of. Something had clearly frightened her.



After averting her eyes and shuffling in the chair for a while she spoke, “I’m sorry to interrupt your work. An officer at the police station told me you’d be the best person to ask for help.”



“Don’t worry about it. I wasn’t busy anyway. What can I help you with?” I tried sounding welcoming. The tears welling up in her eyes made it hard not to.



“Well, my um,” She paused to take a deep breath. “My son. He went missing a few months ago. The police concluded it as a runaway.They won’t reopen the case but I know my boy I know he wouldn’t run away”



“Can you describe your son for me?” I flipped a pad of paper over and clicked my pen.

	

A few tears started rolling down her face. “His name is Toby. He’s only eight years old. He was always smaller than other kids his age. I’m sure he’s the sweetest boy anyone could ask for.” The way she talked about him sounded genuine and sad, “I feel I’ve failed as his mother. Detective, please help me find my boy.” 



I questioned the mother a while longer. A feeling of grief lingered over our conversation as we talked about her son. I had only a photo of him to go off of. His smile was as bright as his eyes. His neat brown hair was gelled back and his school uniform popped with white and green. I thought it’d be very difficult to find him with only a photo and already a few months of him being missing. Well, that was until the mom spoke again. 



“There was always this one place in the woods he loved playing at. I’ve been checking it every day hoping he’d go there, but he never has,” A sorrowful smile crowded her features. She took out her phone to show me a photo of him at the place. Toby was sitting on a log, smiling in front of a building. An oddly familiar building. I grabbed the phone from her hands, leaving her with a shocked expression. My mouth hung open as I stared in disbelief. Unbelievable.



Behind the boy was a church with an ugly green roof.



\*



I found myself walking in the forest the next day. I walked deeper into the wooded area, progressively getting farther from my car. The sun was just starting to set, so I had to do this fast. 



For the next few minutes I followed the directions Natalia had written down for me, until I reached it. Before me was the infamous church. The green roof looked slightly better in person, but still pretty ugly. I walked around the perimeter of the building to inspect anything I could. No sign of the boy. I was avoiding walking into the actual church. An ominous aura was radiating off the building. I had a very bad feeling about this. 



The boards creaked loudly with each step I took. I paused at the entrance of the church to take in my surroundings. It looked very old and run down. The white paint was chipping off the wood walls. Benches sat in rows along the sides of the church. There were a few holes in the roof, those being the only source of light. 



As my eyes roamed around, they quickly stopped when they saw a flat white object resting next to one of the benches at the front. I cautiously approached it. My shoes splashed through the puddles on the floor of the church, most likely left by the rain from the day prior. The closer I got, the more apparent it became that it was a piece of paper. I bent down to pick it up. It was folded in half, the front reading “To Anthony Brier”. My heart dropped when I saw my name written across a random piece of paper located in a church in the middle of the fucking woods. 



A whimpering sound from in front of the bench caused me to drop the paper. 



“What the—” I said aloud as I leaned forward to inspect the bench. On it was a small boy in a school uniform. It was Toby. I frantically crawled in front of the bench to assist the boy. His once white shirt was soaked with red. Oh god what happened.



 “Toby! Toby, can you hear me? Stay with me, okay?” I took off the black hoodie I had been wearing and used it to soak up some of the blood. 



“I don’t wanna die,” Toby whispered, trying to save what little breath he had left.



“You’re not gonna die, Okay? I’ll get help, just stay here!” I sprung up from the wood floor and sprinted outside. I swung my head from left to right in search of a person. My phone was still being repaired so I had to find someone who had one. Tears started to build in my eyes from the overwhelming situation I found myself in. My focus shifted to a person. Thank fucking god. 



My relieved expression dropped completely when I noticed it was a group of people. Not a single face could be seen. Dark cloaks were worn among the figures and hoods covered their faces. What the hell.



I backed away from the group, making my way inside the church again. I ran over to Toby. “Toby?” His eyes were closed. I shook his shoulder in hopes of waking him up. “Toby, please you have to wake up buddy. We need to get you home. Your mother is worried sick.” My efforts were useless. He was gone. 



I sat there in silence for a moment trying to process what had happened.I remembered the paper that was still on the floor. I inched my hand over to the paper now stained with blood. Unfolding the paper, the page had neat cursive handwriting across the inside.



“You killed him. This is your fault. You shouldn’t have been nosey and gone to our website. It’s not meant for you. You’ll make a perfect cover up though, won’t you?”



I stared at the words for a few moments, trying to keep my emotions under control. I can’t do this. This isn’t real. Suddenly the door swung open and police started flooding the room with their guns drawn. 



“POLICE! GET UP AND PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD,” One of the officers yelled. “YOU’RE UNDER ARREST FOR THE MURDER OF TOBY EASTON.”



I got up slowly and did as they said. This all felt like a dream. Just this morning I was going about my day at work and now the police are pinning me to the ground and handcuffing me. Everything looked like it was in slow motion. I looked over at the paper. That paper would help me get out of this, right? 



Smoke. Outside the window was one of the hooded figures with a lit match emitting smoke. The police had their backs to the window so I was the only one who saw. As I tried to warn them, one of the officers put his hand over my mouth to stop me from speaking. The person in the window took their hood off to reveal their face. My eyes went wide and my jaw would have dropped if it weren’t for the man keeping it shut. Toby’s “mother” smiled at me before throwing the match through the window. I had been lied to. They used me.



It wasn’t water. The puddles were actually gasoline. Flames spread through the building in an instant. The officers noticed and dragged me out as quickly as possible. I watched as the fire covered the church. Toby’s body was still inside. I couldn’t hold back the tears anymore. I wanted to scream. The officers didn’t even care to keep this boy’s body from burning. I would have rather them left me there to die than let the body of an innocent child burn.



The officers were too focused on getting away from the fire to notice the people with hoods flee into the forest. The officer guiding me shoved me inside a cop car. I took a deep breath and tried to think of a way I could prove my innocence. The blood was still on my hands after all. If this is some sort of weird cult operating on the dark web this could be a pain in the ass to get out of.



“Anthony?” A man’s voice came from the front seat.



“Dave…” I whispered.



Dave’s stunned expression turned into a frown. His eyes looked different. He stared at me in pure disgust and confusion. The only guy who talked to me and made me feel actually useful was convinced I murdered an eight year old boy in cold blood. 



The car engine started and Dave didn’t speak another word to me. I turned my head to look out the car window. I sat watching as the burning church got farther and farther behind us. The image of Toby’s bloody face couldn’t leave my mind. The way he gripped onto me in his last dying moments. I wanted to help this boy and what I thought was his mother, but now everyone thinks I’m responsible for his death. Would Toby still have died if I didn’t click that link?



I’m sitting awaiting trial. How am I supposed to get out of this?
