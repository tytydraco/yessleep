  I looked at the door with a mix of confusion and anger. Jeff, my friend and neighbor, looks at the door with me.


  The door looks old. Not lije the rest of the house which is nice and clean. But this door looks dirty and crusty. Something you would find at a abandoned house.


  "I'm with you man I don't think I've ever seen that door there before". Jeff says. 


  I let out a deep breath trying to calm myself down as I unclench my fist. "So I ain't crazy there is a litteral door right there on the stairway?" I ask him again.


  As if to proof my point he goes up to the door and taps on it. 


  "You think I should call the contractors or the bank?"


  As Jeff was just staring and studying the door he looks again at me. "Maybe the contractors" "I don't know man". He says this generously. He knows how pissed I am amd is trying not to make me make a fool of myself.


  "Well I'll guess I will call the contractors tomorrow then. Thanks man sorry if i sounded angry on the phone". I tell him as we head to the door. 


  "It's cool man. I'd be angry too of I found another door in my house". He then heads back to his house on the left. 


  I shut the door as I'm now feeling relaxed. I wonder how Sarah would react to this whenever she gets home? She would probably react the same as I did. Good thing she went out for groceries and i came back from the book sale at the Barnes and Noble. 


  Before I lock the door I write a note and put it on the front door for Sarah. 


  I then go up the stairway with a now existing door on it which I'm still confused about. As I get in the warm shower I start thinking of after dinner to see what was inside it. You hear alot of crazy stories of people finding another person living in their house.


  When Sarah comes back from the store I show her the now there door. She says that she agree's with me and ask me the question i was hoping she'll ask. 


  "You want to open it?" She looks at me smiling with them daring eye's of hers. 


  I smile at her as if to say I accept her challenge and reached my hand towards the doorknob and open it. My heart beating with anticipation. As my hand turns the doorknob it stops halfway. 


  I frown as i realized it is locked.


  I look at my wife and ask her if she has seen a key that we don't have kind of like the door. She shakes her head no. 


  Sarah then tells me that she is going to get ready for bed and kisses me on the chick playfully. As I watch her go upstairs I then turn my attention back to the door.


  Why is it locked? Why did we just now notice it if it has been here before? 


  I then hear my wife holler at me from upstairs to go to bed. As i go up I take one last look at the door that seems out of place and then go upstairs. 


 ***************************************


  Knock, Knock, Knock.


  I hear the knocking while I was sleeping and got up. 


  I look at my wife to see if she was also awake but she isn't. I then get up and go out into the dark hallway and look with my heart beating down the stairs.


  Knock, Knock, Knock.


  I hear the knocking but this time it sounds a bit louder. I then went down the stairs and look through the keyhole of my front door. I see no one there. 


  My heart suddenly starts beating. It's the feeling that you get when someone else is inside your home. 


  I grab a kitchen knife from the knife stand and search the house. I see nobody except me and my wife. I raise the knife down as I feel a bit relieved but the hairs on my body are still standing up. 


  KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!


  I jump as I hear the knocking again except it's louder than the other ones. I then pay my attention towards the door that just appeared yesterday. My heart beating as I hear the new door shake as the knocking continues.


  KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!


  I drop the knife in my hand as I suddenly start shivering. My body moving uncontrollably as I walk towards the banging door. 


  Why isn't Sarah awake? I think in my head. 


  My hand moving with a force that isn't my own touches the doorknob and starts to turn. I smile remembering that the door was locked because there was no key to it. 


  With my heart beating like it was going to come out of my chest and my body feeling tense the door somehow opens up. 


  My heart drops as I see a endless plane of shadow in the room. It looks like it could go through miles. 


  With the door still creaking open one of my feet take a step foward. I realized that I'm being drawn into this infinite realm of darkness.


  Sarah! Sarah! My mouth trys to move but it can't. 


  Why ain't she getting up? I say to myself inside my gead as I feel like I'm going to cry. My left foot then follows the right one and the cycle continues. 


  It feels like time is moving slowly as I am walking. Like I'm going towards the Green Mile. 


  My eye's are beginning to swell up. I take what I think is my final steps in and the door slams shut with a loud BANG! I then feel the force leave my body as I cry out in fear. 


  I then hear Sarah shouting my name as I look towards where the door had been. 


  "Mike! Mike!" She yell's worried about me. 


  I scramble towards the door and yell back at her. "Sarah! Sarah honey can you here me!" 


  "Mike! Where are you?! Where is that door?!" 


  I slump down on the floor of darkness as I realize that the door is no longer there. I continue to hear my wife yell for me as she is banging on the spot the door used to be. 

With nothing else too do I cry myself to sleep. 


  If you are wondering how I'm typing this I found my phone in my pocket. I'm going to send this message to anyone I can in hopes of fimding me again. There should be more people here. Should be more doors. 


  Sarah my darling if you are one of the people reading this I love you and i will get back too you. 


  As to the people that are not Sarah, if you one day notice a door that isn't there before. Wait till nightfall. When you hear the banging coming from your new house addition please open it.
