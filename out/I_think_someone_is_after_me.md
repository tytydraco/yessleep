 

Hi! My name is Vee. I recently lost both my grandparents, Minachi and Perumal, due to Covid-19. I never had a good relationship with my parents and had always been closer to my grandparents. Even though I haven't seen my parents for over a decade, we do talk on the phone and even Whatsapp each other funny memes from time to time. I have always wanted to, but my grandparents always suggested against it.

I would be lying if I said I didn't miss them, but I survived over ten years without seeing them, so I reckoned I would be fine if I didn't see them for another 20 or so.

Coming back to the present, after my grandparent's death, I was deeper into depression, and my social anxiety was severe. That's when I decided to adopt a pet cat named Zen. She was the furthest thing from Zen, but having her with me calmed me. Her crazy misused my crazy, I always said.

She was the 'purfect' pet. Hahahaha, I just had to make that pun. We had the best time together, especially during the second quarantine we Malaysian had. We did everything together. We would eat at the same time, watch a horror movie, and even do our skincare together. 

I would always tell her that she has to sleep outside, but she always ends up on my bed and asks for snuggles.

Since this is Nosleep, you can bet things stayed peachy for a short time. One day, I was playing with bubbles with her favorite feather toy. **Let me add a picture of it for context.**

She hid under my bed and started playing with it. I could only see her paw grabbing the feathers and found it more entertaining than any shows I watched. I heard a scratch at the door and turned to see Zen looking at me wide-eyed.

She sat there waiting for me but didn't enter. It was still afternoon, so I was still pretty brave; I knelt and looked under the bed to see a pair of red eyes looking back at me. I could see a grin and sharp white teeth, but I couldn't make up the face.

I always wondered what I would do in situations like this. Would I faint? Or would I wake up and realize it's just another dream? Or would I scream for help? I, instead, calmly stood up, took my handbag, and carried Zen into my car. 

I drove straight to a nearby temple and informed a Hindu Priest of this incident. He looked at one of his assistants and me.

" We can come over and take a look. Did you purify your house before moving in?" The assistant, who introduced himself as Pandi earlier, spoke. 

" With turmeric and everything, I even had another Hindu Priest do the ritual for me," I answered. " This was about three years ago, a day after I moved in."

" Okay, we can't come immediately since we have prayers to attend to, but I can come tomorrow at 10 am. Do stay somewhere else for tonight." He said, and I obliged. 

I booked a hotel room for the night. Usually, in situations like this, I confide in my grandparents or best friend. My best friend, Sam, was already worried about her family member suffering from Covid, and I did not want to add to her worries.

I tried calling my parents instead, and they didn't pick up. I texted them, no reply as well. I decided to sleep with Zen lying at my feet, and I felt safer just being around her. 

I woke up to Zen licking my hand.

" Do you need food?" I asked. She kept licking. I got up and turned the light on to check her food and water. She has enough. I stroked her a few times and asked her what was wrong; she just looked at me wide-eyed. 

I rechecked my phone, no reply from either of my parents. I found this odd as they usually reply almost immediately.

I started patting Zen again. It was dark, but I could feel it beside me, purring. I turned to face her and got shocked. 

I was back in my house. I got up, turned the lights on, and saw my room rather than the motel room. Zen was also next to me. I got out of my bed and looked around. I wasn't sure if I was dreaming, but it felt real. 

Suddenly, moldy fruits fell from the ceiling to my bed. The first thing I thought was, *What the fuck?* That startled me for a second, but I didn't want to wait to figure things out. I ran out of my apartment to the lobby and borrowed the security guard's phone to call my best friend to pick me up. 

I waited in the lobby with Zen for her to pick me up. Sam came to pick me up within 15 minutes, and we drove to my hotel room. I explained what had happened, and she was thankful, not accusing me of hallucinating or being crazy. I am so grateful for her. I also told her that I had contacted my parents but had yet to receive an update from them. 

She assured me that they were probably just busy. I asked her to stay over, and she obliged. 

"I forgot to tell you, and I also had moldy fruit fall from nowhere to on top of my bed back at my place. " I added as we were getting ready for bed.

"Huh, fruits?" She asked. " Was the hole or something on your ceiling?"

"No, it just fell on the bed from nowhere."

She thought for a while. 

"What's your house number?" She asked.

"4; why?" I answered. " Don't you dare suggest something is wrong with the house? I have been staying there alone for three years."

"Yeah. The number 4 is associated with death, but you have lived there too long without disturbance." Sam said. Zen jumped on her and started licking her hand. "She is so cute; I wish my mom would let me get a cutie like her. "

"Hahaha, yea, she is adorable. I honestly think I am this brave cause of her." I said. 

" How long have you had her again?" She asked. 

" For a week now. " I answered, starting to pat Zen. 

"Hmm, could it be that she brought some weird ghost with her?" Sam suggested.

I thought about it for a moment, but that still didn't make sense. Sam also insisted that moldy fruit from my ceiling didn't make sense, either. That night I slept thinking about what Sam said.n I could see Zen sleeping at the end of the bed and Sam beside me. Having them both made me feel safer, and I didn't have much disturbance for the entire night.

The following day, I woke up early, and Sam and I drove to my apartment to see the Indian priest and his assistant waiting for us. Thirucelvam and Surya introduced themselves, respectively. We exchanged some pleasantries as they both asked me for basic information about how long I had been staying they and other information so they could proceed with their check.

Thirucelvam walked in and calmly looked around. He walked straight to my room and asked my permission to look around, and I allowed it. He walked in and scrunched his nose as if he smelled something terrible. He instructed his assistant to sprinkle some turmeric water all over the house. 

The water hid the floor and started sizzling as if the floor was hot. Sam looked at me, terrified. 

"What's that?" Sam asked.

"This usually happens if there is an ill intention towards you, and I haven't seen anything like that for years. " The assistant explains. He guided us out of the room as the priest was still inside the room, and he looked around as if he was looking for something.

"Do you have anyone who doesn't like you?" He asked me. 

I took a second to think and told him yes, who doesn't?

He asked if I had someone who might hate me so much that they would go to difficult lengths to send malicious entities toward me.

Sam and I looked at each other, and I said no. Thrirucelvam exited the room with an odd flower arrangement with him. 

He explained that he found this under my floor, and I am still determining where or what that even is. 

He explained further that someone had placed this here to wish harm on me. To weaken my physical energy and invite malicious spirits to me.

I couldn't think of anyoneâ€”the thought of someone being in my apartment without knowing started me. I don't think I could feel the same in my place.

The priest continued that he would cleanse my energy and that the best thing was to move house. I immediately looked for Airbnb to stay at and found a few good options. 

I decided to stay at the hotel till then. The hotel had multiple CCTV and security that assured me that no one could get into my room.

I will try to add more accounts to this story. It is not done yet, but there are a lot of things that I am still investigating.
