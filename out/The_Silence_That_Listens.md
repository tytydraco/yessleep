When my family moved into the old farmhouse on the edge of town, I expected creaky floors and drafty windows. What I didn’t expect was the silence—thick, suffocating silence that seemed to press against you, almost as if it was listening. It wasn’t just the absence of sound, it was the kind of silence that felt alive, something more than just the natural quiet of an old, isolated house.

At first, it was unsettling, but I brushed it off. The house was ancient, after all, with peeling wallpaper, and the smell of damp wood clinging to every room. It had stood empty for years before we moved in, so it wasn’t surprising that it felt… different. But the more time we spent there, the more the silence became impossible to ignore. It clung to you like a shadow, like it was waiting for something, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that we weren’t alone.

The usual noises you’d expect from a house like this—the wind rattling through loose panes, the soft creak of wood settling, distant animals in the woods—were absent. It felt as though the entire area had been drained of life. Even the faint hum of electricity was muted, almost as if the house was holding its breath, waiting.

My younger brother, Ben, was the first to notice something was wrong. Ben had always been the noisy one. He filled every room with sound, whether he was humming tunelessly, tapping his fingers on the table, or talking to himself as he wandered from room to room. But after a few days in the house, something changed in him. He grew quieter, more reserved, as if the silence had seeped into him too.

At first, it was subtle. I thought he was just adjusting to the move like the rest of us. But then I started catching him sitting alone in the living room, staring into the corners of the room, his lips moving soundlessly as if he was having a conversation. When I asked him what he was doing, he looked up at me, his expression distant and strange.

“It’s easier to hear them when it’s quiet,” he said softly.

“Hear who?” I asked, frowning.

Ben just shrugged, his gaze drifting back to the empty corners of the room. “You’ll see,” he said, almost too quietly to hear.

I didn’t think much of it at first, dismissing it as Ben’s overactive imagination. He had always been a bit odd, with a vivid imagination that made him prone to daydreams. But soon, things started to happen that I couldn’t ignore. One night, as I lay in bed, the silence around me seemed to grow heavier, more oppressive. It pressed down on my chest, making it hard to breathe. And then I heard it—a faint, almost imperceptible murmur, like voices carried on a breeze that wasn’t there.

I tried to tell myself it was just my imagination, but the whispers continued, too quiet to understand but unmistakably real. I sat up, my heart pounding in my chest, listening intently. The sound wasn’t coming from outside. It was inside the house—inside the walls.

I slipped out of bed and crept down the hallway to Ben’s room. His door was slightly ajar, and I peeked inside, half-expecting to find him whispering to himself in the dark. But Ben was sound asleep, his face peaceful, his lips closed. The whispers weren’t coming from him.

As I stood in the doorway, straining to hear, I realized with a cold, creeping dread that the voices were coming from the very walls of the house itself. I backed away, my skin crawling with fear, and hurried back to my room. I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

The next morning, I confronted Ben about it. I asked him if he had heard anything strange during the night. He looked at me, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his lips.

“Did you hear them too?” he asked, his eyes wide with something that looked almost like excitement.

I froze, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end. “What are you talking about, Ben? Who are you hearing?”

He just shook his head, his smile fading into something more somber. “I’m not supposed to tell you yet,” he whispered. “They don’t like it when things get too loud.”

I didn’t know what to say to that. A deep sense of unease settled over me, and from that moment on, I couldn’t look at Ben the same way. It was like something had changed in him, something I couldn’t understand, and I was terrified to find out what it was.

Over the next few days, the whispers grew louder. They followed me from room to room, always just out of reach, like a conversation I couldn’t quite catch. At times, I thought I could hear my name, whispered so softly it was almost lost in the stillness. I tried to ignore it, tried to focus on anything else, but the silence was relentless, suffocating. It wrapped around me like a second skin, making it impossible to escape the sensation that the house was watching, waiting.

Then, one night, something changed. I woke up in the middle of the night, and for the first time in days, the house was completely, utterly silent. No whispers, no creaks, nothing. The silence was so absolute that it felt unnatural, as if the house itself had stopped breathing.

I lay there, frozen, every muscle tense as I strained to hear something, anything. But there was nothing. And then I felt it—a presence, something standing just beyond my line of sight, watching me. My heart raced, but I couldn’t move, couldn’t make a sound. It was as though the silence had wrapped itself around me, holding me in place, trapping me in the stillness.

Slowly, I turned my head toward the corner of the room, and that’s when I saw it. A figure, barely visible in the shadows, standing perfectly still. It didn’t move, didn’t breathe—it just stood there, listening. I squeezed my eyes shut, willing it to disappear, but when I opened them again, it was gone. The silence, however, remained, heavy and oppressive.

The next morning, Ben was gone.

My parents were frantic. They called the police, organized search parties, and combed the woods surrounding the farmhouse, but no one found any trace of him. The authorities assumed he had run away, but I knew better. The silence had taken him.

After Ben disappeared, the whispers became constant, no longer content to stay hidden in the walls. They followed me everywhere, filling my mind with a ceaseless murmur that made it impossible to think. I tried to explain it to my parents, but they didn’t understand. They couldn’t hear the whispers.

And now, I know the silence is coming for me too. The whispers are louder now, more insistent. They speak to me, telling me things I don’t want to hear. I try to block them out, but it’s no use. The silence has wormed its way inside me, and I can’t escape it.

I know it’s only a matter of time before the silence takes me too.
