I’ve always hated my job. When I was younger, being a park ranger sounded like freedom — long hikes, fresh air, solitude. At 27, it just feels like decay. Monotony wrapped in tree bark and silence.



*I used to wish something would happen.*



My daily shifts were always the same: rounds through quiet, wooded trails in SW Virginia. I worked mornings, so I never expected much more than the occasional bear or lost tourist. The sunrise was usually the highlight — pale pink haunting, bleeding through branches like something watching.



That morning started like all the rest.

Coffee. Boots. Silence.



Except for the car.

A red honda civic, tucked alone in the back of the parking lot. Faded paint flaking off like skin. I didn’t think much of it at first. Early hikers are rare, but not impossible. Still, as the hours dragged on and hikers came and went, that car never moved. It just sat there. Watching.



Toward the end of my shift, curiosity got the better of me. I crept toward it. Its windows were coated in grime, like a layer of sweat that never dried. I cupped my hands against the glass, peering inside.



Nothing. No ID. No bag. No smell.

Just an empty driver’s seat, and a faint imprint on the passenger side — like someone had been sitting there for a long, long time.

As I walked off, I realized a dimly shadowed figure reflected off the mirror of the car. Only issue was that I was the only one there at the time.



I told the night ranger in passing. He laughed it off. “You’re a good kid, nothings gonna happen to you. It’s on the inside that counts.”

It partly stuck with me.



Disappearances like these happened before. 

I never assisted in the search though.



Two days passed. I couldn’t stop thinking about the possibilities. 

I felt like I was in a grotesque horror movie and I was the next victim. 

A wimpy 5’8 stick — easier to overlook.



The car never moved. 



By then, the idea had burrowed deep inside me like a tick. I couldn’t let it go. A red car. A missing person, maybe. A reason — finally, a reason — to feel something on this goddamn trail. Even though it shouldn’t have, it exhilarated me. I felt like I, finally, had purpose.



No hikers came that day. The previous night’s rain had scared them off. It was just me and the civic.



So I went looking.



Water bottles. Radio. Flashlight. I told myself I was doing my job, but even then I think I knew better. I wasn’t looking for someone to rescue.



Barely into the trail, I heard a noise: some type of groaning. 

Feeling tense, curiosity forced me off the trail and to the left.

Navigating through the thick and dense bunches of pine trees, I moved where the noise grew louder.



What first sounded like a mumble or groan turned into a shriek, almost making me turn back.

I wondered: 

What if it was the woman in the red civic?

I had to help her.



Thus, I sprang forward, looking for the sound with more urgency.

About two minutes later, I came face to face with what I could only think was a doe.



Its stomach was mauled, almost like a bear got to it.

There weren’t any flies yet, but the smell of guts pouring out almost made me hurl.

It looked unnatural: no human nor animal could be so precise yet malicious.



At this moment, I felt for the woman in the red civic. 

For the isolation in these woods.

For the terror of the unknown — hell, even I’m cautious around these woods.

But most of all, 

For likely being dead.



I knew I had to find her.

I knew this trail better than I knew myself. 



Now the real walking commenced. 



Around the three-mile mark, I found it — a puddle of mud where there shouldn't have been one. Thick. Murky. Unnatural. Like the ground itself had opened to swallow something. The forest felt too still. Birds had gone silent. Air too hot, too heavy, like breathing through wet cotton.



I stepped off the trail.

I told myself I was searching.



But really… I think I was following.

Something.



The trees got tighter the deeper I went, like they didn’t want me there. The underbrush clawed at my legs, and still I kept going. I was driven, but by what, I couldn’t say.



Then, suddenly, I stopped.



Nothing had changed — not the trees, not the light, not the air — but something was wrong. Like the woods had been holding their breath and finally exhaled.



Eventually I reached a clearing. Nothing special. Just a circle of dirt and dead leaves.



In the center was a backpack. Moldy. Faded. Like it had been here for years.



I dumped everything on the ground.



A cracked phone with one photo left in the gallery. 

A selfie of a woman in a red honda civic. Passenger seat. Smiling at someone just off camera. 

I checked the time stamp: 3 days ago.



Upon closer inspection, the woman’s face felt familiar, but I couldn’t place why.



Under the phone:  
  
A polaroid photo that the wind blew away from me.

One thing was left, but it was inside the bag. 

A note. Scribbled in sharpie on the inside flap:

“Don’t let him find you.”



Who was him? 

Was there someone in the forest that was dangerous… or something?



Looking around me, I realized the trees were carved with an assortment of large symbols. 

Triangles, circles, pentagrams; no one had, to my knowledge, been this deep off the trail.



That’s when I felt it behind me.



Like pressure on my lungs. Like being watched through keyholes.



I turned slowly.



A shape stood between the trees.

Tall. Too tall.

Human-shaped.

But wrong.



It didn’t look like anything I was warned about.

It was wrong.

Ungodly. 

It wasn’t walking. It was just… there.

Was it watching, preying on me?



I blinked hoping it would be gone.

It was still there, standing in that awkward position.

The trees around it moved.

Part of me felt terrified. *Only part.*



It got closer and I heard muffled whispers around. 

It wasn’t that I couldn’t make out what they were saying — I didn’t want to.

This all had to be bullshit.



I hoisted my gun and shot at that *thing* twice.

The safety was, oddly enough, already off.

The first bullet hit through the shadow into a tree; the shadow disappeared. 

The second struck something on the ground — a photo. 

I rushed to the polaroid, flipping it over; memories rushed to my mind which shook me to my core. 



*I was the man taking the woman’s photo.* 



Then it hit me.

I didn’t come here to rescue the woman.

I came to finish what I had started.



The others got away.

*The next won’t.*



She had to run off before I could finish the job, though.

She had to hide in the woods — the one place I didn’t think to check.

She had to escape my grasp before I could finally get to her.



I wanted to save her from whatever’s in these woods.



That’s what made my stomach turn. Not guilt. Not fear. Just disappointment.

The game was over. 



I returned anticipating to see only the civic in the lot.



*But it wasn’t.*



And that’s when I knew.

It wasn’t just the girl who was gone.

It was the story I told myself — that I was just curious, just bored, just doing my job.



I mean, I somehow had to entertain myself, right? 

Fuck what other fucking things could I’ve done in SW Virginia. 

I came here, not for the solace of the woods, but the isolation of them. 

It’s easier to prey in the shadows and between the branches than in an open, bustling city.



People warned me about Appalachia. 

The skinwalkers and mimics hunt people.

They drove them out and made them mad. 



*Skinwalkers are not real though.* 



Those shits are made up.

People go crazy from the desolation within the trees. 

The sunrises that are the highlight of their day.



I came here to see something so crazy it would exhilarate me. 

Instead, that lack of terror drove me mad. 



Because monsters don’t come howling in the woods.

They clock in at 5:00 AM and drink black coffee.

They stare too long into cars that don’t belong to them.

They feel nothing when someone goes missing — except a bitter taste when it’s not their hands that did the work.



And the worst part?



The game was over and I had lost. 



*I think I’ll miss the civic.*

*Its blissful red paint peeling off, similar to the skin I planned to strip from her.*



Promptly returning home, I only knew one thing: I was hungry.

Entering my pantry, I finally found the woman — I cried out, clinging to her lifeless body.

She learned to embrace me for who I was; not responding was her form of support.



Now, I’ve invited a woman with a blue Convertible over. 



Blue’s not quite my color. 

Don’t worry, I can always repaint.

Afterall, it’s on the inside that counts.
