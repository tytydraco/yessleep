just making sure I can actually post, I’m new to reddit.

Edit :
I tried deleting this but it’s still here. Is anyone else having issues with Reddit?

~~We see you~~

Wait, I didn’t write that.
I think I deleted it?


---

Edit :
Okay, weird. I’m just gonna leave this up for now. If something’s wrong with my account, I’ll deal with it later.

Also, hi. I guess. I’m not really sure where to start with all this.


---

Edit :
Looks like I can't actually post on other subs right now. Not sure what's wrong.

Either way, I guess I'm stuck here for now.

Edit :
So... maybe I’m reading too much into this.
But I swear the guy in the apartment across from me has just been standing at his window for hours. Not doing anything. Not even moving.

I tried waving. He didn’t respond.
I don’t even think he blinked.


---

Edit :
Last night there were people in my yard. Just standing there.
Four of them. No flashlights, no phones. Just silhouettes.

I tried calling the police. The line was dead.
Then I woke up.

The phone was working fine in the morning, so I think it was a dream. Except there were muddy footprints outside this morning.

Edit :
The mirror in my bathroom doesn’t show the same expression I have.
It’s like... a second behind. Sometimes longer.

I’m not joking. This isn’t a bit.
I covered the mirror with a towel. An hour later, the towel was on the floor.

I live alone.


---

Edit :
I don’t know if I’m dreaming anymore.
I’ve started leaving notes for myself. Just in case I forget.

But the handwriting keeps changing.

And some of them... I don’t remember writing.

One of them just says,

> “let them in.”

Edit :
I need to talk about something. I didn’t think it mattered.
It was a long time ago.

It was an accident.

I didn’t mean for anyone to get hurt.
But I still see her sometimes. I still hear her.

I’m so sorry.
I’m so sorry.
I’m so sorry.


---

Edit :
The lights flickered for twenty straight minutes last night.
Every time they came back on, one of the people in the yard was closer.
By the end, they were right at the glass.

Their mouths were open.
Not screaming. Just... open.


---

Edit :
There’s something in the walls.
It hums when I speak. It stops when I hold my breath.

My reflection smiled at me today.
I wasn’t smiling.


---

Edit :
I tried to leave.
I packed a bag, walked to the door.
It was gone.

The wall is smooth where it used to be.
But I can still hear the street outside.


---

Edit :

i can hear them inside the house.
they’re not walking. they’re dragging.
something is wrong with the way they move. like their bones are bending wrong.

the walls are breathing. i swear to god the walls are breathing.
i’m not alone i’m not alone i’m not alone

there’s writing on my skin. it’s not ink. it’s under. like veins.
i tried to cut it out. it spelled

> “we never left”



i’m shaking. i can’t feel my hands.
please. please if anyone is reading this;
i can’t tell what’s me anymore
i think it’s using my face
i think it’s already
i think

> they’re inside

Edit :
It’s fine. Everything is fine.
