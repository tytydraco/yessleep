I’d been out fishing with my buddy Danny loads of times. He lived out near Port Rowan and kept a boat down by the harbor for the summer months when the weather was nice and the water was fine. 

&#x200B;

Danny wasn’t exactly a man you could set your watch to, but come fishing season, so long as the weather was nice you could guarantee that he’d be out on the water in that gunmetal gray fishing boat of his. And whenever I could make it out to Port Rowan, I’d be right out there with him.

&#x200B;

I gotta be honest, half of the time we were out on that boat we were just sharing a few beers and talking idly about whatever crossed our minds. Life, kids, marriage, work. It wasn’t so much about catching fish as it was about just sort of taking a few hours to relax out on the water and forget about our troubles. 

&#x200B;

I’m of the mind that a person needs an escape like that every so often. It’s good for the soul. When life got rough, when my wife cheated on me a few years back, when Dan lost his son, whenever either of us just needed a friend to talk to for a while, those fishing trips were a Godsend. We could leave our problems at the marina and forget about them for a few hours. It was heaven.

&#x200B;

When Danny had asked me if I was free for a fishing trip that Friday, I couldn’t have said yes fast enough. I didn’t have the kids that weekend and was looking forward to spending my days on the water as opposed to bumming around the house, watching my day slip through my fingertips as I tried to stay busy. 

&#x200B;

We met up by the marina and shot the shit for a little bit as we loaded our fishing gear into the boat. Tackle, bait, cooler, and whatnot. Then with everything all good to go, I kicked back and let Danny take us out onto the open water, cracking open my first beer as he took us to one of our usual spots a short distance down along the shore. It was this nice little lagoon out near Long Point. Nothing all that special, but it was quiet and nobody else really bothered us there. 

&#x200B;

Danny stopped the boat, dropped anchor, and got himself a beer as we started to set ourselves up. He’d caught us some live grasshoppers to use as bait. We always did pretty well with those. They were a little harder to get on the hook, but the fish went crazy for them! Ten minutes after we’d made it to the lagoon, we had our lines in the water and were sitting pretty, enjoying the peaceful solitude and pleasant company. Life really couldn’t have gotten any better than that. Beers in hand, we waited for a bite and gossipped like a couple of old ladies on bingo night.

&#x200B;

  “You hear about Brad?” He’d asked me.

  “What’s going on with Brad?”

  “Stupid bastard got served his divorce papers last week.”

  “Aw hell… Don’t tell me. His wife finally figured out where his paycheque’s going?”

  “Yup. Although take a wild guess how.”

&#x200B;

I took a swig of my beer.

  “Credit card statements?” I asked hopelessly.

  “Nope. Poor girl got herself a case of brothel sprouts… From Brad.”

&#x200B;

I paused, raising an eyebrow.

  “He didn’t…”

  “He did…” Danny said, letting out a sigh that was half exasperation and half incredulity.

  “You’re shitting me?” 

  “Nope.”

  “Wow…” I just shook my head and sighed in disbelief, “That dumb fuck deserves whatever he gets at this point.”

  “Yup.”

  “I mean, she treated him so good! And he treated her like that? Y’know what I would’ve given to have married a woman like that?”

&#x200B;

  “Yup…” Danny sighed and shook his head, “I really can’t pity the bastard. I knew he was going behind her back and I told him God only knows how many times to cut that shit out. I told him, that kinda thing always catches up to you.”

  “It does,” I said, nodding slowly. 

  “He didn’t listen.”

&#x200B;

Something tugged on Danny’s line and he paused, waiting for a moment to confirm he had a bite before yanking up his line. I paused, watching him as he reeled in our first catch of the day. The fish came struggling out of the water, flipping violently back and forth as he pulled it out before dangling limply at the end of the line.

&#x200B;

  “Well, well, lookit you…” Danny said, admiring it for a few moments. It was nothing more than a simple rock bass, and a small one at that. Even if we weren’t just planning on releasing what we caught, we would’ve thrown it back anyways. We almost always threw back whatever we caught, although we’d broken that rule from time to time if we caught something worth taking home for dinner, not that we usually did. 

&#x200B;

Danny gently took the fish off the hook and set it back into the water, watching as it darted back below the murky depths. 

  “See you around, little buddy.” He’d said, before sitting back down, taking a sip of his beer, and putting some fresh bait on his line.

&#x200B;

The late morning and early afternoon drifted by in a pleasant, lazy haze as Danny and I hopped from topic to topic. The trees hanging over the lagoon gave us shade. I went through enough beers to get a little tipsy, although since Danny still had to drive the boat, he limited himself to two and he made them last. 

&#x200B;

We caught a few more fish throughout the day. Mostly more rock bass, although we’d also hooked a couple of crappies just to mix things up. 

  “You up for another beer?” I’d asked Danny, taking a fresh one out of the cooler.

  “Nah, you go right ahead.” He’d said, before slipping his phone out of his pocket to check the time. I saw him pause to respond to a text from his wife, a small smile crossing his face as he did.

&#x200B;

  “You got any dinner plans?” He asked, “Cathy’s doing chicken parmesan.”

  “Hey, count me in.” I said, “She’s a better cook than I am.”

  “Don’t I know it.” He teased, before there was another slight tug on his line. His smile had widened as he’d waited for whatever was on the other end to take a bite. He got another nibble, then another before feeling a much stronger pull and jerking his rod upwards. 

&#x200B;

  “Shit, I think this is a biggun…” He said, and judging by the fight whatever was on the other end of his line was putting up, I had a feeling he was right. We usually didn’t find anything that impressive in this little lagoon, but maybe this was the exception?

&#x200B;

Danny kept a white knuckled grip on his fishing rod, trying to reel in whatever was on the other end of it. With the way he was fighting, I almost began to wonder if what he’d actually got was a pile of stubborn weeds, but weeds didn’t usually fight like that… There was clearly something pulling at his rod. It couldn’t just be weeds, could it? Danny cranked his line up further, and the water beneath us grew cloudy with mud. I took a final sip of my beer and watched as he fought with whatever was in the water. 

  “It’s coming…” He said, “It’s coming…”

&#x200B;

I stared down over the edge of the boat, and I could’ve sworn I saw something moving down there. I thought it was just the weeds at first… But I couldn’t be entirely sure. Maybe it was a fish? But if so, I’ve never seen a fish like that before. It was easily bigger than anything else we’d ever caught!

&#x200B;

  “C’mon you bastard…” Danny growled, biting his lip as he tried to pull whatever was down there up onto the boat. Something caused the surface of the water to swell and I felt the boat rock violently beneath us. Danny paused for a moment, letting up some slack on his line, a look of utter confusion crossing his face.

  “Was that the fish?” He asked.

&#x200B;

Whatever was under the water hit the boat again, even harder this time. It rocked hard enough to knock me off my feet and I saw Danny brace himself against the railing as his fishing rod fell into the water with a splash. He stared down into the water with big wide eyes, and I saw his expression slowly go from confusion to shock as he seemed to see something beneath the surface of the water.

&#x200B;

I heard him open his mouth as he started to scream before the boat was hit again, rocking violently again and this time, it finally capsized. Danny and I were both spilled into the water as the boat flipped. I plunged beneath the surface, kicking my legs to make it back up again. As I got my head back above water, I spotted the rocky shore of the lagoon nearby and swam for it, thinking only that I needed to get the hell out of the water as soon as possible. From the corner of my eye, I saw Danny doing the same thing.

&#x200B;

He was right behind me… I swear to God he was right behind me…

&#x200B;

Then, I heard a scream. It was brief… I almost thought that maybe he was calling my name, but if he was, he never got the chance to finish. When I looked back, Danny was gone and his boat was upside down behind me. The muddy water still swirled around me, and I only hesitated for a moment before swimming frantically to shore, not even slowing down when I felt my feet touch the bottom, allowing me to trudge up into the shallows. 

&#x200B;

  “Danny?” I called, looking back again and hoping I’d see him swimming towards me. But as far as I could tell, I was alone out there.

  “DANNY?” I called again.

&#x200B;

No answer. No Danny. Just an unsettling silence, and the sight of his capsized boat about twenty feet away.

&#x200B;

The police looked, but they didn’t find any trace of Danny out in that lagoon, or anywhere in Lake Erie for that matter. They also didn’t find any trace of the thing that capsized the boat. Hell, they had the fucking gall to tell me that we’d probably just hit a rock or something. 

&#x200B;

Bullshit. 

&#x200B;

I know what happened out there. There was no rock. The boat wasn’t even moving. Danny hooked something in the water, and it knocked the boat over. I think it got him when he tried to swim away… Dragged him screaming under the water and… I don’t know… Saying ‘*it ate him*’ sounds… God, it sounds too horrible to be true, but what other explanation is there? They never found a body, and I’ve got a feeling that Danny isn’t just going to turn up alive and well somewhere… Either way, he’s gone and I don’t have any answers. I only know what I saw and truth be told it wasn’t much.

&#x200B;

If I were a bolder man, I’d say something to the effect of: ‘*I’m going back out there and I’m gonna find that thing that killed my friend!*.’ But that kind of bravado just isn’t in me. Even if I knew where or how to find it, I’ve got no idea how I’d kill it. So instead, I’m doing what I can do. I’ve been staying on land, ideally away from wherever that thing can get me, I’ve been keeping Danny’s widow company, helping her get over his loss and I’m sharing this. I’m not sure just how much good it’ll do… But if it helps someone, then maybe I’ll sleep just a little bit [easier.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)
