I’ve never been religious. I never had any problems with them, mind, but I just never grew up that way. Sure the rest of my family was some form of protestant or another, but my mom and dad never subscribed to that sort of thing, and no one ever forced it on me either. I wasn’t even one of the many minorities particularly scrutinized by bible-thumpers, so I always got on fine with my extended family too.

I guess I should also say that I’m not very spiritual or agnostic either. The thought of ghosts and goblins never interested me. And listen, I know that’s typical or cliche, but it’s just how I looked at things. A lot of people think it’s bleak, but I was fine never having to think about heaven or hell and just doing my own thing for my own sake. Kindness, to me, was never a ticket to a reward.

It wasn’t until I moved into my house in Bowling Green, Ohio that I started having problems.

It wasn’t a particularly old house, in terms of the building itself anyway. It used to be an old Victorian that had burned down some time in the 70’s, but the basement stayed entirely intact, even after 100 years and a house fire. A new house was built over top of it after another 20 years when the landlord sold the lot to a private housing LLC. And after the proceeding two years of sitting empty, I moved in. 

It was so cheap that I instantly jumped on the opportunity, and I didn’t even have to do a walk of the property, which I preferred for brevity’s sake. I had just gotten a job in Bowling Green, and moving in as fast as possible was the goal. It was the summer of 2004, so moving in was hell just for the humidity alone, but I felt like I couldn’t fumble this bag, so I went for it. I didn’t have a lot of friends, so hauling the furniture by myself for the first day of that weekend in July was more than a little uncomfortable.

It was just as I was taking a break that I decided to have a beer and check out where the best place to put extra boxes was. I really didn’t plan on unpacking everything that first day so I figured the basement was as good a place as any to store things before I looked through them, and I didn’t want to clutter the living room.

The first thing that I noticed was that it was cold down there. So cold that it was almost frigid. I know… it wasn’t smart, especially in a horror movie sense, but I decided I’d sleep down there the first couple nights because I naturally run hot and I cannot stand having to sleep in the heat. But I wouldn’t have made that decision if it weren’t for the lack of an AC unit in the upstairs bedroom. And it was absolutely perfect that night. So good that I felt like I had never slept so well in my life.

Anyway, the following day I messaged a friend of mine who I knew from childhood, who we’ll call Mike, to see if he could come help me move the rest of my stuff since he only lived a town over. His family had always been devout methodist, so he told me he’d be over after church to give me a hand. If… if I had known then, what I know now, I wouldn’t have asked. Really, I wouldn’t. Even after the… well I’ll get to it.

The day had gone fine, and after we moved the rest of the boxes down to the basement I suggested we should stay down there for a bit in the cold and have a beer. He firmly agreed and I went up to grab us some out of the fridge. It was just as I opened it and grabbed the cans that he yelled up in a bit of a confused voice.

“Hey man, uh, is there anyone else here?” He said loudly from the basement, almost surprised.

“Uhh no, not that I know of.” I yelled back, “Why?” but I was left unanswered. A few moments passed as I had just closed the fridge, still waiting for a reply. I started to walk back to the basement door, shouting again, asking if Mike was alright, but again he didn’t answer. I had a weird feeling in my gut, halfway between fear and concern. At the time it felt irrational, something had probably just spooked him downstairs. I mean, it was pretty dark down there past the very dim light the only hanging bulb could produce.

When I walked down the creaky wooden steps, though, I didn’t see him. Lacking any strong belief in the paranormal meant I had never been that afraid of the dark… but, some strange and stark terror overtook me at that moment. I searched, calmly at first, quietly calling his name, but it yielded nothing. Too afraid to search the dark corners, I went up and grabbed a flashlight so I could see better.

When I turned it on, illuminating the oppressive shadows and seeing nothing but cold, hard stonework, my mild concern turned to panic. I frantically searched the place, calling his name louder and louder. The possibility that he was pulling a prank never even entered my mind as I ran upstairs to see if his car was still in the driveway. It was, which made me even more worried. Didn’t make sense for me to look anyway, there wasn’t even a way outside from the basement.

Regardless, after shouting a few “alright, you got me!”’s I turned my attention to the woods around my house, looking until it turned dark. My bewilderment turned to fatigue, and that gave way to how tired I had felt after the activities of the day. For whatever reason, I laid down on the couch after I came back in. That fear I had just felt seemed to somehow overwhelm my brain and I just… slept. I know, my friend had just gone missing, and I fell asleep. Doesn’t look good for me, but I need to tell it as it happened.

I woke up in a panic, feeling like it had just been a moment before that I had closed my eyes. But it was fully daylight outside when I threw myself off the couch and looked at the clock.

Noon.

I was so tired still, but my mind was racing. Was someone missing him? I checked my voicemails. Nothing. No one had come to look for him either. His car sat in my driveway as it had before, empty. I thought surely that if the police came I’d somehow be suspected of foul play. But nothing. And no one followed up. Besides, it hadn’t even been the first 48 yet and there were no signs of a crime. I called in sick to work, if for nothing other than my nerves.

The daylight seemed to pass without a moment’s thought, and I sat in the dark again. The coffee I had made turned cold, but I still worried that someone might come looking, and I wouldn’t have an answer as to his whereabouts. I quickly tried to rationalize in my head that it was his prerogative to run away if he wished, and that this was probably premeditated and had nothing to do with me… That thought held firm for a time, but deep down that fear still had sway.

His car was still in my driveway.

Another night passed on the couch, and the next morning as I was getting ready for work I told myself I’d try to call his family, or maybe his girlfriend to see if they had seen him. After all, I had known her from highschool and the three of us were always good friends, so maybe we could work together to figure it out. It just didn’t feel right to ignore the situation, as much as my mind didn’t want to think about it.

In hindsight it probably wasn’t the best idea, as the only evidence of his last location was my house. But I had no idea what else to do, and I was still too scared to call the police. I figured I’d just explain the situation to the best of my ability and hope she had some sympathy for it, even if she had to work through her own feelings about it.

The day went by sluggishly, and I didn’t get much work done. It was only as I was sitting at my desk that it actually entered my mind that this whole thing might’ve been some kind of elaborate joke. And now it was affecting my work, which made me a little bit angry, to be honest. I decided then to call Mike’s girlfriend and clear it all up. If anyone else was in on it, it would be her.

The phone rang for an uncomfortable amount of time, and I tapped my finger on my keyboard in anticipation. When the call finally went through I heard Stacy’s usual cheery voice on the other side.

“Hello, this is Stacy, what’s up?” She said, without even the slightest hint of concern in her voice.

“Uh, hey Stace, it’s me Brett. Hey um… I know this might sound kind of weird, but have you seen Mike?” My voice shook, starting with pity and turning to irritation.

“Oh hey! I haven’t seen you for a while! And who’s Mike?” That question genuinely made me angry as I had had enough of the game they were playing, which I was then sure must be happening.

“Okay, haha, very funny, but I’m serious. This isn’t fun anymore and I’m kinda starting to get pissed. Just please tell him to come get his car.” I can’t say I didn’t feel some kind of relief at this. I mean, it was a cruel prank, but I was glad they were just messing with me and nothing had actually happened to Mike. I had just jumped to conclusions far too fast.

“Listen, Brett, I don’t know who Mike is and I don’t really appreciate being yelled at. What’s wrong??” Her voice came sharply, tinged with her own annoyance at my insistence.

“You know, Mike, your boyfriend of five years??” My own voice dropped a bit at the end of the question. No idea why though, I still had the idea that this was some kind of joke.

“Brett, you know my last boyfriend was Andrew, I don’t know what you’re talking about. Please tell me what’s wrong. And if this is a joke I don’t like it.” She seemed genuine. I honestly didn’t know what to make of it. Even if it was a joke it was thorough, at least. My next action was ill-advised, considering.

“Okay. Alright, I’m sorry… I guess it’s just stress from the new job and new house… would you want to come over and check it out?” I was still convinced she was in on it, so maybe seeing his car would make the whole thing stop. You know, he’d pop out of the bushes and we’d all have a good laugh.

“Okay sure, Brett, that sounds good. I’ll bring a house-warming gift.” Which sounded to me like it would be a confession. So I played along and said that would be great. 

After I got home I parked my shitty little Corolla next to Mike’s car and waited. I didn’t want to move, I just wanted to wait for this to be over. Stacy pulled in not long after, and when she got out of her car I opened my door violently and gestured toward Mike’s car with both my hands, expecting her to relent and give it up.

To my dismay, though, she just stood there looking confused with a bottle of moscato in her hand.

“Well?? Ring any bells? Come out Mike! I give!” I yelled, looking more than halfway crazy at this point.

Stacy just looked at me with wide eyes, and then… laughed. She laughed to herself. I was dumbfounded, so I asked her what she was laughing at.

“Okay, Brett, I get it. You just pulled this whole stunt to get me to come over, right? Well it’s good, I liked your execution.” And then it was my turn to stare with wide eyes.

“So you’ve never seen this car in your life, or know the person who drives it?” I asked a bit incredulously.

“No, of course not Brett. Very good lead up, but I’m here now. So let’s just drink this bottle of wine and watch a movie or something.” At this point I had no idea how to react. So I just followed her inside.

We did end up drinking the bottle of wine, and watching a movie, but the whole time I just looked at her out of the side of my eye, still somehow waiting for her to suddenly say “gotcha!” But it never came, and the night ended with her laying her head on my shoulder. 

I… wish, that I could say that’s where it stopped. And listen, I know what happens next makes me a scumbag, I know that. But I had always had feelings for Stacy, even back in highschool, and I can’t say I wasn’t more than a little bit jealous of Mike for scoring her. Regardless… I asked her if she’d want to stay over, since we were a little bit too inebriated. She agreed so I went to get her a blanket.

When I returned to the living room she was stood up, walking toward the stairs. I knew instantly where she was going, and followed her up to my room, making sure to close and lock the basement door before heading up. If it weren’t for the booze I would’ve laid down on the couch and let her have my bed. But…

We… had sex. Yes, I know. I just couldn’t help myself. I was tired and weak and really wanted to distract my mind, even for a little bit. It was all I could do to stop from crying after it was over. Not only did I feel like I had lost my friend, but also that I had just betrayed him.

I must’ve dozed off though, because the next thing I remember was waking up to Stacy getting out of bed. She said she just wanted to get a glass of water and that she’d be right back. I nodded sleepily and put my hand where she had been on the bed. I felt something cold and noticed that her gold cross necklace had fallen off at some point, and I held it for a minute, rubbing the hard edges, and I closed my eyes again.

I awoke once more to a bed that was still empty, save for myself. I felt that old fear rise up in me again, but I stifled it, trying to reason that she might’ve just gone to the bathroom. But I lay in the same position, and the bed beside me had since been undisturbed. 

“Stacy?!” I called out to the darkness. I don’t know what I expected, but after Mike’s disappearance I was so on edge that I choked, yelping as I finished the word.

No response.

I could feel the abject horror start to etch itself onto my face, but like I said I tried to stifle it. I rose up out of the safety of my sheets and walked slowly to the bedroom door. It was so dark in the hall that I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. Even the light of the street lamp outside seemed to hesitate before entering between the blinds.

Every single creak of the floorboards rang out in the pitch. As I slowly reached the bottom of the staircase I could see a dull glow coming from beyond the foyer. It was coming from the basement, leaking out like ichor from the crack in the door. It wasn’t… normal. The light was tinged with pale red, that seemed a little too organic for me.

I moved, ever so slowly towards the door as that sickly illumination hit my face and I felt my skin crawl, but it was just as my hand reached the handle that the light turned off, vanishing and leaving me in pure darkness. I didn’t think it could happen, but I was even more terrified than before, clutching my chest and trying to will my breathing to calm down.

I grabbed my flashlight and opened the door, switching on the light and shining it to the bottom of the stairs. Again, it was cold stonework that met my eyes, and I walked down to investigate. There was nothing, and no one was in my basement. 

I sat down on the couch in my living room again and stayed there, facing forward, until sunlight started to pour through my windows. I just… didn’t know what to do. I didn’t call anyone. Though, if I had, I’m sure no one would’ve known who Stacy was or why I was calling them. And I was right about that, as when I called her mother later she insisted that she never had a daughter named Stacy.

I put the house up for sale soon after… but no one looked. I didn’t care what I was losing, I just left and never looked back. Afterall, I didn’t need the things I left there, they were less important than the memory of my friends. I just wish I hadn’t learned that the hard way.
