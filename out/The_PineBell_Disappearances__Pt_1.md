My grandfather recently passed away. God rest his soul.

He was a stern man—firm in word and principle—but there was a gentleness to him, the kind that surfaced during quiet mornings by the lake or late-night chats in front of the TV. He used to be the sheriff of a small Arkansas town called PineBell. He held that badge for years before moving our family up north, away from the humid woods and red dirt roads.

When he passed, his will was read aloud. Property, money, cars—all divided neatly among the family. Then they handed me a box. No pomp. No explanation. Just a plain box and a look that said, “This one’s for you.”

I wasn’t about to complain. Grandpa always told me, “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.” So I took it home, set it on my table, and opened it. Inside were a few keepsakes: framed photographs, that old VHS player and his tapes, a handful of medals from Vietnam, a lighter engraved with his name and age, and a rugged Bowie knife—used, sharpened, and deadly beautiful.

And then… there was a book.

Not a thick tome, but a weighty leather-bound journal. No markings on the front or spine. I flipped it over. Nothing on the back either. I opened it to the first page. Scrawled in pen:

“Property of Robert Donaldson.”

I spent the next several hours reading that journal, page after page. At first, I thought maybe it was a draft for some novel he never published. But the deeper I read, the less sure I became. This wasn’t fiction—not the kind you can walk away from, anyway. Something about it felt… wrong. Too real.

So now, I’m transcribing it. I don’t know why, but I feel like people need to know.

⸻

This is what was written inside:

The night of January 3rd, 1981, Jenny Harvey disappeared from her parents’ home.

We got the call early the next morning. I headed over right away. Her parents were frantic—sobbing and yelling. Their 17-year-old daughter was just gone. In PineBell, folks going missing wasn’t unheard of—drunks wandering off, someone skipping out on a debt—but a teenage girl vanishing in the middle of the night? That was new.

Her bedroom window was wide open. No forced entry. Nothing stolen. Her jewelry, makeup—all untouched. But some clothes and toiletries were missing. Her car hadn’t moved an inch. She’d left on foot. In the dead of winter.

We launched a citywide search. At first, I figured she’d snuck off to a boyfriend’s house. But when we questioned him, he said he hadn’t seen her—hadn’t even spoken to her since he got grounded the week before. Her friends hadn’t heard from her in days.

Two weeks passed. Nothing. No sightings. No leads.

We scoured the town, the woods, the roads in and out—even searched the sewers and drainage areas. Volunteers helped. Her folks never gave up. But we came up with nothing.

Then, on January 13th, two more girls vanished: Faith Woods and Katherine Hill.

Same pattern. Left behind their valuables. Took only the essentials. Disappeared in the middle of the night. No noise. No witnesses. No struggle.

We questioned everyone—neighbors, boyfriends, teachers, friends. All had alibis. All clueless. We ran background checks, retraced steps, followed hunches into dead ends. Nothing stuck. It was like the girls had just… vanished.

Their missing posters and photos went up all over town—lampposts, shop windows, diner counters. They stared back at us from those posters, and every time you looked, it was like a weight settled on your chest. Watching their parents break down and lose hope one tear at a time was worse than anything else.

Without their daughters, the life just left them. When you’d see them, they had a glaze over their eyes, like their spirit had left. I’d drive by to see how they were holding up.

I’d walk up to knock on the door, and before I did, I could hear their mothers crying from another room.

When I got home some nights, I’d sit in my kitchen, pour myself a glass of whiskey, and down it—let it burn.

Seeing the families of PineBell grieve their lost children brought me back to Vietnam, and what happened there.

February passed. We kept looking—me, my deputies, and whatever civilians hadn’t given up yet. But the searches turned quiet. And eventually, they turned into candlelight vigils.

And then came March 3rd. Tegan Dean disappeared. Same story.

Deputy Moore and I arrived at the Dean residence. Her mother was a wreck, sobbing like she was already at the funeral. She had to leave the room to save herself the embarrassment of us seeing her ruin her makeup.

Her father sat stiffly in an armchair, staring at one corner of the room. We got everything out of him that we could, and when we got up, we followed his gaze—a family portrait on the mantel.

Later that week, the fathers of all four missing girls cornered me at the station. Anger, heartbreak, and desperation in their eyes. They accused me of giving up—of not doing enough.

“Y’all haven’t even named a suspect!” barked Mr. Dean.

They weren’t wrong. But without any leads or evidence of foul play, we had nothing. Every person we’d interviewed had solid alibis. No witnesses. No signs of a break-in. No notes. No cries for help.

“Our girls didn’t just leave!” shouted Mr. Harvey. “Someone took them, God-damn it!”

They kept bickering at me, but… one name kept getting brought up.

Anderson Bell.

The golden boy of the Bell family, heirs to the fortune built off the old diamond mine that made PineBell what it was. Anderson had a reputation: rich, spoiled, dangerous. He’d get drunk and smash up property, shoplift for kicks, and more than once we caught him with underage girls in his car. But his daddy’s money always got him off the hook.

Still, he hadn’t been seen for weeks—right around the time the disappearances began.

When he finally showed his face in town again, I brought him down to the station.

He reeked of whiskey. I almost cuffed him just for showing up drunk, but I sat him down anyway.

“You sober enough to understand what’s going on, Anderson?” I asked.

He rubbed the bridge of his nose and replied with a crooked smile, “Ain’t drunk, Sheriff. Just a little hungover. Big difference.”

I wasn’t in the mood. “Don’t be a smart-ass. Four girls are missing—Jenny Harvey, Faith Woods, Katherine Hill, and Tegan Dean. You know anything about them?”

He blinked slowly. I could see the shadows under his eyes—he’d probably been on a bender all night.

“I wasn’t even here, Sheriff. I was in Memphis. Ask my father.”

“I did,” I said, leaning forward. “He said you were ‘taking time.’ Didn’t sound like business. Sounded like rehab. Again.”

Anderson met my eyes. “That ain’t your concern.”

“It is,” I said, “when four girls go missing while you’re gone—no struggle, no note, just gone. Girls don’t vanish quiet like that unless someone convinces them to.”

He tilted his head. “So what am I, the boogeyman? Snatching up teenagers in the night?”

“I ain’t saying that. But you lie easy, you drink hard, and you’ve got a charm that curdles into something real dark when no one’s lookin’.”

Anderson’s eyes narrowed. It wasn’t often someone talked down to him.

“So what, Sheriff? You think I planned all this? Drove back into town, crept up to their windows, and carried them off one by one?”

I stepped in close. “Maybe you didn’t drive. Maybe someone else did. Maybe you never left at all.”

He grinned, but his eyes were cold. “You’ve got no idea who you’re pokin’ at, Sheriff.”

“Oh, I do,” I said. “And I don’t care how many zeroes your daddy writes on his checks. You’re not walking out of here untouched this time.”

But I was wrong.

He walked. We didn’t have a damn thing on him.

Still, even as he left that station, I knew something deep in my bones: those girls didn’t just leave. Someone led them out. Or chased them into the dark.

⸻

On April 1st, the final girls went missing—Luanne Whitaker and Darlene McGraw.

The town and I ached with sorrow and grief. Same as the last four—every detail the same. But this time, something was different.

When we searched through Darlene’s bedroom, we found something. In her closet, tucked beneath a heap of old shoes, was a half-torn scrap of paper—wet, dirt-stained, and nearly rotted through.

On the back of the paper were the words: “Bell Hollow.”

That’s when it clicked. Bell Hollow was the name of the most successful mine the Bells owned back in the day.

That name—Bell Hollow—kept circling my thoughts like buzzards over a dying animal.

I remembered the mine, of course. I was a boy when it collapsed back in ‘58. Thirty-three dead. Closed overnight. Whole shaft sealed in. The papers said it was a cave-in. Dad always said it was “a mercy.” Never explained that part.

I decided to go to the PineBell County Records Office. I needed to do some digging.

I went in, and after looking around the Bell Mining Co. documents and reports, I found something.

In the wrongful death report, there was a footnote about the mine—how it “collapsed from the inside” due to “unauthorized digging” in a new shaft.

Along with all that, I also found a sealed envelope. The Bell Mining Co. was stamped on it. When I opened it, it read:

“INTERNAL — DO NOT FILE”

Inside: references to “Hollow Shaft #3,” marked as “CLOSED BY ORDER OF CHARLES BELL”—Anderson’s grandfather.

This was all new. This stuff must’ve been shoved here in hopes no one would ever find it.

But I did.

I stood in the judge’s chambers, my hat tucked under my arm. I walked up and placed a weathered piece of notebook paper on the judge’s desk.

“Six girls, Your Honor. All gone without a trace. And this mine—Bell Hollow—we found a note in Darlene McGraw’s room with the name on it. Now I ain’t gonna go diggin’ around, I just wanna look down there.”

Judge Pine leaned back in his leather chair, the wood groaning beneath his weight. He tapped a gold pen—with some sort of star engraved on it—against his chin, not looking at me.

“I sympathize, truly. But I don’t see how this ties Bell Hollow to anything. Could be a prank. Kids write all sorts of nonsense.”

I clenched my jaw slightly and said, “With respect, Your Honor, but you think a 14-year-old writes a prank note before going missing? Bell Hollow’s the only thing that connects to Darlene McGraw—maybe to all six of ‘em.”

Judge Pine’s eyes darted toward the window behind me. He shifted in his chair.

“Sheriff, that mine’s been closed for over forty years. There’s nothing out there but sinkholes and liability lawsuits. You want to start tearing it up, you’ll need more than a scribbled note with one word on it.”

“Just a warrant to search it. A team and some flashlights.”

Judge Pine turned in his chair. He looked at me and the paper. Then he stood and said, “Request denied.”

“On what grounds?” I asked, raising my voice.

“On the grounds that I won’t allow this town to be dragged into another circus over anecdotal evidence.” He was already walking toward the door, clearly ending the meeting.

“Or is there somethin’ in that mine you don’t want found?” I said, following him with my eyes as he walked out.

Pine turned halfway back. His expression hadn’t changed. Then he turned fully and walked out, not saying a word. He just closed the door behind him.

After that, I made up my mind. Later that night, I dialed Deputy Drew Moore.

Drew was my best deputy—one of the few who was there when you needed him.

Didn’t even check the time. Picked up on the second ring, like he’d been waiting for it.

“Sheriff?”

“Drew. I need you.”

“…Everything alright?”

“No. Meet me in fifteen. Bring a sidearm, and pack a flashlight. We’re going down into Bell Hollow.”

There was silence. Then:

“You found something?”

“I did.”

“Something about the girls?”

“…Maybe. And maybe something worse.”

“Ok, I’m on my way,” he said, and hung up the phone.

I went to my closet and grabbed my 870 and a Maglite. Taped them together.

Sat on the bed with my shotgun. My wife was laying there next to me, sleeping. I said a quick prayer—and slipped out the door quiet as I could.

When I arrived a mile down the road from the Bell quarry, Drew was already there, waiting. We both got out of our personal cars.

We walked up and looked at each other. We didn’t say a word. We just headed for the gate, kept the flashlights off, and walked through the woods adjacent to the quarry entrance.

The quarry had been abandoned and the equipment left to rust, but the Bells kept security high.

Barbed wire fences. And a guardsman.

“I thought this place was abandoned?” Drew said.

“Listen—we’re gonna have to do something. Just follow me.”

The entrance angled in, and to the left of the gate was a guard station with a small lamp inside.

No lights around it besides that one. We crossed the road and slowly made our way along the wooded fence line.

When we got close, Drew tripped over a fallen tree branch and landed hard, crashing into a bush and snapping some branches.

The guard looked up from his book. I hit the dirt. “Stay there, Drew. Don’t move. He’s heard us,” I whispered, keeping my hand stretched out to make sure he stayed down.

The guard pulled a flashlight from his belt and flicked it on, keeping the beam low as he stepped toward the tree line that bordered the dirt road.

He was getting closer. I crawled low to the left, arcing behind a tree.

“Hello? Anyone out there?” he called out, sweeping his light through the brush.

I could see Drew—still and flat. The guard came closer, beam sweeping, then—

His light caught Drew. “Hey! What are y—”

I stepped out from behind the tree and cracked him across the temple with the butt of my shotgun.

He went down hard, dropped his light, clutching his head. We jumped on him. One more tap from my stock and he was out cold.

We cuffed him and dragged him behind the bushes.

“We’ll get him later. Let’s keep moving.”

We took his keys and made our way to the guard station.

From there we looked down at the dirt road leading into the quarry.

Fresh tire marks. A lot of them. People had been here recently.

We unlocked the gate and walked into the open gravel yard.

Diggers and trucks lined up like a truck cemetery. We walked between them and I stopped, kneeling by one.

I pulled a map of the quarry from my back pocket. Drew pulled out a flashlight covered in red tape.

We checked our position. Bell Quarry was huge, and the mine was way in the back of the property.

Drew flicked off his light. We continued.

“Sheriff, can I ask you something?” he said.

I slowed my pace. “Now’s a hell of a time, Drew.”

“I just… you think we’re chasing ghosts? Or worse, stirring something up? Why won’t the judge let us near this place? You ever wonder if he’s… involved somehow?”

“Doesn’t matter. Six girls are gone. Something stirred first. I wonder about a lotta folks lately.”

Drew didn’t answer. Just kept walking beside me, boots crunching gravel softer now.

We rounded a bend in the path—and there it was. Half-swallowed by the hillside. Overgrown with vines and rusted fencing that looked more ceremonial than secure. The entrance to Bell Hollow.

Drew stopped short. So did I.

The hair on my neck stood up. A bead of sweat pooled on my brow. I wiped it away.

“Sheriff, look!” Drew whispered, grabbing my shoulder.

I looked to the right.

Cars. Parked neatly against the cliffside. A dozen at least. Shiny black sedans, polished trucks, foreign SUVs with county plates. Not a single rust spot among them.

Not the kind of cars you’d expect out here. Not at this hour. And not from folks who usually pretend the quarry doesn’t exist.

“…Ain’t that the mayor’s Range Rover?”

“And that’s the president of the school board’s truck,” I muttered. “And the Bell boy’s Charger.”

A chill crawled up my spine. We were seeing something we weren’t supposed to.

We ducked low, moving from boulder to boulder, keeping to the shadows cast by the moonlight and the dead trees that lined the ridge.

We ran from cover. Drew pressed his back to one side of the mine’s entrance. I took the other.

He pulled his revolver and flashlight. I readied my shotgun. We looked down.

Footprints.

Ten, maybe twenty, leading from the vehicles into the mine.

We flicked on our lights and aimed them down the narrow passage.

It opened suddenly into a sheer drop. Nothing but an old iron ladder bolted into the stone, leading down into darkness so thick the flashlight beams seemed to die halfway.

“Jesus,” Drew whispered. “How far does it go?”

My light followed the rusted rungs and damp stone—thirty feet, maybe more. After that, it vanished into black.

The air changed again. Colder. Still. I heard the slow drip of water echoing from below.

Drew stepped back. “Something’s wrong with the air down there.”

I reached out and touched the ladder. It groaned under my hand—like it remembered being touched before, and didn’t like it.

“We go slow,” I said. “One at a time. Keep your light steady.”

“We shouldn’t be here,” Drew said, voice shaking.

“No,” I said, tightening my grip on the ladder. “But they are.”

Then I began the descent—rung by rung—into the hollow throat of the earth.

When I reached the final rung, I dropped into the dirt. My boots sank slightly.

I unslung my shotgun and flicked on my light. “Come on down, Drew,” I whispered.

Drew started down. I panned my light along the walls—old support beams, the warped track on the floor.

The air was wrong. It smelled different.

Sweet, like dried roses left to rot. But underneath it… something bitter. Metallic. Like burnt copper and old blood boiled into smoke.

Drew landed next to me and gave me a start. After letting my heart slow, he flicked on his light.

We moved forward slowly along the rail, past creaking beams.

Dust fell from the ceiling onto my shoulder. I wiped it off and patted my leg.

We walked for a while. Turned a corner.

And there it was—the old shaft.

The collapse was worse than I’d imagined. Rock and timber tangled like broken ribs, snapped inward like the mine had tried to swallow itself.

Drew swept his light over the rubble. “Is this it?”

“Yeah,” I said. The smell was stronger here. That same incense—only heavier. Soaked into the stone. It clung to the back of my throat like mold and ash.

Drew paced near the edge of the collapsed shaft, light low. His boot hit something hollow.

I stepped over, crouching beside him. Beneath a layer of dirt and stone was a metal door—three feet wide, six feet long.

I leaned down, shone my light through a barred grate. It led further down—a stone staircase.

I placed a hand on the metal. It was warm.

I pulled the door open and propped it against the wall.

At the bottom of the stairs was a glow—flickering from deep below.

We moved downward, flashlights sweeping across worn stone steps.

Each one had a dip in the center. Hundreds of feet had passed this way. That incense choked the air now—burned my eyes.

At the landing was a long stone hallway. Our footsteps echoed, too loud.

The walls were marked—not scratched, but carved. Symbols etched deep into the stone. Some worn, some fresh.

Circles. Arrows. Angular lines intersecting and spiraling. Strange geometry.

Along the wall were recesses—each held a golden candleholder. Antique, ornate. Burgundy-red candles burned low.

Each holder had a symbol carved into it: two interlocked triangles forming a star. And in the center… almost like a trident crossed with a noose.

It felt ritualistic. But not like anything from a church I’d ever seen.

That’s when we heard it.

From the end of the hall—chanting. And bells.

We moved fast.

At the end stood a thick wooden door with ornate iron hinges.

Etched into a metal plate was that same star and trident symbol. There was a handle.

And a keyhole.

I leaned down and placed my eye to it—

Through the keyhole, I saw a room that opened like a cathedral buried in the bowels of the earth.
Vaulted ceilings carved from jagged stone arched overhead, blackened with soot and veined with roots that pulsed faintly—like veins.
Flickering red candles—like before—lined the room in similar cutouts in the stone.

Then I saw shadows. Not walking. Not pacing. Swaying.
Dozens of them, maybe more. Hooded figures, all lined from left to right along the aisle I was looking down.
All of them in red robes, marked with strange symbols.

At the front of the room stood a black stone altar—smoothed, polished.
Laying over it was a red cloth with ornate designs and multiple unfamiliar symbols.
Behind the altar, etched into the stone wall, was the same symbol from the door: a six-pointed star and trident.
Mounted in the center of it was a mangled skull.

It looked like a mixture of a horse, goat, and hog—
A long snout with horse teeth, sharp tusks jutting out, and horns that curved into wicked points.

The people were chanting as they swayed.
The room was smoky with that same incense we’d smelled earlier.

They suddenly stopped.

From a back room, a door creaked open—
And a man in a black robe stepped in, the trident-star symbol printed on both the front and back of his garment.
He walked slowly behind the black altar, carrying a large leather book.
He placed the book in a holder and opened it.

He raised both arms to the sky, and all the people before him kneeled.
They chanted something, and he chanted back—but his voice was deeper than theirs.

Ungodly deep.

He raised his arms higher and began chanting alone.
The ones in red raised their arms as well—and held them there.

The black priest lowered his hands and hovered them above the altar, speaking in that devil language.

Then a girl walked in.

She wore a red ritualistic gown, the center cut out, exposing her stomach.
She bowed before the altar, then climbed up onto it and laid herself down—stomach facing the black priest.

He placed his hands on her stomach and began chanting in that deep, unnatural voice.
Then he reached into his sleeve.

The priest pulled from the wide black fabric a long, gleaming needle.
It looked old—made of glass and metal.
The needle was full of a thick black substance.

He held it in the air.
The candlelight flickered off the needle and glared.

He raised it.
The congregation let out a low moan.
The priest brought the needle smoothly down onto the girl’s womb.

The point met flesh with a sickening resistance—
A wet pop as the tip pierced through the skin of her lower abdomen.

There was a moment of tension.
Then he slowly pressed the needle deeper—
It sounded like softened leather tearing, soaked in blood.

The air filled with a grotesque squelch as the needle passed into her womb.
A faint, high-pitched whistle escaped her lips.

The plunger moved with slow resistance—thick and deliberate—
Forcing a small amount of black fluid into her.

There was a moment of silence, broken only by her shallow, rapid breaths,
And the tiny, twitching spasms of her body.

And beneath it all, the worst sound of all—
The faint, wet tick-tick-tick of blood dripping from the base of the needle onto the cold stone altar below.

The priest pulled the needle out and wiped the blood off with his sleeve.
She rose from the altar and stepped down onto the floor.

As she knelt before the congregation in a prayer-line position,
Her stomach… was swelling. Moving.

One by one, they came.
Each girl, draped in the same red ritual gown, barefoot and silent, emerged from the dark archway at the back of the chamber.

Each climbed the black altar without a word.
Each lay back, arms flat, stomach bared.

The priest’s hands never trembled as he drew forth that long needle again.

The second girl whimpered as it entered her body—
Seizing once.
A single, sharp yelp before she bit through her lip.
Blood ran down her chin in a thin string.
She smiled.

The rest of the girls came forward and did the same.
All six now knelt before the black priest—
Their bellies swollen, rippling softly beneath the skin,
Like something alive had begun to take root.

That’s when I kicked in the damn door.

The old hinges gave way, and the door fell to the floor with a loud bang.
We drew our guns.

“FREEZE! YOU’RE ALL UNDER ARREST!”

I held my shotgun up. My deputy drew his revolver.
I stepped forward and looked at the girls…

Jesus Christ. Their bellies were moving.
Swelling like they were nine months in already.
Something inside was shifting—crawling.

The crowd turned to face us—twenty, maybe thirty of them—
And the priest stared, silhouetted in the smoke.

They looked like hollow blackness.
Two pinpricks of unnatural light in each face, burning like coals.

Not red. Not white.
Something else entirely—
Pale and wrong, like the reflection you catch in the woods when you shine a light at something you can’t identify.

They locked onto us.
But not with hate.
With recognition.

They saw us.
And they knew us.

They started speaking—
Voices of men, women, children.
Some crying. Some praying. Some laughing.

That’s when the girls—all six of them—arched their backs,
And the sound that ripped from their throats wasn’t a scream.

But from below…
There was something loud.
And thrashing
