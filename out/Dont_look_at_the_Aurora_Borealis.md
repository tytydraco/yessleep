The aurora borealis has been waving over these Kansan skies the past few nights. It’s absolutely breathtaking and something I never thought I’d get the chance to behold. I didn’t think it’d be one of the last things I saw, though. 

I don’t recommend you look, if it’s over you.

See, an hour ago, I was watching some horror drama series, smoking a joint, happy as can be. My black lab, Shadow, started pawing at the basement door, which is my signal that he needs to relieve himself. My joint was done anyway, so I put it out, paused my stream and tossed my phone to the couch. 

I’ve heard about the Northern Lights making their way to our skies. Seen pictures from my friends, but hadn’t gotten the chance to see it with my own eyes.  When I walk out onto my back patio, it's nearly pitch black. Nothing new, considering all my neighbors aside from the one directly next door have kids and go to bed rather early. Everyone’s got home-made privacy fences via some trees and very overgrown weeds, which lends a hand in blocking any light.

Shadow darted off into some corner of the yard as he always does. The air was chilly, so I’d pulled my sweater just a little closer around me, and that’s when I saw it. The pink lights dancing in the distance. They weren’t directly over my head, but if I stood in one particular spot, I could see it.

At first, I almost cried. It was beautiful. It waved and danced and made me grateful for being alive, being on this planet, and getting to experience things like that. I stared at the sky for what felt like forever, until the grass rustling and a bark grabbed my attention. I shouted my dog’s name as I walked back towards the back door to my home, ready to slide it open.

I hear Shadow’s footsteps start barreling towards me. I slid the door open for him, but tried to peer through the leaves of our Redbud tree for one final glimpse of the rare phenomena before heading inside. Shadow’s collar jingled just as he ran past me into the house. Even though I’d heard his footsteps, he seemed to almost appear out of nowhere from the shadows and into that moment of light. He was running so fast, he was a blur of black as he darted past me inside and up the stairs. I felt my heart skip a bit, but chalked it up to anxiety from smoking.

I locked the door and closed the blinds before heading back to continue couch-rotting, but stopped in my tracks when I got to the top of the stairs. Shadow was standing in the middle of my living room staring at me. I laughed at myself and told him to stop being creepy. Figuring we could both go for a little treat, I walked past him and into the kitchen. An ice cream pop for myself, and a pig ear for Shadow. 

Normally the crinkle of the bag is enough to make him come running. I’d all but put it back and he still hadn’t come to claim his prize. I call his name again, then peer out into the living room. The ice cream in my hand falls to the floor as a scream rips from my throat.

Shadow looked like Shadow, but was now actively morphing into some stretched and skewed version of him. I heard snapping as he grew unfathomably, quite quickly I’ll add, before his neck became too long to hold up on its own. His head fell to the wooden floor with a thud. My dog–or, what *was* my dog–smiled, then with its newly elongated limbs, started pushing its still bursting body towards me with too fast of a pace.

I don’t think I’ve ever run so fast in my life. The stairs to my attic area, where my bedroom is, are luckily accessed through the kitchen. I sprinted up them, straight to my room and slammed my door shut just as too-large of paws thud up the stairs after me. I’ve always loved that my space has hidden pocket doors, but now I’m not so keen.

Just as I turned the tiny lock on my door, the door started shaking on its track as the exploded version of my dog started banging on it. I thought myself brilliant for choosing my bedroom over the office or the closet, since this room is the only one of the three with a window. 

The first thing I did was race over to my window. It opens right to the roof of my attached garage, which would make for a relatively easy escape. I was halfway there, feeling the rough shingles under my bare feet before I looked up and noticed my nextdoor neighbor, Hunter, staring out of his window and directly into mine.

I yelled his name, telling him I needed help, but he just stood there, staring at me. He smiled quickly, raising his hands up for a moment, then his smile faded as his hands moved down slowly. He did it again, then again, and by the third time I was already terrified. He made it worse when the fourth time, he kept his hands raised and the grin plastered on his face.

He stared at me, then wiggled his fingers. Had the lights in his room not been on, it’d have been impossible to read his lips. They were on though, and as I read the words, “Gotcha!” he, too, started sporadically snapping and stretching into something inhuman. I scurried over to the edge of my roof, and just before I leaped over the edge, a shadowy figure in the middle of the road shifted, scraping the gravel beneath it.

I froze and watched it for a moment. When it didn’t start exploding, I felt relief, which went away as fast as it came when the figure started running towards me. I screamed again and then looked back into my bedroom. The door was holding true, but banging against its track like nobody's business. Another glance to Hunter, still in his window peering over at me, showed that he no longer resembled anything close to human.

He reminded me of those snake fireworks that you light and they just grow and grow until they turn to ash and fizzle out. All the color had removed itself from his skin, his eyes were gaunt, and he just kept stretching. I thought, *fuck this,* and crawled back into my bedroom. That’s when the banging on my door stopped and the singing started.

*I’m verily merrily but here quite contrarily, why don’t you let me in?*

*Don’t be afraid, I’ll be quick, let you live, promise I just want your skin!*

*Why don’t you let me in?*

I scrambled for my phone for almost a full minute before I realized I left it on the couch. Thankfully, my laptop still has a little bit of juice in it. Shitty thing is, none of my messages will go through. I can’t send chats, emails, nothing. I’ve run out of options so I’m going to try posting this as a last ditch effort. 

I’m not sure what to do. Has anybody else experienced this shit? What the fuck do I do? The fucking thing that took over my dog won’t stop singing the same thing over and over, though the lyrics have changed in the last few seconds.

*Why don’t you let me in? Let me in? Let me in?*

*Let me in! Let me in!*

*LET ME IN!*

*LET ME IN.*

The weed I smoked was near the end of my stash and I didn’t have near an experience like this any other time I’ve smoked it, so it feels safe to rule out. If I don’t make it through the night, and it comes out that I’ve been found as a curled up, ashen turd, please heed this warning. 

Whatever is making these midwestern night skies pink and red, isn’t the Northern Lights. I think it’s something evil. If you do get a glimpse, you might just want to let them in. Because right now, that’s the only thought running through my head.

That, and a jingle that’s becoming incessant enough I’m starting to hum it.

*Quite contrarily, I’m here and verily merrily, I think I’ll let them in!* 

*I won’t be afraid, they’ll be quick, let me live, they just want my skin!*

*I think I’ll let them in!*
