On my 17th birthday my dad announced that he’d be building me my own place. Not really anything fancy but a small tiny home on the corner of our 1 acre lot. 

I was so excited.i was always pretty independent, which made it hard for me to live alongside him and my stepmother. I’ve always been good at cleaning and cooking but I never really kept up with my chores as I constantly felt eyes watching me. Judging how I washed the dishes or cleaned the floors. So when my dad told me I’d have my own space I was ecstatic. 

It took maybe a couple months to build. We had to level the foundation and build the walls. But once we finished it was perfect. A bunk bed in the corner of the room. A fold up desk that I could also use as a dining table. I even got to choose the color of the kitchen cabinets. 

I absolutely loved it. I saved up my allowance and bought some decor and a mini fridge. Eventually once I moved in though I realized I had no storage. I complained to my dad and he decided to help build a small crawl space underneath the floor. It took him a long time but once it was finished it worked great. I could store about 5 plastic tubs underneath which was more then enough space. I threw down a bucket or two then got back to my normal single living life.

I spent most of my days inside, working on homework and messing around with my guitar. It seemed so great. I didn’t have to be nagged to do my chores and I could play as loud as I wanted, any time of the day. Eventually when winter came I heard a lot of scratching coming from the crawl space. I figured it was just rats trying to hide from the cold and tried my best to ignore it. Until my dog Parker wouldn’t stop scratching and whining at the trap door. Eventually I got I little worried and decided to open up the door. I pulled open the lock and tossed it onto the counter then lifted the door to see nothing but an empty dirt hole. To bins sitting side by side. “See it’s nothing” I told Parker and then closed to door before hopping into bed. I soon feel asleep and was wrapped up cozily in my blanket. Until i heard a heavy, steady breathing coming from my left side. A big breath in, then out. I could feel the hot breath on the back of my neck but didn’t dare turn around the second I remembered I forgot to but the lock back on the crawl space. I sat in silence for hours until the sun began to rise. Then suddenly the breathing stopped. Quick footsteps scurried through the room and suddenly the hinges of the trap door creaked. I didn’t bother wanting for the door to even close. I shot out of bed, holding Parker in arms and dashed straight back to my parents house. The snow freezing my feet as I ran closer and closer. Until I collapsed onto my their porch, tears pouring down my face. 

After that night I refuse to live alone again.
