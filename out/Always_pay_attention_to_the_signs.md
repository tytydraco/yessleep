 I was driving on I-90 through Ohio on my way to visit family in New York when I realized I was almost out of gas with no exits in sight. I sighed, turned off the AC, and started looking for the next exit while praying that God would let me make it to the next gas station.  My car had just started beeping at me because the gas gauge was under the empty line when I saw an exit. It didn't have one of those signs telling me that there was gas, lodgings, food, etc but I didn't have a choice. 

  
  I drove up the exit ramp and turned right toward some cornfields. I finally found a little town with a beautiful BP sign right in the middle and I coasted in on fumes. I'm one hundred percent sure that I used up the last drop of gasoline getting to the pump. It did seem weird to me, though, because I usually get about 350 miles on a full tank of gas and I was sure I hadn't driven that far so I filled up and asked the cashier if there was a mechanic near by. There was: his shop was directly behind the gas station.   

  
  After a brief conversation with the mechanic, I handed over my keys and went off down the block to the local mom & pop restaurant where I had a delicious meal and sat reading for a while. The mechanic had told me that it would be a few hours before he would know anything, so I had plenty of time. It was such an idyllic little town that I decided to see if there was a park within walking distance. I was thrilled when the waitress told me that there was a playground with some shade trees a few blocks to the east. I picked up my book and the Styrofoam cup she'd put my iced tea in then headed to the park. I smiled and turned left as I passed a sign saying “caution: children at play” and another one saying “par closes at dusk” looking forward to spending some relaxing time before paying a bunch of money and getting back into my car for a few more hours. 

  
  It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon so I expected to see kids playing when I got to the playground and I wasn't disappointed: when I got there, I saw all the typical equipment ringed with benches and surrounded by a chain link  fence. There were probably fifteen kids running, climbing, and swinging inside the playground so I sat on one of the benches under a tree and watched the kids play. I watched as one of the girls ran up to a little boy, tapped his shoulder, and yelled “You're it” before running off in the opposite direction. The boy screamed with delight and ran off after the other child. The whole scene made me laugh along with the kids until the boy caught the girl and the game came to an end.   

  
  After a few minutes of watching, the little girl came over to me and grinned, showing me her adorable dimples as she did. “Hi, lady.” I greeted her back and laughed as the kids came running over to crowd around us. “Do you want to play with us?” The children all clapped when I nodded and stood up. Their excitement was contagious, and we had the best time running and chasing and laughing until I was out of breath and needed a rest.   

  
  I made my way over to the bench and took a drink while I pulled out my phone to see what time it was and figure out how much longer before I could go get my car. I was surprised to find that over an hour had passed and then I realized that the sun was low in the sky; it was getting close to dusk. I wondered how strict the town was going to be about the park closing, then quickly dismissed that thought: I didn't even remember there being a gate on the fence. 

  
  After my rest, I jogged back to the middle of the playground to get back into the game just as one of the boys tapped another and yelled “You're it!” By the time that kid tagged a red headed girl, the sun had set and the streetlights were coming on. I took a step back, intending to get my stuff and head back to the mechanic shop as I hear her shout “Here I cooooooome!” I paused for a second because that didn't sound like the voice of a little girl at all. After a glance back over my shoulder confirmed that nothing seems to be unusual, I continued on my way to scoop up my things and then I heard a scream. I immediately turned toward the sound and I saw the red headed girl on top of a smaller boy, her face pressed to his neck. I ran over to try to break them apart and was shocked when I saw blood on the boy's shoulder and the girl's mouth. I yanked the girl away from the boy scolding her, asking what on earth she was doing. As I picked her up, another kid ran close to her and I saw her hand flash out as she grunted “You're it!” The grin on the face of the other child was wrong; very wrong. It was too white and too pointed and too predatory. I dropped the girl who ran away laughing and turned to run to the fence, hoping I could make it to the exit fast enough to avoid getting tagged by the boy with the shark smile. I don't know why I thought getting out of the playground would make me safe, but that's where my mind went, so my body followed.   

  
  I weaved around a few children on my way across the playground, almost falling over when one of them ran into me, and then I tripped on a stone and crashed into the fence near where I had entered the playground. I was shocked to find that there was, in fact, a gate and it was locked. I couldn't get out and I didn't know what the kids might be capable of if they tagged me. So I ran.   

  
  I followed the perimeter of the fence, hoping for a way out: an opening in the fence or a hill where the fence wasn't quite so high or something like that. I could hear another child screaming and then there was sudden,deafening silence. When I looked over my shoulder, the children were nowhere to be seen. I picked up my pace, grateful for my years of daily running which kept me from being out of breath because panting would prevent me from hearing the occasional skittering behind me.   

  
  As the stars came out, I heard a chorus of “Tag! You're it” as the children tagged each other then screams. Another glance over my shoulder showed me that the kids were tackling and biting each other. The tacklers were lapping at the blood from the wounds until the tackled kid escaped and chased down another kid. I made it back around to the locked gate and I thought that the kids had forgotten about me until I saw the kid with the shark smile running my way, still grinning. So, I tossed my bag over the fence and started climbing. It shouldn't have taken me as long as it did to get over a playground fence but it took long enough that the kid was able to grab my ankle and bite my calf. I screamed and kicked downward, dislodging the teeth and feeling a chunk of flesh rip away. I was glad for the lock on the gate when I flipped over the top of the fence and dropped to the ground.   

  
  When I made it back to my car, the mechanic tended my wound and tutted at me, “Stayed in the park after sunset, didja? You're a lucky one. Next time, pay attention to the signs, jackass.” 

  
  It's been a couple of weeks since then. Of course, no one believed my story. I have a plan, though: I've invited my sister to visit me for a while and we will be driving back through that little town. I'm going to definitely pay attention to the signs and be outside the park before the sun goes down.
