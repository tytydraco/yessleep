Every single night since I got married four years ago, I've had the same dream. They say a nightmare is your subconscious manifesting what you fear most and in my case, truer words were never spoken.

Monsters and demons do little in the way of frightening me so I never think about them. My wife's infedelity with my best friend behind my back on the other hand, terrifies me.

It's something I think about a lot.

Between you, me, and the lampost, my wife is out of my league so it's possible that these dreams stem from the insecurity of a man who is punching above his weight class. It's damn hard being a homely balding man with a bombshell wife. It's harder still when your tall and handsome best friend Jason, who introduced the two of you used to sleep with her.

Last night's dream was no different than the others. It began in the same manner as the ones that preceded it with the song of my alarm clock.

In a dream you can be like anyone you want. You aren't bound to the habits and shortcomings of your waking self. Dreams are the ultimate refuge of the weak and the meager. A domain free of constraints or fear. A universe where you are finally master of your own destiny.

That's the best I can describe how I am when the nightmare begins. It's apparent that I'm dreaming because I feel powerful, aware and confident. A stark contrast to the real world where I am none of those things.

I must be a mundane human being because this recurring nightly vision is filled with my day to day life instead of sex with models or adventures in fantastical far away lands.

Four years straight of this broken record of a reverie, and even while unconscious I can lucidly predict what happens next.

Instead of hitting snooze on my cellphone as I would in real life, I fling the covers off of me getting to my feet rapidly, wearing nothing but my boxer shorts and eyeing my beautiful wife already dressed in her yoga outfit that leaves little to the imagination.

Seated at her vanity, tying her long auburn hair into a ponytail, she meets my gaze in the mirror. 

"Morning, panda bear!" she smiles.

I offer no reply as I stomp over to her while grabbing a fistful of her freshly tied hair, jerking it back abruptly to force her eyes up to me. Enjoying the look she's never given me in real life.

A combination of fear and arousal.

She's too stunned to speak as I trace my finger around her lips before kissing her hard and pulling her up from her chair, hair still in hand.

I use my body weight to push her up against the nearest wall.

"Never call me that again." I whisper in Sandy's ear with authority.

I can feel her melt into me with the shiver she gave as my hand traveled up her inner thigh. 

"Wha-" she begins before being interrupted with another kiss. Feeling the heat her body was emitting as I dominated her coupled with the sound of her quick labored breath in my ear is always enough to cause my hands to shake with adrenaline. I won't lie to you, I very much enjoy this part of the dream. It's what I imagine men like Jason feel like everyday.

Powerful.

In some small way I'm thankful that I get to experience this passion that men like me rarely do, even if only until I wake up.

I release her and make my way over to our in room bathroom. Throwing a glance over my shoulder at her where she stands awkwardly up against that wall. Her face flushed, nipples now clearly visible under her skin tight t-shirt. I watch them rise and fall with every deep breath she takes.

I close the door behind me when she finally speaks.

"Dear lord in heaven, pand-" she catches herself. "Sammy."

I smile at myself in the mirror at this victory as I turn the faucet.

"My goodness!" she continues, "I'm late for my yoga class." I hear her pick up the duffle bag from the floor, "but when you get back from work, I want to see some more of... whatever that was!" Her voice becoming smaller with each footstep she takes toward our front door. "Have a good day, love you!"

When the front door locks behind her, I exit the bathroom. I pick up my phone from the nightstand to call my boss and wait for him to answer. 

"Hiya Sam!" his stupidly happy "morning person" voice greets me."What can I do you for?" He giggles.

"You can shut the fuck up!" I respond mimicking his happy tone perfectly.

"Excu-" he begins apprehensively.

"No no, none of that." I cut him off, shushing him. "I hate your stupid voice." I chuckle. "Don't speak, just listen."

This is another part of this that I enjoy immensely. It's the secret wish of almost every working man to be able to tell his boss where he can stick it. I savor every word that escapes my lips, leaving behind a sweet after taste on this newfound silver toungue.

"I gotta get something off my chest." I inhale deeply before starting. "I hate your stupid voice, I hate your stupid face, I hate your stupid company, and in the name of all things good and holy, your wifes meat loaf is disgusting."

He gasps through the wire.

"Fuck you Carl!" I laugh at his shock. "Fuck you, you stupid ugly son of a bitch, I quit!" I don't even take the time to hang up the phone. I just wind up like a baseball pitcher and throw it with all my might against the bedroom wall causing a substantial dent where my wife stood moments earlier. Admiring the beautiful intricacies of the phones shattered glass where it rests on the floor. 

I whistle to myself as I put one of my blazer jackets on. Approving of my fashion choice combination of underwear and suit jacket in the full length mirror by the door.

Being caught without pants in a dream seems to be the fear of every character in almost all of the sitcoms I've watched. In my case however, I find it oddly empowering. 

I leave the door to my house open behind me and enjoy how the grass of my lawn feels between my toes as I survey the prison known as the suburbs. 

My nosy next-door neighbor Carol is out tending to her flowers, staring at me from bended knee. Garden spade hanging loosely in her gloved hand.

"Um... Good morning Sam." She calls out confused but waving. "Got the day off work?"

I can't contain my laughter as I shift my body in her direction. "Ah Carol." I smile. "You nosy joyless bitch of a woman, how the hell are ya?" Folding my arms over my chest in mock interest.

Her mouth hangs open at my response.

"Cat got your tongue?" I say taking a step towards her. "That's incredible, I never thought I'd see the day you went silent." Another step. "That's probably why your husband left you, you know?" Mere feet away from her now never halting my approach. "You just can't shut the fuck up." I stop at the foot of her garden. Towering over the clearly frightened woman staring up at me with her mouth still agape. "And speaking of cats, if I catch yours shitting on my lawn again-" I bend my body to put my lips right against her ear. "I'll fucking skin it, then I'll fucking skin you!"

She screams as I abruptly stand, raising my foot before bringing it down with all of my strength on her precious tulips. Repeating the process over and over until every single flower is flattened into the earth. Much in the same way Godzilla stomps buildings in a Japanese B-movie. Laughing hysterically all the while. 

"Bye Carol!" I scream after the old woman as she flees as fast as her fat legs can carry her away from me. "Can't wait to see what casserole you make for the next neighborhood council meeting!"

I laugh as I fish in my pocket for the car keys to the candy apple red convertible Mazda Miata my wife asked me to buy for her. I laugh at its musical beep as I remotely unlock the doors on the way, and I laugh harder still at the ridiculous sound this tiny engine makes upon ignition in comparison to my black BMW that Sandy takes instead.

I switch on the stereo as I peel down my street, tires screeching in the process. "And I would do anything for love!" I scream, singing along to the 90's Meatloaf hit that blares full blast through the speakers of the Miata as I drive like a madman to Jason's house. Laughing at the zombies that inhabit this city as they dive out of the way of the speeding vehicle that blows every stop light and traffic sign on the way to its destination. Thinking they really should be thanking me for the thrill I'm providing for their empty domesticated lives. "And these are the days that never end!" I continue bellowing along with the singer. Feeling the wind rustle in my hair as I drive the pedal down further with my dirty bare foot.

I kill the ridiculous engine and exit the vehicle when I arrive. I notice my black BMW parked in Jason's driveway and run my hands over its sharp curves that are warm to the touch from being out in the sun. They must think so little of me to have the audacity to keep their evidence out in broad daylight.

Still humming the song of my journey as I use the spare key he gave me years earlier to water his plants while he was away on business, gaining entrance.

I shut the door behind me and draw the curtains. The bed creaks loudly and rhythmically from the upstairs bedroom. Accompanied by the soft moaning of my wife and the percussion of skin on skin contact, musically tying together the symphony of adultery.

I walk up the stairs snapping my fingers in time with its tempo which is remarkably similar to Billy Jean. Bobbing my head to its beat and when I reach the top, I break out into my best moonwalk towards the source of the music.

The door is slightly ajar and I can't help but notice a marble ashtray on the chest of drawers that faced the bed. Two half smoked cigarettes left smoldering in their own embers. 

Funny, Sandy demanded I quit smoking on our wedding day, she said she disliked the smell.

Another striking example of her hypocrisy is the fact that she is faced down as he takes her from behind, knuckles white as she clutches the mattress. A position she told me she wasn't comfortable with. 

She looked plenty comfortable to me.

Tempo never missed a beat. Jason, to his credit, is at the very least consistent.

The door squeaks as I push it open further, alerting the lovers to my presence. Passing its threshold, I head straight to the cigarettes. I pick up the one closest to me and puff on it a few times to get it hotter.

"Shit..." Jason begins as he wraps one of the sheets around his waist while dismounting my wife in a panic.

"Panda bear!" Sandy chimes in, pivoting and pulling up a spare pillow to cover her breasts. 

All I can do is laugh at the futility of this motion of hers. "No need to cover up sweetheart." I say putting out the cigarette in the ashtray I now held in my hand before picking up the other and repeating the process. "Everyone has already seen what you got." I beam while shimmying my shoulders.

Silence can be incredibly loud at times.

Jason has both knees on the mattress and walking over to him I notice that that makes us nearly the same height. It's strange looking level into the eyes of a man you're usually forced to look up to.

"Sam, listen to me." He says with one hand securing his makeshift toga the other motioning up and down for me to be calm.

I take one last haul of my cigarette as I stand before him, butting it out before I expel the smoke into his face.

"You know what Jason?" Barring my teeth. "I don't think that I will." I place my free hand on his bare shoulder. "But take a look at my wife over there, I'm sure she'll buy whatever it is you're selling." I gesture in her direction with my head. 

He turns to look at her and I seize the opportunity to bring the heavy ashtray down onto the back of his skull. 

A dull thud fills the air which is cut by the sharp screams of my wife.

His limp body falls forward into my waiting arms and I shift myself to the left dropping him to the floor. Humming now. 

"Sam please!" Sandy pleads wide eyed and terrified. "I'm sorry!"

"No you're not." I wink at her as I throw a leg over Jason who lay on his back. "At least-" I say descending on top of him, sitting on my heels and watching as this handsome man looks up at me, eyes fluttering, waiting patiently as his disoriented mind makes the connection of what's to come. "-not yet." Smiling at him when it does.

"Please." He whimpers as I hover the ashtray above my head.

The sound his skull makes when first struck with the marble, cracks so loudly that it reverberates off the walls. By the seventh or so, its muted to the sound of crunching leaves in autumn. By the seventeenth, just wet thumping which continues until the ashtray is too heavy to lift. 

"Oh God, what a rush!" I yell while panting. My left eye twitching at the sting of one the stray drops of blood that speckles my face. 

My naked wife sobs in the background, trying to make herself as small as possible against the tufted headboard of the bed, trembling violently.

She gasps and pleads with me as I walk toward her. She continued to plead as I climbed on top of her. She pleaded at me with her eyes when my hands around her neck stifled her voice, making speech an impossibility.

When it's done and my wife lay dead, I fish around her purse to retrieve my car keys and I drive home in my black BMW as a symbol of my victory. Top down, breathing in the afternoon air aromatized with the scent of freshly mown lawns and hot pavement. I wave at the passerby's who cover the eyes of their children as they oggle the half naked man covered in blood. I flip Carol the finger as she stares at me through the blinds when I arrive and I light another cigarette as I close the door that was already left open of my house. A smile breaks at my lips as it dangles and I let out a sigh of happiness from the seat of my sofa.

That's when I wake up. Drenched in sweat, hands shaking at my remorseless ferocity. 

Though, that hasn't happened yet.

Four years straight of this exact dream and its never lasted this long. It always ends with the smile. Yet here I am on the sofa, cigarette long since butted out on my coffee table, waiting to wake up.

I write this to you now as blue and red lights fill my living room, casting sporadic shadows on the floor.

Waiting still.

If this post goes through, then I'm not asleep and I'm living a dream come true.

I can't help but laugh out loud at the irony of it all. It took me to think I was asleep to finally summon the courage to open my eyes.

I won't be going outside despite the man on the loud speaker demanding that I do so, with my hands on my head no less.

I'll end it myself. Because for the first time in my life, I am the master of my own destiny.

Free.

I laugh even harder at that.

Because who else could truly say that they've lived their wildest dreams.
