Okay, if it were up to me, a demon wouldn’t be cutting open into my shoulder every night.

Although, if it were *also* up to me, I wouldn’t be spending the eve of my seventeenth birthday boxed up in a sleep clinic, so I guess we can’t always get what we want. To Sleep and Sound’s credit, however, it was one of the more comfortable clinics I’d been to in the past year. For one, it nested within the cushy confines of a literal mansion, a dream really, which should’ve already made me feel like a princess. The doctor’s office itself was just as grand, resembling those old Victorian parlors I liked sketching as a kid back home in Annapolis. 

The many bookcases and fancy clocks created a rather distinct ambiance, a more welcoming one than the other ones I’d been to. A series of kaleidoscopic paintings graced the walls, only making the setting more vibrant, as did the drapes rippling down like waterfalls in nearly all four corners of the room. The fireplace’s sweeping shine even managed to reach the plush armchair I occupied, warm and kindly as if they were an old friend.  

But it didn’t feel very friendly. 

In fact, the room appeared empty, hollow. Dead.

I would’ve maybe—just maybe—been able to power through if the dark mist hadn’t returned, the mist you’d expect to loom over graveyards or  curl around headstones and frost out all your sense of worth. It had wrapped around me like icy links of steel, its cold permeating through my skin and creeping upward, making my teeth chatter, and giving me those dreaded tremors. I couldn’t let the cold reach my eyes. I couldn’t let it glaze them over and distract me from the root cause of all this misery. The object from my nightmares—the mirror. 

Despite its missing entourage of cracks and vines, it was a mirror nonetheless, hanging near one of the bookcases in all its gloomed glory. It served as a haunting reminder for the nights I’d suffered through and with it came the mist. The guaranteed chill that’d shoot up my spine. Although that wasn’t what struck fear into my heart, no. 

It was that wretched spawn of Satan which followed. 

A single earbud unevenly blared music from my old, beat-up iPod as I quickly glanced at the mirror’s owner, waiting for him to say something. I couldn’t bear the silence any longer—that’s when the mist had the strongest hold on me. But nothing. The doctor still sat comfortably in his own armchair, combing through a labyrinth of old notes; his soft, doe-like eyes perusing; his fingers stroking the ends of his salt and pepper beard; his calm, collected demeanor somehow persevering as he soaked in the horrors secreting from the pages. 

This man, Dr. Yusuf Mustafa, was unfortunately my last hope. 

If one of the best somnologists in the country couldn’t save me—no one could. Papá had to quite literally scrape up the last of our savings to even *afford* this first consultation. Yet my heart ached at the thought. Here I was, souring, moaning, complaining, while my father plugged away like a workhorse to whisk me from clinic to clinic. The mist grew more sinister as the guilt tore me up from the inside, and my eyes naturally snapped back to the mirror. Maybe it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world if the demon had its way with me—

*No,* I thought hurriedly. *This isn’t productive. Come on, happy thoughts, Sofia! There have to be happier things to think about than the evil sleep monster, right?*

Luckily, I didn’t have to find these so-called “happy thoughts” because Dr. Mustafa had finally cleared his throat, jolting me out of my frigid trance.

“Sofia Ruiz, yes?” 

“Y-yeah, that’s me,” I said, forcing myself to focus on the doctor again. The name sounded foreign, almost like it didn’t belong to me. “Sofia Ruiz.”

“Soon to be seventeen years old, I believe,” Dr. Mustafa said with a smile as he neatly tucked away the papers back into the hefty file, setting it aside. “Any plans for the big day?”

*Nope.*

“Yup,” I said. “Lots. Pancakes, a few pedicures, maybe a surprise party. I mean, obviously, I don’t know anything because it’s a surprise, but I’ll definitely act surprised when they surprise me… with the, um, surprise party.”

*Smooth.*

Dr Mustafa’s smile only widened, however. “Good, good. In case this consultation runs short, although it is quite late already, a very happy birthday from our side. If you’d like, you can grab an extra peppermint or two from the front desk afterward.”

I tried to return the smile, but it probably came out as a pained grimace. “Right, will do. Thanks.” 

“You’re very welcome, Ms. Ruiz,” The doctor said before adjusting his sleeves in an almost business-like fashion. “So, let’s begin, shall we? How familiar are you with sleep paralysis?”  

“Oh, very familiar.” I shifted uncomfortably in the armchair, fidgeting with my iPod. “It’s not exactly fun. Basically hell, but a thousand times worse. You can’t move. Can’t breathe. Hallucinations.”

“Indeed. I understand these symptoms resonate with you?”

“Sure.” 

“And what is your experience if you don’t mind me asking? What do you see?”

“Things I feel like I shouldn’t be seeing,” I said, trying to construct my answer in a way that wouldn’t melt the doctor’s brain from the get-go—something told me colleges wouldn’t accept manslaughter as an extracurricular. “You know, like those beheading videos floating around online, or when you accidentally stumble upon your parents…” I resisted the urge to physically demonstrate the act using my fingers. “… procreating.”

*Ew. Procreating?*

Dr. Mustafa furrowed his eyebrows. “My apologies, but I’m having a hard time following.” 

“Look,” I said, squeezing my eyes shut. “I don’t know how to explain it, and I don’t know if you’re going to believe me. You’re probably going to say it’s all in my head; it’s an abstraction of grief, a manifestation of my trauma or whatever.” I stole a quick glance at the mirror. “But, hey, don’t worry, I know my mother’s gone. If she was here, I mean, she would be here, right? But this isn’t about her, it’s something way beyond that. Something different. Something *real*.” 

“Hm…” 

I didn’t dare break the uncomfortable silence that followed. I kept using my iPod’s click wheel to dial the volume up and down, reducing Bret Michael’s masterpiece of a bridge into a jumbled mess as Dr. Mustafa did nothing but pensively stroke the ends of his beard again. I half expected him to turn his back on me then like the others had— 

*No. Just… just try and stay calm. Deep breaths like the therapist-lady suggested. That’s right. In and out.*

“You know, Ms. Ruiz,” the doctor finally said, and my heart skipped a beat. “I’ve always tried to adhere to one simple principle: strive to be a father first and a doctor second.” He gestured at a framed picture to his side. A sharp sensation stabbed at my stomach, the cold now worse than before. The toddler in the picture sported a baggy cowgirl’s outfit, her pigtails barely peeking their way out of the straw hat and her delicate little fingers clutching onto a pumpkin bursting with candy. It wasn’t the costume or even the pumpkin which had snared my attention—but her *smile*. 

I had a nasty feeling that this smile didn’t last. 

Dr. Mustafa continued to gaze at the picture wistfully. “You see, you learn more as a parent than you ever could otherwise. Especially when it comes to understanding people. Their ups and downs, their hopes and aspirations, their greatest fears—*everything*. There’s a reason why so many of my patients continue to seek help from us here at Sleep and Sound. They don’t seek just a diagnosis but a solution. Medication can help but the solution itself always lies up here.” He tapped his temple with a fountain pen. “And helping the patient find it is only possible if we truly understand them. So, of course, I will believe you as I’ve seen it all in the nineteen years I’ve been practicing somnology. Trust me, I don’t have a choice *but* to believe you if we are to find your solution.” 

Another stretch of silence; but this time, however, it wasn’t as uncomfortable. I stopped messing around with the iPod, making full, long-lasting eye contact with the doctor for the first time.

He didn’t just sound like he believed the words coming out of his mouth, no, he actually *looked* like he did. That look was rare. So rare, in fact, that I’d never seen it chiseled upon any of my other doctors’ faces before. On the off-chance Dr. Mustafa was faking it, props to the guy; seriously, if this somnology thing didn’t work out, Hollywood would make the perfect safety net. 

“Oh,” I said, finally reaching toward my buzzing earbud, killing the music. “Wait, seriously? You’re being one-hundred-percent serious right now? Like, I mean, *serious* serious?” 

“Of course I am. I certainly can’t help a patient I don’t have faith in, can I?”

“Right… good point.” I hesitated. “Um, well, thanks. That means a lot then.”

Dr. Mustafa smiled. “My pleasure.”

A small smile began to tug at the ends of my lips too. “So… so does this mean that big brain of yours has already cooked up a potential theory or two? Seeing as you believe me and all?”

“I’m afraid it’s a little premature for that,” Dr. Mustafa said with a laugh, fixing the pen near the top of his notepad. “But we can start from the beginning. I’m assuming you know when paralysis should usually set in?”

“Either before falling asleep or waking up.”

“Precisely.” 

“Precisely,” I repeated. “But that’s not when I get them. It’s always—”

“—from 3:00 to 3:03 in the morning as per your records,” Dr. Mustafa said. “Which is strange because you’re neither falling asleep nor waking up then. Plus, the consistent nature of the condition is highly abnormal. Sleep paralysis shouldn’t be this precise in its timings.”

*Halle-freaking-lujah.* A colossal wave of relief spread through my body, distracting me from the biting mist and swaddling me like a blanket. Finally, someone was listening. Finally someone *understood*. Again, if the doctor was faking it, I wouldn’t be surprised to see him star in the next big medical drama that sweeps the nation.

Wrapped up in my newfound jubilation, I didn’t even realize the doctor was talking again, however. “—the mechanics of the paralysis are certainly interesting, but what I think I’m most curious about are these unexplained injuries noted in your medical file.” Dr. Mustafa looked up from his notepad. “Mind if I take a look?”

And that’s when I heard the clock’s chime, a resounding echo thumping near the back of my mind, and I regretted parting ways with my earbuds at once. Feelings of comfort transformed into a burgeoning sense of foreboding, crawling its way down my throat and knotting my stomach into bowlines; the mist; the one, single chime; and then, I could almost feel the demon’s fingernails burrowing into my skin. There it was. The *real* object of my nightmares. A grimy mirror, fracturing, smothered by a gnarl of wilting vines—  

“Ms. Ruiz?”

The mirror vanished. I was in the office, sitting in front of Dr. Mustafa. He regarded me with an admittedly valid look of concern. 

I blinked a couple times before speaking. “Sorry. I… I spaced out for a second. What were you saying?”

“Well, I was saying,” the doctor continued, eyebrows raised, “that I wanted to see the injuries described in your records. The ones on your left shoulder.”

“Right. Injuries.” My fingers inched toward the infamous shoulder. The genesis of it all, exhibiting a symptom doctors were always quick to dismiss. I couldn’t even blame them. There wasn’t an explanation in the millions of hours they suffered through in med-school that could begin to rationalize this phenomenon. 

“You don’t have to if you’re unsure,” Dr. Mustafa said as if he could read my mind. “What you wish to disclose is up to you. However, it might be helpful from a medical standpoint to have the full picture.”

“N-no,” I croaked. “I can show you.It’s just… a little sensitive, I guess.”

“I promise I’ll be careful.” Dr. Mustafa got to his feet. “Roll up your sleeve whenever you’re ready.”

I did as instructed, albeit somewhat reluctantly. I really was an idiot. Sure, the doctor may have believed me up till now, but after seeing the injuries, there was no way he’d continue to, right? I pulled Mamà’s old Huskur Du hoodie over my head and tossed it onto a nearby fainting couch and rolled up the left sleeve of my T-shirt. I couldn’t help but side-eye the mirror again, waiting for the demon to make its appearance. Waiting for it to beg. Plead. Claw its way out to stop Dr. Mustafa before he saw—before he believed. There was an unexpected click and a beam of light flashed in front of my face, forcing my eyelids shut. 

*Jesus*. 

“Sorry about that,” Dr. Mustafa muttered, and the light dimmed. I allowed my eyes to open a little, red spots continuing to blast through my vision as the doctor’s face trickled back into focus. Standing nearby, he continued tinkering with the only modern appliance in the room: an LED lamp. 

“That should do it,” he grunted once the lamp stopped freaking out.

My eyes fixed themselves on the carpet again. “So, can you… can you see them?” 

“Just give me a moment,” Dr. Mustafa said, leaning in closer. “Hm.”

“What? What is it?” My heart pumped faster. 

“I’ve never seen scars like these before,” the doctor whispered, even closer now. “Especially in this configuration. They look like—”

“Letters?” I finished the sentence. “Yeah. I know.”

“What did you say has been attacking you, again, Ms. Ruiz?” 

I pursed my lips. “I don’t think I did say. Not yet anyway.”

“Your file mentioned a monster. Did this monster play a part in inflicting these injuries?”

Another flash. The mirror. But it wasn’t exactly my reflection staring back at me through the cracks and vines. A flickering figure. Its nose like mine, but crooked. Its hair like mine, but darker, choppier; filthy and matted. Its mouth like mine, but caked with dried blood. Fangs in place of human teeth, yellow foam oozing out from in between and razor sharp talons germinating from its fingers. Its bloody, paper-thin eyes splashed with the same shade of terror as my own. The smell of rotten eggs infiltrated my nostrils, like it always did whenever it was close. 

“Demon.” I’d snapped myself out of the memory. My nails dug into either side of the armchair, the acrylics tearing their way into the upholstery threading. I was shivering much worse than before. “Sorry, I-I call it a demon but not important. At first, I thought it was just a nightmare. A recurring one. The demon would stand there, staring at me. Lashing out only toward the end. Its arm would phase through the glass and then… I’d wake up. In the morning, when my alarm goes off. That’s how it started anyway.”

“And then what did it become?” 

“R-real,” I said, having to clamp my teeth together to stop them from chattering. If I’d been feeling cold before, it was *nothing* compared to the snowstorm I was experiencing now. 

“Real?” Dr. Mustafa repeated. His voice was so soft that I could almost hear his heartbeat. 

“Yeah,” I said, and the muscles in my jaw tightened. “I didn’t notice them initially, but the scratches were, um, beginning to show up here. In the real world. Little baby scars that appeared later in the day and faded slightly the next. It took seven weeks before the first letter was complete. An ‘H.’ I thought it was a coincidence until the demon finished hacking away the second letter three months later. Then the third. Now, almost the fourth.” 

Okay, this had to be it. Dr. Mustafa would have to be insane to buy into anything I’d said. Every doctor who’d seen the scars up till now thought the odd configurations were my own doing. They insisted therapy would be my best bet; that it’d been my mother’s untimely, horrifying passing which royally screwed me up. I knew why they thought that. It was because of the word constructed out of the disarray of scratches.

“But these letters,” Dr. Mustafa said in the same hushed tone. “They… they look like they spell out…?”

I turned to look at the doctor, stomach churning, and gave a weak nod. “*Help*.”

I'll be back with another update soon. Promise.
