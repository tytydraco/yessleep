I was sitting on the toilet at work scrolling through my phone when it flashed up on my screen, “100 000 cash prize, no sign up, free entry” I thought it might be a scam, but I still clicked on the link, I was confident that I'd be ok as long as I didn’t download anything. It took me to a blank page, the address was just a load of random numbers, there wasn’t even a dot or anything. Which only made me doubt myself even more, then the terms and condition’s window popped up and I just clicked on it. I didn’t mean to; it was just a reflex; things like that pop up on my phone multiple times a day and I have a habit of agreeing to them automatically. Which took me to the rules page.   
  
1. Once you start you have to play until the end. If you do not, you will be punished accordingly, if you try to avoid punishment, we will nominate someone of our chosen to take their place and they will receive a severe punishment every day for 5 days or until you return. After 5 days you will both be eliminated.   
  
2. If you fail to complete or lose your daily challenge you will lose one of your 10 digits, when all are lost you are out. This is final, no exception.    
  
3. Each challenge is tailored to a certain individual’s needs and has to be completed by said individual, any to attempt to share information whether intentional or not will be classed as cheating and you will be exterminated and so will any nominees that we might have assigned to you.   
  
There are 50 challenges of increasing difficulties, you will be sent a link at 9am every day and you will have until midnight to complete. Once all levels are completed you will be given a multiple-choice question, once completed, and remember there are no wrong answers, your prize will be delivered to the winner's address 60 days later.   
  
They really didn’t ask for any personal details, not even an email address so I thought what have I got to lose besides my time. Which I had a lot off since I started working security in a storage facility down in the docks. I was the only one there all day, so I spent a lot of time on my phone playing games anyways.   
  
When I clicked start at the bottom of the page this 80’s style 2D RPG pixelated game came up, where you have to navigate a guy through a building site without getting hurt. Which was pretty easy and took me maybe 30 minutes to complete. When I got home that night, I asked my son about it, he was a lot more up to date with shit like that, so I thought he might be able to help. But he didn’t know, or just didn’t care, he was stuck into his own game at the time. So, I googled it myself, but I couldn’t really find out anything about it, apart from it was a private company that specialized in market research. It didn’t make sense to me why a market research company were having a gaming competition or why they weren’t promoting it, since I assume would be the whole point of the competition in the first place. But at least it wasn’t a scam, I thought.   
  
I knew my chances of winning were pretty slim, it was 100 000, they weren’t just going to give it away so I didn’t really think of it after that. I just waited for the new levels to come in every morning, which were really random. One day I could be exploring the jungles in Africa, the next, I could be a businessman wondering through canary wharf in London, but the goal was always the same.    
  
It was a week in when I lost my first level, it wasn’t because it was hard, I was eating breakfast with my wife and wasn’t paying attention when she handed me a cup of hot coffee. Well, lets just say I got burned somewhere you don’t want to be burned and dropped my phone. When I picked my phone up, my guy had fallen off a curb and broken his leg. I didn’t really care at the time since I had 9 more lives.   
  
About an hour later my wife and I had just pulled up at the supermarket and I went to get a ticket. When suddenly out of know where this little kid came up behind me on his e-scooter and knocked me over. He didn’t even stop to see if I was ok, he just kept going. When I got up, I realized I had broken the little finger on my left hand. I spent the whole day in hospital getting it fixed. At that stage I didn’t put 2 and 2 together, I just assumed it was bad luck.    
  
The next day when the new level came in, I got through it easy enough, even with the broken finger since all I had to do was click on one of the three options that they gave me for every obstacle. But the day after that I fucked up again. This time it was my fault, I was scaling a mountain in the alps and took a wrong turn, my guy fell and broke his leg again. That night as I was walking out of the bathroom, there must have been a draft or something because the door slammed on my finger, almost cutting it off. The fucked-up thing was I had three fingers strapped together from the previous break, and only the middle one got damaged. The doctor said it was a miracle.   
  
The following evening, I had taken one too many painkillers and messed up another level. That night while I slept it happened again, I have no idea how, my best guess was it got caught up in the sheets and either me or my wife turned suddenly, and it snapped.    
  
It was when I was on my way to the emergency room that night when it all started to make sense to me, 3 fingers in a row broke in the same hand, the game said I would lose a digit if I lost a level. That can’t be true, I thought. But what if it was, the game was getting a lot harder, and I was losing finger’s fast, was it worth the risk? I was sure that I was just being paranoid, but to be safe I decided not to play the next day, just to see what would happen. Anyways, the rules did say someone else would get the punishment, maybe it would be someone who deserved it. I know I didn’t.   
  
The following day was probably the first day in years without me having my head stuck in my phone. My wife was over the moon, she thought I was doing it for her, since she was always begging me to put it down. But the truth was I was just too scared, I had no idea what would happen. I couldn’t even sleep that night; I was too busy trying to keep my fingers safe. But I woke up the next morning safe and sound, went to work and as the day went on I started to relax. Then that evening I got a phone call from my son's school notifying me that my son had been in an accident at school and was on his way to the hospital.   
  
He had broken his leg while playing football. My son doesn’t play football, I thought, not unless it’s the PC version. When I asked him about it later, he didn’t even know why he did it himself. He said he was sitting on the sidelines and suddenly got the urge to join in, the next thing he knew he was on the ground screaming in pain.   
  
After that I knew that I had to keep on playing, especially since my son was involved. After the toughest few months of my life, I finally made it to the last level, I was lucky too with only one digit left. It was by far the hardest, walking through a battlefield with tanks, guns and hidden mines going off everywhere. I chose every move carefully, so it took me almost the whole day to get through.   
  
When I crossed that line, I was so happy it was over that I had completely forgotten about the prize money until it popped up on the screen and to be honest, I didn’t care, I was just happy it was all over. “To finish the game and claim your 100 000 prize” it said, “choose who you want to share this opportunity with” But the choice was not an easy one, it had two of my closest friends ready for me to send it to and I had to pick one.    
  
I couldn’t do that to anyone, fuck the prize money. I thought as I watched the timer go to zero. “Call back tomorrow for your second choice” it said before I threw my phone the other side of the room in frustration. I didn’t know what it meant until the next day when I got a message from one of my friends thanking me for sending them the link.    
  
Moments later an alert popped up on my screen, it was my second choice. All I can say is, not making the choice the day before will forever haunt me because now I had to choose between my mom and my son. My son was good with games like call of duty and Fortnite, but he hated old games like this, so it was a death sentence for him. As for my mom, she did know her way around games like this in her day, but her head was not what it used to be, I barely survived it myself.   
  
It was the hardest decision I ever made, I would have chosen myself if I could, but I couldn’t without taking my son with me. In the end, I chose to save my son, he was young and had his whole life ahead of him.     
  
A few weeks later she was gone and so was my dad. They died in hospital after a string of unusual accidents.    
  
They didn’t lie about the prize money though, 60 days to the day I got a letter in the door notifying me that my 100 000-inheritance check had arrived at the lawyer's office for me to collect. Oh and the 2 friends that played, one survived but his wife didn’t. He blames me for everything of course, he beat me half to death when I showed up at her funeral. I knew I deserved it, so I didn’t even try to stop him.
