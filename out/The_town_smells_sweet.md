You know when you’re flicking through channels late at night, bored out of your mind? With each click of the remote, your eyelids get heavier and you’re debating just calling it a night and going to sleep. Then you find it: a cliché, dime-a-dozen feel-good movie. It’s way too bright, the acting is mediocre at best and the plot is so overused that you can practically predict everything. It’s bad and you know it’s bad but you just can’t not watch it. The town is always nauseatingly perfect. 

Spotless streets with not as much as a discarded piece of chewing gum, countless colorful family-owned shops and people so friendly that it feels like one big theme park. But it’s all a movie set, facades and props…or it usually is. 

I moved to Beraheim about two months ago. Yes, I know, it’s an odd name. My dad pranked me by saying it was in Norway. I almost believed him because I couldn’t find it on any US map. Turns out, it’s just a really small town. When I say that I mean that it has less people than my old school had students. The only store was a grocery store and a connected gas station with arcade machines. The people that lived in Beraheim had lived there for decades and you’d have better chances at winning the lottery than finding a bus out of town. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I didn’t hate this place when I first got here. My mom had us move a lot for her job so I was used to it. I’ve stayed in all kinds of places, so a small town wasn’t a new thing to me. It just surprised me how…shiny everything looked. Despite having a vintage feel, nothing looked old or depleted. Houses that looked straight out of an 80s sitcom were in perfect condition. The town had more money than I expected if they could afford all of this upkeep. 

Our new home was like a life-sized dollhouse. A pastel yellow and white exterior with an already flourishing garden. The inside was just as dazzling, with nearly sparkling wooden floors and cozy wallpaper. My brother Tyler scoffed at the place, saying it was way too bright. My parents were immediately infatuated and mom started looking through furniture catalogs immediately. We’d moved in the middle of summer and I still had four weeks until school started. As you can imagine I was extremely bored, I’d already drifted apart from my friends in the last town and Tyler was too occupied with his games. 

I ended up going with my dad to the store to pick up a few things to fill the empty fridge. As soon as we pulled into the parking lot a chill went down my spine, despite the 80 degree weather. Everyone in the parking lot was looking at us, as if we’d pulled up in a luxury car and not an old family van. Eyes bore into the back of my head as we entered the store. I met the gaze of a middle-aged woman, the bag of frozen fruit in her hand had started dripping dew onto the floor as she stared at me. I quickly ducked behind a shelf, never having felt more uncomfortable. My dad was focused on getting groceries so I stayed in the empty parts of the store. 

As I walked by the drinks I noticed how…lackluster the selection was. Where you’d normally see rows upon rows of soft drinks there was next to nothing. I picked up a glass bottle of cherry red soda, the label proudly displaying that was it made and bottled in Beraheim. It was nothing I recognized, but every place had their local soda. I put it back, despite how thirsty I’d gotten, weirdly enough it didn’t look appealing to me. At the front of the store, my dad was talking to the cashier as he bagged our groceries. “This place is so peaceful, you must have had so much fun growing up here”, dad said. The cashier, a guy who looked to be in his late teens, smiled widely and nodded. “Yes sir, I bet you’re going to love it here”, the guy said, his attitude peppy but his stare remained the same as everyone else’s. 

The summer sun burned into my shoulders as I dug the small trowel into the soil of our new front yard. My boredom had spawned a sudden willingness to help my parents with gardening. My dad couldn’t resist buying a few flowers to plant, despite the fact that we already had flourishing roses. It was a little bit odd, it didn’t look like it had rained for a while, yet the roses of a house that had been for sale were still vibrant and healthy. Maybe the real estate agents just found the gardens to be an important draw. 

The steel of my trowel plunged into the surprisingly soft soil. As i scooped up some of it, the color immediately threw me off. The soil was dark and clumpy and, most confusing of all, it looked wet. It had the sheen of fresh potting soil and I instinctively brought my head down to get a closer look. A smell filled my nostrils, a syrupy sweetness with an unpleasant undertone of something sharp. It made my stomach twist with how pungent it was. I was about to turn to my dad when I felt a tap on my shoulder. 

My mom stood there, smiling while holding a tray. She brought it down to me and I could see it was lemonade. “I know you’re bored honey but overheating isn’t very entertaining”, she laughed and I grabbed the glass closest to me. As soon as the taste hit my lips, I thought I’d bitten my tongue. The taste of iron flooded my mouth, the citrus and sugar seemed more like an aftertaste. I told myself that the house’s pipes probably hadn’t been used in a while, coupled with the fact that the plumbing was probably ancient. I turned my head and spat the lemonade back into the glass. I gritted my teeth and put the cup back on the tray. “Thanks mom, I think I’ll go inside for now”. 


Boiling the water before drinking it didn’t change the taste. Everything still had that persistent metal undertone. I asked my parents about it and they said they couldn’t taste anything. I had to ask an employee at the store if they had any bottled water, he came back with a dusty pallet but I took whatever I could get. I just couldn’t stand that salty iron taste. I took to wandering the town to keep myself busy. It was just as sparkling as our house with perfect, clean streets. 

The trees decorating the middle of the town square were just as lush as the flowers in our garden. The smell of fresh baked cake wafted through the air as the numerous bakeries and cafes opened for the day. It was overwhelming and I found myself a little nauseated. What town needed three bakeries on the same street? People were staring less, now they’d just smile politely when I walked past. Despite how warm they tried to make their smiles seem, they still looked too wide to me, like they were trying too hard. I thought I was just having a hard time adjusting. 

My family didn’t have the same problem. 

I came home to find Tyler playing catch with my dad in the backyard. Something you need to know about my dad is that he’s not the sporty type. I didn’t even know we owned any baseball gear. My little brother, who usually preferred to sit inside and play video games, was enthusiastically catching the baseball in his gloved hand. My mom was humming in the kitchen, taking a sizzling roast out of the oven. A pot of mashed potatoes sat bubbling on the stove. She’d always been a terrible cook, yet all the food looked straight out of a cookbook. 

You’re probably thinking it’s weird that I’m judging my family for making self improvements. It’s not just that though, it’s the way they talked too. Their voices were cheerful and almost animated as we ate dinner. Words flurried around me, I couldn’t recognize them as the voices of my family. I poked at my perfectly tender roast with my fork as I looked out the window. The flowers we had planted just a few days ago were blossoming beautifully, their petals so vibrant it hurt my eyes.

I finally saw other people my age. There was a group of teens in a field by the treeline leading into the forest. They were having a picnic, laughing and chatting as they drank that bright red soda. I made eye contact with a girl and she gave that unnervingly wide smile as she motioned for me to come over. “You’re the new kid, right? I’m Jane, do you want to join us?” She asked, patting an empty spot on the checkered picnic blanket. The feeling of unease in my chest was still present but I’ll be honest, I was pretty lonely and it was starting to overwrite that feeling. 

I sat down, taking a closer look at the group. The boys were all in neatly ironed polo shirts while the girls all had flowing summer dresses. I felt way out of place in my old shorts and t-shirt. Jane held out something to me, it was that crimson soda. She’d already opened it for me, the fizzing of the carbonation prickling my ears as the artificial cherry wafted up into my nose. 

“It’s a Beraheim staple! You’re gonna love it”, a boy said, raising his own half-empty bottle. I tried my best to smile as I began to notice that the earlier chatter had died down. Every pair of eyes were glued to me, looking expectantly…no, they were looking excitedly. Their smiles seemed less like friendly peers and more like grinning hyenas, waiting for their meal, their perfect teeth glistening. I shivered despite the sun on my back. I thought about making an excuse and leaving but before I could finish that thought, I was already bringing the bottle to my lips. 

What happened next is going to sound insane, but as soon as the sugary liquid ran down my throat, it was like all my worries fizzled away. I began to notice just how nice everything looked, the perfection that had disturbed me before now made me feel relaxed. The summer breeze carried the sweetness from the bakeries and I breathed it in. The faces of the kids around me looked friendly again and I couldn’t help but give them all a smile. A smile that wasn’t strained, a smile that felt sincere. 

The peace faded away after a few more seconds and it was like whiplash, my anxiety creeped back up into my chest, squeezing my heart. I almost wanted to down the whole bottle just to feel that peace again. I turned the soda in my hand and stared at the label, containing nothing but its name and the ‘made and bottled in Beraheim’ sticker. As the cherry flavor faded from my tongue I looked back up at the group. Their red-stained lips were all turned up into those sharp grins again. I excused myself and left the bottle standing in the vibrant emerald green grass. 

I didn’t want to go back into town with the smell of spongecake and the wide smiles. I didn’t want to go back home either to see my family acting exactly like the rest of the town. My gaze fell on the treeline leading into the forest. 

The ground was soft and a bit wet, despite the aforementioned lack of rain. I moved my feet quickly so my sneakers wouldn’t sink into the forest floor. Once I found a dryer spot I began to notice how tall all the trees were. Their crowns were so thick that they nearly blocked out the sun. As I continued walking, a familiar smell hit my nose. In the beginning it could almost be mistaken for the smell coming from the multiple bakeries. 

But as I walked it turned into the exact same one that had radiated from the soil in our garden. Only this time the putrid sweetness was much stronger and accompanied by a coppery stench like a slab of meat on the cusp of its expiration date. I felt nausea forming in my throat, but my curiosity made me power through it as I followed the smell until it overtook the air around me. 

The source of the smell was the biggest tree root I’d ever seen. The mere middle fragment of it sticking up from the ground was easily the size of a bus. It was in a tall arch. I looked around but saw no gigantic tree that the root could have belonged to. The sharp, saccharine smell was almost too much as I got as close as I could without hurling. The bark of the root was discolored and cracking, revealing a reddish gray wood underneath. 

I got close enough to reach out and place my palm on the root and my eyes went wide when I felt the slight give of the root’s surface. It was soft but ice cold and when I pulled my hand back I felt sticky sap coating my palm. I looked at my hand, the substance had a pink tint and a horrible smell. I quickly wiped it off on the denim of my shorts. I walked around the large, decaying root and looked at the crackling surface until I got to the other side. I didn’t know much about roots but I’m pretty sure what I saw couldn’t be explained by anyone. 

On the other side, the bark of the root seemed to be sliding off in a supple, wet mass. It barely clung onto an off-white, smooth branch. That wasn’t a branch. The bent look of the root was caused by two rounded ends coming together in a terrifyingly familiar way. I slowly looked down at my index finger and instinctively bent it into an arch, I held it up towards the root. I knew what it was, I knew what that sickeningly sweet smell was and I knew what Beraheim stood on.

Over the next week I snuck out at night to dig in the yard of another house with a ‘for sale’ sign. It didn't take me long because of the soft ground. My shovel finally hit a pipe yesterday, a rusted old pipe that ran down into a gray, leaking mass that stunk of what I found in the forest. It sat alongside numerous other water pipes coming from all directions. They were all buried in the surface of the mass, something protruded from under the surface of the mass, running along the length of it. My grip on the shovel tightened, causing the veins in my hands to pop out.

Like I said, finding a bus out of town is nearly impossible and I’m not even sure that’s what I want to do. My family is still here and I want to get them out too. I have no idea what to do now, I can’t look at my own fingers without my body tensing with stress. With every step I take, I think about what's lying and decaying just beneath the town. What I found in the forest was covered up by a heap of dirt when I went back. 

I’ve found other things too, a large hill on the other side of town with a sickly yellow wall-like structure protruding from the dirt. That was covered up shortly after. Every day, I think about the sweet taste of artificial cherries and the peace of mind it gave me back then. I want to feel like that again, I want to smile again. I want the stench of rotting flesh to disappear behind fresh-baked cake and prettily blooming flowers. I want to be able to enjoy spending time with my family again, even if they don’t act like my family anymore, even if they smile too wide and their teeth are too perfect. 

I want to feel at home.
