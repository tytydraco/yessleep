*“We can't do that, it'll be a sin”*



*The young petite girl looked shocked, her cherry lips apart and skirt just riding up above her knees as she knelt at the prayer bench. The red plush felt fabric contrasted pleasingly with her creamy white thighs.* 



*A man approached from behind where she was kneeling. Dressed in a black leather jacket and clothing, his form absorbed the flickering light of the candle. His rugged handsome features were cast in shadow. He leaned behind her, placing a large hand on her shoulder. “Is it truly a sin to be completely oneself, in front of God?” he spoke in her ear.* 



*She sighed and closed her eyes, her hand playing with the skirt of her clergy dress. He reached his arm around her throat, the silver fastenings of his jacket gleaming.* 

*“Let me fill your cup, and show God how devoted you can be” he spoke softly, twisting her around on the bench.* 



*Her back pressed against the reading shelf of the bench. She gasped as he pulled at her dull grey clergy dress, the loose soft fabric accentuating her breasts. Her hips arched as he pulled her dress upwards. Her chestnut brown eyes looked into his, and she smiled as she grabbed-*



I slammed the laptop shut and sighed. *Third one this month* I thought as I sat up from the bed and looked into my full length mirror. My blue eyes dully regarded me back. My tanned skin contrasted with my dirty blonde hair, and I was in decent shape. Yet moving for work had left my once slim athletic build much more comfortable in stature. I stood up and weaved around the detritus of books, clothes and food packets to grab a dressing gown and head downstairs. 



My open plan kitchen-living room was markedly tidier, but still showed tell-tale signs of a renter who'd moved a while ago but not settled. Cardboard boxes stood defiantly pressed against plain magnolia walls and utility bills littered the side boards. I turned on the kettle and practiced my breathing exercises. 



*I suppose it's not their fault* I thought as the kettle stirred to life. I always knew I had a very specific taste in porn ever since I broke up with my ex. Initially, free content online was able to satisfy me. But then the ED started. I thought that investing in custom adult content would solve the issue. The ability to find actors with similar eye colour and hair colour…but *she* wouldn't have smiled in that scenario. It wouldn't have been her reaction. 



A trilling ringing sound of the Discord ringtone competed with the kettle nearby. I sauntered away from the kettle back upstairs, to find Yan calling me. *Well at least he can hear the news fresh* I thought, walking over to the laptop. 



Yan was my contact for adult content, arranging work for actors and script writers whilst taking a handsome cut himself. I took a chance once by reaching out through a Twitter post. For the most part, most of the content he’d sent had worked. It was a successful professional relationship, for which I was happy to pay for. I wondered how he'd react to me potentially dropping him as a client…



I accepted the voice call. “Hey Yan, w-what's up?” I stuttered, slightly nervous.



“Oh you know me honey, busy as a bee” Yan drawled in a southern American accent. I knew Yan was Asian, American and a big deal in the adult industry but that was about it. 



“Just checking in to see if you liked that vid I’d sent a few weeks ago?”



“Yeah, about that it just- erm, didn't really work out as planned” I said, scratching my head embarrassed. “The actress smiled and one for the things I requested was that she not smile”



“Oh yeah that was the best take, rest of the footage she is very…neutral” Yan mused, “Did you watch the rest of it?”



“Didn't get that far, but listen I think-”



“Woah, wo wo look don't break up with me sweetie” Yan purred confidently. “Listen, I don't normally promote competition but I think Vince might actually have something good for you”



“Look, if I want blow-up dolls and glitchy AI chat bots, I'll click random links on porn sites mate” I retorted. 



I had initially tried one of Vince’s AI bots a few months ago fresh after my break up with Diana. After spewing random religious phrases at me and freezing, safe to say I didn't go to Vince again for pleasurable content. After joining the Adult Client Discord server, I learnt in voice channels Vince had a bit of a reputation as a peddler of unreliable erotic goods. 



“Listen, I'd be the first to yell that too, from the rooftops. But that slimy bitch has actually found something successful, that I'm recommending to certain clients” Yan reasoned. 



“What is it?”



“Apparently it's an in-person service” Yan cautiously proffered.



“Yan, you know how I feel about those” I sighed, running my hand through my hair and slumping. 



I had tried a few escorts, never to much success. They all whined and moaned in such a hollow way. It made me feel like I was starring in a porno against my will, with their cheap religious clothing but expensive premium make up. It made me feel used. 



“I shit you not, he's had a 100% satisfaction rate across 20 clients in 3 months. And most have had your…issue” Yan toned diplomatically. Part of Yan’s service demanded a questionnaire be filled out, so I knew he was talking about my ED.



“Why else are you promoting this, what's in it for you?” I quizzed.



“Most of my clients that had intimacy issues, are glowing now, Brandon. Like, they say they don't have the issues anymore. They say they've put themselves out there in the real world and more importantly, they still buy my service” Yan added smugly. “The way I see it is, whatever he's doing it isn't high throughput enough to threaten me *and* keeps my client base because they don't go off sex all together”



I huffed and pondered. I thought about what Yan had said. Even though this was a complete stranger on the internet, I trusted Yan’s opinion. As much as I could remember, he'd never really missed the mark. 



I sighed.



“Alright mate, how have you been? Feels like it's been ages!” Vince proclaimed merrily, chuckling slightly afterwards. 



*Yeah I wonder why?* I thought cynically, already regretting my decision. Vince's Essex accent reeked of a cheap salesperson. He felt like the very antithesis of Yan. 



“Yeah not bad, Yan said you have a new in-person service?” I queried directly, eager to accelerate the conversation towards its end. 



“Ahhh another referred client, I knew there'd be more” Vince huffed enthusiastically “So did Yan tell you much?”



“Just that it was an in-person service that was pretty good” I conceded “I’m willing to give it a go”



“Great, before we start I'll just need you to sign an electronic NDA I’m going to ping you now”



I was surprised. Vince had definitely gone up in the world if he was actually organised enough to construct an NDA for potential clients. 



“I'll let you scroll through, once I've received the confirmation I'll get into the details” Vince reeled off eagerly. 



I scrolled through the NDA. Nothing really seemed amiss. Price was high, but not really a concern for me. The banking firm paid me more than enough to write code and my outgoings were slim. Most of the classes were mostly just about not posting about “the service” on media or taking videos of the service. All pretty standard. I clicked the e-signature box and closed the tab. 



“Brilliant mate I've got that!” Vince said enthusiastically “so I'll get right into it. Desire-Me is a custom service which provides a unique custom experience for each pleasure seeker” droning slightly as it sounded like he was reading from a script.



“The box will arrive at the designated time and place. Sign for it, wheel it in and it'll be good to go when you open it. Put your hands on the figure inside-”



“Hold up, is this an android or something? Like what actually is it? I interrupted, skeptical.



“That's classified” Vince stated, oddly serious. “But it promises a truly unparalleled pleasure experience. Anyways, place your hands on the figure inside, and visualise your fantasy clearly” Vince explained. 



“Most feedback suggests that closing your eyes at this stage helps. Then it should be ready to go. After you're finished, lead the figure by hand to the box and it should place itself back inside-”



“Is that it?” I interjected.



“Yes I'm sorry I can't be more specific” Vince ventured pausing “But as you might've guessed from the NDA, it's pretty top level stuff mate”



My heart was pounding. A pure mix of nervous anxiety washed over me. I'd made decisions guided below my waist before and regretted it, like most. But this felt different. There was an imperceptible air of something serious, if even Vince was all business no jokes. *Fuck it* I thought. I wanted to get over Diana. I felt like a failure when my body betrayed me, making me nervous to even talk to new women. Yan seemed convinced this helped people similar to me too. It was surely worth a shot. 



“Okay, when can it be delivered?”



The box arrived the very next evening as intended. 



The courier wheeled what resembled a jet black coffin through my door into the living room. The wheels on the underside glided smoothly along the kitchen linoleum. The black case gleamed in the artificial kitchen light like beady eyes watching me. The courier dutifully propped up the case in my living room so it was standing at its full height. Standing amongst my basic renter's furniture, it dominated the room. A heavy-duty silver handle lock was situated on the right side of the box lid, similar to a walk-in freezer door. The rest of it was a featureless obsidian cuboid, concealing any indication as to what lay inside. The courier dutifully obtained a signature from me and left me alone with the box. 



*Well it's too late now* I thought, inspecting the box more closely. Apart from the silver handle and hinges, the box was completely featureless all around. I placed my ear next to the box, leaning my forearms and hands against the box. It felt surprisingly cool to the touch and seemed to be made of solid, marble-like stone. The material was so unyielding I could feel my own pulse, thumping through my hands. I could hear nothing inside the box. 



Stepping away from the box, I exhaled shakily. *I'm really doing this,* I thought, rubbing my hands on my jeans nervously. I collected my thoughts and went upstairs to prepare. I had no idea how the…figure inside would create my fantasy, so I'd been to the shops to buy supplies. I squatted at a cluster of paper bags in my room and brought out the innocuous items. A silver cross necklace. A leather-bound bible. A plain black clergy dress. I then fetched out the less innocent items from a plastic bag. Condoms, lubricant…I reached under my bed to grab some leather restraints and a flogger. *Fuck it,* *if I'm doing this I'm committing* I reasoned, convincing myself. I bundled it all together and took it downstairs.



The box was situated between the open-plan living room and kitchen area. Opposite was a basic brown kitchen table, with two chairs. I laid all of the items out on the table and pulled one of the chairs under the kitchen light. I closed the curtains to the kitchen and living room, and looked back at the box half expecting it to have moved. I exhaled deeply and took off my t-shirt and tossed it on the sofa nearby. I nervously removed my socks and jeans, fumbling with my zipper as my hands were shaking slightly. In my boxers, I approached the box. 



Grabbing the handle with both hands, I pulled it down towards me. The door opened. 



Cool air rushed out of the box, tinged with the scent of petrol. I could feel goosebumps immediately prickle my skin, as if my body was a conductor in a circuit. I stepped back from the box and gasped. 



And the Figure stepped forwards. The Figure was completely white, gleaming in the artificial kitchen light. Its featureless face seemed to simmer and morph, as if it were on a hob flame. Ruby lips surfaced from its face, pushing aside the whiteness as if its face were made of viscous honey. 



**Desire me** it spoke, the voice reverberating slightly, almost gurgling. 



Horrified, I watched my own hand stretch out to touch the figure on its right shoulder. It felt repulsive. The Figure's skin had little resistance and gave in to my touch like mud. Yet my hand felt like thousands of spiders were crawling across my palm, the back of my hand, my forearm. I shuddered and closed my eyes, attempting to imagine. Round pale breasts, chestnut eyes, small and petite…soft skin, luscious lips. I peeked and opened my eyes. 



The Figure was like a painting in progress. A single chestnut-coloured eye peered out from the white face. The ruby lips from before were fuller, plump with a slightly parted mouth. Perfect teeth inside emerged before my eyes, as it parted its mouth and moaned. My hand glided towards its waist, a petite midriff appearing under my hands. The Figure shrank before me, the hips underneath me turning to porcelain white skin. I could feel myself becoming hard, gazing at the transformation, trying to focus on its face-but suddenly catching a glimpse of a photo on the side of the kitchen. It was of Diana. 



*“Brandon I'm fed up with your LIES” screamed Diana, throwing my clothes at me and sobbing horrendously.* 



*“S-she kissed me and wanted me, would you have said no?” I protested weakly, stumbling as I hurriedly put clothes back on. “Why the fuck did you wait until just before sex you crazy bitch?”*



*“I knew you'd be more honest, you stupid boy” Diana yelled at me, tears running down her face. “I HATE you. The Lord sees all an-”*



*“I don't give a fuck about God. I thought it was hot based on what we used to do. That's why I tolerated it” I sneered. “Now you just use it like you use me, to do anything you want”*



*Diana trembled and closed her eyes. “Brandon, I hate you. I've never been led to think thoughts of violence before you. I hate you” Diana choked.* 



I cried and stepped back, pulling away from the Figure. I paused and looked up. Half of Diana’s face stared back at him, crying white pearl-coloured tears. The Figure's bare chest still remained and its porcelain midriff was paused, mid-brush stroke.The Figure's hands were Diana’s hands with long white solid nails. A beautiful leg stepped towards me, followed by a white unformed limb. 



“**Brandon** I hate y**ou”** it sobbed, edging closer. 



I bolted for the stairs, taking two at a time. In haste I missed a step, skipping and cracking my knee sharply on a step. I cried out twisting on my back. The Figure raced towards the stairs, clambering on all fours, moving for my throat with its teeth. I yelled and kicked at its legs, collapsing it on its front and sending it down the staircase. I turned and pushed up the stairs, my knee flaring in brilliant pain. Before I could reach the top, the Figure spoke “**You’ve led me to a path of temptation Brandon”**, clawed hands sinking into my back. 



“**F**ace respons**ibility”** the Figure sneered, raking its claws down my back. 



I cried, the shock bringing me to my knees. Sobbing, I pushed blindly upwards. The Figure, taken by surprise, fell back clutching the bannister before falling down the staircase. I took the chance. I pushed up and crawled into my room. I turned and slammed the door, frantically lying myself seated against it. 



Silence stole into the room, interrupted only by my own heart in my ears. 



I breathed raggedly as I slumped against the door. I could feel my back wet with blood, dripping onto my hands near my sides. I felt shame like stones in my chest, making it hard for me to breathe. I felt numb to what I’d just seen and felt a swell of embarrassment. *How could I be so weak, so stupid* I thought, tears blurring my vision. 



Footsteps interrupted my thoughts, making me hold my breath to listen. 



One. Two.



It seemed to be moving slowly, cautiously up the stairs. 



Three. Four. Five. Six. 



I could hear the Figure’s laboured breathing as the footsteps paused. It sounded wet and abhorrent, as if its mouth were filled with saliva as it rasped for air. 



Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.



The cacophony of breathing was horrendous, I wanted to cry out but I dared only to breathe. I wanted to grab something, to fend it off. Yet my legs felt like waves, nervous energy brimming inside them but powerless to move. How many stairs were on my staircase? 



A violent slam shook the door. I blurted out a cry in shock, my breathing fluttering in my mouth. I could feel pressure against the door. The sound of dragging reverberated through the door from the middle towards where my head was resting.



“Let me kill you, Brand**on”** it spoke calmly, eerily close to Diana’s voice. “You k**now** you deserve it for what you’ve done to me”



I rocked to my knees to propel myself towards the nearby desk chair, grabbing and twisting it to face the door. I expected it to break-in, but I could hear nothing. I shakily tip-toed towards the door and slotted the back of the chair underneath the handle. A red tongue protruded from under the door, long and meandering. It lazily scooped at the pool of blood by the door, accompanied by measured, wet slurping. I backed slowly away from the door.



“I’m sorry” I whimpered, my voice hoarse. 



“You taste good, Bra**ndon.** It’s a shame you s**inned**” it hissed, from the bottom of the doorframe. 



“I could be ch-anged” I croaked, scanning around his room frantically for something whilst trying to buy time. 



“What would it take f-for your forgiveness, for the Lord’s forgiveness?”



I spotted a set of cheap handcuffs poking out from underneath my bed, and leaned to grab them.



“You belong in hell” 



“But doesn’t everyone, anyone that’s sinned deserve a second chance at, at salvation?” I hurriedly spoke, inching towards the door. I slowly placed my hands on the chair. 



Quickly, I yanked back the chair and snatched the door handle. The door flew open to the Figure on its knees, its snarling mouth painted in blood. Before it could respond, I pushed the Figure with both hands and fell on top of it. Both my hands sunk into its shoulders, forcing me to look into the single chestnut eye on its face. The eye brimmed with white liquid, seeping like a pustulent wound. The Figure squirmed wildly underneath me, its teeth varnished in blood. 



I tightly shut my eyes and imagined. The sensation of insects scurrying along my hand and forearms made me want to be sick and cry out. It felt like they were inside me, burrowing, moving, incessant. I focussed on my heartbeat, reverberating in my ears. 



I thought of somebody submitting to me. Pale wrists, offering themselves solemnly as hard cuffs laced themselves over. Binding them, restraining them. Deep brown eyes turning toward me, pleading but knowing nothing can be done. I peeked at the Figure. 



The Figure had its eye closed meekly, its lips slightly parted. It sighed. The air which rushed from it was heavy with the scent of perfume mixed with petrol. The Figure crossed its arms slightly, impeded by my forearms which were still sunk into its shoulders. The movement undulated underneath my hands, pressing against the cheap handcuffs bunched in my right fist. I withdrew my hand, recovering the handcuffs. 



Although I was forming ideas, it was like trying to fill a cup that was already full. I deftly slipped one of the handcuffs over the Figure's wrists and pushed it towards the bannister, leaning over it. The hot breath emanating from it was irregular and frenzied. The Figure's facial expression was contorting and changing. It smiled, grimaced, moaned in my ear. I quickly latched the remaining cuff to the bannister, teetering uncomfortably on my knee near the top of the stairs. As I tried to pull away, I could feel its soft thighs clutch uncomfortably to my hips. I felt it locking me between its legs. Its other free hand slid up and down my crotch, feverishly gurgling and shaking. Desperate, I tried to find a memory. 



*“You want to use these on me?” Diana smirked, wrinkling her nose up at the cheap handcuffs.* 



*“I think it would help with, y'know” I proffered, stumbling over my words “My-”*



*“Are you not getting hard?” Diana interjected directly.* 



*I felt myself flush and looked at Diana. But I saw softness in her eyes, being direct was just her way of things. She laid a pale, small hand on my cheek.* 



*“Love, if this is something that'll help I'm here”* 



*“I don't want you to do it if you'll feel uncomfortable or weird though” I explained sheepishly, looking away. I felt her move closer to me on the bed. Her lavender perfume held me as she spoke in my ear.* 



*“I want to” she spoke, and paused. Her pauses really did send me through loops. It made me anxious and nervous, but also intoxicated me.*



*“But like any toy, if you want to use it on someone we need to use it on yo-”*



I frantically tried to think about something else. The Figure clamped its free hand on my left arm, the forearm still buried in the Figure’s shoulder. I wailed, frantically tugging at my arm. But I was locked in place, clamped by the Figure's strong porcelain-coloured thighs. 



“**Let me cuff** you Brandon” it gurgled desperately, wrenching its own arm. I could feel it strain underneath me, hearing it's arm go taut and start to rip. Horrified, I desperately smacked my head into the Figure and reeled backwards. Its grip completely slackened which sent me wheeling down the stairs. I heard a sickening crunch on my descent, unable to stop myself spinning down the stairwell. I tried to prop myself up at the bottom, but failed as my left arm wouldn't listen. I'd broken my left wrist on the fall, the sight of it stealing my breath. I didn't have time to think. The Figure moaned in caricature ecstasy, as a loud ripping and crunching reverberated down the stairs. 



It was coming for me and I had no way to escape. 



Sobbing, I weakly pushed away from the stairs with my legs. The Figure started to slowly descend the stairs. I scrambled quicker, reaching to the nearby sofa to heave myself to my feet. As I shoved myself upwards, my knees and back flared with pain. I felt hot blood run from my back in droplets as the Figure became visible. 



Diana's face stared at me as I looked numbly back. The Figure had no hair, its features were dotted with white thick liquid, coating its cheeks and body. Its patchwork body was convulsing lightly, translucent bone gleaming from the socket where its arm had been. 



I looked around for something, anything. It traversed the stairs slowly, cautiously. The smell of petrol was stronger, invading the room as if I were in a fuel station. I scanned the kitchen and saw the gas hob. The Figure started to run. I hobbled frantically towards the kitchen, but the Figure was much faster. I made it two steps before it was on me, its arm encircling my neck in a lock. I could feel the arm press into my face, the overwhelming sensation of insects scurrying across my cheeks. *I’m going to die* I thought, a tear pooling in my eye, unable to fall. 



*I’m going to die and I don’t want to die.*



The Figure shuddered in response, weakening its grip. *It heard me*. Like my fantasies, my memories. I thought about my favourite ice-cream flavour and how the floor here reminded me of my Dad’s garage. The Figure reverberated, staggering slightly. I just had to think about things, things it couldn’t translate into a desire. *The sky outside my childhood home*. *Toffee pudding*. The Figure convulsed, allowing me to shove my hands into the Figure and push. *Forest walks*. *Breaking my mom’s glassware as a child*. *Washing the sand from my skin after travelling in Egypt with my family*. The Figure was stumbling away repulsed, tumbling into the kitchen. The smell of fuel and the feeling of insects were overwhelming, but my thoughts were all-consuming. *Lemon ice lollies*. I slammed the Figure’s head on the hob. *Growing vegetables with his aunt.* I grabbed the cooker knob and clicked. *Firework displays at his old school.* The Figure was crying white as it writhed incessantly against my grip, the hob lighter clicking. *Going to church with Diana. Saying goodbye to Diana.* 



The flames consumed the Figure and burnt my hands, causing me to yelp and trip backwards. I fell back into the bottom of the kitchen wall, whilst the Figure was ablaze in front of me. My vision grew grey and black, the only source of anything I could see was the great beacon of light the Figure gave off. It screeched in agony as it backed away from the hob, pulsing in my receding vision like a signal flare. I slumped and thought it reminded me of the night sky, the light imbuing itself with the stars in my head as I lost consciousness and fell to the kitchen floor. 



I stretched my legs out on the balcony, feeling the warm night air soak my body. The tide foamed on the shore nearby, cyclically disturbing the moonlight which shone over the rest of the sea. Small pockets of light emanated from the other villas along the Gibraltar coastline, glowing gently against the tranquil dark of the evening. The pleasant rhythmic rushing sound coated my ears, allowing me to unwind and think. It had been a full year today since moving from the UK which had come around suddenly, leaving me in a strange, sad mood. I knew I should feel happy, my quality of life was much better here. Yet it was almost like I was mourning, despite my departure being entirely my own doing since that night.



The pay out from what had happened had been extraordinary and suspicious. I very much expected my life to be very much over after destroying Vince’s premium product. I even risked calling Vince from my parents house the very next day, where I was staying after the fire. Instead, Vince was incredibly apologetic and vague.



*“What do you mean by my compensation claim?” I queried.*



*“Well given the events of what happened, a claim with my supplier for Desire-Me was automatically set up. And I’ll be stepping down very soon so don’t look out for a call from me about it, yeah?” Vince said shakily. “Someone will be in touch to sort out everything with you mate, just stick to the NDA alright?”*



And like that, I never spoke to Vince again. I was video called by a suit from a company called Imagine which seemingly owned Desire-Me. He seemed to be at my every beck and call, he sorted out my rental property. I was offered a very sizable sum, given I would sign a further agreement to not speak about what had happened that night. To which I gladly accepted. 



I told my family I was moving for work, when in actuality I just put in a request to go fully remote. Most people in my team from the bank had already had such arrangements so my request was swiftly approved. I knew I’d always wanted to move abroad but didn’t have the courage to learn a new language, so I chose Gibraltar as I’d been as a child with my family. It would be my springboard to emerge from this rut I’d sunk into. Before my move, I’d discarded all things related to Diana. I looked on Discord and saw Yan had messaged but aired it. I was done with allowing the nostalgic haze of my ex permeate me. It was now or never.



“Y’know, the beach isn’t going to run away. Like, you don’t have to keep watch” Nadia purred. 



“Look, if I don’t keep watch all those bodybuilders from the beach might rise up and steal you away rather than just ogle you” I smiled, turning to face her in my chair. 



Her ivory skin glistened in the moonlight as she sauntered over to the sunlounger opposite me. The black beach dress she was wearing wavered and ushered in the scent of lavender perfume as she lay back. 



“Well, they can ogle all they want. I only want to bring *you* dessert at the end of the day” she spoke, brandishing two ice lollies. 



“Do lemon ice lollies count as a dessert?” I smirked.



“Hmph, rude” Nadia pouted, tossing her black hair carelessly over her shoulder, as she turned away. 



I grinned as I knelt next to the sunlounger, kissing her lightly on her thigh and taking an ice lolly. “And what would I have to do to earn forgiveness?” I pleaded, looking into her brown, chestnut-coloured eyes. 



“Just desire me”
