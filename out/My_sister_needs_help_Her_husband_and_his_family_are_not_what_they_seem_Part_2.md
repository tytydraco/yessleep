[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dxfrkd/my_sister_needs_help_her_husband_and_his_family/)

Nighttime. Fir trees spreading out to the sky. Branches like thorns, choking the moonlight. No stars. Just an endless spiral of trunks and leaves. The crunch of leaves underfoot. The squishiness of mud giving way to each panicked step. Finally, I ran. The path ribboning through the thick woods getting narrower, narrower. “Sally!” I called out. “Sally, wait up! Don’t go! Didn’t Mom and Dad tell you to stay put at the campsite?”

She giggled, but where she was I couldn’t tell. Her giggling grew fainter and fainter until–

“Dude, wake up! Wake up, Albert! You’re creeping us out!”

I sat up with a jolt. I had fallen asleep at the breakfast table. My housemates, Lydia and Tyler, were looking at me, concerned. “Have you been here all night?” Lydia asked, her eyebrow raised.

Lydia and Tyler have been my and Sally’s friends since our boarding school days. Not long after the car accident, our uncle immediately dumped us in boarding school and rarely visited us. I was twelve and Sally was eight. We were basically left to ourselves. Luckily, Lydia – who was in my grade – transferred to the boarding school that same year with her brother Tyler, who was in Sally’s grade. Since then, the four of us had been friends, partners-in-crime, college schoolmates, drinking buddies, apartment housemates, confidants, you name it. Basically, we’re a family.

There was nothing we kept from each other. Then Sally met Ruthven and slowly started drifting away from the rest of us.

I rubbed my eyes and reached for the mug of coffee Tyler had been handing me. “Thanks,” I said, after taking a gulp. “I just had a bad dream. Sally was missing.” I stopped. “That–that wasn’t a nightmare, was it?”

Lydia sighed. “I tried making a Missing poster. It got about ten reactions on Facebook before some idiot reported it as Spam. Then it got taken down.”

“Maybe it’s the bots,” Tyler said. “Or the Ruthvens.” He turned to me. “They can’t be that powerful, can they?”

I remembered the mysterious symbol on Sally’s cheek, and how the video refused to be uploaded no matter what I did. “That’s what I’m trying to figure out,” I said honestly. “I just want her back home safe.”

“We all do,” said Tyler. “Tell you what. Lydia and I are taking a break from work today. We’re going around town, and we’ll ask Sally’s old college friends and workmates if they know something. We found her old slam book in her closet. Not sure how updated it is, but it’s something.”

Trust Sally to keep little mementos like that, in the year of our Lord 2024, and my heart stung with a pang like no other. I missed her. “Thanks, guys,” I said politely. I didn’t have the heart to tell them that I had tried reaching out to Sally’s other friends, to little avail. Many of them hadn’t talked to her in over a year. They were just as clueless.

“Do you want to join us?” Lydia asked. 

“Actually,” I said, “there’s something I want to show you.” I whipped out my phone from my pocket and showed them the biggest clue I had so far – that strange video of Sally in the hotel hallway with wounds and a strange symbol carved on her cheek. After the video stopped, Lydia and Tyler shook their heads at the same time.

“Fuck him,” Lydia breathed out.

“I knew it,” Tyler said grimly. “Byron’s a psychopath. We better show this to the police!”

I hesitated. “What if they’re on the Ruthvens’ payroll?” I asked. “I mean, I’d like to try. I did try, but they were so unhelpful. I suggest we go to this address here first.” I showed them the second message.

“You be careful, Albert,” said Tyler. “We’re going against bigshot nutjobs here.”

“Are you with me or not?”

“We better stick together, the three of us,” Lydia said. “But we need to finish breakfast first.”

We all forced ourselves to eat. I could tell that none of us had the appetite. Lydia kept looking at her phone and shaking her head. Tyler seemed to be more distant, on the verge of tears. He was incredibly close to Sally since they were the same age, and shared the same interests in arts and lifestyle. I even wondered at times if he saw her as someone beyond a friend. Either way, in less than an hour, we were in Lydia’s Toyota, and she started driving to the pinned location.

“I’m going to take a video of our journey,” said Tyler. “Just in case. You never know.” Neither Lydia nor I protested.

The town in question was so old that the streets were narrow, and the buildings were mostly run-down, made of wood and bricks. Gone were the skyscrapers and high-end cars. Gone were the big malls and commercial establishments. Instead, we felt like we were transported through time. There were small storefronts with painted signs labeling wares; there were at least three churches; there were lots of shrubberies and patches of forestry. Houses soon became fewer and farther in between. Finally, we reached the neighborhood – after crossing two roads with no people or buildings in it. The pinned location was in a small suburbia-type of neighborhood that looked like it was stuck in the 1950s. The houses were cream white with picket fences and porches. The closer we got to the place, the more unstable our signal became. But we were really there.

“34 Sheridan Road,” repeated Tyler. “It’s that house.” He pointed to one of the picket-fence houses. I peered through the windows, which were covered with yellow-and-pink floral curtains. There were no shadows, no silhouettes moving inside. The house seemed to be empty.

“We have to go,” I said. “All three of us. Tyler, can you try hiding the camera somewhere?”

It took a while, but Tyler managed to hide his phone in the bag’s front pocket in such a way that the camera was parallel to a tiny gap between the end of the zipper and the pocket’s lining. We marched to the house. A few doors down, an old woman gardening her flowers stopped and frowned, looking at us. On the other side, two little boys paused in their game to watch us pass by. They looked old enough to be in school. I wondered why they weren’t.

I rang the doorbell. The door opened with a creak. A man, middle-aged with soft, pale features and really dark hair, squinted his eyes at us. He frowned. “Um, who are you and how may I help you?”

That stunned me. “Wait, so you weren’t the one who messaged me to come?”

“I have never met any of you before. Why would I message you?” The man crossed his arms. Then, behind him, came another voice. A woman’s. “What’s going on, Edward?” She appeared by his side. She looked similarly pale, with frizzy blonde hair and striking blue eyes. “Who are these people?” There was a hint of alarm in her voice.

I cleared my throat. “Um, I received—I received a message from an unknown number. It had your address in it. But listen, maybe you know something. You see–you see–”

“His sister is missing,” Lydia thankfully cut it straight to the point. “Her name is Sally Aubrey. Sally Aubrey-Ruthven, actually. We suspect her husband Byron had something to do with her disappearance.”

“Yes,” said Tyler. “That Byron Ruthven.”

Edward and his wife’s gazes widened. They turned to each other, and then at us. Then Edward hissed, “Come inside. Quick!” He led us in, glancing furtively at both sides before shutting the door.

It was a pristine, if not old-fashioned house, clean but nothing special. They led us to the living room, and made us sit on the couches. I peered around. There were family pictures everywhere. I counted the number of kids. Five. They must all be in school, or something. Oddly enough, there were no pictures of Edward or his wife in their youth or childhood years.

Edward assumed his seat on one of the couches. His wife sat beside him. They were quiet the entire time I played them the video.

“Well,” Edward said grimly, “your sister made the worst decision of her life marrying my brother.”

My jaw dropped.

“I was lucky,” said the wife. “I barely survived the Induction. I didn’t want to push through with the family tradition, and Edward respected that. But his family didn’t. They forced me to participate until the sixth carving. Then the marks disappeared from my body. And I had fully transformed.”

“Hold on!” I interrupted. “They did what?”

Edward paused. “Let me tell what I’m allowed to tell them, Mary,” he said to his wife. He looked at us. “We barely escaped, you know? I promised my brother that if he’d just let us go, start anew somewhere else and separate from the family, I would tell no one about what he did to Mary. I would never intervene with the curse.”

“What curse?” I said. “Is that the same curse my sister was talking about in the video?”

“Yes,” Edward said. “As much as I’d like to help you, your sister is already a lost cause. She already has a  carving on her cheek. You need six of those to please the Monolith and transform into one of the Ruthvens.”

“What the hell is a Monolith?” I asked.

“Hold on, so you’re saying…that Sally’s cursed?” Lydia said at the same time.

“Your sister being dead is the better option,” Edward just went on. “If she lives, she will suffer forever. She’ll never be free from her husband.” He sighed once more. “Once a Ruthven, always a Ruthven. In a way, my family and I are still part of the curse. We cannot tell anybody the entire truth.”

“Do you at least know which hotel this is from?”

Edward shook his head. “All of the Ruthven five-stars have the same furnishing. How should I know? I’m still part of the family by blood, but not by name. I displeased the Monolith by running away with Mary. They never talked to us since, thank goodness. But I did hear that they had to sacrifice another innocent to make up for what I did.”

“I don’t–I don’t get it.”

“His first wife,” said Mary. “Her name was Tessa Germaine. Poor soul. Her body was never found. But it’s better than craving blood for eternity. She was sacrificed eleven years ago, the same age her little girl probably is now.”

“Elizabeth,” I whispered aloud. “The stepdaughter Sally’s trying to protect.”

The lights flickered. Lydia clutched her brother’s arm. The picture frames started shaking on their own. Edward stood up. “You better go,” he insisted. “It worsens the more we talk about it.”

“But how about Sally?” I asked, even as he and his wife were leading us to the door. I don’t even know how we got to our feet. Lydia, Tyler, and I just seemed to be following them out of will.

Before the door shut on our faces, Edward said, “It started with the fires. When that didn’t work, they kidnapped women. When they started being found out, they used wives. I’m sorry. But at this point you’d better start praying your sister is dead.”

There was no choice but to go back to the car. “So, where next?” Lydia asked after a moment of silence. We were almost out of town. “The police? Sally’s friends?”

“I don’t trust the police at this point,” Tyler said, shaking his head. “Or anyone. We need it straight from Sally’s mouth.”

“So every Ruthven hotel in this country, huh?” Lydia asked. “Maybe start with the nearest ones? What do you think, Albert?”

I couldn’t answer. There was another video sent by the same anonymous Viber number. It was even longer than the first. My fingers trembled. I clicked play.

The same wallpaper, but with a different lighting. More shadows. There was a brown pillar with ornate carving beside my sister, who was in a crouched position, looking even more tired and sore. There was another identical carving on her left temple. She looked terrified and in pain. Was she under a table? Was she hiding from someone?

She adjusted the angle of the camera before it focused on her face. “They’re still looking for me,” she said, in a half-hiss, half-whisper. “They won’t stop until they’ve gotten what they wanted. Please, to anyone out there, do not make any deal, any form of agreement with my husband’s family. The Ruthvens are not what they seem. They have killed so many people throughout the centuries. They silently control everything in this country from hospitals to police stations. That is because they are dependent on blood. The more blood they consume, and the rarer that blood is, the more powerful they get. They source their power from a strange Monolith found in the basement of this hotel. It–”

The footage shook, becoming grainy for a moment before stabilizing again. All throughout, Sally was speaking. She was still talking when the video became clear once more. But I had missed several words.

“--whoever has Elizabeth, my stepdaughter, please take care of her. Tell her that I loved her and that I did my best. To her and her late mother, I am so, so sorry.”

I tried replaying the missing  part of the footage again and again, but I could not get any words from it. I wondered if using a special software can help me identify the missing words. Either way, I knew where to go next.

“We need to find Elizabeth,” I said. “The Ruthvens can’t be found, but Tessa Germaine’s family must be looking for her the way we are looking for Sally. They must have information on the little girl. That’s what we need to know next.”

“So, where exactly are we going to find that information?” Lydia asked.

“Sally’s favorite place,” I said. “The archives at the public library.”
