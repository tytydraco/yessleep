**Love was never meant for me.**

All I ever wanted in life was to be loved. Someone to confide in, to trust—someone to share my feelings with and find a sense of peace. That was all I asked of the world: the chance to have that. But life had other plans. I was dealt the wrong hand, and I’ve spent years trying to play it.  

I shouldn’t blame the world or other people. Most of my struggles came from my own self-sabotage. Reaching out felt like climbing a mountain, small talk like navigating a minefield. Conversations never lasted beyond the briefest of pleasantries. I’d freeze, my words drying up, and the moment would slip away.  

All I wanted in life was to be loved.  

And for a while, I thought I’d finally found it. But I left something behind over there—something I know I’ll never get back. And something else followed me home.  



—



It started with a trip to Europe. After five gruelling years of law school, l'd stumbled into a job at one of the most cutthroat corporate firms-the kind where the paycheques numbed the soul-crushing hours. Will, my best friend, had been there two years already, a golden boy with a knack for charming clients and a salary that funded his taste for single malts and bougie clubs. He took me under his wing, teaching me the unspoken rules of"real law": how to bill ruthlessly, schmooze judges, to understand and break the rules.

By the time we'd saved enough to fund this trip, we'd both become experts in burying ourselves in work...and little else. 

At the time, Europe sounded exciting. But as the departure date loomed, the idea of leaving home filled me with dread. I’d never been outside my hometown except for the occasional family event—and even those had stopped once I moved out.  

Will was different from me. He thrived on adventure, on new experiences. He had a charisma that drew people to him, a way of making even the most mundane conversations feel alive. I, on the other hand, was content to stay in the background, observing rather than participating.  

Somehow, we balanced each other out. I’d research the history and culture of a place, and he’d turn that knowledge into an unforgettable experience. It was a dynamic that worked, even if I often felt like the wet blanket of the pair.

We landed in London and spent weeks exploring the British Isles. We shared the driving and the costs, stayed in separate rooms whenever possible, and did practically everything together. Separate rooms were a necessity with Will—he had a knack for finding companionship wherever we went.  

I didn’t mind. He didn’t need my approval or encouragement. I was just happy for him. He tried to include me, of course, introducing me to women he thought I’d like. But every time, I’d freeze. The moment I opened my mouth, the conversation would fizzle out. ‘I’m good,’ I’d say, and that would be the end of it.  

I should have asked him to stop, but it made him happy to try. He always gave me the ‘first pass,’ as he called it, but they usually ended up with him. I didn’t mind. I was there to have a good time in my own way.  

After a heavy night of drinking, we made the flight over the channel and landed in the Netherlands. Once we were in our hotel sanctuary, Will suggested a detour. I was immediately suspicious. He’s always been spontaneous, but this felt different. There was a glint in his eye, a mischievousness that made me uneasy.  

By the time we found ourselves in Amsterdam’s Red Light District, it was too late to back out. The neon lights buzzed overhead, casting a garish glow over the narrow streets. Will was in his element, weaving through the crowd with effortless charm. I felt like an ice cube in a furnace.

I wanted to retreat to the safety of my hotel room, but Will wouldn’t let me. “No time like the present,” he cooed, slinging an arm around my shoulders in that familiar, reassuring gesture. “You just need a little confidence.”  

I cringed at the thought.  

The place was an assault on the senses. The bass from the music thrummed in my chest, each beat reverberating through my bones. The air was thick with the mingling scents of cologne, perfume, and the acrid tang of cigarettes and vape smoke. Sweat, alcohol, and something darker—something primal—hung in the air. The streets pulsed with life: tourists and locals, customers and vendors, all moving in a chaotic rhythm. And then there were the others—the men and women in the windows, their expressions calculating, their presence both alluring and unsettling.  

I wanted to run, to hide. This was too much for me. I turned to Will, my voice trembling. “We shouldn’t—”  

Will grinned, his arm still draped around me, and gestured with an open hand as if presenting an exhibit of carnal desires. “Take your pick,” he said, his tone light but insistent. “I’ll cover the cost.”  

“Will, I… I can’t.”  

“That’s not what you said last night.”  

My stomach churned. The night before reaching Amsterdam was hazy, blurred at the edges. But the throbbing, sickening ache in my head the next morning was all too clear.  

Will steered me further down the street, his grip firm but friendly. “You said it yourself—you just need to get your ‘cherry popped,’ and you’d get that little boost you’ve always needed.” He smiled, his eyes gleaming with mischief. “And I, for one, agree wholeheartedly. So here we are.”  

The protest died on my lips. He was right. He was always right. I’d never taken the steps others seemed to manage so effortlessly. All I wanted was a way forward, and here was my best friend, offering me exactly that.  

I hesitated, then finally smiled. The buzzing lights no longer felt oppressive; instead, they seemed to pulse with possibility. The assaulting scents faded into the background, replaced by a strange, newfound clarity. I took it all in once more, my resolve hardening.  

I let myself get swept up in the illusion. The women’s calculating stares lingered on me—cold, appraising—but I forced myself to believe they were glances of desire. Deep down, I knew it was transactional. They didn’t want me. But in that moment, I let myself pretend. I smothered the warning voice in my head and leaned into the heat rising in my chest, the liquid fire in my veins. The music, the smells, the dizzying lights—they all blurred into a single, intoxicating hum. For once, I didn’t fight the hunger I’d always buried.  

It felt… good.  

Then Will’s arm slipped off my shoulders, and reality crashed back in. My safety net was gone. I turned to see him already deep in conversation with a woman leaning in a doorway. She was striking, dressed in shimmering, barely-there clothing that glinted under the neon. My face burned at the brazenness of it all, but Will looked perfectly at ease, spinning some charming story as she bit her lip and laughed.  

Before I could protest, she tugged him towards a dimly lit doorway. He flashed me a grin over his shoulder, pressed a wad of notes into my hand, and mouthed, “On me.” Then he vanished inside, leaving me alone.  

The street was once again too bright, too loud. Beautiful bodies brushed past me, laughing, flirting, living. I stood frozen, the crumpled cash damp in my palm, feeling like a troll dragged blinking into daylight—ugly, out of place, and painfully seen.  

I began to wander the district, unmoored but oddly expectant. The loss of Will’s presence gnawed at me, yet curiosity bloomed in its place—a slow, creeping thing. The women in the windows watched me pass, their offers sharp and transactional, but I shook my head politely each time. I let myself stare though, feeding that fragile ember of excitement. When I lingered too long outside a bar or club, I forced myself onward. A rhythm took hold: walk, pause, observe, catalogue, repeat. Step by step, the district’s chaos began to feel almost… hypnotic.

Time blurred. Will’s absence should have worried me, but the rhythm numbed it. My earlier dread dissolved into complacency, as if the neon-lit streets had cast a spell. I wove through crowds with murmured apologies, my feet carrying me deeper into the labyrinth, until I stumbled upon a narrow alleyway at the district’s edge.  

And there she was.  

The most striking woman I’d ever seen.  

She stood tall—nearly six feet, just inches shorter than me—her posture poised and effortlessly elegant. Her jet-black hair was swept into an intricate pattern, strands catching the amber glow of the streetlights like threads of silk. Her face was a masterpiece: full lips painted a decadent red, cheekbones sculpted as if from marble, and eyes so dark they seemed to swallow the light around them. Her dress was simpler than the others-a sleek, plunging gown of midnight velvet that clung to her curves, shimmering faintly as she shifted, like starlight caught in ink.  

When our eyes met, hers softened. Not with pity, but with a warmth that felt exclusive, as if she’d been waiting for me alone.  

I drifted towards her, my senses flooding. Her perfume was intoxicating—jasmine and vanilla, spiced with something darker, richer, like aged cognac. It wrapped around me, warm and heavy, as she tilted her head in invitation. Her breath hitched, just slightly, as I stepped closer, and I caught the faintest flush on her collarbone. The fabric of her dress whispered against her skin as she shifted her weight, her hips curving in a way that felt both accidental and deliberate.  

“Hello,” I said, the word trembling.  

Her smile bloomed, bright and disarming. “A pleasure to meet you, Lieverd,” she purred, her Dutch accent softening the edges of her words into silk. She took my hand, her touch startlingly warm, and brushed her thumb over my knuckles. “I am Sable. And who has wandered into my little corner of the night?”  

“Sam,” I breathed.  

“Sam,” she repeated, my name a caress on her tongue. Her fingers circled my palm, slow and deliberate. “And what brings you to my doorstep, hm? The street is full of beautiful distractions tonight.”  

My throat tightened, but not from fear—from a rush of adrenaline, of possibility. “None of them… none of them are you madame.”  

Her laugh was low, musical. “Flatterer.” She leaned in, her scent deepening, and for a heartbeat, her lips grazed my ear. “Call me Sable. No need for madame—unless you’d like me to play the role?”  

I flushed, stammering an apology, but she squeezed my hand, anchoring me.  

“Don’t fret, Sam. Shyness is… refreshing.” Her gaze dropped to my lips, then back up, holding mine. “Tell me—are you looking for company tonight?”  

I nodded, wordless.  

“Good.” Her fingers laced with mine, tugging me gently towards the arched doorway behind her.

The club’s interior unfolded like a forgotten parlour from another century—opulent drapes, gilded mirrors tarnished with age, and the faintest trace of candle wax lingering in the air. Her heels clicked rhythmically against the wooden floor, each tap a metronome counting down to the fantasy I’d conjured in a thousand lonely nights. She glanced back, her smile a promise, and in that moment, I’d have followed her into hell itself.  

The clamour of the Red Light District dissolved as the door sealed behind us. My eyes clung to her—the sway of her hips, the way her gown caught the candlelight like liquid shadow. The room was small, intimate, dominated by a four-poster bed draped in burgundy silk. She turned the key in the lock with a soft click and my pulse thrummed in my ears.  

She sat me at the edge of the bed and knelt before me, her hand brushing my knee. “I can feel your desire, Lieverd,” she murmured, her voice a sweet caress. “But before I grant you the pleasure you seek, I must be certain you’re worthy of it. Can you afford to taste what I have to offer?”  

I fumbled for the cash Will had given me. My pockets were empty. Panic surged. “I—I don’t have it. I think… someone took it—”  

I looked down, shame burning through me like a fever. My legs twitched, desperate to bolt, to escape this folly. “I… I have to go. I’m sorry.”  

Her finger grazed my lips, silencing me. “Oh, Sam,” she murmured, her voice a velvet balm. “I know this is new for you. But I’m here to guide you. To ease you.”  

Her gaze held mine, steady and unflinching. There was no anger, no impatience—only a quiet, aching sympathy. She *saw* me. Saw the panic clawing at my chest, the fear tightening my throat. And she didn’t recoil. She understood.  

At that moment, I felt something I hadn’t in years: seen. Not judged. Not pitied. Just… seen. It was as if she’d peeled back every layer of my awkwardness, my self-doubt, and found something worth holding onto.  

Her hand lingered on my shoulder as she rose, her touch warm and grounding. “Lie down,” she said softly.  

I obeyed.  

She drifted to a mahogany cabinet, lighting candles as she went. The first flame caught the jasmine incense she’d set alight—thick, honeyed smoke pooling in the air. “You’re searching for something **Lieverd**,” she said, more to herself than me. From the cabinet, she withdrew a small carved box, its wood blackened with age. “Something *more* than this.”  

The lid creaked open. Inside lay a bronze bowl, its edges etched with symbols I couldn’t decipher, and a slender mallet. She placed the bowl beside the bed, the metal glinting dully. “Breathe deep.”  

I inhaled—jasmine, vanilla, the musk of her perfume—as she struck the bowl. A low, resonant hum flooded the room, vibrating in my ribs, my teeth. The sound coiled around me, pulling me deeper into the mattress.  

“Let it *take* you,” she whispered. Another strike, the tone sharper now. My limbs turned liquid, my thoughts syrupy. The candles blurred into halos, her silhouette a dark smudge against the gold.  

“Good,” she purred. A cool palm pressed to my forehead. “Now. Just let go.”  

The last thing I remember is her smile—tender, almost maternal—as the world dissolved into warmth. 



—



I awoke in my hotel bed, the sheets tangled around me. My head felt light, as if a vice I hadn’t noticed had finally loosened its grip. Exhilaration buzzed under my skin, electric and unfamiliar. Memories of the night before flooded back—soft whispers, the warmth of her body against mine, the way her hands had traced patterns I’d only dreamed of. Passion. Pleasure. Connection.  

Is this what it feels like?  

I fell back onto the pillows, a grin spreading across my face. For the first time in years, I felt… whole. The world seemed brighter, sharper, as if I’d been living in black and white until now.  

My phone buzzed on the nightstand. A single message from an unknown number:  



**“I hope you had a wonderful time, Lieverd.”**



My chest tightened. I wanted to reply, to thank her, to ask if I’d see her again—but I stopped myself. This wasn’t about her. Not really. Sable had been the spark, but the fire was mine. For the first time, I felt a flicker of confidence, a lightness in my step. She’d given me a glimpse of what I could be, and I wasn’t going to let that slip away.  

I wish I could have held onto that feeling, bottled it like a rare perfume. I wish I could have kept it close, a talisman against the grey monotony of my old life. But the light she’d ignited never burned as brightly ever again.  



—



The conversation with Will was a blur of backslaps and crude jokes. He congratulated me in that blokish way of his, grinning like we’d just won a bet. “Soon you’ll be pullin’ as much as me!” he crowed, jabbing my ribs. I cringed at his theatrics but let him revel in it. I spared him the details—to his disappointment—but he could tell I’d changed. My silence felt lighter, my posture less hunched.  

We were supposed to leave Amsterdam the next day, diving back into castles and museums. But the thought of it left me uneasy. I told myself it was just a break in our rhythm, but when I tried to replan our route, my fingers froze over the map. In the end, I surprised us both.  

“Let’s stay a few more days,” I said.  

Will blinked. “You want to stay?” He shrugged. “I’m down. There’s still cafés. Hookah bars. Plenty to see.”  

The words slipped out before I could stop them. “Or we could hit the Red Light again?”  

Will laughed, grabbing my head in a playful headlock. “Christ. You’re pussy-drunk, aren’t ya?”  

I flushed but didn’t deny it.  

He shrugged. “Look, there’s cheaper ways to get laid, but if you need the confidence boost…”  

“I’ll pay this time,” I said, sharper than I meant to. The truth about the stolen cash hovered on my tongue, but I swallowed it.  

Will studied me, then smirked. “All good, we’re here for fun.”  



—



That night, the district felt different. At first, I revelled in it—the garish neon, the bass thudding through the cobbles, the way the fog clung to the streetlamps like smoke. I let myself be swept up again, chasing that fleeting high. For a moment, it worked: the lights blurred into a kaleidoscope, the laughter of strangers fizzed like champagne in my veins, and I thought, ‘This is it. This is living.’ 

I let Will go on his merry way, slipping into the bright street alone. The air hummed with possibility, the pavement slick with rain and neon. I’m ready, I told myself, feigning confidence. But then, slowly, the cracks began to show.  

The music grew tinny, the neon too harsh—like stage lights peeling back a facade. The women and men in the windows still smiled, but their eyes glazed over me, their pitches rehearsed and hollow. One woman winked, her red lips curving into a perfect crescent, but it didn’t reach her eyes. Another man leaned against his doorway, muscles flexed, but his stare drifted past me to the next potential customer.  

My earlier excitement curdled. The district wasn’t alive—it was a machine, grinding through the same motions night after night. The smells turned cloying: stale beer, cheap perfume, sweat. Even the air felt thicker, pressing down on my chest.  

I tried to force it. I Lingered outside a club where a brunette in a sequined dress beckoned. Her laugh was too loud, her touch on my arm too practiced. “Come inside, handsome,” she purred, but the words rang flat.  

I pulled away, muttering an apology, and stumbled back into the street. The crowd jostled me, their voices sharp and grating. A tourist spilled his pint, the beer foaming over my shoes. Someone shoved past, yelling into their phone.  

First, the district had felt like an assault—neon claws raking my eyes, bass throbbing like a migraine, strangers’ laughter sharp as broken glass. I’d recoiled from its chaos, drowning in sensory noise.  

I then thought I understood this place. The garish lights became a beacon, the crowds a pulse I could ride. I’d returned chasing that high, convinced I could master the chaos, make it mine.  

Now? The illusion crumbled. The district wasn’t alive—it was a facsimile, a wind-up toy spinning in decay. The women’s smiles were chipped veneers, the men’s banter scripted and stale. Even the air reeked of desperation, cheap perfume masking rot. That "magic" I’d felt? It had never been here. 

It wasn’t like her.

My throat tightened. I fumbled for my phone, the screen glaring in the dark. Before I could second-guess myself, I typed:  

**“Are you there?”**



The reply came seconds later, as if she’d been waiting:  

**“You know where to find me.”**



I pushed through the crowd, shoulders hunched against the predatory stares, the hissed offers, the grasping hands. I was no longer prey—I had a purpose. When I broke free of the throng, she stood there, waiting.  

Sable.  

The sight of her hit me like a drug. The world sharpened, the noise dimmed, and everything clicked into place. She wore a gown of black lace, the fabric clinging to her curves, the neckline plunging to reveal the soft swell of her chest. Rain glinted in her hair, slicking it to her shoulders like ink. Her smile was a siren’s call.  

“Sam,” she breathed, and my knees buckled.  

I stumbled towards her, drunk on the sound of my own name. She turned, leading me inside without a word.  

The room was unchanged—candles flickering, jasmine incense thickening the air. I stared at the bed, my throat dry, pulse roaring. Behind me, the lock clicked.

“You’ve returned, Sam,” she said, her voice a purr. “But you know I can’t repeat our… arrangement without payment.”  

“I’ll pay!” I blurted, fumbling for my travel card. “For last night. For tonight.”  

Her gloved hand slid down my arm, warm even through the silk. She plucked the card from my trembling fingers. “Good, **Lieverd**.”  

The endearment liquefied me. I swayed, heat pooling in my chest.  

She pulled out the carved bowl once again and struck it, the tone reverberating the room and into me. I quivered at the sensation as she approached me again.

She cupped the back of my neck, her grip firm. “*Breathe*,” she commanded.  

I obeyed, inhaling jasmine, vanilla, her.

“Now,” she whispered, lips grazing my ear. “*Taste* me.”  

I fell into her, and the world dissolved.  



—



I awoke in my bed yet again. A swell of pride filled the hollow where Sable had drunk her fill. My body hummed with the ghost of her touch, every nerve still singing. The memories of the night swirled—slippery, fragmented. A gasp. A shudder. A moan. But when I tried to grasp them, they dissolved like smoke, leaving only her face: Sable, fully clothed, those red lips curved in a smile. Her voice lingered, a phantom whisper: ‘Think of me.’

And I did. 

But as the morning wore on, the glow faded. The memories felt like a dream half-remembered—edges blurred, colours bleached. The fuzzy blurring bled into my vision, the colours of the hotel room fainter than before. 



—



Will cornered me over my morning coffee, his brow furrowed. “You plotted the next stop yet?”  

“Not yet,” I said, too quickly. “We’ve only just arrived.”  

“Sam. We’ve been here five days.”  

The words landed like a punch. **Five days**? I’d have sworn it was two. Three, at most. My hands tightened around my mug. “That can’t be right.”  

Will’s laugh was brittle. “You serious? Did you smoke half of Amsterdam? I told you not to smoke too much.” His smile faltered at my silence. “You good Sam?”  

Smoke? The dread pooled in my gut, like ice-water trickling down my spine. But I forced a grin. “Midday. We’ll leave by midday.”  

He hesitated, then clapped my shoulder. “You tell me if… y’know. If anything’s off.”  

“Nothing’s off.”  

But as he left, the lie curdled. I pulled out my phone, thumb hovering over Sable’s number. The last message glared up at me:  

**“You know where to find me.”**



Outside, the rain began to fall—soft, relentless—and with it, the faintest whisper of jasmine lingered in the air.

I almost heard a whisper from the pattering on the window. “*Hello, Lievard*.” 



—



I picked a destination at random, my thoughts syrupy and scattered. We packed haphazardly, then hauled our bags down to reception. The female concierge—bright-eyed, polished—smiled as we stepped off the lift. “Checking out?”  

Will leaned on the counter, launching into his usual flirtations. His voice grated—teeth clicking, lips smacking—like nails on a chalkboard. I clenched my jaw, fighting the urge to snap.  

“Will that be card or cash today, sir?” The concierge was staring at me, her smile strained.  

“Hm?”

“Cash or card?” She asked again.

I blinked, swearing that Will and her were mid conversation.

“Card.”  I mumbled in feign confidence.

I fumbled with my wallet, fingers trembling. My travel card felt heavier than usual. I tapped it against the machine, typed my PIN.  

\**Declined*.\*  

“Wrong account,” I muttered, I tried again.  

\**Declined*.\*  

“Perhaps another card?” she suggested, too politely.  

Will shouldered me aside. “Let me.” He slapped down his card.  

\**Approved*.\*  

The machine chirped cheerfully.  

“Enjoy the rest of your trip!”  



—



In the lift, Will eyed me. “Your account empty or somethin’?”  

“No. You didn’t need to do that. I had it.”

“Sam—”  

“I’ll pay you back!” The words came out shrill, echoing off the mirrored walls.  

Will raised his hands. “Alright. Chill.”  

The doors opened to the garage. Will dragged his suitcase out, the wheels screeching. I braced myself against the lift frame, my head swimming. The air smelled faintly of jasmine—or was it petrol? My knees buckled, but I caught myself, nails digging into the metal door.

By the time I reached the car, my shirt clung to me with a strange cold sweat. We drove out of Amsterdam in silence.



—



The drive was uneventful. Will tried to lighten the mood with his usual banter, but my responses were clipped, distant. He sensed the tension but didn’t press—just filled the silence with jokes and anecdotes. I let him talk, my mind elsewhere. Five days in Amsterdam. The thought gnawed at me. What had I done?  

When I finally asked Will, careful to keep my tone casual, he shrugged. “You seemed… different. Like you’d found your stride. You went out on your own, came back late. Honestly, I was proud of you. Breaking out of your shell and all that.”  

But there was a flicker of concern in his eyes.  

Later, I checked my travel account. The card had been locked—flagged for suspicious activity. My stomach dropped, but relief followed when I saw the balance. The funds were lower than I’d expected, but not drained.  

Then I scrolled through the transactions.  

Ten charges, all around €400. One double charge of €800. No meals, no souvenirs, no museums. Just a single, repeated payment to an unnamed account.  

I told Will about the discrepancy. “The bank flagged it as fraud. Must’ve been an online scam.”  

He frowned. “You sure? Wasn’t all that good ass you were probably buying?”

I suppressed an angry response.

“It’s fine,” I lied, avoiding his gaze. “They’ve unlocked the card now.”  

He didn’t push, but I caught the doubt in his silence.  I punctuated the end of the conversation with a notification that I transferred the funds for the hotel.

As we left Amsterdam behind, the landscape blurred into a monotony of lakes and canals. The beauty felt hollow, like a postcard I’d seen too many times. I reached for my phone, thumb hovering over the messenger app almost instinctively. My heart stuttered when I saw the unknown number.  

I typed:  

**“Hey.”**



The cursor blinked, mocking my hesitation. I added:  

**“How much did I spend with you?**”



The reply came faster than I expected.  

**“You certainly liked my company. It was quite a number of times.”**



I frowned.  

**“My memory is hazy. Did we do any drugs?”**



**“We did not. I only did as you purchased. I made you relaxed.”**



**“Then why is it so hard to remember?”**



**“My methods are… unique.”**



I stared at the screen, my mind racing. What had she done to me? I tried to claw back the memories—fragments of candlelight, her voice, her touch—but they slipped through my fingers like smoke.  

A tone suddenly rattled through me, vibrating deep in my chest, a pleasant hum that left my limbs heavy and my mind adrift. The scent of jasmine and vanilla flooded my senses, pulling me into a haze of elation. I blinked, disoriented, as the world sharpened back into focus. Will had stopped at a petrol station to fill up. I must’ve fallen asleep.  

I checked my phone. Another message waited.  



**“*****Lieverd*****, I help people unwind. Guide them into a state where their thoughts quiet, their bodies listen. It’s all about letting go, surrendering to what they truly need.”**



My stomach twisted. Below her message, a reply I didn’t remember sending:  

**“I see.”**



The conversation continued:  

**“If you’ve been dissatisfied with our sessions, I offer a partial refund. If you truly want it,Lieverd.”**



Another unrecognised reply:

**“No, it’s okay. Thank you, Sable.”**



**“Thank you,** ***Lievard*****.”**



The panic that had gripped me moments ago melted away. That name-*Lievard*\-sent a shiver of warmth through me. I couldn’t help but smile, my earlier fears suddenly forgotten.  

The car door swung open, jolting me from my thoughts. Will slid into the driver’s seat, tossing a bag of crisps into my lap. “Ready to go, sleepyhead?”  

I looked outside and saw Will had definitely finished fuelling up. I nodded and laid back in my seat, suddenly desperate for the sense of calm I just lost.



—



I lay awake in my hotel room, staring at the ceiling, the dim glow of the bedside lamp casting restless shadows along the walls. Through the thin partition, I heard it again—a soft, breathy sound of pleasure. Will’s room. Another conquest. Another night of indulgence.

I exhaled sharply and rolled over, seeking some refuge from the indecency unfolding just a few feet away. But there was no escape—not from the sounds, not from the thoughts creeping in at the edges of my mind. I reached for the pillow, pressing it over my ears, but it did little to drown out the reminder of what I was missing. Or worse, what I wanted.

A thought tickled the edges of my mind. Just one simple message—that’s all it would take.

No. She wouldn’t do that. She was busy with other clients.

I tried to shut out the voice urging me to try, to give in.

But before I could silence the impulse, my phone was already in my hand, a message sent.

**“Hey, I know it’s late and you’re probably busy, but can we talk?”**



I waited, shaking my head at the stupidity of it.

Then—message read. My body tensed.

The typing bubbles began to bounce. My grip tightened around the phone as if it were a lifeline.

Her reply came.

**“What is it,** ***Lieverd*****?”**



My pulse quickened. **“I know it’s stupid, but… can you send me a photo of your beautiful face? Just so I can remember you?”**



Message read. The knot in my stomach pulled tighter.

A long, agonising pause. My leg twitched, restless.

The bubbles danced again. I held my breath.

And then, there she was.

Her sculpted face filled the black void of my phone, framed by waves of perfect hair. Her narrow eyes, dark with unspoken promises, seemed to draw me in, daring me to press my lips against hers. Her mouth hung open slightly, teeth grazing her lower lip, leaving the faintest imprint of pleasure.

Slowly, my eyes drifted downward.

The gentle rise of her chest, the soft swell of flesh teased by the low-cut dress. Shadows played across her skin, hinting at what lay just beyond sight—just out of reach.

My excitement grew.

**“Beautiful as ever, Sable. But… I’m lonely tonight. Can I see more?”**



The wait was longer this time, time itself stretching, taunting me. I stared at the blinking cursor, anticipation curling around my ribs.

Had I been too bold? Did I sound desperate? Was I just a creep?

The thoughts piled on themselves, turning excitement into gnawing anxiety. The knot twisted tighter, my breath coming in shallow gasps.

Then—her reply.

A link.

**PayPal.**



**“I only ask for a small donation, Lieverd. Then you may see what you desire.”**



My mind wrestled with the implications, the unspoken transaction. But as I read her message again, the fear, the doubt—all of it melted away. A slow, familiar exhilaration replaced it, spreading like warmth through my veins.



**“Must I? I only ask for one picture.”**



**“If you truly desire it. Yes.”**



A new image appeared.

Statuesque beauty.

The scandalous curve of her dress hugging every perfect line, her body pressed into pleasing shapes, the soft swell of her flesh offering silent invitation. One hand rested just below the fabric’s edge, suggestive—an unopened door to something forbidden.

My breath caught. My lips parted unconsciously.

I scrolled up. My thumb hovered over the link.

And I clicked.



—



I woke at dawn, tangled in sweat-damp sheets, my clothes strewn like roadkill across the floor. The air was thick with the scent of shame and stale arousal.

But as I dressed, hands trembling, I couldn’t suppress the grin.

The memory of her photos burned brighter than reason.

I scrolled back through the messages. A blur of text filled my vision—lines and lines of words I didn’t remember writing. My pulse quickened as I searched for what truly mattered. The images. The proof. The treasures I had been given.

But they were gone.

Nowhere in the wall of text.

Panic crept in. I switched to my photos, my fingers unsteady. Nothing. No trace of her, except for a single picture—her face, smiling, serene.

No. That wasn’t right. I had them. I *saw* them.

I flipped back to the messages, my desperation mounting. Had she deleted them? Had I? Was this some kind of mistake?

I scrolled faster, my breath quick and shallow, the vivid memory of her body already slipping away. The warmth, the shape of her, the invitation in her pose—it was dissolving, like a dream upon waking. The more I tried to grasp it, the more it faded, crumbling to dust in my mind.

Then, at the very top of the screen, I froze.

The unknown number had a name now.



**Your Love—Sable.**



I stared at it, my skin crawling with something nameless before forming into a loving caress. I wanted to type, to beg for the pictures back, to ask her what was happening. My thumbs hovered over the keyboard, but my breath hitched as my eyes caught her final message.



**“Sleep well,** ***Lieverd*****.”**



A smile consumed me, I drifted into the feeling.

“Hey!”

Will’s voice yanked me back into the present, and I gasped, blinking hard. The phone screen blurred before me. My grip was slick with sweat.

*What?*

The thought hit like a slap. I wasn’t in my hotel room. I was in a car.

Will was staring at me, frowning. “Yes?” I managed, my voice hoarse.

“Am I turning here or not?”

“Turning…?” The word barely made sense.

“Yeah, navigator,” he said, impatient. “What’s the map say?”

I stared out the window, my stomach twisting. The road stretched ahead into the unknown, endless and empty. The buildings were unfamiliar. The street signs meant nothing.

I didn’t know where we were.

I didn’t know how I got here.

The panic gripped me, cold and merciless. I swallowed hard, forcing out an answer.

“Left.”

Will nodded, flicking on the indicator. “Alright then.”

The car turned.

And I had no idea where we were going.
