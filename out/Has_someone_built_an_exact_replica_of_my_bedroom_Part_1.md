I’m not what you'd call a morning person. If my alarm doesn’t pry me out of bed, nothing will. So when I woke up in the pitch dark feeling refreshed and jaunty, I could already tell something was off. I scowled and fumbled around for the bedside lamp until I found the switch.

Grunting like a man twice my age, I sat up and reached for my phone on the nightstand, tapping it awake. 11:47 am. I stared blankly at the screen, then over at the drawn curtains, as if they might offer an explanation.

My eyes went wide. Oh no. I was supposed to have my ass at the office by 8:30, and my manager had been more than happy to unleash hell on me the one time I’d been twenty minutes late.

And yet it was still dark.

I climbed out of bed and lumbered to the window, dragging the curtains aside. A perfectly straightforward reason presented itself at once. Even so, I had to resist the urge to pinch myself awake.

Right behind the windowpane, pressed flush against the frame, was a red-brown brick wall, held together by crumbling lime mortar.

I forced myself out of my stupor and pulled the window open. As if on autopilot, my hand drifted toward the wall. I winced when my palm made contact, half expecting it to pass right through or disintegrate or some other nonsense, but the bricks felt cool and rough and rigid, as bricks do. Nothing remarkable about the wall, aside from the small fact that it hadn’t been there last night. I stroked it awkwardly like a peculiar pet, hammered at it with my fist and gave it a few good shoves. You can imagine how much good that did.

I live by myself in a small flat on the eighth floor of a massive apartment complex. It clings to the street alongside a row of its carbon copies, like a line of hideous dominoes. The view from my bedroom window used to offer little more than the front of the next building down the road. Leaning out far enough, I could have just made out an ill-kept yard with an overgrown sandbox no kid ever played in. The point of my rambling being, I suppose, that even if I did entertain the batshit idea that some pranksters pulled off a cloak-and-dagger window-walling operation—how the fuck did they manage it this high up?

Struggling to come up with a logical explanation that didn’t involve being stuck in an exceptionally realistic dream, I spun around and crossed the room to the only door out. When I got there, arm half-raised, my resolve faltered as quickly as it had appeared.

What if I found another brick wall? The first one was bonkers enough—who’s to say there couldn’t be a matching set? I’d be trapped in my own bedroom with no means to leave. And with no means to leave, food and drink would become a concern. There was nothing to eat in here. Just a six pack of one-litre water bottles by the bed, two already empty. That wouldn’t last long.

Dread was rising now, cold sweat already forming on my skin. Refusing to let it take over, I grabbed the doorknob and yanked the door open.

I’d worked myself up so bad there was no doubt in my mind that another wall would greet me. It’s hard to overstate the relief surging through me when there wasn’t. I let out a wheeze that startled me—the breath I hadn’t even realised I was holding.

I’d barely stepped across the threshold when I stopped dead again, all that relief gone in an instant.

This was not my hallway.

Sure, the floor was made of the same aged wooden boards, and the walls were covered in the same pastel wallpaper with the tacky floral pattern I’d never bothered to replace, but the pattern wasn’t broken up by the familiar doors to the bathroom, the kitchen, the living room—let alone the damn front door. What I saw instead was a long, straight corridor, maybe two metres wide, its end swallowed by shadows the bedside lamp couldn’t conquer.

Bile rose in my throat. I rushed back into the bedroom and slammed the door shut. Back pressed against the wood, I slid down onto the ground, knees folded up to my chest. My heart raced, breath sharp and uneven. I closed my eyes and pressed my palms against them until the dark bloomed with stars, trying to slow everything down—my thoughts, my breathing, the rising sense that I was in real, serious trouble.

As I sat there, I told myself I needed to think this through. There had to be a sensible explanation. I might not be able to figure this out, not with what little I knew—but I had to cling to that belief and start exploring my options.

As far as I could tell, I was in no immediate danger. All things considered, that was about as good a starting point as I could ask for. My window was walled in and the door led to an unfamiliar corridor, so what did that signify? What could I even infer from it? Had someone built an exact replica of my bedroom, abducted me in my sleep and left me here to stew?

I started to wonder if I was being filmed.

An idea struck me, so I got up, sat down on the bed and grabbed my phone. I opened Google Maps and tapped the little crosshair icon. All I got was a message telling me to enable the device location, which was already on. Whether I was still at home or in some madman’s bunker, GPS couldn’t seem to find me.

Without thinking about what I’d even say, I closed the app and did the obvious thing—I called the police. I figured the line would be dead, but I actually got a dial tone. My hopes didn’t last long. No one picked up.

I tried again. Same result. Then I dialed a couple other numbers—my dad, a friend from work—but that yielded only more dead air and monotonous beeping.

The internet was out, too. The little network icon didn’t seem to show it, but when I tried a Google search, it just told me it’d save my query for later when I was back online.

My mouth was parched, so I put the phone back on the nightstand and opened one of the water bottles, taking a few swigs—maybe more than I should have. I had no idea if I needed to start rationing.

I don’t know the first thing about survival. I sit behind a freaking desk all day. I haven’t even left the country since I was a kid, and while I’m hardly rich or anything, I’ve never gone hungry before. It’s not like I was locked in—as far as I could tell, I was free to leave. But what were the odds I’d find a well-stocked fridge at the end of the tunnel?

I’d been dreading the thought from the start. I don’t handle the unknown well—never have. Trying out new stuff doesn’t come naturally, so I tend to stick to what’s familiar. That probably makes me sound painfully boring, but I’ve been getting by just fine. Up until this point, at least, because the moment I pictured stepping into that corridor, I felt sick to my stomach. I absolutely did not want to do it. But the longer I dragged it out, the more obvious it became that I had to.

I grabbed some clean clothes from the dresser and put them on, then caught a glimpse of my haunted expression in the mirror. Not much I could do about the tousled hair or morning breath, since I had no clue where my bathroom was. I briefly wondered why my appearance was suddenly so important to me, but I guess I was simply stalling.

So I finally bit the bullet, shoved my phone in the pocket of my jeans and opened the door.

The corridor was still there, blackness consuming everything past the three-metre point. As I stood there peering into the dark, I finally noticed what should’ve been obvious all along: it was dead silent. This is a large building, with neighbours all around—at least one of them will make themselves known day or night. My flat was sandwiched between two families with two small kids each, always bickering and playfighting. Across the hall lives a guy my age who thinks Death Metal is best enjoyed at three in the morning. And somewhere above me there’s a Hungarian dude with a voice like a buzzsaw, constantly on the phone. Despite all that, I could hear nothing but my own breathing.

I dropped that line of thought and searched the wall near the bedroom door. There used to be a light switch there, but it was gone. I pulled out my phone again and switched on the torch, aiming the beam down the corridor. The light pushed the shadows back a fair bit, but it revealed nothing remotely reassuring. The corridor just went on and on, the floral patterns on the walls repeating indefinitely. There had to be an end to it, though… right?

Puffing out my cheeks, I let out a long breath. No more excuses. Time to move.

Anxiety made me skittish, and I kept sweeping the light left and right, watching the walls for any sign of change, so I didn’t make much progress at first. But as the minutes passed without incident, my heartbeat began to settle and I picked up the pace a little—yet the corridor kept going and going.

Two or three minutes later, I glanced over my shoulder and froze, nearly tripping over my own feet. The door to my bedroom was no more than ten metres behind me. It was like I’d been walking on a treadmill the whole time, carried right back to where I’d started. I looked down at the floor, certain it would shift beneath my feet, but the endless rows of wooden boards remained still. 

It’s hard to explain what happened next, because it defies all reason, but I’ll try. I had the bright idea to walk backwards, facing the bedroom door. Maybe if I kept my eyes on it, I’d finally get somewhere. No way that ridiculous trick could work on me if I was aware of it, right?

Sure enough, the floorboards and wallpaper seemed to move past me like they would in any normal hallway—but the fucking door never receded, not even a little.

Farther down the corridor, near the door, the patterns of wood and flowers became impossible to make out. I can only assume that at some point the moving patterns and the stationary ones converged, like an escalator vanishing into the floor. Whatever the case, no matter how fast I went—backwards, forwards, even with my eyes closed—I couldn’t get more than ten metres away from the door.

Frustration and fear boiling in my chest, I went back into my bedroom, shutting the door behind me because I couldn’t stand seeing it open. I threw myself onto the bed, killed the torch on my phone, and buried my face in the pillow. I stayed that way for a long while.

Eventually, whoever—or whatever—was behind all this seemed to get tired of my sulking. I damn near fell out of bed when I heard the sharp click of the door unlatching, followed by the familiar creak as it swung open.
