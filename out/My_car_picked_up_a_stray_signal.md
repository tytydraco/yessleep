I was driving out one night, deep in the sticks. 

Through a patch of dead air. The monotony of the road and the static of my car's radio lulled me, as my eyes felt heavier and heavier. 

I was staring up at the stars through drooping eyes, when my ears were pierced by a deafening sound emanating from the radios. 

A cacophony of human screaming. So many people, begging for help. 

I veered to the side of the road, completely caught off guard. 

Just as it had come it ended. Leaving me in near silence as the radio quietly hummed.

I went home that night, and as I lay there, unable to sleep, I thought about what had happened. I wondered if I had picked up a stray signal from someone who needed help.

The next day I went back to the spot. Guided by the screaming that projected from the radio. 

I had come prepared in case someone out there was injured. 

I'd also brought a portable radio determined to follow the signal to its source. 

So I did. I followed it as it got louder and louder. Until I reached its source. 

A large craterous hole in the ground. 

I could hear soft cries coming from within. Horrified, I now knew someone was injured down there. 

I had to help them.

So I tied a rope to a nearby tree and began my descent into its depths. The cave was humid and wet, water dripped down from the ceiling. 

The air was filled with a metallic smell, like corroded pennies.

A breeze ran through the cave, carrying with it an orchestral symphony of agony. 

I began to walk deeper when I walked on something that clinked. It was a set of keys with a tag that read apartment building 426 followed by an address. 

From a city that I knew did not exist.

As I walked deeper in. I soon found where the screams and moans of agony were coming from. 

At least a dozen people were fused into the walls, ceiling and floor of the cave. 

One man was completely fused into the stone wall, his face frozen in an expression of terror. I still remember the horrible sound of grinding stone on stone as his eyes shifted to meet me. 

There were others half fused to the stone walls crying in pain for help; some had limbs missing. Perfectly cut off, in single straight edges. 

There was no blood. Although the stumps did not seem to be cauterized. 

One man was on the floor in a fetal position. Half of him was sunken in. 

Half his face looked up at me and he began to speak to me in barely legible words.

“You have to help us, please for the love of god. Please.”

His pained murmuring quickly grew into a frantic screaming.

“MY WIFE, WHERE'S MY WIFE? YOU HAVE TO HELP HER. YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER.”

When he went quiet again, a woman's voice called out a name from the depths of the cave. 

When he heard it. 

They both erupted in agonizing wails. 

It was the sound of two people who’d had the last of their hope stripped away from them. An animalistic pained sobbing that echoed on the cavern's walls. 

I got the fuck out of there and called the police. 

Park rangers met me at the hole and told me the police had deferred the situation to them. 

The cave had been silent for the past couple of hours as I'd waited for them to arrive. They went down briefly, before coming back up and, in a frustrated tone, announced that there was no one down there. 

They suggested that I'd either made up the whole situation or had imagined the whole thing. 

As they escorted me out of the woods and to my car, they told me to leave and never come back. They said they'd arrest me if they ever saw me again.

But as I'm sitting here writing this down. I know I couldn't have made it up. 

Because I still have the keys.
