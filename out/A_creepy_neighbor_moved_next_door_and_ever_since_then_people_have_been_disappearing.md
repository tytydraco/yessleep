You know urban legends, right? Fables and myths about monsters that go bump in the night or creatures that lurk in abandoned buildings. Well, I experienced something much scarier and much more REAL than any one of those stories.  
Let me tell you a story of my own. My name is Jared Malone and I used to live in a small town in Arizona. Now, contrary to what you might think, our town was completely normal. Nothing interesting ever happened except for the occasional teenager caught shoplifting or the drunk driver veering off into a ditch. As far as everyone was concerned, our town was completely mundane and uninteresting. And then HE arrived.  
He called himself Frederick Callihan but that wasn’t his real name. Me and all of my friends knew what he was. We all called him by his actual name; the Otherman. He was a tall, pale caucasian man who moved into an old fixer-upper house on the edge of town. Now, you're probably wondering what beef I have with this guy, well, I’ll tell you. The police could never prove it; he covered his tracks expertly, but as soon as he moved in, the disappearances started.  
One after another small children would go missing and it was always small children. Sally James, a 7 year old girl, got separated from her older brother, Geoffrey James, who was walking her home from school. She was never seen again and all they recovered was her small pink bow at the scene of the crime. Ernie Polomausky, a 12 year old boy who was riding the bus. The driver dropped him off across the street from his house and drove away. He never made it home. Madison Romer, a 10 year old girl, went to the bathroom at school and never returned to class.  
How did we know it was the Otherman? We all heard the screams. We all heard the maniacal laughter, as he cut them up alive. The blood gushing and visceral splatters that came from that house… they were enough to give anyone a lifetime of nightmares. And don’t forget about the time when he struck when he didn’t know somebody was watching. Poor Timmy Tobias saw his older brother George get snatched up by a tall figure wearing a black cloak. The figure heard Timmy and turned to look at Timmy and you would never guess who was under the cloak. The emotionless pale face of Frederick Callihan.  
Now, our police force is small… like REALLY small. Aside from the police chief and his assistant, we only had one or 2 people that could really respond to 911 calls and we didn’t get any 911 calls until the Otherman moved into the neighborhood. Anyways, the police were completely unprepared to deal with all of the disappearances and the Otherman must have been a professional at hiding any trace of his involvement too. Any CCTV footage was either offline at the time or only showed the victim walking offscreen before disappearing into thin air. Fingerprints or any other DNA evidence were never found. Not even a footprint. You could have likened it to the victim walking into another dimension or no clipping into the backrooms. They just vanished without a trace.  
The police were completely stumped, even the sheriff. Now, our police force may have been small but Sheriff Bartly was a retired detective who used to work in the New York Police Department, so he was nothing to scoff at, but even he had not the slightest idea where these children were going. Nobody even suspected the Otherman except us kids. And don’t think we didn’t try telling them. Adults never tend to believe children even if they’ve never lied before and there's no such thing as a kid who hasn’t lied before. We all have. Even adults lie. From the simplest white lie of “I didn’t eat the cookie!” to something worse like “I didn’t steal your 1 dollar bill you left out!”   
It didn’t help that, for whatever reason, the adults could never hear the Otherman killing his prey. They always heard a normal, silent night while us kids were quaking in our boots listening to the Otherman’s slaughter fest. All of the adults just saw the Otherman as that cliche village wackadoodle who just sat in his house all day and stared out his window with the classic “get off my lawn!” expression. They never saw the creepy smiles he gave whenever a child walked near his house. Or maybe they just turned a blind eye to it, refusing to believe that he was a monster who was kidnapping and torturing innocent children. After a while, us kids started taking other routes to and from school, anything to avoid his horrific gaze.  
The adults just thought we were being dramatic but no matter how much convincing or punishment we got, we would never go anywhere near that thing's house. We avoided it like the plague. We probably would have stopped taking the bus that drove by his house too if it wasn’t for the constant fear that he might “get us” while we were walking home.  
Now that you're caught up on most of what was happening, let me tell you about my experience. Lots of other kids had lost their brothers and sisters, parents had lost their children, but we all knew it was only a matter of time before it was our turn. It became like a sort of school legend. And then, my brother disappeared. My brother Bobby missed the bus and was forced to walk home from school. All the kids knew that he was next and watched him get further and further away through the bus windows as the bus speedily drove away from him. Then, they turned the corner and he was gone. Without a trace. Just like all of the other kids.  
Now, I was a bit of a coward back then, and having the Otherman’s sadistic hobby of child kidnapping hit so close to home didn't help my fears at all. I became constantly paranoid at school and home. Even when I knew that nothing could hurt me, like when I was in a room full of people, I was still paranoid. I couldn’t get that monster off of my mind and my grades suffered because of it. All I cared about was not becoming like my late brother and being taken by the Otherman. But no matter how many precautions are taken, things always go wrong. Remember how I said my grade was suffering? Well, my teachers noticed and I was given a detention to finish missing work afterschool. Now, me and every other kid in the school knew that this was as good as a death sentence. If you were kept after school, then you missed the bus and had to walk home… alone. And that's exactly when he would strike.  
It didn’t matter how much I begged the teachers. Of course, they thought I was being dramatic just like every other kid going on about the Otherman. And so I sat, after school, in detention. I couldn’t focus on my work, not when I knew that I was about to die. Because as I was told to go home, I knew that I would meet the same fate as every other kid who found themselves alone in this cursed neighborhood. Dead by the Otherman.  
I thought about all of the horrible things that creature would do to me after he took me to his horrible, musty, bloodstained house. What would he use to kill me? Would he saw off my limbs one by one? Or maybe slit my throat and watch me slowly bleed out. Or maybe… Just maybe, he would leave me in his basement with the corpses of every child he found until I starved to death.  
My thoughts were interrupted by my english teacher, Mr. Jacobs, voice.  
“Alrighty kid. You can go home now,” he said.  
I slowly stood up and began to walk to the door. As I stood at the exit of the school I looked out and thought I could hear the Otherman beckoning me from the other side, just out of sight.  
“C’mom Jared! No need to be scared. I’ll make it quick and painless,” I imagined the Otherman saying.  
Nobody had ever heard the Otherman talk, heck, for all we knew he only ever left his house to go child hunting. But deep down, I knew this raspy wheezing voice was exactly what he sounded like.  
I shook with fear as I slowly reached for the door and I opened it. I stepped onto the quiet, mostly empty school parking lot. I looked around but I didn’t see the Otherman. I began to quietly walk away from the school building. Every twig snap or gust of wind was enough to send me into a sprint. But carefully and quietly, I managed to walk all the way from the school to my house with no issues. I never stopped being jumpy until I could see my house, and when I did, my nerves finally started to relax but then I heard it. 3 words that are still burned into my mind even all these years after.  
“Why, hello there!” A raspy voice said from behind me.  
I froze and slowly turned around and, sure enough, was the tall smiling old man, the Otherman, Frederick Callihan.  
“Awfully late for you to be walking home. School ended hours ago,” he said, that sadistic smile never leaving his pale scarred face.  
Then, he took a step forward and slowly began to walk to me. I booked it. I ran as fast as I could but it was no use. The Otherman was insanely fast, much much faster than any normal old man his age could run. Within seconds, he caught up to me and pushed me onto the ground. You know that feeling you get when you're about to die? When your life flashes before your eyes and all fear seems to drain from your mind as you gaze into your impending doom? That's what I felt. Except I didn’t lose any fear. I knew it was over for me. The Otherman slowly walked towards me as I laid on the ground, helpless.  
“Ready to join your brother?” he said, still with that same inhuman grin. I had never noticed it before, but deep down, I knew that that grin was completely alien. It was wider than anything a man could make and the way it permeated the space around him, it made him seem as if he REALLY enjoyed what he was doing, all of the pain and sorrow he was causing, the lives he was taking. And then suddenly, I blacked out.  
The next thing I remembered was waking up in a small bedroom. It was a dark and dreadful space and from the second I opened my eyes, I was in the place where all of the other children had awaited their execution. All I did in that moment was cry, a pitiful drowned out sob and I felt complete hopelessness. I sat there for what felt like hours, waiting for that thing, the inhuman monster, to enter the room and take me to my death. But then out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a glint of silver. My first thought was a key but I wasn’t that lucky. It just appeared to be a jagged piece of metal that had broken off from a pipe running across the ceiling. But I had an idea. I had seen spy movies back before all of the Otherman business had ever started. I saw the protagonist use the metal to pick a lock or fend off his imprisoner. I decided that I had nothing else to lose so I took the small piece of metal and jammed it into the lock. It felt like I was there twisting and turning the metal for hours even though it was probably only 30 minutes until I heard a faint click come from the door.  
But it was already too late, as the second I opened the door, I saw the tall figure of the Otherman waiting for me on the other side. He looked as if he had expected this to happen and his hideous grin never faltered.  
“Have you had a nice sleep?” it said, but it no longer sounded like a man.   
The voice which used to be menacing and unnerving sounded more attuned to a low pitch gargle, filled with distortion. This only added to the creep factor.  
At that moment, only one thought occurred to me.  
Run.  
And so I ran. As fast as I could. The second I started, the Otherman lept into action but he tripped! The small stumble of the 7 foot monstrosity that used to be a man came tumbling to the ground  
And at that moment, all I did was run. The nearest door was to the left of me and I sped there as fast as I could. I opened the door, ran in, and slammed it shut, locking it. Not seconds after I closed the door did I hear the inhuman roars of that thing on the other side and it began to pound and bang on the door. Based on the volume of the smashes, I judged that I only had a minute or two before it broke down the door and ripped me to pieces.  
I turned around to run and my heart dropped. It was a staircase, but it led down, further into the labyrinth that the Otherman called home. But I had no choice, so I ran down the staircase as fast as I could and you would never believe what I saw next, assuming you do believe everything else I’ve been telling you.  
It was a small room with an orange glowing vortex in the middle. A portal of some sort…  
I heard a massive crash behind me and the door came flying down the stairs. Without a second thought, I jumped into the vortex and It felt as if I was falling. I could see nothing but a massive black void. I fell for minutes straight and then I landed. Now you would expect somebody to die if they had been falling at terminal velocity, especially for a prolonged amount of time, but when I landed, I felt no pain and had no injuries, not even a scratch. I got up and looked around. I was right outside of the Otherman’s house, but it was rundown and abandoned as it had been before he moved in. Had this thing sent me back in time before the Otherman had come here?  
I excitedly got up to go to my house but my excitement quickly died away when I saw what was before me. Every other house on the block, including my own, was abandoned and in various states of disrepair.  
The entire town was trashed and there wasn’t a soul in sight.  
As I walked around my abandoned town I knew, no matter how much I told myself not too, that this was not my neighborhood, this was not my world. This was another world he had ravaged. He had finished with it and moved on to mind and that's when I realized that I could never go back.  
And so I’ve been living here the rest of my life. Not in the abandoned town, but in another across the country. I couldn’t stay there after everything that had happened there. It seemed whatever curse this was, It only seemed to affect my town. Every other place is the exact same.  
If you are reading this, stay far away from my town. You never know when the Otherman could come back for seconds. And if he does, pray that he won’t target your town next.
