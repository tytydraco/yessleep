I saw my little boy die right in front of me. It’s a moment burned into my mind—his tiny frame crumpling at the bottom of the stairs, the sickening crack of bone, the silence that followed. God the silence. 

I know that is an odd way of starting this, but I just mean—I hate silence. Silence has a way of stretching moments like that, making them infinite. The paramedics said it was an accident, but the look in their eyes told me they didn’t believe it. Neither did my wife. 

It’s been years, but the sound of silence still gets under my skin. So much so that when I was a kid, my parents used to tell me to turn off the TV and go to bed, but I couldn’t sleep without something playing in the background—a sitcom, the hum of a fan, anything to keep the quiet away. I even slept with headphones on for many years. Silence stretches things out, makes my mind wander to places I don’t want to go. 

That’s why this building is so hard to live in. It’s dead quiet. No neighbors arguing through thin walls. No music playing in the distance. Just this oppressive, suffocating silence. I don’t even hear footsteps in the hall. Not once in the six months I’ve lived here.

The apartment is part of a government housing program. They called it temporary, just a way to help me get back on my feet after everything fell apart. The paperwork was vague, but I didn’t have the luxury of asking questions. I needed somewhere cheap, and this place was free.

It’s old. Wallpaper peeling in the corners kind of old. Water stains creeping across the ceilings kind of old.. It’s horrible. My unit is basic—one bedroom, a tiny kitchen, a window that overlooks a cracked courtyard. At first, I thought it was decent, all things considered. Then I started noticing the dust.

It’s everywhere. No matter how much I clean, it comes back. A thin, gray film that coats every surface overnight. It’s in the hallways too. Everything feels untouched, like the building’s been abandoned for years. It’s like the building is a place where they put you to get you out of society—then forget about you in the process. 

I told myself the place must be mostly empty. It would explain the silence, right? But then I noticed other things—like how the elevator skips certain floors. The button for the third floor is there, but it doesn’t light up when you press it.

I thought maybe it was broken. Until the night the elevator stopped there on its own.

It happened a few days ago. I was coming back late from a walk in the lobby, trying to shake off another sleepless night, when the elevator stopped on one of those “inaccessible” floors, the third floor. I didn’t press the button. I didnt even realise it had not reached my fourth floor yet. 

Then the doors opened. 

There was a faint buzz coming from the fluorescent lights inside, one of them kept flickering at irregular intervals.

It didn’t look like the rest of the building. The entire area was bright white and smelt like rubbing alcohol, the kind that would burn your nose. Very clinical. I eventually stepped out, half-expecting someone to jump out and yell “Boo!” like it was some elaborate prank. But the hall was empty.

And silent. 

I walked forward, my footsteps seemed to echo through the hall. There were doors lining the walkway, but all of them were locked. They had little glass windows, but since the lights were off in their rooms I couldn’t see in. One door stood out in particular though, a metal door directly at the end. A soft hum came from behind it, the only sound breaking the stillness.

When I opened the door, I found an office. It was as run down as the other floors in the building. Rusted filing cabinets, a desk cluttered with papers, but with a modern computer and monitor showing security cameras from a bunch of different rooms on each floor. Someone was spying on us. At that moment I realised there were actually a lot of other residents. I looked down and saw a coffee sitting on top of the desk, still hot and steaming. Someone had just been in here.

Then I saw the files.

There were stacks of them, spilling onto the floor. All labelled ‘CONFIDENTIAL.’ The top one caught my eye because it had my name on it.

My hands shook as I opened it. Inside were pages of typed notes, observations written in sterile, clinical language. Words like “delusional episodes” jumped out at me.

I flipped through and found photos of myself. One was from years ago—me smiling, holding my son, Thomas. He was so small, so full of life. The second photo was different. I looked older, haggard. Wearing all white clothing. Thomas wasn’t in that one.

The notes grew darker: “Fixation on deceased son.” “Fixated on growing silence.” My throat tightened. Someone was clearly trying to screw with my head. Someone was trying to frame me. I am not crazy. 

I dropped the file back onto the desk and backed away. A noise behind me snapped me out of my thoughts.

Footsteps.

I spun around, but the hallway was empty. The only sound was the fluorescent light buzzing overhead.

I grabbed the folder and bolted for the elevator.

I couldn’t sleep that night, obviously. I sat at my kitchen table, the folder spread out in front of me for what felt like hours.

The notes felt like they’d been written by a stranger, someone who’d been watching me through a warped lens. Someone wanted me to be sick. They described things I didn’t remember doing, conversations I didn’t recall having. 

The next morning, I went to the building manager’s office in the lobby.

I demanded to know who keeps the files on residents. Demanded to know what’s going on—He looked baffled so I held up the file for him to see I was not crazy.

He frowned, looking genuinely confused, as if it were me who wrote it. “We don’t keep any files like that,” he said. “Where did you even find that?”

I didn’t answer. His confusion seemed real, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was lying. He had to be right? I am not crazy. 

When I went back up to my room I tried the elevator’s third floor button again, but nothing would light up. 

That night, I woke to a sound outside my apartment door.

A soft rustling, like someone sliding something beneath the door.

I crept to the peephole, but no one was there. When I looked down, I found another folder lying on the floor.

It didn’t have my name on it, so I thought that it wasn’t mine at first.

This one was labeled “Administrative Notes #427.”

I opened it. Inside was what looked like records of staff rotations for a particular room. One page stood out:
"Patient #427 displays increased curiosity about restricted areas. Recommended measures: heightened observation and restricted access to communal areas. Check in through in-room security cameras periodically."

The blood drained from my face. Patient #427. My apartment number.

I looked around the room trying to find a camera, but there was none. I must have torn apart the entire place trying to find one. I am not crazy. Someone is screwing with me. I don’t know why.  

I don’t know what’s real anymore.

I hope this reaches someone out there. Most websites are blocked on the buildings wifi, but they don’t realise there are ways to get around it. 

So now, I’m writing this from the desk in my apartment, my door locked, every light in the room turned off so they can’t see me. 

I keep telling myself this is all a misunderstanding. That it’s just some bureaucratic mistake, because I am not crazy.

But deep down, I think I know the truth about what’s happening here.

This isn’t an apartment building. It never was. 

And I’m not a tenant. 

I’m a patient, in their fucked up experiment. 

I am not crazy. 

They’re watching me.

I am not. 

They’re always watching.

I am.
