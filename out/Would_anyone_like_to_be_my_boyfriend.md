Would anyone like to be my boyfriend?

I am in the greater Chicago area and am looking for someone who would like to be my boyfriend. A girlfriend is also fine!

I am the daughter of my family unit. I am sixteen. My family also consists of a mother, father and brother. We have been together for the last two years, and we haven’t had any issues to date!

If you are serious about joining us, there are some requirements and things you should know.

Firstly, any ethnicity is fine. We are not picky about your appearance, so long as you look 15-17 years in age. Bonus points if you’re cute!

If you are new to this and unsure where to start, I compiled a list of some men that make for perfect choices. I’ve kept tabs on them for weeks and can confirm they wont be missed. So long as you are capable of cleaning your own messes! Our family enjoys our privacy.

You will also need to play the part of my boyfriend well. This includes buying me flowers, taking me on dates and the occasional kiss. If the father acts like he doesn’t like you, don’t fret. It’s part of his role.

You should also have your own personality. Feel free to try out different hobbies and traits and see what works best for you. I myself am a cheerleader and like popular music. I have found high school movies help in getting ideas.

Speaking of roles, yours is very important. We all serve a purpose in our family. These roles help us blend in with our community. If we fail to do so, we will have to move again. Moving is hard on everyone and we’d like to avoid it as much as possible! I’m sure you understand how much easier it is to hunt when no one’s paying attention.

As my boyfriend, you cannot tell anyone that you live in our house. If they ask where you’re from, you say Chicago. If they ask about your family, you say they are busy. You are an only child. Your parents are often out of town due to work. This story will allow for the least amount of follow up questions.

You will also attend my high school. The mother and father will help you enroll. The school will not notice you don’t belong.

I highly encourage you develop a make-up routine as well. This helps to hide the places where the skin doesn’t sit just right.

After a hunt, you will have to lay low for a few days to let the skin settle. The father will take care of the meat. We have a basement you can use. I recommend spending this time looking through our dvd collection and studying films that help to build your image. As I said before, it’s helped me a ton. 

Once your body is ready to go, we will introduce you to the community. We will start slow and gradually increase the amount of public interactions until you acclimate. 

If there is anyone who asks too many questions, please inform the mother.

I think that covers everything! My family appreciates your commitment and is excited to meet you. If you can send us a message stating your interest before the end of the year, that would be amazing! I’d love to start off the new year with someone to kiss at the ball drop.

Happy hunting!
