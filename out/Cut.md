I’d done stunts in films before. Fake falls, broken glass, bruised knees. Nothing that couldn’t be brushed off. But *Crimson Harvest* was different. The director, Weiss, kept saying: *“No fakery. Pain reads true.”*

My role was a woman trapped in a rural cult, hunted and sacrificed. The script was violent, but Weiss wasn’t interested in acting. He wanted reality, how flesh bends, how fear manifests.

We all thought it was method acting.

The first time it happened was small. A scene where I was bound and dragged across a dirt floor. Instead of the usual ropes padded with foam, they tied me with coarse hemp. My wrists split open by the third take, blood slicking the knots. When I cried out, Weiss leaned in. “Perfect. Don’t stop.”

The crew didn’t meet my eyes.

Another scene: I was supposed to be branded by the cult. The effects team had made a prop iron, but Weiss replaced it with the real thing. The searing hiss against my thigh was no act. I screamed, the cameras caught it, and Weiss clapped his hands like he’d won a prize.

Each night I went back to the hotel, shaking, bandaged, telling myself I would quit. But when I opened my phone, my bank account, the contract, the promises of awards....quitting never seemed like an option.

Then came the film's climax.

Weiss gathered the cast and crew around a barn lit by harsh spotlights. My character was to be tied to a wooden beam, her chest cut open in a ritual. “It'll be a fake knife,” the prop master whispered to me earlier, his face pale. But when the cameras rolled, Weiss snatched the real blade.

The first slice was shallow, across my ribs. I gasped, the pain flooding me in waves. Weiss crouched beside me, urging the cameraman closer. “Don’t you see? She’s transcending!”

I thrashed, blood soaking through my dress, dripping onto the dirt. The crew stood frozen, the actors in their cult masks unmoving. For a moment, I thought someone would stop him. But no one did.

The second cut went deeper. My scream tore my throat raw. I felt warm liquid pooling beneath me, smelled iron and sweat and rot.

Weiss’s face hovered above mine, ecstatic. “This is true cinema! You’re giving me eternity.”

Something in me snapped. Maybe it was a survival instinct. Maybe rage. I wrenched one hand free, the rope soaked with my blood. My fingers found the knife handle, still buried shallow in my side.

I drove it upward into Weiss’s throat.

The cameras kept rolling as he fell, gurgling, eyes wide with disbelief. The crew didn’t move, didn’t cut the feed. They just filmed as I staggered upright, slick with blood, clutching the blade.

I looked into the lens. For once, no acting. Just me - broken, alive, furious.

The cameraman didn’t lower the camera. The boom operator didn’t flinch. No one rushed in. 

Weiss was gone, but their silence told me everything: he hadn’t been the only one hungry for this.

If they wanted horror, I’d give it to them.

I staggered forward, the knife heavy in my hand, and turned it toward the crew.

For the first time all shoot, I felt in control. And I wasn’t about to yell "cut".
