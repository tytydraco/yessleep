  
It has been 15 years since I made the biggest mistake of my life, which I still have not been able to fix. I thought I had lost this phone, my only connection to the realm of my birth. My original world. I cannot undo my mistake but I can guide future players.  
  
My phone it's android. It has a IR blaster, the only reason I bought it, and for some reason, this phone can hold its network through the dimensional change. As if it's a loophole, a glitch in the broken matrix that i was facing. Not that i could actually make any use of it because I am still here.  
  
I am married to a beautiful man. "Man", I don't even know if i should be considering him a man, he looks like one, acts like one, he probably is one as well, they all do. They are very sapient. They look just like us. But my bones know that they don't have the same origin as I do. They are good though. Have the same societal issues, the same intolerable governing body, protestors and everything. they are humans, just like us, but they are not us. We have a son. He is beautiful as well. I love him dearly and he seems to notice things only i can do. I guess that's our origin inside him doing it.  
  
Either way enough about how I have "adjusted" to this world. More about how you should not enter one like this and if you do then how you should get the frick out of here while you can.  
  
The rules stated by the urban legend still strike the same to this day, follow the floor number pattern, pay no heed to the lady that enters the elevator on the 5th floor, leave the building immediately if you return to floor 1, etc. I followed them all correctly, but the rules are no guarantee as to whether you will be safe or alive after your elevator journey is done, the rules only make sure the procedure is correct.  
  
Hey you know what I will write down the rules in short, for your reference to my guidelines but the rules should always be memorized to your bones and spine, this is your sos and your key. You will find the set of rules on any website. I suggest visiting multiple of them before you start your endeavor. Because each of them gives you different kinds of warnings, something the successful players learned from their own experience. And take this advice of reading through all of those points from this unsuccessful player.  
  
One thing the rules on blog sites don't mention is the choice of which world you want to enter. Because most players enter an identical world with no electronics and no living thing around them. Only a red crossed window that's far stretched away from where ever you look and keeps on moving further away from you. My case was vaguely different.  
  
1. So firstly all you do is enter a building with more than 10 stories.  
  
2. enter the lift via the first floor and only by pressing the "up" button  
  
3. Follow a pattern of floors, press 4 then 2 then 6 then 10 then 5.  
  
4. On 5 a lady shall or shall not enter your floor. Then press 1  
  
5. When you press 1, you will either reach 1. or you will reach 10.  
  
6. If you reach 1, get the f out of the building and don't come near it, not in 6-7 months i suggest.  
  
7. if you do reach 10 congratulations. your first part of the journey is a success  
  
now Something, about the lady. Do not interact with her at any cost because of course she is not a lady, no matter how pretty she looks, oh you looked at her? alas, that's also a grave mistake. don't look at her, don't talk to her. Just ignore her total existence. If you know of the elevator game you are already aware of how you should not interact with the lady and all. But one thing is often left blurry is that what you should if she does not enter. This was my case.  
  
So my advice here: If the lady on the 5th floor does not enter. Then just hope that you do return to the 1st floor after you press it. if you do no then, and start ascending. continuously press any and every floor button for it to stop, or maybe the emergency or call button so that the staff can stop the elevator. Because if you end up reaching the 10th floor, good chances are you get to meet me and we make a cute therapy consult group for people who can't return back. :)  
  
I remember everything from that night so vividly. I did your usual pattern follow. I entered the lift when no one was using it. I entered 4. went up there, meh nothing happened. Then again I pressed 2. I felt a vague chill around me. As if the mechanism of the ritual was understanding my intention. I pressed 6, then after it reached 6, I pressed 2, then 10 then 5. Oh, 5. The elevator door opened. And there she was, standing with all her glory. I did not look at her. but of course, i could see her from waist to bottom. She was dressed in Russian traditional clothing. not something i was expecting from an urban legend that became popular in korea and japan. I think her wardrobe is a good collection from all cultures. or maybe there's more like her? Who knows?  
  
I could feel it in my spine she was looking at me. She stopped the elevator with her foot, so that the doors don't close and asked, "baby which floor you going?"  
  
I followed the rules, did not look at her, did not reply her, and completely ignored her.  
  
she said, "Not much of a speaker eh? no worries have your ride. I hope you have a better life."  
  
I have no idea why she said that. Looking back I think she knew what was going to happen to me. She knew that I was not going to end up in the world most player venture into. "Better life," she said.  
  
She did not enter the lift and I pressed 1. The ritual, now tainted because she did not enter, worked. I reached the 10th floor. And when the doors opened, it was like nothing changed. The building i entered was a hotel. The housekeeping staff were running around. I heard children crying. Some Karen was screaming at a worker because her coffee, which she made from their amenities tasted bland. It was very confusing for me. I think i assumed the ritual did not work. And the lady was just another lady who could have been high. I walked out of the elevator and I felt great.  
  
"those silly online urban legends, such lies" i probably had muttered to myself.  
  
I took the lift again, reached the ground floor, and walked out of the building. Everything was going well until my head started hurting and spinning. and i was slowly passing out. and that's the exact moment i remembered from one of the posts of an earlier player "Do not at any chance lose your consciousness. and if you do, no matter where you wake up, return to the building, re-follow the exit ritual pattern and return to your own world"
