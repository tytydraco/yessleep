For six years, Andrés had worked the night shift at the customer service center, known by the veteran employees as "Graveyard." A sinister name that Andrés remembered every time he swiped his magnetic ID to start his shift, every day at 9:00 p.m. Every night, after dealing with the last customer, Andrés headed to the basement parking lot to pick up his old Volkswagen, just before four in the morning.

It was an oppressive place, inconsiderate of the integrity of its employees. And this was clear by the way they opened a massive building just to accommodate six workers, one of whom was a supervisor, and another a security guard. Four souls in a sea of phones that rang no more than a dozen times throughout the night. The hallways were long and deserted, illuminated by flickering fluorescent lights that cast shadows on the walls. The atmosphere was heavy, laden with a tension that could be sliced, as if the air itself was imbued with a sense of despair.

During the night, it was common to randomly encounter another coworker at the bathroom door or the fridge in the common area, where there were only four containers of prepared food and a couple of generic brand sodas, courtesy of the "considerate" company administration. The common area was devoid of any comfort, with worn-out furniture and a gloomy ambiance that clearly reflected the company's indifference towards its employees. The vending machines were outdated and often malfunctioned, forcing employees to fix them with whatever was available.

Andrés had grown accustomed to the silence that reigned at those hours, broken only by the echo of his own footsteps or the shouts over the phone from some American citizen with a southern accent, seemingly designed solely to hurl racist insults at someone trying to help solve a problem from the other side of the world. Each call was a battle, a constant reminder of the lack of respect and disdain for his job. Often, Andrés felt his patience wearing thin with every hurtful word and every unjustified complaint.

At the end of his shift, Andrés felt the fatigue take over his body, his eyelids heavy and his movements slow. The walk to the basement parking lot had become a monotonous and disheartening routine. Sometimes Andrés couldn't remember lapses of time, arriving home without the slightest recollection of how he got there. Whole blocks of life ran on autopilot, as if handled by someone who didn't want to be there at that moment, in that place. As he descended the stairs, the sounds of his own footsteps echoed against the concrete walls, amplifying the emptiness of the parking lot.

The basement was dark, with emergency lights always on but dim, creating a play of light and shadow that made Andrés feel watched. The damp stains on the walls and the dirty floor gave a sense of abandonment and neglect. The distant noises of the building's machinery mingled with the sounds of the night, creating an eerie symphony that made Andrés feel increasingly isolated, vulnerable.

At times, he thought about how he ended up in this job, reflecting on his lost dreams and aspirations while passing by the coffee machine, pouring himself a cup with a muddy taste that barely helped him stay awake.

The first time his car failed was on an unusually silent night. The motors and machinery usually used to maintain the emergency lights and other equipment were mute that day, like when you're underwater and perceive the sounds from the surface muffled. The air was filled with an inexplicable tension, a sense of expectancy as if something terrible was about to happen. Andrés tried to start the car and, to his surprise, it wouldn't start.

He sat in the driver's seat, his trembling hands turning the key over and over. Each failed attempt increased his desperation. The minutes passed agonizingly slow, sweat dripping down his forehead in thick drops, soaking his shirt and running down his cheeks. His breathing became increasingly erratic, with short gasps breaking the oppressive silence of the basement. He could feel his heart pounding in his ears, a frantic rhythm adding to his growing anxiety.

The car seemed silent too, a dead machine that wouldn't respond to his pleas. The darkness around Andrés felt increasingly dense, as if the shadows were alive and slowly closing in to envelop him. He could hear the faint hum of the flickering fluorescent lights, the barely perceptible sound of his own distress. He looked around, searching for any sign of life in the void of the parking lot, but all he saw were shadows lengthening and moving subtly in the corner of his eye.

Finally, after sixteen minutes that seemed like an eternity, the car roared to life with a sudden noise that echoed in the emptiness of the basement, bouncing off the concrete walls and amplifying the sound. The engine coughed, breaking the spell of silence that had dominated the place. Andrés exhaled a sigh of relief, his hands still trembling as they rested on the steering wheel.

He sat there for a moment, trying to calm his breathing and convince himself it was just a minor glitch. But when the same problem happened the next day, a growing unease began to consume his mind. Each failed attempt to start the car became a ritual of desperation and fear, and the feeling that something was deeply wrong grew inside him, somehow connected to that car, slowly eroding his sanity. Every night, the drive home was filled with dark thoughts and unanswered questions, increasing his sense of isolation and paranoia.

With each passing night, those sixteen minutes became an endless torture. As he waited, trapped in helplessness, something strange began to happen. Through the rearview mirror, he saw flashes of lights in the depths of the basement, faint at first, but growing brighter as the days went by. At first, he thought it was a reflection, but they increasingly resembled two eyes, although they weren't really eyes. They were just two white lights that blinked three times and then disappeared without a trace. He could never see them directly; they always appeared in a brief moment of three blinks, always in his peripheral vision, always out of reach. But with the certainty that, day after day, they were there.

A chill ran down his spine every time he saw them. He tried to ignore them, telling himself they were just a product of his fatigue, but the reality was that his heart raced increasingly with a growing panic. The basement lights seemed to dance in the dimness, growing wider in their reach. The air grew heavier, and the feeling of being watched intensified with each night.

Andrés felt his breathing become faster and shallower. Cold sweat began to bead on his forehead, his hands trembling as he gripped the steering wheel tightly, clinging to it like a branch about to break. He could feel the pounding of his heart in his ears, a frantic drumming that added to his anxiety. Each flash of light imprinted itself in his mind, leaving a lingering sense of unease long after the lights had vanished. The three flashes became a constant torment, a sign that something was wrong, that something was lurking in the darkness, playing with his sanity.

Over time, those flashes began to dominate his thoughts during the day as well. While working, he could feel a knot of anxiety in his stomach, anticipating the moment when he would have to face those lights again. His coworkers noticed his distraction and exhaustion, but Andrés couldn't share with them what he was experiencing; they would immediately think he was crazy. They had already thought so when, in a moment of vulnerability, he told them about the four years under treatment with medication he had undergone with his psychiatrist. The feeling of isolation and paranoia grew each day, making his world shrink to those sixteen minutes.

Andrés tried to convince himself that it was all a hallucination caused by fatigue, but each time he saw the flashes, his rationality crumbled a little more. He began to avoid looking in the rearview mirror, but fear and curiosity always won, only to confirm that the lights were still there in the corner of his vision, mocking his inability to understand what they were or where they came from. His mind filled with unanswered questions, and each night became a battle against fear and despair.

Each failed attempt to start the car left him feeling more vulnerable and exposed. The concrete walls of the basement seemed to close in around him, as if they were alive and wanted to trap him. The echo of the few sounds he could perceive, like the distant drip of a pipe or the creaking of the building, amplified in the vastness of the empty parking lot, making his skin crawl.

The nights turned into a succession of terrifying and exhausting events. Each time the lights flashed, something went with them. The isolation, extreme fatigue, and constant fear began to take a heavy toll on his mental health. Weeks ago, he even had a full block of time where he couldn't remember how he had gotten home, nor to whom he had lent his sweatshirt, the same one he had worn almost daily for the past three years to work. His eyes sank deeper into their sockets, the dark circles became more pronounced, and his skin took on a pale, sickly tone. The hallucinations during the day became more frequent, more vivid, and the line between reality and fantasy began to dangerously blur.

Those flashes watched him, and he stood there, with sixteen minutes of his day that seemed frozen, his heart pounding wildly in his chest. Anguish gripped his mind, spreading like poison through his body. He began to notice his hands shaking uncontrollably, his knuckles turning white from gripping the steering wheel so tightly. His breathing became a frantic pant, each breath a desperate effort to maintain control.

The accumulated fatigue and pressure of the night shift were affecting him more than he wanted to admit. Despite receiving only a few calls during the night, Andrés couldn't help feeling completely drained. Each call was a small battle that left an indelible mark on his spirit. His thoughts grew increasingly dark and chaotic, as if a cloud of despair was enveloping his mind.

Andrés felt that his mind wason the verge of breaking, a fragile barrier that weakened with each flash of light. His ears buzzed with the echo of his own gasps, amplifying the sound of his frantically beating heart.

Andrés tried to concentrate on other things, recalling happy moments or thinking of rational solutions, but he always returned to the same point: the lights, the fear, and the feeling of being watched, of being singled out. His world shrank to that small space in his car, to those endless minutes that threatened to devour his sanity.

The extreme fatigue made him vulnerable, his thoughts crumbling and fragmenting into a thousand pieces. The deep dark circles under his eyes and the constant tremor in his hands were visible signs of his deterioration. Sometimes, as he turned the key in the car, he wondered how much longer he could endure before his mind finally gave way. Each night became a test of endurance, a desperate struggle to maintain sanity in the midst of a sea of darkness and fear.

At work, he began to have minor hallucinations: hearing voices whispering his name and seeing shadows that seemed to move out of the corner of his eye. The fluorescent lights in the building cast angular shadows that, when flickering, seemed to come to life, feeding his paranoia. One night, while trying to fall asleep after another exhausting shift, he dreamed he was on the road.

The dream was a completely dark scene, with no sound except for a diffuse, constant tapping that resonated in his head, as if someone were dulling pounding his skull from within. The flashes of light in the dream were blinding, appearing and disappearing with a disturbing cadence. Andrés tried to drive, but the road vanished into the darkness, leaving him lost and disoriented. He felt a pressure in his chest, a suffocating sensation he couldn't explain. The shadows at the edge of his vision moved menacingly, and although he knew it was just a dream, he couldn't escape the feeling of impending danger.

He woke up drenched in sweat, his heart pounding with a force that seemed to shake his entire body. His breathing was an irregular pant, and his sheets were soaked. He tried to recall the dream completely, but only disjointed fragments remained in his mind: the total darkness, the dull sounds, and that omnipresent sense of terror that accompanied two lights.

Each morning, after those unsettling dreams, Andrés woke up more tired than before going to bed. The days blurred with the nights in a haze of fatigue and anxiety. Each time he closed his eyes, he feared what he might see or hear. The whispers and shadows at work became more insistent, more real. His coworkers noticed his pallor and the tremor in his hands, but Andrés couldn't explain what was happening to him. Fear and paranoia had become his constant companions, slowly eroding his mental health.

Andrés felt he was trapped in a strange cycle. Each night, the walk to the basement grew longer and darker, and the flashes of light more brilliant and threatening. His dreams became darker and more disturbing, and the line between reality and fantasy dangerously blurred. Each day, Andrés struggled to maintain a facade of normality, while his mind fragmented under the weight of constant fear and growing hallucinations.

Desperate to understand what was happening, Andrés began investigating the flashes. He meticulously checked his car and the parking lot, hoping it was all due to a leak of some fuel or toxic fluid in the engine. He spent hours inspecting every corner, looking for a logical explanation that could alleviate his growing anxiety. However, he found nothing unusual, only the old dent on the front of the car that had lowered its price the day he bought it, although he couldn't even remember the price.

Each discovery, or lack thereof, brought fragments of fuzzy memories, flashes of repetitive dreams. In his mind, he saw himself driving on a dark road, while everything around him vanished into the darkness. The feeling of getting lost in that darkness was terrifying and constant.

The nights when he couldn't find an answer grew longer and more torturous. Andrés began to question his own sanity, wondering if it was all a product of his exhausted and stressed mind. He saw flashes even during the day, small flickers of light that appeared and disappeared out of the corner of his eye.

The lack of answers consumed him. Each night he felt more tired and less able to face the normalized cycle of empty work and deep terror. The flashes became an obsession, something he couldn't ignore or explain. Andrés felt his world slowly falling apart.

One night, after another exhausting shift, Andrés decided to stay in the car, waiting. The fatigue weighed on his shoulders like a slab, and the anxiety twisted his stomach into knots of tension. The shadows in the parking lot seemed denser, more threatening, as if they were alive and closing in around him. Every dark corner of the basement seemed to harbor an invisible danger, a menacing presence moving stealthily beyond his visual reach.

He tried to move his hand to start the car, but he couldn't. His fingers felt like lead, immobile, trapped by a paralyzing fear. Every attempt at movement was futile, as if his limbs were bound by invisible strings. The paralysis spread through his body, leaving him completely helpless. The sense of powerlessness was overwhelming.

Andrés was paralyzed, reliving something he couldn't fully remember. Fragments of images and sounds filled his mind: the dark road, the flickering lights, the muffled sounds. It was like being trapped in a nightmare of his own creation, one where the shadows and flashes were his jailers. His eyes were wide open, fixed on the flashes reflected in the rearview mirror, each blink a reminder of his terror.

Time stretched infinitely. Seconds turned into minutes, and each minute into an eternity. Andrés felt the panic consuming his mind, his breathing growing increasingly erratic. He tried to scream, but no sound came from his mouth. He was trapped in a deafening silence, where he could only hear the frantic pounding of his heart and the echo of his own thoughts.

The lights flickered with a hypnotic cadence, three rapid blinks that seemed synchronized with the beats of his heart. Each flash was a stab of terror, a reaffirmation of his powerlessness. Andrés knew he was on the brink of collapse, his sanity hanging by a fragile thread.

At that moment, something in the back of his mind struggled to surface, fighting to break the barriers of his subconscious. Andrés could feel there was a hidden truth, something he needed to remember but his mind refused to release. It was an internal struggle, a battle between fear and the need to understand what was happening. But no matter how hard he tried, the truth remained out of reach, buried deep in his memory.

Andrés felt more alone than ever, trapped in the darkness of the basement and the darkness of his own mind. He knew he couldn't go on like this, but every attempt to move, to scream, to escape, was futile. He was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, and the hope of finding a way out faded with each flash of light he saw.

It was then that his coworkers, alarmed by a blood-curdling scream that escaped from Andrés' throat and echoed through the entire parking lot, ran to the basement. The sound reverberated off the concrete walls, an echo of pure terror they couldn't ignore. They hurriedly descended the stairs, hearts pounding, fearing the worst. They found Andrés in his car, immobile, his eyes filled with tears and his mouth twisted in a silent, eternal scream. The expression on his face was one of indescribable horror, as if he had seen something beyond comprehension.

They pulled him from the car, his body rigid and trembling, unable to move on his own. Every muscle was tense, as if petrified by fear. The coworkers carried him, whispers of concern and fear filling the air as they quickly took him to the hospital. As they neared the basement exit, the flickering lights seemed to intensify, as if they were bidding Andrés a final, terrifying farewell.

In the hospital, Andrés' condition deteriorated rapidly. He lay in bed, his body weak and exhausted. The room was dimly lit, only illuminated by the cold light of the lamp above the bed. The shadows in the corners seemed to move with a life of their own, heightening the sense of unease. The lights on the lamp began to go out, one LED at a time, each emitting a faint buzz before succumbing to the darkness, all except two, which flickered in a three-beat rhythm each time. Those flashes, so familiar and terrifying, filled him with overwhelming panic. Andrés tried to scream, but no sound came from his mouth. He was trapped in a deafening silence, with only those flashes of light for company. The three blinks were a constant reminder of the horrors he had faced, and of those he could not escape.

Paralysis enveloped him, and every attempt at movement was futile. The truth his mind had refused to release was about to surface, and Andrés knew he couldn't go on like this. He was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, and the hope of finding a way out faded with each flash of light he saw. The two persistent flashes were a beacon of his despair, a symbol of his endless torment.

After the sixteenth blink of the pair of LEDs still lit, a memory flooded Andrés' mind: the federal highway, a dark and silent night, the empty asphalt stretching out before him. The lights of his Volkswagen began to fail, flickering intermittently in three flashes, plunging him into a darkness that seemed to devour everything. Amid the confusion, a dull thud, something that seemed to have come out of nowhere on the side of the road.

The sudden memory of how he avoided stopping while a roadside sign saying "Federal Highway Number 16" passed by. He didn't stop. He never stopped to see if she was okay. He just drovehome in an automated state, his movements mechanical and devoid of emotion. Upon arrival, he inspected the dent on the front of his car, which had been intact until then, where there was a fresh bloodstain. With trembling hands, he cleaned the blood using his favorite sweatshirt, a garment he had worn on so many happy occasions.

He threw the sweatshirt into the trash bin on his block without looking at it twice, as if disposing of it could erase the memory of what had happened. He climbed up to his apartment, each step echoing in the empty stairwell, amplifying the sense of desolation. Entering his room, he collapsed onto the bed, exhausted and disturbed. The weight of what he had done slowly sank into his mind, a heavy burden his conscience tried to reject. His sense of self-preservation swallowed everything that had happened that night, burying it deep in his subconscious.

As this memory surfaced freely for the first time, he lay there, immobile, eyes wide open, staring at the hospital room ceiling while the events of the night played over and over in his mind. The flickering of the hospital lights synchronized with his memories, each flash a reminder of the thud, the fear, and the decision not to stop. The empty road, the dull thud, the road sign... it all blended into a storm of guilt and terror.

The realization of what he had done overwhelmed him, an inescapable truth his mind had tried to suppress for so long. Panic turned into an overwhelming despair, and Andrés felt himself drowning in a sea of remorse.

Andrés suddenly saw from an external perspective the memories of each attempt to start his car, each night. He saw from the outside how, in reality, it was an unconscious root clinging to not let him drive, to read the number 16 on the road each time, translating it into exact minutes of absence of any movement, it was his body trying to avoid the risk of having an accident like the one lodged in his subconscious. His face fixed in the void of the basement, the place where guilt decided to visit him every night, stealthily at first, but blatantly at the end of the terrible episode.

Andrés heard the voices of his coworkers in the distance, worried about how to explain what they had seen to the police waiting in the hallway. The words were a distant echo in his mind, a cacophony of concern and confusion he couldn't fully grasp or understand. He was trapped in his own mind, slowly fading away.

In a final spasm of his body on the hospital bed, Andrés contorted into a strange position, his body twisted at an unnatural but familiar angle. In an overwhelming image, Andrés mirrored the exact position of the woman he had hit. And the sharp memory before falling into the eternal grip of madness from which he would never return: the memory of the rearview mirror showing that contorted figure by the side of Federal Highway 16.

Andrés was lost to madness just as he had entered it, with the image of a body deformed by the impact of a car. But now, remaining in that position in a silent, spasmodic scream to stay in that prison until his last breath.

In his final moment of lucidity, Andrés understood that his mind had created a prison from which he could never escape. Each blink of the lights was a reminder of his unforgivable act, a sign that his spirit was bound to that guilt forever. And so, with the last spark of light fading, Andrés exhaled his final breath, letting the darkness envelop him completely, while saying "sorry."
