I suddenly woke up on a hospital bed,i was confused and unable to remember why i was there:

"Weren't we preparing for a summer trip?" -I thought to myself as i struggled to get up.

I then left the room and started to walk along the empty hallway,and by walking i mean limping,i don't know how or why but my leg felt like it was shattering.

Then i realized the most crucial thing,there was no one around,all chairs were empty along with all rooms and the signs seemed to lead nowhere but back to the room i was. Somehow i wasn't feeling tired of all that walking nor was i hungry but i decided to go back to bed and lay down a bit. After some minutes i started to hear voices,they sounded vaguely familiar but it was very hard to know who was talking.

Then after some moments of thinking i thought to myself once again:

"From what i see it seems like the signs only lead to this room,so what if i go the other direction?" -I asked myself,not knowing if it was even gonna have any result.

After leaving the room i retraced my way and the started going on randoms directions,as if i was entering deeper onto the place. Eventually after a lot of walking i came across a series of hallways all leading to different areas that i assumed it would be the same room i woke up into. So i went straight until something different appeared on the way.

It was hell,as the hallway didn't change at all,making me think i was stuck on some kind of maze,for a moment i stopped and sat near the wall,gathering myself to cry:

"What did i do to deserve this?i never killed anyone,never made someone's life miserable,not even tried to fight for any reason but why am i here? WHY AM I HERE,STUCK ON THIS HELL HOLE?!AM I FOREVER DOOMED TO BE HERE BECAUSE OF SOMETHING I DID THAT INDIRECTLY AFFECTED SOMEONE?!" -I yelled onto the nothing and as expected,got nothing in answer.

I was thinking of "making my way" back to the room but as my eyes opened the hallways changed,they all became red and the signs all changed to "RUN",as i tried to process what was happening on my surroundings i noticed a figure at the "end" of the hallway holding a surgery knife,it seemed like a humanoid wearing a doctor's outfit but it's face was only a grinning smile of sharp teeth spreading across its face ear to ear.

"YOUR TIME IS UP,PATIENT..." -It said on a horrible voice that sounded like an murderer from some 80's horror movie.

"IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO GO,LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND ON THAT!" -It spoke again while flashing the bloody surgery knife.

Then it started to walk on my direction,i was thinking of running but my horribly aching leg wouldn't allow me so i ended up falling and resorting to crawl but it was useless,somehow i got up again and managed to punch it in the face but it seemed to have no effect,i then screamed:

"WHO ARE YOU,WHY AM I HERE AND WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?!" -I screamed at the top of my lungs.

"I am nothing,you are here because of what happened,as for the last question,i'm just doing the best for you" -It said while showing my reflection on the blade.

"W-what are you talking about-" -Before i even managed to say something he yelled.

"WAKE UP CHARLES,WAKE UP!"

I somehow got away from his reach and managed to pull strength to run back to the room while i heard him screaming behind me to "wake up" and just as i opened the door it all got bright.

Next thing i know i woke up on the same room,however i could see the outside through the windo and what seemed to be a woman crying near me.

"Mom,is that...you?" -I tried to ask while feeling mumb.

"Charles,my son,you are finally awaken!" -She saud while tears fell on my arms.

"What happened here?why are we at the hospital-" -And then i remembered what happened.

We were about to go on a summer trip but as we were loading the car i saw a kid playing on the street and a car coming at high speed,i jumped over pushing the kid away and then falling unconscious.Damn it,at least i know everything is ok,except for the fact that when i took off the blanket one of my legs was amputated.

"H-How long has it been like this...?" -I asked with a nervous voice.

"It's been 10 days already,why?"

I tried to explain them about what happened but i decided not to,and i dismissed it as a coma nightmare,although the memories still linger at the back of my mind.
