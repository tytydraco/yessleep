Not long ago, just back in August, I decided to go on a bike ride. I was sitting around in the house for most of the summer, playing street fighter and hyper light breaker in my room. I wasn’t doing *nothing* every day, not exactly, but I still felt like I needed to get out of the house. Besides, it was a nice day outside.

So after sleeping in till about noon, I walked next door and rang the doorbell. My neighbor Terry is way more into riding bikes and going to the gym and that kind of thing than I am. Don’t get me wrong, he’s still the type to play hundreds of hours of elden ring and minecraft in a year, but he’s more on top of staying in shape than me. Not because either of us really needed to, but I guess he does it just as a hobby. 

Anyways, I guess that day he was out of the house. I suddenly remembered that he had an actual summer job - he was probably working at his uncle’s garage, about an hour’s drive north up the highway. His mom came to the door and told me as much. I was over there often, so this was a pretty common thing for her. 

“Oh, hey! He’s working today. He should be back around 9:00 though. I’ll tell him you came by,” she said. 

“Alright! Thanks.”

So I went back over to my garage to get my bike, walking back up through the house, hitting the button to open the garage door, walking back down out the front door, around the house to the garage, pulling out my bike, and ducking under the garage door as it closed (the only button was inside). 

As I rolled out of my driveway, I decided I wanted to go somewhere new. Usually I’d just go around the lake and ride around the bike trail, a few blocks down from the house. That day, though, I decided I wanted to go somewhere new. I turned the wrong way out of my driveway, and after cutting through a different trail, ended up at a shell station about thirty minutes away. Honestly, I already had no idea what part of town I was in, but I knew how to get back, so I wasn’t really lost. I went into the station, talked a bit with the clerk, and bought some bottled water. On my way out the door, I noticed another trail sign out the window of the gas station. 

“Hey, do you know where that goes by any chance?” I asked the clerk, gesturing towards the post with the trail marker on it. 

“I dunno, probably just back around to the lake. Most of these trails connect up somewhere in the woods.” He shrugged. “I’ve never really gone that way though, so don’t take my word for it.” 

I had never been there either, but I figured if it went somewhere sketchy, I’d just turn around and head back. So after about another thirty minutes of riding, the gears on my bike locked up and the pedals stopped turning. The wheels had been clicking for a while, so I figured they probably just got mud or something in them, and I was just going to turn around and walk it back, maybe see if the gas station had a hose or something to wash whatever was stuck in it out with, but as I hopped off my bike and turned around, something caught my eye. 

Off to the side of the trail, there was a metal gate, the kind you see in parking lots occasionally, that section off the road. It didn’t look like it led anywhere, because the only things back here were trees, birds, and dirt paths. Maybe the occasional moose wandering around if you were unlucky. 

So of course I had to explore a little bit. I took out my bike lock and wrapped it around the gate, and just on a whim, decided to walk down past the gate a bit. There wasn’t much. At first glance, you’d think there was nothing back there, but if you paid close attention, you could see where the grass had been flattened and worn down, and there was a thin trail through the woods. I wasn’t sure if it used to be an actual path, or if it was just where some animal had been cutting through the trees, but eventually, it led to a small clearing. There were a few wooden benches and tables, like it was some kind of picnic area at one point. All of them looked a bit rotted and a few of them were knocked over into the grass, which had grown up around them. Clearly, nobody had been here for a long time. 

Again, I was going to just call it there and head back, but I noticed a fence on the other side of the clearing, with a wooden arch and an ornate hanging sign that read “riverside park.” It sounded interesting, and I had never heard of any place in anchorage called that, so I headed through the gateway. 

Come to find out, it was this old botanical garden in the woods. I don’t know when it was built, but it hadn’t been maintained all that well - even just on the path there, flowers were growing all over the ground and out of their planters, and a tree had grown so far over the path that I had to walk around the side of it just to keep going. The paths were cobbled together from a bunch of different types of rocks, and they were so overgrown that they were a bit hard to follow sometimes. Eventually though, I found something cool: one of the paths had these little carved plaques on a lot of the rocks, with different names and dates and stuff like that. My guess is that they were the names of people who had donated to keep the place going, at some point. I remember they stopped at 1956, with some guy named Edward Walsh. 

It was a pretty nice place, all in all. There were all kinds of cool trees and flowers, and it did in fact have a river running through part of it, with this fancy wooden bridge crossing over it. It was hard to see very far though; there were a lot of posts with planters hanging from them along the paths, and as nice as they probably looked at one point, most of them were just filled with dead vines, reaching all the way down to the ground and blocking the view. I walked around for a bit, and I found a big stone fountain in what I guess must’ve been the middle of the place. It had these two stone birds carved into the top of it, looking up at the sky with their beaks open, where the water probably used to come down from at one point. The side of the fountain had a huge crack in it, and there wasn’t water in it anymore. My guess is the water froze and broke open the side of it over the winter. What was still in it though, was coins. A lot of them; quarters, pennies, even some old gold ones, shining brightly in the sun. 

So I did what anybody in my situation would do, and I pocketed all the really shiny, valuable looking ones. It’s not like it was even much of a fountain anymore, anyways. 

Maybe I’m just really unlucky.  

Anyways, as I was walking back across the bridge, it started raining. I started running back to where I thought my bike was, but I got lost and ended up just staying under this little wooden bus-stop looking thing. Just a little rest spot by the path. I meant to call my mom and tell her about where I was at, since this seemed like exactly the kind of place she’d love, but right at that moment, I noticed something.

A little ways down the path, there was this guy. It was sort of hard to make him out through the rain, but it looked like he was wearing this long, black trenchcoat, with a dark hood over his head. Now normally I’d have said something, but then I remembered I was in the middle of nowhere in the woods, and that whoever this guy was, he was either A), homeless, or B), some weirdo who hangs out deep in the woods on Monday afternoons. Ignoring the fact that I technically also fell into that second category, I decided to hide behind the little bus-stop-thingy as he passed by on the path. I was too scared to follow him, because I didn’t want him to see me. But I did notice one thing, the guy was *tall*. Not like, *slenderman* tall, but a good 6’8 or so. His hands looked pale and bony. And he was carrying what looked like a wide, double-edged knife.

So yeah, I definitely wasn’t going to attract any attention from this guy if I could help it. I watched as he kept walking until he eventually disappeared into the rain, and then stepped out from behind the wall of the little canopy and started walking in the opposite direction. 

The path was muddy and wet, and more than a few times my shoes felt like they were stuck to the ground. I decided I was going to go find a tree or something to stand under and call my mom, maybe see if I could figure out where I was on google maps or something. 

Instead of a tree though, I ended up at what looked like a gift shop. It was still in pretty decent condition compared to a lot of the place, and the roof seemed mostly intact, so I pushed my way inside the front door. There was a little bell attached to it that dinged when I finally got the door open, which startled me a bit. It wasn’t a very big shop, just one room that was mostly made of wood, with a thick, stiff-feeling carpet covering the creaky floor. It looked like the place had been mostly cleaned out; the only things left on the shelves were a few small, sad looking beanie babies and some outdated books about gardening. There was still a map of the garden hanging up on the wall behind the counter though, which I took a photo of. I was still back behind the counter trying to find cell service when I heard the bell on the door ring. 

I ducked under that thing faster than I’ve probably ever moved in my life. “Surely this man couldn’t have crossed the entire garden that fast”, I thought.  It hadn’t even been 20 minutes since I saw him going the other way. But sure enough, there was a ding. A short pause, and then the floor creaked. A shadow passed over the counter. I could see it moving against the wall, his head swiveling, scanning the room, as if he knew I was there. I held my breath and stayed as still as the statues in the garden. Heavy footsteps fell on the carpet as it walked around the room. First it went to the shelf with the stuffed animals. It walked around it to the books,then  to the locked door of the bathroom. It paused for a moment, then it rattled the handle. Then it came to the counter. It stood there, for a long, long time. And then I heard it tap on the wood just above me. A loud, hard sound that made me gasp out loud. I tried to cover my mouth with my hand, and for a moment, I thought he hadn’t heard me. 

There was a split second of silence, and then a bony hand shot down over the counter and grabbed my wrist, harshly yanking me up over the counter. It held me up off the ground, so that I was face to face with this thing. Its face looked like some kind of animal’s skull, or maybe one of those plague doctor masks. It was hard to tell in the dark room, and I don’t know which would be worse anyways. And it’s not like that’s what I was worried about anyways at the time. I was busy kicking and shouting at the man, the creature, whatever it was, to try and get it to drop me, but it barely flinched. It just shook me as hard as it could by the wrist. The coins I had stolen from the fountain rattled around, and the creature paused, staring me in the eyes for a moment. It put its free hand in the pocket of my jacket and ripped it from the seams, watching as the coins and fabric clattered to the ground. It looked back up at me again, for a long, drawn out moment. Then It let go of my wrist, dropping me to the ground, and as I stood there, dumbfounded, it reached out and roughly pushed me towards the door. The message was clear enough. I left as fast as I could, running through the mud and rain until I ran out of breath

My bike was still there when I got back, and I think the rain must’ve helped wash out whatever was stuck in the gears, because it seemed to suddenly be working fine again. I got back to the gas station, and talked with the clerk again.

“Man, you're drenched,” he laughed. “Did you figure out where that trail went?”

“Yeah, it just loops back to the lake.”
