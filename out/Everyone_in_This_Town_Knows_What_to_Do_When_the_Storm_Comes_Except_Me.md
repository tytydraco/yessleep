I thought getting lost in a grocery store was the worst thing that could happen. Then the speakers warned us that the storm had set in.

I disliked visiting a new store. Why was every structure so different? It’s almost like they wanted you to get lost.

I moved to this town a few weeks ago.

The people were hard to understand. Everyone seemed cold and unwelcoming. When I tried to talk to them, they either ignored me or replied in one-word answers and turned away.

Luckily, I managed to persuade my sister to visit that weekend, so I had someone to talk to.

I missed her the most.

Since we were children, we haven’t been apart from each other this long.

The speakers in the store crackled.

Probably some stupid child got lost again. Why can’t parents pay attention to them?

“Attention shoppers, we have received reports of the beings appearing in the library and community hall. Please hide away and stay put. The storm has fully set in. Do not look at them! This is not a drill.”

What? Was this some stupid prank?

Then it sounded through the speakers again, but louder.

There was some muffling around the store.

I continued my shopping.

As I walked down the aisle, people were sitting on the ground, hunched over. Their faces were filled with terror, eyes wide open, shaking. Some of them were crying.

A chill ran down my spine.

Did so many adults get spooked by some dumb high school prank?

Another aisle. A man hunched next to the shelf. When he saw me calmly walking, he looked around, grunted, and then swiftly made his way towards me.

“Hey, hey, what the fuck are you doing? Are you out of your mind?”

His voice sounded pedantic and annoying.

“What are you talking about? I’m just doing my shopping.”

“Your shopping?!”

He grabbed my shirt and pulled me down to the ground.

I wrestled out of his grip and tried to stand up again. He pulled me back down, gripping my shirt harder.

“Hey fucking let go!”

Then a strange sound echoed through the store. Like metal getting pressed together. Then loud rhythmic thumps.

“What was….”

“Shhh, shhh, shut up, shut up.”

He pulled me lower to the shelf, looking around, his eyes widened with terror.

Faint cries came from one of the aisles next to us.

The rhythmic thumping got louder. Then a roar, sounding like a hungry polar bear. A woman started screaming.

Shock ran down my spine.

Her screams got more frantic, cries like a person being tortured. They slowly died out into a gurgling silence.

Then a sound of sloppy chewing.

Something was thrown from the aisle. A splash of blood flew before my eyes.

Food came up my throat.

“We need to go,” the man mouthed and pointed behind the aisle. He grabbed my hand, but I tried to fight him again.

His face was twisted in frustration.

Then another scream.

The man’s hand started shaking.

He looked me up and down and started to crouch away.

Soon, the thumps got closer.

My hands went numb.

I looked back and quickly caught up to the man.

He pulled us into the staff room.

We quickly hid behind a baking container.

“What the fuck was that?”

“Shh, shh, you need to be quieter.”

“What’s going on?” I whispered.

“It’s the creatures.”

“The storm…”

He swallowed. “They take whoever they notice.”

He pointed at the window.

The outside was dark. Huge black clouds gathered in the sky, and lightning flashed and struck the ground hard. There was an eye inside the storm with huge winds blowing around it.

“Don’t look at it too long; once they see you, it’s over.”

“A few years ago, I lost a son to the storm. He was no older than you are now.”

He was holding back tears.

My whole world was spinning.

I sat on the ground, holding my head, rocking back and forth.

“Hey, kid, you need to get yourself together!”

A scream came from somewhere in the staff room.

The man started frantically looking around.

There was a small shelf behind us.

He grabbed me and shoved me in.

“Don’t make a fucking noise, okay.”

My heart was beating out of my chest.

“No, no, no!”

The man let out agonizing screams.

Then only faint cries.

A wet, tearing sound.

Holding a hand over my mouth, I tried not to scream.

Then I could see the doors to the shelf breaking.

I closed my eyes and started screaming.

Something pulled me out and threw me on the ground, almost knocking me unconscious.

Strange forces started tearing at my limbs first through the clothing, then through my skin, my flesh, and into my bones.

The pressure was so hard I could feel my bones on the brink of breaking.

I tried to move my body around, but I couldn’t get out of the creature's hold.

Memories of my sister flashed before my eyes.

Then the speakers came on again.

“Attention shoppers, the storm has passed. The creatures are gone. Please resume your shopping activities.”

The pressure was gone.

My body lay on the floor in a pool of its blood.

Then footsteps.

The face of a teenager no older than 19 holding a mop in his hand.

“Hey, mister, you can’t be back here. You need to get out.”

“Wha…?”

“You need to leave!”

He dragged me out.

I barely got to my feet; they were still in so much pain.

“The exit’s there,” he snapped his fingers and looked at me, annoyed.

I stumbled out still bleeding.

Outside were workers mopping up the blood and stuffing what was left of the bodies in a black trash bag.

Other people were walking around with their shopping carts, acting like nothing had happened, with the same dull, cold look they always had.

Everyone stared at me like I was a crazy person. They averted their gaze whenever I tried to make eye contact with them.

In the parking lot, there were paramedics dispatched. They quickly rushed me in and analyzed my wounds. They sew them up and put gauze around them.

They didn’t ask what happened. They didn’t ask my name.

I tried to speak to them too, but they wouldn’t answer. Once they were done, they pushed me out of the ambulance and pointed at my car.

I don’t think I’ve ever felt this alone.

For a while, I lay on the backseat of my car crying profusely.

When I mustered up the courage, I drove myself home.

The days were a blur. I lay on my couch, barely able to get off it.

Then today came. My sister just called me to say that she’ll be at my place in an hour.

I tried to pull myself off the couch to at least take a shower.

Memories of us playing in our backyard rushed to my mind.

I smiled for the first time in days.

Edit: She should have been here 15 minutes ago.

The storm clouds are forming again.
