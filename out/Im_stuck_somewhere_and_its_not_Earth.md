It was a ferry trip around the shore of Lake Ontario.

Busy with the city life, I devoted this Saturday to reimburse with nature. Specifically, the water, which I could never experience as a child for reasons I don't have to explain here. All the ferries along the Upstate shoreline were expensive, but one seemed oddly cheap.

"GARRET LAKEFRONT TOURS - An experience you'll keep coming back for!"

A ticket was three dollars. Hundreds of reviews at a 4.1 star rating. The photos showed a pristine and upkept ferry service with an extensive network of docks and a bright white office.

With an already tight wallet, who wouldn't?

I drove over, fleeing city limits into suburbs and eventually grasslands and forests. The landscape around the ferry seemed eerily deserted, but just like the website photos, it all felt modern and civil.

I first noticed something wrong with the vendor. His smile seemed too cheery, he was almost instant. I just considered it part of the service in coastal towns. Hell, might be more typical than that harbor ice cream parlor I was at when I was a kid. Gave me nightmares for days.

I did notice people spread about the piers, so at least there was activity. They all seemed really quiet, but it was best to leave them to their business and enjoy the scene. The whole place was tucked into a square-like valley, trees lining the neat side hills. I stepped onto the ferry, a medium-sized metal boat that might have been for fishing once, and we set sail.

About thirty minutes into the tour, my phone stopped registering images. Now there's a weather report for low visibility. Eventually, it gets worse. Within an hour(at least I think that's how much time passed) the phone was essentially unuseable. Waves became more violent as the boat rocked back and forth.

I get a glimpse of the control room. Screens are just bright colors, the man is adjusting control knobs and levers at inhuman speeds, radar is just turning back and forth. Weird shit's going down now.

"Hello?" I said to the man in the chair. He didn't speak.

"Are we going to be alright?"

He begins to turn towards me. Everything about him was right. His blue flannel, his short combed hair, dark overalls. But his face was wrong. Teeth that shone like a waxing cresent, sides perched up. Just like the vendor.

*"*Of course...*"*

Then I blacked out. Fast forward god knows how long.

I woke up on a beach of brown silt and scattered stones, face down. I'm gasping for breath, trying to clean myself from the damp sand, but once that's over with I look up and see the new reality I was in. The skies are stormy and dark, it's just trees along the rift. No buildings, no boat. Just me and the waves. There is no tranquility here for me.

The humidity was horrible. There's a light drizzle in the air, so i'm already rushing to find something like a trail or a hut, anything. I must have spent a good twenty minutes running around like a headless chicken before I remembered about my phone.

After a minute of frusturatingly tampering with it, the screen finally turns on.

*"ohmygodthankyousomuch."*

That relief was short lived when I began to notice what situation I was in. For starters, the time was now at 7:48 RM, and the sun was already below the horizon, which was bad because I don't assume that they have night patrols across the entire shore. For christ sakes we could have landed in Canada. Well, *I*. *Where the hell is that captain anyway?*

I began scrolling around on my phone. Maps is gone, and the date is now Syr 3. I was never too keen on social media so I only had Reddit. Oddly enough, there is wifi, but it's a real pain in the ass trying to type this right now.

I continued to walk around, weather and light not getting any better. The drizzle stops but the silence feels deafening. The landscape is linear in a way where nothing really seems to change, even the pattern of rocks. To pass the time, I begin kicking a few pebbles. When I stop because my feet begin to hurt, the noises didn't stop.

I look around and notice a strange shape poking out of the water off the shoreline. Might be a mile but my flight adrenaline kicks in when I register that *it's dragging towards the shoreline.*

I make a run for the tree line. As I scale a bunch of rocks and muddy tallgrass I glimpse back and it almost seems faster than ever. There is a noise in the air. It's faint, and it might not even be connected to the thing, but it sure as hell dosen't sound human.

Now I have to deal with dodging incoming trees, roots and branches on the ground, and some eldritch being behind me? My mind is just going full panic mode.

Three minutes feel like eternity when your life depends on it. I must have crossed several acres and climbed past a ravine by the time I reach a break in the trees. Thinking that I was safe was a grave mistake. I trip, tumble down a gradual hill, and i'm on the floor. I writhered like a fish gasping for it to be returned to the water.

*Damnit. Think I twisted an ankle.* I thought to myself.

Getting up was a futile effort due to the sheer pain. I had to start crawling. I don't think that *thing* can walk on land but I can still hear the noises. Sometimes it sounds like deranged chanting, sometimes nothing makes sense. I just can't stop even if my body tells me to. I have to keep moving forward.

I prayed and something responded. The tallgrass was beginning to thin and I could make out the yellow markings on the rugged and cracked asphalt.

"Holy shit, i'm alive!"

I never thought i'd get so excited about finding a road.

Knowing this area, i'll be back to civilization in five minutes...

In *ten* minutes...

In *thirty* minutes...

There's nothing. I say it in disappointment then I say it in anger. Again and again and again. I hit my hands off the tarmac, bruising them further, which is a pretty crappy idea when one of them started to bleed.

I pulled out the phone. Forty percent or so left. I try texting numbers, calling numbers, first with parents, then friends, even blocked numbers. I was willing to use every chance.

For the twentieth or so time:

*"The recipient you are reaching cannot be contacted at this time."*

Rundown. *Ankle: swelling. Body: exhausted. Help: none. Me: pissed.*

I had to flee to the forest again, the terrain becoming more gradual or so here. I eventually came upon an old dugout made of all kinds of earth and crudely arranged sticks. There's a dried stain of something across the ground and the back wall. Little plastic colorful wrappers. I honestly have no idea.

This is my only shot on ever contacting the outside world again. The signal is dropping. DO NOT ever go to Garret Lakefront Tours. Call the cops. I wasn't the first here, but hopefully i'm the last. I'm hungry, thirsty, but most of all i'm scared. Tell my close ones I love them, even if we had tough times recently.

If I survive any longer, I'll try to update you guys. There's a damn good chance I'm the only thing here to help me. I'm going to try and rest here. If you have any questions or advice please let me know.
