I am at my wits end here. I have no idea how or why things are happening to me and the people around me. It's escalating and I'm scared of what is going to happen next. The only thing I can think of doing is write everything down and hope whatever is happening does not spread if it's written text.



I guess I should give some context, so things makes sense. The first weird occurrence happened around a month ago. In my city we have a unique news segment that is hosted on its own channel. They have their own little news bit that they do once every other day. I know it's popular with retired folk in my city but that's beside the point. My girlfriend loves watching it for some reason and like any good partner I had to indulge her wanting to sit down together for it.



I remember that first time clearly. There were this elderly gentlemen that always spoke with a gentle voice, hair like snow we have to contend with six months out of the year. The old man was standing in front of our cities' river that cleaves the city center in half. I don't remember exactly what he was talking about but in the middle of his speech he kind of froze up. I remember that part clearly. He froze up and looked into the camera and said.



"Burning human flesh smells so appetizing."



Then he just blinked and continued talking about whatever point he was making. That was the first time I noticed or came into contact with whatever this thing is. At the time I remember looking at my girlfriend. She seemed as stunned as I felt. I remember saying something to the effect of.



"What the fuck?"

  
I remember her laughing at the time. She has a weird sense of humor. Or had- I guess. Fuck. I have to write it all down here. Maybe writing it down helps.

  
Anyway, that was the first time. After that it started happening to people around me. I think it was a day or two later, a coworker of mine just looked at me in between repetitions when we were at the gym together. I asked him what was wrong. He didn't say a thing but just stared at me for like a solid thirty seconds. Beyond, you know, what is socially reasonable. Then he went back to lifting dumbbells. I asked him what was going on and why he stared at me like that but he didn't seem to remember that and looked at me like I was the crazy one.

  
All of this is messing with my mind. I feel like I'm insane and going crazy you know. There are small ones, like this one with my coworker, where it's ambiguous. I don't know if that is the weird thing happening. But then there are like the big ones. 

  
My girlfriend and I were invited over to my parents place two weeks ago now. We were supposed to help make dinner together. I was helping cut vegetables and the others were setting the table, boiling the pasta. You know, those kinds of things. The weird thing that happened was my mom turned and told my girlfriend to kill herself. I yelled at her but she didn't seem to remember saying that. I know my mom would never tell anyone to kill themselves. She is the sweetest lady in the world. 

  
I think this fucked up thing is happening to me as well. A week ago I was talking with my girlfriend. You know small stuff, how was your day sweetie. That kind of thing. She got this weird look in her eye.



"Why would you say that?" she asked me. Very confrontational. I have no idea what happened. We were just talking. I don't remember saying or doing anything weird but I believe her. After I said whatever I had just said, I apologized to her. Maybe it is paradoxical but I trust her. I trust her when she accused me of telling her something horrible. Up until that point, I had never experienced not being able to trust my own senses. 

  
Five days ago I hit my girlfriend. We were talking about each other's childhoods. I was in the middle of reminiscing when I blinked or skipped. I don't know how to describe it. In a blink I was standing over my girlfriend. My right hand was throbbing and she was bleeding. I have no idea what happened. She wouldn't let me near her. I apologized profusely. I remember begging her to let me help her with the bleeding. We went to the hospital that night. 

  
I thought my life was over that night. That I would get a police report, taken to jail. All of that. I sat in the emergency room while she saw the doctor or the nurses. Those few hours she was being tended to, were the longest and most agonizing hours of my life. I was constantly expecting police officers or security to come and arrest me. But they never did. In hindsight, I don't think my girlfriend told them what had happened. 



She came back and we were allowed to leave. She had received a couple of stitches on her left cheek and had been administered painkillers. Before driving home we stopped by a convenience store to buy some ice packs. There was a big commotion in the back of the store when we left. The next day the newspapers said that two people had been killed that store.

  
Three days ago my girlfriend disappeared. I have no idea what happened. I woke up and she was not on her side of the bed. She's always been a heavy or deep sleeper. I basically have to act as her alarm in the morning. All her stuff was still on the nightstand, phone and wallet. She was just gone, I panicked. I called her mom, asking if they knew where she was. They had no idea but would contact me if they found her. I think they started looking on their own. I skipped work that day, went to the police station to file a report. Missing persons report or whatever it's called. One of the police officers was being weird, he had that thing happens when I was in the middle of recounting my last few days for their report. I don't know what to call it. He told me to kill my girlfriend, to dismember her. The other officer didn't react at all to his colleagues' statement. It's getting worse. It's spreading. Whatever the fuck this is. 

  
Yesterday I fled from another human being for the first time. I'm a wreck. I constantly worry about my girlfriend. She's still missing and I have no idea what has happened to her or where she is. I've been searching all over our small city, racking my brain trying to search every spot we've ever been together. I haven't been getting much sleep the last few days and out of desperation I went to church. Not many people are religious in our city, most people are agnostic or atheistic. But I went, I sat down and just started praying out loud. A priest approached me from the other end of the aisle. I couldn't handle hearing a priest say vile things. That a priest would be affected by whatever this thing is. I just stood up and ran. I ran as fast as I could away from him. Paranoia is settling in. I've tried calling my parents but they haven't picked up. None of my friends from outside the city are answering their phones. 

  
I don't know what to do. I don't know what I can do. I don't know. Please. Help.
