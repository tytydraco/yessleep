A few days before graduating high school I started hearing a train. If you’ve ever lived in the Midwest or near a train then you know the kinds of noises they make, usually you only hear the horn as it goes by. This train is different. There’s something wrong with the whistle. Every night it changes. Some nights it sounds like someone screaming in agony. Some nights it’s the cry of a mother losing her child.

This post is a collection of my diary entries from my graduation to now. I’m posting this because I’m not in control of me anymore and I need someone to see this maybe even understand.

It's been months since this started and I can’t take it anymore. Night after night after night of screaming in my ears. Night after night of dreading when the train will come. I need it to end. I need it to stop.

High school is officially over! I can’t believe I’m finally done. It’s been a long four years that I thought would never end. I’m hoping that college will be a lot better than high school. I’m going to make new friends, party, and be somewhere that’s not here. As excited as I am to graduate, I keep feeling this weird feeling in my stomach. I’m not fully sure what it is. Probably just nervous about graduation. All the seniors got our caps and gowns back in May. On the last day of finals week Janine and I could not stop crying. I know we’ll see each other over the summer but it still sucks that she’s going to California for school. Honestly, I’m incredibly jealous of her. I mean how beautiful is California!? We both worked today so we didn’t get to hangout, but we did make plans to hang out before graduation. We are going to get ready and take pictures together before the ceremony. I’m so excited!!

Something weird happened last night. I heard the train go by, like normal, but this time it sounded wrong. I don’t know how to explain it, when it came by the horn made an odd sort of whispering sound. Maybe the horn was just broken but I can’t stop thinking about it.

Anyway, I’ve already got my dress picked out for graduation! It’s a gorgeous white dress with ruffles on the bottom. Mom’s also letting me borrow her pearl earrings! I’m so excited.

It’s been about a month since I last wrote but the last month has been so so busy. Janine and I have been hanging out as much as we can, which has been difficult with both of us working. I’m at Mr. Sorbets scooping ice cream. It’s not a bad job but I keep seeing people I know, and I hate serving people I know. Janine got a job as a lifeguard at the pool, so our schedules are all over the place. Mostly we’ve just been hanging out at each other’s house. Last week we got lunch and then drove around for a couple of hours. It was perfect.

I’ve started the process of packing for college! I went to the store with mom and dad, and we got a whole bunch of stuff for my dorm room. We got important stuff like bowls, plates, silverware, etc. I want the dorm room to feel homey, so we got a rug and some bedding. I also got a bunch of posters for the walls. I’m incredibly excited and stressed at the same time.

The train has been bothering me all summer. Last night the horn was as loud as it’s always been, but it still sounded off. The sound it made started normal and then morphed into something that sounded like metal scraping across metal. I’ve never heard a train whistle sound like that. It almost makes me want to go to the tracks just to see what’s wrong with the train. It doesn’t really matter it just odd.

I’m almost completely done packing, all that I have left now are my clothes. Classes start on the 19^(th,) and I move in on the 13^(th) for some freshman activities. I can’t wait anymore for the thirteenth to get here. Two weeks ago, the train started getting louder. Not just the whistle, the entire train. I can hear it coming 30 minutes before it even passes the house. The worst part is the train passing by. The sounds fill my head consuming my thoughts and leaving me deaf to the rest of the world. I can’t scream. I can’t breathe. Then it just disappears like nothing happened.

I tried to talk to my mom about the train, but it didn’t go well. All she said was “The train? Sweetheart there’s nothing wrong with the train. It’s the same as it’s always been.”

Every time I’ve tried to bring it up since she changes the subject to college and asks what else I need. Maybe that’s what it is. Stress. I’m stressed out and I just want to leave.

The first day of classes are done! Honestly, it was rather boring, which I wasn’t expecting. My professors just went over the syllabus and talked about assignments. It was good to have an easy day though. Everything is going well with my roommate Emily. We don’t see each other much but we get along. The food here isn’t the best but at least it’s edible. Last week the University had a bunch of free stuff students could do and we had freshman orientation. I met a lot of cool people and had a few late nights. So far, my expectations have been lived up to!

The best thing about college so far has been not hearing that stupid train. I stopped hearing it my first night here! I Slept the best I ever have. The only issue I’m having is that I can’t stop thinking about the train. Every night as I’m falling asleep, I start to think I hear it and then it fades.

I woke up next to some tracks last night. I had no idea where I was or how I got there. I know I went to sleep in my bed, I know it! When I woke up my pajamas were stained with mud and grass. I attempted to stand but my legs started shaking and I barely managed to make it all the way up before collapsing.

“How did I get here?” I asked myself starting sobbed. I sat for a while sobbing, feeling so out of control. After a little while I told myself that I had sleepwalked out here. I’ve never done anything like this before, but it was the only rational conclusion I could come to. That’s when I noticed the tracks.

The wood on the tracks was rotting the grass around growing so tall almost covering the tracks. The metal of the tracks so rusted and worn down that it was hard to tell if it was metal at all. I couldn’t stop staring at the tracks. No matter how hard I tried to look away or how long I closed my eyes something would pull my gaze back to the tracks. I needed to run or crawl in any direction away from the tracks, but I couldn’t. My whole being just sat watching the tracks.

Someone found me. I don’t remember who or how, but they did. All I remember about them was them telling me the tracks have been out of service for thirty years and that they had been used to carry things in and out of the nearby city. Eventually they called 911 and I was taken to the hospital. At some point during the ride to the hospital the ambulance sirens started to sound a lot like the train.

I’ve tried to ignore it. To move on with my life but I can’t. Every god damn night I hear that haunting whistle. The shriek as it passes by my window night after night. While I do homework. While I sleep. While I call my mom it’s there outside of my window yelling at me, calling to me.

After I got out of the hospital my parents wanted me to come. “Sweetheart we’re worried about you” my mom said to me and I blew her off. Told her “It wouldn’t happen again” and “I’ll take better care of myself.” I tried to stay true to my word. I bought noise cancelling headphones and they worked for a while until I started hearing the whistle in my head.

I can’t ignore it anymore. Everyday that I push the thoughts of the whistle and its train out of my mind the sinking feeling in my stomach grows. The train is the only thing that will stop it. I’m done. It won. If it wants me then it can have me. I don’t know what it will do and I don’t know why it’s been pushing me towards it but it’s out of my control.
