Last night I heard a train whistle from outside, I heard it again tonight. This time it was much closer. The thing is… I don’t live near a train station.

Maybe I should start from the beginning before I get into the details. I live in a relatively small town. It’s nice enough, the people are friendly more or less, but it’s not really close to anything important. We’re more like a stop on the way for those on a road trip, and looking for a cheap place to lay their heads for the night. What I’m getting at is, there is definitely no train station here, or anywhere near here. I think the closest one is probably four or five counties away at a minimum. The best route of transportation in and out of town for us here is a crumbling and pot hole-filled main road that needs to be re-paved. Speaking of the main road, I work just off of it at the motel. It’s the dead of winter right now so we haven’t had a customer in at least three weeks. I work the graveyard shift which I think most people would hate, but I don’t mind it. Everything is so quiet, especially now in the winter time. My boss would kill me if she found out, but sometimes I’ll plug in the space heater in the main lobby and open the window just to hear the absolute silence outside.

It was on one of those very nights that I first heard it. I probably wouldn’t have even noticed it if I hadn’t been so focused on the complete lack of sound. But there it was. The sound of a train whistle. It sounded so incredibly far away that I almost payed it no mind. I thought that it was odd, but I waved it off as a strange truck horn or something like that. The rest of the night passed without incident. That was about one month ago. I heard it again four nights later, but this time it seemed considerably closer. Two distinct train whistles ringing clear as day, and then back to silence. I asked my boss the next morning if she knew about any railroads being built nearby, but she hadn’t. Everywhere I looked had no information on any railroads being established, so that was a dead end.

It only took two more nights before I heard it again. This time there was no question, the sound was definitely closer. I tried to pull my phone out to record it but I was just a bit too slow. I decided to set up a recorder at the window, so that at least I had some proof that I was hearing this phantom train. Three nights later I finally got what I was looking for. Closer and clearer than it had been before was the distinct whistle of the train. I immediately downloaded the footage to my computer and listened back. To my delight, you could hear the whistle clearly.

The next morning I excitedly loaded up the video to show to my boss. When the train whistle sounded I looked to her to see what she thought, but she wore the same expression on her face as before the video had started. She asked me when she was going to hear this supposed train. I played it back again but got the same reaction. She couldn’t hear it. I thought that maybe her ears were going and she couldn’t hear the frequency or something, so I showed it to my best friend. Same thing. Nobody but me can hear that damn train.

I’ll be honest, I didn’t take that very well. I thought I was going crazy or something, had my night shifts and lack of sleep finally caused me to crack? I took a few days off which was really no problem, seeing as there were no customers. I figured that a couple good nights of rest in my own bed at home would do me some good. Plus I live in the opposite direction of the train noises, so that was a plus.

I didn’t even get a full night of sleep in my own home before I was awoken by the whistle. I shot straight up in bed. There was no way that I could’ve just heard it, now even closer than before. It sounded like at this point it was half-way to the edge of town. I told myself that it was just a nightmare and tried to go back to sleep, but I knew that wasn’t the case.

The next day I went to the local library to try and find any records of a railroad existing in the town. At this point I was desperate for an explanation. I was even willing to believe in a ghost train if it explained the sound plaguing my nights. But I found absolutely nothing. No records, no photos, just… nothing. I even started scouring the nearby woods looking for any sign at all of train tracks, but there was nothing there either. I think that I was starting to act a little crazy, because my best friend seemed nervous, and kept asking me if I had gotten enough sleep. I lied and said I was fine, which was of course untrue.

This cycle went on for days. Every night now, the train would get closer. I tried sleeping at friends houses, I even tried sleeping in a god damn tent and nearly froze to death, but still the train grows ever closer. I went back to work. My boss seemed hesitant for me to come back, but I told her it was fine. I have tried absolutely everything I could think of at this point, but I’m out of options. The snowstorms are so bad right now that I can’t even drive out of town. There’s no escaping. I can’t sleep at night, or even in the daytime, because every waking moment I’m worried I’ll hear that familiar sound.

The reason I started writing this post by saying that I heard a train outside last night, was that it was literally right outside. Tonight when I heard it again, it was the first time that I could feel the rumbling of the metallic wheels on tracks, rumbling throughout this small motel. I’m writing this now, because I don’t think that it could get any closer to me without me seeing it… without it hitting me. Tomorrow night if I hear it again… I worry that it will be the last time. I hope with everything that I have left that I am just crazy, finally losing my mind. But there’s a feeling deep within my chest that is eating away at me... Last night I heard a train whistle from outside, I heard it again tonight, and I will hear it again tomorrow.
