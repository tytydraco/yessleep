I have no idea how one would explain dreaming to a child.

You close your eyes and see, hear, smell, taste, and feel a world, seemingly just as concrete and complex as waking reality, yet you alone are there to witness.

How do you tell them that what they experienced did not really happen, cannot be measured, tested, or proven.

I imagine the word “subjective” means precious little at that age.

I can’t remember how or if it was ever explained to me. It didn’t stick if it was. I knew my dreams were more than my resting mind making sense of static cognitive noise.

I knew it the first time I saw something watching the girl next door.

I did not have a bad upbringing in any way. I had loving parents who provided a comfortable, stimulating life for me and my younger brother. We had vast wilderness to explore, a close community of townsfolk, and the most breathtaking view of the sunset from the roof of our two-story log house.

When we were small, it felt less like a house and more like a castle, or an impenetrable fortress.

The house stood broad and stoic at the edge of the forest, built from thick, honey-colored timber that had darkened with age and weather. The roof sloped steeply, shingled in overlapping wooden tiles, and a narrow window was set just beneath its peak, perfectly placed for climbing out onto its surface.

Traditional artwork from my culture was carved into its varnished frame, some much older than me, some I carved myself, tethering past and present through the body of wood. Stonework outlined the base of the structure, vines and moss traced the corners and crevices, softening the lines of the architecture so that it bled seamlessly into the surrounding wilderness.

The windows were tall and narrow, their glass slightly warped with age and heat, catching and scattering light in a way that decorated the interior with a vibrant mystical glow when the sun hit it right.

To a child, it felt solid and safe, like a monument that had stood since the dawn of creation, and would still be standing long after everything else had crumbled away. A fixed structure in a world that was fractured and uncertain.

I had everything required for a beautiful childhood, and yet I still found myself counting down the seconds until I could run to my bed and close my eyes.

One night, like many others, I sat at the dinner table with my brother, my mother, and my father, eagerly stuffing my face with mashed potatoes and mutton, tearing at the meat like a wild beast. Da watched me with a grin of amusement while Ma tried to ignore the violent display.

Unsurprisingly, I was the first to finish my meal, and like every night, I inhaled sharply to speak, but Ma preemptively waved a hand with a resigned sigh and a reluctant smile before I could ask to be excused.

I sprinted up the staircase, into my bedroom, and out the window onto the roof. From there, I watched the orange and pink remnants of the sun’s influence fade from the sky as night settled over the town below. I sat with my hands resting back against the house, it felt alive, heat radiating off of it after the long hours of daylight.

A warm, gentle wind brushed my face and slipped down my neck, sending chills along my arms, as if the earth itself were granting me permission to rest, and kissing me goodnight.

I climbed back through my window and into my bed, lying atop the covers as the breeze circulated the room around me. I closed my eyes as the last traces of outside light disappeared.

I don’t remember how the conversation went when I first told my parents about my dreams. I imagine they dismissed my stories as a child’s creativity filling the empty gaps in time that a quiet town like ours provided. That was a logical response. They had no way of knowing. I don't blame them for what happened, but it’s hard not to wonder how different things could’ve been had they listened when I told them I could leave my body while it slept.

For as long as I can remember, my dreams have felt just as real as my waking life. When I let sleep take my body, my mind always remained fully aware. I would say that the majority of my childhood memories, the clear ones anyway, are ones that took place when I was navigating the corners of my unconscious brain.

It began with vast, complex dreamscapes that I could control with thought alone. Entire universes at a young boy’s command. I spoke with heroes from my novels, fought monsters, soared through the sky and into distant galaxies, but I knew even at that age that those worlds were constructions of my own imagination.

A great deal of my time was spent thinking in those places. Hours contemplating, talking to myself, and engaging with the residents of my subconscious. I sometimes wonder now how all that extra time to myself affected my development at such a young age.

I didn’t know it was strange that the amnestic properties of sleep had no hold on me. I didn't know that others lost awareness during those hours of deep rest. And I didn’t know I was unique when I became aware of something else while I dreamed.

As I sat within my dream, thinking, focusing, simply existing, I became gradually aware of my physical body. I tried to feel the texture of the blankets against my skin, my hair resting on my forehead, and my heavy eyelids sealing me inside my mind. As I focused, I realized I could create distance between myself and those sensations.

I wasn’t moving within the dimensions of my dream, nor was I moving my real body, but I knew I was moving somehow.

Then I noticed another sensation. A faint warmth, a gentle humming or vibration. It began in my fingertips. As I concentrated on it, the feeling spread through my hands, my forearms, and eventually my entire body.

I knew I was onto something. I stripped my dream of its features, not wanting to waste any concentration maintaining it. I floated in the empty void of my mind as the humming intensified. I felt resistance, like an ocean's current firmly pushing back against me, until the shadows of my consciousness began to melt away and take shape.

A bookshelf.

A window.

A strip of golden fairy lights along a polished, tan ceiling.

I was in my room, floating weightlessly. The unknown force that was pushing against me having given up its grip. As I slowly turned, I saw my sleeping body lying in the bed where I had left it. This wasn’t imagination. It wasn’t a dream.

Looking back now, I really don’t understand how my parents failed to see that something was happening to me. What young child races to go to sleep the moment the sun goes down?

I must have told them about my nightly adventures well over a thousand times. Every morning I would leap out of bed, eager and energized, explaining how I had gone further than the night before.

I was making new ground each time I slept, exploring the edges of our town, finding places I could not reach on foot, stretching my ability to its limits.

The wonder consumed me.

And they didn't even blink.

Why did they not notice?

As I lay atop my covers that night, the breeze drifting through my open window, caressing my skin and lulling me toward sleep, I prepared to set off on another adventure, just as I had every night for years by that point.

I felt like a seasoned dream veteran at the ripe age of eight. Detaching from my physical form had become almost simple with practice, and I no longer needed to enter a dream state before I projected my consciousness out into the world.

Before I realized it, I was looking at my room through more than eyes. I raised my hands and saw myself as an intangible, misty figure, circulating and pulsing with shimmering ethereal light, mirroring the shape and form of my material body. The colors I could see around me far surpassed anything my waking body was capable of perceiving, or even recalling. I glided over my sleeping body and drifted toward the open window.

Below me, the town lay dark and peaceful, quiet save for the gentle hum of dreaming that rose from the houses along the streets.

Everyone had a different hum. A distinct signature. Together, they blended into a soft symphony if I focused on it.

But it was not noise, not really. Not something I heard with ears. Not a smell. Not quite a glow. I don’t know what it was. I only know it was pleasant.

I would often float above the town and feel the song of my community as they dreamed. During the day I would try to remember how it went, but never could.

That night, I drifted through the cobblestone streets for hours, moving slowly from house to house, listening to the different melodic frequencies until I had nearly completed a full circuit around town and began to approach home. I knew the sun would rise soon. I sighed and made my way back slowly, soaking in the last chords of the chorus as people began to wake.

Then I stopped.

That was not right.

A terrible sensation tore open in my abdomen as the harmony twisted. A wrong note. A sudden, rotten assault on all my senses. I had never felt anything like it before. Granted, I was eight. My experience was relatively limited, but the significance of that moment was not lost on me. I knew what this was.

It was evil.

It was corruption.

It made me feel dirty, despite having no skin. It made me feel cold, despite lacking a body. I turned toward the source of it and saw where it was radiating from.

My neighbor’s house.

Layla Rayne was a girl my age who had moved into Galton with her family more recently than most of the households that resided there. We had only spoken once, at the town hall, when her family first arrived.

Her father was a big man. His hair was the color and texture of hay, cut short to frame a large head and thick neck. His skin was pale, and the area of his face was broad and smooth, though his individual features were smaller. His eyes were beady and sat close together, and his nose was narrow and pointed in contrast to the size of his almost cuboid skull. I found it strange how little his striking appearance had influenced his daughter’s.

Layla looked like a carbon copy of her mother. She had long, wavy, platinum blonde hair with dark, contrasting eyebrows that curved slightly upward at the center. About a dozen freckles were scattered across the bridge of her nose, which was significantly wider than her father’s and ended in a gentle upturn with small, round nostrils.

Her eyes were a deep blue with vibrant highlights of turquoise, like a glacial river flowing endlessly around her pupils. The outer corners of her eyes dipped slightly downward, and when paired with the upward curve of her brows, it gave her a faintly sad expression, though I had a feeling it was deeper than just that.

Her family hadn’t turned up to any town gatherings since their welcome party, and to be honest, they had not looked particularly thrilled to be there even then. I knew they came from some far away land, but I don't think that was why they stood out to me.

Of course, it is entirely possible that an eight-year-old version of myself saw a pretty girl my age and decided she was important, or even vital to the story of my life immediately. But even if it began as a shallow, gut level reaction, it did not remain so.

As I drifted slowly toward the ominous house that stood across from my own, the sensation grew heavier. I had no tongue, yet I swear I could taste it. The thick stench of darkness clung to me, suffocating me like clouds of pungent smoke, leaving a sickening film across my immaterial form.

It stung my eyes, though I did not have any. It pressed against me, resisting my movement. I pushed back, forcing myself forward until I reached the outer wall of the building and passed through it.

The house was still, but it was not peaceful. The fumes of predatory malice closed in around me, crushing me, as if I were submerged deep underwater. Pressure built on all sides, my mind ringing beneath its weight.

As I approached the open doorway where it seemed to originate, I froze. Layla was there in her bed, sweat beading along her brow as she slept. I could hear her dreaming. The hum was still there, soft and beautiful, but strained. Unsteady, like a violinist with trembling hands. I understood why.

An impenetrable darkness coated the walls of her room. Not the absence of light, but the presence of something else. It dripped from the ceiling, occasionally landing on her, soaking into her flesh. It twisted, shifted, and squelched unsettlingly, coating every surface as it released its own eerie hum.

This one was not melodic. It was a low, distorted buzzing and clicking, barely perceptible beneath the crushing weight pressing in on my mind. It sounded hungry. Impatient. Like the stomach of a bear rumbling as it stared into a hole it could not enter, waiting for the terrified animal inside to inevitably emerge.

I watched in horror, unable to make sense of what I was seeing. The mass of black, shadowy tendrils refused to stay in focus no matter how hard I concentrated. But something else moved within it. An object that drifted into view as the darkness ebbed and flowed, like a buoy riding violent waves.

It was pale. The inky substance around it swallowed most of the light in the room, making its shape difficult to define. It looked like a ring. Or some sort of odd disk.

Had I a heart, it would’ve sunk at that moment.

I shot up through the ceiling, scrambling back home and into my body, jolting awake instantly. I gasped for air, my heart slamming violently against my ribs, threatening to break free. Sweat soaked the blankets, as did a fresh puddle of urine I had released in my panic.

When I blinked I could still see it, burned into my eyelids as if I had been staring directly at the sun.

A single, grotesque eye.

And it was looking right at me.

“What does that mean, Dante?” my little brother Jasper asked, confused terror filling his face.

Guilt hit me immediately. I shouldn’t have told him about the thing I saw in the night. The weight of it was too much for a little kid. Though he was only two years younger than me, the gap between us felt more substantial than that. Like my fear was my responsibility, and his was mine too. I had to be brave.

For him.

“It’s nothing,” I said. “Just a dumb story. It wasn’t real.”

I forced a smile and wiped a stray tear from his cheek. He walked with his arms clasped behind his back as we continued to move through the vast forest behind our house, following the narrow trail worn into the dirt by countless afternoon expeditions. I went ahead, dragging a stick through the undergrowth and knocking at bushes as I passed, leaving a destructive wake of snapped stems and dead leaves.

We were heading for the little hut we had found deeper in the woods.

Our spot.

I’d say it was roughly half way between our house and Lake Aumèrn that sat beyond the dense bush, but I’m not certain. I had discovered the hut first during one of my night-time flights, but Jasper didn’t understand the significance of my otherworldly endeavors. Sometimes he would say he wished he could fly too, and I never knew how to respond to him.

I wasn't sure why he couldn’t.

Jasper stayed close to me, as if he were my shadow. He watched the way I walked, the way I held myself, and tried to copy it when he thought I wasn’t looking. If he caught me noticing, he would become shy and pretend he had not been doing anything at all, so I learned to smile to myself and let him have his secret.

I don’t know if he truly liked coming into the woods. I think he mostly wanted to impress me with his bravery. But he loved the hut. It was something we were both proud of, something that felt like it belonged to us. To two young boys, it represented independence. Adventure. A place that was ours alone.

It was special.

“Can m-monsters get us here?” he asked softly.

He hadn’t spoken up for a while, so I knew the thought had been sitting in his head the whole time, despite my reassurance.

“Nothing can get us out here,” I said. “I used my dream powers to put an invisible barrier around this place so only we can come in.”

I waved my stick through the air like a wizard casting a spell. He went quiet, thinking it over with absolute seriousness, as if I had just provided the most airtight logic he had ever heard.

“What if we want Ma and Da to visit?” he asked. The sadness in his voice was genuine and sweet.

“I can let them in whenever I want,” I declared confidently.

That did it. He grinned wide, showing the gap where a tooth had been just a week ago. Without hesitation, he grabbed a stick of his own and began drawing invisible symbols and shapes in the air, making a whooshing sound with his mouth as he placed an extra spell over the hut so our parents would not be able to see us when they were mad, just to be safe.

I chuckled and looked back out into the woods.

For a split second, I saw Layla standing there.

Then I blinked, and she was gone.

I wasn’t as rushed with my dinner that night. I pushed my food around my plate aimlessly, thinking about the past twenty-four hours. Ma and Da spoke casually about the talk of the town while Jasper watched my hand, then his own, struggling to hold his fork the same way I did. His face twisted with concentration as he tried to make his fingers obey, to no avail.

“What’s wrong with the neighbors?” I asked suddenly, somewhat surprising myself.

Da looked up, one cheek distended as he paused mid-chew. He took a moment to process what I had said. I was not referring to what I had seen the night before. I was more curious about the hushed tone everyone seemed to use when they spoke about them.

He swallowed hard, the food clearly not chewed enough, then reached for another forkful.

“Nothing’s wrong with them, bud,” he said lightly. “They’re just new. It takes time for people to settle into a place. Most folks here have been around a long time, and it can be hard to adjust to new…” He paused, searching for the right word. “New variables. In an environment you’re… accustomed to. Your routine and such.”

He looked back at me as if waiting for understanding as he took another bite.

I did not understand. I did not know what a variable was, or what accustomed meant. His effort to sound intelligent and knowledgeable was wasted on my young ears. But I nodded anyway.

He smiled, satisfied with himself. But Ma’s eyes betrayed what Da was trying to hide. There was a caution in her expression, a quiet worry. She had raised us to be kind and welcoming, but she had not raised us to be careless.

I lay in bed long after dark, unable to shake the image of that eye glaring at me from the shadows. Nothing had ever seen me before. I had drifted through houses and past waking people, unseen and imperceptible no matter how hard I tried to draw their attention.

Cold ran down my spine as I considered what it meant to be noticed outside my body. Could it hurt me? Could I die? The questions spiraled until my breath grew shallow and panic took hold.

Exhaustion eventually delivered me into an empty, dreamless sleep. I refused to leave the safety of my body, drifting in the blank expanse of my own mind and wishing the night would pass quickly, something didn’t happen, thanks to my ceaseless awareness.

My thoughts ran wild, fear echoing off the walls of my subconscious. Shadows began to swirl and twist within the darkness, catching my eye and tightening the knot in my chest. Below me was infinity. Above me was endless. All around me was the same oppressive nothing. My head swivelled at every subtle movement, until I saw it. There was nowhere to hide from what peered out from within the dark.

Its fleshy sclera was stained with jaundice, its pupil narrow and horizontal, somehow deeper and darker than the fluid pitch that formed an eyelid around it. I felt it watching.

Felt it judging.

Felt it calculating, analyzing.

I woke with a violent rush of adrenaline. I was not met with the comfort of my ceiling or the fairy lights. Around me stretched an ocean of viscous, coagulating black, consuming the room I thought to be safe. Above me, no more than an arm’s length away, hovered that disgusting eye, open wide, seething with enmity.

The stench of warm, putrid rot flooded my nostrils. The air felt thick and damp in my lungs, making me gag. I tried to move, blood roaring in my ears, but my body would not obey. Paralyzed, pinned to my bed, I began to cry as I choked on the smell and suffocated in its presence. My tears felt cold against the oppressive heat radiating from the thing looming over me.

As the darkness grew more tangible, my heartbeat accelerated. Pressure built inside my head and neck as I struggled to breathe. I could not look away. The eye at the center of my vision drew closer, its weight pressing into my mind. A warm stream of blood slipped from my nose, tracing my cheek and soaking into the pillow.

It pressed further still, as if I were an insect being studied between fingers, squeezed slowly, waiting to see when I would stop squirming. Waiting for me to burst.

This was it.

I shut my eyes and tore free from my body.

I heard the sharp gasp for air leave my physical form behind me as I fled, launching from the room and into the woods. I flipped over in the air as I rocketed, turning so my chest faced the sky and my back faced the earth, and looked back past my feet toward my house as it shrank in the distance. But something engulfed the space I’d covered, swallowing my house from sight.

It was following.

How had something so vast fit inside my small room? The creature was enormous in its entirety, its darkness spreading and oozing through the treeline until I could no longer see anything behind me but it. A tidal wave of tar, with a massive, yellowed eye brightly burning at its center.

I could not read its expression, but I felt its hunger. Its hatred. It closed the distance between us, and tendrils lashed outward like inky flame, snapping and licking at my ghostly form as I fled through the night.

I knew I could not keep going much longer. Whatever anchored me to my body would only stretch so far before it slowed me to a stop and let that thing catch me. I cried, but there were no tears to fall. I gasped for breath, though I had no need to breathe.

I was going to die.

As it gave chase, the low haunting rumble that it created grew louder to the point where it was almost unbearable. Like I was being pursued by a deafening orchestra of cosmic annihilation with a brass section fresh out of Hell. It hurt. My mind was frantically trying to hold itself together, to resist the growl of death as it threatened to unravel me completely.

I saw the hut ahead and felt a misplaced surge of hope, as if for a moment I believed the comforting lies I had told my brother about safety within its bounds.

What would he think when he ran up the staircase in the morning, full of excitement, eager to hear another story, to go on another adventure, only to find my lifeless body instead? My mind, my soul, devoured by the very evil I had promised him could never touch us.

I saw him crying out, wailing when I would not wake. Shaking me desperately. Calling my name. His small, fragile voice filled the room as his friend, his protector, his big brother lay dead before him.

Lost in a dream from which he can never awake.

The image carved a pit into my chest. The fear that had consumed me gave way to something that burned hotter, sharper, a childish anger, but a justified one. What right did this abomination have to trample these grounds, to breach what we had made sacred?

For a moment, I imagined I was exactly the hero Jasper believed me to be. And here I was, leading a monster straight to our fortress.

Our spot.

I came to an abrupt stop and immediately regretted it as I turned to face the writhing mass of wicked decay behind me. But I did not flee.

The eye slowed and halted just ahead of me, hovering there within the wall of black as if curious, waiting to see what I would do. My shimmering, gaseous form trembled, and I knew it noticed. I thought I could feel it smile.

Not any kind of smile I had ever known. This was a depraved, knowing smile. The smile of a predator that had already cornered its prey. It did not feel like a bear, hunting to survive. This was personal. It loathed me with deliberate, torturous intent.

Still, I did not move.

I noticed it had encapsulated me within its depths. Darkness descended from every direction, leaving only me, the hut behind me, and the wet, yellow eye.

In a split second it closed its grip, slamming into me from every angle with the force of an avalanche and dragging me into its tide. I cried out in agony as I burned and froze simultaneously. I felt myself coming undone while being crushed beneath the void, pulled apart and compacted in its brutal frenzy.

I cried for my Ma, for my Da. Dread filled me as I realized that I was alone, vanishing from existence without any cause discernible to the outside world. My family, my friends, all sleeping peacefully as I’m viciously and permanently erased. They would never know what happened to me. They would never know the torment of my final moments.

At least, I prayed they were my final moments. The thought that this was not an ending, but how I would spend eternity, crept into my mind as it was slowly and violently torn away.

I resigned myself to my fate, a decision with too much weight for a boy my age to ever have to worry about, but I had been forced to grow up in a very short amount of time. I closed my ethereal eyes, trying to focus on anything but the visceral, unspeakable pain pulsing through me.

Then I became aware of something else.

A faint sensation at the deepest point of my soul.

Warmth.

A hum.

I clung to it, hoping it would distract me from the agony, but as I focused, the humming grew louder. Stronger. I opened my eyes. The violent assault had slowed. The eye watched me with hesitation as I looked down at my phantom body.

My limbs were humming. Glowing.

It began in my fingertips. As I concentrated, the feeling spread through my hands, my forearms, and then through my entire being. Light sliced through the inky blackness of the nightmarish creature before me.

Power surged inside me. I channeled it. Focused it. Pulled myself back together piece by piece until, with a primal, unearthly shout of defiance and rage, I released everything at once.

A brilliant pulse erupted outward, illuminating the forest, shaking the trees, and sending the eye retreating backwards into the night.

And then I was truly alone. The barrage of noise and crushing pressure was gone. The woods were filled with a welcome silence, broken only by the distant hum of dreaming, reverberating through the trees from the town in the distance. The sanctity of our little hut was restored, its impenetrable walls standing unchallenged once again.
