This story takes place in a remote area of the UK but to protect the people involved I won’t say the exact location.
My friend Zahra, a British Pakistani influencer had just recently had her second child and her husband had gone away on a golf holiday leaving her alone with the two children. She was used to being left alone as her husband often worked away from home too and would often go away on vacation with his friends leaving her alone to take care of the children.

It was a stormy night and there was a lot of thunder so it was noisy. She started to feel uncomfortable as it was getting dark early and her house is fairly isolated so all the noise from outside was getting to her. 
At around 9pm she had just finished a cup of coffee in the kitchen, the children were asleep and Zahra was making sure the house was locked up for the night. She went back into the kitchen and saw that the back door was slightly open. She started to approach it but then felt very dizzy, stumbling and she fainted. 

Zahra slowly regained consciousness and was sat on a chair in the kitchen. The first thing she was aware of was how heavily she was breathing through her nose. She felt something covering her mouth, and after twisting her lips she realised it was duct tape that was sealing her lips. Zahra started to panic and tried to talk and shout but the gag around her mouth was preventing this. She struggled to move as well as she could feel her hands were taped together behind the chair and when she looked down she was duct taped to the chair and her feet were taped together. Her hard breathing popped the duct tape covering her mouth in and out. Then the lamp over her head switched on. Standing there before her was a medium built man with a hood on and a scarf covering his lower face. At this point, Zahra was obviously petrified and was mainly concerned for her two children sleeping upstairs. The man then said “I won’t hurt you but do you keep money in the house?” Zahra mumbled “no” against the tape.

The man had a large bag which he had filled with items such as Dubai jewellery from around the house. The next thing he said sent a chill up Zahra’s back, “don’t worry your kids are still asleep.” He then went to leave through the back kitchen door and before exiting turned and said “I’m sorry for this.” He then left the house leaving Zahra tied up and gagged. Zahra struggled with her bonds, grunting heavily through the tape on her mouth for a few minutes and then eventually freed her mouth from the tape by twisting her mouth and biting the tape. She managed to twist her hands out of the tape holding her wrists. She immediately ran to check on her children who had both slept through the entire ordeal. She phoned the police and the man was eventually apprehended later that week.

As mentioned, Zahra has an online presence so the man was aware of this and was aware that she was often left alone. He admitted to gaining entry to the back door and drugged her coffee which explains why she fainted. The burglar said he had lost his business and was in a desperate situation with the state of the economy but he did not wish to harm anyone. 

Zahra bears a resemblance to Kim Kardashian and the fact she is a micro influencer is likely what gave him this idea as a similar situation happened with Kim Kardashian a few years earlier. The man was aware of her online presence and he knew she was often left alone at home. 
Zahra is a very strong, feisty young woman so she did eventually learn to live with the situation however it’s not something you can ever fully recover from. She couldn’t help feel sorry for the man who did this but the feeling she had when she was gagged and helpless in that chair is something she’ll never forget.
