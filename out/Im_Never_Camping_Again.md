I lost my dad two years ago while we were out camping. Ill never forget anything about that day. It was an early morning in mid October and as usual, dad was ready for the annual camping trip. "Son get up, get dressed and lets get a move on." Dad said. My eyelids peeled open slowly as my body booted itself on. "I'm up pops just got to get my gear together." I said. "Be down in 15". I lied. I got dressed, grabbed my bag and headed downstairs. Dad was outside checking the engine on the truck, and mom was watching the news in the kitchen. "Dad said send you out when you came downstairs." Mom Said. I ran over to my mother and gave her a kiss on the cheek. "Love you momma ill see you in a couple days." I said. She said it back hugged me and shooed me off. Dad was getting the last bit of the equipment packed so I decided to put my stuff in the car and wait for him to finish.

"Son come help me with this." Dad said

I made my way over. "What's wrong pops you getting to old for this?" I laughed

"Ill never be to old to whoop your ass." He laughed

"Tony, If anything ever happens son Never go camping again." He said cryptically

"What's that supposed to mean dad?" I said but he ignored me and kept going.

I helped him with the rest of the equipment, we loaded it all up and got into the truck. My dad was a very kind man. Give you the shirt off his back kind of guy. He was funny, caring, and made you feel like you could conquer the world. He was also quiet and standoffish at times which I figured was his military service bleeding out. He never really talked about it but mom would always say "Dad came home after the war ended, But his mind is still at war." Some nights he would wake screaming and Id hear mom promising it was all ok and he's ok. But for the most part he was an amazing man who treated his family like royalty.

"So kiddo are you ready for this years camping trip?" Dad asked.

"Of course I am pops." I said. Lying straight thru my teeth, but I couldn't let him know that because it would crush him. I'm 16 now and I have a Girlfriend, this is getting to be kid stuff to me, But I love my dad and I Know what this means to him.

"You sure you're not upset you have to leave your little girly back home." He joked.

I brushed off the comment and sighed. He laughed and continued to drive out to the campsite. It took us about four hours to get out there. Its out in the middle of no where California, nothing but high trees and higher mountains. Our campsite was situated right on the side of a cliff  I began to pull the camping stuff out of the truck. I noticed my dad pacing and muttering under midbreath. He made his way around the area "checking things out." He seemed a little agitated but I  brushed it off and kept pulling things out. An hour or so later and camp was set up. It was about 3pm at this point and we were starting to get hungry.

"Lets get down to that river and get us some dinner." Dad said.

I agreed and we made our way down to the river. It was a 5 minute hike down the hill from our campsite to the river. When we got down to the river I noticed the cliff our campsite sat on overlooked it. The river was quite violent, churning rapids loud as plane engines. The roar could be felt in your chest. My father made his way down the river to a split off that ran into a creek. He explained The slower water was perfect for catching fish and then he froze. Abruptly his voice stopped. I looked over and noticed dad was staring into the woods and whispering something to himself I couldn't make out. His eyes so glazed over I'm surprised tears didn't begin to fall. I could hear him saying what sounded like "This last time" but I wasn't sure. I made my way closer to my dad.

"Dad are you ok?" I said, but he didn't move an inch. I looked out into the woods but seen nothing. I reached out to grab is shirt.

"Dad?" I fearfully asked. Fingers outreached trembling towards him.

All of a sudden he snaps out of it twisting his head towards me smiling.

"The slower water is perfect for catching fish son." he said. His head twisting slowly back towards the river.

I was quick to notice that this episode looked a lot like the symptoms of my fathers PTSD but he immediately snapped out of it. I was creeped out to say the least. The way he turned his head back towards the water scared me a little. I've never been afraid of my father but that scared me.

"Son hand me my fishing pole, Lets see if we can get us some grub." He said.

I handed him the pole and we began to fish. We caught what seemed like 100 fish. It basically turned into sport seeing as how we caught so many. The entire time we were fishing and laughing, The episode played in my head on repeat. I tried my best to just forget it and enjoy the day with my dad. We went back to the campsite after fishing for a couple of hours. We scaled the fish, gutted them, and skewered them on some branches and began to cook them. Dad grabbed a beer out of his cooler, sat down with a piece of wood and began to whittle it. I stood at the cliff and looked at the river. I grabbed a rock and chucked it down into the water. Id say we were about75 feet up but I was sure. I turned and looked at my dad wanting to question him about what happened today, but I couldn't. Maybe I was to afraid to trigger his PTSD I'm not sure what it was but I couldn't. Dinner finished and we sat down to eat. Besides the creepiness of the day id say it went pretty well. Dad cleaned up the dishes and I started to gather more wood for the coming day. By this time it was about 8pm and we were winding down.

"How was your dinner son tony?" He asked.

"It was awesome dad, Thanks for cooking." I said

He shot me a thumbs up and started whittling the wood again.

"Hey dad, What happened to you on the river today?" I worriedly asked.

"What do you mean?" He asked.

"you froze up dad and repeated something you just told me." I said.

"Froze up? What are you talking about?" He asked agitated

"It was nothing dad, you must not of heard me." I said

"I haven't been sleeping very well that's all, don't worry about it ok son." He said calming down.

He gestured over to his sleeping bag.

"Imma hit the hay son, Ill wake u up early morning so we can go hunt." He said.

"Alright goodnight, love you dad." I said

He disappeared into his tent and I did the same. I fell asleep quite fast from the activities of the day. All of a sudden I'm woken up to a scream. Not just any scream but it sounded to me like the scream of someone being tortured. As soon as I sat up in my tent it went quiet. no bugs, no fire crackling, no river, nothing. I unzipped my tent slowly and stuck my head outside. It was pitch black outside except for the glow of the moon on objects. I climbed out of my tent and made my way to dads tent. I unzipped it and stuck my head in.

"Dad are you ok." I said.

All I could hear was my father mumbling in his sleep. My father was having a conversation with himself.

"you cant take them, they're my family." He whispered

All of a sudden a voice came out of my father that couldn't have been his own. A deep guttural voice almost demon like.

"I will take you, then I will take them." It Growled

I stumbled backwards out of the tent and fell to the ground.

"Tony are you ok?" Dad asked peeking out of the tent.

"Yea sorry dad I was just checking on you." I said

"Are you ok dad?" I asked.

He shook his head yes and told me to go back to bed.

The rest of the night was calm. I laid in bed for an hour or so playing what I just heard over and over again in my head. I'm not sure what to chalk it up to but I don't know if that was PTSD. The following day it was pretty normal. We hiked around some, Fished some more, and gathered wood for the night. He didn't say much all day and seemed irritated. All in all another good day. I dared not ask dad about what I heard him say in his sleep. I'm not even sure he would have told me.

"Alright son I'm out." Dad said.

"Love you pops, see you in the morning." I said the last thing I got to say.

When I got into my tent I could feel anxiety creeping up my back. The events of last night burning into my memory. I forced myself to stop thinking about it. I began to tell myself to calm down and man up. Until I stood up and looked around in the darkness. That's when I noticed it. A silhouette of my dad standing completely still on the cliffs edge, whispering, and looking down at the river. I gasped in horror and began to sprint  towards my dad. I got about 10 ft. behind him and froze. I could finally hear what he was saying.

"You can have me but not them, This is the last time you hurt me." He said whispering.

Dad are you o...

Before I could even finish the though my dad looked back at me and said "Never go camping again son." and he leapt off of the cliff.

"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" I screamed. The shock I felt almost made me pass out. I stood there emotionless not understanding what just happened. Feeling slowly coming back to me I began to sob. I ran to the cliffs edge but there was nothing I could have done. Staring into the darkness listening to the roar of the river below, Reality began to set in. I need to get help right now. I grabbed the keys and hopped into the truck and drove all the way home to get help. I drove home in shock. I could swear I kept seeing my dad in the back of the truck The entire 4 hour drive was a blur. I got home and rushed to my mother and explained to her what happened.

She collapsed and began to sob. We called the authorities and they went out to search. Not a single trace was found of my father. It was like he disappeared. That was two years ago. I'm 18 now and its coming up on our annual trip. I haven't gone in the last 2 years since I moved after that. I'm going up to stay with my mom for the weekend.

The night I got there was the night before the annual trip was to take place. I got in greeted my mother and had dinner. That night I woke up to a cold chill running up my back. I opened my eyes and stared around the dark room. It was so quiet in the room it frightened me. A whisper broke thru the darkness. "son get up." It whispered.  I sat up on the bed and rubbed my eyes. That's when I noticed it. A persons face looking at me from the bottom of the window looking into the back yard. More specifically my fathers face. His skin was paper white and his hair was matted. His eyes were black and evil. He began to speak in a quiet deep tone.

"Son are you ready to go camping?" He said raising a had and tapping on the window with his long sharp fingernails.

I stared in absolute horror, frozen by what I was looking at. I didn't say anything. I couldn't say anything. I stood up and backed away

from the window. I turn the light on and he is gone. I open my door and go into my mothers room.

"mom are you awake." I asked.

"yes I'm awake son what's wrong." She asked.

"Mom we need to leave right now, something is outside and it....

Just then my mom cuts me off.

"He cant get you son if you don't agree to go camping." She said as she rolled back over and went right back to sleep.

"mom what the hell is that supposed to mean?!" I yelled but she ignored me.

This is crazy I thought to myself. Did I really just see my dead dad staring at me thru the window. I decided to step outside and see for myself. I'm not gonna be able to ever sleep again if I don't figure this out. I walked around the house to where my window was and nothing was there. Just the woods behind our house and nothing more.

"Wont you go camping with me son." A voice called from the woods.

"wont you please?"

Just then a figure on all fours scuttles out of the woods towards me and begins to scream horrible screams. I fall backwards on my ass and close my eyes waiting for the inevitable end. The screams get louder and louder until they're almost right on top of me.

"IM NOT GOING CAMPING WITH YOU!" I screamed at the top of my lungs my hands covering my eyes.

Silence.

I pry my hands away from my face and look up expecting to be met with some horror. Nothing was there. No sign that anything had even been there. At my feet was a small wooden cross with the words father and son carved into it. The cross my father whittled. I picked it up and keep it with me to this day. I'm not sure if I'm going crazy or not but I know this for sure. I'm Never Camping Again.
