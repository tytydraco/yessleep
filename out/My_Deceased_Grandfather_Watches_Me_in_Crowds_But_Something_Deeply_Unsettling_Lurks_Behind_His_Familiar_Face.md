The day my grandfather died, it was as if the sun had been snuffed out, plunging my world into darkness. But in the days following his funeral, I began to notice something that would make me wish for the simplicity of grief: my grandfather was still here, but horribly altered.

It started innocently enough. At first, I would catch glimpses of him in crowded places – a flash of his familiar face in a sea of strangers. But the joy of seeing him again quickly turned to dread as I realized that something was profoundly wrong. His once-sparkling blue eyes were now a void of inky blackness, as if his soul had been sucked out and replaced with a malevolent force. His skin appeared unnaturally stretched and waxy, clinging to his skull like a grotesque mask. Worst of all were his teeth, now unnervingly elongated and sharp, as if designed for tearing flesh rather than offering warm smiles.

The terror I felt was soon replaced by a sense of despair and helplessness. No matter where I went or what I did, he was there, watching me with those bottomless, soulless eyes. The more I tried to avoid him, the more frequently he appeared. My life quickly became a living nightmare, an existence consumed by fear and paranoia.

In desperation, I retreated to my home, hoping that its walls would protect me from this monstrous version of my beloved grandfather. I shut out the world, refusing to leave the house for any reason, even to buy groceries or interact with friends. My only connection to the outside was through the cold, sterile lens of a computer screen.

For a while, my isolation seemed to offer some reprieve from the horror. 

But then, one stormy night, my fragile sanctuary was shattered. As thunder roared and lightning illuminated the darkness, I heard a soft but persistent tapping on my bedroom window. My heart raced as I hesitated to approach, fearing what I might find on the other side of the glass.

When I finally mustered the courage to pull back the curtains, the sight that greeted me nearly stopped my heart. There he was – the grotesque doppelgänger of my grandfather, his twisted face distorted by a malevolent grin, his elongated teeth glinting in the moonlight. His spindly fingers tapped against the window, leaving behind a viscous, dark residue that seemed to spread and pulse with a life of its own.

The tapping continued every night, each time growing louder and more insistent. I tried to barricade my room, stacking furniture against the window in a futile attempt to silence the sound. But the tapping only grew louder, the relentless rhythm burrowing into my mind, infecting my thoughts and dreams.

As the days blurred into weeks, my sanity began to fray. My sleepless nights were filled with disturbing visions of my grandfather, his once-kindly face now a nightmarish mask of evil. I began to see him even when I closed my eyes, his black, empty gaze boring into my soul.

The darkness in my home grew deeper, as if the malevolent presence outside was seeping in through the cracks in the walls. Shadows danced and twisted in the corners of my vision, forming grotesque shapes that whispered promises of pain and despair. I could feel my strength and will to resist ebbing away, leaving me vulnerable to whatever dark power now controlled my grandfather's form.

I know that I cannot endure this torment much longer. Each night, the tapping grows more desperate, more insistent, as if the thing outside knows that my resolve is weakening. Soon, I fear I will be unable to resist the urge to open the window and face the horror that waits in the darkness.
