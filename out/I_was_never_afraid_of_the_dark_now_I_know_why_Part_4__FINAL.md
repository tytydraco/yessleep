I panicked, suddenly realizing what the mysterious woman had meant. I sprinted towards the house, covering the distance almost as rapidly as she had, and rushed inside.

I spotted her just as she was beginning to ascend the stairs, and I charged at her in a blind rage.

"Stay away from my parents!" I shouted, instinctively pouncing on her with my claws and fangs. But she was faster. With one hand, she smacked me, sending me flying against the room. My body impacted the far wall with a loud crash, leaving a large indentation. It hurt, but I didn't care, as I stood up and charged again.

"It's encouraging to see that you've got some fight in you," she grinned, turning away from the stairs to approach me. "Unfortunately for you, you're young and inexperienced. You can't win."

I simply growled in response, attempting to sink my teeth into her neck, but she deftly sidestepped me and threw me across the room again. I landed near the bottom of the stairwell, just as I noticed my parents at the top of the stairs, having been awoken by the commotion.

"Nate, what the hell is-" my father began, before I cut him off.

"Mom! Dad! Run! Get the fuck out of here as fast as-"

Before I could finish, I felt a sharp pain in my right leg, as the woman's claws impaled me and began to drag me back towards the center of the room. I struggled to free myself, but I only succeeded in lodging her claws deeper inside my thigh. Screaming, I tried to strike back with my own claws, but she caught my hand and twisted, instantly snapping my wrist.

"Okay, I'll do it!" I shouted, realizing I was no match for her. "I'll go with you, live in the woods, eat people, whatever! Just please don't hurt my parents!"

She scoffed, a look of disgust crossing her features. "Pathetic," she spat. "Have some pride in yourself, Nate. There is nothing I hate more than seeing one of my kind act like a sniveling coward." She threw me to the side, removing her claws from my leg with a sickening *pop*, and approaching the stairs. "Just for that, I'm going to make your parents' deaths as slow as possible, and force you to watch."

I screamed, partially in pain, but mostly in rage. I wanted to kill this woman. Not only for the sake of protecting my parents, but out of some primal instinct I didn't understand. Somehow, I was still able to use both legs, and I kicked her, sending her flying out of a window, the glass shattering as she crashed through it.

I heard my parents shouting, but I couldn't make out the words. I was too consumed by the feeling of pure, instinctual fury that had come over me. I dove through the broken window, going after the monster woman.

She was fast though, and had already risen to her feet. Before I could get my hands around her neck, she swiped at me with her claws, tearing a series of gashes across my face and temporarily blinding me. I continued charging forward, pure instinct guiding my movements, as I stabbed the claws on both of my hands into the woman's stomach. I heard her grunt in pain this time, a very satisfying sound. Before I could continue with my assault, though, I felt her sharp claws stab into my neck, just missing my throat by inches.

The next few minutes were a blur. Maybe not even that. Similar to when I had attacked Cliff, I simply have no memories of those moments. The next thing I knew, I was standing alone in the yard, a fair ways away from my last position. My entire body hurt, and the pain was greater than any I could recall. I was bleeding from multiple claw and fang wounds, and my sight was only just beginning to return, as the night still appeared blurry. "W-where are you!?" I stammered, trying to sound intimidating, but likely failing.

I heard a soft chuckle from above me. Looking up, I saw the outline of the monster woman, crouching on a thick tree branch at the edge of the woods. It was hard to tell in the darkness, but something told her that she was just as badly injured as me, or at least close to it.

"How unexpected," she laughed. "You will make a superb predator, Nate."

"Get out of here! Leave us alone, and never come back!" I shouted.

This only caused her to laugh harder. "*Us?*" she repeated in a mocking tone. "Do you not realize what you just did?" She raised a clawed finger and pointed at something behind me.

Against my instincts and better judgment, I turned around. I'll never forget the sight that greeted my eyes.

My mother and father lay mangled on the lawn, a few feet away from me. They looked much like Cliff had after I slaughtered him. Their bodies were ripped open, and various organs and viscera were strewn across the grass nearby. The expression on my father's face was one of pure terror. There wasn't enough remaining of my mother's face to make out any expression at all.

"You bitch!" I turned to face the woman, who had now jumped down from the tree. "You killed-"

"I didn't touch them," she interrupted, a twisted smile on her face. "After you lost control of yourself, they ran out after you. I decided to pull back and watch as your instincts took over."

"Y-you're lying!" I said, realizing what she was implying. She laughed again and raised her hands, giving me a clear look at her claws. They were covered in blood, but it was already beginning to dry, and there wasn't nearly enough to account for all of the wounds inflicted on my parents.

I raised my own hands, and saw them positively dripping with blood. I felt rivulets of the stuff dripping down my cheeks as well. Just then, I coughed and spat up something - a chunk of bloody cloth, the texture matching that of the pajama shirt my mother was wearing.

"No..."

"Do you see now?" the woman asked, somehow managing to sound slightly sympathetic. "This was going to happen eventually if you had chosen to stay with them. There was never any other possible outcome."

I collapsed to the ground, crying. Or at least, I tried to cry, but no tears wold come out. Instead, I screamed in anger and despair.

"Your injuries should heal in less than a day," she continued, unfazed by my emotional display. "I suggest we leave before the police show up. Enough bullets can be dangerous even to us."

I looked up at her, my expression one of pure hate, but it soon softened. I had no one to blame for this but myself. I turned around, taking one last look at the remains of my parents. Seeing their corpses filled me with intense sadness, but there was also something else... a hunger. I quickly shook my head, trying to dismiss the thought from my mind. The woman seemed to have picked up on it somehow, though.

"Go ahead. They're your kills. Feast, to your stomach's content."

I resisted the urge, and instead took off into the woods, in the opposite direction from the woman. I was worried that she would chase me at first, but after several minutes, I realized that there was no sign of any pursuit.

That was almost 20 years ago. I've since lost count of how many people I've killed and eaten. I didn't want to do it at first, but it just became more and more natural to me as time went on. I never ran into that woman again, but I did have brief contact with several other Nocturnals, those like me. Got into a few fights with them on occasion, as well, mostly territorial disputes.

I can still maintain a pretense of humanity for a while. I go into town quite often, keeping my appetite in check as I walk among my potential meals. I've been posting this from a series of internet cafes... I never went back to school after that night, so I apologize for any grammar mistakes or awkward writing. I just felt the urge to tell my story after all these years - don't ask me why.

I should leave now; I'm getting hungry.
