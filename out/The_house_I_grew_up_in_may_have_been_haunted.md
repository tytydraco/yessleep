 

My parents moved into this house with my older siblings and I before I was even one year old.  And we lived in that house for over 20 years.  Strange things happen sporadically over the years we lived there.  It got to the point that I refuse to even step foot back in.

These are what I can remember since it has been a few years after we all moved out of that house.

I was around 5 or 6 and it was storming outside.  My siblings and I were watching TV.  Every now and then we would hear the front door close, even though the door was already closed to begin with.  Our parents were already asleep in their room.  After maybe hearing it close 5 times I rushed upstairs and forced myself to sleep.  That was the only time it has happened.

One time when I was in 9th grade I woke up in the middle of the night.  In my sleepy haze I thought I saw a woman in her mid 40s with blonde hair.  She was standing in the corner, but that was where a dresser stood as well.  I blinked to try and clear my head, but that woman was gone after that.  It freaked me out.  I thought I was losing my mind and seeing things that werenâ€™t there.

Now this event occurred when I was in college.  I was home alone, and no appliance was on, or my laptop was running.  It was basically quiet in the house.  Then I heard two muffled voices. A man and a woman conversing with one another.  I looked around the house to try and find out where it was coming from but found nothing.  I was still alone in that house.

Other times when all of us would leave and come back after dark; we would see that the basement light was on.  This was when we all stopped going down to the basement long ago.

At other times the pets that we had would speak to an empty space or just stare at nothing.

After a beloved pet died my older sister and I would sometimes hear something running up and down the stairs.

My sister and a friend of hers witnessed the TV turn on by itself.  The remote was nowhere near them.

Another time she saw a figure in the middle of her room.  After a second it vanished.

She would see a figure in a tree outside her window but would turn around when she changed her clothes.

And of course, things would disappear and sometimes turn back up.  Whatever not turn back up, we just replace or accept the fact that it is gone.

Yeah, we were able to endure a lot.  We could not move out because we did not have a lot of money.

My siblings and I moved out of that house and a few years ago my parents followed.  And we have not experienced anything strange or abnormal since.
