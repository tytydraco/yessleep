I’m a hunter. Not one of those weekend warriors with a brand-new rifle and unscuffed boots. I’m the real deal. I’ve spent more of my life in the deep, quiet woods than I have in the city. I know the sounds, the smells, the rhythms of the wild. I can tell a deer from a coyote by the way it snaps a twig. I can read a story in a set of tracks. I’ve always felt more at home out there, in a world that operates on a simple, honest set of rules: predator and prey.

Last week, I went on a multi-day hunt in a vast, remote section of national forest I’d never explored before. It was a primeval kind of place, where the trees were ancient and the silence was so deep it felt like a physical weight. After a day of scouting, I found what I thought was the perfect spot for my tree stand.

It was a small, natural clearing, a sun-dappled oasis in the otherwise dense forest. A well-worn game trail cut right through the middle of it. It was a textbook ambush point, a natural funnel. I could see the tracks of deer, fox, even what looked like a black bear. This was it. This was the spot.

I set up my stand in a large oak tree just outside the clearing, giving myself a perfect, concealed vantage point. I was up in the stand before dawn the next morning, a full hour before the sun was due to rise. I settled in, a thermos of hot, black coffee in my hand, and I waited.

The forest began to wake up around me. The grey, pre-dawn gloom slowly gave way to the first, tentative rays of sunlight. The air was cool and crisp, and the world was hushed, expectant. This is my favorite moment. The moment of pure, quiet potential.

As the sun cleared the horizon, casting long, golden shafts of light into the clearing, she appeared. A beautiful, healthy-looking doe. She stepped out of the trees and into the center of the clearing, her movements graceful and cautious. This was it. A perfect, clean shot.

I slowly, silently, raised my rifle. I settled the stock against my shoulder, my breathing slow and even. I looked through the scope, centering the crosshairs on her vital zone. And my blood ran cold.

The deer had no face.

I pulled my eye away from the scope, my heart hammering against my ribs. I looked at her with my naked eyes. She was still there, perfectly real. But where her eyes, her nose, her mouth, and her muzzle should have been, there was just… a smooth, featureless, unbroken expanse of brown fur. It was like a sculptor had formed a perfect, lifelike deer, and then had simply forgotten, or refused, to carve the face.

I looked back through the scope, my hands trembling. The magnification made it even more grotesque. There was no detail. No hint of a feature. Just a blank, furry canvas. And she was… grazing. Her faceless head was bent to the ground, and she was placidly chewing on the grass. Chewing, with a mouth she didn't have. Eating grass she couldn't possibly be swallowing.

I lowered my rifle, a wave of nausea and profound, dizzying wrongness washing over me. This was impossible. This was a dream. A hallucination. I squeezed my eyes shut, then opened them again. She was still there. Still placidly, impossibly, grazing.

I just sat there in my stand, paralyzed by a mixture of terror and morbid fascination. A few minutes later, a flock of small, grey birds descended into the clearing. They landed on the grass near the deer, hopping and chirping. But their chirps were… wrong. They were a flat, toneless, repetitive sound, like a broken recording.

I raised my binoculars, my hands shaking so badly it was hard to focus. And I saw that they were wrong, too. They had no eyes. No beaks. They were just smooth, bird-shaped lumps of grey feathers, hopping and pecking at a ground they couldn't see, with beaks they didn't possess.

Then, a squirrel. It scampered into the clearing, its movements jerky and unnatural. It was a perfect, bushy-tailed squirrel shape, but its head was a featureless, furry nub. A rabbit followed, a smooth, long-eared automaton, hopping and twitching a nose that wasn't there.

Everything that entered this clearing was a flawed, unfinished copy of a real animal. A gallery of impossible, living taxidermy.

I looked around the clearing, my eyes searching for an explanation. And I noticed it. A strange, almost invisible shimmer in the air, right in the very center of the clearing, rising from the ground like a heat haze on a hot day. But the air was cool. This was something else. A distortion. A warp in the very fabric of the world.

I stayed in that tree stand for hours, a silent, terrified witness to this parade of broken creatures. I couldn't leave. I was pinned there by a need to understand.

Late in the afternoon, while scanning the treeline, I saw a flash of plastic. About thirty yards from my stand, strapped to a tree, was a trail camera. It was an older model, its casing weathered and green with moss. It was pointed directly at the clearing. Someone else had seen this. Someone else had been watching.

I waited until the light began to fade, until the faceless menagerie had dispersed back into the woods. Then I climbed down from my stand, my legs stiff and unsteady. I made my way over to the trail camera. The latch was rusted shut, but I managed to pry it open with my hunting knife. The SD card was still inside.

My hands were trembling as I slotted the card into the portable viewer I carry in my pack. The screen flickered to life. The first few weeks of photos were exactly what you’d expect. Normal, healthy animals. A handsome buck, a curious fox, a family of raccoons. The clearing was a normal, healthy part of the forest.

Then, the pictures started to change.

It started subtly. A photo of a fox, perfectly normal, except its ears were just smooth, rounded nubs of fur. A few days later, a picture of a black bear, but its paws were wrong. The long, sharp claws were missing, the pads of its feet smooth and featureless.

As I scrolled through the photos, chronologically, the "glitch" got worse. The changes became more severe. A coyote with no snout, just a tapering of fur. A flock of wild turkeys that were just feathered, headless bodies, still pecking at the ground.

The last photo on the card was from two days ago. It was the doe. The same one I had seen this morning. Her face was a perfect, horrifying, featureless blank. The glitch, whatever it was, was progressing. It was getting worse. It was learning, but it was a clumsy, terrible student of biology.

That night, I didn't sleep. I sat in my cold, dark tent, the images from the clearing and the trail camera playing on a loop in my head. My hunter's brain, the part of me that understood the simple, honest rules of the wild, was screaming. This was not a natural place. These were not natural things.

The next morning, I was back in my tree stand before dawn. I don’t know why. I should have packed my things and hiked out of there as fast as my legs could carry me. But I had to see it again. I had to understand.

The faceless deer returned at sunrise, just as it had the day before. The birds without beaks followed. The silent, impossible pantomime of life began again.

And then, a new actor entered the stage.

It was a bear. A massive, healthy, very real black bear. It lumbered out of the trees on the far side of the clearing, its powerful head low to the ground, sniffing the air. It was a magnificent, terrifying animal. The kind of trophy that hunters dream of. But I didn't even think of my rifle.

The bear saw the faceless doe, which was still placidly “grazing” in the center of the clearing. The bear’s posture changed. It went from a slow, ambling search to a focused, predatory crouch. This was it. The moment of truth. The intersection of the real and the unreal.

The bear began to stalk the deer, its movements silent and fluid. The doe, of course, did not react. It had no eyes to see, no ears to hear, no nose to scent the danger.

The bear closed the distance, gathering its powerful muscles for the final, explosive charge.

And then, everything happened at once.

From every corner of the clearing, they appeared. The fox with no ears. The squirrel with the nub head. A dozen eyeless rabbits. A flock of beaked birds that descended from the trees like a feathered, silent storm. Every broken, glitched creature I had seen, and more, all emerged from the woods at the same time.

And they all moved towards the bear.

It wasn't a stampede. It was an attack. A coordinated, silent, utterly terrifying assault. The fox with no ears lunged, its jaw snapping at the bear's legs. The eyeless rabbits swarmed, their bodies thudding against the bear's flank. The beaked birds descended, a flurry of silent, pecking motion.

The bear roared, a sound of surprise and pain and fury. It swatted at the creatures, sending them flying, but there were too many. They moved with a jerky, unnatural purpose, a hive mind of flawed creations.

And in that moment of absolute, heart-stopping horror, I finally understood.

The clearing wasn't a glitch. It was a trap.

It was a hunting ground for something else. Something from outside. The flawed animals, they were lures. Poorly constructed, but effective. An entity that didn't understand biology perfectly, but it knew what shapes should be in a forest. It knew what a predator would be drawn to. The faceless deer wasn't the prey. The bear was. This entire, impossible menagerie of broken creatures was the bait. And I was sitting in a tree stand, a silent spectator at a feeding.

I should have run then. But I was frozen, my mind reeling with the terrible, cosmic implications of what I was witnessing. I was watching something that was not of this world, hunt in a way that did not obey its rules.

The bear, roaring in a mixture of rage and terror, finally broke free from the swarm of silent, attacking puppets. It turned and fled, crashing back into the woods, the glitched animals in silent, jerky pursuit.

The clearing was empty again. The silence that fell was more profound, more terrifying, than ever before.

And that’s when I heard it. A sound that didn’t belong. The soft, deliberate snap of a twig.

Directly behind me.

I froze. Every muscle in my body went rigid. The sound had come from the base of my tree. Slowly, my heart a block of ice in my chest, I turned my head.

A man was standing there, at the bottom of my tree stand ladder. He was a hunter. He was dressed in the same camouflage gear as me, holding a rifle that was identical to my own.

And he was looking up at me.

Or he would have been, if he had eyes.

Where his face should have been, there was just a smooth, blank, featureless expanse of pale skin.

He raised his rifle, the one that was a perfect copy of mine. And I finally understood the last, most terrible piece of the puzzle.

I didn’t wait. I didn't scream. I just moved. I scrambled out of my stand, half-climbing, half-falling down the other side of the tree, my expensive rifle abandoned. I hit the ground hard, the impact jarring my teeth, and I ran.

I didn't look back. I didn't dare. I just ran, my lungs burning, my mind a blank slate of pure, animal terror. I burst out of the woods and onto the dirt road where I’d parked my car, my hands shaking so badly it took me three tries to get the key in the ignition.

I’m home now. But I’m not safe. I keep seeing him. Not the real one. The copy. In the corner of my eye, in the reflection of a dark window, in a crowd of people. A man in my clothes, with my build, but with a face that is a smooth, horrifying blank.

I don't know what the thing in the clearing is. But I know that it saw me. It learned my shape. And now it has a new lure. A new, perfect bait to place in its silent, deadly trap. And I have the terrible, unshakable feeling that one day, it’s going to use it to hunt for another human.
