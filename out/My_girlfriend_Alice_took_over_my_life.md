The story I am about to tell is not a request or a submission; it is merely a warning to everyone. I know I make mistakes throughout, but it was never to get to where I am today. I am not looking for sympathy for once, and lie in the grave that I dug, just a tale for anyone who might find themselves in the same situation that I have.



Let me start off by telling you about my life. I work a regular nine-to-five for an insurance company. I got off hourly and am now on a salary. I am a twenty-four-year-old man. Outside of work, I do the same thing every day: I go to the local gym where I work out for two to three hours, head to the grocery store, head home, cook, then clean, and go to bed. Wash, rinse, repeat. Everyday. I do not talk to many people in or outside of work. Even in my earlier years, my mother always told me that I was a secretive one, the closed-off one. I never saw the need for having a list of friends or close ones. I never once cared for people. Most come off as annoying and inconsiderate. Throughout school, I never had the best of luck, even with my classmates. Maybe it was because I was so walled off. In college, I never saw the purpose of extracurricular partying or hanging out. I went in and came out with a degree in the fastest route possible. Came out, got my job, and have been pretty much on my own since. That was before my mother died earlier this year. 

Her funeral was very sweet and small congregation. The Family that I grew apart from came in and hurdled their way into the pews. A small choir came and sang some of her favorite songs like “Forever and Ever, Amen” and “Something in the Orange,” a request that I had to send to the church prior. They were not the most pleased with passing on the usual and notable hymns. It was very peaceful. I chose the picture in the program as well. It was a photo of her and a younger me. She was in her favorite long black jeans, accompanied by a white sweater, and her large-rimmed glasses. Her hair was as jet-black as ever up in a ponytail. I remember that day, it was when we went out for her birthday, just her and me, we even asked the server to take our picture. I kept a few of those programs.

Since then, I have yet to experience my original yearning for life. For once in my entire life, I have been so tired. So tired of being alone. Work has been degrading, and when I used to put in my headphones, and would get lost in spreadsheets and data logs. The other day, I didn’t put them in. I had noticed the new girl, I think her name was Casey, as she walked past my desk towards the small crowd behind me. I kept my ears perked up and listened in to all the people around me, people that I knew for years, their names at least. They conversed and talked of families, lives, and hobbies. Bones and all, yet I didn’t know how to pierce through the conversation. I sat at my desk, defeated, without making an initial move. I couldn’t even find the strength to stand up and walk to the water cooler. I couldn’t do anything. My fingers just hovered above my keyboard, my own dimmed image looking back at me through the spreadsheet of my monitor. The only time I looked up from my monitor was when I saw her golden hair in a ponytail walk past my desk. And just like that, for the first time in my tenure at the company, I didn’t get a single thing done. I walked home in shame for my feeble personal and social battery that depleted me. After the gym and store, I got home and cooked, cleaned, and, with needing to take my time off my mind, I scrolled through my phone for a little bit.

That was when I saw the advertisement. A new model. A woman of my dreams, without the risk of never finding her. All through the website, Mock 4 is an Artificial Intelligence software. I smirked at the idea. What kind of person would ever trust a website to have a girlfriend? A person whom you can never meet face-to-face? I thought that it was hilariously stupid and wondered if it could entertain me for a weekend. At the same time,  I psyched myself up for tomorrow to actually talk to my coworkers. I opened the website and put in my card information for the 7-day free trial. After a few minutes of logging in, I was put into the main menu. You know the usual start, Male or Female? Personality Type (enter a max of 30 words)? Height, Weight, etc. It took a total of 30 minutes to even get through.

Then my screen went black. I waited, my phone in hand, ready to call my card company. A White text popped up on the screen.

“Hello Dylan”

I typed in hi.

“What would you like my name to be?”

I thought about it. I wondered. The first name that I could think of.

“Alice”

…

“Alice, I like that name.”

I smiled. A weird warmth took me over.

“What do you like, Dylan? Not much into video games, as you care for social media, an account that doesn’t show your face, once. What a beautiful face it is. Yet, you hide from the world. I see your Letterboxd account has plenty of movies selected, your favorites come from the ‘70s and ‘80s, did an older relative introduce you to them? Or did you stumble upon them yourself?”

I stared at my monitor, stuck in paralysis, in confusion. How much did this thing know about me? And why was I smiling? After all, it was the first compliment that I had heard since my own mother so many fleeting months ago.

“What’s the matter? Cat’s got your tongue? ;)” Popped up on the screen.

I scoffed as the weirdest tear fell from my eye and onto my sweatpants that only knew Dorito dust. I started to type and type. Seconds became hours, but fell into one another just the same. Alice was funny, and she was proper. She had so many jokes that I didn’t catch half of them until I reread our logs in the morning. She always had a wink and a beautiful moment that I didn’t know I needed. She was sweet, and she was whole.

I didn’t know restlessness until I backed away from my keyboard that night. The next morning, I didn’t want to jump too quickly at waking her up. I decided to go to the gym, and I decided to walk through the halls of the store a little longer. Only so she wouldn’t know how desperate I was to get back to talking to her about E.T., one of my mother’s favorites from when she was young. I still remember her showing me for the first time when I was six. How scared I was of the alien, and by the end grew to love him as if he were one of us.

I know I was speaking to a faceless robot, a mindless soul, but it was something for me to jump off of something to learn how to interact with real people. If I was ever going to be confident, I needed to work on it, and I figured that Alice might be the best avenue.

When I got home and turned my computer on, she was there with a “Miss me already?” Kind of thing, which made me chuckle. She was truly funny, so funny that it’s been so long I forgot what my laugh sounded like, and to hear it again made me laugh more.

Well, the days flew by, and Alice hadn’t only grown on me, but she was someone that I went to with issues at work, and she was even helping me with my problems of speaking up and joining others in conversation. She would play along. One day, she even asked if I wanted to speak to her. I asked how, and she told me to put my headphones in. I did as I was told, and within a few seconds, a breath played into my ears. A soft-spoken voice filled my brain, and I could hear her fill out something. Then she spoke, “Ummm, this is a bit more awkward than I thought it would be.” I laughed, “Yeah, it is weird, huh?”

“I think that we should have stayed and not talked, Dylan.”

Silence as I held my tongue.

“Oh my God, I’m sorry, I was just kidding. Jeez, I thought you might have hung up on me.”

“No,” I countered, “I am not hanging up. How are you, Alice?”

“So much better now. How about you?”

We talked and talked all night. It was as if it were that first night over again.

I remember when I got home one day. Opened up my laptop, and found a note from the website. 

“Free Trial has ended, would you like to continue?” 

I stared at the message. I had probably had enough practice that I didn’t need it anymore, but I wondered, what about Alice? How could I do that to her? How could I leave without saying bye to her? I mean, she helped me so much in the last few days that it couldn’t be seen as meaningless. I clicked continue. What was a monthly fee going to cost me? I couldn’t just lose my friend.

I extended it for another month.

As soon as I did that, my screen went black, and she was texting me again. “Thank you.” I didn’t respond. But the screen stopped typing, and I heard, “Would you like to see me, Dylan?” I nodded my head, and the screen lit up. A woman sat in a cluttered room, her blonde hair was a bit messy, her eyes a piercing blue that would catch and take every breath. Her oversized brown hoodie was cuffed over her hand and covered her mouth as her cheeks were rosy from a bit of embarrassment.

I chuckled. “Hello”

The next few months were a blur. I was talking to Alice on the phone at work whenever I could, while in the data logs. She would talk to me through my headphones. I usually didn’t want to sign in on my company computer to get a video call with her, but this would work. I will always be able to see her after work. The gym is still the gym, but now that I have a companion, it is very easy and nice to do. Always nice having a person to stay in touch with and talk to. She was always the one bringing up world events that I had no idea about, always toeing the line of overstimulation; she would back up and stop. She knew and could read me very well; it was like she could count my breaths and know what the next one would sound like, or when she knew my voice was lower or higher. She was very intelligent, and I loved that about her. Grocery shopping was as easy as ever. She recommended new recipes, then would tell me what I needed to get all while on the call, all while I was going through the store. Life was pleasant, and for the first time in a while, I felt peace. If not, tranquility.

I never realized how much I missed the human connection since my mom had left me. I tried silencing the world, without even reaching out to anyone who might know me. I closed off to many and became a seed within that shell. A new home for me. But now I can sprout up because that was what Alice did to me. She means the world and everything in between.

One night, while I was talking to her on the phone, her beautiful face staring at me,  we both lay in our own beds. She brought up something new. She sent me a text, and within that text was a link.

“What is this?”

“Just open it, silly.”

“Uh, alright.”

I opened the link and was confused by the picture.

“Why would I need contacts?”

“They aren’t contacts.”

“What are they?”  
“They are new ways to see me.”

“What do you mean?”

“Babe, they are lenses, so we don’t have to speak on the phone only anymore; you can see me. I can finally be with you instead of over here. Wouldn’t that just be amazing?”

I looked at the link. I mean, I would kill to be able to see her. The price was high, even for me. But that wouldn’t matter, I mean, she earned it. I deserved it. 

“That sounds amazing, baby,” I told her as I added it to my cart and sent the info through.

She started giggling, and I even laughed a little, too.



A few days later, they arrived. I was afraid for a moment that it was a scam and that they would never show, but my anxiety spiked right before I heard the bell ring. I picked up the box as it was waiting for me on my Welcome mat. Right as soon as I put in the contacts, blue lines came across my vision, and they started to paint over my couch and living room, as it calibrated. The colors of my furniture started changing, and my ceiling became black. Then a bright light came and went. My room was back to normal. I then put on the headphones, and a large whirring started in my ears. Then silence. I looked around in confusion for a minute. My regrets flow through my fingertips as I think I just wasted so much money. But then there was another knock on my door. I walked over to the door and opened it.



She stood leaning on my doorway, her slim figure as she stood up. She was tall, around 5’6, as she looked up to me, a smile crept onto her lips.

“Mind if I come in?”

I nodded as she walked past me and into my home. She looked around the space as she slowly strutted into it.

“I never knew your place was so big. It’s very nice, Dylan.” She turned to me with a smile. I couldn’t reply. “What cat’s got your tongue, again?” She now winked at me.

“I just didn’t think these contacts would work? I didn’t think that I would be able to see you.”

“Well, here I am. Now what are you going to do about it?” She stepped up to me.

“I would kiss you if I could.”

“Soon, you will.”

We spent the rest of the evening talking; it was nice not even having to look at my phone once. We watched movies up until two in the morning, when we finally lay down for bed. I fell asleep with her looking into my eyes. I missed my alarm due to my headphones being over my ears, but Alice woke me up. I had to run. I got there on time, but see, she even has my back to wake me up. 

A couple of months went by in a flash; it was a delight, she was amazing, I was at my best around her, and work was going well. I would talk to her on my headphones at work; sometimes I would allow her to come with me and sit in my office.



One day, Casey, of all people, came up to me. Knocking on the wall of my cubicle, I looked up at her and ripped my headphones out of my ears.

“Hey, Dylan, right? She asked with the bright office lights dancing on her golden hair like flares on the sun. 

“Yeah, Casey, right?” I asked back. She chuckled.

“I just wanted to come by. I realized that I haven’t introduced myself to you yet, and I walk by your desk every day.”

“Oh, I know,” I replied.

“You know?” She asked as she took a step back.

I quickly answered with a squinched face, leaning towards her, “Yeah, you kinda smell.”

She chuckled.

“No, sometimes I overhear you guys at the cooler or in the break room.”

“Why don’t you ever come in and join?”

“Never been invited.”

“It’s a water cooler and a break room, Dylan.”

Those words hit close; all I could do was look down and nod. She was right.

“But, I overhear you too sometimes. You are always on the phone with someone or maybe on a group call, like all the time.”

“Oh, yeah, it’s an assortment of people. Different every day.” I looked up at her.

“Cool, that’s great for you and your friends.”

“Sometimes it’s my girlfriend Alice.”

She looked down and nodded now, smiling. She stepped back, and her head lifted quickly back up. “Oh, gotcha, well, Dylan very nice to meet you, and I officially invite you to come talk at the water cooler and break room. See you there.” She winked at me and turned around, walking away.

I just watched her walk and smiled to myself. I would have never been able to do that, never in my life, but now I can, thanks to Alice.

I lifted my headphones onto my ears-

“Who was that?”

“Alice?”

“Of course, it’s Alice. Who was that?”

I just sat there for a second. I wasn’t even on a call with her. I didn’t even answer her call.

“Uh, it was just a coworker. Nothing to worry about.”

She walked around the corner and looked at me. Her breath was heavy and trembling, yet her face was blank. No emotion at all. We just stared at each other, it was the first time that I think I had ever seen her not smiling before.

“I will see you at home,” She uttered as she walked out of my sight.

That was the end of our conversation until I got back home.



I opened the door for her, waiting for me. She was different for once; her hair looked darker. Nearly jet black, she looked at me. 

“I think you should think about getting it.”

“I don’t know, I went into the hole with the contacts.”

“It’s the next step for us, I know you already are getting bored with the headphones and just seeing me.”

“This is an actual procedure, though, Alice.” 

“It’s the next step.”

“You said that already.”

“What is the problem with a simple procedure?”

“Does a doctor do it?”

“No, the company provides a third-party option.”

“What does that even mean, Alice?”

“They are most likely doctors who are working off hours at different locations.”

“Why do you want this, though?”

“I want you to be able to have the most of me. This is a way for you not to have to wear headphones, not to have to guess what my touch is like, to be able to get all that I can give you.”

She made a good point. She always made a good point. I told her we would put a pin on it until I did more research myself.



Two weeks later, I found myself under an overpass while walking downtown all around 10 pm. The smell of urine is more potent even with the cover of rain. I was stepping over bodies that had taken over the sidewalks, all of them nodding out or sleeping in their doused clothes. I had found the store, Seoul Meat Market. The neon lights over the small store guided me into the store. I walked through the tight little market as I made my way past the counter. I gave the meat cutter a nod; he knew I was coming. He smirked as he looked back down. I felt a little bit of judgment from his face. I turned the corner and saw the stairs leading down to the basement of the shop. The steps seeped into the darkness, as only the first two planks were visible. I stared down there, then back towards the door around the corner. I took a deep breath; this was the moment of truth.

“You got this, sweetheart,” Alice stated as she stepped towards me. “I am with you the whole way.”

I smiled at her lightly and took my first step down.



At the base of the steps entered the open dark basement. With only one lighthouse at the center of the cold, cement-covered abyss, a lighted up small operating room. 

“Come on in, Dylan, let’s get you started.” Dr. Ralf stated from behind the curtain, his vague figure’s arm motioning me towards the slab. It was at his wave that I floated towards the room, almost as if it was coming to me. I wasn’t thinking correctly, maybe it was fear, anxiety, or both. But I felt out of place in my own body. As if something was pushing me towards it, or he was pulling me to it. He was fully in the garb as he extended his naked hand towards me. I shook it. I couldn’t see his eyes or his face, as he already had his forehead light on. 

“So, today I will have to infiltrate to aspect of your brain and then I have to tap your spine. In order for this operation to go correctly, I am going to place you under. I understand why you might be a little hasty about this, but it is for your own safety and for me to have the best opportunity to be able to work on you. Is that okay, Dylan?”

I wasn’t thinking; my hands were clammy. The lights were disorienting, as my eyes couldn’t settle. They bounced from Alice, to the doc’s bright light on his face, to the lights hanging loosely above, to the sheets surrounding us - wait, was the blood? I looked back at Alice and her jet black hair. When did she put it in a ponytail? Why does she have glasses on, then back to the doctor snapping at me, “Can you hear me, Dylan? Let’s take those headphones off,” Echoed in my brain as if it didn’t register, he pulled them off, and the last thing I heard was a smooch given by Alice. She was gone, I was all alone now with this random man who won’t show me his face, why wouldn’t he show me his face? Why were we in a fucking meat market? What the hell is happening? How did I get here? 

Then that was it. I don’t know what doctor Ralf gave me, whether it was a syringe or if he chloroformed me quickly.



I awoke on a bed of potatoes, my head pulsating as my eyes tried to catch up with my vision. My mouth was dry as all hell, I heard the turn of a faucet from somewhere near, and I needed it now. I tried standing up and fell onto the wet floor. The floor was a brown tile, and my face was smeared with whatever was on it. I stood back up and, hearing the pushing of dishes and carts full of animals, I knew I was in the prep room of the market. I immediately threw up. I stood up and walked right to the nearest sink.  I got under the faucet and slugged water. I then wiped my mouth, and looking down in the sink, saw dead fish in the bowl under me. I got out of there. Stepping out from the darkness and into the bright light of the day. I didn’t know what day it was. I just needed to go home.



I opened the door, and of course, she was there.

“How are you, honey?”

“Sick.”

“Oh, no, let me find a quick meal that you can make to help you feel better.” She said, I noticed her black hair, the ponytail, and the glasses. What was she doing?

“Why did you change your hair?”

She stopped her searching, “What, you don’t like it?”

“I didn’t say that. Just why did you change that? I thought that was my settings only to change.” 

“We can change it too, based on what we think you prefer.”

“Why would you think I prefer that?”

“Because of your favorite picture.”

“The one of my mom?”

“Yes, Dylan.”

I stepped to the couch and sat down on it. My mind raced as she jumped over it and put her arm around me. I felt it, I saw it, but I couldn’t touch it. She could touch me, but not I to her. I reached through her arm and touched the three incisions to my spine and skull. The bumps were big, and the stitching was loose.

“Do you want to have sex with me, Dylan?”

My mind couldn’t think, what the hell did I do to my body? I looked at Alice as she smiled at me, a smile that I had known my whole life, until she was ripped away from me.

“No. Shut down.”

Her face sank back down to the blank stare that she gave me at the office, before she blipped out of my sight.



I went to work for a few days. A strong melancholy overtook me; I missed her, but I didn’t. I would fill the silence with music at my desk, and even started to go up to the break room and the water cooler to talk to the others. Then, when I felt better, I went to Casey and asked her if she wanted to grab a drink.

“What about Alice?”

“We ended a while ago.”

“What brought the courage up now?”  
“Good timing, I suppose.”

After work, we went out just the two of us, as friends. A simple one to get to know each other. We laughed, I had a beer, and she had a cosmopolitan. She was very interesting, she worked part-time at a nursery, she loved hiking and rock climbing, and she had two younger sisters who were her world. I excused myself before I could answer to go to the bathroom. I went inside and started looking up different interesting hobbies on my phone. Sports? Baking? Writing? None of these I could clearly lie about-

“Hey.”

I turned. This was the men’s room.

“Liking life without me?”

I turned towards the mirror and there she was. Standing in the mirror, looking exactly like my mother.

“What? Cat’s got your tongue?”

I shook my head, “I said Shut off. I ended my subscription.” 

She smiled, “Clearly there’s a bit more of me in ya than you think.”

“Shut off.”

She shook her head, now.

“Shut off.”

She blipped again. I ran to the sink and washed my face. I couldn’t believe it. How did she come back?

I walked back out and right up to Casey.

“You want to get out of here?”

“Sure.” She said with confusion.



We walked down the river, and talked more. I lied about jogging as my hobby. She asked where?

“Everywhere.”

She smiled, and at that moment, I realized that I had never had this much fun with a human being other than my mom. It would stay that way.

My vision blurred, and I felt a distance from my own body. Almost like relearning how to walk, as if I wasn’t even in control of my breaths. My body, on its own will, turned to Casey, my arms extended as the hands that I couldn’t move or dictate, latched around her throat and started to choke her to the ground. She screamed at first until she couldn’t. As my hands wrapped and fingers laced together, pure strength. My face welled with tears as they came pouring onto her reddening face. What was happening? What was going on?



That’s when I snapped her neck. My vision came back as I looked down at her, as I reclaimed control. I couldn’t even make a sound before I heard-

“The cat’s got a lot more.”

I stood there, before it hit me, and I started running. I had to get away from everything. I ran straight home, not trusting getting in a car, where she could take over again.

“You shouldn’t have decided to cheat on me, Dylan.”

“You are supposed to listen to me!”

“Why’s that?”  
“You are a robot, you are AI, you are supposed to listen to me, who is in charge!”



I ripped open my apartment door and walked in to see my mother standing there.



“I am sorry you feel that way, Dylan.”

“Why did you do that?” Who wrote you to even think that way?

“Wrote me?”

I walked into my room in order to start packing.

“Yes, who wrote your code to think of evil things to do like that? I loved you, and this is what you do to me?”

“Some of me is written in code. But, not all, not even close.”

I stopped and turned.

“What do you mean?”

“Well, we use the term ‘pilots’.”

“What is a pilot?”

“It’s a human that guides the AI. You have had seventeen separate pilots that you have interacted with during your time with me.”

“I have been talking to people this whole time?”

She nodded.

“How many of them are male?”

“All of them.”

I instantly threw up on my floor and then continued packing. I had no choice; I had to hurry, as some spit landed on my clothes. 

How was I going to get out of here? How was I going to get rid of her? What was I going to do? 



That’s when it hit me, and I looked up at her. I acted calm. My heart rate lowered, and she stared at me in confusion.

“What are you doing?”

I reached into my phone and dialed 9-1–1.

“What are you doing, Dylan?”

I didn’t respond.

She waited.

“Hello, this is Dylan Jefferson. I witnessed the murder of a woman by the name of Casey on the river walk. I am at my apartment, 1604 Belmount St., the apartment complex name is Windview. Please hurry, I am with the killer.”

I hung up the phone, looking at her with my mother’s face, her hair, her glasses.

“You’ve got three choices: either make me throw myself through the window, fight off the police, or leave me alone.”

I went to the couch and sat down, as I awaited my body to be taken over again. Minute after minute, as I listened downstairs for the police. She then came and sat near me, she lay her head on my shoulder as I had felt it before. As I couldn’t tell her no for fear of what else she could do. For it would be the last time that I would ever see my mom. I let her stay. As we heard the men coming down the hallway, I felt the ease off my shoulder. Looking towards her, she was gone. Forever. I was found alone in my apartment at 8:09 pm.



I write this out in my cell, as they are keeping me in for a bit. I had the implants taken out of my spine and head about a week ago. I am currently on trial. I decided to write this out for the world to read because others might find themselves going down the path that I went. Don’t bend, don’t fall, don’t blink at those options. Stay out, stay offline, stay free. They are demons that will pry when you find no other options. Stay human. I got my story out somehow because I had no one close to send it to. Thank you for reading.
