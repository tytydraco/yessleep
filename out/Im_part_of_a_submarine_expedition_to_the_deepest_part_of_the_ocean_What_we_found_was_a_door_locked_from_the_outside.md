It looked like an old steel bulkhead, the kind you would find in the interior of an old military vessel, with those large wheels that you have to turn to open the door. 

Over 10,000 meters of depth and 15,200 PSI is what our equipment measured. To find anything man-made at that depth was inconceivable. I couldn't believe it.

It was on the side of an especially steep drop. The rectangle of steel, while difficult to spot, did not exactly appear natural. It stood out to me, despite the total lack of visibility. I immediately turned to my partner.

“It's crazy how the darkness fucks with your brain if you stare into it long enough,” I said.

The submersible was a research submarine designed for a two-man crew, but there was barely enough space for one. Stanley was the man next to me, he was my copilot and research scientist.

“I know what you're talking about,” said Stanley with a smile. “That rock looks like a cabin door, it's got the wheel and everything.”

“That's exactly what I was thinking,” I leaned in to take a closer look. “Look how smooth it is, too.”

It seemed we both knew we had to take a closer look. I slowed the descent of the ship and intensified the headlights.

There, in the middle of a steep, jagged cliff, over 10,000 meters below the ocean's surface, was a door. It was impossible to mistake it for a rock formation. It had perfectly cut edges, rounded and smoothed out, completely symmetrical. It had a wheel in the center, too, which coincided with no rock I had ever seen. Without a doubt, it was a door—a steel bulkhead.

“How in the world…” I said. “A shipwreck… here? It can't be in such a perfect condition,” I was whispering.

We continued our slow descent until the bulkhead was directly in front of us. I halted the submarine with the beams pointing directly at the door.

“Take some pictures, and send them up along with some data,” I told Stanley.

I heard Stanley clicking at the machinery. I stood still, staring into the monitor in front of me. The submarine was very small, and did not have a window to the outside. Our exterior was displayed on a small screen. I leaned in to get a closer look.

My eyes widened.

“Wait, Stanley,” I said. 

Stanley faced me.

“The bottom right… look.”

Stanley turned his head and looked into the monitor.

There, engraved on the surface of the door, near the bottom right, was a very short collection of images. I was amazed that we had missed them before, but as I intensified the headlights again there could be no doubt that they were there.

One of them caught my attention. It was the one in the middle—the third drawing. Very minimalistic, very small, but it was the outline of a skull—a human skull. It looked more like a caricature; the forehead was a little too round, and the chin was slightly too short, it looked like a human skull drawn from memory—or at least similar to one.

But the other ones—the other five pictures—were even more unsettling. The first one, though a little wide, looked like some prehistoric skeleton, or a representation of a fossil. From there, the drawings were nearly incomprehensible.

One was a long, angular skull that coincided with no animal I had ever seen. Another looked like the depiction of a bug, maybe a wasp or mantis, only bony and cadaverous. 

The one thing the images had in common was that in some way, they all looked like skulls.

“What the fuck…” Stanley whispered.

“Quick, take the pictures,” I was still staring into the monitor.

I watched Stanley take a new snapshot, then turn to his computer. He began typing, transferring data from the submersible.

“Alright, it's sending,” he said. “What do you think they are?”

I was hypnotized. I couldn't stop looking at the door and the caricatures engraved onto it. 

“Probably a warning, like signs representing a hazard,” I said, “The middle one looks kinda like a human skull.”

 Whatever was in there, it didn't take a genius to understand that we weren't supposed to go inside. The lock on the outside, the depictions, the depth itself—told us everything.

“Hey, Alex,” I heard Stanley say, and I snapped out of my trance. “It only makes sense to open it.”

I snapped my head to the side.

“Are you insane? It absolutely does not!” I raised my voice slightly. 

Stanley stood still, looking confused. I didn't think I would need to explain myself, and I sighed.

“A steel bulkhead, 10,000 meters below the ocean's surface, with half a dozen depictions of animal-like skeletons—of which all but one are familiar, sealed from the *outside*… and you want to open it?”

“Well, maybe we should get the green light first, I guess. I already asked the crew,” he said.

“Yeah well, the crew is gonna take my side, I promise you,” I said and Stanley shrugged. “It's probably nuclear waste or something like that, and it's *definitely* not meant to be opened.”

Stanley looked back at me. 

“Doors to nuclear waste don't have doorknobs,” Stanley said. “They're sealed airtight, welded shut, and buried with concrete.”

He had a point, but before I could say anything in response, a message arrived.

<Proceed>

We stared in confusion.

“They're telling us to open the door,” Stanley said.

“No, they're telling us to proceed with our original mission, isn't it obvious?” I responded.

The response was extremely odd. We would typically have received detailed instructions, or at least a well-structured, professional response.

“Alex, move the submarine forward, I need to get close enough to use the mechanical arms,” he said. I was shocked.

“You're telling me that a group of highly trained, intelligent research scientists just gave us the go-ahead to open a watertight door with 15,000 PSI of pressure?”

“The message says proceed, that's the literal definition of a go-ahead.”

“Send another one, tell them to be clear this time,” I told him, though I wasn't even sure why I was entertaining the idea.

I heard him typing, and I watched him closely this time. Sure enough, he asked the crew to elaborate, and sent the message.

We waited in silence for a few moments. We had been delayed enough already, I couldn't wait to leave the door behind.

Just then, the message arrived.

<OPEN THE DOOR>

My eyes went wide.

Something about the message made my blood freeze. It was unlike any message we had received.

“I told you, Alex, now move the submarine forward,” Stanley was impatient.

“I… something is wrong, they wouldn't have sent…”

“Alex!” Stanley screamed.

The extremely small cabin made the sound seem louder that it should have been. It caught me off guard.

“Stanley, I can't do that, you have to understand how unprofessional such a response is, the team would not have sent that,” I spoke calmly.

“Well, they just did. Why are you refusing orders?”

“This isn't the military, Stanley, and I'm still the captain of this vessel,” I said.

Stanley did not seem happy. He was anxious somehow, and he furrowed his brow in a mixture of anger and confusion.

“Alex, if you don't move the sub forward, I will.”

I was shocked.

“Stanley, listen to me.”

“Alex! If you don't move the submersible forward, I will!”

Suddenly, he grabbed my wrist and squeezed.

“We have the go-ahead, Alex. Move the sub.”

I had never seen him like that. Stanley was a large man and his strength was far above mine, but he had always been the kindest, most lighthearted person on the team. 

“What—what are you doing? Let go of me!”

Suddenly, he lunged forward and tried to stand. The space was too small for him to stand, and his back hit the ceiling of the cabin. His hand was still around my wrist, and his free hand was moving for the control panel.

I twisted my body and managed to get out from under him. I pushed him away while having my back to the wall. It worked with great effort, and he fell back in his seat.

“Move the ship forward!” He screamed, spit flying from his mouth as he did.

“Stanley! Calm down!”

He seemed to be in a frenzy. His chest rose and fell rapidly, and he gripped his chair so hard that his fingernails dug into the cushions.

“Stan! What is the matter with you?”

I grabbed my wrist with my other hand, massaging the area. He had scratched the skin on my wrist, and had gripped so hard that the flesh was turning red.

“I…” Stanley started, taking deep breaths between pauses. “I just know that we have to get closer, or else I can't use the mechanical arms to open the door.”

“But why do you want to open the door?” I said in disbelief.

He made a nasty expression, as if I had said something unreasonable. He took a sharp breath through his teeth.

“Alex, for the last time, if you don't move the submersible forward, I will,” he said. I saw him grip the armrest of his chair even harder.

“Stanley, it would be illogical to open…”

He pushed himself off his chair and slammed into me. 

I was pushed back, and my head slammed against the wall beside me. I grabbed the back of my head in pain. By the time I recovered from the impact, I saw Stanley on the control panel.

The submarine was moving forward.

I leaned forward, but Stanley was still leaning onto my chair, and his knee was pushing me down. I tried to push him away, but the space was so small that his back was against the ceiling, and there was no space to push him toward. 

I decided to grab his hands instead, and pull them away from the controls. 

I pulled at his hand and managed to shift it away from the lever. The rapid motion made the submarine jolt forward, and the sub crashed against the cliffside.

We were thrown forward violently, and Stanley's body smashed into the main monitor.

He turned around at me, and his face was entirely red. The look on his face was savage. He was breathing through his teeth, and his eyes were nothing but pupils.

He jumped toward me, slamming into me and scratching me with his nails. I brought my knee up and smashed it against his ribcage. He screamed, but he continued grabbing at my throat and clawing with his nails. Then, his right hand was able to close around my neck, and he squeezed with all the strength he had.

I couldn't comprehend what was happening, but I wasn't going to try to talk my way out of it anymore. Stanley was my friend, but this could not have been the same man as before.

I hit him as hard as I could with my knee, but his grip did not loosen, though he screamed in fury. I tried, again and again—all of my hits landing perfectly, but he would not let go.

The pressure inside my head increased. It felt as if every vein in my head was about to explode.

I hit him again, and I was sure that I had felt his rib crack. Still, he only screamed, and tightened his grip.

My vision was fading, I had to think of something.

I saw the monitor—the one displaying the exterior. Stanley had smashed into it, and the support had been destroyed, but it was still connected to its cable. I reached out and grabbed it, pulling at it until the cable snapped and the heavy monitor came loose.

I brought it up and slammed down, connecting with the back of his neck.

Stanley went limp, falling on my chest.

I gasped frantically, holding my neck.

I write this now, sitting in silence, trying to process what has just happened.

The monitor is gone—the submarine's sight is gone. Stanley's body is limp against me, as I have been unable to push him away in the cramped space, which is now claustrophobic. The only camera left is the one that is connected to the claw of a mechanical arm outside.

I am writing this on Stanley's computer. As I do, I keep receiving the same, exact message.

<TURN THE WHEEL>

The apparatus that controls the mechanical arms outside is still intact. I know that if I simply reach over, and use the small camera to find the wheel, I can open the door.

I want to move the submersible away—to start my ascent to the surface. Trust me, I do, but I can't.

The ballast systems, no matter what I do, won't respond. I am stuck here.

I have asked for help, but I only receive the same message…

<TURN THE WHEEL>

I'm sorry.

I say that because, after all of this—after what happened to Stanley—and without knowing why, I really—**really**—want to listen.

I really want to turn the wheel.

Worst of all, I don't even know why.
