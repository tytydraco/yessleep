As the title says, I work in a tire warehouse — and it’s hell.

The hours are long, my boss is a prick, the orders never end, and the smell of rubber and dust gets into your skin. But the pay’s decent, and thanks to my mom working in the office, I got the job easy. I’ve been here about seven months now. Not that time makes much sense anymore.

I can lift 50 pounds over my head, read an order slip without needing a supervisor to break it down for me, and most importantly, I can operate the Order Picker. If you don’t know what that is, consider yourself lucky. Google it. It’s basically a motorized lift that lets me fetch tires off the top racks—racks stacked so high you’d swear they vanish into the ceiling.

Over the past few months, the Picker’s become my faithful steed. We move together like one. I don’t just operate it anymore—I feel it hum beneath me, like it’s alive. Sometimes I catch myself whispering to it. And sometimes… I think it whispers back.

I got into a fight with Marcus not long ago. Found him using my Picker. He said he just needed to grab a 225/60R18 off the third tier, but I didn’t care. He shouldn’t have touched it. It’s mine. After that argument, he stopped showing up. I asked around, but no one else seemed to notice. Or they just avoided the question.

Honestly? I don’t remember the last time I saw another person. Some days the warehouse feels endless. A steel-and-rubber maze echoing with the same mechanical beeps and low hydraulic groans, looping endlessly. I fulfill orders that appear on my tablet — black letters on a gray screen, always another list of tires, always urgent. But I haven’t seen a truck pull out for delivery in days. Or weeks.

I try to take breaks. I really do. But the moment I stop moving, I get this crawling sensation in my neck, like something’s watching from the rafters. So I keep going. Me, my Picker, and the orders.

Yesterday—I think it was yesterday—I noticed the tires on the top rack looked… different. Older. Cracked. Some had symbols etched into the rubber, ones I know don’t belong to any brand we carry. I scanned one of them with the tablet. It didn’t beep. The screen just turned black for a few seconds, then showed a new order.

“Bring it down. Stack them tall.”

I didn’t question it.

Today, I think I saw someone standing at the far end of the warehouse. Tall. Still. Watching. I yelled, but they didn’t move. When I drove the Picker over, they were gone. In their place, a single tire. Old. Ancient, even. Something was pulsing beneath the tread.

I staged it anyway. That’s my job.

I think it’s been three days since I saw someone. At least… I hope it’s only been three. But this place doesn’t obey time the way it used to. My steed still hums, faithful and warm. The orders still come. And somewhere, buried in the stacks, I swear I hear voices calling my name.

I’ve got to get back to work. I just wanted someone to know what’s happening here.

If you’re reading this—don’t apply. Don’t come looking. The warehouse doesn’t let anyone leave once it picks you.
