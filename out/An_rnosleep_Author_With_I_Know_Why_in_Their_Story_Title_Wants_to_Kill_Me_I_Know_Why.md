It was late on a Tuesday. I couldn’t sleep, I tried everything. I counted sheep; even pictured them lollygagging one by one off a steep escarpment and landing with a pleasant splash into a pale blue body of water. I tried watching ASMR videos on YouTube. I tried drinking three fingers of Canadian whiskey. Nothing worked. I was wide eyed and tireless.

When I could bear it no longer, I went online and looked up some remedies, but my search instead led me to this strange subreddit community called r/nosleep. Y’all know it? Some of the shit I read was completely fucked. The place was brimming with the most bizarre stories I’d ever read in my life. And they were all first-hand accounts and real experiences. To be frank, it gave me the heebie-jeebies. “Cool, baby, cool,” I said to myself, and lemon squeezied.

But as I lurked and scrolled, I noticed an odd and rather unaffecting pattern. There seemed to be this common theme in which story titles ended with “I Know Why”, and I didn’t know why. Ironically, these stories seemed to be the most popular of the lot, which was at odds with my beliefs, because I found them to be the least enticing of titles. A title, whether it be a representation of prose, or music, or film, should evoke—in blunt and succinct clarity—the central idea or concept of the work being represented, not a tagline with an edge sharp enough to cut through someone’s curiosity. Besides, one would expect an author to “know why”, would they not?

One of the first stories I came across on this subreddit was a marvelous read, one that conjured up a fear so tangible that it pressed on my bladder and I thought I would soil my sheets. It had the affable title of, Little Feet, which, I mistakenly decided could not be very scary, since little feet were often associated with something rather cute. Regrettably, it was about a young girl that had been the victim of an old Chinese tradition called foot binding. The procedure is painful, and this particular girl in the story was the poor victim of many cruel injustices. To silence her screams during the foot binding process—according to the history of this tale—her tormentors put a hammer to her jaw. It was only later, when they noticed that her silence was not just a vocal matter, but as well a physiological one, that it was discovered the poor girl had choked to death upon her own shattered teeth. The teller of this tale henceforth invites us on the journey of their own very unsettling, albeit brief, encounters with the spirit of the owner of the titular little feet. And then: heebie-jeebies.

When the story concluded, and my heartbeat settled, I found the courage to read a more popular story titled, My Girlfriend Keeps Watching Me While I Sleep. I Know Why. This one may have been the remedy I was searching for, because it nearly put me to sleep, so I figured I’d check out a few more stories with similar titles. I did want to sleep, remember. I managed to get through a few more similarly titled stories before coming across the real breadwinner. It was called, My Dad Used to Spank My Little Butt with a Flyswatter. I Know Why.

Now this one really set off to irk me, because it wasn’t at all based in horror. The author had fallen accountable for some sad form of emotional repression to disguise his childhood abuse in something supernatural. As some convoluted coping mechanism, he truly believed that his father had been possessed by a house-fly after he had spent the day assaulting an infestation of the insects with a flyswatter. Within his rampage he, unknowingly, had murdered several dozens of this house-fly’s kin. And so this one fly survivor had succumbed to a malicious intent to exact revenge upon the author’s father by flying directly into his mouth the following day, and, finding its way to his brain, it then assumed squatter’s rights and took control of his father’s actions like a master puppeteer. He believed, truly, that all the times his father came into his bedroom with a goofy grin and a brandished flyswatter, that it was the actions of the house-fly, intent on killing, or at the very least harming, his children. I said to myself, “You don’t know why! Your butt wasn’t blistered red with flyswatter welts because of some fly in your father’s brain. Boy, you were tormented like the girl with the broken feet. Boy, you let your father off the hook!”

So I commented. I said, “Hey, buddy. You clearly don’t know why your father used to spank your little butt with a flyswatter, but you’ve enlightened us all on the subject and it is I that now knows why.” I went on to explain to him how parental physical abuse worked, and that he shouldn’t so willingly absolve his father of his cruel and demented behaviour based on a flawed and utterly absurd belief in parasitic flies.

I got off the internet, feeling wasted and angry for no particular reason and tried for sleep once more. A few minutes later I got a notification from Reddit. The son of a bitch replied to me. It was the strangest thing, too, for it said only this: “Bzzz, bzzz. I’ma getcha! Bzzz, bzzz.”

Naturally, I didn’t respond, because I don’t particularly participate in conversations with weirdos, so I ignored it and went to sleep. It took a long while, but I finally found success. Except I dreamed. I dreamt of a big old butt being spanked by a massive flyswatter. It was my butt.

The next day when I awoke, I performed the regular actions of readying myself and left the house for the bank. There, I withdrew five-thousand dollars. The withdrawal was made for a simple reason. I needed to buy a couch. The one I had was old, and the cushions were sunk low as if they were made of memory foam. The furniture store displayed for me many couches, but it was only one that interested me, and I was especially glad to discover that the price was far below my preliminary withdrawal. At the check-out, the clerk asked if I wanted to buy a bag for fifteen cents. I said, “You think this couch will fit in a bag?” She said, “Naw.” And then her eyes grew wide, fixing upon something behind me, and she cried, “Sir! Look out!”

I spun around in time to see a pimply young man sprinting down the aisle at me. The peculiar way of his gaze stunned me into inaction. I stood my ground, not unlike a statue that resolved only to stare and wonder, and it was within his gaze that I found myself thinking of psychotics, or mentally afflicted souls. My wonderment was reinforced when I spied a large fly-swatter in the man’s left grip, and as he gained on my immobile place in the furniture store, he held it out as if to swing, and then his arm circumvented my frame as he aimed fixedly on my buttocks. Now, this might sound a little far-fetched, but I have studied the sacred art of karate my whole life. In fact, I made a career out of it. Yes, I’m a karate teacher. So what I did next was instinctual and my response came quick. I cartwheeled backwards to dodge his swing, and as my legs came up, I connected my heel to his chin and he went up with the momentum of my dodge, biting at the air before landing hard on his ass and sprawling like a dip of shit. The flyswatter went skidding across the polished floor and stopped abruptly at the foot of an old woman with frazzled hair and a walker. She looked at the swatter and said, “Oh lordy, lord.” Then she looked at me and pointed an accusatory finger. “Karate boy!” she shouted, her mouth trembling. Small tears pooled around the base of her eyelids and I was certain she was going to croak out of fear, for there was no mistaking that look in her eyes. “Karate boy!” she shouted with wicked disdain, and the tremble in her voice was as clear as her words. “Help! There’s a karate boy in the store! Someone call the police!”

Meanwhile, the young man was regaining his feet, and with a stupid grin he said, “I’ma getcha!” And without a tendency for reason, he came at me once more with open hands, reaching, reaching, reaching for my butt, but I dodged and swung and dodged and swung, and pretty soon he was splayed upon the floor once more like a dripping dip of shit.

The old woman had now gone almost completely berserk with alarm. “Karate boy!” she shouted on repeat like a siren. The clerk had a phone to her ear and was speaking rapidly into it like some frantic auctioneer, and I was glad to know by this that the police would soon be arriving. What I did not know, was that they’d be arriving for me.

“Lady, lady,” I said, in an attempt to placate the old woman’s warbles. “It is all settled. The assailant is down for the count.”

“But you’re a karate boy,” she said, dumbfounded.

“Yes,” I responded. “I am a karate boy. A triple black belt. I know the art well.”

“Oh, I could just die!” she said with a hand to her head as if in a faint. “A karate boy in our quiet little town!”

“Put your hands up!” said a voice from behind me.

I turned to regard the two officers with their pistols drawn. “It’s not me you want, officers. My assailant here has been incapacitated.” I gestured to the floored dip shit.

“I said hands up!”

I complied, becoming uncertain if they understood the situation. I eyed the clerk for some assistance and she shrank from my gaze.

“Certainly you are mistaken, officers,” I said, with my hands stretched up high above my head. “It was this man that came for me. With a weapon, at that. There.” I nodded my head to the side and the officers glanced briefly at the flyswatter at the old woman’s feet.

“Put your hands behind your back, please. Wrists together.”

I did as I was bid and the one officer attached cuffs to my wrists with a forcefulness that made me want to kiss him. “Officers, if I may, what exactly am I being arrested for?”

“Karate,” they said in tandem.

It was then that my assailant regained consciousness and stirred from the floor. “Bzzz, bzzz.” He said and smiled at me. Then he took off at a sprint for the door and was gone as fast as five thousand dollars from the bank.

Subsequently, I was carried away in a cruiser and then placed in a small cell, where I was uncuffed and left to wait and wonder. No sleep came to me that night, and no body came to me with news, so I spent the time admiring the blandness of the walls and all the guilt they seemed to exude. But the feeling did not enter me, because I was innocent and when I was spoken to the next morning by a burly chief, I was indignant and obnoxious in my remonstrance.

I was released without probable cause, and while they returned to me my possessions, which consisted only of the change from my five thousand dollars, some of which was spent upon the couch that I had not as yet acquired, I was told with a baleful glare from the corpulent woman behind the window that I did have a visitor.

“Now?” I said.

She said not a word, but gestured with her eyes, and then once again I was met with the smiling, pimply face of the r/nosleep author who had fallen victim to poor titles and even poorer stories.

“Man,” I said. “I thought you’d have learned your lesson by now. If it’s punishment you like, then maybe your father did you favours all along.”

“My daddy didn’t do shit,” he said.

“He did. He abused you, boy.”

He stomped his feet up and down. “My daddy didn’t do diddly-squat! It was the house-fly, I seen it with my own eyes. It spoked to me, it did!”

“Prove it,” I said.

“Fine,” he said and rushed over to me. “I’ll show you, then, and then you delete that comment cause my feelings are raw with hurt since you left it, and yer made me real sad.”

“Hey!” I said. “Stay back, punk! I know karate.”

“I ain’t goin’ to hurt you, swear, I don’t even got my flyswatter no more. Come here, gimme a lil kiss.”

“You want that?”

“Yeah, come here.”

“You like that?”

“Yeah, come here, come here, lemme show ya.”

And so he pressed his lips to mine and suddenly I wasn’t in the police station anymore. The walls around me became crudely painted dry-wall, and I was sitting on a stiff mattress in a small bedroom. Footsteps from somewhere else in the house grew louder as they approached this room, and then they stopped outside the closed door. The knob slowly turned and the door swung open to reveal the heavily bearded face of a burly old man, and in his hand was a flyswatter.

“Hey there, lil boy,” said this man with a queer smile on his lips. “I’ma getcha!”

“No, daddy, no,” I said, but it wasn’t my words. I was acting out a play.

“I ain’t yer daddy, lil boy. Bzzz, bzzz.”

“Don’t swat at me no more. I’ll give you food. I’ll make you a banana.”

And then the old man opened his mouth and a bloated house-fly crawled off the tongue, and the man crumpled lifeless to the floor.

The house-fly zipped around my head a few times, then it hovered in front of me.

“Please, little fly,” I said. “Leave me and my daddy alone.”

The fly zipped around my head again and crawled into my ear. It was a disturbing sensation, but it didn’t spelunk its way very far in. And it spoke.

“Tell my story, lil boy. Tell my story and I’ll leave you alone forever.”

“But I don’t know what happened,” I said to the empty room.

“I know what happened,” said the fly. “I know why.”

Indeed, it did know, and for the next several minutes it recounted to me the gruesome tale of a human man known as Daddy who came around each corner and up and down every flight of stairs with a big squishy sword killing the family of a poor little fly.

After the tale was heard, the fly crawled out of my head, zipped around the room and resumed his place in the mouth of the old lifeless man. A moment later, the man rose on wobbly legs.

“Tell my story, lil boy. Do it. Do it. Goodbye now.”

The man ran to the window and pried it open, wiggling himself through it.

“Wait!” I shouted. “Wait! Daddy don’t have wings! Wait!”

But it was too late. The old man leapt from the sill and fell flat on his face two stories below. He hit the pavement with a splat and the sound of broken bones was heard above the wind.

Back came the fly, in through the window, zip-zip around the room, until once more hovering before my eyes. Zip around my head and into my ear.

“Sorry, lil boy. I gotta go a lil deeper this time.”

“No!” I screamed, and stuck a finger in my ear to kill him, but he had crawled in far.

“Your daddy’s bones don’t work anymore. I’m sorry but I can’t use him in that condition.”

Everything faded and I was back at the police station. The r/nosleep author had released his kiss and a thin strand of saliva stuck from my lip to his.

“You’re magic,” I said.

“You like that, baby?”

“Stop!” came a shrill voice from down the hall. “In the name of the law!”

“What now?” I said.

“Kissing! You boys were kissing! That’s illegal!”

“It’s illegal to have a little kiss?” I said.

“Yes! Oh my god! It’s so illegal. Oh my god, gross, you did kisses right here at my workplace? I’m going to have to quit my job out of disgust. Go to jail, you two! And no playing Xbox tonight.”

The words terrified me more than the story of the Chinese girl with the broken feet. I started crying. Wailing, really, like a big, big baby.

“What is the matter, son?” asked the police officer.

“I want to play Xbox,” I cried. “It’s not fair!”

“I didn’t mean to scare you, little guy,” said the police officer. He put his arm around me and used his index finger to circle my nipples through my shirt, turning them erect. “You wanna get out of here?”

I used this opportunity to whisper softly into the man’s ear, I said, “Listen up, and listen well. This guy beside me, well he ain’t no guy at all. There’s a fly in his brain and it’s putting him on like a puppet show. I saw it in the kiss, and if you want us all to get out of here alive you have to let me do karate.”

“Okay. And then you wanna get out of here?”

“Sure, whatever.”

“Netflix and chill?”

“Yes.”

“I like you.”

“I like you too.”

“Okay, do your thing, baby.”

I turned toward the r/nosleep author and with all the authority I could muster, I said,

“Fly Man! I condemn your evil deeds straight back into Hell! I refuse! I refuse! I will not delete my comment! I refuse! I refuse! You are but of the lowliest of the low! Born into maggots that feed greedily from the dead to transform with stomachs full of vile filth into buzzing insects that deserve no place on this Earth! I will squish you! I refuse! I refuse! I will swat you to death with hands as dexterous as any flyswatter! Submit!”

The r/nosleep author folded on dead limbs as the house-fly crawled out of his mouth. It zipped around the room, too fast to keep track of, but I had karate eyes. When it came toward my butt, I spun and kicked, missing it by an inch.

The lady behind the desk threw her hands to her face and squealed. “Karate boy! There’s a karate boy here! Kill him!”

“Linda, no!” said the officer. “I’ve allowed it.”

“Oh, okay,” she said, and went back to her paperwork.

Meanwhile, the fly was buzzing around my head, making me dizzy. I could tell that it was looking for an orifice to enter so that it could pilot my brain. I kept my mouth sealed, and with lightspeed hands, I snatched two pairs of ear plugs out of the air as the officer tossed them to me. I shoved two in my ears, and two in my nostrils. My eye sockets were inaccessible thanks to my eyeballs, but I still had an unplugged butt, and a penis hole.

The fly zip-zipped, and then unzipped my pants.

“No!” I screamed. “He’s trying to get into my dick!”

“Not on my watch,” said the officer, and tossed me his watch.

I fastened the watch around the shaft of my penis for to collapse the tunnel, should the fly crawl in my dick hole.

That left only my ass. I looked at the officer, hoping for some help, but he only shrugged.

“Ugh, fine,” said Linda, from behind her desk. She stood up and stuck a hand down the back of her trousers. Her face contorted as she struggled with something down there, and then there was an audible pop, and she offered me a ruby butt-plug.

I grabbed it, saw the poopoo on it, thanked the lord for the nose plugs, and then shoved the butt-plug into my butt.

“Try to get me now, you wicked fly! You scare me some, but you don’t scare me lots no more! You’re just a puny little house-fly.”

“I wish he were dead,” said the officer. “I wish he were dead so that we could get outta here.”

“If wishes were horses, I’d have a ranch,” I said. “Lucinda Willams said that.”

The officer turned his hand to a fist and made a blow job motion with it while using his tongue in his cheek to mimic a penis.

Here came the fly, zipping down at me like a kamikaze fighter plane, but I allowed him no satisfaction, because I cartwheeled away, and then I somersaulted into the air and swung my arms around in quick karate chops. The fly dodged my chops gracefully and I saluted him for his agility.

The fly zipped all about, hitting me in the face, giving me welts and bruises. He was simply 2Fast4Me. I realized that all my orifices had been plugged for several minutes, and the reason I was slow was because I was not getting enough oxygen. I wasn’t breathing at all!

I opened my mouth and pulled in a deep breath. The fly took this opportunity to charge me, but I anticipated this maneuver. So with breath in my lungs, I was able to match its speed, and as it came for my mouth, I reached out with my hand and with karate precision, I snatched the fly out of the air.

Victory was mine. I had the creature in my fist and I felt it stirring and trying to escape. I took it between my finger and thumb and raised it to my eyes. Its wings beat at my fingernails in anxious despair.

“Respite, young fly!” I said, in my authoritarian voice. “Submit! Let us see what you are made from.”

I raised the fly to my lips and gave it a lil kiss.

My perspective changed. I had not two eyes, and I could not focus on one individual thing. I was seeing through a thousand lenses at once, and the world formed around me in every direction; up, down, back, front, and I could see it all.

I was resting on the carcass of a horse, and all around me were other flies like me. My family. Deep within a wound, squirming amidst the blackened flesh of the dead horse, were my children. I loved them so, so much. I still do. My little fly heart is broken, and nothing at all could offer it repair. I regarded my children with pride, and longed to stay in this moment, in this wistful memory, oh heaven, heaven, along the surfaces of this dead beast, heaven, here! Here! Heaven is here! Along the silky coat, and within the murky flesh, we have found it at last. Heaven, heaven.

The fly stole deeper into my lips, a kiss of death, my own doing. Why are humans such curious things? Why must they stick their heads into places that they don’t belong? What a foolish mistake, to not vanquish one’s foe, but to force their way into them. Rape! Rape! That is all that humans do, at every opportunity. I didn’t belong in that memory. I wasn’t welcome there.

He wasn’t welcome there. No, not at all, bzzz, bzzz. Hahaha! No, not at all!
