Strings of thick saliva and blood clung to my chin as the hellish sounds of a dying parasite thrashed in the toilet water. Hyperventilating gasps filled my burning lungs with cool air seemingly for the first time ever. On the cool tile, my knee caps shifted uncomfortably as I hunched to the ground. I stumbled uncontrollably to get to my feet as I used the dirty toilet rim for support. Teeth gnashed as the drowning creature fought for oxygen. 

I knew I was high, but I also knew I wasn't hallucinating this creature. The bottle of Eupho, the hit new psychedelic, lay drained on its side as my world melted away and rebuilt itself in front of my very eyes. Even as the colors pulsated and the walls breathed, the nature of the creature remained unmasked. No perspective could change the appearance of this thing now that it’s out in the open. 

I had no idea what I was going to do in the morning. I was worried they would all know I was rejected by the Nerium. Sweat beaded and dripped into my eyes, burning my dilated pupils as the drug ran its course. I was glued to the floor as the stars danced just beyond my ceiling. The rest of the night faded away as my consciousness explored the cosmic beyond. 

My heart jumped out of my chest as my alarm screamed from across the bathroom. It’s morning, and I have to be out of this space in the next fifteen minutes. A sore back and popping bones proved that I had slept hard enough not to move at all during the night. I was sober again. Like, really sober. Off the floor and over the sink, I looked at myself in the mirror. The dried blood that was soaked into my shirt stared at me as I gathered the courage it would take to examine the toilet. Was it really gone? I didn’t have a lot of time, so I had to find the fortitude sooner rather than later. Down, my eyes shifted to the position they would need to be in to see, but my head refused to follow at first. 

Slowly, the toilet came into sight. To my horror, blood trailed out and over the rim. A slimy red residue led my eyes to the locked bathroom door as it continued underneath the gap that shined a sliver of daylight into the porcelain crypt that my worldview died in. I scrambled to unlock the door, and the sun blinded me as it glared off the window across the hall. Down the hallway, crusty black stains stopped at the utility closet midway to the end of the corridor. Quickly, I tracked the blotches and found myself manicly opening the small door and searching the ground for the carcass.

“Honey?”

The voice moved my bones and stopped my heart. Standing just a few inches away, a crescent grin glistened. My mother leaned in and examined my face closely. 

“Is something wrong?” She asked, ignoring the mess. “You aren’t smiling!”

I stared at my mother, unable to even feign a smile. For the first time ever, I was able to examine her face with a critical lens. A cloudiness no longer festered in my brain, allowing my eyes to convey reality more accurately. And it scared the hell out of me. 

“Uh,” I began. My mind raced, but I couldn’t think of how to communicate with this person I’ve known since birth. The blank, soulless gaze stripped me of any kind of confidence that once resided in my psyche. The corners of her mouth cracked as she pulled her lips back into the same expression I’ve seen my whole life. A sore pain in my cheekbones and mouth ached as my empathy subtly reminded me that I knew how she felt. My face only relaxed for the first time last night. “I don’t really feel like smiling.”

My mother’s upper lip buckled slightly as her eyebrows raised a touch more than they already were, “Oh dear. Well, you better start feeling it soon. We leave in five minutes.” She said with an upper inflection that indicated a level of skepticism. She turned around and headed towards my sister’s door. 

My neck loosened as soon as she was out of sight, letting my focus wander back to the creature in the closet. Or where it’s supposed to be. From scanning to searching to moving every item in the closet, nothing concluded with a body. Out of time, I had to abandon the scene to join my family. I tried my best to put on my best fake smile, and I went downstairs. I got in the car alongside my sister and father, and we waited quietly for my mom to join us. It took a bit longer than usual, but no one else seemed to notice or be bothered by the unusual delay. After a bit longer, Mother found her way into the passenger's seat. She gave a friendly chuckle as her seat belt clicked before allowing her gaze to fall on me for a bit longer than a passing glance. 

In the middle of downtown, the Temple of Nerium greeted us like it did every day, with joyful trumpets and harmonious singing. It was a beautiful building with intricate architecture and art all dedicated to the parasite. Gorgeous pillars and relief carvings decorated the outside of the travertine stone structure, and stained glass depicting the story of the original Nerium parasite filtered light colorfully into a large nave inside. We did not go into the building to worship. The service always took place outside of the Temple in a large square. 

Hundreds of people with unchanging smiles swarmed from all over the county to worship the parasite our people spent generations infecting children with. Today was the weekly Affusion. All the newborns in the area were brought to the Temple to receive the gift of Nerium. One by one, families watch as their beloved newborn is held over a vat of swarming parasites. Men scoop the Nerium out to find the perfect match for the screaming babies, and you knew it worked once one latched to their mouths to silence the noise. Once we arrived, they were already a quarter of the way through the few newborns not yet inflicted. 

It was supposed to be yet another joyace day, but I found myself actually horrified at the sounds of choking infants exciting the crowd around me. We all had the same thing done, but I felt like an outsider for the first time. Energy surged through the people clapping along to the music being performed as the last of the children ceased their crying permanently. Only a few died this time, and the crowd was electric with excitement. This made it obvious that I wasn’t experiencing the same thing as all of the other heads fixated on the Temple. It wasn’t in the parasite's nature to allow its victims basic critical thinking, and that disallowed even basic investigation of their surroundings. Scanning the crowd wasn’t what a Nerist would do, yet my eyes met with one other person. My mother.

I averted eye contact and tried to enjoy the worship as normal, but fear started to cripple me the more I saw this tradition for what it was. The Wise One arrived on the balcony of the main building of the square to address the crowd. He was a man, older than any other, that swayed back and forth as he approached the railing above the sea of infected people. He was known as the Wise One because he was the only human to survive the Nerium’s lifecycle past the age of forty in my county. He has experienced at least thirty additional years ruling the people around me. Even though most parasites and hosts die after their lifecycles, this particular Nerium continued to overtake his body. A matured creature resembling the one from the toilet peeked out of his throat as he spoke through a plastered smile. Small tendrils were lightly visible as they controlled his eyes from within the sockets. The puppeted carcass was once a human, but he was consumed from within. 

“From within, we conquer.” The Nerium hissed through the man’s teeth.

“And to conquer comes from within.” The crowd chanted back in unison.

For nearly an hour, rhetoric praising the glory of the parasite they allowed to consume their brain flooded their ears. The levels of consciousness varied, so the sermon only confirmed a sort of self worship amongst the Nerium infiltrated into our society. If the parasite didn't kill them, it consumed them. And I only saw it for the first time today. After just a brief appearance, Wise One left the public view and wouldn't return until the next day. We wrapped the event with a hymn that reverberated sloppily written adoration for the beloved parasite. As someone who had it in them, our intense happiness was synonymous with our infection. Now that I was free, nothing seemed more disturbing than the Nerium.

My father drove us home as he droned on and on about how amazing the service was. He, of course, grinned ear-to-ear as he quizzed each of us on details of Nerism. He was on the losing end of his thirties, and he was the same person now as he was when he was a middle-aged twenty year old. The same as everyone else: a blind zealot nearing the end of his boring life. My mother sat silently as always and listened, and I would often see her eyes studying me through the mirror. My sister stared blankly at the seat in front of her, giggling happily. No one besides my mom seemed to even notice I wasn't acting myself. 

Once we were home, I retreated upstairs and secluded myself to find my Nerium. Frantically, I looked in every single space it could have weaseled itself into, but to no avail. My heart began to race as a sense of hopelessness ripped at my heart. Anxiety was a brand new sensation to me, but the very feeling that plagued my every thought also made me feel more alive than ever. It put what happiness was into a proper perspective, and I would have never understood the beauty of the human condition without experiencing unpleasant feelings, too. 

All of these thoughts taxed my brain as I returned to my bedroom to lay on my bed and decompress. As epiphanies worked themselves out in my head, that very fear being finally understood reared its ugly head again. Inside my room, my mother sat in the chair in the corner, waiting for me. 

With a big smile, she asked, “Can you close the door, sweetie?”

The request chilled me to my core, but an infected person wouldn't hesitate. I silently reached up and pushed the door close. When I turned around, my mother was standing right behind me. I came face-to-face with an inquisitive furrowed brow, relaxed cheekbones, and a haunting frown. Head to toe, she examined me. 

“It really is gone, isn't it?” She whispered. She reached a clammy hand up to my beet-red face. “If it didn't crawl back in, where is it?”

Her eyes intensely shifted back and forth as I stuttered. “I-uh-I don't know. I passed out after it left me.” 

Her hands found their way to my shoulders, pressing her fingers into my skin. She pulled me slightly closer as she leaned in to consume my vision with nothing but her eyes. A hot exhale suffocated me for only a moment before she made her move. She pulled me in and hugged me tightly. A motherly embrace melted my heart in an instant as I nearly collapsed with emotion. Joy, confusion, and peace all at once welled tears in my eyes. 

Trying to catch my breath, I struggled to ask, “When did yours leave?”

“A long time ago.” She cooed. A soft hand brushed the back of my hair as my knees weakened from the visceral buzzing of love. We swayed back and forth, slightly rotating as we squeezed tight for what felt like hours. We had turned a full 180 degrees, switching the positions we were in originally. She seemed to do this on purpose so she could allow me the safe space of my room and her exit. She had to return to my father so she didn’t raise suspicion. 

But it was too late. 

When I opened my soaking eyes, through the tears, the unmistakable grin of my father stood over us in the doorway. 

“Everything okay in here?” He hissed through his teeth as he came into the light, revealing his eyes. They were being gripped by the Nerium the same way the Wise One’s were. He was just now getting taken by the parasite, and he was in that crucial moment of life and death. A hyperventilating gasp choked him as he grinned ear to ear. 

My mother stiffened, dropping her arms from around me and standing up straight. With a big smile, she turned to my father with a high pitch, “Hi honey!” They stared at each other briefly before she shuffled past him, grabbing his arm to guide him out of my room. 

“Wait,” my father coughed. “I have something for my child.” 

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a dense item wrapped thickly in several paper towels. They both left as soon as it hit my hands, and the silence rang in my ears as my chest pounded. This paper towel gift wrapped present began to wriggle in my hands. Layer by layer, I removed the packaging to reveal one final blood-soaked napkin.

I peeled it off, and my Nerium screeched. An involuntary yelp from my lungs caused the parasite to leap from my hands and into my mouth. It latched to my tongue with its sharp teeth, and it tore into my skin with barbed tendrils. My body convulsed as I lost my balance onto my bed. On my back, I arched up wildly as I clawed at my face in a desperate attempt to defend myself from the wretched creature. 

This was not going to happen again. 

With the will of my newfound life, I clenched my teeth tightly, severing the head of my lifelong illness. Guts squished out of my mouth and onto my sheets, causing me to gag. I spit the creature out and caught my breath for only a moment before getting to my feet. I needed to check on my mother. I ran down the hall and towards my parents’ room. The door was locked, and I knocked urgently. 

“Mom?” I yelled through the door. “Dad?”

I pressed my ear to the door and heard nothing for a few seconds. That was until a slight stomping sound thudded in succession on the other side. It wasn’t a smoking gun, but what else did I really have to lose? My shoulder rammed into the door a few times before I tried using my foot. I didn't care about my already damaged body, and the hairline fractures developing in my shin proved it as I knocked the door flat. 

Inside the room, a matured Nerium fully emerged from my father's throat as he struggled to breathe. Its sharp spine nearly touched the ceiling as gurgling salivia poured down my father's cheeks. The parasite's jagged teeth ripped onto the flesh of my mother's decapitated corpse. Long arms resembling a praying mantis held her lifeless body close as the Nerium’s mouth stretched around her shoulders and continued to consume her body whole. It hunched over more as it worked its way inch by inch down her body. As it moved out of my father's mouth to shred her bones, it cracked his jaw. 

“Oh my god, mom!” I screamed. The parasite gripped its teeth tightly, separating half of my mother's body on the ground with a thud. It turned its attention to me as it gulped down strings of hanging skin. Before I knew it, I was pulled in, and the sharp teeth of my father's illness sunk into my shoulder. My feet lifted from the ground as I kicked wildly at the beast, but to no avail. 

My blood squirted out of my neck as my vision faded slightly. Hallucinations of a double reality separated as black trickled into sight. Memories of my mom subtly protecting me and watching over my growth with a bond only a mother could have with their child flashed in my mind. I saw her, but I never actually noticed due to this damn parasite. 

Just as consciousness started to fade away, my father's weak hands grabbed ahold of the squirming Nerium and yanked at the body. Hope surged through me as I found the strength for one final struggle against the beast. 

“Dad! Bite down!” I screeched as I landed several jabs to the parasite's eyes. I had already forgotten the Nerium had broken his jaw. With a few closed fist punches to his own face, a snapping crunch caused the Nerium to scuttle dramatically on the ground as we both broke free. Half alive, my dad and I combined our ambition together and pounced on the disgusting creature. 

We kicked in its head and ripped off its arms as we attacked it with everything we had. It was surprisingly fragile given how much power it had over people. The flattened monster decorated our shoes with my mother's blood as we made sure it could never reinfect my father. Two corpses and gallons of blood greeted my dad to the real world. The facts of reality may be painful, but not as painful as watching my father become a puppet for a filthy murderous parasite. 

We were just one of millions affected by the Nerium. We may never win, but it is worth the fight. As long as this damnable parasite feeds on our society and rules the foundations of our laws and customs, there will be victims suffering. If I can stop the Nerium from swallowing just one other family, I will do everything in my power to fight this illness. Even as the passion burned, a hopeless dread put the reality of our situation into perspective. We were only two people amongst a nation full of Nerium crazed fanatics, and we still had to grieve for the first time in our lives. Tears of relief, anguish, rage, and mourning hit us both in stages. Our bodies, no matter how damaged, belonged to us now. 

Only a moment passed before the creaking of our steps caught our attention. 

“Daddy?” My sister said, standing in the doorway with a huge smile.
