\---------------------------------------

Among the horrors of the infinite subway, going from incomprehensible beings to your fellow man, who you wouldn't know whether or not he is an ally or if he is ready to backstab you at the drop of a hat, there is another insidious mind killer: monotony. Miles and miles of the same exact cart, the pitch darkness that is ever present outside of the subway, the same smell of old plastic, the utter silence occasionally broken by a flickering light bulb... It's enough to get you eventually.

Or at least, it would've been for me, if I didn't have Marie and the rest of the group with me. We've been walking for what feels like weeks now, barely checking my phone from time to time to conserve battery. I am at 75% percent right now, which might seem like a lot, but we haven't seen another wall socket since we left our base behind. These updates, despite them being draining on my battery, are another reason I can keep going. In my mind, it serves as a sort of journal, one that, hopefully, reaches back to my old world, so that someone, especially my family, might read it and know what happened to me.

I will have to rewind time a bit, back to after we dealt with Jaques and his group of men. I don't think anyone managed to get a wink of sleep after what we saw, given the fact that when I "woke up", everyone had the same tired look on their faces. Marie, however, was sleeping next to me, cuddling against my shoulder, holding me like I was some sort of giant teddy bear.

"Nooo... I said I don't want onions in my burger..." she said, still asleep. Despite what we went through, she was still able to make me feel like everything is ok.

"Yaaaaawn... Good morning everyone!" Marie mumbled. "How is everyone?"

"We're tired, kid," replied Matt, shuffling to put himself in a more comfortable position, "so don't be so loud."

"Sorry, sorry..." 

"Eh, it's alright, just... mind the noise."

"She wasn't being loud!" piped in Helen, slightly annoyed. "She was just being nice to y'all!"

"One," retorted Matt, "I know she was being nice, and two, you're not one to talk about what's loud and what not."

"And, pray tell, what is that supposed to mean?"

"It means that you're also quite loud when you speak.", said John.

"Hmph." said Helen, crossing her arms, "Well, someone has to be loud enough to get through your thick skull, Matt!"

"And someone needs to know when to stay silent so we won't get busted..." mumbled Matt.

"Hey!" yelled Marie, suddenly jumping and standing up, "Don't fight over nothing!"

"Who said we were fighting?" replied Helen, giving Marie a confused look.

"Yea, this is normal talk between us. Don't worry about it" added Matt.

I could see Marie's face going red from embarrassment.

"Haha, it's alright girl, it did look like we were fighting. By the way, we haven't had the pleasure," Helen said, going for a handshake. "Name's Helen. It's nice to finally have another girl in this guy party."

"And I'm Marie."

"Oooh, now that's a strong handshake! Think I'm gonna like you. Better watch out Anthony, or I might just come in and sweep her of ya!"

I gave her a pretty annoyed look at that remark.

"Relaaax, I was just joking. Had a girlfriend before coming in here, and I am anything but a cheater. Darling was the apple of my eye..." she said, looking sad for a second, but quickly shaking it off "Besides, I saw you two while sleeping. Couldn't take her off of ya even if I tried."

Both me and Marie were beet red at that point.

"Helen dear," said Gertrude, "why don't you leave the two alone and start with breakfast? Think everyone's hungry."

"Yea! We are!" said Michael and Gabriel in unison.

"It would be nice to have something to eat" said John

Everyone kept saying they'd like to eat. Everyone except Nick, who sat alone in the other corner of the Cart, hidden behind the chairs.

"Alrighty then!" said Helen. "One Rat patty coming up!"

She took the rat meat from one of the makeshift fridges and put it on the lower pipes, where it began sizzling. Soon enough, everyone began eating.

"Do you have anything else to eat in that backpack of yours?"

"Hmm, I think I still have some soup and some chicken tenders. Some marshmallows and chocolate too"

"What are those?" said Gabriel, who overheard us.

"What do you mean what are those?"

"Never heard of anything of what you said. We grew up in this place. Is that some kind of animal?"

Marie's eyes widened.

"Oh you poor things! You should have some!"

Helen extended her arm and said, "Give it here, I'll warm those up real quick!"

Soon enough, the smell of chicken filled in the cart.

"IT'S DELICIOUS!" said Michael, who finished his piece as soon as he got it

"THANK YOU SO MUCH!" said Gabriel, who finished his even faster.

"I'm glad you liked it!" Marie looked around the cart and said "You guys have been here for a while right?" said Marie. "You can have some as well if you want!"

"Don't mind if I do!" said Helen, who tore a piece of the chicken really quick.

"Only a little bit." said John.

"Likewise." added Emily.

"I'll pass. I'm full of rat right now." said Matt.

"That is very kind of you dear, but you should save it for yourselves. I'm more than happy with the rat Helen cooked for us." said Gertrude.

Nick remained silent.

Helen, noticing that Nick wasn't saying anything, stood up from the pipes and went to him. She looked right at him and said. "Not hungry?"

Nick whispered a very soft "Not really..." before everyone heard his stomach rumbling. 

"Really? You sure?" said Helen.

"Look, I appreciate the thought, but I don't deserve it. Not after what we've done to you all. I'm not sure why I'm even here still. I'll just go now..." Nick began to rise, but Helen put her hand on his shoulder and forced him to sit back down.

"Your guys were assholes, yes. And, despite how horrifying it looked, I am really glad that they got eaten by the Conductor."

"Then why-"

"Let me finish. With that being said, you didn't look like you were enjoying yourself, not like them... And, I still remember you giving us bandages when you could"

"And," I interrupted Helen, "without you, I don't think we could've sneaked in that ticket to Jaques."

"Right! See?" said Helen, giving him a bit of chicken tender. "Come eat with us."

Nick began tearing up. He took the chicken and followed Helen, finally sitting along with the rest of us.

"Righto! Now that everyone is full," said Helen, feeling pumped up, "I feel like a little bit of hunting is in order!"

"Hunting?" asked Marie.

"Indeed! When I looked in the fridge, I saw we were running low on meat, so we should go and hunt some! We're lucky however that asshole's group had a bunch of water saved up!"

"Ooooh, can I come?"

"Glad you asked! Someone has to show you how we get around these parts!"

"And I," said John "also want to go check up on the traps I've set up. Anthony, want to join me?"

"Sure."

"Great! We won't need to go too far, mainly 'cause we're not that  low. One hundred carts each is enough for now."

"Let's go then!"

With that, me and Marie parted ways for now, her and Helen going in one direction while me and John went the other. As we walked along, he was showing me all the make shift traps he set up in the carts, like small boxes the rats can enter but can't get out of and some small noose strings meant to catch the rats legs. Once the rat was caught, he showed me how he killed it with his knife and how to check for the good meat. Weirdly enough, I wasn't off-put by that sight.

"We also boil them first to eliminate any bacteria they might have."

"Must've taken quite a while for you to figure out all that stuff."

"Oh you bet! We're lucky we found Helen pretty soon after landing here, otherwise I'm not sure if we would've survived."

"Kind of like how Matt helped me."

"Exactly. Now, I have to ask..."

John's tone changed to be more father-like.

"You and that girl, Marie. Are you serious about her?"

"Of course I am! We've been together for five years now!"

"And, might I ask, why haven't you proposed yet?"

I felt a big rush of pain flowing when I heard that question.

"I... I was about too. Before I came here. Was saving up for a ring for a while, and once I got it, I would've proposed where we first met. Once I got here, I didn't know what to do. I was scared I would never see her again... Still feels like a dream that we found each other in here, even if I'm scared that something might happen to her any moment."

John gave me a big smile and put his hand on my shoulder, looking me straight in the eyes. Studying his face more carefully, I saw that he had a small scar on his lips, barely hidden by a patchy beard.

"Atta boy. You remind me of myself a little when I got here with my wife. I felt the same exact thing as you do now, doubly so, considering she was pregnant with our boys at the time. You have to learn that she's not as helpless as you think."

"I know, I just, I don't want to lose her again."

"I understand Anthony. That feeling will always be there. For me, it still is. But you will learn to live with it."

Saying that, he took of a golden ring he was wearing and said: 

"Here. This is my wedding ring. I will ask Emily to give you her ring as well so that you can do it properly"

I was in complete disbelief

"I couldn't possibly-"

"No no no, I insist," John stopped me, putting the wedding ring in my hand and closing it. "I already know who I'm married to, and besides, if Emily heard about this, she would've done the same thing. It's time for these rings to be put on some new hands."

I put the ring in my pocket and went and gave John a big hug. He hugged me back, patting my head slightly, saying. "It's ok Anthony. It's ok."

After I finished hugging him, he said: "Think we have enough meat for now. Let's head back and bring in the haul."

A while later, we arrived back to base, right as Helen and Marie were back.

"Sure looks like you got a good haul eh?" said John to Helen.

"Right back at ya! Though we can brag a little bit more cause we found some tickets as well!"

"Nice! We should be good for a while on both water and food."

"Finally, some good news around here!" said Matt, hearing him being a tad happier than usual.

Everyone then began hanging out with each other. John, Emily, Matt and Gertrude were talking about old history stuff, Gabriel and Michael were running around the carts playing tag, Nick and Helen were chatting as they put the meat in the fridges, while I put my phone in the socket to charge a bit and cuddled with Marie.

"Does your internet still work?"

"Yeah, why?"

"Wanna watch a movie?"

Hearing that, I realized I haven't had the time to show everyone what my phone can do.

"Hey everyone!" I yelled, "Wanna watch a movie?"

They looked confused.

"How?" asked Matt. "Last time I checked, we don't have a cinema close by."

"On this." And I showed my phone to them.

"Oh nice, you have a phone with you!" said Nick and Helen at the same time.

"You don't?"

"Jaques confiscated ours when we got here. Said they were "important and in need for safekeeping. He then went and lost them. So much for "safekeeping"."

"As for me, I forgot it home." added Helen.

"A movie? What's that?" asked Michael.

"You'll see. Now, what movie do you want to watch?"

"You still didn't explain how we'll watch a movie here of all places." said Matt.

I then proceeded to open the internet and look for a movie site. I also told him about how does it work.

"It's kind of like a small TV where I can search for everything."

Besides me, Marie, Helen and Nick, everyone was looking amazed as Matt fiddled around with it.

"We should watch something with adventure!" said Marie. "With everything around us being so gloomy and samey, we might as well have some fun!"

"What comedy though?" I asked.

"How about  The Lord of the Rings Trilogy?" asked John.

"I always loved those movies! I still remember seeing them with you when they first appeared." said Emily.

"Lord of the Rings it is then!"

I then put on the first movie as everyone sat around the phone, still in the socket. As the movie played, the kids were surprised to see everything that was happening, from the other people on the screen, to stuff we normally don't think about, such as the sky, the sun, grass, trees, etc. Everyone was explaining to them what those things were as me and Marie sat quietly, our backs against the doors. I closed my eyes a little bit, wanting to relax.

"It was a good idea you suggested this." I told Marie as I patted her head.

"Right? It feels like we're having a movie night with family and friends."

"Yeah... The kids being a bit too loud, the rest trying to quiet them down or tell them about the movie..."

"Not to mention the popcorn smell!"

"The popcorn sme-?"

I suddenly inhaled deeply, praying that it wasn't what I thought it was, but sure enough...

It was a smell of salt.

My face grew pale the moment I realized it and jumped up, quickly dragging Marie with me and grabbing my phone.

"RUN!" I yelled at everyone, as the carts behind us were starting to go pitch black.

They realized what was going on and began grabbed whatever they could as quickly as possible. John and Emily got the kids, Nick got his gun and his backpack, Helen picked up Gertrude, who was small enough to be carried around. They then all began running. All, except Matt, who was still sitting down.

"WHAT ARE YOU DOING???" I yelled at him. 

"I can't run with this leg, kid. I'd just drag you down and get you killed."

"Oh for fuck's sake!" I yelled and went back for him.

"Kid, I appreciate the gesture, but you can't carry me on your own."

"He is not alone though!" yelled Marie as she ran back as well.

"Both of you are idiots..." said Matt, however smiling a little bit as me and Marie began carrying him, one arm on each of our shoulders.

John was in front of us, opening the doors and leaving them open. The darkness was closing in on us, the figure of the Janitor being visible in front of it. Looking behind, he was definitely not as pristine as the Conductor normally is. While the Conductor was somewhat composed, the Janitor was far more chaotic, as the barely visible red man was bouncing around the cart, shaking and trembling as if he was a junkie craving a fix. To say it was terrifying sight would be an understatement. 

When we got twenty carts away from the base, the Janitor almost caught us. The cart behind us got dark and we were too far away to get to the next one. Fortunately, it stopped right then and there. Everyone took a moment to catch their breath as the lights began to turn back on where the Janitor was. Afterwards, we began walking back, and when we did eventually get back...

We were greeted by nothing. Everything we had, the fridges, the food, the water, the wall socket... All was gone and replaced by a cart, identical as all the ones we've been in. Some of the group was looking frantically. Others broke down crying. I just sat there in complete shock, trying not to lose it again. Eventually however, we had to accept the reality that we lost everything we didn't carry with us when we ran away.

And we began walking. Walking the same, boring carts over and over for days on end, only stopping to sleep, hunt, get tickets and deal with the Conductor. We haven't seen the Janitor since then either. No one really spoke with each other for quite some time, bar the occasional find or a Conductor announcement. That was until we found a body.

In one of the carts, there was a skeleton of a man, clutching some sort of leather book with nothing else valuable on him, except for an empty backpack and the clothes he was wearing. Taking the book from the skeletal hands, I opened it and began reading.

"My name is Pablo Ramirez. In the case someone finds this in the wake of my death, I will do my best to document my findings in this journal as I explored the Subway, searching for the Garden and the life-time subscription pass."
