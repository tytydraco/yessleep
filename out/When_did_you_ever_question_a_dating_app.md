I used to swipe without a second thought. Like most people, I just assumed dating apps were a necessary evil, a digital meat market, but ultimately harmless. Just profiles, chats, a few awkward first dates. You know, normal stuff.

When did I ever question a dating app? Never. Not until it led me to Alex.

Her profile wasâ€¦ adequate. Pretty enough, a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes, which I found intriguing. Her bio was a standard collection of interests: hiking, indie music, vintage arcade games. All perfectly acceptable. We matched.

Our initial chats were easy, almost too easy. She flowed well. We talked about her work, her hobbies, what she was binging on Netflix. I found myself subtly guiding the conversation, nudging her towards topics that revealed more about her habits, her routines, her vulnerabilities.

One Tuesday, she mentioned a particularly rough day at work. My fingers flew across the keyboard. "Sounds like you'd be... tender after that," I typed, a small smile playing on my lips. "Hope you get some good rest." She responded with a laughing emoji, completely oblivious. It was always so easy to plant the seeds.

Then came the hiking. She excitedly told me about a solo trip she was planning to a specific, less-known trail. "Perfect weather for that," I messaged back. "Builds up quite an appetite, doesn't it? For... a good meal afterwards, of course." She just said, "Haha, definitely! A big burger for me!" Bless her innocence. She had no idea how right she was about the "appetite."

We finally set up a date. A coffee shop, neutral ground. I arrived early, settled in, and watched her walk in. She was just as I'd anticipated. A little nervous, a little eager. Her scent was... promising.

The conversation started normally. I watched her, absorbing every detail. The way her eyes crinkled when she laughed, the nervous habit of twisting a strand of hair. I mirrored her gestures, a subtle dance of mimicry. If she leaned forward, I leaned forward. If she touched her hair, my hand would brush my own. It was a practice, a way to fully inhabit her space, to understand her rhythms. My eyes, I knew, were fixed on her, but not in an engaged way. It was an appraisal. A careful, meticulous assessment. I caught myself glancing at the soft curve of her throat, the delicate bones of her wrists, the plumpness of her hands.

Then, the moment that confirmed everything.

She was talking about dreams, and I saw my opening. I mentioned a "dream" I'd had. "You know," I said, my voice perfectly calm, "I had the strangest dream last night. It was about a cold, empty space. And a very distinct scent... like iron, but sweet. And a feeling of... anticipation. Like something was about to be prepared."

Her face went white. Her coffee cup clattered against the saucer. Her hands started to shake, violently. "What did you just say?" she whispered.

I tilted my head, my smile, I imagined, perfectly serene. "Just a dream. Weird, right? Anyway, you were saying something about your cat?"

She didn't hear the rest. She stood up abruptly, knocking her chair back. "I... I have to go," she stammered, backing away from the table. The fear in her eyes was a delicious, almost palpable thing.

She practically ran out of the coffee shop. I watched her go, a slow, satisfied warmth spreading through me. She deleted the dating app the moment she got home, I knew. Changed passwords, scrubbed her online presence. She felt violated, exposed. Good. The hunt had begun.

That night, I didn't sleep. I was too excited. Every shadow was an ally. Every sound outside was just the world waiting. I kept picturing Alex's face, her fear, the way her body had tensed.

The next morning, the app was gone from my phone. I scrolled through my photos, a private collection. And then I saw it.

A new photo in my gallery. One I had taken.

It was a selfie. Of me. Sleeping.

And in the very corner of the shot, barely visible in the dim light, was a tall, impossibly thin shadow. Its head long, its mouth a gaping, black tear. The same figure I'd seen in the dark corner of my room, the one I'd described to you. It wasn't a demon. It was me. My true self, revealed in the absence of the world's blinding, judging light. The hunger made manifest.

But this time, on my nightstand, directly in the foreground, was something small, white, and perfectly clean.

A single, human finger bone. Smooth, polished. A memento.

It hadn't just learned her dreams. It had been in her room. And it wasn't just watching. It was *feeding*.

When did I ever question a dating app? I never did. Not when it so efficiently delivered my next meal.
