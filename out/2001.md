(This is my first personally written story.)

In 2001, i was 14. My dad was a mechanical engineer and my mom was a midwife that died giving birth to me. Ironically, she gave birth to me and died in the same hospital that she worked in. 

My dad never liked to talk about my mom, and he really wasnt around much due to his job. This culminated in my dad and i having somewhat of a strained relationship, and i mostly stayed with my grandparents who were both retired, churchgoing folk.

My grandparents loved to talk about my mother, i still remember my grandmother describing how beautiful and kind she was. Everything ive heard from people about my mother has been positive, but not once have i heard it from my dad.

This always seemed suspicious to me, but i always chalked it up to the usual pain of losing a spouse. Yet, something always seemed off about my dad. He was always emotionally vacant, his eyes were like stone and when you would talk to him he would just stare at you coldly, as if he's looking through you.

I knew that because i spent alot of time at my grandparents, that my dad had alot of time to himself and i began to wonder what he did during the time that he wasn't at work. I started noticing his absence from usual visits with me early on. He would normally take me out for awhile to get food and just talk about everything thats going on with the family and with ourselves.

This was something my dad never did, he always at least tried to come and spend time with me whenever he could, but lately his presence in my life was severely lacking.

My suspicion got the better of me, and one day i decided to begin following my father. At first he would go to his usual places, Work, Walmart and sometimes a bar just down the street from his house, but after a few days he began going to houses and apartment buildings that i had never seen, nor been to before.

The possibility of my dad dating was very slim, to put it simply he was devastated by my mother's death and it changed something in him. So, for him to go to these new houses and apartments made no sense. I knew all of my dad's friends and none of them lived in the places that he went to. The oddest thing about it is he would always spend the exact same amount of time in each apartment or house he went to, like a routine.

He would also always come out in a new set of clothes and i would never see the pair he wore before he changed again. I spent 2 weeks following my dad and i ultimately gained more questions than answers. 

(Im going to post this in parts based on the reactions i get, since this is my first time i want to test the waters. If people dont like my writing, i dont want to bore or waste their time with a super long story if they dont like it. I hope you enjoy the first part.)
