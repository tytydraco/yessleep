I thought back to when I was just a boy living near Nacogdoches. I remember me and my friends were exploring a hiking trail somewhere out in eastern Texas. My and 2 other people. We were probably ten or twelve years old at the time. We found a body just off the trail, probably been there a year. He was old, shriveled, twisted, and still dressed in an old t-shirt and shorts. We sprinted back down the trail and ran to the police. They dragged him out of there, asked me questions, and finally when they let me go my mother let me take a week off of school. It traumatized me for years, and in a way I don’t think I ever got over it. 

And now, I felt like I was face to face with that guy again. 

I found my footing and scooped up my flashlight and backed up down the corridor away from Carl’s body. I didn’t take my eyes off of him, not for a second, almost like I was afraid he would suddenly spring up and run after me. Finally I opened the door to the control room and found the night guard sleeping in his chair. I walked in and slammed the button down to turn the lights in the cell block on and he jolted awake. 

“H-hey,” he muttered. “The hell’s goin’ on?”

I ignored him.

With the lights on I went back out to see what I was hoping was an illusion in the closet. It wasn’t. He was still there, bony, yellow, skull sticking through old skin. Quickly I turned away. The night guard, named Jack, stumbled out and looked down the corridor. 

“What? What’s going on?”

My eyes went wide when he said this. I whipped around and threw my hands to the closet. 

“Don't you see?” I yelled.

“See what?” he replied. 

I turned around. Nothing was there. My jaw hit the floor and I stumbled toward the closet. The light was on, everything was as I left it, but Carl. He was gone. Just, gone. I walked over to the closet and started moving, then throwing things out of the way. Buckets, mops, spray bottles of disinfectant. Say for a musty smell, nothing was out of the ordinary.

“Hey man, I don’t know what your doin’, but I ain’t want no part of it.” Jack said and he ducked back into the control panel. I looked back at him with what I assume were wide open eyes and an open mouth. He waved his hand dismissively at me and shut the door.

I stood up and backed up. I looked down the corridor, the lights were still on. The inmate was in his cell. I didn’t want to look at him again. I looked back in the closet one last time and then went back to the break room. 

I did that thing where you put one hand over your eye, like what a child might do when they pass by a creepy painting or statue when I passed by his cell. But I knew that he could see me. He was watching. I went into the break room and shut the door, and made a deliberate point of locking it. Then I went to the table and just sat down.

It was only 11:47 at night. I had over five hours until Greg and Hal came to relieve me of duty and take over the day shift. Five hours. That's a long time to wait.

I wasn’t about to just convince myself that it was a “bad dream” or whatever. I’m not an idiot, I know what I saw. I know exactly what that was. And I also know exactly what it wasn’t, and it wasn’t a hallucination, it wasn’t a product of sleep deprivation, it wasn’t a gas leak, and  it wasn’t a damn ghost. It was real, too real. 

I must have fallen asleep around then, thinking about it because I woke up to Greg shaking me awake on the shoulder. I looked up at him, my hair no doubt in shambles and my face probably pale. I stood up and pushed the chair I had been on aside. Nobody said anything and I shambled my way out into the corridor. I looked back toward the inmate’s cell then quickly looked away. I was scared of him now, that was for sure.

I drove home, and when I got home I crawled into my bed and must have slept for twelve hours straight, because when I woke up it was already 4:30 in the afternoon. I was scheduled to go to work at seven, so I showered and put on a clean uniform before driving back to the prison. I got there and just sat in my car in the parking lot for a while. When I finally walked in I learned a new inmate was scheduled to arrive that day.

Oh, and I also talked to the warden. Apparently the state had decided to try to execute Daryl again that Saturday, noon sharp.

“Governor's orders,” Warden Kipper said. “See them through.”

The new inmate arrived at about two in the afternoon, and after the other guy’s booked him in he finally came to the cell block at about eight. I put it all behind me and managed to do my job. 

Kevin Watter was a short, overweight, balding guy with raggy stubble and more than a few missing teeth. We took him to his cell, informed him on what would happen and when it would happen, and when the bars slammed home he went and laid on his bed and cried. I won’t tell you what he did, but I will say that I felt sorry for him. 

Just as the sun went down on that day I thought that I was alright to leave. Daryl was sitting on his bed facing away from us and Kevin sat on his bed and looked sick. Greg sat at the desk and filed some paperwork and Hal sat on the monitor typing away at something. 

I heard gagging sounds from the cell and immediately sat straight up. Greg looked up from the paper and walked over. Kevin had vomited all over the cell floor and sat on his bed, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.

“Aw jeez,” he said. Hal walked over to see what was going on for himself.

“You couldn’t keep it in for two more hours?” he muttered. “Then Bill could clean this shit up,” he said under his breath as he walked away. 

“Ay John, you mind getting the mop from the closet while I get him out?” Greg called. My stomach dropped to my boots and I stuttered. 

“Well can you?” Greg asked.

I felt my heart racing and the blood rushing to my head and I just knew that my face was bright red. I stammered out something, not even words before finally Hal said he would do it and went to the closet. He just opened the door, grabbed a mop, and shut it. Greg had Kevin handcuffed and standing outside the cell and Hal went to work cleaning up after him. 

I felt myself calm down, slightly embarrassed at my failure to do such a simple thing. When Hal was finished and Kevin was back in his cell I saw Greg sit across from me.

Greg is an older man, probably sixty, with white hair and a short well groomed beard. 

“What’s on your mind?” he asked me. I looked up, surprised.

“You ain’t been the same since the other night. If we can’t trust you to get a mop, then how-”

“I’m fine,” I interrupted. “I’m fine.”

Finally the next day had arrived. We were supposed to try and execute Daryl again. I already told you all the specifics of how that worked, so I'll skip all that and get to what happened. 

I was nervous the entire time. Greg was in charge of the execution this time, and after he read out the script he pumped the first chemical into Daryl. I winced, and my palms sweat. 

The second chemical is supposed to cause muscle paralysis. So when he pushed the button to inject it we expected him to stop moving. That's not what happened, and instead he started convulsing violently on the gurney, moaning and groaning. 

Immediately Greg pushed the button to close the curtains to the observation room, and while the warden left to deal with that, Greg, Hal, myself, and the prison priest were left to deal with him. He started moaning and groaning as his veins bulged. His head snapped up and looked me dead in the eye. His eyes bugged out, and the thin wisps of hair that stuck out on his head made him look like some sort of insect. 

He shook so violently that the IV needle in his left arm fell out, and I was legitimately worried that the restraints would snap. A pair of doctors rushed in, and I just stood there, in the corner, watching. 

FInally, the cardiogram flatlined and he stopped convulsing and slumped back in his gurney. The medical team threw a white cloth on him and wheeled him out on a stretcher. Hal and Greg just looked at me and left the room, and all I did was stand there for a little while.

An hour later, we found out that he was still alive. 

Barley, but alive, and a few days later they led him straight back into the cell. I asked the warden why they didn’t bring him to the hospital, and he told me that they were already full. 
“We’re just going to kill him anyway,” he said. “No point.”

The good, moral side of me found the disregard for human life repulsing. The other side of me, the side I despised and hated, and repressed every chance I got, agreed. 

But surviving two executions was downright unheard of. I wondered why the state hadn't deemed it “cruel and unusual” yet and called off the execution, but I suppose they just had better things to do. 

I asked the warden what we were going to do next.

“I suppose we’ll just try again. And if that don’t work, then we’ll probably send him somewhere else so they can try.”

I wasn’t convinced. Something about that guy, the way he looked, was wrong. I knew he had something to do with what happened to Carl, who by the way was now just listed as missing, but my mind could not connect the dots. Maybe the dots simply didn’t exist, or maybe they were too far away. A rational person probably would have seen it as a coincidence.

But then again, nobody had seen what I saw. 

And what I saw would never leave me.

That night I was driving home down the road through the desert, with nothing but my headlights and the moon to light the way. A car was pulled over on the side of the road, totalled and covered in a thin film of dust. I pulled over, thinking I might have to give a young couple a ride into town or something. But I knew that something was off. It wasn’t right, I knew it. 

I still had my uniform on, so I grabbed my flashlight and walked down sand to the car. I could tell it had been there for awhile since the windshield was crusted over with sand and cracked. I felt the door handle and a chill went down my spine. 

FInally, I ripped open the door, and saw a man in a Harrison state prison uniform in the front seat. It was Greg, and he was dead. He looked just like Carl, his body shriveled and yellow, his eyes hollowed in and sunken and his jawbone exposed and opened far wider than it should have been. 

I slammed the door and turned around, doubting what I had just seen until I realized it was real. Far too real to deny. I opened the door to look again.

He was gone. Just like Carl. Just… gone. 

Back in my car I drove well over the speed limit toward the prison convincing myself that I was crazy, delusional even. I thought maybe I was in the early stages of schizophrenia or something. Remember how earlier I said I wouldn't convince myself that it was a dream or a hallucination?

Well not I couldn’t. No matter how hard I tried. 

I screeched into the prison parking lot and jumped out of my car before it even rolled to a complete stop. I charged into the cell block, which was empty and dark. I went past the night guards office, and into the corridor, and in front of Daryl’s cell. 

“It’s you.” I said.

He didn’t look up at me.

“Look at me. It’s you, ain’t it?”

He was sitting facing away from me. I slammed my nightstick on the bars and he slowly turned to face me. His skin was sort of yellowish. I shined my flashlight, the only significant source of light in the cell block directly into his eyes and he recoiled, almost like it hurt him. Like he was afraid of it.

“Answer me!” I yelled. “What did you do to them!”

He said nothing. 

“Why wont you die!” I yelled somehow even louder. 

He gave me a dead stare, his eyes never leaving mine as I slid down the bars until I was sitting on the floor I closed my eyes and when I looked up, the inmate had stood up, He towered over me and his shadow covered me. I had compassion for humans, really I did. I grew up in church, I believed in God, but this man had something evil inside of him. Something that knew no good, and that’s what I think I was talking to, looking back at it. 

“Why won’t you die?” I whimpered, this time in a much lighter tone.

“What did you do to them?”

He stayed still, not taking his eyes off of me. 

Then, my vision blurred, and everything went black.
