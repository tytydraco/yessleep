Hello, everyone.

I'm not going to lie; I never thought I'd be writing here, but seeing as how popular Ella's posts have become, well-I don't feel as though I have a choice. My name is Diezel, for anyone who doesn't know me, and I'm the man she has been writing about, her so-called "stalker" or "captor".

Let me be clear about one thing: Ella was never kidnapped. The story she's concocting isn't even a lie-it's sinister. And since her version of events has taken on a life of its own, I have to correct the record.

We matched on a dating app a few months ago and went out a couple of times. At first, everything seemed fine. Normal. The chemistry wasn't fully there but these things happen and I planned on letting communication naturally fizzle out. But things shifted quickly. After what I thought was a mutual decision to stop seeing each other, Ella started showing up in places where she had no reason to be. It really gave me the creeps. Why was she at my mate's house when I happened to drop by and deliver a pizza? I never introduced them and he lives far away from her parent's house. Why was she at a cafe by my house in the wee hours of the morning?.... Her hometown has several more convenient options. Look, call it toxic masculinity but a kind of hot looking chick stalking a straight man like me around was almost flattering and erotic, so I didn't really think intervention was needed, *at first.* I also did hear rumors about this girl legitimately being diagnosed with PTSD from an abusive past so I considered that to be all the more reason for patience. 

First, I told myself it was a coincidence. We are in the same state; it should happen, right? But when this happened again and again, I couldn't just overlook it. Later, she started lurking on my college campus after dark near my dorm or at the best restaurants, where I do my studying and which she knows from my social media.  

I tried to brush this off, but then the escalation happened. One night, I did find a note on my car's windshield that said, "You can't run forever, D"-very cryptic, very scary, and honestly terrorizing. Run from what? This chick thinks my personal religious affiliation is some kind of cult, which is very psychotic, it's all on the up and up. It is a very old and highly organized group, just like the millions of other organized spiritual communities on this earth. Regardless, it was none of her business, no idea how she even found out about my religion because it's not like I tried to convert about her and it's not something I post about but it seems to have fanned the flames of her psychotic symptoms and delusions. Sad. Funny. But sad. 

It came to a head at a coffee shop. I thought it was some sort of random sighting, one of those bizarre coincidences that I try to brush off. But then Ella got up to use the restroom, and her phone buzzed with a notification from Reddit. My curiosity-and concern-got the better of me, and I leaned over to glance at the screen. That's when I saw it: her posts about me. Nuts !!!!! 

Imagine my surprise when I read that I had "captured" her. The whole story was like a scene from some bad thriller movie. To say I was stunned is to say the least. I am also scared. But I am not sure what to do. I can't get law enforcement involved for personal reasons. 

 Her posts aren’t just exaggerations; they’re outright fabrications. Ella has crafted a story where I’m the villain, the monster in her life. Meanwhile, she’s the one leaving creepy notes on my car and lingering around my campus. I have no idea what will happen next, to me, to my loved ones. But I do not really want to find out. 

I don't know if it's an elaborate ploy to manipulate people or she actually believes her own delusions. Whichever it is, it is deeply unnerving. It's not just my reputation that's hanging in the balance; this feels dangerous. She is reminding me of Jodi Arias. 

To all the people who have been following her posts, I apologize if you all have been misled. I would also like to ask: has anyone out there ever encountered a person like this? How do I handle this without escalating the situation further?

***Ella, if you're reading this, I'm asking you to stop. Please. This isn't healthy for either of us, and it needs to end.***
