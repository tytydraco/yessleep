“Lot of fucking help *you* guys were”

That was what I mumbled as I stepped out of the police station after spending the last three and a half hours being questioned and interviewed. The downpour had thankfully abated somewhat, though I was still forced to begin walking the ten or twelve blocks back to where my car was parked by the beach in drizzling rain. Ray and the police chief had been the ones to interview me, and while they believed I’d seen *something* down in that flood and drainage pipe, I could tell they didn’t believe what I told them. *More than likely, they’re just chocking that up to some kind of mental break over seeing the body*. The thought was disheartening; I’d worked with the police on so many cases before, and no matter how ridiculous a scene I’d described to them, they’d always believed me. Now, I felt like I was an outsider to them, with the looks I’d seen them give me.

As I rounded the final corner, my car coming in view, I saw a flurry of movement near it. Someone who’d been standing by the front of it was dashing down the road away from me. “Hey!” I shouted, beginning to run after them. But, after less than five seconds of my attempt, I gave up as I saw, whoever it was round the corner and disappear behind a building. There was no way I was catching up to them. Catching my breath for a moment, I began striding to my car, hoping I wouldn’t find another broken windshield or something. The amount of vandalism I got for the reporting I did was beyond ridiculous, another reason I chose to stay with my thirty year old car instead of buying a new one. 

As I drew close, however, I saw a sheet of paper tucked underneath the passenger windshield wiper, fluttering in the breeze. I reached across the windshield and pulled the paper out and unfolded it. Someone who clearly did not have the best handwriting in the world had written me a note. *I’ve seen it as well. Meet me down by the fishing docks tonight at eight-thirty, and I’ll tell you what I know.* There was no signature. I looked around, then folded the note back up and slipped it into my pants pocket, debating what to do. But, after an extremely short deliberation, I decided I would go tonight and find out what I could. The police had given me my pistol back when I left, which meant I wouldn’t be showing up unarmed and vulnerable. I did, however, reach into my car and pull out my cell phone, dialing Kevin and explaining the situation. Even if my editor was hungrier for a story than the personal safety of his employees, it’d pay to let someone know where I was going. 

Surprisingly, though, he gave me a bit of a warning. “Just be careful down there tonight, Nate” his voice reverberated through the speaker, “You had one close call today, let it be enough for now” I didn’t know how to respond to the abrupt change in his demeanor, and so simply told him I would be and hung up. *When even Kevin’s telling me to be careful, I know this is an extremely bad situation*, I thought. Extremely bad, but also something that, as much as the sensible part of my mind was telling me to let go, I knew would make one hell of a story, even more so than when I’d started the day.

Before I got in my car to go home and change for tonight, I walked to the railing which ran alongside the sidewalk. It was right on the edge of the cliff, and looking straight down, I could see over half a dozen police officers still milling around by the mouth of the pipe. The body of the woman had already been pulled out hours ago, something I’d heard the chief whisper to Ray in the interview room, but I could tell they were still scouring the inside. I could hear their voices echoing up to me from the storm drains behind me. For a moment, the memory of crouching in that pipe and staring at the horror charging at me returned, and its waterlogged laugh echoed in my brain, causing me to shiver. Shaking it away, I quickly walked back to my car and climbed in. I only had a few hours before the meeting time arrived. “Time to make the most of it and prepare before then”

At exactly seven forty-five in the evening, and with the last rays of the sun disappearing over the Pacific, I climbed into my car, carrying a small duffel bag containing a few items I brought along, just in case, and began my drive down to the docks. The streets seemed eerily empty, though I did occasionally pass another car or truck. The fog bank which I’d heard the lighthouse warn of earlier had finally arrived, and I drove slowly through the enveloping white haze which made the streets and buildings seem to shimmer. It felt almost like I was driving through a dream. *Or in this case, a nightmare*. I shook my head. I couldn’t let my mind get the best of me now. I needed to stay sharp. 

With fifteen minutes before the meeting time, I pulled into the parking lot for the fishing docks. The only other sign of life was two old, beat up pickup trucks which no doubt belonged to fishermen who were working late into the night on their boats. After double checking my gun was securely strapped in it's holster, I stepped out of the car, slinging the duffel bag over my shoulder and slamming the door shut. The smell of the ocean mixed with the putrid scent of dead fish, and I wrinkled my nose slightly at the odor. *Just soldier through it and find the person while you still can, Nate*. Nodding in agreement with myself, I strode forward, stepping onto the creaking wood of the upper dock area. There were two sections to the fishing dock; a long upper section stretched straight out into the ocean for about three or four hundred feet, where the fishermen set up their stalls and shops to sell their catch, and almost a maze of floating docks underneath it where the boats would tie up.

After about five minutes of walking around the upper section, it became clear that whoever I was here to meet wasn’t up here. “Welp, looks like I’m heading down to the bottom” I mumbled as I crossed to the metal gangway which connected the two sections. It rattled and vibrated slightly as I quickly walked down it, sounding far too loud in the fog and the overwhelming silence, only broken by the sound of the lighthouse’s foghorn in the distance, and a channel marker buoy letting out a soft *gong,* somewhere out in the bay. As I stepped onto the first section of the lower docks, my sense of balance became off slightly as it bobbed and moved with the waves. I let out my breath slightly; as much as I loved living by the ocean, I was far better on land, and most definitely did not have sea legs like the fishermen did. I felt a bit better a moment later, and began to wind through the maze of wooden docks and fishing boats. Every so often, a pole adorned with a dim, yellow light would appear out of the mist, keeping me from having to break out the flashlight. I also saw two of the boats with their cabin lights on, confirming my suspicions about the fishermen. However, I began to feel slightly put out as I checked my watch. The hands told me it was eight twenty-seven. *Where the hell is this person?*, I wondered. The labyrinth of boats and docks seemed to go on forever, but I could tell I was approaching the end of them, as I could see the end of the upper section above me.

As I rounded what had to be one of the final corners, I finally saw someone. What looked like a man, draped slightly in the fog, stood near the end of one dock, in between two boats. I took a deep breath, then slowly walked towards them, purposely letting my feet rap louder than normal on the wood to signal my presence. When I was within ten feet, the figure turned to me. “That’s close enough, sir” came a voice which confirmed it to be a man. I stopped and raised my hands to show I meant no harm. “No problem” I squinted, as if doing so would help me see through the thick white shroud separating us. “Are you the one who left the note on my car earlier?” I asked. “I am” he said, then slowly walked forward until I could see him well. Instantly, I could tell he was homeless; the torn, ragged and dirty clothing gave it away, as did the dirt covered face and stringy white hair. He looked to be in his mid sixties, an unkempt, mangy grey beard covering the lower half of his face. *That would explain how he could possibly know about..whatever I saw down there*.

I patted the duffel bag at my side. “I’m willing to pay for any information you can give me about any of this” I declared, hoping it would sway him to be completely open with me. It seemed it had done the trick; I saw the man’s eyes light up and he smiled, revealing that he did not have many teeth left in his mouth. Then he grew solemn again. “While I’m happy to take the money” he began, waving his hand, “I’m doing this because so many of us have gone. So many of us have been *taken*, and the truth needs to be told” I nodded, feeling myself relax somewhat at his words. The man didn’t seem like he’d be much of a threat to me. He continued. “You saw it today, down in the pipe, didn’t you?” I cocked my head, wondering how he knew about that. The thought was answered a moment later. “I was standing up near your car when I heard the gunshots and saw you fall out of the pipe” His eyes narrowed. “I heard you scream about something being in the pipe” The eyes softened, and he looked away. “And I saw the cops pull Angie’s body from it an hour later”

Instantly, a wave of sympathy for the man welled up inside me. *He knew the woman*. Most of the homeless knew each other well around here. I spoke up. “Well, if you can give me some good information, I’ll make sure to have my editor put this on the front page of the paper” My assurance seemed to make the man feel better, and he nodded. I reached into my jacket pocket and made sure the pocket recorder was on before continuing. “Do you know what it is?” I asked. He shook his head. “I don’t have a clue what it is, but I know where it comes from” he said, his voice low. “Where?” I asked him. In response, he turned and pointed out to the dark ocean behind him. “Many of us, myself included, have seen it, walking out of the sea and onto the beach in the middle of the night. It comes in for a while, goes off and does whatever it does, then walks back into the waves before dawn”

I felt a small pang of confusion whip over me. “But wait, if you say it returns to the ocean before daybreak, why did I come across it during the middle of the afternoon?” I asked. In response, he gave me an apprehensive look, as if my words had been what had made the realization sink it. “It’s getting bolder, then” he said simply. I felt a small chill ripple through me, though I told myself it was from the cold wind coming from off the water. I needed to keep the man talking. “Why haven’t you gone to the police, though?” I asked him, “If you are being taken by this thing, why not tell them what’s happening?” He gave me a look of disgust. “Do you think we *haven’t* tried telling them? We have, many times; even I have before. They just write our warnings off as the product of drugs, or booze, or just plain craziness” He looked down at the ratty sneakers on his feet, then spoke softly. “When it began taking us, first one at a time, then two or three, we tried telling anyone we thought we could. But we were just ignored” Another well of sympathy rushed through me for him. I began to ask my next question when a strong wave or piece of flotsam hit the bottom of the dock we both stood on, causing us both to sway slightly off balance.

After regaining it, I continued. “When did this start?” He shrugged. “Around the end of December, beginning of January, I think” The dock shuddered under our feet again, and I decided to end the interview fast. The last thing I wanted to do was get knocked off into the water. But before I could ask my last question, he spoke up again. “Johnny told me once that he’s seen it go into the caves a lot down the coast” he said. I kept silent for a moment, trying to piece together where he meant in my mind. *There’s a lot of small caves along the coastline, but where could he- oh! Of course, the sea lion caves!* Just down the coast from town was a bit of a tourist attraction, a mess of caves connected to the ocean which were often occupied by a large colony of sea lions. That *had* to be what the man was talking about. I nodded, unzipping the bag and pulling out a small stack of twenty dollar bills. In total, about three hundred dollars. I held it out to the man, who, after a nervous moment, reached out and took it, nodded gratefully at me, then backed away again. 

“Before I go, I need to ask you one last question” I said. He nodded again. I took a deep breath, unsure of whether I wanted an answer to my final question. But no, I needed it, both for the story. And my own insatiable curiosity. “Do you know what it looks like?” I asked. Instantly, I knew that he *did*. The look of sheer horror which became plastered on his now pale face instinctively made me shudder. It was as if I’d asked a hospital patient who’d been brought back to life and had seen hell what it looked like. He opened his mouth a time or two, his voice seeming to catch in his throat. Then he held up a hand, silently asking me to give him a second. I nodded.

As he opened his mouth to finally answer, the biggest bump to the bottom of the dock came. I almost went sprawling onto the dock, or worse, into the dark water; my saving grace came in the form of one of the light poles, which I grabbed onto to stay on my feet. As I pulled myself completely upright, my ears were assaulted by a piercing scream. From the direction it came, I could tell it was the man, and I worried for a moment he’d hurt himself. I turned back, ready to help him to his feet, even take him to the hospital, if needed.

And I froze. I could feel the blood draining from my face and my jaw drop open. I wanted to scream out, but it felt as if it had been trapped in my esophagus. The man had fallen down; lying sprawled across the wet wood. But that wasn’t what had shocked me into inaction. It was what was gripped tightly around one of his legs. A claw. A very familiar, black skinned claw, which ended in inwardly pointing talons. Talons which now pierced deep into the man’s calf muscle; what had caused him to scream. Dark red blood dripped from the punctures, pooling onto the wood in a small puddle. I looked down and saw that the hand disappeared into the dark water, and felt another wave of horror course through me at the realization. *It wasn’t waves or junk we felt hit the underside of the docks. It was that THING! It’s been under us the whole damn time!* I saw the man gripping desperately onto the opposite edge of the dock, and I realized that it was attempting to pull him into the ocean, where only God knew what it would do to him. 

I dropped my bag and exploded into motion, dashing to the man’s side. He kept one hand in a death grip around the wood, but reached out with the other and took my outstretched hand. “It’s okay; I’ve got you, I’ve got you!” I yelled at him. He let out another scream, and I saw the claw had sunk its talons deeper into his leg. His eyes stared up at me, filled with a mixture of sheer terror and desperation. “Don’t let go, for the love of God, don’t let go of me!” he screamed out in my face. I tightened my grip on his hand and wrist, determined to do what I could to keep him here.

What happened next, happened in a fraction of a second. I saw the muscles in the claw tense up, and the next, the man was wrenched out of my grasp. I heard the bones in his hand gripping the dock break with a sickening sound, and caught a glimpse of his terrified face as he began to let out another scream. And then it was abruptly cut off as he was yanked beneath the waves with a huge splash. A rapid stream of bubbles rose to the surface for a moment, then stopped. I sprang to my feet, rapidly backing away from the red streak of blood which marked the last spot the man had been. “Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck me, man” I gasped out as I reached down and snatched up my bag. *Bang!* I was nearly sent off my feet as the dock was violently slammed into from below. *Shit!* It was trying to knock me into the ocean now! I saw that claw reach up and grab the edge of the dock, two of its talons adorned with ribbons of flesh from its last victim.

I didn’t think anymore; not about the gun on my waist or anything. I just turned and booked it. I dashed down the stretch of dock to the next connecting section. *Get me off of this fucking maze!* I screamed internally as I kept rounding corner after corner. I hoped one of the fishermen aboard their boats would have heard the commotion and come out to check. But nobody’s face appeared. *Bang!* I flew off my feet, the world falling away beneath me as it was rammed from below. For one terrifying moment, I was sure I was going to plunge headfirst into the water. I knew if I did, I would never see the surface again. Instead, I slammed face first into the hard wood of the dock. Instantly, I felt the warm well of blood begin flowing freely from my nose, which had slammed into the dock first. I tried pulling myself to my feet, then screamed as the claw practically leapt out of the water, its talons poised to snatch me. I rolled out of the way seconds before it would have grabbed my leg, then struggled to my feet.

*Bang!* I began to run again, almost losing my balance again. I looked behind me, still seeing the claw gripping the edge of the dock. It didn’t appear as though it were pursuing me. For a second, I gave a silent prayer of thanks. *Bang!* I lost my footing again, this time crashing into one of the light poles, sending a zap of pain into my shoulder where it collided with it. For a moment, confusion overtook me. *What the hell was THAT?! It’s still back there!*

That’s when a sight appeared which made the horror I’d already experienced pale in comparison. A claw appeared, trying to snatch my foot in its grasp, and I leapt back from the pole. As I did, I noticed that *this* claw was missing the talon on its middle finger. Not to mention it was slightly lighter in color than the other. “Oh, fuck” I moaned out. *There’s more than one of these things?!* The horrifying realization made me turn and began running faster than I ever had in my life. I likely would have given Usain Bolt a run for his money as I ran through the hellish labyrinth of docks and boats. Every time I would make my way onto a new section, I would feel it get rammed from below. *There’s a fucking group of them!* Adrenaline coursed through my body for the second time that day, and I ran faster, somehow able to stay on my feet. I couldn’t help but let out a scream of my own, one which matched the poor man’s in terror as I kept seeing claw after claw try grabbing me from the black water.

And then I rounded the corner, almost breaking into sobs as I saw my savior which was the metal gangway ahead of me. I dashed onto it, sprinting up towards the upper section of the pier. It seemed to take forever, but finally, I reached it, slamming into the wooden railing opposite the gangway so hard that, for a moment, I feared I’d break right through the aging structure. I stood there for what had to be only ten or twenty seconds, but felt like forever, clutching the railing in a death grip and gasping for air from my burning lungs. Finally, I stood up, still breathing heavily, but feeling okay enough to stand on my own. I turned and looked back down the gangway. For a moment, I was afraid that I would see a dark figure at the bottom of it, or worse, a group of them, staring up at me with red, glowing eyes and laughing before rushing me. But nothing was there. The dock had fallen eerily and completely silent. The only two sounds I could hear were the foghorn, and the soft *gong* of the channel marker buoy somewhere out in the fog.

*They hadn’t followed me,* I thought. *But, why? They could easily have gotten me here*. I didn’t know the answer, and I knew I wouldn’t find out anytime soon. If ever. A thought crossed my mind quickly, and I jammed my hands into my pocket. “Shit!” I spat out into the dark. My recorder had fallen out of my pocket in the race to get off the hell below me; it likely had slid off into the water. Even if it hadn’t, there was no way in *hell* I was going back down there to check. Even though the area was silent, I was overcome with the feeling of being watched, by many different pairs of eyes. They were still down there, below the waves, looking up at me.

Instead, I turned and began to jog back towards the parking lot. Reaching my car, I unlocked the door and dropped inside, slamming it shut and making sure it was locked before anything. I leaned over and unzipped the duffle bag now lying on the passenger seat, at the same time pulling a packet of tissues out from the ashtray in the center console. I found what I was looking for, dropping the cell phone into my lap before using some of the tissues to stop up my still bleeding nose. Then I flipped the phone open, finding the number I’d been looking for and dialing it. After a few moments, I heard the line pick up, a groggy and irritated voice greeting me?

“Nate, you better have a good reason for waking me up when I need to be awake by four tomorrow” Ray’s voice grumbled. “Ray, you need to get out of bed and meet me at the twenty-four hour diner in town right now” I said urgently, the tissues in my nose giving me a voice which almost resembled Squidward’s from the SpongeBob children’s cartoon. I didn’t give him a chance to retort. “Meet me there in fifteen minutes, it’s an emergency!” And with that, I flipped the phone closed, dropping it back into the bag. I pulled my car keys from the bag, jamming them into the ignition and starting the motor.

As I backed out and began to drive away to my meeting with Ray, I cast one final look down at the black water.

For a moment, I swore I could see the exact red glow of eyes I’d imagined, watching me from just beneath the surface.
