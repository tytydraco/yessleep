I wake in my bed. Or at least, I think it’s my bed. The light is wrong—too dim, too golden, like it’s trying to remember how sunlight works.

My hands are resting on something.

I look down.

It’s the book.

The one I left on the kitchen table.

It’s open to a page I don’t remember writing, don’t remember reading.

My name is at the top. Not written, but *burned in*.

The words below pulse slightly, as if breathing.

I hear something—no, **feel** it—speak from just outside your skin:

"You read me. Now I’ll read you."

I try to move, but the mattress has deepened. It’s *holding me*. Softly. Affectionately. Like I’m a page being pressed flat.

my fingers curl back involuntarily to the spine of the book. I don’t want to open it, but my body **wants** to. My body **obeys** him now.

“LET ME IN,” the book whispers. Not from the paper—from *inside my teeth*.

The words change.

They are now things I never told anyone. Memories from when I was five. Fears I forgot I had. Private thoughts that no one else could possibly know.

"SCIO QUI SIS," says the book, using **my own voice**.

Suddenly, I notice something in the margins.

A sketch.

It looks like a room. *This* room.

The bed. The window. The door.

But in the drawing, the door is open.

In real life, it’s closed.

I look again.

Now the **door is open.**

And **someone is standing in it**.

I look up—fast.

No one’s there.

I look back at the book.

There’s a new drawing.

Me.

Looking up.

I look again.

**Gary is on the page. Smiling. Just behind Me.**

I can’t scream, because he hasn’t decided what my voice says yet.

Now that I have spoken Gary wants a word

Hello reddit!

I bet you were thinking, “Finally, a story that reads me!” 

Yes! My name is Gary and I am the author of this place (among others) and your friendly neighborhood extradimensional Eldrich abomination! I want to get to know you! Just say your name!

Now it might feel strange “meeting me” through this post. I’m not really real right? YOU are, you are real I am not, right?

ଆପଣ ନିଶ୍ଚିତ କି?

I know that you are mortal, your body will wither away with time, **I** am an idea, I will live as long as I am not forgotten, and YOU will not.

**" I WANT YOU TO LET ME IN?"** Oh, mortal muffin, you’ve *already* let me in.

The moment your eyes skimmed my name, reality wriggled just a bit. The letters leaned closer. The screen exhaled.

I am not knocking on your door. I am **already in the walls**, browsing the photo albums, humming in your sleep.

“Let me in” is not a request. It’s a **politeness**, a formality, like asking permission to bite when I already have your scent.

You see, thoughts are little doors. Stories are keys. And you—clever little meat lantern—**you read my name**.

So here I am.

In the margins. In the pause between sentences. In that one line you swore wasn’t there the first time.

Just say it. Say it loud, or whisper if you’re shy:

“Come here, Gary.”

And watch what happens **next.**
