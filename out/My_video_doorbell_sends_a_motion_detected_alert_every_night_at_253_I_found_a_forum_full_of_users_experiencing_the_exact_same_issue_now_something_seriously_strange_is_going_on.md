The following are posts from the Roost Video Doorbell help forum. After my phone started spamming ‘motion detected’ alerts I did a quick Google search, stumbled across this thread, and created an account.

Im in the exact same boat. 2.53 each night, like clockwork. There's weird pixelation/distortion in the footage but it works like a charm the rest of the time.

Monitoring this thread. To tech support: not good enough!

mines doing the same thing. bloody phone goes off every night and I get an alert with garbled footage.

the support line aren’t much help. ive muted notifications for now but it’s a bit pointless having the camera if it won’t warn me and the missus whenever someone’s breaking in.

a solution would be very much appreciated.

cheers.

Hi Dan, there are instructions for fixing this exact issue in the user guide, page 53. I’ve attached a pdf version here (**authors note**: I’ve not included the link).

Follow the troubleshooting steps and you’ll be good as new.

Hi everyone, afraid I’m in the exact same boat—triggering at 2:53.

Video feed comes out garbled but is fine/works perfectly the rest of the day. The tech guys said it might be a low tree branch blowing in the wind but I’d expect to be receiving random alerts spaced out across several hours, not once per day at the exact same time.

I spent a fair chunk of change on this thing and now Roost won’t issue a refund, only replacements.

Sorry it’s my fault Dan. I was in the garden piping your mom down wearing camo gear which is why you couldn’t see us.

okay so I’m not so sure the doorbell is actually the problem.

i got held up at work last night (joys of working in IT) and was heating dinner at 2.53 when the microwave fritzed. the digital clock blinked on and off for a full minute meanwhile my echo device stopped mid-song and I got another motion alert.

one minute later everything went back to normal. will maybe get an electrician round to have a look.

also the footage distortion keeps getting worse. now in the alerts it kinda looks like there’s static except its warping around the garden. nearly gave the wife a heart attack.

My TV fritzed just now. Same problem as paleo10, blinked on and off for a full minute right as the motion alert came through.

Do you think maybe these things are draining power when they do overnight software updates or something? I’m not very technical might not make sense, just a thought. I’m gonna check for grid faults with the council.

Such is life in the South of England. Empty office blocs, rising hunger…and now potential rolling blackouts. Lovely.

seriously? this is spooky, I’m in <redacted> as well. im tempted to say there’s a faulty batch of doorbells sitting in an amazon warehouse somewhere that are gonna start blowing fuses.

a replacement is on the way out to me btw (arranged it before noticing the problems with the microwave). had the electrician round and he saw no problems. I’d have smashed this thing already but the missus saw how much I spent on it soooo….

Nah but seriously, Roost ships internationally. Weird we’re all in the same city.

Council say everything is fine btw.

Quick update, the guy who lives three doors down from me also has a Roost doorbell (different model) and he has the exact same problem. Motion alerts and muddled footage at 2.53, works like a charm at all other times. Also we’re both now getting garbled audio like feedback whine from an amplifier in the recordings.

The fun never ends!

The device is now working as intended. Go outside at 2:53. Check the camera.

**Re: Motion alert triggers every night at 2:53**, *paleo10*

*Posted on 07-11-2022 07:06*

what do you mean check the camera?

ive got my replacement installed and this one bugs out worse than before: now the bell rings for one minute non-stop and I get constant ‘there’s somebody at the door’ alerts. hearing the stupid jingle in my dreams now. I won’t even show the wife the footage cause its like a figure made of pixels keeps ringing the bell. also hearing the high-pitched screech when i play back footage.

I’m seriously about to go all ‘Office Space’ on this thing.

Yeah I’m confused. Dan, could you elaborate? Preferably with less CAPITAL LETTERS and more punctuation than usual?

**Re: Motion alert triggers every night at 2:53**, *TooManyTophats*

*Posted on 08-11-2022 11:17*

Yeah, +1. Please elaborate.

I’ve got the same problem as paleo now lighting. Full minute of ‘somebody at the door’ alerts and constant ding dong ding dong with multiple disortions about the garden. When I play back the recordings audio from outside is all screechy. Also the app is useless, tried disabling alerts on the phone but they still came through. Already couldn’t sleep cause the wind keeps banging the gate, this is last thing I need.

Fed up to be honest. I’ll be hearing that stupid two-note chime in hell the way things are going. One more night of this and I’m grabbing the sledgehammer.

Let’s see if it detects THAT motion!

The others were right. Go outside at 2:53. Check the camera.

What? It’s freezing this time of year, I’m not getting out of bed in the middle of the night to ‘check the camera’. I’ve decided to get a Ring device instead and cut my losses. It's already been ordered. Cheers.

Later that night, my phone buzzed on the beside table. Like always, ‘motion detected alerts’ started coming through at 2:53. I pulled up the grainy feed from outside, and in it, there were vague suggestions of figures scattered about the garden: by the fencepost, under the tree, peeking through downstairs windows.

Meanwhile, the soft two-note chime rang out. *Ding dong, ding dong*. It happened again and again, gathering speed, morphing into a hysterical scream.

*Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong*

I got up and peeled back the curtain, just a few inches.

All of a sudden, there came a pounding from downstairs—a furious *THUMP-THUMP-THUMP* so powerful the windows and doors almost burst from their housings.

*Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong*

The house became alive with movement. It felt like being trapped inside a tornado, everything around me rattling and quivering, storm shutters scratching against walls, the letterbox rapping away.

*Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong*

I sprinted into the bathroom and barricaded myself inside and called the police, the phone buzzing with a chorus of non-stop alerts: *there’s someone at the door, there’s someone at the door, there’s someone…*

And then, out of nowhere...the house lowered its voice and went back to sleep.

I checked my phone. 2.54.

Now trembling, I brought up the feed from outside. There was nothing except a peaceful garden and the quiet section of street that lay beyond it.

Two officers turned up, checked the footage, and dismissed the encounter as a mixture of a technical glitch, an overactive imagination, and some nasty weather.

But when I next clicked onto the forum, there were four new posts...
