Bam! Bam! Bam! I open my eyes and look around. I feel the ground moving beneath me. Unease fills my body. I hear screaming, it sounds guttural almost like someone being beaten. I look around to see where this noise could be coming from, I see plain white walls and no doors or windows. I see one other person, an old woman sitting in a chair reading. I look at her and call out in an urgent tone.

 “Do you know where that screaming is from?!” 

She looks at me and smiles, the voice that comes out of her mouth is otherworldly. It’s warped and deep, it makes my whole body tense with fear.

 “You must be Phoebe, oh, that’s from Hell.” 

I’m horrified, she must be able to see it on my face. 

“Am I in hell?!” I sound distressed.

“Worse Phoebe, you lucky duck, are in the in-between. You see, when you passed on to this next life, Heaven and Hell were full. Can you believe it?! Only has happened one other time, anyway. Once a spot opens up in either you’ll go there.” She says this so joyfully with her warped voice, I want to scream.

I stand in shock. How could I ever respond to that, I’m stuck in the in-between. 

“How does a spot open up?” I whisper out under my breath. 

“Once a demon gets tired of torturing, or when a person gets sick of Heaven. It will happen sooner or later. It doesn’t matter what you do in life. That’s what makes it so fun in the in-between, you could be a serial killer or a saint. It doesn’t matter because your dead soul needs a forever space.” She goes back to reading her book. 

My face drops with all emotion, I’m stuck until someone else decides my fate without realizing it. I thought I was a good person. I mean what person believes they’re a bad person? Whatever the change I did on earth doesn’t matter anymore. I sit on the cold 
ground, and the screams from below shake the floors violently. I sit and stare at the wall, nothing I did matters.

I want to scream about how unfair this is. Someone should check my record, someone should look! However, I can’t speak from the shock I’m feeling. I also worry about how if they did look over my record It could be the same outcome. I wasn’t Mother Theresa, but I also wasn’t a criminal. I don’t want to go somewhere with all bad people. A tear drops from my eye as I realize my whole life was a lie.

From a young age, I went to church every Sunday, went to bible study, and was the head camp counselor for VBS in the summer. I taught my children about God. I would brush their hair and pick out nice clothes for them. I married a freaking pastor. All did was talk about how God has a plan, I stayed home and read the Bible every single day. For what? I’m still sitting here. My fate is decided if someone gets bored. 

I look over at the old woman, my head resting on my wrist, “What are you then? A demon?”

“A demon?! No, I’m God.” She laughs.

“You’re not God, I know God.” I whisper out, the sound of my heart breaking must be heard by the woman.

It lets out a guttural laugh that makes me want to lie in a ball and sob with dread. 

“Oh, my Phoebe, you don’t know me. No one knows me. Just humans who think they do so they can get some sense of pride. They say they know and love me to feel better, not because they do! You don’t know me, I know you!”

I start crying at the terrifying screaming coming from this old woman. The constant screaming in that voice. That voice, it makes me want to bash my head on the wall. It’s not human or calming, it's almost a low growl. After a couple of minutes of angry staring, she breaks eye contact and looks down. She begins to speak to me again. 

 “So, I know you must be thinking how unfair this is. Well, let me tell you Pheeb, the afterlife is just as unfair as the real world. Life will never be fair before, during, or after.” Her creepy voice sends shivers down my spine.

I can’t respond, I feel betrayed. I feel betrayed by life. I grew up with religion being shoved down my throat, like a child who won't eat their broccoli at dinner. I know it's no one’s fault that this is my fate, but I feel like it's my fault. I had my doubts, maybe if I had believed more or been nicer to my parents I would’ve gotten first place in Heaven. 

“Where do they go?” I stare at the old woman.

“Where do who go?”

“The people, who get bored of heaven or are sent out of hell. Where do their souls go?”

“Oh, they go out to the universe, become tiny spread apart atoms.”

At this moment, I would rather do that than sit in this room with a false God. I know it's not a false God, but looking at her I refuse that’s with this thing is. I don’t care what it said earlier, I know God. 

You know when you’re growing up and realizing your parents aren’t superheroes? Realizing they're not perfect and can be mean and hurtful. Growing farther and farther apart from them, until you only see them on holidays and just stare wondering what happened. That’s how I feel, I am realizing the one single thing I truly full-heartedly believed in, isn’t what I expected. 

“How long will I be here?” My voice is back to whisper, too many thoughts to speak louder.

“A couple hours, a day tops. Why? You happy to get rid of me?” Its cackle makes me wanna barf, it's not human but it's so close.

“Yes.” I close my eyes.

I don’t want to look anymore. I can’t look anymore. It makes my stomach fill with fear like an elephant is sitting on my chest. I wish I didn’t ask how long I'll be stuck with this thing. Every time a minute passes more and more dread fills my stomach not knowing what the rest of eternity will hold. Every tiny sound I hear makes me want to scream. Knowing the next one could be the last sound I ever hear other than screams. 
Beep. Beep. I hear an alarm go off finally. I open my eyes and see the terrifying thing staring at me. 

“Okay pheeb, you ready?”

“No! Are you crazy?!” I scream at it. It’s a violent sounding scream I’ve never heard come out of my mouth. 

A door appears, it's all gold with a black door handle. 

“Classy.” I say under my breath.

As I walk to the door, the creature stares at me and smiles as Im about to open the door she begins to speak.

“Bye, Pheeb.” The thing waves.

“Don’t call me that.” I yell back.

I take a deep breath, even though I can’t breathe anymore I go through the motions. My hand falls on the door handle, I take my last look at the room. I step through for the first time in my life not praying when I walk into a room.
