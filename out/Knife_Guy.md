Some of you may have heard the joke about ‘knife guy’, in 2sentence2horror, and I’m not entirely sure it’s a joke anymore. So before you think I’m joking I’m not, something has been going on lately, and it’s freaking me out.  
  
I found the joke funny the first few times, but it got a little repetitive, so eventually I just started ignoring it, but it still somehow found me.  
  
I was talking with my friends about staying up late, and then my buddy Mark said,” Sometimes it’s like knife guy is really in the room with me.”  
  
Then of course he imitated the scream emoji, and everyone laughed, including myself. I didn’t know Mark used reddit, so I asked him what subs he liked, and he stared at me looking confused.  
  
“How do you know about knife guy if you don’t use reddit?” I asked him.  
  
“Bro, what do you mean, don’t you remember the group chat? You were the one who came up with the joke!” Mark replied still laughing.  
  
I was annoyed now, so I said,” I swear on God I don’t remember that.”  
  
He left it after that, but said he might have ‘proof’ lying around somewhere.  
  
After that I spent the rest of the day at home, trying to make some reason out of it. Eventually I got tired and just went to bed, and pulled up reddit.  
  
When I opened it, the entire homepage was filled with empty posts from all of my subreddits, simply titled ‘near’. No upvotes, comments, nothing, and when I went on to the subreddits themselves I couldn’t find a single one. About then was when I started to think something was wrong.  
  
The next day I asked about the posts on different subs, but every single time I posted, it was removed, with the reason being ‘secret’, and I was genuinely started to freak out, so I decided to put my phone away for the rest of the day, something I probably should be doing anyways, and went to see my friends to see if it had been a dream or a joke or just something.  
  
I met them at the McDonald’s nearby, and immediately when I entered, Mark came up to me and held out his hand. In it, he was holding a picture of me, doing the scream face, from around 10th grade.  
  
“Nice Photoshop,” I said, still not believing him.  
  
But everyone said they remembered it, even Josh who had a notoriously bad memory. I was beginning to panic, but I decided it was probably just a joke, and that it would stop after a while. I was wrong.  
  
I decided to stay for a while, to see if they’d slip up, but I really wish I hadn’t, because after just a few minutes, every other joke became about ‘knife guy’. Eventually, I told them it wasn’t funny anymore, but it's like they didn't hear me, they just kept laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing. I needed to get away, so I stood up quickly and shot out of there, not stopping until the door was shut behind me.  
  
I had a new plan, if I didn’t meet anyone, I would never hear those two stupid words again. So I went to the store, bought supplies for a few months, and locked myself inside, but I couldn’t bring myself to destroy my phone, and the next day my phone kept buzzing and buzzing, until I checked, and every contact on my phone texted me the word ‘tonight’.  
  
Turning off notifications, I went up to my room, now knowing for certain these events were connected to each other. I kept wondering what the words I had come across, ‘near’, ‘secret’, and ‘tonight’, but couldn’t make any sense of them, so I tried to sleep.  
  
I woke halfway through the night, hearing whispering, and it only took a few seconds for me to panic and try to leave, where to leave, where to leave. I did not know.  
  
The whispering continues, not from any specific direction, but I stopped in my tracks when I heard a voice speak,” Ah finally, you’re alone.”  
  
I locked myself in my closet and hurriedly grabbed my phone, first I called 911, but there was no response. Every single one of my friends thought I was messing with them, and I decided to calm myself down, and look through some memes, and I did, except they weren’t memes, every single picture I found saved on my phone had every single person it in doing the scream emoji.  
  
I’m deciding to post this now, because the whispering only gets louder, and the day hasn’t come yet, though the clock on my phone says 11:57 am, I looked outside and the window was all black, no light, not even from the streets.  
  
The strangest thing though, is there are contacts showing up in my phone I don’t remember, some guy named Josh keeps texting me saying he is sorry, but the number wont show, so I don’t know if it is my friend. Also new numbers keep popping up, for the last hour, saying only one final word: ‘hide’.
