Feces. Feces and filth. And animal abuse. And laughing children. But mostly feces. 

‘Fun for the whole family.’ 

Other families, maybe. All I can focus on is my skin absorbing the feculent air. 

The zoo isn't my kind of place. No place is, to be fair, but a vast expanse of grimy enclosures ridden with despondent wildlife and screaming kids would never be somewhere I'd attend willingly. 

Dad says I used to love it here when I was a kid. He thinks stimulating positive mental activity might help me. 

Really? I thought reminiscence therapy was for dementia patients. Pretty sure that's not what I have. 

But I certainly am too old for this. I can feel the other adults staring at me. They glance around, wondering which little one is mine. And then they realize that I didn't come with any children. I'm the child. An embarrassing overgrown encumbrance suckled by an exhausted father.

I want to tell them it wasn't my idea coming here and I'm only doing this for Dad, but I know they won't believe me. I can't even meet their eyes. 

Aren't there supposed to be animals here to look at? It’s their pathetic countenances that should be scrutinized, not mine. 

I extract my gaze from the dirt, searching for a captive fellow to divert this insufferable attention. The enclosures are so sparsely populated. Seriously, what a waste of money. 

And then finally, I see it. A zebra. We must be in the safari section. 

It stands alone in the smallest patch of tall grass imaginable, one of the zoo's pitiful attempts at grassland reenactment, I assume. The zebra's lower half is obscured, but from what I can see, there's something terribly wrong with this animal. 

Its skin is so loose. It folds and drapes off its body in places, hanging down into the grass. And its head is too big. Its drifting eyes look uneven; their gaze independent of one another. It shuffles awkwardly with stiff, clumsy movements. 

It honestly looks like two people in a costume, but like the worst, most low-budget costume ever. It's uncanny to a laughable degree. 

Is this a prank? Who is this for? I'd think most kids would find this thing frightening more than anything. Admittedly, even I'm somewhat unnerved. 

Thing is, nobody else seems to care; no one's even acknowledged it. 

I call Dad over. 

“What a weird joke, huh? You think they're rando’s that just snuck in?” 

Dad stares blankly. 

“The zebra?” 

“Yeah, the zebra. It's clearly two guys in a suit. What's up with this place?” 

Dad emits the driest of laughs, the kind that one makes when not a single word heard is absorbed. He never listens to me. He pretends to, but given our current location, there's an obvious disconnect between my words and their meaning. Even though I've grown accustomed to expect it, it still hurts each time. 

Forget him. He'll notice the zebra people eventually. Probably once everyone else does, or at least someone whose opinion matters to him. 

I storm off, putting as much distance between us as possible. But upon entering the lion exhibit, I stop. 

There's another one. 

Amongst the lions sits a crude imitation. I can see several hands inside lazily working its jaw and head. 

What is going on? 

Again, I look round to see if anyone else notices. The crowd continues to aimlessly flow and chatter, either hopelessly self-absorbed or perhaps in on the joke. I'm surrounded, yet utterly alone. 

Until my gaze locks with another's. The glimmering eyes of an ape. Chimpanzee, according to the sign. 

He smiles at me. His legs dangle from the tree branch he's sat upon. His pale, smooth, clearly human feet swing back and forth like a child's. 

I need to sit down; I need water. There should be a drinking fountain in the reptile house over there. Doesn't look like there's anyone else inside right now either. That's good; I need a break from all this. 

I sit on a bench in the atrium and catch my breath. Inside the tank across from me lies a python. And inside the python stretches the prominent outline of a man. Painted latex wraps around his naked body, its surface patterned after scales. 

He lugubriously wriggles forward, head repeatedly thumping against glass. A muffled moaning becomes painfully audible as I catch sight of his bloodshot eyes. 

I promptly find the exit. 

Dad is outside, confused at my disquietude. I insist that we leave immediately; practically begging. Albeit disappointed at the brevity of our visit, Dad relents. 

“At least we're making baby steps, buddy. I'm still proud of you.” 

Yeah Dad, whatever. I've been on a journey for sure, right in front of you actually. 

My insufferable invisibility perseveres. My strength however, does not. I'm exhausted. Even under perfectly uneventful circumstances, extended public outings completely drain me, and today was unlike anything I've ever experienced. Simply too much to reflect upon. 

I lock my door and collapse into bed. The sun's far from setting, but my bedroom’s impervious to all manner of light. One of the perks of our parsimoniously windowed home. 

The comforting escape found in abyssal darkness is one of the few things Dad has neglected to take from me to ‘fix me’. I wish I could remain here forever. 

Thankfully, sleep comes swift and I graciously accept the end to this strange, strange day. But in my dreams, I see the zebra. 

In the dark, it stands before me silently; its absent, misaligned eyes aimlessly drifting. Until they slowly settle on me. There's far more than two people inside that thing. 

As I awake, the soft flesh of the snake man nuzzles against me, moaning into my ear. 

I can't. I can't pretend like nothing happened yesterday. Like I didn't see them. Like I don't still see them in my lucid thoughts. 

I don't care if it's some kind of big zoo conspiracy or just a prank by kids; I need to know why no one else saw what I saw. I need someone else to see. Just one other person, that's all. That's the only closure necessary. 

I've made up my mind. 

I'm going back.
