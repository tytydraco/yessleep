"Okay, we have to say the name on the count of three—you remember, don’t you?" my sister asks as she switches off the lamp by the table.

I roll my eyes dismissively and nod.

We walk together to our adjoined bathroom. She holds a white candle, lighting it with her bright yellow lighter, the flame sending warm orange flickers around the room. Shadows dance on the tiles, the dim glow making the small space feel impossibly vast. She catches my gaze in the mirror, her face taut with an intensity I can’t quite place, and takes a deep breath.

"One," she says, locking eyes with my reflection.

"Two," I whisper, my chest tightening as I inhale.

"Three." Our voices intertwine perfectly. "We come to you, Goddess of the Night, Creature of all Darkness, and ask for you to show yourself."

I close my eyes, half-expecting a surge of icy wind, a loud bang, or even the mirror to crack. But the night remains utterly silent.

"Is that it?" I ask dubiously.

My sister shrugs, her bravado crumbling. "Maybe the Creature of All Darkness doesn’t do house calls," she mutters, snuffing out the candle with a pinch.

We retreat to bed in silence, the thrill replaced by an irritating sense of childishness. The spell book we found in the attic, with its cracked leather cover and ancient pages, promised much more than this.

I fall asleep fast, my body giving in to the exhaustion of the week.

But deep into the night, I wake abruptly. A biting cold breeze licks at my face, seeping under the covers. My room feels unnaturally frigid. Rubbing my eyes, I sit up, irritated.

"Can you turn the AC off? It’s fucking cold as shit," I grumble, my voice hoarse with sleep. There’s no response.

I groan. "Beth. Seriously, I’m freezing."

Still nothing.

Sighing in annoyance, I turn toward her bed, ready to yank the blanket off her as punishment. But I stop mid-motion. Her bed is empty.

I jolt awake, my grogginess evaporating. My heart beats faster as I approach her side of the room. Her yellow lighter lies abandoned on the sheets. And next to it—just barely visible in the moonlight streaming through the window—is a speck of fresh blood.

“Beth?” My voice cracks.

A sudden noise from the bathroom makes me whip around. It’s faint at first, like a distant shuffle. Then, the unmistakable sound of heavy, deliberate breathing.

My skin crawls as I force my feet to move, the wooden floor cold beneath me. The bathroom door creaks open slightly, the gap spilling darkness into the hall.

“Beth?” I whisper again, stepping closer.

From the darkness, a hand emerges—not my sister’s, not even human I think. It’s grayish, unnaturally thin and pale, with claw-like fingers. They tap the edge of the doorframe once, twice, then scrape downward, leaving shallow gouges in the wood.

A voice, deep and guttural, echoes faintly: “You called me.”

I freeze, unable to breathe. The door swings open wider, revealing nothing but shadows inside.

And then, a low laugh.

I take a step back, stumbling into my bed. My pulse pounds in my ears, but a strange calm settles over me. I glance at the lighter on Beth’s bed, a memory tugging at the edges of my mind. 

The spell book wasn’t a hoax after all.

I pick up the lighter and smile to myself, toothily. Now I know for sure—spell book curses work.

The laugh grows louder, reverberating through the walls, and my grip on the lighter tightens. The shadows from the bathroom swirl, stretching across the floor like hungry tendrils. My heart hammers, but the memory sharpens—Beth’s smug face earlier that day, her taunts ringing in my ears.

The spell wasn’t just for summoning. It was for an offering; something Beth in the haste of excitement didn’t notice of course, she always was like that, *smug*.

I glance back at her bed, at the tiny streak of blood. She’d nicked her finger flipping through the pages, a careless moment I’d pretended not to notice but hoped would have happened. Unlike Beth, I found the book earlier and knew one trade secret she didn’t; *Blood seals every promise,* the spell had said.

A shape begins to materialize in the doorway, tall and monstrous. The creature’s voice is smoother now, almost amused. “The deal is done.”

My smile widens as I watch the shadows coil tighter.

Beth wanted to lead, to control. Tonight, she gets what she asked for.

And I get exactly what I wanted.

The laugh deepens, resonating through the walls as if the house itself were joining in and vibrating off it. The creature steps forward, its gray, sinewy form catching the faint moonlight. Shadows ripple across its surface, alive and writhing, as though the darkness itself obeyed its will, I looked in awe completely transfixed by the creature in front of me.

I sit down on my bed, watching the scene unfold with a detachment and a calmness that never came to me before. My fingers toy with the lighter, the tiny spark of flame dancing at my whim. It’s poetic, really. Beth always thought she was the smart one, the leader. Always had to have the upper hand but how the tables have turned on her.

The creature tilts its head, eyes gleaming like molten obsidian. “You understand the price,” it says, its guttural voice both a statement and a question.

I nod, a smirk curling at the edge of my lips. “I understand perfectly.”

Beth’s distant scream cuts through the night, sharp and terrified, before it is swallowed by the shadows entirely.

And I lie back on my bed, content
