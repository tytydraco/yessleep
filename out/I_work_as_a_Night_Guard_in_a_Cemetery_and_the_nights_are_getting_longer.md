Thank you for reading about my experiences. 

I arrived at work just before 8, and was surprised to see the Cemetery Director waiting for me in the admin building.

“Hey Vic, what are you doing here so late? I would have thought you'd be long gone by this time,” I said, walking over to start a fresh pot of coffee.

“I have some bad news to tell you and a major request of you,” Victor said brushing at his prematurely grey hair. There was a tinge of frustration in his voice.

“What is it?” I asked, pulling up a chair and bracing myself for the answer.

“Kyle no longer works for us anymore. There was an incident with that old tree outside of the cemetery and when confronted about it he blew up. It was decided that he would resign from his position rather than be fired and face a third degree felony”

“Are you serious? He wasn’t the only one that chopped down that fucking tree, I helped him do it!” I shouted, jumping to my feet and knocking the chair to the floor.

“I am aware of your involvement,” Victor said, holding a hand up for me to settle and take a seat. I picked the chair up and sat back down.

“The difference between the two of you is that you are willing to listen and keep your sense about yourself. You also didn't bring the axe. I know that I can work with you and Kyle has proven time and time again that he is uncooperative.”

I sat and thought about his words with clenched fists. I took a deep breath and rested my hands on the table. After a few moments to regain my composure, Victor sat down as well.

“What is the favor that you want?”

“I need you to work six days a week to help cover for our lack of night guards. Eli has refused to work more than one day a week and I can't fully rely on Thomas and Jacob to pick up the slack. I can trust you to handle the responsibilities. I can trust you to handle the workload. I need you,” Victor pleaded, his voice straining. Clearly the search for more potential Night Guards wasn't going well.

“I want to quadruple my current pay rate,” I said unflinchingly.

“I will give you two grand a night, two grand each night will go to the damages you owe for the destruction of that tree until it is paid off. After that, I will guarantee that you will make whatever you want.”

I stared at Victor in disbelief. He was actually willing to entertain my outrageous demand. How could the cemetery even afford to pay such large amounts of money.

“Tonight, I will be joining you. If you are fine with these terms.”

“I guess…that would be fine,” I said, still slightly shocked that I was agreeing to work so much and for so much money.

“Great,” Victor said, clapping his hands and standing. “Just so you know, that tree was valued at over four million dollars, for your part in cutting it down you're on the hook for 1.2 million.”

My mouth fell agape to the contract I had just agreed to. I had committed myself to working six days a week with no end in the foreseeable future. Victor checked his watch and pointed at it before grabbing a flashlight and heading out. I poured myself a coffee and began the nightly ritual of locking the gates, mentally preparing for my first night working with Victor.

That night had been a series of mild inconveniences, one after another. First was a series of discarded fast food bags and empty soda cans. Then it began to downpour, the rain came down so hard that if anyone had snuck into the cemetery, I wouldn’t have been able to see them.

When I went into the admin building to get a hot cup of coffee, I knocked the pot onto the floor, shattering it into hundreds of pieces. I silently cursed at the mess when a leathery hand emerged from the mess. Pulling itself from the ground strips of soaked cloth clung to the leathery skin as it slowly rose up. I turned and left the admin building, deciding to clean the mess up later.

As the rain began to die down, I finally saw Victor looking at the splayed corpse of another sacrifice to the cemetery. Bathing in the blood below, a series of harpies and mermaids lapped at that blood on one another's bodies. Feathers and scales merged together as the fish heads of the mermaids nipped at the drops of blood falling on them. 

As I approached the beasts scattered in a rush, ignoring Victor completely. I looked at him with an expression of annoyance before approaching the mess. Just as I was looking at the trees the body was suspended from, it was knocked off by the mass of tendrils, cattails, pinecones, and onyx. The front of my already soaked jacket was sprayed with the mist of blood and what I hoped was just dirty rain water.

As dawn approached I was enjoying a short game of chess with Michael. Watching over us a figure with many shifting faces kept giving unsolicited advice as I moved Michael's knight to take my remaining bishop. The shifting faces leered at Michael and smiled at me as it spoke of returning what was lost if I opened the gate. Michael told the thing to fuck off as I wasn't opening the gate before 6 no matter what was promised. All six of the shifting faces merged to that of a scowl before it dragged its lumpy form away.

Moving my rook to take Michael's Queen, I knocked on the table before Michael conceded the match. His eyes grew dull as he said that he didn't like Victor.

“He reminds me too much of the mayor. Unwilling to close this cemetery for good like I have asked all of the previous cemetery directors.”

I looked at him in confusion.

“Yeah, just wrap some chains around the gates and weld them shut. No locks, no entry into the cemetery besides the fools eager to see what evils lurking inside. This place has been fed for over two hundred years, I don't know about you, but I think it could go without eating for the rest of eternity.”

I waved my hand for him to continue, shocked at such a simple solution.

“Without souls to feed this place, the cemetery would slowly have to feed on itself. I imagine that after some time the spirits would consume themselves to satiate the undying hunger of this place. The good fortune of the town would probably fade but is the cost worth it?”

With his question he faded and I looked down at my watch to see it was 6. I walked over to the south gate and unlocked it before going home.

I thought about what Michael had said. None of the cemetery directors would agree to just permanently close the cemetery. That Victor reminded him of the demonic mayor that had started all of this.

I wanted to know more, perhaps there was something I could do to stop any more sacrifices to that hellhole. Cutting down that tree had helped in slowing down the sacrifices to the cemetery but people would still sneak in. 

Perhaps, if the gates were permanently closed off, a few guards could just patrol the outside and chase off any would-be entrants. 

There were two things that I needed to know first.

Did Kyle still remember how to weld?

And second, what was wrong with Victor?
