So I’m at the call center, I’m by myself for now. If you read the last part you know things were getting out of hand, it sounds like they might be under control for now. And if they aren’t, I’ll be here to take your calls and send help. 

Dean had been staying at my place off and on lately, Allyson and I were working nights at the call center and he was pulling night shift at the police station. 

The three of us were growing steadily more exhausted, the call volume was through the roof. Dean was going out to violent crimes daily. It was wearing us out. 

Things came to a head Wednesday night. You see there’s this taco truck that parks a few blocks from my house. Allyson and I were tired of our own cooking so we got dressed up and walked to Angels truck. 

I was no stranger to his menu but Allyson was confused, “so what kind of food is this?” I didn’t understand her question, “what do you mean? Like is it authentic Mexican?” 

She shook her head, “no like what is a torta or casa or carne?”  “Allyson have you never had Mexican?” She looked embarrassed, “no I guess not”. 

So we had the sample platters. 

On the walk back we saw him, he was behind us but approaching fast. His seven foot tall stature easily visible, he pushed his way past people in his pursuit of us. 

Before we had a chance to run a siren whooped right next to us, tires screeched as Dean came to an abrupt stop. He jumped out of the car and quickly placed himself between us and the lumber jack from hell. 

“Hey! Stop right there!” To his credit the lumber jack obeyed. Dean rested his hand on his service gun, “ok now slowly lower the ax and place it on the ground”. 

The man’s presence was so intimidating I hadn’t noticed the weapon in his hand. The blade was as large as my head and was polished to a mirror like finish. 

The lumber jack looked at the ax than back to Dean. He shook his head and stepped forward. Dean raised his voice, “HEY! Hey back up right now!” 

The man ignored him, “come on man! No one needs to die today!” the lumber jack was nearly on top of Dean. 

Dean swore, he let go of his gun and drew his Taser. He fired it into the lumber jack who stiffened and grunted in pain before grabbing the leads and ripping it from Dean’s hand. Dean stumbled forward and the lumber jack swung a giant fist into his head. 

Dean flew back, his skull bouncing off the pavement. He was bleeding but managed to roll over, the lumber jack kicked him in the ribs sending him flying. He landed in a crumpled mess, Dean looked up at us then threw his hands in the air in frustration. “Get out of here!” 

In two enormous steps the lumber jack was at Dean’s side, he swung his giant ax! It caught Dean in the chest knocking him clear across the street and out of sight. 

I grabbed Allyson’s hand and we ran, when we got to my house the lumber jack wasn’t far behind. 

I knew it wouldn’t do much but locked the front door anyways. The gun was upstairs, I had stupidly left it on my nightstand. I rushed to the bottom of the stairs but froze, there was footsteps running across the second floor. Someone was in the house! 

Allyson grabbed my arm and pulled me back, “there’s someone up there!” Just then I heard a crash at the front door, an ax head was poking through it. In the distance I heard sirens but they were minutes away and we had seconds left to live. 

Allyson opened a door behind me, the basement door. “Abso-fucking -lutely not!” I yelled but she pulled me in with little effort. 

The door closed and we were bathed in darkness. We fumbled down the stairs until we reached the bottom and turned on our phone lights. 

Allyson went deeper and I hesitantly followed. I doubted this would buy is enough time for the police to arrive but it was better than dying instantly. 

That’s when I saw it, an old door propped against the wall. I think it was my houses original door, I just know I never tried to remove it from the basement because it was heavy as can be. 

Allyson walked up to the door, she gently traced its perimeter. Light suddenly engulfed us, we both looked up to see the lumber jack at the top of the stairs. 

We were cornered.

Allyson grabbed my hand, with her other hand she opened the door. The door that was leaning against a concrete wall. The same door that I had moved out of my way in the past. She opened it, and on the other side was brightly lit forest meadow. 

Allyson shoved me through just as that giant ax struck the concrete wall next to the door. I flinched at the shower of sparks. Allyson jumped through the door as well, as she was closing it I saw a second figure at the top of the steps. I couldn’t be sure but it almost looked like Jordan. 

The door closed and the air instantly felt different, there had been a strange hum to it before. Now it was calm, almost therapeutically so. 

I couldn’t bring myself to care about the weirdness that had just happened. I just wanted to take a nap, but Allyson kept pulling on me. 

“Come on Kylie, you can’t stay here. We have to get you back”. 

Man did my head feel light, I couldn’t really stand. Is this what huffing markers feels like? I knew I was being led somewhere. 

“Focus Kylie, you can’t be here”. 

I couldn’t help but laugh, “Allyson you nut, of course I can be here. Where ever I am is here so I’m always here no matter where I go”. Clearly this truth was so profoundly obvious she had to be able to see it. 

Allyson yanked my hair, like the little ones on my temple. I opened my eyes, how long had they been closed? Why did Allyson do that? It hurt! 

Was that a circle of flames floating in the air? 

I hit the ground, way to much feeling rushed into every inch of my body. Before I could stop myself I puked all over the ground. 

“fuck!” 

Everything hurt, another convulsion racked my body and I dry heaved a couple times. Even my eyes hurt. 

Allyson was leaning over me looking concerned. “Are you ok?” I shook my head, hell no I wasn’t ok. 

“What just happened Allyson? I feel like I got turned inside out, and where are we?!” 

I didn’t recognize our surroundings, we were clearly in some sort of forest but how did we get here? 

“That’s normal” Allyson replied, “it will all fade shortly. But we should figure out where we are and start moving”. 

My head was still too fuzzy to bother pressing her for answers. And not a nice fuzzy but more like having been kicked in the face by a mule fuzzy. 

I did have the wherewithall to pull out my phone, I had service. My first thought was to call Dean but then I remembered what had happened. 

Instead I went to Google maps, we were in the Darkwood Park. It looked like there was a gravel road not horribly far away. I mentioned as much and we decided to head for it, we needed backup. I tried calling 911 but there was no answer. 

I didn’t get a chance to try any other calls. My phone shut off on me, typical for this area. Everyone knows you don’t take electronics into Darkwood Park. 

Allyson dropped into a crouch, I followed suit. “What is it?” I whispered. Allyson looked hesitant to answer, “you should stay here Kylie. There’s something I need to do, it could be dangerous and you’ve already shown me so much kindness and I can’t bear the thought of you getting hurt”. 

I put my hands on my hips, “Allyson what are you talking about? First of, if it’s dangerous I will most certainly not let you go alone and secondly what aren’t you telling me?”

There was that aura about her again, nothing that could be picked out. Just a difference, like she wasn’t coded right. That’s when I saw the concrete building behind her, it was nearly invisible but I could see a key pad on it. 

“There really isn’t time Kylie, just know that I’m thankful for all that you did”. She stood and started towards the little concrete shed. 

I grabbed her hand stopping her, “I’m coming with you. And that’s final”. She pulled her hand free but didn’t argue. 

As we got closer I could see the concrete building was just ten by ten with a slanted roof also made out of concrete. The door was thick steel but Allyson typed in a code and it opened smoothly. Inside was almost completely dark, the only thing the building contained was a staircase that spiraled downward. 

Each step had a dim light illuminating it. I glanced at Allyson but she was already starting the descent. 

A lot of things weren’t adding up, “are your parents really in Europe?” I asked in a whisper. Somehow whispering felt required. 

“Yes but not in the way you understood it. I never lied to you, but I did conceal the truth when I felt it was necessary”. 

I thought that was a pretty bullshit excuse and told her as much. She didn’t disagree. 

“So what are we looking for?” We had reached the bottom of the stairs and were facing another door. “Records, I need to remove information before I can go home. I honestly thought I could get away with living here but it’s just not possible as long as they know I’m here”. 

Her answers were getting more and more annoyingly vague. “That’s not much of an answer Allyson”. 

She sighed and turned to me, “Kylie I’m not going to tell you everything. It would be counterintuitive if I did. Just let me know if you see computer things”. I was a bit miffed by her reply. I felt like she owed me some answers. 

We walked the dark quiet halls of the underground labyrinth for an hour. We found multiple rooms of unknown uses but none that held what Allyson was looking for. We went up a floor and everything changed. 

The walls went from bare concrete lit by naked bulbs every ten feet to painted walls and well lit corridors. There was even carpet on the floor. This part felt used, like people often traveled the area. 

And it didn’t take us long to see someone, far ahead a man in digital camo holding a rifle walked past the hallway we were in. He didn’t appear to have seen us but Allyson pulled me into the closest empty room. 

We stood in the dark not daring to breath. When it became apparent no one was coming I turned on the light. 

A voice deeper than any I had heard before spoke. “Well well well, what do we have here?” I spun around expecting some sort of guard, instead I saw something else. Something horrible. 

Behind a set of thick steel bars stood a dark skinned man, not like African dark but rather his entire body from head to toe was a shiny black color. He was entirely hairless, I can say entirely because he was nude, and unfortunately happy to see us. His eyes were a dark red and without pupils, behind him swished a tail . 

“It has been so long since someone has entered my room. What brings a pair so fine here to me?” I backed up until I bumped into the far wall. This thing shouldn’t exist, it was so wrong. In a similar way that Allyson had an aura that smelled of distant places the thing in front of us had an aura that oozed death and hatred. 

Allyson glared right back at the abomination, “we are not here for your pleasure, in fact we’re leaving right now”. It chuckled, “oh I doubt that”. Just then the door beeped and started to open inward. Allyson kicked it back shut. I heard cursing outside. Through the small window I could see at least four and guards. 

We were trapped once again. The death demon was enjoying himself, “where was it you were going changeling? Surely not into the hands of those waiting?” Allyson was biting her lip, she kept looking between that thing in the cage and the door. Finally she turned to the cage, “speak clearly wretch, what is your proposal?” It smiled widely revealing a long set of fangs.

“I have no quarrel with your kind, let me play with those who wish you harm. You will find it beneficial”. 

I couldn’t help myself, I asked “what are you?” The things gaze snapped to me, I felt such hate radiating off of it that I was almost sick again. 

“I am what they made me, the perfect tool for their needs. They twisted me, made me cold so that your world might be a little warmer. Yet my effectiveness scared them, so they locked me away for they lacked the courage to kill me”. 

I had to lean on Allyson, that thing had an effect on me that I couldn’t explain. Allyson spoke sharply, “Kylie is off limits, but do what you will with the others here”. 

She confidently strode forward and started typing on the keypad. I was horrified, she was actually going to let that thing out! “Allyson! Wait, don’t!” 

With a beep the cage opened. The thing inside laughed, it sounded like a legion from hell echoing out of him. He turned to smoke, than appeared inches from my face. His black tongue licking his lips, those dreadful eyes peering into me. He caressed my cheek, his fingers ending in long, thick fingernails. 

And then he was gone, nothing more than a faint hint of smoke remained. 

Instantly the hallway outside was filled with screams and gunfire. I covered my ears, the sound of flesh separating from bone was too much. 

I’m not going to describe the scene that waited for us when we left the room. Just know that there was no one to bother us as we walked out. 

It wasn't just the hallway, every room had victims in it. Every wall had a new paint job. The carnage was more than just a fight, that thing had taken a lot of joy in what it did to those people. Its art work will haunt me until the day I die.

We did finally find what Allyson was looking for, she set fire to the room. How she knew that would be sufficient I don’t know. I was done asking questions, I just wanted to go home and never think about this day again. 

We left the same way we had gotten in. Our walk through the woods was silent. Save for the group of helicopters that flew over head no doubt to the facility we had left. 

I had a feeling there was going to be a lot of empty houses in town, and I didn’t even know why. But I felt like I was partially responsible for it. 

When I reached the edge of town I had to call Greenbrier PD directly since 911 was still down. Adrian picked me up in a squad car. It was then I noticed Allyson was missing, I looked around for a bit but she was nowhere to been seen. And I didn’t really mind, sure she had tried to warn me but I felt like she could have been way more honest before putting me into that shit show. 

Adrian was babbling at ten million miles an hour like usual when I interrupted him, “Adrian have your heard anything about Dean?” 
“Dean? Oh yeah, Mr ax wrestler is fine. His body armor took most of the blow. A few broken ribs and some missing molars. Shoot half the precinct would be ecstatic to have gotten off that easy. I’m telling you girl, we gotta get you back to your desk. Shit be wild, wild I tell ya”. 

Adrian did just that, he dropped me off at the call center. The lights were out so I had to start the backup generator. I tried not to think about the blood splatter across one of the desks. 

With the power back on, put on my head set and answered the first call. 

“Greenbrier 911 what is the nature of your emergency?”
