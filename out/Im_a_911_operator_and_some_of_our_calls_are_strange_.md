I’m going to have my work cut out for me. Kylie here with another update on the crazy 911 call center in little old Greenbrier. 

A few comments, please stop trying to find me. I’m not interested in dating anyone and you come across as really creepy. 

I also don’t want to talk about Jordan, some of you have speculated that he is not dead and that might be true. Either way I don’t want to think about that day. 

That being said my mama didn’t raise a quitter. I’m being cautious with my investigating as I don’t know the intentions of the people in charge or my new coworkers. But I will continue to unravel this shit show. 

“Who knows what they’ve been signed up for?” I asked the five individuals in front of me. It was a cringe line but I’ve never been much of a public speaker. 

Krista held up a folder with a look of detachment, “we’ve been briefed. I think we can handle answering some phones”. She turned and walked to the nearest desk. 

Dale spoke up, “like she said toots, we’ve choked a few snakes so listening to the horn is a nothing”. I wasn’t entirely sure what he meant but apparently it was enough because he took the desk next Krista. 

Stephan raised his hand almost timidly, “ma’am our briefing said that we are to learn from the best. Am I to assume you are the best?” I shook my head, “no I’m not, I’m just the only one left”. 

Stephan nodded, “that’s good enough for me”. He shook my hand, his bear sized mitten enveloping mine. “I’ll be on observation”. 

Padric gave me a light hearted mock salute and followed Stephan over to where Krista and Dale were sitting. 

Shang shook my hand as well, “I am sorry about my first impression. I promise I’m capable of doing the job, do you have any tips?” 

His eagerness reminded me of Allyson, hopefully things go better for Shang. 

“Trust your gut and don’t assume anything”. Shang pressed his lips into a grimace, “that’s pretty vague but I’m sure we will catch on”. 

With that out of the way I could start training. Krista and Dale would take the first shift but the whole crew was going to stay for a couple hours to get a feel for the job. 

I could tell none of them were taking it seriously. I didn’t know their backgrounds but I doubted they were as prepared as they thought they were. 

We went over the basics, how the call lines worked, phone tracking, calling in codes to the PD and FD dispatch. 

They all looked pretty bored and I couldn’t blame them, this part of the job was easy enough a trained monkey could do it. And if they were lucky it would stay that way. 

We fielded a call within the first hour, an elderly lady had fallen down and needed assistance. 

Krista was calm and professional with her and stayed in the line until help arrived. Just a simple call, Krista looked pissed off though. 

Dale kept chatting away while eating pistachios, I thought maybe that was what had Krista worked up. 

With nothing else happening I sent Shang, Padric and Stephan away. They would be back in six hours for the night shift anyways. 

I sat where Jordan used to, the sleek black metal desk looked out of place. It felt surreal to be sitting there going over Krista’s report. 

Her hand writing was immaculate and she had gone into detail on everything. There was nothing to add so I filed it away. 

I pulled out a book and leaned back. 

I only got about two pages in before Krista cleared her throat loudly. “Is this all we do? Just sit here and wait?” 

I nodded, “pretty much, some days are busy and others are slow”.

 Krista scoffed as if offended by the very thought, “this is bullshit, why are we even here?” 

I didn’t bother answering, it’s not like I had anything more than an educated guess. “Why pull a horses tail when oats will git you there?” 

I don’t think Krista had anymore of an idea as to what Dale meant than I did. Ignoring both of them I went back to my book. Or at least that’s what I wanted them to think, in reality I kept a careful eye on them. 

The minutes turned to hours, Dale was softly snoring in his chair and Krista had an impressive house of cards built. I felt myself drifting off, I nearly flopped out of my chair when the phone rang. 

Krista’s hand shot out like a viper, she pressed the answer button. “Greenbrier 911 what is the nature of your emergency?” Her voice had that agonizing tone professional people use when trying to sound nice. 

I put on my headset and patched into the call. I listened as Krista calmly talked a lady through a car wreck. To her credit she did everything by the book. There was a lack of empathy though, it wasn’t anything in particular that she did. But the feeling was there. 

After the call Krista turned in another highly detailed flawless report. I barely caught the report as Krista tossed it across my desk. 

Seeing they had things under control I informed them I was going to get some sleep and to call me if anything weird happens. 

I could tell they both felt like the job was the easiest thing in the world and I hoped it would be. 

The ringing of my alarm pulled me from the incomprehensible dream that had slid its way into my brain. I shuddered, I couldn’t remember any details but it had been a dark, viscous and slick thought. 

I needed a shower to wash it away. I stood under the warm water until it turned cold. My skin tightened under the frigid liquid yet I hesitated to move away. Doing so would signify the start of a new day.  A new shift at the call center. 

I threw on a hoodie and my fat girl jeans, I didn’t care about appearances. I had more people to train today and since yesterday had been uneventful I was expecting shit to hit the fan today. 

When I arrived Dale and Krista had already left. Shang’s voice echoed loudly from within the room, what ever he said caused Stephan and Padric to laugh loudly. 

After taking a steady breath I walked in. The noise died almost instantly, the three of them stood up a little straighter. 

“Ma’am, we are ready to receive your orders”. Stephan stood nearly at attention as he spoke. 

Once again while Shang and Padric wore suits Stephan was rocking a “vote for Pedro” T-shirt and jeans. “At ease” I said with a smile. “I don’t have any orders, you know the basics. Just let me know if you have any questions or need help”. 

Shang and Padric were sharing some sort of silent conversation. By elbowing Shang with a decent amount of force Padric got him to speak. 

“So I I have a question, why are we here? Where is everyone else? Like shouldn’t you be able to just hire people from town? And even if you can’t why would someone pay us to be here?” 

I crossed my arms and sat on my desk facing the three men. “That is a lot more than one question”. 

Shang looked embarrassed, “sorry I guess there’s just a lot on my mind”. 

“I tell you what” I said to all three of them, “I’ll answer one question of yours for each question of mine you answer, deal?” 

The three of them shared a look, Stephan shrugged his oversized shoulders nonchalantly. Padric thought about it the longest before finally nodding in agreement. 

“Ok” agreed Shang, “first question, what happened to the previous employees?” 

Fuck 

I was really hoping that wouldn’t come up. “I think they died. I saw one… well I saw him take a shotgun to the face but I’m not sure if that counts”. 

Shang’s brow furrowed in confusion. “Ok I think that needs more explaining”. “He attacked us, and the previous manager stopped him”. I said. 

They didn’t look satisfied with my answer, I wasn’t sure how much I should tell them. The last thing I needed was for them to think I was crazy. 

“That was your question so now it’s my turn, where did you guys come from?” “Fair enough” said Stephan, “myself, Krista and Dale were recruited from the Marine Corp. Padric was a Ranger flunky and C-man Shang was in the Navy. We were approached either when we were looking to re-up or for some of us, when we found ourselves in trouble. They offered really good money so here we are”. 

It looked like Shang was about to ask another question but Padric cut him off, “my turn, like Stephan said, we’re all from differing backgrounds of a similar category. So it’s a little weird that someone would pay us to come here and answer phones. Now that you mention the previous employees all dying or otherwise disappearing it makes a little more sense. So my question is, what’s wrong with this place?” 

I laughed, probably not the best reaction but it just popped out. 

“Sorry, it’s really not funny. It’s just, well I don’t know what’s wrong. Growing up here gave me a certain disposition towards unusual things. But lately everything has escalated. Here’s what I can tell you, the call center must stay operational at all costs. And never take things for granted”. 

As if to emphasize my point the phone rang, Stephan leaned over and hit the green button, “yo Greenbrier 911 how may I be of assistance sir or ma’am?” 

 He winked at me as he talked. The caller replied and Stephan’s grin faltered, leaning over I pressed the speaker phone button allowing all of us to listen in. 

“Raccoons are here again and I’ll be damned if they aren’t looking for a fight!” The voice was that of an angry male. Stephan sat up a straighter, “hey now let’s slow down mister. You say raccoons are in your house? Have tried shooing them out the door?” 

I face palmed, everyone knows you don’t engage with Greenbrier trash pandas unless you want a very intense interaction.

 The voice yelled back, “the big one already took my knife block, I’m not going anywhere until I know they’re gone!” 

I cut in, “sir what is your address, we will get animal control out there as soon as possible”. 

“1132 Crustacean Court, tell them the bastards are armed”. 

“Yes sir, I’ll will. Until they arrive please stay in a safe location”. I turned speaker phone off, “Stephan, stay on the line with him and get any important info the you can”. 

I typed out a report to Greenbrier PD, “the rest of you watch and learn. Once we have an address and a threat level we can send in police officers. They will want as much info as possible so always stay on the line with the caller”.

Adrian was dispatching, he confirmed they had received the message and had a unit on the way. 

While I double checked the callers address with the pinged location Padric asked a question I knew was coming. “What’s the big deal? Is there a rabies outbreak in the area?” 

I shook my head, “no. Let’s just say the raccoons in this area have been a constant issue for awhile. They can be very aggressive when provoked, you’ll understand when you cross paths with one”. 

There was a police scanner on my desk, plugging it in and waited for it to power up. It was a little different than our previous model but I managed to get it going before the police arrived at the address. 

Officer one: “Greenbrier PD anyone here?” 

A fist banging on the front door could be heard. 

Officer one: “I am entering the house. Please remain calm”. 
Officer two: “yo French they got into the wine cooler”.
 Officer one: “alright, hang tight. I’m gonna grab the twelve gauge”.

Foot steps raced out the door. The caller yelled out from the bathroom, “hey! Get back here! You are required by law to protect me!” 

Officer two: “shut up man, we’re not looking to get torn up. Just chill while we search the house”. 

The first officer returned and we listened as they searched the house room by room. Finally once it was all clear they got a report from the homeowner. Nearly three grand in missing items was reported. 

Stephan filled out his report. Much like Krista it was professional and crisp. I let them goof around for the remainder of their shift. I knew the calm wouldn’t last, it never does. 


It almost did though, things were remarkably quiet for nearly a week. I was starting to feel like maybe Greenbrier was back to its normal self. 

Then Krista quit. It was another slow day. A few calls about things like a stranger in the woods, a serial dingdong ditcher and someone pied someone else’s car. Imagine egging but with cherry pie, a terrible waste of pie but not something interesting enough to keep Krista engaged. 

Krista had been working with Stephan and Padric. At the end of her shift she came up to my desk, “I want you to know I won’t be returning tomorrow. This isn’t what I signed up for”. 

Padric looked over from his desk, “you sure about that? We got a contract”. Krista flipped him off, “mind your own business. So, Kylie I’m heading out of town. This place is a little too chill for me”. 

I thanked her for sticking it out as long as she did but I think she almost took it as an insult? Anyways I wasn’t sad to see her leave, she was stiff and really brought the mood down. 

A few hours later Shang and Dale were settled into their routines. I was finishing my masterfully crafted doodle when the phone rang, Shang jumped at the opportunity. 

“Heeeeeello, Greenbrier 911 how…” The caller cut him off so loudly I could hear her without tapping into Shang’s line. “Shut up Conner. I know who I called”. 

I put my own headset on as Shang replied, “hey Krista, what’s up?” 

“A deer ran into the road as I was leaving town. My car needs a tow but I can’t get a call out to anyone but 911”. 

“Weird, I can probably send a tow from here. Where are you at?” 

Krista was quiet for a bit, “Conner? If the deer was pregnant could the faun still be alive?” Shang scrunched his face in confusion, “yeah probably for a little bit. Why?” 

Call it premonition or just plain old experience but something was wrong, I could feel it. My body was tense as I waited for Krista to reply. 

“It’s, it’s moving. Not the deer, something inside of it. I can see it under the skin”. A crack rang out, Krista yelled in surprise, “Shit! It’s breaking it’s way out, it literally just wrecked the rib cage and I can see it pushing against the skin. It doesn’t have hooves, why doesn’t it have hooves?!” Krista’s voice rose in panic.

I started tracing her phone immediately. Shang yelled out, “Krista what’s going on?” 

The trace wasn’t working, I was getting locations all over the place. 

Dale was watching us, I couldn’t put a finger on it but something was off about him. 

More horrified screams filled the room, “please! No, no, no! Fuck off!” Shang called out, “Krista where are you? What’s going on?” 

A gun shot rang out, followed shortly by two more. The snapping of branches and Krista’s heavy breathing was still audible. Shang was calling out to her, then he stopped. 

Krista cried out in pain, she whimpered quietly. Her last gasp was cut off by a wet squelching sound. Shang looked at me, his face pale and eyes wide. With a trembling finger he turned up the volume, I could now hear what before only he could. 

Slurping of fluids and the smacking of lips filled the room. 

I nearly jumped out of my skin when Dale explosively slapped his desk. Jumping to his feet Dale pulled a handgun from his desk and slid it into a hidden waistband holster. 

“When the molasses gets thick you best turn up the heat”. My computer dinged, Krista’s phone had called us from a side road. She wasn’t anywhere near the road out of town. Dale was out the door in a flash, a minute later I heard the engine of his Tahoe roaring into the distance. 

I sent the police a message, ongoing homicide of unusual origin, and the location. 

Before we had time to process what just happened the phone rang. “Shang” I called out, “the phone”. He looked at me in disbelief, “what the about Krista?” 

“The police are on their way, now we have a job to do”. I nearly gagged at the realization that I sounded just like Jordan right then. 

Conner Shang might have some things in his past that the others looked down on him for but to his credit, he answered the phone with a polite and professional tone. 

“Greenbrier 911 how may I help you?” The lady caller answered, “I’m sorry to be a bother but those posters do say to call if we find something unusual”. Shang asked, “and what kind of unusual are we talking about ma’am?” 

“Well it’s just that my lawn was soft this morning, and I know that doesn’t sound unusual but it wasn’t soft yesterday. I told my husband and he decided to check it out. Sure enough Edgar found that his beloved grass had a problem. He thought maybe a pipe had broken so went to the shed and grabbed a shovel”. 

The old lady sighed, “well he had barely punctured the soil when the ground rumbled. A slight chasm opened up under Edgar. The walls of it were pink and organic, Edgar always paid so much attention to the yard. I don’t know how he could have missed something like this. Anyways I really do need to be going, the roots quieted Edgar down nicely. He can finally spend the rest of his life with that damn lawn”. 

The line clicked, Shang stared at me blankly. I thought maybe he had broken mentally but he finally spoke. “Kylie, what the hell is wrong with this place?”


Shang had asked a very difficult question, one I had blown off the day he asked it. But you know what? I wasn’t going to be Jordan, I wasn’t going to hide things and let people live in the dark. 

Krista’s encounter was three days ago. She was still missing, no sign of her or her car. Absolutely nothing, agent Planck stopped by the day after and told me Krista had been reassigned somewhere else at her request. And that I would receive someone new if I couldn’t source another employee locally. 

His story smelled like bullshit, and not the fresh warmed by the sun kind. Rather more like the aged in the bottom of a lagoon for two years kind. 

Oh and I think who ever pays Planck and Stark has someone renting across the street from me. The previous tenants have been gone awhile, I haven’t seen the new tenants but there’s a lot of movement behind the blinds. 

That would solve the mystery as to how it got fixed up so fast. Anything is possible with enough money. 

I’ve gathered everything that I know into a folder. I’m going to do my best to explain to Shang, Padric, Dale and Stephen what’s been happening. I know they’ll have a lot of questions so before I do so I need check something out. 

I need to get into the call center basement.
