I never really believed in God or any religious stuff as of now, I always thought that was just another way to cope with the fact that we’re all gonna die someday, but what I witnessed a few nights ago, is either an angel, or a demon

For a couple of months now our town has experienced multiple blackouts late at night.

Most people just sleep through them, but not me.

I work the nightshift at this gas station a few block outside of town, it’s a shitty job but the alternative was becoming a janitor at the local school and I don’t wouldn’t want to get close to those brats even if I don’t was in an Hazmat suit.

Shift are uneventful and slow, the only company I have is my buddy Pete, who just finished his shift at a local fishing store.

The guy drinks like a fuckin’ elephant and it’s a shame to let the beers in the freezer go to waste.

One night as me and ol’ Pete were chugging down on a couple of cold ones, the lights went out once again.

After a whole month of this bull crap, I got tired of it and wanted to figure out what the hell has been goin’ on at the power plant.

That thing’s brand new, so I doubt it would start to malfunction out of the blue like that.

“Maybe it’s those dumbass kids again”, I thought  “being idiots like always meddling with the cables like they’re toddlers with bleach, saw some of them do dumber things”

I looked at Pete and told him I was goin’ out there to check on the power plant, see what the hell’s happening up there.

That motherfucker was wasted, he just nodded at me laughing like an idiot and delivered the nastiest burp I’ve ever heard.

“I’ll just go there myself then” I said out loud as if the shell of a man sitting beside me would understand me.

Nobody’s gonna pass through the town anyway so why should I care if the only person left in the gas station was the human equivalent of a sack of potatoes.

The power plant is deep in the woods, at the end of a man made trails, once used by the woodcutters back in the day before the whole place became a national reserve.

The forest kind of spooked me when I was a kid, those tall spiky pine trees, moving up towards the heavens as if they were holdin’ up the sky, it felt sacred somehow, and it’s still does.

I know it’s hard to understand for big city folks, with their big grey skyscrapers, but when you live in a small town in butt fuck nowhere, you feel powerless in front of something as big as that tall, green endless expanse.

The trails are surprisingly complex, with hundreds of ways to get lost in and very few signs to help you get around.
Late at night the park rangers are all sleeping soundly in their little Cabin’s, so they won’t be of much help and I don’t want to disturb them with my bullshit unless I’m sure someone’s getting into trouble.

It was scary out there you know, I felt vulnerable, there wasn’t even the sound of crickets keeping me company, it was just me and my footsteps on that lonesome trail with only an old flashlight shining a feeble light in front of me.

The sky was fully covered by the foliage, not a single ray of moonlight fell onto the ground, as if the woods were absorbing all light.

A couple of strange things happened as I made my way to the power plant.

The path split a couple of times, but some of these trails didn’t appeared on the map.
It’s brand new though, it was made right after the power plant was open, did somebody build new trails just to fuck with people?

No it can’t be, you can’t just make a trail as a prank, it takes time to make sure these things work right.

Then there was that noise

Some ear piercing ringing that happened out of nowhere only to disappear the same way as it happened.

It made fall to my knees the first time I heard it, it was as if someone put a megaphone near a wood chipper, and my ear was right beside it.
I grew some resistance to it as I went along, but every time i heard it I was a bit thrown of balance.

Then, as I was about to reach the power plant, I saw a glow, a soft bluish glow illuminating the path in front of me.

I turned off my flashlight and amped up my pace, I wasn’t sure what it was, but it compelled me to get closer, to see where it came from.

What I witnessed at the plant, what emitted that light, it was something out of a dream

Over the structure a large figure extended towards the sky now free of the oppressing embrace of the woods.

It had a myriad of root like tendrils protruding from what I assume was its torso, they were holding tight to the the countless rows of solar panels, glowing with that shade of light blue that brought me towards the thing.

The body looked human, but it was emaciated, it’s rib cage clearly visible under its leathery grey skin.

It had arms too, but they were too long to be human, with wiggly elongated jointless fingers that moved like tentacles.

It’s head…. It’s head was a flower I think, a beautiful glowing blue bud with white dots standing on top of a long stem with smaller arms similars to those on the torso branching out like leaves.

It wiggled in a slow undulating motion, like a dance or some form of trance like state.

Blue sparks popped around it like small fireworks spreading small energy particles that faded out into the air.

In all its grotesque and inhuman appearance, it was….. beautiful

I felt tears rolling down my cheeks, and I’m not one to cry often, but this was something else, it was something so outwardly and divine, that I couldn’t help but feel…. just feel

I can’t really explain what was going on inside my head, but I couldn’t look away, I was entranced in the sight of this being, is this what religious people feel when inside a church, is this how it feels to believe in something greater than you.

The creature’s bud then opened, reveling a shining bulb that looked like a small white sun.

A gentle calming whaling filled the air around the being, then the sound amplified, and the stars in the sky started glowing brighter and brighter.

The being’s bluish glow also became stronger and stronger.

I closed my eyes and covered them with my hands.

The light was so strong, so warm

Then the chorus stopped, and the light faded.

The thing was still there, it’s glowing stopped and the bud on its head was closed once more.

It’s tendrils unraveled as they let go of the panels.

As the sun started to rise, the being slowly took flight, and like a jellyfish swimming in the ocean went back deeper into the woods.

During the entire walk back to the gas station I was in shock, my eyes swollen from crying, my knees shacking, I didn’t even realized I was out of the woods when I found myself back at the station.

Pete was still there, asleep in his chair, covered in his own puke surrounded by countless empty bear bottles, a much different sight to what I previously witnessed.

I want to show him what I saw in the woods, he needs to know, everyone needs to know.

The feeling I felt that night, it’s something that cannot be described with words, I need to go back in the woods, I need to get closer to it I need to understand.

I need to hear the song of the stars again and again and again…..
