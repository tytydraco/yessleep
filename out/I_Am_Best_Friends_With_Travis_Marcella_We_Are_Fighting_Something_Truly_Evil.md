I was sitting down with the others as I watched Travis walk in the building, He quickly made his way towards the table and sat down. I heard the door creak quickly after and saw some guards as well as some guy in a suit walk in.

"Sorry i'm late, the facility has been overthrown and we cannot return anytime soon". He said

The soldiers glanced at him, expecting him to say Just Kidding or something but he only had a grim look on his face as he pulled out what looked like a blue oval that was around 3 feet in diameter.

"As you may all know, The Pilgrim has harnessed power from Yellowstone Volcano and we need to destroy it". He said, "This is a bomb that if placed into the Caldera, will cut off the Pilgrims power and stop it from becoming even more powerful". He stated.

"Wait- you're dismissing the elephant in the room here, Director". Jayden said.

"Yea, what happened at that facility of yer's"? Martin asked.

"Kyle and a couple others have been rallying a secret group to overthrow the facility and use it for their own purposes. They tried to kill me but I escaped and took a helicopter with my trusted guards to Yellowstone so we could finish the job here". The Director stated, "We need to kill this thing before it escapes the National Park-". He went to say but I felt an overwhelming rage at the Director. How DARE he just walk in and expect us to do his bidding.

"You want our help NOW?! I'm not gonna do your dirty work and risk me and my friend's lives"! I snarled.

Travis quickly diffused the situation before I got physical and stuck a deal with the Director despite Me and Bryson protesting against it.

"After this mission, we NEVER help you again and we wish to do what we want, and not be restrained by the facility". Travis stated boldly.

The director chuckled and said, "Yea, sure, it's not like you're asking for something big but I expected nothing less from you". He smirked.

I was about to grab him when I decided against it, It was no use attacking someone who could aid us.

"A deal's a deal". Eddie stated and held out his hand for Travis to shake.

They shook hands and Eddie told us his plan...

Martin and Jayden were to Distract the Pilgrim using the helicopter that held 2 large mini-guns. Me, Travis and Bryson were tasked with reaching the Caldera and Eddie and his soldiers were to set off a large explosion at the motel when Martin and Jayden lured the Pilgrim nearby. Before they explode the motel, Me, Bryson and Travis are to set off the bomb, weakening the pilgrim. Once the mission was over, we were all to meet up near the destroyed motel.

"We don't know how to set off the bomb". Travis said.

"Oh- uh, It's really easy, just press the Orange button at the bottom of the bomb. It will set a 30 second timer so you can get away from the explosion radius". Eddie said.

"Wait wait wait, Are you all forgetting something actually IMPORTANT"??! Bryson said, clearly annoyed.

I stared at him, confused.

"We need weapons"! He said when nobody responded.

One of the guards sighed as they took out a large case filled with a large water gun and 3 water bottles for everyone.

"W-What the hell are these gonna do"?! Bryson asked.

"They are actually extremely effective against the Pilgrim since it's immune to regular bullets. This is a prototype of H209, Which is water that is unable to turn into a gas and is extremely cold". Eddie stated.

"Isn't that basically liquid nitrogen or something-" Travis went to ask but Eddie cut him off.

"There's no time for dumb questions, we've delayed the plan long enough. Lets go". Eddie stated.

And with that, we were all led out of the motel. I was given the bomb because it was extremely heavy even for the 2 trained guards. Travis and Bryson held their water guns close but then I heard Bryson whisper something to Travis. 

"Hey, you still got her"? He asked.

"Oh, yeah sure". Travis said, handing him his desert eagle.

He gave Travis his water gun as some sort of trade off.

We all watched as the helicopter flew above and went slowly out of sight.

I had no interruptions most of the Trip towards the Caldara- I mean, Caldera, But the forest was eerily silent, even for my impeccable hearing.

We were walking through a tight passageway with a lot of trees and rocks in the way. I struggled to get past as I was pretty large and was holding a bomb so Travis and Bryson had to help me get through.

"Wait, I just remembered, How are we supposed to know when the pilgrim is at the motel"? Travis asked.

"Don't start having a panic attack on us" Bryson joked, pulling out a radio from his pocket.

"Oh, phew". Travis sighed.

"Hey, Darius you've been pretty quiet, how are you holding up"? Travis then asked.

"Something is off" I responded.

"What do you-" Travis went to say but then a large Sasquatch came out of the nearby treeline.

"Is that Bigfoot"?! Travis asked in shock.

I didn't have time to answer Travis as Bigfoot ran straight towards us, fist's balled, ready for a fight.

Bryson quickly took out his desert eagle and shot Bigfoot in its eye.

"RUN"! Bryson shouted.

Though I was not someone to run from a battle, I obliged as I was to protect the bomb and reach the Caldera.

We ran through the forest, hoping to get some distance from the thing. Eventually we took a break and Bryson took out a map. Conveniently, we were pretty close to Yellowstone Volcano. We continued running towards the location and eventually we reached a clearing.

We thought we were in the clear when suddenly, Many lava creatures emerged from the Caldera and ran towards us, letting out shrieks and screeches.

Bryson tried shooting them with his desert eagle but it barely did anything. I remembered the water guns and handed one to Bryson and began firing at the creatures.

I stood helplessly as I tried to figure out what to do.

It took a couple shots to kill even one of them but Travis and Bryson were holding up well against the endless horde.

We all then heard a radio crackle to life around 3 minutes into the battle.

"Guys, you have 1 minute to set off the bomb". Eddie said from the radio.

Travis quickly handed Bryson his water gun and told him to cover us. He then jumped on my back as I charged towards the Caldera, hoping we could get past.

Halfway through a couple of the lava monsters noticed us and chased us. They were getting closer and closer despite my speed but then we both heard a couple shots go off from behind and we were no longer being chased.

We reached the Caldera and with all my strength, I leapt into the air and launched the bomb into the middle of the Caldera after hitting the button. Then landing on the opposite side of the Caldera.

After 30 more seconds, we heard all the lava monsters screeching as they died. We all then heard a loud screech from the Pilgrim as it shrieked in pain.

Bryson ran over to congratulate us but when he was halfway around the Caldera to reach us, Lava tendrils erupted from the Caldera and began attacking me and Travis.

I was grabbed by my foot and yanked into the air, Travis grabbed me and held onto the nearby tree for dear life as I was slowly losing my grip.

Bryson saw what was happening and shot at the lava tendrils that had grabbed me. It worked and I only suffered some minor burns on my leg that healed quickly. While I was tending to my wounds, Travis went to help Bryson but then I heard a scream and looked toward the two.

I watched as Travis ran into danger, desperately hoping to save Bryson despite him already being too far gone. I blocked his passage and prevented him from dying to the creatures.

I watched as with one final effort, Bryson threw his desert eagle towards Travis's direction and it landed a couple feet away. Travis slowly picked it up and looked at it mournfully. The tentacles were getting closer but he didn't seem to care. I picked Travis up and ran towards the direction of the motel. 

I heard Travis silently sob into my shoulder as we reached the motel.

We saw that the Pilgrim had grabbed the helicopter and Eddie and the guards were fending off some lava monsters. There was a detonation lever a couple meters away. I ran towards the lever but was suddenly slapped away by one of the Pilgrims lava tendrils. I was rammed into a tree and fought to stay conscious. The pilgrim has this aura about him that I finally felt to its maximum, He was slowly trying to get into my brain. I could hear him whispering inside my mind.

"Why do you bother"?

"You won't be able to win this fight, even if you were 10 times stronger than you were now".

"Just leave".

"Is this even worth it"?

"You should escape instead of worrying over such minor things".

"Isn't that what you wanted"?

I was about to give in when I heard Travis nearby and snapped me out of my daze, I quickly shook the thoughts out of my head and rushed to aid everyone else.

Travis,Martin and Jayden were surrounded by the lava monsters but with newfound determination, I rushed through them and grabbed all three of them, I ran towards the lever as fast as I could and thrust them towards it and told them to press the lever as I was blasted backwards by another lava tendril.

As I was slammed back, I crashed through several trees and landed with a thump on the ground.

Blood trickled from my nose and burn marks coated my body. I heard a large explosion go off and felt the shock wave. I went to get up but saw a tree about to crash into my side, I dodged out of the way and ran towards the motel.

I reached the motel and saw the scene unfold. I walked towards the Pilgrim with pure hatred in my eyes.

"You don't decide what I can and can't do" I whispered to the Pilgrim and slammed my claws into the Pilgrims chest, killing him.

I helped everyone out of the rubble and we finally had won...or so I thought.

A week later, we were staying at Bryson's house when I walked in on Eddie and Travis arguing. I overheard the conversation and out of anger, I punched Eddie into the wall but he didn't seem to mind.

"It's not our problem anymore". Travis stated.

"That's where you're wrong, you didn't complete the mission..." Eddie started.

"What do you mean"? Travis asked, confused.

"You said you would help me on the condition that after you helped me you would be free to do whatever you wanted. You're not done helping me yet and the deal isn't complete until we get the facility back under control. So you're helping me or the facility will still hunt you down and kill you and your friends". Eddie stated.

I looked in shock at how Eddie had twisted his words and somehow won the argument. I made a mental note not to trust him.

Night was approaching and after dinner I headed to the warehouse and decided to rest. I decided to type this out to explain my part of the story since Travis has done the same. He told me not to post but now I guess he changed his mind...

I'll keep in touch with you all!
