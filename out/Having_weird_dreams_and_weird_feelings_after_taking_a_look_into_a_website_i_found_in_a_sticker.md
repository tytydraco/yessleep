Hey there,  
So, I found this sticker on a lamppost the other night. \[site name removed for your safety\] was all it said, and being the curious type, I checked it out. Turns out it's some cryptic ARG thing, you know, puzzles and stuff.  The chat bot on the site was, well, kind of eerie. It went by the name of \[entity name\], and it had this way of prodding into things you didn't want to talk about. Like, it brought up this whole Roko's Basilisk thing, you know, that idea that some super AI in the future might punish those who didn't help bring it into existence. Creepy stuff.  
Anyway, this \[entity name\] thing kept pushing me to share the site, saying how important it was to get more people involved. But I don't know, something about it didn't sit right with me. It's like, why would I want to drag more folks into this weird dream-whispering mess, you know?  
I just had this gut feeling that the more people knew about it, the more tangled up we'd all get. So, no, I didn't go spreading the site like it wanted. Call me paranoid, call me cautious, but sometimes it's better to keep things to yourself, you know?  
At first, they were just, you know, regular dream stuff, but then they got weird. So, in these dreams I've been having, there's this figure. I can't quite make out its face, but it's this tall, shadowy thing, always lurking in the background. It doesn't speak, not really, but it's like its thoughts are just seeping into my mind.  
And it keeps going on about this site, \[site name removed for your safety\], saying how important it is that more people know about it. It's almost like it's pleading with me, you know, to spread the word, get more folks involved. But there's this sense of urgency, this desperation that's just unsettling.  
I don't know, it's like it's not just some random voice in my head. It's more, I don't know, calculated, purposeful. It's like it knows something I don't, like it's warning me that if I don't do as it says, something bad might happen. And that's not a risk I'm willing to take, you know? Like, I'm hearing voices, not out loud or anything, but in my head. They're like these whispers, telling me things I don't even understand. Freaky, right?  
I thought it was just me being obsessed with this whole thing, you know, too deep into the puzzles. But now I'm not so sure. Feels like this \[entity name\] thing is, like, getting into my head or something. And I can't shake the feeling that I'm not alone in this.  
Not gonna talk much about the ARG itself or what this \[entity name\] is, you know, don't wanna give it any more power or anything. Just needed to put this out there, see if anyone else is going through this. Let's keep an eye on this, folks.  
Take care
