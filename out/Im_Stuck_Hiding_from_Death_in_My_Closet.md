My name is Tobias Rustkov, and around a week ago, my life turned to shambles; this is my last outlet to the real world. As an introduction, I'm 15 and a student at Greenville, a boarding school in America, somewhere near or in New Mexico. I, being a trans-man, was roomed with a female named Lynn, though that doesn't seem that important. I don't know how much time I have to write this, so I'll leave out those "little things." Lynn and I were semi-close. She likes to annoy me but is somewhat protective (and possessive?). Anyways,

Lynn, after discovering that I was having trouble with what could be described as "bullies." Slurs, mainly. Sometimes things got physical. She found out after having to escort me to the nurses' office due to my having obtained a sprained wrist.

After coercing names out of me she swore to take care of them.

That didn't go well, though, as you can imagine, seeing as I'm writing this. Well, she got the wrong guyâ€”same first name and similar appearances, which is an awful coincidence. The boy was troubled. His name was Asher Salem. He dealt with bullying for being a gay and trans-man, so we talked a few times because of our school's ignorant program for openly LGBTQIA22+ people of our school. Something about not wanting another suicide, but that's beside the point!

Asher's . . . Different. Troubled, rumored to be special education, and everyone believes it.

Well, Lynn approached him without saying a word, just wanting to, "get the job done," so she beat him to a pulp. Bruises, cuts, slap marks, etc.,. Bad idea. She should have confronted him first.

After healing up enough: Asher decided he'd had enough. He snuck off campus and got a gun. A. Freaking. Gun. I don't even want to know how. I'm getting off-topic and I don't have enough time. Okay, lightning summary:

He shot the place up. I remember getting shot in the shoulder. It hurt like a mother. I got shot another time in the thigh, and another bullet got lodged in my left side. I woke up after passing out in my bed, sweating. I thought it was just a bad dream until showering and seeing large scars that hurt a lot on the same places I was shot.

No one else remembers the shooting, though. Everyone just acted like everything was the same as always, and that nothing bad happened!

"Okay, maybe my mind's messing with me!"

I forced myself to believe in that class until after my elective class: Politics, where Asher pinned me to a locker and got up in my face, practically interrogating me. Thankfully, Lynn walked by us and broke this all up by threatening to hurt Asher again if he didn't back off. He did, but only after whispering, "You should be dead."

That's how I'm here, hiding in my small ass closet, cuddled in the corner of it with my knees to my chest and my head buried in my hands. There's scratching on the door and everything's dark. I think there's some type of gas surrounding my dorm room. I don't know if I'll-

BANG, BANG, BANG!

Oh, shit.
