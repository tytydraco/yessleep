Friends, family, acquaintances, no matter who they are, they impact your life to some extent. Whether it’s help from a stranger, happy moments from friends past, or moments you’d rather forget from your parents. Every single little thing builds us up to who we are today. Some things require attention or they’ll fly by with no impact, others will collide with you so tremendously that it’ll rattle who you are as a person by virtue of happening. Maybe you’re attentive, and try to accept things, become better through them, and move on. Maybe you deny reality until it kills you. Or maybe, you’re a little like me.

My name is Henry Yaeler. Maybe some of you remember me from a post I made a year or two back about a train ride that reminded me what I wanted to do with my life. If so, welcome back, it’s been… well it’s been life… and a bit of death. Before I leave the internet for good though, I suppose it’s the least I can do to give those that helped me along the way some closure. I can’t thank those of you who sent me sources for my first steps enough. Even more so those who sent me actual packages. I am forever grateful to you, and this isn’t all talk, keep an eye out in your mail. Lastly, to the person who sent me four grand in a privatized digital currency, send me a new email to send the money to and I’ll get it back to you as soon as I can.

For the rest of you, I appreciate your patience. Given this is a public letter to those who helped me, I’ll try to keep everything following on topic. I’ve said my thanks, and I know why most of you are here, just, be sure you have some time, I have a feeling… I have a feeling this may take longer than I’m expecting. OH! One last thing, for anyone who hasn’t read my prior post, I will try to remember to put it in the comments or something.

The DMs started coming a couple days after my post, messages about if I knew what energy lines and spiritual conduits were. Some from self-proclaimed psychics telling me that my path ahead was “Doomed to fail” or, “wrought with certain death.” Maybe they were legit, maybe I’m reading too much into their B.S. Who knows? It was a couple weeks after when the first package came in, “Spiritualism, Energy, and Quantum States.” Throwing the packaging in my kitchen trash, I tossed the cinderblock of a book in the air a few times, questioning the wisdom in ignoring the fact my address had been leaked. I put the thought on the backburner's forgotten “warm” section, and flipped through the colossul tome. It only took me thirty minutes to shut the nonsense-filled book. From what I could tell, it was a bunch of pseudo-science BS written by some guy who managed to write the first ten pages 500 different ways. Whoever sent it, it wasn’t worth the roots of the stump it was printed on, it is currently in a landfill somewhere, and no I’m not sending you money for a new one.

In the following days, I received several books that, until just yesterday, I’d held onto. I’d learned how to tell which ones might be legit by book 15. Typically, those in the several hundred/plus word count range were crap. Since the useful books were mostly first or second-hand experience, they were almost always shorter, not eclipsing 100 pages. Essentially, if it reads like a textbook, it looks like a textbook, and it feels like a textbook, it’s probably not a textbook, at least for spiritual stuff.

Some time passed for research in a field of study that was mostly hearsay. Even with the legitimate textbooks, so much was just theory that I just had to combine everything into my own personal textbook. I tried to keep up with work, but in the end, I had enough savings to last me a year or so. I figured if it took longer than that, I’d head off and live in the woods or something. So that was my life, eating rice and beans for breakfast, ramen for lunch and dinner. Occasionally I’d mix it up with eggs, but yeah, I’d wake up, feel like shit, research, compile data, put it into a notebook, go to sleep. But even after putting together two composition notebooks worth of rituals, spiritual theory, and hyperdimension hypothesis, I didn’t have a way of getting back to my childhood friends. I knew where they must’ve been, but there was nothing useful on how to get there except, “It can only happen coincidentally.” and “You cannot enter the gaps in reality intentionally.”

I banged my head on the book-covered coffee table, trying to keep myself awake. Chewing my lip, the taste of iron glazing my tongue as I considered just finding a new job. All the resources that pooled into my lap told me I should leave things be, that there was no point in hope. But I couldn’t give up on my friends, so I sagged, flopping to the ground next to my laptop. It was opened to another useless page about energy lines or something. I stared at the screen, focusing and unfocusing my vision. My eyes stung with tears that refused to break surface tension leaving my eyelids to scrape them away. Blinking and letting a couple tears streak down the side of my face a message blinked in the bottom right of my laptop, “Gregor ‘lander ‘I know how to open the gap.’”

Chewing my lip, I grimaced, closing the message. Sitting back up, I grabbed one of the books I’d read a dozen times over, “Mysteries of The Gap.” After flipping through it, I’d confirmed it didn’t say it was impossible to intentionally get there, just that it likely couldn’t be achieved. Opening Reddit, I clicked on my messages, Gregor hadn’t sent anything new, but someone else had, someone with a blank username. Opening it, I found a link along with a password and username, “Two souls should be all you need to find your friends. But they may not be worth your bargaining power. Be vigilant, and when in doubt, seek out the infinite light.” The message was followed by an email and password.

I replied, “What the fuck man?” But the message never sent, the account didn’t exist anymore, yet his message never went away. “Could’ve used a bit more info jackass.”

Making my way to the kitchen, the only source of light I’d had on for days; I opened the cabinet. Sighing, I dragged out one of the three remaining cups of noodles.

As I stared at the rotating foam behind the metal mesh of the microwave, my eyes also rotated, focusing on the cup, then the mesh, back and forth. I’d lost my mind, and my body forgot I had one. Thinking on the message from the nameless person. What’s their deal? Are they messing with me? What if they’re not?

BEEP BEEP BEEP

I jumped, my eyes dug themselves out of the pit they were buried in, and I looked around.

BEEP BEEP BEEP

I stared at the microwave, the image of my kitchen leaving me oddly disturbed. Flinging the microwave open, I grabbed a fork, and sat on the counter, slurping the noodles down in silence. The shadows crawled toward me, but any time I shot a look at them, they’d already retreated. My heart pounded as I chugged the broth in one go. Dropping the cup from my lips, I gave the shadows around me a once over, before heading to the trash.

Tossing the cup and plastic fork, I slouched back at my laptop. Staring at the screen, I logged into the email the man had sent me. Following the crypto wallet link, it opened to a company named “Fetch Inc.” which had its toes in everything short of bounty hunting. The advertisements on the page were all businesses under this massive corporation I’d never heard of. Once I’d input the information and verified myself via the email, it opened to a wallet.

It read:“Balance: 2.2 HornetTo cash out, click \[HERE\] now.”

I scoff-laughed and closed the tab, finding a new message from Gregor.

“I can get you where you need to go. You down?”

I sighed, looking at the book I’d skimmed through minutes prior. Fuck it. “Look man, if you really can help me, we have to meet up first. Gotta be somewhere public.”

As I waited for a response, I found myself drifting the cursor toward tab restore. I wobbled my head back and forth, debating whether or not it was worth it. Fuck it, I can click away if it looks suspicious. Reopening the wallet, I stared at the “Cash Out” button, hovering my mouse. Clicking it, a window popped up.

“Upon cashing out your Hornet, you will receive them via van transport within 24 hours if you live in North America, South America, or Europe. If you live in Africa, Asia, or Oceania, it may take 2-7 business days. If you live in Antarctica, it will take between 7 and 30 business days via boat. If the terms are acceptable, click ‘Accept,’ otherwise, click ‘Decline.”

“Antarctica?” I chuckled, clicking accept. The tab closed on its own, a new window opening, “By clicking ACCEPT, you agree to our terms of service, including, but not limited to, location data-”

“Okay man.” I hit accept again, letting the notification fade away, along with my hopes of getting whatever money was allegedly in the account. Reopening my DMs, Gregor had responded.

“This sound good?” He sent me a link to a Waffle House, despite it being years since I’d been to it, the address was familiar.

I sat, staring into the kitchen, light flickering with my thoughts as a heavy wind picked up outside. Rain pattered against the window behind the sink. I stared, wondering if a thunderstorm was on the horizon. A sudden gust ripped past the complex, wobbling the windows. I blinked slowly, the light losing intensity. Unable to move, I continued staring at the window, it didn’t reflect the faintest hint of light. The periodic flicking of the lightbulb entranced me. Each flash dimmed the room more and more until I looked around, nothing in my vision, my laptop invisible. I sat for a while in the cave darkness, I was calm, unable to move anything but my head, yet relaxed.

Through the chasm of nothingness and time, a silhouette of somethingness and when made its place in existence. A being so large it encompassed everything in front of me. The faintest light emanating from me bounced off the entity like a crashing wave, sending light in all frequencies directly to my eyes. It grew, the longer I looked, the more blinding the light became. My eyes bled as the entity let out a rumble to shatter fluid.

Face melting at its voice, I shot up, still sitting beside the couch. The sun shone through the window, blinding me. Rubbing my arms, I repositioned myself. Laptop in lap, I tried to blink the figure away, but it was stained onto my pupils; a scar that still hasn’t left me.

I blinked again, shivering. Looking at the message from before, I typed a response…

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Staring into the void of darkness out the window, my mind wouldn’t let go of the figure. A simple depression remained, but any time I blinked it came back in full force.

“Can I help you?” A southern lady greeted me to my left.

“Just a coffee for now, I’m meeting someone.”

“Of course sweetie, take your time.”

She came back a few minutes later with a pot of stale coffee, pouring me a mug. I nodded to her and smiled. I hadn’t been to Waffle House since high school, but somehow, the smell was fresh in my mind. I’d been to several growing up, and while some smell like a musty ashtray, old syrup, or on one occasion, strawberry milkshake; the clearest smell in that moment was freshish bacon, eggs, and cigarette. Her feet crackled against the sticky tile as she walked away, followed by a new set of resin-coated footsteps.

“You Yaeler\_95?” A shaggy-headed dirty blonde wearing joggers and a hoodie held out his hand.

Looking up, I refocused, “Call me Henry.” Standing, I took his hand, giving it a firm shake.

“Yeah, of course, call me Greg.” He rubbed the back of his head, “Sorry I’m late, never really done this before.” His grip was firm, but he struggled to look me in the eyes, darting them around from my forehead to ears, to chin.

“You need a coffee or something?” I asked, sitting back down.

“That sounds fucking amazing.” He sat, melting into the seat. His eyes were like a raccoon with the flu, but there was a light twinkle in them.

“You drive in from Washington?” I chuckled, wondering how long he’d been awake.

“God no, I could never. Place is a hot zone.” Smiling, he relaxed into his seat; seeing the waitress from before, he waved her down, getting her to pour him a mug of coffee.

He took it black, power-chugging half the cup in one pull. As he set it down, he looked me in the eyes, “So, your friends.”

“Before we get to them…” I leaned forward, holding my chin up with my palm, slightly covering my mouth. “How’d you learn about the gap?”

Following my lead, he lowered his voice, and his eyes darted faster as if I was about to laugh at him. I understood, I wouldn’t talk to most anyone about the books in my apartment, let alone the fact I’d taken notes. “Found some books researching the spirit world. One of em had an analysis of empty planes between realities, they called it the gap. I sent you the book that goes over it.” I didn’t have to wonder which one, but I did have another question.

“Why’d you wait so long to contact me? Get lost?” A short breath escaped my nose.

“I wanted to give you a bit of time to absorb it, y’know. Despite it only having half the details, I thought it’d at least get you ready to save your friends.”

I jostled the answer around, tossing it between different corners of my brain.

“You alright?”

I jumped, and my vision cleared, the imprint of the being fading into temporary obscurity. “Yeah, yeah.” I scrunched my face, trying to remember what he’d said, “Yeah, guess we did.” Then I thought for a second, “Sorry, wrong words came out. You have the other half the answers, that’s why you said you know how to get to the gap.” What had he needed to go there for? “I don’t imagine you have a source on how to get there.”

“Yeah, the book don’t got shit for answers. But…” he let the statement linger as the waitress came by again.

“Can I get y’all anythin’ to eat? Or will it just be coffee.” She held a pot in her hand as she glared between us.

“Yeah, let me get the two-egg breakfast.” Greg said, not looking at the menu.

I looked between her and Greg, stuttering out, “I-I’ll get the same, separate bill.”

“Be right up sugah.” She smiled, turning to the kitchen, leaving.

I looked at Greg, waiting for him to continue, but he just stared at me, eyes gone, pupils dilated. “The book doesn’t have shit for answers, buuut?”

I waited. He blinked a few times, coming up for air, “Yeah, there’s a way. But it comes down to where your friends went missing.”

I chuckled, leaning back in my chair, “Last time I ended up in the gap, I was on a train nowhere near them.”

“Well the book didn’t get everything wrong, you can show up there by accident.”

“So I just happened to find them between realities. I remember an old tidbit about needles ‘n’ hay.” I snorted, rolling my eyes, reading to leave.

“Look, the way I understand it, people who have suffered have a looser grip on reality. They’re more prone to slip between the folds. I don’t know why you ended up finding them, but I know how we can find them again. And it all comes back to us going to the site they went missing. Happenstance versus intent.”

I chewed my lip, leaning back in, “So what, I’m less sane the closer I am to where they were last seen?”

He rolled his head back and forth, “I mean, I guess if you want to look at it like that.”

I leaned back, folding my arms, “I hop in, grab my friends, hop out, is that the plan?”

“Not necessarily. We can’t be sure we’ll be alone, so I’ll be joining you.” I raised an eyebrow, “Due to how murky the science is, I don’t know how it works, but I should be able to follow your lead into the gap.”

I sighed, biting my lip as I tapped my foot. Clamping my eyes shut, I took a final deep breath. “Alright, I’ll show you. But I’m a week overdue for a nap.”

\-----------------------------------------

As I pulled into a parking spot at the musty motel just outside my hometown, I noted the fresh coat of paint, maybe only a decade old. It wasn’t much, but I held out hope they’d taken care of the bedbug and flee problems.

Greg rolled to a stop in his matte red Prius. Hopping out of my car, he followed me into the main office. The inside had the faint odor of bad bone broth with a hint of spoiled milk, which only added to my previous hope.

We each got our own rooms and headed back out into the dry yet oddly warm winter night. Getting to the second floor, we parted, entering our respective rooms. I prepared myself for the dry crunch under my feet but was pleasantly surprised by a clean faux wood floor. “They got rid of the carpet.” I smiled, no longer concerned with the threat of bed bugs. The smell inside was like stale cleaner and the bottom of an ashtray, which was certainly better than the copper and vomit from the last time I stayed there.

I flopped on my bed, a groan reverberating from the building, “Can’t all be winners.” I muttered, chuckling to myself as the aether took me.

\--------------------------------

I was in a park, a light squealing coming from the neverwhere. The air was dense, and I struggled to breathe. It was night, no stars, no clouds, just a dim moon overhead, as if the sun couldn’t be bothered to reflect the sun’s light anymore. A crunch of frozen wood chips and mud resounded as I took a step, looking around. Nothing came into view, and I could only see about 10 feet in front of me. The odor of freshly cut grass crept into my nose as I looked around, taking another step.

Looking up, I found a familiar outline in the sky producing its own light. Nausea flooding me, I looked down. Four spindly red flowers at my feet like giant spiders sat there, off to the right, a small purple flower. Looking back up, the entity’s impression in the spots between spacetime grew eternally, expanding a mile a second, but the being never exceeded my field of vision. Its visage nothing more than an imprint, it said nothing, only reaching out a hand as if to rip me from my very soul. I jerked away breaking free from the frozen ground and sprinting full speed. Its existence encroached the sky around me as I ran. My legs flailed, trying to push me beyond physical limits. I glanced down, avoiding the gaze of the being beyond worlds, beyond the solar system, beyond the galaxy. The grass flowed against me, like sand under a retreating tide, I was running in place. The grass caught my foot and I fell, a rumble rattling my lungs, I coughed, hacking up years of mucus. My nose oozed what I couldn’t cough up, and when something stroked my back, my bladder released itself. I squeezed my eyes shut, but the being’s impression was still glazed over my pupils. Laying there, I whimpered, crying, not prepared to die.
