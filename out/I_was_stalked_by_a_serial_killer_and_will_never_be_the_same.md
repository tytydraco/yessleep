It all started when this guy asked me out at Starbucks. I was waiting for my drink and this extremely handsome but super arrogant man came up to me talking all kind of game. But I wasn’t having it.

He was just too much and I’m not the type of girl who’s into those kinds of guys.

He had been watching me for a while and I think he even followed me in. 

He didn’t take the hint and said something really stupid about my body. I was extremely irritated as I needed to call my best friend before work and this guy just messed it up. So, I really laid into him and said something really mean like, “Gawd, you’re boring A.F. Why don’t you crawl back under your slimy bridge you f’ing creep. What are you, like a pervy stalker? You’re probably some peeping tom who likes watching little girls sleep.” 

It was meant to get rid of him. 

His whole demeanor changed. His face distorted into something incredibly scary but then somehow twisted back into a charming smile. He then turned and left but stopped and turned back to say to me, “I’ll be seeing you.” And with that he sauntered off.

I didn’t think anything of it and went about my day.

That night, I came home to my small one-bedroom house that my mom left me. I got ready for bed and went to sleep. 

I don’t know what woke me, but I opened my eyes. There was a window above my bed. I had my drapes completely pulled open as this window faced the backyard. That night there was a full moon, and the moonlight spilled into my room. But along with it was a deep shadow that fell across me.

The shadow was a silhouette of what appeared to be a man watching me from outside the window. His facial features obscured in the shadows. 

I lay there frozen with fear. The silhouette didn’t move for what seemed like an eternity. It then moved off, confirming that it was a person.

I quickly sat up and picked up my cell phone and dialed 9**. But the call wouldn’t go through. I tried again. And again. The call just wouldn’t go through.

I got out of bed and went into the living room. I tried to turn on the lights in the hallway, but they didn’t click on. I tried the light in the living room. It also didn’t switch on.

I then heard a knock on the front door. I felt cemented to the hardwood floor. It then knocked again. I didn’t move or say a word.

It then pounded hard – BANG, BANG, BANG!

I then yelled, “get the f away from my place! I’m calling the cops!” I tried again but still the call wouldn’t go through.

The silhouette then walked by the front window. Then the side window. It was walking to the back of my house where I had a backdoor in my kitchen. 

I peered into the kitchen from the living room. I then ran in and grabbed a cutting knife and ran back out.

The backdoor had a window in the door. It had blinds which were closed tight. I stared at the backdoor. All was quiet. I then saw its doorknob jingle. It then stopped.

I held my breath and clutched my knife, wishing I had bought a gun.

The person then smashed through the door’s window.

I bolted to the front door, grabbed my keys, flung it open and fled. I heard the man break through the back door and take chase after me.

Outside, I found my car was gone. I couldn’t see it anywhere. 

I saw my neighbor’s door open and his light on. My neighbor Jerry was the nicest man. He was in his 70s and had lost his wife. He was all alone too and I felt like he kind of adopted me as his granddaughter. I quickly ran to his door. I yelled, “Jerry, help me! Please help me!”

I looked back as my stalker exited out of my front door. I then made the decision to go into Jerry’s place. I closed the door and locked it behind me. I yelled for Jerry. “Jerry, it’s Alice, your neighbor!  Please help me!”

I went to Jerry’s room to find a black tarp covering the bed and Jerry’s cut up and bloody dead body resting on it. I gasped and held back tears.

I then heard the front door open and slam shut. I heard keys jingle. Heavy footsteps walked down the hall towards me.

I went to the window and found bars outside it. I didn’t remember seeing any bars on Jerry’s windows.   

I turned to Jerry’s bathroom and tiptoed in. I closed the bathroom door behind me. I listened to the footsteps entering the bedroom. I realized that there was another door next to me. I opened it and 
scurried into another bedroom. 

I heard the bathroom door open behind me. The man was following me.
I then hurried out that room and back into the hallway. I sprinted to the front door. 

Over my shoulder, I could sense him chasing me. 

I got to the front door and tried to open it. But that’s when I realized there was a lock on the door that was reversed, and you needed a key to get out. 

The man grabbed me and flung me to the floor. He was dressed in all black and wore a creepy demon mask. 

He stood there for a moment. He didn’t have any weapons. I waved my knife at him and screamed for him to stay the f away from me.

I asked him why he was doing this and he didn’t answer.

He then lunged at me. I tried to slash him, but he blocked me and hit me in the face. He slammed my hand into a dresser and I dropped the knife. He then started choking me. I tried to fight back, kicking him and screaming into his ears. But his hands wrapped around my neck. And he was incredibly powerful.

He used his elbows and knees to block and kick me.

I knew I couldn’t win. Something clicked inside me: I needed to play dead. I stopped fighting. I then let my body go limp. And thankfully he underestimated my resolve. After I stopped fighting, he choked me a little longer but then let go and let my body fall to the floor. 

At that moment, I was barely conscious. I had to cough but I held it in. I knew if I coughed or breathed too loudly, I would be done for. My body kicked into protection mode and shut it down. I slowly controlled my breathing, even though my lungs burned so badly.

I lay there listening to see what the man was going to do. 

I knew that my knife was nearby. 

I knew I only had one chance. In a quick bolt I got up, grabbed the knife and rushed him with everything I had left. His back was to me and he seemed to be getting something out of a bag. He turned, surprised, and tried to twist away. But I became a human spear and ran my knife into him. It landed in his side. All the way in. We fell over and I quickly rolled away and pulled out the knife. 

As he writhed around in pain, I got up and saw him – it was the man from the coffee shop. I ran to the backdoor in the kitchen. It also had a reverse lock on it. But it had a window as well. I then picked up a kitchen chair and used it to smash through the window. 

I then quickly climbed out.

I ran down the street as far as I could. After some time, I got to the nearest gas station which was open. I was bloody, bruised, and had no shoes. The attendant called the cops. Once they arrived, I told them everything.

The cops didn’t find the man at Jerry’s house. They also didn’t find Jerry’s body. They never did. I told them about my encounter at Starbucks. They got Starbuck’s surveillance video. But even with his blood and picture, they didn’t know who the man was – and even if the encounter was connected.

I knew they were connected. 

They never found the man. 

My car was discovered a few blocks over. Its ignition was hotwired. They think he used some kind of device to block my cell phone signal from working.

I moved out of my house and put it up for sale. I’ve been staying with friends, never staying in the same place for too long, and seeing a therapist. I have nightmares every night.
 
I realized what a naïve life I had lived.

About a month ago, I saw on the news that a girl was murdered, and they found her in a neighbor’s house. They were looking for the neighbor and suspected the neighbor of the killing. Some of the locks on the door were reversed.

It’s been a few weeks now and they haven’t found the neighbor. I don’t think they ever will. I feel so sorry for Jerry.

I’m seriously thinking of changing my name now and moving to another state on the other side of the country. Wouldn’t you?
