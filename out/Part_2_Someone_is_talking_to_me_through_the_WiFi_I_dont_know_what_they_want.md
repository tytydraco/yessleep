[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oc0ked/someone_is_talking_to_me_through_the_wifi_i_dont/)

It’s been a little while since my last post, and so much has happened that I completely forgot to share an update.

To be honest, I didn’t expect such a response here. While this has been frightening (and the latest events even more so), I’m almost touched that other people care. 

I’m writing this from a motel room. As you’ll read, we moved out (and in a hurry), but I’m not sure how much that will help us. For now, though, we’re safe.

My last post left off with my wife, Ashley, heading to work after an uneventful Monday at home. To my relief and disappointment, there were no glitches with the Wi-Fi or messages passed via network names.

Believe me, I spent the entire weekend checking my phone for new networks, but nothing showed. Ashley still believed me, but I knew there was an undercurrent of doubt (with a tinge of concern and suspicion) underneath. It’s fair, after all. I had no proof; just my word. 

Despite the radio silence over the weekend, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried. 

I still hoped this was a harmless prank from a neighborhood kid, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't be.

It didn’t help that I barely slept a wink all weekend. 

I’ve been having a recurring nightmare recently – it started up a few weeks ago – where I’m being chased. The circumstances of the dream change, but the core is always the same: I’m frantically packing a suitcase because someone is coming for me. By the time I finish packing and look out the window, it’s too late: they’ve arrived. Sometimes they come in a black car. Once, it was a helicopter circling my home. And another time it was a dark figure with no face. Either way, I never see who it is before I’m jolted awake.

Brought on by the recent events, no doubt.

After dropping Ashley off at the train in the morning and a quick kiss goodbye, I faced two options: go home and let all this start up again, or see if I could prolong my time out of the house. 

I chose the latter. I brought my laptop and headphones with me and posted up at a coffee shop. It was fine, but between the frustrated glances of other patrons during my web calls and the nagging feeling that I couldn’t stay out of the house forever, I realized I needed to leave.

As I drove home, I mulled over the potential causes for my situation:

The rational response is a carbon monoxide leak, causing me to imagine the whole thing. This is doubtful given that Ashley is home four days a week and shows no side effects. 

Ditto with some form of psychotic break. I’m too old for the onset of schizophrenia, and Ashley would have noticed odd behavior well before this if I showed signs. 

Therefore, this must really be happening to me. Which is oddly comforting in a way, but it opens up the more sinister possibilities.

Could there be someone hiding in the neighborhood or around the house? That’s possible. But whoever it is, they must be fast; otherwise, I’d see them. And they’ve had an uncanny ability to know exactly where I am and what I’m doing to time the Wi-Fi going out with the moment I step through the front door. 

Could this be a supernatural phenomenon? Some sort of… poltergeist or something? I don’t exactly believe in ghosts, but the thought of someone, or something, haunting me while I was in that house all alone sent a chill down my spine and raised the hairs on the back of my neck. 

Driving down the street with the autumn sunshine filtering through the yellow and orange leaves, it was hard to be grim.

Until I pulled in front of the house. Everything looked normal at first, then I noticed that the light in my home office was on. 

I ran through my memory of the morning, trying to recollect whether I had even turned the light on in my office, but my mind came up blank. Surely Ashley would have noticed; she’s conscious of these things.

My legs felt as though they were made of lead as I stepped out of the parked car and stood in the driveway. I took a deep breath of the cold, damp air and made my way, step by step, to the front door and, with a clammy hand, turned the knob and walked into the house.

Sure enough, our thermostat was blinking its warning that the Wi-Fi was out.

My home office is just down the hall, but by the time I made it to the doorway, it was as if I had run a mile. I was panting, and sweat streamed down my back. My hands trembled as I unplugged and plugged the router back in and checked the networks. 

There were two new ones: “I missed you this morning” and “Left the light on for you ;)”

I had the wherewithal to grab a screenshot (thanks for the tip!) and then dialed 911. 

“911, what’s your name, location, and emergency?”

“My name is Tyler, and I live at 31 Appleton Road. I’d like to report a burglary.”

“Are you safe, sir? Is the suspect still there?”

“I don’t know. I mean, yes, I’m safe. I came home, and a light was left on and…” I trailed off, unsure of what to say next.

“Was anything taken from your house?”

“I don’t know.” I thought for a moment, “No, nothing that I can see.”

“Did you, or do you, see or hear anyone in your house?”

“No.”

“Are there any signs of forced entry? Open windows, broken locks…”

“No.”

“But you said a light was left on?”

“Yes. But I swear I didn’t leave it on when I left the house this morning. There’s something going on with my Wi-Fi networks, and someone keeps leaving messages for me, and they told me through the Wi-Fi that they left the light on.”

“Right. Sir, I’m going to transfer you to our psychiatric unit. Please hold.”

I hung up the phone and went numb. I know that I’m not imagining this or deluding myself. Someone – or something – is watching me. And they were inside my house.

I grabbed my bag and left. As I turned back to glance at the locked house, sitting as it did just five minutes prior and hours before when I left it, silent and inviting, I looked around at the empty street with not even a car driving past. 

I shuddered in the damp air and hopped into the driver’s seat of the car and drove back to the coffee shop, where I spent the rest of the day, other patrons be damned. I have a lot to explain to Ashley when I pick her up later. Not the least of which is the $700 security camera system I bought on Amazon.

“You called the cops?” 

That was Ashley’s first question after I told her about my day.

“I panicked. The light was on, and *they* told me they did it. I didn’t know what else to do. And before you call me crazy, look, I have proof.” I showed her the screenshot of the Wi-Fi network names.

Ashley looked, pursing her lips, and then looked up at me. “This is seriously freaky shit. What do we do now?”

I told her about the security system I had bought and that the next time we call the police, we’ll have documented evidence to share. 

Despite my nervousness, I fell asleep quickly that night. But the dream came back and woke me up. Based on Ashley’s tossing and turning, I doubt she slept much either. 

The next morning, over her cup of coffee, Ashley looked hard at me. “Why don’t you come to Boston with me today? You can post up in my office somewhere, or work from the library if you want your own space.” 

Looking around our living room and imagining coming through it alone to find the Wi-Fi out again, I agreed, and we were off.

I enjoy working from home, but man, it’s nice sometimes to feel like I’m *going* to work. There’s nothing like being in Boston during autumn; the air is crisp and clear, the leaves in the Common are a blaze of orange, red, and yellow, and there are hints of the holidays around the corner. 

Despite the circumstances, it was a great day; I was even optimistic about catching whoever this is once we install the security system. Or at least having enough information for the police to take us seriously.

Then the shit really hit the fan, which is what brought us both to the Motel 6 three towns over. 

I had received an email earlier in the day that our security system was delivered that afternoon. As we drove up to our house, not only was the package *not* there, but my office light was left on again. 

We sprinted out of the car and into the house, and saw that the Wi-Fi was out. Ashley checked the Wi-Fi networks and showed me two new messages:

“You shouldn’t have done that.” And, “Don’t worry, you’ll see me soon enough.”

We threw jeans, shirts, toothbrushes, and other essentials into our backpacks and ran for the car, and here we are. I don’t know what we’re going to do next, or how long this will go on. But I know this: our home isn’t safe anymore.
