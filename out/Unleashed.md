I sat hunched, my arms crossed and resting atop the kitchen table. The kitchen was a shithole; the whole house was a shithole, an ugly beige droplet in a sea of green blades peppered with frost. I was living in a run-down two-bedroom mobile home, in the middle of nowhere out in a barren grass plain. 

No matter how much of a neat freak my mother was the interior of our residence always remained dilapidated and hideous. You wouldn’t have to look for long to find splotches of dirt and black mold lining the walls- splotches that never seemed to go away no matter how much scrubbing my mother made me do. 

My mother stood in front of me beside a pile of dirty dishes and a stain of dry rot that seeped into the wood panel wall of our kitchen. I was looking up at her, my gaze shooting from under my browline and my head tilted forward. A slight frown twisted my face, peeking through the sheets of long black hair that drooped down off each side of my long narrow chin- a facial deformity my mother never failed to bring up.  

Her arms were akimbo and she wore a scornful scowl. Staring intently I saw the wrinkles of a woman worked to the bone. Years of single parenting and long shifts as an ER nurse had aged her well beyond her thirty-four years. 

“She’s a hag.” ,I thought to myself, “I’m alone here with an old worthless bitch.”, and we really were alone. My mother had me pulled out of public school at the age of seven after frequent complaints of behavioral problems from my teachers. This left me homeschooled and isolated for the majority of my life, I had no friends and there was absolutely no chance I’d get to see any of my relatives. 

The disdain my mother felt towards me had only increased over the years, sky rocketing as I hit puberty. I had always bore a striking similarity to my mothers father. The resemblance grew with age. She hated her father, she hated that I was becoming a constant reminder of all he did to her. She couldn’t stand the sight of me. “ You have his eyes; eyes of a soulless man, a soulless boy.” 

She was wearing black sweatpants and a teal blue tank top. As I looked at her I saw the loose skin on her arms sagging, almost like it was being pulled down towards the floor. 

“This sink is disgusting. You’ve seriously walked by this thing and didn’t think to clean it *once?!*” 

Her tone was authoritative. She spoke like a drill sergeant, demanding respect and obedience.

This was nothing new, bickering came from her in constant waves of nuisance. The dish washing must’ve gotten lost somewhere in the eight hours of school work followed by an hour of house cleaning followed by two hours of yard work.

I said nothing, I just kept staring at her, seething. 

“What Matt? What?! You have somethin to say for yourself?! Whatchu lookin so mean for?!” 

I kept staring, my mouth now open and revealing my teeth, gritting side to side. 

Her face softened, she smirked and scoffed loudly, “What, you think this is bad? You think I’m some sorta *horrible* mother just cause I ask you to do some chores? You really think you got it bad Matt?!” 

My eyes never left her, they had become wider, more expressive with my rage. 	

For a long moment we stayed locked in place, staring at each other silently. The smirk from her face quickly faded and her eyes slowly started to spark a flame that matched my own. 

“That’s *fucking PITIFUL*!”, she howled the last word for emphasis. Her statement shattered the silence and rang through my ears. 

“You are nothing but a fucking ungrateful little brat! You don’t even know *half* the fucking shit I do for you! Do you actually think about what *I* have to go through havin to put up with your shit?! Clearly you don’t, if you did then *maybe* you’d show me a little fucking respect! *Maybe* I *wouldn’t* regret not killing you when I had the fucking chance!”

This is something she droned on about constantly, she never wanted me, to her I was nothing but the unfortunate result of a forceful act of sin.

She continued, “Or maybe I still would! You probably already know what I do for you, and you just don’t care! You just wanna be a little pain in my ass because that’s all you can be, all you’ll ever be.” 

Her final remark wasn’t spilled as some sort of emotional vent, she said like it was nothing more than a fact. 

Throughout that entire tirade the veins in her necks bulged out like worms trying to exit from beneath her skin. As I watched the words bleed from her all I could think about was popping those worms like zits as I squeezed the life out of her. 

I thought about my hands wrapping around her throat. I thought about the feeling of her rough skin as I pressed into her windpipe. I thought about her face growing into an ugly red blister as she struggled to breathe. I thought about her eyes welding with tears and bulging out of her head, I thought about them getting crossed and eventually losing the spark they exhibited until they became dull and empty. 

I thought about all of this as I sat on my wood chair, staring at my mother, wide-eyed and breathing loudly through my nose.

With her final remark came a stillness that was felt between the both of us. We watched each other, waiting for someone to finally act and break the rest segment of the cacophony found ourselves in. She had her chance to berate me with all the harrowing thoughts of a woman filled with hatred of the hand life dealt her, now it was my turn. 

I quickly rose, upending the table as I did so. The fruit bowl flew off, sending a bunch of apples and pears towards her. As the table fell forward the chair she stood behind fell back, pressing her into the kitchen drawer behind her. To add to this the table was now on its side and pushing her even further in.

I stood, fists balled and slightly hunched, looming over her. 

“You goddamn fucking bitch, who the *fuck* do you think you’re talking to?! You think you deserve *any* fucking respect?! You’re just a bitch mom who can’t shut her mouth! All you do is WHINE and CRY and SCREAM my FUCKING HEAD OFF! You think *I'm* lucky to be alive?!”

I glanced at the knife storage block on the counter. The yellow light pouring from the dim lamp above reflected off the surface of the steel blades. They shined bright like angels, calling to me in sweet hymns. 

I turned back to her, my voice dropped, “You really think that?”

If I had been just a few years younger and smaller my mother would have pushed that table off her and spanked me till my ass was purple, but I wasn’t. Meeting my mother’s gaze, I peered into her mind and what was writhing within it, something I had only ever seen as I got older: fear. She had been more anxious in my presence in recent years and this act of rebellion seemed to put the fear of God in her.  

Her mouth hung open, a wide chasm sounding in and out long gusts of wind. Tears flowed down her cheeks as her nose reddened. “M-M-Matt please, calm down.” The words were spoken soft and raspy; the screaming she did must’ve taken her voice. 

Her hands were raised and facing me, they were held only a couple of inches away from her chest, trembling. 

I grabbed a long kitchen knife from the block stand. I stopped gritting my teeth, I was now breathing out my mouth, stomach heaving. I had been thinking about doing this since I was in preschool. Years of resentment were culminating into an act of irredeemable justice, I was nervous. 

“Matt-”, this was all she said before I lunged at her. She tried pushing off the table and running but I grabbed a thick clump of her hair before she could. Her hands reached out to hold me back but I had *her* held firmly in place. I raised my knife and plunged it deep into the side of her neck. The noise she released was something between a gag and a gurgle. I was looking into her eyes as I did it, they winced and she looked at me like I was inhuman, like she didn’t understand who or what I was. She looked confused, scared of the unknown I had become to her. 

I pulled out the knife and an eruption of blood roared out of the geyser it had left in her neck. My breathing was stifled, I couldn’t believe what I had just done. She was still alive, breathing, gurgling. I slowly raised my knife back up, left hand still attached to the clump of hair it latched to. I ran the knife into her, again and again, each thrust slow, releasing a wet thud as it tore through her flesh. Blood poured from her neck like hot lava out a volcano, I kept stabbing her until I stopped hearing anything from her. 

I looked long and hard at her, she was dead. Seventeen years spent living with my mother had gotten me here, covered in her blood, now standing in it as it seeped from under the table. 

A long huff left my lungs involuntarily, its sound shook and quaked as it stung through my drying throat. 

My legs wouldn’t carry me, clinging me to where I stood like two pillars of concrete molded to the floor. 

The only movements I made were the heaves of my body as I hyperventilated. I was still hunched, my arms laid limply by my sides, my right hand holding the knife, droplets of blood rhythmically falling from its edge to the pool of it around my feet. 

*splat…splat..splat…* The hungry pool swallowed the droplets up as they crashed into it, the sounds of the feast echoed far throughout my home now muted of noise, muted of essence. 

*Thump, Thump, Thump, Thump, Thump, Thump, Thump…* A flood of shock washed over me as I jumped out of my skin. It was the screen door, someone had pounded on it in a melody that rose and fell like a wave. 

My head shot left to face the living room. I couldn’t even venture a guess as to who was outside. The window on the top half of the screen door was fogged from the frigid weather outside and all I could see was what looked to be a male figure standing at my height. 

Directly next to my door was a window I could use to see who had shown up without being seen by him as I was drenched in my mother’s blood.

I crept slowly to the window, the carpet of my living room squished softly as the blood from my boots ran through it, each step I took left a crimson imprint of my soles. 

I leaned down, opened the curtains, and swiped the side of my wrist across the window to clear the fog.

One second. One second would be all it took to process what peered at me through that window. One second that will remain engraved in my mind like hieroglyphs carved into ancient tablets, never leaving after epochs of wear.   

It was an eyesore taking the appearance of a dog and the appearance of a human being. It was as if someone had hot glued strips of flabby skin to a hound; its limbs were too long for a dog as well, more developed.

It was crouched down and I was meeting it at eye level. The sides of each of its hands were formed in crescent shapes that met together and created a half circle. The shape was crossed above its brow, shading its face from the sun as it stared through the glass barrier. The skin in between its fingers were connected leaving them looking like webbed paws. One long thumb jutted out of the sides of each of its wrists and towards its face. A sixth stub that resembled a wide pinky poked out of each of its lower forearms, surrounded by short strands of hair. 

The shade of its hands shadowed its features, shadowed its snout. The snout was a long narrow cone stretched with full lips- formed into a long frown- and a discolored red patch of skin that surrounded its nostrils. The skin that covered its snout wrinkled and sagged in two long stretches all the way down to its neck, the two stretches formed a crease that went down in between them. The flaps of skin around the crease were like labia folds layered around a vaginal opening. 

The only things on its face that resembled the characteristics of a human being were the round dark brown eyes it sized me up with, doing so through black drapes of hair that reached just below its snout.  

It knew that I was appalled by the sight of it. If it didn’t see the terror on my face then it was surely sensing it; I realized this as soon as its eyes widened and its mouth opened, revealing its bared teeth; if you could even call them that.

Sharp steel blade tips stuck out of its gums, each one different in length and width. Some of them were serrated, some were double-edged, all turned counterclockwise as if they were hot meals of metal being presented on a rotating plate, hoping to draw me in as *they* ready to take a bite. 

As it bore its teeth It growled, its tone was raspy and its sound bubbled deep from its throat. Its voice was not that of a beast, not that of a dog; Its voice was human, a man's mockery of an aggro canine.  

*Thump, Thump, Thump, Thump, Thump, Thump, Thump…* It turned its head to the door, as it did I could see long floppy droops of skin jiggle off the sides of its head. 

After about five seconds I heard a whistle from the male figure. With that it turned its body, knelt down, and started to crawl on all fours towards the source of the call. 

“Woof, Woof, Woof-Woof!*”,* it was almost comical how forced it sounded, there wasn’t even an attempt to sound like a dog at this point. 

I could see it rise in front of the male figure. It was slouched and stood like a bipedal primate. It lifted its head and rammed the top of it straight into the screen window. The retort was deafening. Glass rained and fell silently onto the carpet. 

It stood there panting, its tongue bounced; a long strip of pink meat dripping with swabs of drool. Its hands were pressed into the bottom of the screen window lined with glass that poked into its palms, sending red streams trickling down the white vinyl door. Its face was not winced, not pained, not bitter; its face was exuberant with joy, it wanted me. Its eyes met mine like I was all that mattered and all it ever wanted, all that it’d ever want. 

It was fitted with a collar that ran tight around the top of his head, it connected to a leash just out of view. The collar was fleshy and rotten; swamp green and dirt brown; riddled with maggots coiling around the rope of decay, it stank like roadkill baked under summer heat. 

The leash was pulled back sending its wearer stumbling backward, whimpering in monotone. As the whimpering thing fell back the male figure walked forward.

His hair was black and gray, parted down the middle and ending just below his jawline. Calling his skin unnatural would be an understatement. It was hung over him like an oversized full-body costume. He had blank hollow holes in place of round eyes and a frowning mouth; holes cut out of his head like a jack-o’-lantern. Hoards of flies swarmed in and out of each hole, a roaring buzz emanated from inside him. 

He wore a white dress shirt with blue stripes, the sleeves of it rolled up below his biceps-

I saw this as he walked towards the window, put his hairy right arm through it, and unlocked the door. 

This all went through my mind in about two seconds. I had observed and assessed every detail of the man standing in front of me, at least I thought he had. Despite all I was already seeing, the man still had one thing left to show me. He raised his left hand, bringing it to the side of his face. He was using it to hold the leash; no… the leash was inside him. It split out of his palm like a hospital tube flowing a feed of maggots and rot to the collar that held his pooch. 

*CREEEAAAK…* He pushed the door open slowly, holding it open with his foot. The dog thing moved forward to his left, the vine of putrid meat that bound it swung up and down as it went. Its eyes were no longer eager to meet mine, they were now poised towards its owner. They were puppy dog eyes, beckoning him. 

Hesitantly I looked back up to gaze into the man's empty sockets. His head was tilted down towards the leash in his palm. Out of the mouth hole of his costume came decaying yellow teeth hung from soot black gums- the gums were more weaves of muscle fiber stringing together to make bed for the top and bottom rows. The teeth came out of the hollow mouth like dentures as they made their way towards the leash. After a few seconds of pushing the two front teeth along with a couple of incisors landed at their destination.

*C-CRUNCH!*, like a rosebud being snipped from its stem. The man turned and walked away, his vine of maggots fell limp to the floor. The hound was unleashed.

A bullet, a bullet aimed straight for my throat is probably the best comparison I could give as to how quickly this thing moved towards me. 

It had toppled forwards and started running to me on all fours. As it ran in the light of my home its full body was revealed to me. It was fat and naked. Folds of skin hung over it head to toe, if you could even call them toes. Its feet took the appearance of its hands, appendages melded together to create something more l webbed paws and a big toe jutting out from both behind and to the sides of each of its calves- facing inward. Looking at its chest I saw huge flaps that sagged, a brown spot akin to a birthmark rested where its nipples should have been. Looking at its whole abdomen made me realize that insects were crawling under its skin, pressed against it and threatening to burst out of it.

I hardly had time to come up with an apt description of it in my head as it sped forward. I raised both my hands, left arm crossed and out in front of my throat, right hand clenched to my chest. Its panting grew closer and closer until it stood upright with its hands hung limply against it like it was begging for a treat. It raised its long snout and bit into my forearm. Hot burning pain blazed through my entire body as it latched on, pushing me backward and into the wall. Its teeth twisted and turned and I could feel them drill into me, digging through tissue like it was nothing but pulsing soil.

In my right hand I was still clenching the knife I used to slaughter my mother, still dripping with her blood. Its use wasn’t over. 

My knife rose and plummeted deep within the thing’s neck. It let out something of a leaky howl. I took the knife out and it fell backward, as it did it let go of my arm letting loose fountains of blood to flow to the carpet. 

My assailant fell in front of me, laid on its side between the soft carpet and the hardwood floor of my kitchen, holding its neck and bubbling gurgled whimpers with each breath. I walked to it on weak legs and turned it over. Kneeling, I split its arms to its sides and plunged my knife repeatedly into the front of its neck; both hands on the handle, swing after swing.

The sagging vagina-like folds on its neck opened to reveal the inner workings of its esophagus, bleeding like it was on a heavy menstrual cycle. 

It stopped whimpering after the first crash of my blade but I didn’t stop, plunge after plunge, wound after wound, until I started whimpering; labored yelps of fear and exhaustion. 

I stood over it, huffing and puffing as my lungs burned; watching the blood run from its neck. Something small and yellow wormed out of its neck hole, coming down from its head, trailed by a small tube of rotting meat. It didn’t take long for me to realize that whatever was coming out of this thing's neck was the same thing that held its head in place just a few moments ago.

As seconds passed more and more of the tubing pooled out like tape leaving a broken cassette. It inched its way to my left, leaving a slick stream of slime from under it and closing the distance between it and the red pool my mother stood in.  

As I turned to my mother I saw that the skin around her neck was crawling with maggots, I saw that she had her very own tube pulling itself to unite with the one heading her way. They came closer and closer until they finally met each other's embrace, becoming one long cord strung across my line of sight.

*Shloop-BA!* The tube shot forward, coiling and contorting straight into the deep craters on my arm. I felt it tear through my bones, my muscles, and my nerve endings; everything I have in me; heading straight for my brain.

It has nearly been twenty-three hours since this happened. 

I can feel bugs squirming under my skin and flowing tubes draped through my body, pushing to act as a second nervous system. 

A tsunami of sick and deranged thoughts are crashing through my mind and a floodgate of my own split conscience is holding them back from seeping to my neurons, refusing to let me act on them no matter how much a part of me aches to do so. 

Two options are bouncing through my head like pinballs. 

On one hand is a grueling refusal to open the floodgate. It’d be like starving, like being parched under a bright desert sun; that is unless I try to cut this thing out of me, try to stop it from spreading to anyone else. That’d be painful too, and with how it's run through my body my knife will surely have reaped its user before I'll even see the thing fully leave my body. 

On the other hand, I could give in to the overbearing temptation. Morally the things I’d be doing would be twisted enough to make the devil blush a brighter shade of red than the stains littered throughout my home; speaking of which my hands are already dirty, I have two corpses laid in my wake to show for that. This option would also no doubt be an easier and even more pleasurable experience compared to the former. 

Regardless of whichever I choose I can be assured of one thing; someone will be left hurting.
