Thank you so much for responding to my questions! Now I’m one hundred percent sure that [my mom's way of grounding me](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ykly6d/hey_quick_question_how_do_your_parents_ground_you/) is not normal. I’ve also learned a LOT from the comments people made on the last post, and a lot of people had questions for me after I posted it. According to what you guys said, there’s more that’s unusual about me than just the way I get grounded, so I’m going to go more into detail about the stuff you guys were confused about. Can you guys tell me if any of this is normal?

I mentioned that I didn’t have a dad. Or at least, I’ve never met my dad. As far back as I can remember, it’s just been me and my mom, and I haven’t seen any pictures or videos of him, but my mom has mentioned him before. She doesn’t talk about him a lot, but apparently he left months before I was born. My mom says he wanted a son, and when he found out I was a girl he just walked out. They both worked for the same company my mom works at now, and I think he still works there too, so I might be able to find out who he is? It’ll be hard without knowing his name though.

Some people also wondered if my mom has the same abilities I do. I don't know if she does or not. I thought everyone had them, so I’ve never asked her about it. I’ve never seen her do any of the things I can do though, and when she broke her wrist it took her three months to heal, and it only takes me ten minutes, so I guess that means if she has my abilities, she recovers much slower than I do.

I’m only put in the box when I’m grounded. Most of the time, when I’m doing things that (apparently) only I can do, I actually get rewarded for doing it. My mom calls them lessons, and says everyone has to take them, but I’m pretty sure that’s a lie now.

My first lesson started the day after my third birthday. My mom sat me down and said now that I’d turned three I had to start doing lessons now. I was really excited when she said I was going to start them, because she told me they were super important.

I was a little less excited when she took out an exacto knife, and told me to put my hand on the table. But I did what she told me to. Then, before I could pull my hand away, she took the knife, and slashed it across my pinky finger.

I cried and screamed, even after the gash had fully healed. My mom sighed.

“I guess that’s where we’re stopping today. Here’s your reward, sweetie.”

She handed me a king-size Snickers bar. I’d never been allowed to have a candy bar that big before, and the excitement instantly made me stop crying.

“Can I have it right now, or do I have to wait until after dinner?”

“It’s your choice. Eat it whenever you want. You’ll get another one if you do your lessons tomorrow.”

“Really?!”

“Yes. You deserve it after working so hard. And once you complete harder lessons, you’ll get an even bigger reward.”

“Like what?”

“I’ll take you to Toys R us or Target and let you pick out any toy you want. If you complete a really hard lesson, I’ll let you get even more toys.”

I started looking forward to my lessons after that. Even though things could sometimes get *really* scary, and hurt a lot, the reward I got at the end was worth it to me.

The lessons would always start small, and build up from there. Every day, she’d cut my pinky finger just a little bit deeper. After a month, she got a bigger blade, and cut the tip of my finger off. This, I learned, was the “harder” lesson my mom was talking about.

After three months, she could cut the whole finger off, and it would barely even hurt. Then we moved on to my ring finger, and the cycle would start all over again until I was used to having that finger cut off too. Eventually, I could chop all of them off without breaking a sweat.

One of my mom’s coworkers has a kid around my age, and when I went to her birthday party that year, my mom told me to show all her work friends the stuff I could do. They loved it, and told me I’m doing amazing at my lessons.

I’ve shown a lot of the stuff I can do to my mom’s work friends over the years. That’s one of the reasons I thought everyone could do them, because they didn't act like it was super unusual.

When I turned seven, the lessons got even more difficult. This is when I started with the kind of stuff that makes me black out. (Or, according to you guys, possibly “die?”)

It started with things that didn’t really hurt. I’d get a needle of something injected into my arm, and then I’d just have to sit there and wait until I blacked out. Then we moved on to the gun, the falls, the knife, the car…I’ve done so many lessons it’s hard to keep track of them all, but the most painful ones by far have been the incinerator and the hydraulic press. It took me a really long time to finish those lessons, but I got an American Girl doll and my computer as rewards for finally finishing them, so that was nice.

The voices I hear sound different when I’m not put in the box. I don’t become them, but I still hear them. Most of the time they don’t repeat themselves over and over again, actually, they talk normally, but it’s mostly amongst themselves. I don’t think they even notice that I’m there. Also when I wake up, I wake up in my bed instead of the box. My mom always moves me there after I've finished my lessons.

There’s only been one time where I’ve blacked out that wasn’t because I was grounded or for a lesson. That was the only time I’ve woken up afterwards in a place that wasn’t the box or my bed. When I was eight, I went downstairs to get a glass of water in the middle of the night, and I fell down the stairs and hit my head really hard. I woke up at the bottom of the staircase with a huge gash in my head. It fixed itself a few minutes afterward. I shrugged it off and went back to bed. I never told anyone, and I don't think my mom found out, either.

A lot of you guys wanted me to ask my mom some questions to learn more, but I haven’t asked my Mom any questions yet, because I’m worried she’ll get suspicious, so I tried to find out as much as I could on my own.

I know she’s a scientist, but I wasn’t sure what kind, so I decided to look up the building she works at, and I found out that the staff is mostly made up of biologists and chemists, so I’m assuming she’s one of those.

I went into my mom’s room when she was busy, pretending I was looking for a homework assignment I’d lost, and I found my birth certificate and a bunch of other stuff in a folder in my mom’s room.

My birth certificate didn’t tell me a whole lot, but it did confirm that my mom is my actual mom, since some people were worried she wasn't. I didn’t find my dad’s name on it, unfortunately.

The next paper in the folder was my social security number, which I’m pretty sure you shouldn’t share on the internet, so I’m not going to. There were also a bunch of insurance papers, but I didn’t find anything useful on them.

I was about to put the folder back when I saw there was a flash drive in the other pocket. I plugged it into my laptop to see if anything was on it, and I found two videos.

The first video was of me, demonstrating some of my tricks in front of my mom’s work friends. Then it cut to a boy doing similar tricks in front of similarly dressed people, but the building looked different than the one my mom works at. There were ten or so different kids in the video, some looked older than me, some younger. The video quality also switched from looking really good to super grainy at times.

I’ve never met any of these kids, but they all could do the same things I can do. What was concerning is that most of them were crying and screaming. Most of their parents had to hold them down, but I was calm enough to hold the knife myself for the demonstration.

I don’t understand. These kids are clearly special like I am, so why do they look like they’re in so much pain? Aren’t they used to it by now?

The other video was of a room that looks like a doctor’s office. There were three metal tables sitting next to each other. One had a skeleton on it, one had a bunch of gross bloody stuff laid vaguely out in the shape of a person, and one had a heart, eyes, and a bunch of grey stuff smeared around the table.

*Is this what happens to people that don’t come back?*

Then, I noticed some of the gross bloody stuff was moving slightly. Maybe it was re-forming?

I kept watching, but it didn’t. It just kept moving in the same slight, repetitive fashion.

And then, I realized what was happening.

*It was breathing.*

And as soon as I came to that realization, the video ended.

Now, I could have re-watched it to try and make more sense of it, but it made my stomach turn, so I put it away.

How much of this stuff is normal? Is any of it normal? Should I try to talk to my mom??? I have no clue what to do about this. Do you guys have any advice?
