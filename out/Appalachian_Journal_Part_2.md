\[Sorry for the extended absence. I’ve been doing a lot of research, a lot of driving, and a lot of hiking. I think I have a general idea of where all this may occurred, but by general… I mean *very* general. I showed this second chapter early to some fellow hikers, and one of them told me that he thinks they’re situated somewhere west of the Eastern Continental Divide due to some of the details here. He sounded sure about it, at least, and after doing some of my own research to verify, it seemed as good a lead as any. 

My search led me to West Virginia first. That’s where I’ve been situated the last month, but… as you can imagine from my unenthusiastic tone, I haven’t turned up anything new. I’ve read ahead, trying to learn more about the town the writer keeps mentioning, and while they have quite a lot to say about it, none of it involves actually naming the damn place. 

Correction. They do *seem* to name it, however, every single instance I can find where they likely dropped the name of it is… blurry. Have you ever tried using a pencil eraser on pen ink? It’s smudged a lot like that. So, while I was hoping whatever this town is would be a sure ticket to getting answers, I am, to put it bluntly, shit out of luck in that regard. So, it’s been a lot of studying maps, following trails, bodies of water… it’s been exhausting. I’m not giving up, but hopefully, you can understand my slowness in updating you all. I’m juggling a lot here, and it’s been proving very difficult. 

That being said, you’ve heard quite enough of my complaining. Here’s the next entry.\]



# June 1st



The forest had been quieter than ever; after everything that had happened the other night, it felt wrong. I was keeping myself up at night waiting for something *else* to happen. The irony isn't lost on me. One night, the sounds of the forest keep me on edge. The next, its absence sends me spiraling.

It was the feeling you get from the silence of an approaching storm. You see the black clouds overhead, and know what's coming next. So why can't the soundtrack of the Earth reflect the way you feel? It felt odd waking up to sunlight warming my face. I expected rain on the window, or a menacing fog rolling in.

No such thing. A bright day, with a gentle breeze. Cicadas chirping together in a buzzing orchestration, the shuffling leaves and creaking branches of the trees serving as their accompaniment. The world just was what it was. Didn't matter how I felt about it.

I got up slowly, rubbing the sand from my eyes and blinking blearily at the sunbeams invading my uncle's bedroom. As I looked around, I took in the decorations that adorned it. Cork-boards lined the walls with prized wilderness photos, complete with detailed notes, GPS coordinates, and corresponding entries in some of his nature books. It confused me the more I thought about it. My uncle had to have all this info memorized by heart by now, barring *maybe* the locations of where he took the pictures. Even that felt like something he’d just know off the top of his head, though. I couldn’t help but wonder what all this additional information was for.

Too tired to analyze any further or study them myself, I dragged myself into the kitchen, cooking up a mediocre breakfast. I'm slowly getting better at the whole "cooking" thing, but it takes so much more effort than my college diet of instant noodles and energy drinks. I put special effort into making it that morning since I knew I'd need a lot of energy to get through the day. Even then, I still underestimated how much I'd need it.

The plan was simple enough: gear up, and start mapping out the forest. I packed a big hiking back full of everything I thought I needed. Plenty of snacks and water, of course. Maps, GPS, and other survival supplies like a knife and bear mace. There was no "over-preparing" in my eyes. I got used to how the GPS worked, as well as my starting position on the maps. Learning to read and understand the maps fully was an arduous process, but my mom had already run me through a crash course of her own while she was here. Through my studies of the maps for the surrounding areas, I learned there was a cave about three miles from the house. That didn't sound that far. At least, not as someone who used to drive about five times that every day between college, to work, to home. I drew an approximate route to follow there and back.

Eventually, I caught myself septuple-checking my bag and everything on me. What was initially me just “over-preparing”, became a revolving door of compulsive check-listing to stall; it was clear after a while I was simply putting off going on the trek. I took a deep breath, muttered some iffy self-reassurances, and finally walked out the door. The air outside was crisp and inviting, the breeze carrying with it the inviting scents of nature's bounty. As much as I wanted to enjoy it, I couldn't forget what had happened the other night. It colored my perception of what would normally be a calming experience for anyone else. I started to wonder if it was a front; if even now I was being lured into some trap.

That being said, locking myself in the house until it was time to go home wasn't going to get me anywhere. I didn't want to be just… me, anymore. I wanted to come out of all of this a better person, someone I could be proud of. Not to mention, I still had so many questions about my uncle that were plaguing my mind. I'd never get them answered by aimlessly letting the days pass me by.

The first step into the forest was the hardest. It felt like crossing a threshold into a whole new world. The further I tread, the easier it became; but I struggled not to cast backward glances to the safety of the house. Steeling my resolve, I pushed forward. It was still early in the day. The morning sun scattered through the canopy overhead, warming my skin and the cool dirt beneath my feet. Each step was cushioned and almost springy from the moss growing along the brown soil. The air was fresh and crisp from the scent of morning dew, the tall grass sparkling like diamonds as the light touched it.. A soothing melody greeted me as I pushed on, songbirds playfully darting between the trees.

I tried to isolate all these different sensations, feeling my heart calm as I tucked them all away in a mental scrapbook. Seeing the forest like this, it was much harder to rationalize my fear of it. It was easier to see why my uncle loved it so much.

So, the journey began. I followed my map, GPS, and compass religiously, taking no chances of getting lost out here. For the most part, the journey went well. I took the time to appreciate my surroundings, without dawdling. When I was making a route to follow, I found a stream that winded a good distance toward where I was headed. I noted a collection of rocks in the water that resembled a smiley face, taking this as an amusing, good omen of what was to come. The shallow body would be accompanying me during this first stretch, the gentle sounds of its calm waters helping ease my nerves as I hiked ever-forwards.

The first mile passed without issue. I enjoyed the sights and sounds of Appalachia along the way, and my newfound appreciation of the wilderness grew with each step. I took a small break to rehydrate and snack before pushing into the second mile.

The second mile was harder. The land started to incline ever so slightly, and the path was beset with protruding roots and rocks. It would be easy to stumble and fall flat on my face if I didn’t pay careful attention to the terrain. Towards the end of the second mile, the stream curved away from the path, no longer accompanying my trek forward. I bade it farewell and pushed onward.

The third mile.

At first, the third mile seemed like a much-needed break from the terrain of the second. Old, wrinkled leaves covered the forest floor, issuing a swirling chorus of whispers to answer every breeze. Thankfully, the fallen leaves didn't cover anything particularly dangerous. The path was much easier to walk, devoid of all the natural debris and hills of the second mile. As I pushed forward, an odd detail struck me.

I had spent a lot of time observing the environment around me. Particularly, paying close attention to the trees that surrounded my path. As I entered the latter half of the third mile, they had been subtly changing. Now, they were getting wider. *Much* wider, to the point I could imagine someone being able to carve a small dwelling into the interior of one. Some were bulbous towards the bottom, but all of them were massive. I stopped in my tracks when I noticed, taking a moment to pause and look around.

The path had grown much brighter. As I looked upward, I noticed the canopy of these trees had become much wider horizontally, and thinner vertically. Observing them in full like this, they were almost comparable to some kind of root vegetable, growing hundreds of feet up into the air, devoid of any low-hanging branches. They looked… alien to me. Certainly foreign to this forest, at least. There was nothing else even remotely like it. 

As I looked behind me, I noticed these trees stretched as far as I could see behind me. I was paralyzed. How did I not see my surroundings changing like this? Doubt was sown in my mind. I was being cautious and observant this whole time, yet it was like I had haplessly stumbled into an entirely different region. I didn't feel like I could be that blind, but it didn't change the situation. 

Taking a deep breath, I sat down for a moment, rechecking all my navigational tools.

The GPS still seemed to be functional. Cross-examining it with my map, it appeared I was getting close to the cave. It felt like a good sign. My compass was still functional, too. I took a second to calm down, making sure I was ready before going any further. In my mind, nothing could make this situation worse than stumbling around in a blind panic. After some breathing exercises, I stood up and pressed forward.

It wasn't long before things got even stranger.

After only a few minutes, I noticed the distinct sound of running water. In fact, *exactly* like the same brook I had followed for most of this trail. I slowly looked to my right, a sense of dread creeping into my heart. About two dozen feet away from me, the stream had reappeared, despite the fact I had passed it at least an hour ago.

In the center, a collection of rocks were arranged into a smiling face. 

Looking back, the stream stretched as far as I could make out, despite me only now noticing the sound of it. So I sat down, rechecking everything, my heart thumping in my chest. Cross-referencing with the map, I was still moving forward. However, as I was triple-checking *this* to be sure, I noticed something odd. The date listed on the GPS was ten years late.

It didn’t make sense. I spent all that time before setting out thoroughly inspecting *everything* I was taking with me. How could I have not noticed something like this? How was that even *possible* for a GPS? I couldn't help but fixate on this detail as I tried to push down the rising anxiety back into my gut– it may have been something small, but it was compounding on everything else that felt horribly *wrong* the further I continued. I considered heading back, but I was *so* close to my destination. There was something I needed to confirm. And, regardless of how strange my surroundings were becoming, the tools guiding me had served me without fail so far. I had no reason to doubt them, at least for navigating this forest.

Ahead, there came a fork in the path. One kept going forward, while the other bent and curved ninety degrees to the right. The path curving to the right looked much more worn by foot traffic, even including a small wooden bridge going over the brook. My immediate thought was, of course, did someone *else* live in these woods? If someone did, why didn’t I know that already? Wouldn’t my uncle have brought it up to *someone* that he had a neighbor nearby? Hell, wouldn’t the police when they came to us? 

I checked the map again, coordinating it with where the GPS said I was. Of course, it didn’t have this curving path anywhere on it. I at least considered the possibility that this could’ve been the work of my uncle at some point. But as I looked up from my map…

The bridge had changed. It looked decayed and shoddy, the planks making it up loose and splintering, nails protruding out the ends. Baffled, I walked forward to the fork, taking a look down the right-leaning path.

It was dark. The trees lining the path grew progressively more bare the further it went,  tangling together in some unholy archway that morphed the path into a foreboding, abyssal tunnel. Hesitantly, I reached into my backpack, fearing to take my eyes off of the path for even a second. I fumbled around blindly until I felt the shape of the binoculars I brought with me, taking off the lens caps and raising them to my eyes.

These binoculars were strong– I bought them before the trip to scout the area and watch distant wildlife. 

Which is why it was all the more concerning when I could barely make out an end to the path.

I say barely, because despite how dark the path grew as it continued, there was a vague shape towards the end of my vision. I swapped the magnification to eight times, and a man-made shape came into focus. From what I could make out in the shadows of the tangling trees, it appeared to be a large shed.

And there was a dim light on in the window. Flickering and wobbling like the flame of a candle. The ambient sounds of nature, the cicadas, the rustling leaves, they all fell silent. Even the river seemed to stagnate and quiet as I watched the distant light, my breath shallow, my body paralyzed.

Out here in this forest, miles away from the safety of my uncle’s house, or my car, I was not alone. And that made my blood run cold.

But not nearly as cold as when I saw the light in the window snuff out.

Something immediately took hold of my heart. It was like the instinct of fight or flight, horrifically twisted and magnified. The distinct feeling in my gut that if I didn’t leave, *now*, something horrible would happen. Something I couldn’t imagine or comprehend. It was like I was staring down into the fleshy, wet, molten gullet of a ravenous, sleeping beast, and it was starting to stir.

I stumbled over myself as I burst into a mad dash, clumsily trying to shove my binoculars into my backpack as I did. There was a stirring in the wind, and the softest breeze felt like the prelude to a tornado crashing into me. So I ran. My instincts took over. I thought I was running back home.

But, in my panic, I had gotten disorientated. I had run in the wrong direction. I ran further towards the cave.

Once I started running, I couldn’t stop. It was primal instinct. It felt like the Devil’s breath was on my neck, and my only hope in Hell was to run as far and as fast as I possibly could. I didn’t pay attention to the trees, or the rivers, or the birds, or the sounds of the forest. All I could feel was my burning lungs, all I could hear was the labored pounding of my heart in my ears. Onward and onward I ran, only slowing as the path had begun to incline. My stamina couldn’t last forever. I was decently in shape, but I was no athlete. My pace slowed, the adrenaline unable to carry me forever.

Then, rasping and wheezing, I finally took a moment to properly observe where I was. And I saw it.

The cave. Just a bit farther up this inclined path, staring back at me like a pitch-black monolith. The same cave I saw in my dreams.

My heart sank. Had I exchanged one abyss for another? This was my goal, to make it here. But now, I would rather be anywhere else. I looked around, and the forest seemed… normal. The trees had returned to their… usual look, before all the oddities on the trek here. If something was following me, I couldn’t see a single trace of it, even from the heightened position I had now to peer further down the path. I finally collapsed onto the dirt, still panting from exhaustion as I brought my attention back to the cave. 

The cave was carved into the face of a cliff overlooking the forest, the entrance narrow and tall. Judging from my position here, it was about ten feet wide and about thirty feet tall. Due to its position, The entrance would be nearly pitch-black until sunset, the only possible angle for the sun to hit it.

And sunset was rapidly approaching.

I wasn’t sure how. I had kept good track of the time throughout the journey; I did so specifically in case it took longer than expected, I would have enough time to make it back before nightfall. I felt like I should have been more scared than I was, but the physical exhaustion turned to bitter resignation in my mind.

“Of *course* things would get worse,” I thought.

It was by my own choice that I was here. I may have felt justified in doing so, but if I was going to knowingly put myself at risk, I had to also take responsibility for it. Kicking my feet and crying about the unfairness of the situation I got myself into would get me nowhere.

So, I took a break to rest and collect myself. However, spending the time to do so meant a majority, if not all of the trek back would be in the dark. An hours-long journey with little visibility beyond my flashlight. And in woods this heavily forested, a single hand-held flashlight did little. It helps you see the path ahead, but not the things that lie beyond and outside of it.

Hopefully, this makes it more understandable why sleeping overnight in the abyssal cave behind me was a choice I was actively considering. Neither were attractive options, but they were the two options I had. But, as I stared into the ink-black void that was the cave, it dredged up a feeling familiar to what I experienced when I first saw the shack – a feeling of creeping dread, working its way around my heart and slowly throttling it. I took a deep breath, deciding to at least take a closer look at the entrance before making my decision. The sun began its slow descent as I walked further up the path towards the cave, the orange glow pouring along the ground towards the cliff alongside me. Step by hesitant step, I approached the entrance, my anxiety growing the closer I drew to it.

My pace grew slower the closer I got, every fiber of my being straining against me to try to pull me away. It was all I could do to take a step, let alone hide my fear or shaking hands. Despite everything, I managed to make it a couple of yards outside of the entrance. Refusing to pull my eyes off the black pit, I retrieved my flashlight from my backpack and aimed at the cave. With another shaky breath, I flicked it on. The beam cast itself into the darkness, and…

It was swallowed completely.

All I could make out was parts of the rocky floor and walls, and *nothing* else. For as bright as the flashlight was, there was no end in sight to the cavern. I thought to get a closer look, but my legs were locked in place. The imagery from my dreams swam through my mind, paralyzing me. If the cave swallowed the light so easily, what would it do to me?

As I stood there, petrified, the sunlight reached me again, pouring over me as it inched closer and closer to the cave. As I watched, enraptured, I could hear something from the cave. It wasn’t a bellowing roar or a blood-curdling growl. It was a soft buzzing.

The fluttering of wings.

And then, below and far behind me, a sound more terrifying than anything I had heard during my time here.

A human voice.

I turned quickly, trying to identify it-- but had no such luck. The sun was sharp in my eyes, and squinting left me little room to identify them. They spoke in words incomprehensible beyond the raspy hisses of their “S”s, and they began marching towards me with slow, heavy steps. I instinctively took a step back. Most of their form was still cast in shadow. All I could make out was what appeared to be a male figure, and the smile stretching across his lips.

I called out for him to stop moving. I demanded it. With a shaky voice at first, and then with as much command as I could muster. It wasn’t a lot, but clear enough to be heard and understood.

He kept marching toward me. I took another step back. The buzzing behind me grew louder, morphing into a high-pitched hum. I didn’t know where else to step. Trying to sprint downhill past him was a dangerous prospect. He wasn’t running toward me *now*, but I couldn’t shake the feeling he wouldn’t hesitate to follow suit if I did. I was being cornered, slowly and surely, between the cave and this man.

Closer and closer, he kept plodding towards me. I could feel his gaze burning a hole into me. Even as he grew closer, I couldn’t understand a word he was saying. It was like a low and hoarse whisper was being cast directly into my ears from wherever he stood, and each incomprehensible word filled me with an unshakable feeling of helplessness and disgust. His very presence felt like a violation. He stepped closer, and closer, no string of protests and warnings able to halt him in his tracks and I finally reached a breaking point– the words flinging violently out of my throat as I reached into my pack and pulled out the serrated knife I brought with me, holding it forward as threateningly as I could in my trembling hand. 

“I SAID STOP!”

The scream echoed across the forest, bouncing between the mountains and trees. And then a sound bounced right back. A familiar, haunting bugle, the braying of a distant beast. The man finally froze in his tracks, his form still indistinguishable, but his expression falling.

His ragged lips curved in an expression of bitter, barely contained rage. The world grew completely silent, the moment frozen in time for an eternity. All before I heard the first understandable words the man spoke to me. They rang clear as a pin dropping in the preceding silence.

*“You shouldn’ta done that, boy.”*

He started moving toward me again, crushing the dirt underfoot with his now enraged stamping. The humming behind me grew louder. My heart pounded in my ears. His whispers clouding my mind were now even more cruel and bitter, but I could still only make out the feeling, not the words. Everything was reaching a crushing crescendo, the cacophonous overlapping noises overpowering my mind. I dropped the flashlight and knife, clutching my head in my hands as I retreated further backward towards the cave.

Then, I heard it. Over everything else, the *fluttering.* A hundred thousand wings beat behind me, drowning out everything, even the violent whispers had been assaulting my mind. The setting sun poured into the cave, and something in it was coming for the light. *Rushing* toward it.

Without a second thought, I hit the ground, covering my neck. I heard the man scream as a swarm of moths flew from the cave entrance like a furious tide, bowling into him and knocking him down. I could see him careening down the hill, rendered helpless against the swarm rushing into him, the sky itself filling with what must have been millions of their ilk. So many it blotted out the sun.

In my panic, I heard that bugling cry again. The call of the beast that had shown itself to me the previous night. This time, it didn’t feel like a haunting warning; it felt like a starter pistol. The sound brought me out of my terrified stupor, reminding me that now was my time to *run.*

I stumbled upward, covering my mouth to protect it from the thousands of moths whirling around me. And I ran. I ran, despite my complete lack of energy, despite the pain in my gut, the aching of my legs and feet, the burning in my lungs. I rushed past the man who was still screaming as the swarm covered every inch of his body, rushing toward the path home, his cries unintelligible as he was smothered by the mass of winged insects.

As I ran as fast as my exhausted body would take me, another oddity graced my rushed journey home. Rapidly, the weather and climate around me were changing. One moment, it would be pouring rain, muddying the dirt below my boots and scattering the moths for a moment. The next, a scorching summer daylight would return to the path, drying the ground and filling the air with the sound of cicadas. Then, as the fluttering moths washed past me, the leaves of the trees above grew auburn and quickly fell to the earth. The river accompanying me would grow silent as it froze over, and then it would repeat in a cycle, the seasons rapidly fading into each other as I ran for my life.

I didn’t know how much more I had in me. My body was screaming at me to stop, while my mind screamed at me to keep running. It was an hours-long journey back home, and I knew I couldn’t do this forever. I was reaching my hard limits, ready to collapse at any moment. As I gave myself one last push forward, my foot caught a protruding root, sending me crashing into the dirt, hard. The pain was excruciating for my already aching body, but I knew I couldn’t stop. I dug my fingers into the dirt, screaming as I strained to pull myself forward, inch by inch. I tried to push myself back onto my feet, but my legs were like jelly. So I crawled. Crawled as the swarm parted ahead of me, as I lost track of the trees, and…

I looked up.

I was home.

I looked up in complete disbelief, wondering if this was all some insane dream I would wake up from any moment. It was just as hard to accept the reality of the sight before me now as everything that came before it. Like a return to normalcy was in itself abnormal. I continued crawling forward, every advance making my muscles burn in agony. With laborious effort, I reached the backdoor, painfully pulling myself back onto my feet and twisting the handle.

Seeing the inside of the house again felt bewildering. Like I didn’t belong here. I did my best to shake the feeling, letting my pack slide off my exhausted shoulders and crash into the ground. I dragged myself with a small limp towards the bathroom, standing over the sink, in front of the mirror.

I was covered in dirt, mud, and scratches all over. My clothes had seen better days. Despite it all, the person who stared back at me in the mirror was still me.

It didn’t feel like it was me, but I was plenty used to that already. I stared at my mud-caked face for a long while before reaching for the faucet and turning on the water. My first thought was to wash my hands and face, and it was all I could do to not stick my mouth on it and drink straight from the tap. My throat, like everything else, was killing me.

After composing myself in the bathroom, I put a minimal amount of effort into making a meal and ate at the dinner table in complete silence, staring with tired eyes out the window of the back door. I thought about what had happened, what it meant, and whether or not I should keep going. I was alive. But now, there was an actual, tangible threat out in those woods. I hesitate to call whatever he was a person, but it could be the forest playing tricks on me. In the same way the path had become more and more twisted as I traveled along it, maybe it could do something similar to people. Some lost soul haunting Appalachia, warped and unraveled by its wicked nature. 

In this line of thought, I caught myself vilifying the forest *itself* yet again. In truth, what had it really done? Nothing. As far as I knew, it wasn’t some maligned entity waiting to swallow me whole. Still, there was something *wrong* with the woods. That much was crystal clear. Either something was corrupting it, or it was defiling those inside it.

And if I had seen all this so soon, God, what had my uncle seen? What could he have possibly gone through staying so long in this place? I was at least thankful the man in the woods was not *him.* I would have recognized my uncle by his voice alone. And, judging from my own experiences, and how my mother spoke of him, he would sooner throw himself off a cliff than hurt another living soul-- let alone his own family.

No, whatever… *whoever* that thing was… he was someone else. I could be certain of that, if nothing else. Unanswered questions aside, the most important thing right now was that I no longer felt safe in these woods. More than ever, it was clear I was *not* as alone as I once thought I was. So, I made plans for the following day.

I would travel to the small town a few miles away from the house. Getting out for a bit would be good… socializing with other human beings would be good, too. Maybe I could even get some info out of them that might help my investigation.

That aside, having a proper weapon would make me feel a lot safer.

I should be more clear. 

By that, I mean a gun. I couldn’t see myself going back into those woods without one, at this point. Seeing the clear danger now, I felt stupid not having taken that precaution to begin with. The knife and bear spray felt like enough at the time, but I no longer feel that way. Maybe if I had retrieved the bear spray instead of the knife, it could have done something, but… I can’t help but have lingering doubts as to its potential effectiveness on whatever he was.

I have a lot more faith in what a bullet could do to him than some chemical deterrent, at least.  

After finishing my thoughts and my meal, I double-checked all the doors and windows to make sure they were locked, and headed to bed. I thought I’d have more trouble sleeping, but I was out like a light the second I hit the mattress. Didn’t even dream. Out one moment, back the next.

Stands to reason I woke up sore and tired as all hell. Did my best to take a shower and get in a fresh set of clothes, generally freshening up. Applied a few bandages here and there to cover up my scratches, and made myself breakfast. After collecting a few things in my pack, it was straight to the car. Where I am now– writing this. I don’t see myself staying in the town for long, but I’m keeping this journal with me. I’ll leave it in the glove box so it’s easy to find on the off-chance something happens, but I should be fine. Once I’ve spent a full day in the town and have more to say, I’ll write the next entry.

I feel like a moron asking this, but… wish me luck?

I know, realistically, I’m talking to no one right now, at this moment. But… putting the request out there, somewhere, at least makes me feel a little better. Even if I end up the only one who sees the words put down in this journal… at least it’s somewhere. It doesn’t mitigate the anxiety all that much, but I need anything I can get right now.

It’ll be fine.

I have to believe it’ll be fine.
