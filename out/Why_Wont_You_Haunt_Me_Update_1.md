Update 1

So, like I said in my previous post I was at the bedside of my friend Anne when she passed…mentally and three days later she was taken from life support and passed physically. As you can imagine I was numb. My mind disconnected to cope with losing her. It was like going deaf in one ear. You can still hear but something is wrong…lost…and the world is unclear.

Since there was not going to be a wake or funeral per her request many of us…Anne’s friends took to social media to mourn her. I was doomscrolling when I saw something that froze me.  An acquaintance of ours, Ben Pires, an alleged psychic medium had posted this:

***Ben: Good News One and All. Anne reached out to me last night after her passing and wanted me to insure that all of you know that she is in a better place.***

Anne and I had always been skeptical of Psychic Mediums and of Ben especially. The idea that he would take her death as an opportunity to grow his business was bullshit and my initial instinct was to call him out but then I thought…What if he could talk to Anne? Could I be shutting out that possibility? I clicked on his profile and then went to the direct messages.

My hands floated above the keyboard. Was I really going to do this? After years of trying to debunk these assholes am I going to reach out to one?

Fuck it.

I wrote:

***John: Hey Ben, I saw your post from earlier. I was with Anne in the hospital, and I am sure that her passing was as much of a surprise to you as it was to me. I know that we have not been in the best terms the past few years, but I need your help. There were a lot of things left unsaid between Anne and I and if there is any way you can help me contact her spirit I would appreciate it. I don’t have much money, but I would be willing to part with some if you can help me.***

I cringed and gritted my teeth so hard when I pressed the send icon that I almost cracked a tooth. Almost immediately the response dots fired up and began their dance on my screen. If Ben was going to tell me to kiss his ass at least it would be quick, and I can give up on this nonsense.

***Ben: Hey, I wasn’t expecting to hear from you. Thanks for reaching out. Yeah I was on my Ouija board last night and she reached out with that message. I thought you guys thought I was full of shit.***

***John: I know we came across that way in the past, but I really think you made a connection, and I want to pursue it.***

***Ben: This feels like a setup. Are you going to tape or stream this?***

***John: No. No Setup, no stream, no broadcast I just want to ask her something.***

***Ben: What if she doesn’t respond?***

***John: Then she doesn’t, and I know that door is closed.***

***Ben: Ok, fair enough. I’m gonna need a grand.***

***John: 1000?***

***Ben: Yeah, that’s the skeptics rate.***

***John: Venmo?***

***Ben: Sure.***

***John: When can we do it?***

***Ben: Saturday morning 3:15am***

***John: WTF?***

***Ben: Best time to talk to the dead my friend.***

***John: Fine, I’ll Venmo the cash on Friday.***

He paused. The dots flickered again.

***Ben: She said you’d come.***

My heart skipped a beat with that last message. He was probably fucking with me, but what if he wasn’t?

The week went by slowly. I watched all our friends virtually mourn Anne’s passing. There were incredible pictures of her young and in school plays and musicals, worked crazy jobs, travelled, she was a remarkable person. My affection for her was not without grounds. Anne was legitimately cool.

A few people even direct messaged me to give condolences and tell me about Anne’s affection for me. They did not know that those messages were like a swarm of little daggers stabbing me in the heart.

How could they know?

Friday night came and I prepared by drinking gallons of coffee. Being older I no longer had the natural ability to stay up to 3 am so I needed caffeine to assist me.

Ben lived in the south end of Fall River in a three story tenement building. To my chagrin he was on the top floor. He had messaged me and said he would unlock the side door so I could come up. He didn’t want his eighty-year-old landlord Mrs. Saraiva waking up. I was slow to open the door, and it creaked loud enough to wake the damned. The stairway reeked of stale fried codfish. Every old Portuguese tenement in Fall River smelled like that.

I persisted up the stairs.

By the time I reached the top floor the heart monitor on my watch said I was doing 120 beats per minute. This was a mixture of all those steps and anxiety.

After I knocked on the door a couple of times it opened to reveal Mr. Ben Pires, thirty five, bald, with a goatee that looked like a poor attempt to be Anton LeVay.

“Hey, glad you made it,” he said.

“Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” I said. I really wanted to say that I could not believe I was doing this shit, but I was trying to make up for years of skepticism.

Ben was dressed as expected in all black. He wanted to look like a master of the mystic arts and understood the role perfectly. He walked me over to a wooden table where he already had the Ouija board.

He gestured to a seat directly across from the accessories.

“Please sit,” he said.

I did without a word, and he reciprocated in his own chair.

“Thanks for paying so quickly,” he said.

I had taken one of those internet payment plans to spread the thousand dollars over the course of a year because I didn’t have the whole sum. But he didn’t need to know that. As far as Ben was concerned I was flush with cash.

“Now, let’s get to business.”

“Yes, let’s,” I said.

Ben put his fingers on the planchette and began to speak.

*“Spirits, we seek entry. We call for one traveler among you. Let her cross, if she can.”*

His fingers began to vibrate and a few seconds later the planchette moved toward the “Yes” symbol on the board.

“We’re in,” he said.

I sat stoic. This wasn’t my first paranormal rodeo.

“Spirit world we are searching for a soul. The soul of our friend Anne. Can you bring her forth?”

Ben paused here. Then his fingers and the planchette swirled around the board in a figure eight. When they finished they landed back on the “Yes.” Ben nodded in affirmation of his own prowess.

“Are you there spirit?”

Again, the swirl. Again the “Yes”. A smile bloomed on Ben’s face like a sunflower.

“Is it you Anne? John is here. He is looking for you.”

Ben’s fingers traced the figure eight again. The planchette glided to *Yes.* His smile widened.  
“Is it you, Anne? John is here. He needs to hear from you.”

The planchette spun faster this time. My pulse quickened. It slowed. Stopped.

And the pointer rested hard on one word.

**No.**
