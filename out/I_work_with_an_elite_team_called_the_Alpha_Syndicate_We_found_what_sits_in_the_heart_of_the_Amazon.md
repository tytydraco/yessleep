***“Five.”***

Trevor’s voice crackled in the headset as I pressed my body against the wall. I looked over to Paige, watching as she quickly put a small brick of C-4 over the door frame.  Her eyes met mine as she gave me a nod. I returned it and checked my rifle, making sure the suppressor was tight. 

***“Four.”***

The glint of Eric’s scope reflected off the moonlight in the distance. He was about 100 yard’s away, sights trained on the door. The rose bush that he was sitting in swayed gently in the summer breeze. Looking around, this place really did have its own type of beauty. The garden was dotted with different kinds of flowers. Roses, Tulips, and Orchids flooded the landscape in a sea of colors. It felt like I had been dropped into a Van Gogh painting. 

***“Three.”***

I checked my face mask, making sure it was secured over my mouth and nose. I could feel the rubber digging into my cheeks, breathing in the filtered air, hot and stale. Briefing indicated potential airborne agents that would cause… change. Metamorphosis, Trevor called it. A forced evolution, and an unwanted one. 

***“Two.”***

I felt Wades tap on my shoulder, signaling me. My hand shot to my hip, grabbing a flat black square. I stuck it to the door frame and jammed my finger on the center. Instantly, five red dots popped up on the square moving erratically. Almost jerking, moving smoothly only for a second or two, then stopping and jumping forward. I turned and held up five fingers to Wade, who nodded and slammed the bolt home on his machine gun.

***“One.”*** 

I took a breath to settle my heart rate, feeling the ridges of the rifle’s grip. It was calming. Like as long as I held on, nothing could ever hurt me. Paige’s detonator being primed snapped me from my self reflection as quickly as it came. One more breath. One more second of safety.

***“Send it.”***

The calm was gone. The storm was here. The shit had hit the fan and there was no turning back. The charge shattered the door to splinters. I raised my rifle, turned in, and went to work.

There was no time to think. Instinct fueled me as I pushed inside, my eyes locking on to the target in front of me. The blast must have knocked them to the ground, seeing as they were still struggling to get to their feet, grabbing at a table to level themselves. I put two shots in the thing and swung left. 

***“On your six Rook.”***

I felt Paige glide behind me as she put two into another one on the right hand side of the table. It was hard to focus. Trevor had cut the power so while I knew we were in the kitchen, I could hardly see anything. I moved slowly around the table listening for footsteps, watching the shadows for anything out of place. Something gave out a gurgled cry and lunged at me from the left side and I jumped backward. I had made it just in time as a large cleaver wedged itself into the hardwood. The creature chattered to itself while trying desperately to pull the knife out, making strange scritches and groans. Sounded like a lab rat that knew his time was up. The thing made it real easy for me to sight in as I turned its brain to mist, spraying the back wall with what was left of…whatever it was.

A few more shots let off before I heard, 

***“Clear.”***

A neon green light took over the room as Paige cracked a glow stick and dropped it on the table. Now that I was actually able to see, I could tell how nice the kitchen was. A long industrial sized shell of a room wrapped around me. Pans hung from the ceiling dropping down and swaying a bit before giving a soft little chime. The table itself must have been used to carve meat. It was stained all over with blood, the once yellowed wood taking on a soft orange hue with bones littering the tabletop. I bent down to pick one up and examine it. It was thin and long, possibly a rib bone. It had been stripped whole and bleached a bright white. What stood out to me most though, was the number of bite marks covering it. 

I looked down and examined the rest. They were all the same. Stripped and bleached yes but gnawed on. It came to me that these bones started to get bigger. Different bones, different parts from the corpse. These bones looked familiar, they couldn’t have been from an animal. 

***“Think I found Delta’s guy.”***  I said after dropping the bone back onto the heap.

***“You’re sure?”*** Paige answered back after kicking a body away from the table.

***“Come see for yourself.”*** 

I took the time to snap open my own glow stick and check the body of one of the creatures. Bending down I could see it was dressed in a dirty, handmade robe. The hood covering its face hung heavy. I had to actively try to lift it and underneath I saw why. It’s face was bare with no eyes, thin little slits for nostrils, and a wide, lipless mouth that hung open exposing broken jagged teeth. The ears had been removed, in their place sat two small craters, oozing green liquid down its blister covered neck. It was only when I lifted the head up that I found the eyes. All seventeen of them, protruding from the back of the creature's head. There was a deep purple covering where the whites were supposed to be and cat like cuts for the irises. I let it go with a wet smack onto the blood covered tile. Whoever these creatures were before the change, they made a damn good job to be as far from human as possible. 

Paige’s voice broke me from my thoughts.

***“Whiskey Two to Whiskey One how copy?”***

***“Copy Whiskey Two.”*** Trevor’s voice came back. ***“What do ya got?”***

***“We found Delta Three. What’s left of her anyway. Primary objective reached. Requesting extraction.”***

Before Trevor could respond an angry, oily voice, heavy in a New Jersey accent came over the line.

***“Negative Whiskey Two standby.”***

The line went dead as Paige let out a frustrated groan. ***“God Dammit Shay. Pinche Pendejo”***

Shay was the leader of Delta team. One of the Syndicates Twenty-six squads that operated around the world. He prided himself on pulling the most dangerous and lucrative jobs. With that clout however, came with him running his team ragged. Job after job, often operating for more than a month at a time. No wonder his girl got made. 

***“Whiskey Two be advised.”*** Trevor came back online again. ***“Operational parameters have changed.”***

***“Changed to what Trevor?”*** Paige responded with just a hint of frustration.

***“This is no longer a snatch and grab. Rendezvous with Delta at the entrance and initiate extermination protocols.”***

I could feel Paige’s frustration grow but she just nodded and responded. 

***“Understood. Whiskey Two out.”***

The line went dead as she reloaded and walked towards the door leading deeper inside.

***“Come on, Rook.”*** Her voice was laced with equal parts venom and determination. ***“I told you back in that conference room we’d be cleaning up this fucker’s mess.”***

\* \* \*

The conference room had been packed when we walked in. At least ten people inside, huddled together in tiny groups on opposite sides of the room. Each one strapped down with various weapons, and decked out in the latest gear the Syndicate could afford. 

“Do we normally pull joint ops with other teams?” I asked as I took my seat and reached for a manilla folder marked ‘OPERATION: GARDENER’ in big red letters.

“Not a common thing but not unheard of either.” Trevor said, scanning the room. “Happened a lot more in the good ole days. Back when the Syndicate just started out, we didn’t have the training and vetting we do now. Half the time it seemed like they just found the biggest dude in the bar and put a gun in his hand” I tried to keep my head down a bit and act like that’s not exactly how they got me. If it aint broke then don’t fix it I guess.

“Looks like we got Romeo and Delta along for the ride.” He continued before walking up to a woman on the right of us. She was tall with jet black hair that was half shaved, leaving the other side to fall over the left of her face.The MP5 she wielded was strapped to her waist while she thumbed through another op folder. She stopped when Trevor approached and gave a smile.

“Hey Kate, how ya been?” 

“My my my. If it isn’t Trevor Whitlock. Been a while.” Her voice was soft and seductive, like she breathed it into Trevor’s ear instead of out loud. “Last I heard you had some trouble on the Nile.”

“Never trouble. Just a minor…” He scratched the scruff of his short, graying beard as he thought. “Inconvenience.”

“That’s not what I heard.” She said in a sing-song voice as she stood upright. She was easily half a foot taller than he was. “At least that’s not what management says.”

“Management says a lot of things.” 

“That they do. When I got word Romeo was taking over your contracts for the time being I feared the worst.” She stepped a bit closer to Trevor. Whatever tension was currently happening It didn’t seem to phase him. 

“Look, if we need to leave, just say it.” Eric piped up resulting in a hand planting itself firmly into the back of his head, courtesy of Paige.

“Don’t get used to it.” Trevor responded after a moment.  “CONUS duty just gave me a chance to get the Kid trained up. We’ll be back in the field in no time.” 

This caused her attention to turn towards me. She began making her way over and put her hand out to shake mine.

“Kate Watanabe.” She said with a smile that was trying way too hard to be friendly.

“Marcus Kent.” I said as I took her hand and shook it. She seemed odd, doll-like would be the best way to describe it. Like she wanted you to notice her, to like her. She let go of my hand and turned back to Trevor, completely ignoring the others. 

“Good seeing you Trevor. Stay out of trouble now okay?” She said with a wink as she joined the rest of her team.

“God I hate her.” I heard Paige let out as soon as Kate was out of earshot. 

“You just hate her because she’s into Trevor.” Eric said teasingly. “Ain’t that right Wade?”

“Look man.” Wade said, dropping into his chair with a mighty thud. “There’s only a few things I’m scared of. Paige is one of those things. You’re on your own.” 

We all let out a laugh as Trevor walked back, leaning in so only we could hear. “Do you think for just once you can act like professionals? Did you even consider why they pulled two teams off active duty and brought us up?” 

The table grew silent as we all looked down or away. Anything to not meet his gaze. He waited a moment before exhaling and sitting next to me.

“Grab a folder and pay attention. Here they come.” 

Susan Bell, the short, stubby woman who acts as the main presenter in briefings walked down the aisle towards the projector. By her side, however, walked a large, barrel chested, gorilla of a man wearing a muscle tank and cargo pants. His skin was tanned, well from what I could see, as most of it was covered in arm hair. His face didn’t leave anything bare either. A gruff beard ran from neck to lip then up to an unkempt goatee. The mutton chops on the side of his head covered his jaw as they reached out to touch his chin. A long jagged scar across his eye completed his wildman look. He approached the podium as Susan dimmed the lights and turned on the projector. Whatever conversations that were still being had immediately went silent as he placed a massive shotgun on the table next to him. 

“Evening. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Shay LaGrand, leader of Delta, and operation overseer for this mission. “

We stayed silent as the projector flipped through to an image of a latin man. He was smiling with his hair slicked back wearing a tuxedo. It was a pretty old picture, judging from the graininess. Maybe taken back in the 90’s.

“Meet Raul Delgado. Bolivia’s hot shot botany genius way back when. This is the last known picture of Raul before his trek into the Amazon Basin. He was in search of finding plants that could be used to counteract something known as Stoneman’s Syndrome, a disease that causes the body to overproduce calcium deposits and make bone grow on the outside of the body. This-” He said as the slide changed. “Is when he returned.” 

On the screen was a black and white photo of…something. It was humanoid for sure. But it was also pure white, latticed with shards of bone crossing, and weaving the whole body. Where his head of slick black hair once was, now rested a cocoon of bone. It twisted and circled around his face till it ended in a small, black hole in the center. It was walking towards the camera, arms outstretched as if it was ready to be carried off by angels. In one hand he held a small leatherbound book in the other, he was clutching a flower. Its bright white seemed to draw a blindspot in the photo. Like every other color that was present when the picture was taken, was drawn into it. Each petal was marked with a single dot and the stem itself was as long as the thing that was holding it. 

“He was gone two years. In that time he not only contracted the disease…It had mutated. The man could walk, talk, and have full cognitive function. He would later go on to publish a manifesto-” The slide changed to the same picture as before yet zoomed in to focus on the book. “In it he describes his journey in the jungle. How he became separated from his party, got lost, and floated for days down the river. Supposedly he washed ashore onto a long forgotten Incan city. It was there he found the quote ‘la orquidea de dios’ or Orchid of God.” 

The next slide showed a close up of the flower. Even now it was hard to get a good look at it. The photo seemed to burn out the closer it got to the petals. It was unsettling since the rest of the picture was normal, yet when it came to the orchid, it warped. Like it didn’t want to be seen.

“He goes on and on discussing how this orchid saved his life. How it allowed him to evolve. Achieve a higher state of being. The manifesto was circulated through some fringe science communities online, gaining a bit of a cult following before Raul fell completely off the radar. We believe it was to take that online following and turn it into something tangible and dangerous.”

The next slide showed pictures of at least twenty people. All of whom were on missing persons posters.   


“In the past ten years more than thirty of the world's top biologists, botanists, and chemists have gone missing. Inside sources indicate that Mr. Delgado may be recruiting them for something called  ‘The Cultivation’. Local law enforcement has been trying for years to get a strike team in to search the place but have been failing due to what they call ‘unexplained electromagnetic phenomena’. Seems that whatever is going on there blocks out all satellite signals. In an attempt to gather information for interested third parties I have opted to send one of my own undercover to Mr. Delgado’s mountainside estate for reconnaissance.”

This last slide stood out from all of the others. Not for its bleakness but for its beauty. A mansion rested on top of a hill surrounded by a sea of flowers. Dozens of colors danced across the landscape. It went on forever, nearly enveloping the house, as it crept up and over the driveway, surrounding, and drowning the cars parked there.

“In the last few weeks our contact has been relaying information while under the guise of a fan and follower of Delgado. She talked about how they began to import certain strains of flowers from all over the world. Additionally, they’ve begun research into air filtration systems, how they work, how to maintain them et cetera. We had feared an attack was getting ready to take place until Ashley went dark. That’s why you're all here. We’re gonna raid that compound.”

A small murmur came from the tables surrounding us. People began spewing complaints left and right, mostly about what they were gonna be doing, who they were gonna be doing it with, and how much they were gonna get paid for it. Shay quickly had enough and slammed his fist onto the podium.

“Shut it!” He bellowed as the murmuring died down. “If you must know, the stipend is 100,000 per team, but I know you all have done a lot worse for a lot less, so I don’t want to hear shit about pay! We find Ashley, pull her out, cap a few people dumb enough to follow a nutcase with a green thumb and get the hell out. Am I clear?”

No one said anything as Shay scanned the room. 

“Good. Romeo you’re on overwatch, there’s a mountain range a half mile to the north of the compound.”

“Whatever you say.” I heard Kate’s cool and calm voice ring out. 

“Whiskey, you're the ground team with delta. Breach through the kitchen here on this southside. Delta will breach in through the garage. We cover more ground, we find Ashley faster. Where’s Whitlock?”

Trevor stood slowly with a groan and gave a stretch. “Right here brother.” 

“You’re with me on the command line. Full control of the powergrid and water supply. We’ll have you linked in on a closed circuit comm channel to get past the dead zone.”

“Understood. Let’s get it done.”

“Try not to fuck it up like you did Egypt.” Shay said with a sly a shit eating grin. I could feel the heat of anger begin building in Trevor. He took a second but responded in the same tone.

“We won’t let you down man.”

“You better not. Now-” Shay said while grabbing his shotgun and slinging it over his shoulders. “You all have your orders. Move out.”

\* \* \*

I followed Paige’s lead as we tiptoed down the hall. We had to move slowly through the darkness, cracking open a chemlight every few meters just to give off a smidge of glow. What was illuminated however, put me into Delgado’s shoes, into his path to madness. At first everything seemed pretty normal. Multiple degrees on the wall, shitty modern art, dressers laden with books as thick as a dictionary, the works. As we kept going down however, things began to… evolve. 

It started subtly enough. A simple houseplant rested on a stand. Even in the dim green glow it looked beautiful. Deep purple leaves with a bright, neon blue center. It was standing under a picture of Delgado and a woman. He was wearing a simple white suit that did well to give contrast to his dark skin. The woman was young, with a bright vibrant smile marked with a dimple on her right cheek and dark hair that came down to her waist. She wore a long white gown and several gaudy jewelry pieces. In front of them both was a child. A boy wearing the same style suit as Raul. Pretty much everything about him was the same. Same slicked back hair, same skin tone. The only thing that stood out was the same dimple the woman had, reflected on him. 

***“I didn’t know the mark had a family.”***  I said. Looking behind me I saw the big green light dangling off Wade’s neck pause for a moment. A glance up the hall showed that Paige’s light stopped as well. 

***“He doesn’t***.***”*** Paige’s voice cracked back softly. ***“We would have been briefed otherwise.”***

***“Yeah he does. I’m looking right at them.”***

***“Fuck are you talking about man?"*** Eric piped up. I heard the cracking of branches through the comms as he left his post to join us.

***"I'm talking about the fact that Delgado has a wife and kid! Look!"***I turned and pushed the picture to Wade as he approached. He took and held it up close to his face, using the chemlight to scan it. Slowly, his head came up, his eyes meeting mine as he tapped the earpiece and mimed the number three. I switched over to channel three on the earpiece with a slightly indignant ***“What?”***

***“There’s no one here man.”*** 

***“What? Fuck do you mean there’s no one there?”***

***“I mean-”***  He walked closer to me and showed me the picture again. My heart sank as I saw what he was talking about. There was no child. No woman smiling happy and proud. There was no Raul Delgado. Just a picture of a flower. Its long stem reaching to the top of the frame, deep purple dots, marking each white petal. 

***“What the fuck.”*** I muttered out. My hands shook softly as I studied the picture that was once a family portrait only moments ago. ***“Wade. Man, I swear I know what I saw.”***

***“I know.”*** He replied with a slow nod. His voice, while deep, was trying its best to sound soothing, to calm me. ***“We don’t know the extent of this place. We don’t know if these things can manipulate us by imagery or if it’s strictly airborne. Until we do, keep these thoughts to yourself. Last thing we need is to be worried about one of our own.”***

He was right. We were at that crossroads, where it was too late to turn back, yet too early for things to go wrong. All I could do was keep pushing forward. I put the frame back on the desk as a beeping noise came through the earpiece. We were being signaled. I flicked the comm channel as Paige’s shrill chastising came through. 

***“Wade! Markus! Where the hell are you?!”***

***“Sorry.”*** I said as I calmed the small flame of fear that burned in the back of my brain. ***“Found something on one of these dressers, Wade came to see if he could figure out what it was. Give us a second, we're right behind you.”***

***“No Rook, you’re not.”*** She exclaimed as that flame ignited even brighter. ***“I’m over by the entrance with Delta. How do you even get lost in a hallway?”***

My eyes shot towards where I last saw her. There was nothing. No chemlight, no cracked doorway to guide the way, only pitch blackness. I turned to Wade. His body was on edge as he scanned all around us. He looked over at me as I caught his eyes, apprehension causing them to appear twitchy and unfocused. ***“I don’t like this shit man.”*** He said as he fired up his mic. ***“Eric, what's your twenty?”***

***“What are you talking about man? I’m here with everyone. How the hell I got past your giant ass I’m not sure but you told me to go ahead of you.”***

***“NO Eric, I did NOT.”*** He was shouting into the comm now, frantic to understand the position we were in. 

***“Jus- et- ere-”*** Paige’s voice came back garbled over static. 

***“Paige?! Say again?”*** I needed to hear them. To have that comfort and security that was so quickly jerked from underneath me. I was greeted with nothing but static. 

***“Paige? PAIGE?!”*** 

It was no use. She was already gone.

\* \* \*

 My breath was ragged as Wade and I rushed down the hall. When Paige’s and Eric’s voices were reduced to static we threw caution to the wind and took off. Whatever adrenaline that ran through us however, was quickly extinguished when, after what must have been ten minutes of running, we had only seemed to make it about 100 feet, the moonlight illuminating the doorway to the kitchen. 

***“What…The…Fuck”*** I heaved out, clutching my knees and gasping for whatever little sips of filtered air this mask would give me.

***“It’s… Hallucinogenic… Gotta be.”*** Wade wasn’t doing any better. He was upright, but only by leaning against the wall. He coughed loudly, clearing his throat, doing his best to hold down whatever he had in his stomach. 

After a moment or two we both began to breathe properly and get our heads on right.

***“Whatever this place is, wherever we are, we can’t get there fast.”*** I said as I pulled some more chemlights out of my pack and cracked one. ***“We take it slow. Drop these every 100 paces.”***

I could hear Wade grunt and exhale deeply as he nodded. ***“Good idea. We need to see if we can get back into signal range too. First things first. Lead the way. I got your six.***

We began making our way down the hall. For whatever reason the house decided to give us passage as the light behind us started to dim. After a few minutes we finally reached the end, coming up onto a single, heavy, oak door. 

***“Careful.”*** Wade said just loud enough for the mic to pick up, almost at a whisper. 

I didn’t answer audibly, just giving a single nod as I turned the handle. Slowly, I inched the door open, pointed my muzzle inside, and began scanning the room. Without my needing to say so, I heard the crack of a chemlight as Wade tossed it as far as he could. The light that came from where it landed showed high shelves, a large wooden desk, and books as far as the eye could see. We had found our way into the madman's study.

We crept slowly inside. Everything on the walls hung still, caked in dust. This place looked like it hadn’t been used in years. 

***“Don’t believe it,”***  Wade said as he kicked over some books stacked on the ground. 

***“What do you mean?”*** I asked, looking back at him as I made my way over to the desk.

***“All this…shit.”*** He waved his hands, gesturing to the room around us. ***“I don’t buy it for a second that any of this is real. Something here is fucking with the occipital and temporal lobes of the brain. Simulating a psychotic break. We could be running around in a broom closet for all we know.”***

***“Uh huh,”*** I said as I began rifling through the drawers of the desk. There wasn’t much inside save for a few empty binders and post-it notes. ***“And what makes you an expert on human psychology?”*** 

***“In this case it’s psychiatry, and the master's degree from Harvard does.”*** He said matter of factly. I could almost see the smirk on his face as he no doubt could see the look of shock on mine. 

***“Dude-”*** I said after taking a moment. ***“Just how many jobs have you had?”***

***“Enough to know what I’m talking about.”*** He said, trying hard to stifle a laugh. ***“Let’s just say I've been around long enough to have diversified my portfolio.”***

***“Sounds like it. So how do we beat it?”*** I cracked open a few more chemlights as I made my way to the far end of the room.

Wade took a moment to think before sounding equal parts frustrated and defeated. ***"In layman's terms, you don't. You can try to offset it, but to completely pull yourself out? You have to be pulled out by someone else."*** 

*Of course we do.* I thought. They could never make anything easy.

Something… changed as I took the steps into the inky darkness. Things weren't just dirty and unused. They were rotting. The shelves were cracked and chipped, covered in a mass of termites that feasted on the remains. The books went from old to archaic. I picked one up and thumbed through the pages. I couldn't even read it. The lettering faded into almost translucent paper. The spine was non-existent. This wasn't a library anymore, but a tomb. 

I had to fight the urge to empty my supply of light in this one room. I didn't want to be here. This wasn't supposed to go like this. Trapped here in this house of horrors. I clutched a light tight to my chest as I made my way onward towards the far wall. The shelves that lined my left and my right were replaced by a large stone fireplace. You could have tossed a bear in there to roast with how wide it was. Off to the right hand side stood another heavy black door, and above it, hooked onto the massive stone chimney, was another photo. 

This one was similar to the last. It was blown to massive proportions, like some kind of twisted family portrait. There was Raul, standing there all dignified and still, well, human. It was hard to imagine that this face of scientific nobility would be morphed and twisted into the creature we were now hunting. The kid looked largely the same as before. It was just… well I couldn’t put my finger on it, but he seemed terrified. Like his facial features and posture were the same but he just, well… I could feel it. My eyes instinctively shot towards the woman. It was then that I knew what had changed. Her sweet, motherly smile was now gone. In its place sat two rows of thin, jagged teeth, curled into a joker-like grin. Her eyes cast down towards the boy, like she was sizing up her next meal. The once sleek long hair was now matted in parts, and wild in the rest, protruding in every direction, giving her the appearance of some sort of demented mad scientist.

Wade came up from behind, startling me. For someone so big he sure could be silent when he wanted to. 

***“What do you see?”*** He said as his eyes scanned the picture trying to discern what it was showing me. 

***“Well… I can tell you what it’s not.”*** I said looking over to him. He responded with a single understanding nod. It felt comforting to know I wasn't going through this alone. Sure, Wade's brain wasn't being strapped down and forced to go through a Rorschach test every twenty minutes. But, he was here. That's what mattered. 

***"So-"*** I said after turning away from the portrait, facing him fully.

***"Offsetting. How do we do it?"***

***"Simple."*** He said, holding his gaze a bit longer on the picture before turning to me. ***"Just, think of something ridiculous. Something that can't be twisted and corrupted."*** 

***"All right."*** I said skeptically. ***"Like what?"*** 

He thought for a moment before letting out a small chuckle.

***"What?"***

***"Well what's an embarrassing story from your childhood?"***

His question threw me for a loop. I nearly forgot that we were lost in a fun house stuffed with Heaven's Gate rejects. 

***"You're serious?"*** I asked after a moment.

***"As a heart attack."***

***"Um…"*** I racked my brain, trying to think. ***"Oh. I guess when I got caught wearing my sister's cheerleading outfit one time when I was six?"*** 

There was silence for a moment. I saw Wade's laughter before I heard it. His body heaving back and forth. He let out a massive howl and clutched his stomach, laughing his ass off. 

***"Whew, God I gotta hear the outcome of this."*** 

***"Nah man, that wasn't the deal. What about you, huh? What stupid shit did little Wade get into?"***

It took him a moment to stop laughing. Honestly this conversation was making me feel a little bit better. It was easier to forget the last thirty minutes. Even for a moment. 

Wade wiped his eyes as he looked at me. ***"When I was little I got attacked by a group of chickens. My grandpa had some that I would feed when I came to visit. I was about four carrying a bucket one day when I tripped and got covered in feed. Little fuckers had a field day."***

It was my turn to laugh now. I clutched my stomach and howled imagining the giant Wade being bested by some one-foot hens. I heard Wade's boots crunch on the floor as he put his hand on my shoulder.

***"You laugh but those things are ferocious, feel better?"***

I nodded and wiped my eyes. **“Yeah.”** I said, standing up, and turning towards the door. **“*****Let's go put a bullet in this thing."***

He swept his hand towards the door as he positioned himself behind me.

***"Lead the way. And remember, be aggressive. B E aggressive."***

***"Fuck you."*** I said with a chuckle as I twisted the handle and threw the door open. 

\* \* \*

The hallway we found ourselves in now was the complete opposite of the one before. Instead of the dark and dingy tunnel that we ran from, this place was a warm and cozy reprieve. Gone was the rotting hardwood. Instead itt was replaced by a rolling red carpet leading to a massive white door with six black dots painted in a circle around it. Candelabras dotted the many countertops and side tables in view, rendering our chemlights useless. Pictures covered the walls from top to bottom, all displaying the same unsettling image from the room before.

***"Is it weird that this place is creepier than where we just came from?"*** I said as I took a step inside.

***"Maybe the house is settling for enticing over sheer terror."*** Wade whispered out as we made our way further in.

***"Doubt it."*** I did my best to avoid looking at the pictures as I walked along. Didn't want to know what other shit this place was going to pull out of its bag of tricks. As I got about halfway however, I couldn't stop myself. There was a glint at the corner of my eye and I glanced over to take a look. I immediately wished I hadn't. The woman was leaning down to the boy now. Her jaw unhinged to an enormous width as her teeth rested on either side of his head. His cheeks were swollen and red as a thin line of tears streaked down his face. 

I couldn't take it anymore. I was tired of being fucked with. I jammed my fist into the glass and ripped the photo from its frame, tearing it into pieces before dropping it to the floor.

***"Easy man. Don't let it get to you so bad it's just-"***

He trailed off as a noise started echoing in the room. Like a fly right in your ear, an incessant buzzing. It was only when I looked down that I saw what it was. The torn shreds of the picture were moving. Vibrating. I was about to bend down to inspect them when I heard the same sound coming from the frames on the desk and all of the pictures on the walls. Every single one was moving and shifting. It sounded like we were in an earthquake when suddenly they all stopped. 

***"Well… that was weir-"*** Suddenly all the glass shattered at once, covering us in a shower of clear, jagged, grains. The pictures flew from their frames. They swirled around us before flying towards the white door. 

***"Please tell me I'm not the only one seeing this!"*** I yelled out over the swelling cacophony of the paper smacking against the door, each photo overlaying the other, covering every free space it could find. 

***"Trust me you're not!"*** Wade yelled. His eyes were wide and transfixed before him in terror.

I turned back towards the door and saw why. My blood ran cold. The chill of recognition falling over me. 

The pictures were folding and twisting around each other at such speed that they began to make some semblance of a movie. The woman's face appeared as she was when I first saw her. Smiling normal and meaningful, but that quickly began to change. Her eyes bulged as her smile widened to an inhuman size. Her teeth cracked on themselves forming small serrated daggers that began to hone in on the small boy. His tears were falling in motion now as he was powerless to move. She leaned down and opened her maw, a forked, snakelike tongue twisting and flicking against her now serpentine mouth. Her jaw extended wider, cracking the bones open as she settled it around his head and shoulders. My eyes met his and for one brief moment he moved. His mouth silently mimed; *help me,* as her jaw slammed shut.

***"What the fuck is this!?"*** I yelled as I clicked the safety off and raised it to the door. She released her jaws letting the body fall flat and half eaten, organs strewn on the flowing green grass. Time seemed to fast forward as she turned her attention to Raul. Her body began to shift and twitch as bones dislocated and shattered. What was once a beautiful young woman turned into a long, flesh colored serpent, wrapping herself around the man. He stood so still, like a statue, looking out at us as her jaw unhinged once again and she latched onto his head. 

The snake began undulating and heaving as it worked its way down Raul's body. He never moved. Not even so much as a twitch. Before my eyes, the snake had reached his feet and lifted up, completely consuming him. I froze. I didn't know whether to pull the trigger and remove this from my sight or turn and run. Its slitted eyes met mine as it heaved again. Not a sick heave. But a heave of laughter. 

It's body shifted for the very last time. This time, into the form of a human. It began growing long bone-white appendages for its arms and legs. Its body wrapped itself in a carapace of a lashing white exoskeleton. The final shift was completed by its head slowly bubbling like melted putty as it formed a cone around itself with one single black hole at the center.

It stood there with its arms outstretched. Its body bending backward at an unnatural angle as it pushed its chest towards the sky. The pictures or camera or whatever the hell this was, panned upward. It showed the sun beating down, so much was the intensity that I could nearly feel the heat. And then it was eclipsed. A vine so massive passed in our view as we slowly panned back down. Before us, sat a single being. It was covered in its bone white body, one hand outstretched and delicately, almost lovingly, wrapped around the bud of a flower. Its six white petals were each dotted with a single purple mark that seemed to suck in the light and color around it, clogging our vision. 

***"The Orchid!"*** I gasped out and started to turn to Wade ***"It's not the house doing this. It's not Raul, it's that fucking Orc-"*** I stopped in my tracks. Wade's eyes were glossed over. His machine gun hung limply at his side as he smiled, tears streaming down his face.

***"Do you see it?"*** He asked, fighting back tears. ***"Doesn't it look so beautiful?"***

***"What?!"*** I slapped Wade across the face. ***"Okay no, not here. We're not doing this. Wake the fuck up man!"*** I snapped my fingers in his ears, shaking him, nothing worked as he dropped to his knees. Like he was kneeling to a higher power. ***"All she wants is us to grow."*** He finally turned to me, smiling wide. ***"To evolve. To become more than we are now."*** He clutched at me with his massive paws. ***"We just need to let her in, Markus."***

***"Wade!"*** I slapped him again, this time harder. ***"Snap out of it!"*** It was like a toddler throwing a punch at Mike Tyson. Nothing seemed to work. Suddenly, I heard a snap behind me and turned back to the door. The creature in the photos was standing upright now looking at me, its head cocked to the side. It twitched jarringly back and forth, like a badly puppetted doll. Then in an instant it leapt at me. It ran so unnaturally. Its legs jerked and popped while its body stayed rigid, and it moved so remarkably fast. I brought my weapon up again, sighting in on it as it reached its long fingers out, grabbing at me. It reached to the forefront of the picture. As I fired, I could have sworn that its fingers breached through to the material world..

I emptied an entire mag into the door. I heard the splinters of wood as my bullets cut through. Sawdust kicked up as I reloaded and aimed again waiting to see the creature's body in front of me. 

But I didn't see it. The thing was gone. The only thing in front of me was a bullet riddled white door. 

I heard Wade groan, feeling the ground creak as he sat up. 

***"Ugh, what the hell just happened?"*** He asked, looking up at me.

I reached out to him, extending my hand for him to take. ***"Nothing man. Don't worry about it."*** He eyed me for a moment but grabbed onto me as I helped pull him up. 

***“Let’s go.”*** I said with a sigh, looking away from him and turning to the door. ***“Almost there.”***

I heard the sound of his bolt being pulled back as I began walking. 

***“Right behind you.”***
