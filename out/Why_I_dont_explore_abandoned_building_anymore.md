Hello everyone. I don't normally talk about this or even allow myself to think about this at all. However, seeing everyone else in this sub relay unusual stories without judgment has persuaded me to tell this story. Besides, it feels fair to Eliza to finally get this out there.

Just for some context, throughout school, I was somewhat of an outsider. I wasn't in the "unpopular, bullied loser" category, though. There were certainly a few kids like that in my school system until high school when most of the bullies of the grade calmed down quite a bit and took to just making fun of people behind their backs so as to avoid a lasting reputation as a bully. At least, that's what I think. I was *just* an outsider. I remember a few kids trying to test me in elementary school a couple of times; I just didn't back down the first time, and the second time, I punched the kid in the throat. It wasn't a hard punch, but it was quickly determined, I hope unconsciously, that there were much easier targets to deal with. This makes me sound like some macho tough guy; I most certainly am not, unfortunately. If given the chance, I would have to define myself as an "introvert with a sullen demeanor that's actually polite" instead. 

I sat alone through school and didn't really make friends until 7th grade. Our second period was math. I'm not a genius, but I'm pretty hard-working, and the general inefficiency of the American school system, especially down there in the deeper parts of the South, allows for minimum effort with top grades. I would do my work quickly, and then I'd just read or draw something in the back for the last two-thirds of the class. I was drawing a picture of Hellboy on some notebook paper; I had just seen the Guillermo del Toro film when the principal walked in with a girl at his side. He called out to all of us:

"Hello everyone! This is Eliza, she'll be joining your class. She's new, *so be nice*."

He put some stank and an evil eye on that last part, and then he started talking about where she was from and how he knew she'd like our class and other stuff like that. She was already pretty tall, she had dry-looking, long, black, curly hair, there seemed to be bags under her eyes already, and she had a scar from a cleft lip. I saw some of the girls give each other a "she's gross and I'm trying to tell you I'm normal by visibly acting like she's gross" look while the principal was still talking. I think she saw this, but she didn't look embarrassed or sad; she just looked tired and resigned. Slowly, most of the other people in the class gave each other similar looks, but I still didn't. Then we looked at each other. There wasn't some sort of cheesy love look or blushing of the cheeks; we just locked eyes for a moment before I looked down and got back to drawing. 

Finally, the teacher got done yapping, and he walked out, leaving Eliza still standing in the doorway. The teacher gave her a moment before he said:

"Just sit down wherever."

She walked over to the seat in front of me and sat down. The teacher stood up, walked over, and handed Eliza the work we were doing.

"Help her with what we're doing today if she's behind, okay?"

"Yeah, no problem."

She wasn't behind; I suppose her old school had higher benchmarks because she told me she was working on the stuff we were doing a year ago in her sixth-grade class. She burned through the sheet of basic geometry in 10 minutes before turning around to talk to me some more.

"Is that Hellboy?"

"Yeah, I saw the movie last night with my Mom."

"That's nice! My dad took me to it a couple of days ago."

"Did you like it?"

"Yeah! It was kind of gross, though."

I laughed.

"Yeah, but I think that's part of the point for some people."

We went on talking about movies, then bands, then food, and so on for the rest of class. Our shared love of metal and bad movies made us friends quickly. I could tell a lot of great stories that we had through the short remainder of middle school up till a couple of months before the end of our senior year, but that's not really what this story is about. We never had any sort of relationship beyond being friends, and we both never dated anyone throughout the rest of our time in school, but I like to think near the end there were some signs of a blossoming relationship, but now I'll never know.

We had a lot of shared hobbies, again the love of similar media, but we also both liked to read, though I was much more of a fantasy guy, and we both loved exploring. Originally, it was just walking through the woods, but around early junior year, we took to exploring the unending supply of abandoned buildings around our area.

This was actually a pretty regular pass time in our town. There wasn't much in our area in the way of hangout spots and fun stuff to do, so it was pretty much either bowling, playing games at home, or wandering around. It was somewhat stigmatized by the police; some of us "explorers" had taken to keeping a close watch on the obituary pages and local word on who'd recently died. After that, they'd break in and ransack the house before families came to collect the deceased's belongings. Me and Eliza never took to that, but I guess the attraction of untouched life savings and perhaps a lesser feeling of guilt because the person's already dead got to some people. But, for the most part, all of us stuck to actual abandoned buildings.

We started with seriously decrepit spots; there's lots of old barns, I mean like 50+ years old, scattered around for people too nervous for old houses to start with, but we quickly got over that and started into some of the more interesting places. We checked out an old chapel with a basement with a bunch of old church documents, a small abandoned paper mill, the two abandoned Dennys, and various abandoned houses. We even went to a notorious trailer where a woman got murdered by two meth heads. It was all really fun, and we got a lot of great Polaroids and b roll horror footage out of it.

As I said, the cops weren't the happiest with this pass time, but they had other problems, and as long as we didn't cause any actual issue for them, they left it alone. However, there was one place that was not effectively forbidden. It was some old office building-looking place; we'd snuck down there to see it once, and it didn't have an official name. The cops just told us, "Stay away from that building a couple of miles back behind the old chapel, alright?" They always seemed to say that in such a cryptic and serious way. In the absence of a title, it came to be called Tartarus. A bit cheesy, I know, but its name was effective for creeping out middle schoolers and freshmen.

One of my buddies, Larry, said he went in there once. He told me he took one step in, heard some odd noises, and got the hell out of there. He said, "I don't know, man, something was wrong with that place." Even though Larry was a sleepy pothead, that pushed us to stay away for a while. 

By the end of our senior year, Eliza and I decided we weren't going to college to waste thousands of dollars just to have no guarantee we could get a job we'd probably hate. We decided we were both going to the local trade school, a decision that both our parents supported. They let us know they'd put us through it as long as we had jobs and paid some rent. With all this in mind, we both realized that we probably wouldn't have time for exploring as much if we weren't already tired by the end of classes and shifts, not to mention we were both turning 18 soon and would lose much of the leniency of the local police and court system for trespassing. Therefore, Eliza started talking about one last trip to Tartarus.

I remember us sitting at lunch talking about it over a week before. There we were, like normal, at the back corner of the lunch room, where small groups of people like us sat. By this time, we'd both gotten a bit more used to social interaction, and we were on good terms with most of the other "cliques" in school; we even went to some parties here and there, but we still preferred being a quiet duo. At the right end of the table were the "hackers," kids who thought logging onto the dark web to order LSD and phishing their way into the principal's email made them hackers, and on the left end were the back-backwoods kids, if you know what I mean.

Eilza'd gotten even taller, the scar on her lip had faded, but it was still there, and she looked even more tired for some reason, but she was always upbeat. I miss her so much now.

"I don't know, Eliza, we've already gotten our share of the urban exploration thrill; maybe we should just let it go or visit some of the old spots one more time."

"Yeah, you're probably right, but it just sounds so cool. What if we just went into the lobby like Larry did? If something's up, we'll bail."

We went back and forth like this for the rest of that lunch period and for a couple more after, finally:

"Alright, well, if we're both carrying our knife and you've got your pepper spray, I'm in, but seriously if somethings weird, we leave, alright?"

"Yeah, of course!"

And then we were there, in my run-down truck, just a half mile from Tartarus.

The walk there was uneventful from what I remember, but we both remarked how, just like when we came to just look at the building, there were no noises from animals or birds, and it was just a couple hours past noon still. That already made me try to convince Eliza to turn back with me.

"Well, maybe a wolf pissed nearby or something, it's probably normal, right? Again, we're just gonna check out the lobby. Come on!"

Basically, you come out of dense trees straight into an oval-shaped clearing with this small office building on its back edge. The rest of the clearing in front of the entrance has no trees, but the grass does get somewhat grown up. We assumed that every once in a while, the police must've trimmed it down when they came out to inspect it, or maybe, being government property, they still had to keep up with it some here and there.

We walked up, and I tried the door with a knot slowly forming in my stomach. It wasn't locked or anything; it opened, and inside was a dusty front lobby. There was a large wooden receptionist desk, moldy cushioned chairs, and a dead rat in the corner. That sounds simple, sure, but I quickly understood what Larry meant. The atmosphere was dense; it felt that as soon as I entered, my vision had just slightly condensed somehow, and there was this horrible quiet stillness. Also, I could just barely pick it up, but I smelled something. Something odd. It wasn't strong enough to describe at that point, but it definitely wasn't a good smell. Eliza broke the silence.

"I get what Larry means."

"Yeah, I know."

We meandered there in the lobby, looking around cautiously and opening the desk drawers for a long time. But Eliza was too curious.

"Well, it feels weird in here, but I still want to see a little more."

She asked me to come along with a look.

"There's not even gonna be anything here, though. It's unique, yeah, but it's just some more dusty space-"

"Exactly! There's nothing special here, so we'll just go up a floor, look around for a second, and then head out."

"No, Eliza, let's just go."

As she would sometimes do, she ignored me and acted as though I'd agreed. She started walking towards the hallway behind the receptionist's desk.

"I'm out of here. Good luck!"

Sometimes I would hold myself to ditching her like that if she was being this way, but she called my bluff this time. No one should explore an abandoned building alone. Still, I tried to make it sound real. I shuffled around loudly in one of the side rooms we hadn't looked into, and then I loudly tried the front door to sound like I was leaving. I say tried because it wouldn't move. Between the double doors was a slight gap which the sunlight was peering out of; between the gap, I could see that something was stuck either on or between the two handles outside, and by how little the door would give, it was something solid. It hadn't been there before.

I was exploding with stress in an instant, but I kept calm. You have to, especially in dangerous environments. I quickly went to the window beside the front entrance; when it wouldn't open, I picked up one of the chairs and threw it at it. It was hard plexiglass. It wasn't gonna break that easily. I turned around and made my way down the hallway Eliza had gone down.

We'd been in similar situations like this before; we'd explored too far into a part of the old chapel that was hard to get into and even harder to get out of, and once, we'd even encountered a homeless junkie. Through these situations, and others like it, I learned that you can't freeze; you have to keep moving and keep thinking no matter how badly your muscles are seizing up from stress. I must've looked kind of funny, if not also a bit alarming, as I speed walked down the hall with a deadpan face save for wide-open eyes.

She wasn't on the bottom floor or in the little side rooms and offices beside the stairs. I wanted to call out to her, but I felt too afraid to break the silence. Finally, she called out to me.

"John?"

I could tell there was fear in her voice, and she'd gotten quieter. I climbed the stairs and made my way to the break room she was in. She was in the doorway. When I'd gotten over and peered my head into the room, my stress nearly doubled. There was some sort of ritualistic circle on the floor. The window of the break room was broken open, not big enough to squeeze out of, and it was still a plexiglass window, and a breeze was flowing in. The circle was drawn with salt, and the breeze was gently and slowly, ruining the circle. In the middle was an eye with odd lines drawn around it, like tentacles or like the lines kids draw on the sun. On the perimeter of the circle were candles, and there had to have been a hundred of them lining it. I didn't count, but the circles started being lit at 12:00 and ended somewhere around 6:15.

I was still behind Eliza, still in the doorway, peering over her shoulder. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement. I looked over. For just a second, I saw someone, or something in hindsight, looking out of one of the offices down the hall. It looked like a person, but they were wearing a mask, a very tight mask. The mask only had eye holes, and it appeared to have been made from the mismatched pelts of various animals, but behind that mask, I saw wide dead eyes staring straight through me before they slid out of view from the open door.

I looked around frantically for any other signs of danger. I was so stressed by this point I felt sick, and that odd smell had gotten much stronger now. 

"Did you see that?"

"See what?"

"Someone was down the hall."

She paused for a moment before shifting out of the doorway and turning towards the stairs, grabbing my arm to pull me with her. I pulled back.

"The front door's been barred, and the windows won't break."

Eliza was tense before, but now she was frozen. What could be done? There was no exiting, we didn't have phones, and there was someone, someone wrong, here in the building with us. The only thing I worked out in my head was that we'd have to find this guy, and since he was probably the one who barred the entrance, we could get him to show us another exit.

"Look, do you still have your pepper spray?"

"Yes."

"Get it out. I got my knife. We'll be alright. Whoever locked us in can get us out; we just gotta go confront him, c'mon."

We were both afraid, but again, we'd been through stressful situations before, and I guess she knew I was right. We started walking down the hall together towards the side office I'd seen their head pop out of. Unfortunately, it was not a side office. It was a staircase. After a moment of hesitation, we headed down. Measuring levels by the height of the stairs leading to the second floor from earlier, we must've gone down three more levels past the first floor. There were other floors on each level, but their doors were caved in with rubble. The bottom floor really gave credence to the name Tartarus.

The atmosphere was even denser. My vision seemed even more processed and slightly red, and the smell, God, the smell. It was strong enough to be recognized now, but it's not possible to describe it. All I need to say is that it was completely foreign and nauseating. 

It was, just like the second floor, a hallway with little side rooms. This floor was not illuminated by the bright sunlight outside and the multiple windows. Instead, there were buzzing fluorescent lights overhead. At the back of the hallway was what looked like at the time: an office with frosted glass windows. When we opened our door, the office's door closed.

There seemed to be little other choice. I did think about going back and trying to claw my way through the plexiglass with my knife, but this seemed like a faster, more direct option. We started walking down the halls. Most of the side rooms were old server rooms, with dusty metal cabinets full of archaic computers, archaic for 2004, but some of the side rooms were simply black pits of darkness. For all we could see, they could have gone back 10 yards or 10 miles.

About halfway through, that level's door closed, and the hollow metal chunk echoed painfully loudly through the hall and down those dark rooms and much farther than I would have liked it to. I still didn't see any other option, especially when we heard a small click from the door's lock, so we just kept going towards the office. When I was finally standing in front of it, my hand just a few inches from the knob, my vision felt so distorted it was like a red magnified screen had been placed over them, the smell was so powerful I could barely stand it, and there was an alternating hum in my ears. 

"Don't, John."

Eliza's voice was barely even a whisper. But it was too late; I was here now, and I almost felt compelled to, and I suppose I may have been, in hindsight. Maybe I was going to open that door no matter what.

It was a rusty and empty room. The floor was either bare concrete or covered in dirt. At the end of it was an odd metal door, or hatch really, with a loose chain attached to it at the top. At the very back left corner of the room was a ladder leading into a trap door to another level; at the top of the ladder, I saw a man's legs.

"Hey!"

I ran forward to try to climb up and catch him. When I had gotten halfway there, and after Eliza had followed me just enough to get out of the doorway, the legs quickly disappeared up the closing hatch, and the office door slammed shut behind us. 

It's hard to describe how I felt. I can tell you all about how I froze and how my throat felt dry and all that, but it won't relay how horrible I felt. I never got a word from Eliza about how she felt at that moment. We were trapped, and figures were now collecting behind the frosted glass windows. Many figures of many different shapes and sizes. Most seemed human, but some didn't seem to have the right shape. I don't mean just a missing arm; I swear that, admittedly, through a frosted glass window, I saw some of them with missing heads, with impossibly crooked spines, and a couple were rotund in anatomically inaccurate ways, at least for one person. However, this is all beside the point now. The chain had begun to lift.

I looked over at Eliza; she seemed 10 years older with all the stress on her face. She was crying, there were stress lines across her face that wouldn't look out of place on a 90-year-old, and she was hyperventilating. I ran over to try and comfort her, but then the chain tightened, and the metal hatch had begun to lift.

Somehow, the smell had intensified once again, and there was some horrible noise that was coming out from behind the hatch. It was like a moan from some animal that can't exist, like some ungodly mix between a goat, an alligator, and a cat, and intermixed with the moan were the distorted and weak cries or screams of different people.

After the hatch was halfway up, I saw it coming out of the darkness. Imagine a large eye; I can't compare it to any animal's eye you'd know in a mass of sickly green flesh. Surrounding the eye on the rest of the body were human heads morphed into the flesh. They were all crying or screaming. Some of them warned us to get away, and some of them begged for help, but most didn't even seem able to speak. I'm sorry, but I'm not comfortable describing it in any more detail. It's already been too much to write that.

It was coming towards us faster than it should have been able to without legs. We both panicked when it was just a few feet from us. I ran to the left, and she ran to the right. That was the only difference. It decided on her, for some reason, and she was cornered. Eliza started screaming.

"JOHN, HELP ME!!! OH GOD!!!"

The hatch was still open. I heard her scream when it finally had her, and I ran down the tunnel it came out of. I heard her screaming for me to come back and not to leave her there, but I just kept running. I heard her yells echoing for a long time. I think it was a long time. It felt like I was in that cave for hours.

It's all like a fever dream now, but I remember hearing these odd noises around me. I kept stepping on something soft and wet, only to hear it cry out, similar to how the monster had. The cave was thin, and, thank God, there was no light for me to see anything around me or to see where I was going, so I just kept my hand on the wall beside me while I kept running. I stumbled over these small masses of otherworldly flesh and over rocks until I saw the light.

I had come to the end of the cave, and I was standing in its large opening. I remember there being an altar, a worn-down stone altar with the iconography of the monster and the circle I saw earlier. There was one depiction of the eye, bare and covered with flames, falling out of the sky, but there was another one, now covered in more heads than it was covered in when I encountered it, and its eye was projecting some portal or rift, and there were winged eyes flying and small headless cat-like creatures coming out of it, but behind them was something large, and its skeletal seven fingered hand was reaching of the portal.

Now that I think about it, it was still daylight outside, so I couldn't have been running through the cave for too long. Again, it's all still like a blur, getting down the little hill the cave was housed in, going towards the road I'd seen in the distance from the cave's head, and having the police called on a freaked out and dirty teenager on the side of the road just aren't memorable details considering what had just happened.

I wish I could tell you about some sort of closure to this horror, but I don't have anything of the sort for you. I told the police what had happened, every detail of it. It wasn't like they gaslighted me or brushed me off or something. They just lied and knew I knew. They came to the house one day, talked to my parents in private, and then sat me down and told me Eliza had died falling through the floor, exploring Tartarus. When I argued, the officers simply got up and left without saying another word. My parents made me let it go, but they never told me what the officers had said to them, and these days, I'm not sure I'll ever bother to ask. And I haven't heard from Eliza's parents at all. She never even had a funeral. 

I still think about her. I pray she's dead or perhaps that I was hallucinating, but I fear that she's still down there. Screaming and crying with all the others. 

I'm sorry, Eliza, but I'm not going back.

I'm not joining you.

I'm not stepping another foot in an abandoned building ever again.

Forgive me.
