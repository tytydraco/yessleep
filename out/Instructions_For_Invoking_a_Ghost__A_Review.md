The instructions were quite expensive, and we had no reason to believe they were nothing but a scam. Jay had been insistent though, and I guess it was something different than just a regular 30th birthday party. 



Besides me and Jay, Andrew and Ed also chipped in–so it was fifty bucks a person. So two-hundred bucks altogether for a set of instructions on how to call upon and invoke a ghost at a nearby cemetery–tailored specifically for it, and with guaranteed success. It sounded dumb, but Jay seemed convinced about the whole thing.



He said that the website where he got it wasn’t exactly legal. It was from the dark web. Apparently you could buy drugs and 3D-printed guns from the same website. And because of that, it was virtually impossible to fake reviews–anyone lying over there would be taken down very quickly it seemed. And this guy had hundreds of reviews, all positive, lots with explicit details about their experiences. When Jay read some to us, they did sound legit.



Of course, it still also sounded dumb.



The instructions, once we got them, were detailed, specific, and quite well laid out. The whole document was nearly fifty pages long, so Jay just shared with us the relevant pages. For example, there were some preparations we all had to do at home during the week previous to the invocation. These included saging the house every day before the sun went down, meditating for at least five minutes each day while imagining a golden ball of protection around yourself, as well as eating relatively healthy and not using alcohol or other drugs. 



It was all very hippy-dippy, but I still did it. If I was paying money for this thing, that was enough reason to give it a real try. Besides, Jay was insistent that we didn’t cheat on any preparations. It was a tall order, but as far as I know, we all did what was asked. To be honest, I kind of learned to like it. It was simply a healthier lifestyle packaged as ritual preparation, which was kind of a genius marketing strategy. I thought that I might even keep some of these habits going after.



During the preparation week, Jay made sure to remind everyone about what to do through a group chat we’d set up. Around sunset he’d shoot a message about the sage, asked about our plans (making sure we weren’t going to parties or anything to drink) and so on. Andrew and Ed didn’t reply with much more than reaction emojis, but I tried to keep the conversation going, posting little updates here and there. Otherwise I’d have felt bad for Jay basically just talking to himself.



I still wonder why we went along with it. The reason is probably as simple and boring as obligation: as friends, we’d known each other forever. Been there for each others’ stuff, even if it wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea.



Jay had always been interested in weird shit. Not even necessarily occult stuff, as you might think, but just anything out of the ordinary. His favorite hobby was blind-buying tickets for local events, then showing up without any real idea what he was showing up for. And of course he wanted to do something weird for his 30th, and it gave him an excuse to drag his friends along, which we were more-or-less happy to oblige. For what it’s worth, Ed had dragged us to Florida for his 30th, wherein we spent a week getting hammered in the swamps. Jay didn’t complain, even if it was obvious he got very bored after the first day when he realized that there wasn’t much more to be done except… drink, day in, day out.



Soon it was just two days to do. The instructions made it clear that the final day’s preparations were more important than anything else. Well, besides the ritual itself, of course. During that day we all had to fast after midday, and not eat anything until the next day’s sunrise. Water was fine, thankfully, but when we gathered at the cemetery gates around sundown, everyone besides Jay was a bit cranky. Jay was happy, I think, because judging by our crankiness, we’d all actually been fasting the whole day. 



As we went in, Jay gave each of us a flashlight. They were to be put on *only* when the sun was fully behind the horizon. Jay made small-talk as we walked around, waiting for the sun to go down. Everyone else seemed ready to get this over with. Even I was quite tired by that point, and as Jay went on and on about how exciting this would be, I just thought about what kind of fast food I’d want to get on my way back home.



Once the sun was gone, leaving only faint trails of red that slowly dripped into the darkness, Jay clicked on his flashlight, and we followed suit. There’d been a couple people around before, but now it was dead quiet. The darkness was something I hadn’t felt before, as my eyes had been adjusting to it ever so slowly, but the cone of light that the flashlight threw beyond made the contrast all the more stark.



Suddenly I felt nervous, and I could tell Ed and Andrew did as well. Just like that, it was real. It was about to happen. Jay was smiling ear-to-ear, completely in his element. I think he enjoyed it a bit to see us squirm.



He led us to the center of the cemetery, where wildflowers bloomed in an odd almost-circle. To our left was a mausoleum, one of the few in the cemetery. It had neither plaque nor insignia, although it looked as old as anything around. 



Jay turned to us, and said “So, everyone ready?”



We nodded and turned off our flashlights. The darkness had grown, and the air felt colder than before. The moon was not of much help, as it was shrouded in gray clouds like smoke. I recounted in my head once more what the instructions had said. I’m sure Ed and Andrew did the same.



We faced the mausoleum. Jay began the ritual by speaking out loud his excerpt, which I won’t share here. Then he clicked his flashlight on, drew a circle of light around the mausoleum, and clicked it off. Ed’s turn was next, and he stepped forward as Jay retreated.



Ed’s excerpt was in latin, and he whispered it. He then clicked his flashlight on, drew the circle, and clicked it off.



Andrew was next. His breath was not calm. His hand seemed a bit shaky. That was not good, but I didn’t say anything. It was imperative that we followed the instructions just as they had been written–Jay had been very clear about that. I glanced over at him, but I couldn’t see his face too well in the darkness, although I could feel the tension in the air. 



Andrew spoke his excerpt slowly, each word careful and thought out. It was an agonizing few minutes, in that with each word I thought he’d have forgotten the next, but somehow he pulled through. He even sighed with relief as he lifted up his flashlight.



When he clicked it, there was no light. Everything went quiet as we held our breaths.



*Click*



Nothing. Andrew’s breath shot out like his lungs had been punched.



*Click. Click. Clickclickclick…*



It wouldn’t turn on. We all turned to look at Jay. He’d told us not to interfere with each other's parts. No talking, no touching, no nothing. That’s how it was supposed to go. What was the protocol now, then? Could one of us lend him a flashlight?



Jay’s eyes glistened in the darkness, wide and scared.



“What do we do?” Ed whispered.



A high-pitched scream came from inside the mausoleum.



Jay jumped back. “No, no, *nonono…*”



Andrew turned around. He was hyperventilating. Something had gone terribly wrong, and it all felt like we were just waiting to figure out what that something was. Jay hadn’t shared anything about possible repercussions, so I guess I just assumed that there wouldn’t be any.



Andrew spoke. “What do I–”



An invincible energy moved between us as his tongue was ripped from his mouth and made a thud as it fell to the ground. His eyes went wide as he screamed through a spit-blood gurgle. 



“RUN!” Jay shouted and took off. Me and Ed stared at Andrew, unable to take our eyes off him. Too much in shock to help, or to run.



The seconds dragged on until something snapped in my mind. It was time to do something. Anything. I turned to Ed.



“Let’s go!”



His neck twisted towards me as his body stayed still. Bones cracked. He clicked on his flashlight, illuminating Andrew, who was now holding his tongue in his hand, crouched on the ground, crying and screaming and dripping red mucus on his clothes. Scared like a lamb.



“Be thankful,” Ed said with a voice like wet gravel. “You didn’t touch the light. Keep your words inside for now.”



He launched himself towards Andrew, pulling his head back. With eerie precision, showed the flashlight into Andrew’s throat, twisting it like a screw to fit as it bulged out his throat, dislocating his adam’s apple. Teeth cracked and came loose in the process of fitting the thick end inside his mouth. He couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t cough. Ed let go. Andrew convulsed and flailed, painting the sky with the light of his death emanating from his mouth.



Somewhere I heard a scream. Ed ran toward it. I stopped and stared to watch my friend, maimed and disfigured, slowly die. 



Snaps, whooshes and screams flew around the cemetery. I didn’t look. I simply stood, waiting for it to stop. I don’t know how long it took to do so.



When it finally did, with cold, shaking legs I made my way towards the exit. High above, in the branches of an old maple tree, were Ed and Jay’s bodies, dripping blood from where bones had broken through the skin. Their eyes were gouged out, like yolks spread upon the hungry earth, the holes remaining dark red like wine.



The sun was coming up, painting the horizon a golden yellow. Soon there’d be people around. I was hungry. My friends were dead.



I left the cemetery. I left my friends there. I changed my contact information, and a few months later I moved out of state once my lease was up.



I talked to the cops. They didn’t like me,m but they had no evidence I’d done it. Ed’s wife found each new number I got and called to scream at me. Jay’s mom begged me to tell her anything.



There was nothing I could offer. I am now the empty promise of Jay’s 30th trip around the sun, personified. I am empty and without answers. There’s no rhyme or reason to what they went through. I just wish that no one else needs to go through the same thing. But I don’t know if that’s possible. I don’t know if it helps to write any of this out. There’s no coming back. No place I could go where I wouldn't remember the things I saw that night. No drug that could erase the shame and fear and responsibility I feel.



I keep a flashlight around. I don’t know why. I click it off and on, checking to see if at some point it wouldn’t turn on. There’s no answers there, but there is a connection. I know nothing of what it means. I don’t wish to.



I wish something came to save [me](https://wintersnoah.wordpress.com).
