So, you may be thinking "Why cant we go in the woods alone hunters go there!" Its safer not to go in the woods, so you wont encounter what lurks in there.

I lived in a very quiet town, not much things happen there, it was pretty peaceful.

One time I decided to go hunting cause I wanted to pick it up as a hobby, I started hunting like it was an everyday thing, I even made friends. One time my friends decided to dare me to go hunting at night all alone. I decided to agree cause they kept pushing me, anyway here is when It starts to get serious. So it was a dark night, pretty quiet knowing it was a sunday night making it a school night. everyone had work in the morning, alot of people had school typical stuff. It was 10:35 PM, I was exploring thinking nothing could go wrong.

It was 12:00, and i still haven't found anything. It was 2 AM I decided to just go home and go hunting in the morning, but i heard something very unusual, I didn't recognize it. I soon found a cave. but i decided not to go cause i was really scared. I tried leaving but as soon as I left i saw a very large shadowy creature with horns. Its face looked like a skull not just one, there was multiple around me. I felt so scared i couldn't even move.

I dropped my rifle as i trembled in fear. They were getting closer and closer.

I managed to run away but they were fast, very fast. I couldn't outrun them so I decided to hide in a bush hoping I wouldn't be found. I was so scared i couldn't move a single muscle. I fell asleep. I woke up in the morning and i ran to my car.

2 weeks later i decided to return t o that same cave, searching. I was searching for hours for those creatures, It was night again, I decided to leave and go next time, but as soon as I did I saw them, I quickly took out my camera to take pictures, And I grabbed my rifle and opened fire. It was doing nothing so I decided I would just run. of course i couldn't outrun them so i decided to hide in another bush and suprisingly it worked, I woke up and it was morning again, I decided to look at the pictures and keep them.

I was driving back home and then I taped the pictures i took to the wall.

I decided to go back a third time with a squad, we were prepared. With night vision modern weapons and everything, We were desperate to take them down as they are to dangerous for them to live. We searched for hours and we found them. We saw what they looked like and we were shocked. It didn't have a face. It was completely black with red glowing eyes. It looked like it was smiling at us, We quickly opened fire and then we brang out better weapons, they decided to retreat but we followed them, They ran into the mysterious cave but we followed them, Only to be suprised on what we saw will haunt me to this day.

We saw hundreds of those shadowy creatures living in that mysterious cave.

One of our squad members said, So this is where the live.

We decided to open fire and they were cornered, but they decided to fight back so we had to use flamethrowers, They seemed to be scared of the flamethrowers because of the light its creating.

Squad Member 1: So thats their weakness.

Squad member 2: Everybody use your flamethrowers now!

We all used our flamethrowers and the cave lit up, They were terrified of the light, we got closer and closer until all of the creatures started shouting in pain and melted into nothing, it was just like it just dissapeared and was no where to be found, One by one we kept going until a taller shadowy creature came in that wasn't terrified of the light the flamethrowers were creating. We were horrified, it took us down one by one, but luckily only one died. we got away but we decided to never go back to that cave or ever go back in the woods.

Weeks later the remaining squad members and I left the country, We all live together and we decided to never talk about what we saw ever again.

To this day we are still traumatized to what we saw.
