I needed a job—badly. When I found a listing for a **“Night Clerk – $50/hr, Easy Work”**, I didn’t ask too many questions. The ad was vague: monitor the front desk, follow the guidelines. That was it. No experience required. No background checks. It sounded too good to be true, but desperation makes you ignore red flags.

I showed up for my first shift at **11:45 PM** to a nondescript office building on the edge of town. The lobby was sterile—white walls, tile floors, a desk with an old CRT monitor. The only person there was a short, pale man with hollow eyes and a pressed gray suit. He handed me a single sheet of paper, his expression unreadable.

**"Follow these rules exactly,"** he said, voice flat. **"And whatever you do, don’t break them."**

I laughed, thinking he was joking. He wasn’t.

# THE RULES:

1. The phone will ring at midnight. **Do not answer it.**
2. If the elevator doors open on their own, **do not look inside.**
3. You may hear typing from the empty office at the end of the hall. **Ignore it.**
4. If you hear knocking on the front door, check the monitor first. **If there’s nothing there, do not open it.**
5. The man in the security uniform will come in at 2:16 AM. **Do not speak to him.**
6. If you find a sticky note with your name on it, **burn it immediately.**
7. The vending machine sometimes dispenses items you didn’t select. **Do not eat anything you didn’t order.**
8. If the lights flicker, close your eyes and count to 30. **Do not open them before.**
9. You must clock out at exactly 6:00 AM. **Not a minute before. Not a minute after.**
10. If you realize you’ve broken a rule, **hide immediately.**

I was too tired to argue, so I took the list and settled behind the desk. At **midnight**, the phone rang, an old landline on the desk. Instinctively, my hand twitched toward it, but I caught myself. **Do not answer it.** The ringing stopped after three chimes.

At **12:47 AM**, a slow, rhythmic clicking came from the far end of the hall—the empty office. **Ignore it.** My fingers dug into my palms as I forced myself to keep my eyes on the screen. The typing **stopped** a few minutes later.

At **2:16 AM**, the security guard arrived. He walked in without acknowledging me, heading straight for the vending machine, standing stiffly in front of it. I avoided eye contact, but in the reflective glass, I caught a glimpse of his face—or lack thereof.

He had no features. Just smooth, blank skin where his eyes, nose, and mouth should be. I kept my gaze down. Eventually, he left. By **3:30 AM**, I had convinced myself the rules were just elaborate mind games. But then I saw it.

A **yellow sticky note** on my desk.

**My name was on it.**

My breath hitched. My hands trembled as I fumbled for the lighter in my pocket, flicking it on. The note curled black at the edges, turning to ash between my fingers. A sharp **knock** echoed through the lobby.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

I swallowed hard and checked the security monitor. The glass doors showed nothing but an empty parking lot.

**Do not open the door.**

I gripped the desk, knuckles white. The knocking stopped. My pulse slowed. But then I realized—I had broken Rule #6. I was supposed to burn the note **immediately**. I had hesitated. A cold wave of dread crashed over me.

**Hide immediately.**

I dove under the desk, heart pounding. The air felt thick, pressing against my skin. Silence rang in my ears, loud and suffocating. Then, footsteps. Slow. Deliberate. Circling the desk. I squeezed my eyes shut, barely breathing. A whisper drifted down to me.

**"You were doing so well."**

The footsteps stopped. I waited, paralyzed. **Minutes passed.** Maybe an hour. Finally, the air shifted. Whatever was there, it was gone.

At **5:59 AM**, I crawled out, shaking. My eyes locked onto the clock, waiting for **6:00 AM exactly** before punching out. As I stepped outside, the sun barely rising, I felt… different. Like something had changed. When I got home, I collapsed onto my bed, exhausted. My phone buzzed. A **new email.**

**"Second shift confirmed. 11:45 PM tonight."**

I never signed up for another shift. I tried to quit. Called the number from the job listing. No answer. Then I checked my bank account.

I had been paid. **Twice.**

Once for last night.

And once for tonight.

The money was already there. The job wasn’t over.

And I don’t think **I’m allowed to leave.**
