After getting home from that dreadful gig, I went straight to sleep.  Nightmares followed. When I woke up, I smelled French perfume – the same perfume worn by a certain redhead – on my pillows.
 
Nothing made sense. Part of me didn’t believe what had happened. Inferno? What kind of nightclub was that? I went online and did some research, but nothing was conclusive. My town is seedy – this is well known – but monsters? Really?
 
Actually, it kinda made sense. An awful lot of people go missing around here – sometimes violently – but no one says a peep. I thought it was the mafia. A monster mafia, perhaps?
 
The day was deplorable. I did everything I could to distract myself, to slow down time, but nothing helped. In a few short hours I was expected to return to the monster bar. I dreaded the thought. Reluctantly, I regarded the song list that the boss had given me. Songs like: Slow Train to Deathsville didn’t do much to comfort me. Same goes for: Crossroads after Dark, and The Devil Owns My Soul. These aren’t real songs, I told myself, after my ninth cup of coffee. The list was stupid. They were setting me up.
 
The day raced by. I nearly chickened out, but as six o'clock approached, I took an Uber to the nightclub; I wanted it on record where I was going. Just in case.
 
The club was darker than I’d remembered. And foul-smelling. The marble floor was sticky. Part of me was hoping for a miracle: that I’d be greeted by normal human beings. Heck, even cracked-out lowlifes would suffice. But that’s not what happened.
 
“Need anything, Hank?” the bartender asked in his bottomless voice. His skin was paper-pale, his dark hair slicked back. He really could pass for Dracula, only taller. No normal person could be that tall. 
 
I tried speaking, but nothing came out. He shrugged, and went about serving a bunch of lizard people who were gathered around the bar.
 
The grand piano greeted me with a groan. My heart was racing. Already, I was sweating. Stupid fireplace. If I see that redhead, I’m gonna….
 
What? What was I gonna do?
 
My mind was a blender. All these conflicting emotions surfaced. That a band of ogres were mocking me didn’t help. “What are you?” they shouted, “some kind of moron?” Someone in the back hollered, “He’s a penis, not a pianist!” To which another monster replied: “I guess size DOES matter!”
 
I shot out of my seat and raced to the bar. I was parched. Remembering how murky the tap water was, I asked for a chilled bottle. The bartender looked at me like I was food. Dinner, perhaps. He poured me a pint of weak-looking beer, then he resumed chatting with the lizards, who were licking their faces with long, sickly tongues.
 
I took a sip of beer, dreading what would happen next. Surely, I’d be poisoned. But hey, if I’m gonna die and have my head strung up on the wall, so be it. Let’s get this over with, shall we? The beer was warm, but other than that, it was fine. I breathed a sigh of relief, and sat down at the piano bench.
 
“Slow Train to Deathsville!” one of the trolls yelled, followed by a chorus of chuckling.
 
“In the key of death!”
 
The monsters grew restless, smashing their mugs on the tables. A two-headed giant with teeth like hockey sticks was waving a butcher’s knife. I didn’t trust the look in his eyes. Clearly, he was a madman. The audience was growing rowdier by the minute. I was transfixed, unable to move. They were so ugly, it was incomprehensible. 
 
“Didn’t ya mamma tell ya it’s rude to stare?” someone shouted over the noise.
 
“We should slow-torture him.”
 
“Like the last guy!”
 
Clearly, they meant business. The barroom walls were lined with severed heads, after all. Probably, musicians. Like me. I took a deep breath, and gathered my nerves. When my shaky hands touched the piano keys, I shrieked. The keys were bones. A beer whizzed over my head, and shattered. More insults were slung. 
 
A grim looking ghoul approached me, slow and deliberate. It looked like a zombie: dead on the outside, mean-spirited on the inside. The zombie’s eyes were tiny slits of murder, its hands clutching a cleaver. My mind went blank. Suddenly, I’d forgotten every song I’d learned: it was like I’d never touched a piano in my life. Moments before the zombie could slice my head off and hang it on a mantle, a giant boom blasted throughout the barroom.
 
The redhead appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. With her was the big, bald-headed boss. The same boss who turned into a dragon the previous night. Same boss who handed me a list of songs that don’t exist. Not in this world, anyhow.
 
“QUIET!” the redhead hollered, standing in the middle of the dancefloor.
 
The room shushed.
 
“Let Hank play.”
 
She wore a long, flowing nightgown that left little to the imagination. Her luscious lips matched her fiery hair. She turned to me and my heart melted. She strutted towards a nearby table and sat with a bunch of ogres the size of football stadiums. The zombie – now within striking distance – frowned. It lowered its weapon, and plopped down at the nearest table, but its soulless eyes never left mine.
 
The monsters – fifty, perhaps – were staring at me. Drops of drool splashed across their filthy faces. I groaned. So did my stomach. The beer wasn’t sitting well with me. This is it, I realized, do or die. I closed my eyes, and launched into the Adam’s Family theme, figuring they’d either love it, or they’d kill me. Their response was meek, at best. Jeesh. Tough crowd. As I sang Die With A Smile, by Lady Gaga, the doors burst open.
 
Everyone turned.
 
A gang of ghouls entered, carrying a vast array of weapons: guns that looked like relics from the Civil War. They were lizard people, similar to the ones sitting at the bar. They were hairless creatures; their skin was sickly green with a tinge of yellow, and they wore matching cowboy hats and boots. Their attire was ridiculous, like a band of psychobillies. 
 
Their leader leapt onto a table and ordered everyone to shut up. “Where’s Tony?” he shouted, his voice sounding like AI.
 
Nobody spoke.
 
A grotesque grin stretched across his leathery lips. His tongue was forked, like a snake, and his eyes were on the side of his head.
 
“Maybe y’all didn’t hear me?” He kicked the drinks off the table. “Maybe y’all are too STUPID!”
 
The redhead (I still hadn’t learned her name) and her boss vanished. The trolls started trembling, the ogres snorting soggy tears. I grimaced. There’s nothing less satisfying than being surrounded by a pack of scared-to-death monsters.
 
The gang leader tipped his cowboy hat. Then he leapt off the table and ran towards the bar. “Ivan!” he shouted at the bartender. “Fix us some drinks, why don’t ya? Got a feeling we’re gonna be here for a while.”
 
Nobody spoke. The only sound was the bartender preparing drinks.
 
I slouched as low as possible, trying to make myself invisible.
 
A henchman stood up, and everyone turned. “You gonna pay for them?” The henchmen puffed out his chest. He was huge, twice the size of the leathery lizards. The henchman approached the intruders; he was carrying an axe which looked razor-sharp.
 
“Tough guy, eh?” the leader said. “Yeeha!” He fired a blast into the ceiling. Many monsters hit the ground.
 
The intruders – six of them, I believe, but it’s difficult to say because they were going in and out of focus – surrounded the henchman. The lizard people sitting at the bar joined them, guns drawn.
 
With remarkable speed, the henchman swung his axe. The leader ducked, but not quick enough. His hat flew off, and his olive head rolled along the dancefloor, stopping at my feet. 

The lifeless lizard’s body collapsed into a pool of blood. 
 
The intruders open-fired. Bullets whizzed. More blood was spilled. I slid underneath the piano, scared out of my mind. The cowpoke’s head was staring at me, glossy eyed and dripping with gooey black slime.
 
Monsters were stabbing and killing and screeching and quarrelling. The sound was tremendous, like a warzone. Those leather-clad lizards zipped along the walls like trained assassins, shooting the monsters point blank. A pixie’s head exploded with fireworks of blood. A troll's eyes were shot out; a grumble of maggots ejected from the soggy sockets. Its towering body tumbled onto the table, which broke in half.  
 
The baldheaded boss reappeared out of nowhere; he spoke in a strange language. Suddenly, gas sifted out of the walls. So, this is how I die, I remember thinking: poisoned to death.
 
The gas filled the room.
 
The boss transformed into a dragon; he spat furious flames. The flames mixed with the gas, creating a giant explosion. Shrieks of terror filled the barroom. The entire gang of ghouls perished. Monsters melted and moaned. The smell was atrocious, like a rotten egg factory burning down. Everyone died, except the boss, the redhead, and Ivan, the bartender. And little ol’ me, of course, who was hiding next to a blood-leaking lizard’s brain.
 
What followed next was a silence so thick, you could stab it with a fork. I didn’t dare move from my hiding spot. The blood-soaked dancefloor was teeming with hapless corpses so vile and disgusting, it’s impossible to describe. Tables were torn to shreds. Drinks spilled. Glasses shattered. Flashes of fire flickered. Blood was dripping from the ceiling, which was over sixteen-feet high. Miraculously, the piano was unscathed.
 
“Well,” the boss said, wiping black goop from his slacks, “that was fun.” 

His bootheels clicked as he approached the piano bench; they sounded like bombs. 

“Hank,” he spat, “hand me that head, why don’t you?”
 
I gulped.
 
“And pick yourself up!” He kicked the piano. “This is a classy joint.”
 
The head was as heavy as a horse. It looked like a giant, inflated football covered in gore. My hands were crimson and cold. I was crying. 
 
“Oh, Hank,” the redhead said in a lonesome voice. “Play us a song. Something happy.”
 
“Slow Train to Deathsville,” the boss snapped.
 
Oh, how I hated that song.
 
The boss ordered a cleanup, and to my surprise, the kitchen crew sprang from the back room and got to work. Speedily, they hauled the dead monsters away. Minutes later, a few stranglers walked in: a pair of shadow-creatures sat in the front row, where moments ago, a grim-faced ogre died. I didn’t bother taking a set break – I was way too scared – so I played every song I knew, starting with Folsom Prison Blues.
 
More monsters arrived. They started heckling me, but I barely noticed. I was stuck in Survival Mode. By nine o'clock, the place cleared out, and I ended my set with Maxwell’s Silver Hammer, by the Beatles. By now, the redhead is sitting next to me on the bench, purring like a cat. From my peripheral vision, she looked like a witch. Warts and all.
 
The barroom stank like death and alcohol. I desperately wanted to go home and shower. Get this grime off me. There was zero chance I was ever setting foot in this place again. Fool me once, as they say.
 
“Rough night!” Ivan said gleefully, as he wiped a glob of blood from a barstool. His teeth were stained red. His fingernails were extremely long and tobacco-colored.
 
A cold hand touched my shoulder. “Here ya go, Hank.” The boss handed me an envelope; it was lighter than the previous night. “You didn’t learn the songs on the list.” His bald head was bulging with veins.
 
“Those songs,” I said carefully, not wanting my anger to reach a boiling point, “don’t exist!” My legs were shaking.
 
Tony, the boss, shrugged. He turned, and kissed the redhead egregiously. His erection was poking from his fine-Italian slacks. The redhead seemed pleased by this, and grabbed it with both hands.
 
I felt sick to my stomach. Watching monsters make out was not on my TO DO list. As quietly as humanly possible, I edged towards the exit, pondering this horrific gig. The flight upstairs seemed like an eternity. I swear there were more stairs than before. I was out of breath when I reached the exit.
 
“No way I’m coming back,” I muttered to no one, as I left.
 
“Sure you are,” a shriveled voice replied.
 
I stopped dead in my tracks.
 
“If you don’t,” the severed head said, gazing down at me from above the door. “You’ll end up like [me!”](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)
