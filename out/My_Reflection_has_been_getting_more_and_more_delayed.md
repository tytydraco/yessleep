About a year ago I had my big breakthrough, see I’ve been working in finance for a good while at this point, but with me coming from a small town, the most I spent my time with was handling taxes for the local grocer. Then I got a job offer, big bold letters in my email I honestly thought was a scam at first “Come to New York! Work for our firm!” with a phone number stabled at the bottom of the email. Long story short, it wasn’t a scam, I had made it. I waved goodbye to my small, little city, and I wanted to live it up, so I took out a loan and got myself a beautiful condo in a nice skyscraper. I was gonna be able to pay it off within the year with the kind of money I was going to make.

It was a beautiful home, sleek, white tile floor, open concept kitchen, and the bathroom, larger than my old living room. It was insane, and then when I got my first month's paycheck? I was over the moon, I went from a little nobody, small town nerd to big business man living in a condo popping bottles and wearing suits, it was like a real life Cinderella story.

Then it started happening. I noticed it one day while shaving in the mirror. I stood there, razor in hand and blinked, and I saw myself blink, I didn't notice it at first, the delay was so short.But I realized each time I blinked, I could see my eyelids, just for a split second, like my reflection opened my eyes after I did, I stood for a long time looking at it, staring at it and making sure I wasn’t going insane from stress or something, but no, I was 100% sure that what I was seeing was my own reflection delayed. It was fascinating, a barely noticeable little delay that had me almost captivated, for a while at least. The world moves on of course, I had responsibilities to take care of, a job to work and I couldn't stare at myself in the mirror all day.  
  
However it became sort of a ritual to wink at myself in the morning, seeing myself wink back was fun. But I also noticed, over time, that the delay got longer, slowly, but surely, it became more noticeable, I blinked and about a second later, the reflection of me would blink, it wasn’t much of a problem at first, until I started noticing this delay was for every mirror, it hadn’t been in the beginning but, one day I sat down in my car, ready to drive to work, adjusted the rearview mirror and about a second later the reflection adjusted with. That was a lot more trippy than simply seeing myself delayed, seeing a mirror switch positions, but the reflection only doing so after about a second. It also meant that it wasn’t my reflection that was delayed, but the mirror itself.  
  
As much as I loved my fancy, new car, I wasn’t about to go driving with a second delay on all my mirrors, that would be suicide, or at least a large bill, but seeing the other cars on the street made me realize very quickly that this was a uniquely me problem, clearly none of them were experiencing any reflection delays.  
  
Time passed on and I started zoning out the whole thing, it became more of a hassle to deal with than anything else. I had to resort to using my phone camera to shave, as recordings weren’t delayed for me, and I was tired of waiting for 5 minutes after entering the bathroom before my reflection finally decided to show up.

It wasn’t long before I started having at least some fun with it again. Could I get my morning routine done before my reflection even walked in? Of course that challenge got easier and easier as the days passed, over time I pretty much never caught my reflection, a single time it scared the shit out of me when I went to take a midnight piss and my reflection finally caught up to me entering to brush my teeth, but other than that it was a barely noticeable change, just something I had to get used to, a change to the daily life.

I came home from work, walked into my bathroom to take a piss when the door opened in my reflection too. Only about a second later, I thought for a moment that the delay had returned to a somewhat manageable amount, but the person that walked in wasn’t me. Whoever walked in was wearing a face mask, the medical kind, and sunglasses, as well as a beanie, pretty much obscuring their whole face, they searched through my drawers and my cabinets for about 5 minutes. Carefully too, making sure nothing was out of place before taking nothing and leaving the bathroom again.

I stood there for a long time, staring at the mirror, but the man didn’t return, about a million thoughts ran through my head all at once, and I quickly ran out of my bathroom to check the rest of my apartment if anything had been stolen, but nothing, it seemed the man had simply went into my condo, looking for something, and left. I checked my door, but there was no sign of forced entry. I lived in a skyscraper so there was no way they could have gotten in through the window.   
  
I have already contacted the police, and I am planning on getting cameras set up. I don’t know if it feels worse or better that nothing was stolen, but just the fact that someone was rummaging through my stuff gives me this icky feeling.
