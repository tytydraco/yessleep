I was awaken by the sound of the ceiling fan giving off a harsh clutch. I laid in bed peacefully, it had to be around 2 in the morning, the outside was still pitch dark. I stared at the ceiling fan, wanting to know where that sound came from exactly but it looked fine, spinning at a normal speed. I was too tired to even think at this time, I turned to my right side to fall back to sleep and I jolted when I saw that my son Christopher was standing right beside me by the bed, smiling, as if he was ready to start his day. 

“Christopher, what are you doing?”, I asked. 
He continued smiling. He had a look in his eyes like he was up to something. I was waiting for him to respond. 
“Christopher, I asked you a question”.
“Hi mom”, he replied. 
“Hi…, do you know what time it is, honey?

He just stood there smiling. I was bewildered at this point as to what he wanted. 

“Honey, you should go to bed”.
“I have someone who wants to meet you”, he said. 

I was confused. I had no idea what he was talking about. I stood up and turned on the lamp. Christopher had the largest eye bags and still wouldn’t let go of that smile. 

“Honey, have you been up all night, you look dead tired”

He giggled.

“Yes mom, I’ve been talking to Mr. Happy all night and he says he wants to meet you. We should grace his presence.”
I was starting to get terrified. My son is 6 years old and he doesn’t have anyone to talk to besides me. I tried brushing it off. I got out of bed, grabbed his right hand and walked him back to his room. I put him back in his bed and tucked him in. He still had that smile on him. 

“Christopher, it’s night time ok, I get you’re in a good mood but mommy doesn’t like to woken up in the middle of the night”. 

He finally let go of that smile and looked at me…scared. 

“Did I make you unhappy, momma?”, he asked. 
“No, honey-“
“He doesn’t like it when people are unhappy”, he interrupted. 
“Who?”, I asked. 
“Mr. Happy”
I had enough.
“Honey, who is Mr Happy?”
“He’s the man I talk to, he says that he’s tired of you being miserable because of the divorce with dad and your misery is only making him angry and stronger”.

“Stronger?”, I replied. 
“Yes. Mr. Happy wants the whole world to be happy.”, he said. 
I didn’t know how to respond. I noticed a bruise on Christopher’s right arm. A large dark red bruise. 
“Christopher, what happened to your arm?”
“He told me not to tell you”
I was upset at this point. 

“Christopher, you stop this stupid non sense and tell me what happened to your god damn arm? Who hurt you?” I yelled at him.

He started crying and he bursted it out. 
“It was Mr Happy, he wouldn’t let go until I changed my frown into a smile, he says he’s going to do the same to you but to your neck.”

I was fuming, I couldn’t take it, I don’t know how Christopher can come up with all this. My son is not mentally ill, I know someone hurt him and he wasn’t making this up. 

“I want to meet him, where is Mr. Happy?”

Christopher stopped his crying and pointed at his closet. 

I turned my head around, slowly got up and walked towards his closet. I saw Christopher was slowly getting a panic attack. 

“Mom, don’t open the closet, I’m scared”.
I ignored him. I opened the closet door as quickly as I could but there was nothing. Christopher let out a sigh of relief and I as well. Then I felt something funny, like I had eaten dry hard popcorn, I started to choke. 

“Mom, what’s wrong?”, Christopher yelled. 

“MOM!”

I was being choked by an entity. I locked my hands around my neck as I was slowly being levitated. Christopher couldn’t stop screaming.

“He wants you to be happy, mom! He wants you to be happy!”

I couldn’t breath, it was getting tighter, I can feel an extreme pressure as if I was about to faint, all I can hear was Christopher yelling with the words “be happy” back and forth. 

I needed to get out of this. I looked at my son who was crying his eyes out and panicking and I did what I had to do at this point, I had to be happy, so I extended a huge smile across my face as I was being severely choked to death. 
I dropped to the floor. He let go of me. I was grasping for all the air I could and my neck felt as stiff as a post. 

Christopher came running at my comfort. He hugged me and then he whispered
“Be happy momma”

I was crying my eyes out, trying to catch every breath of air I could and I looked at my son…and I smiled, as so did he.
