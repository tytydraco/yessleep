It was still raining when I woke up, many hours later.  It was one in the morning.  At least I’d had the sense to do something so dangerous in the afternoon, when I wouldn’t miss classes.  Yeah, I know.  Priorities.  Still thinking of my grades, despite everything.  That ever-present specter of failure that would haunt me for a lifetime.  I rolled off my bed, my mouth tasting like something had died in it and my stomach twisting uncomfortably from a missed meal.

There was a light on in the kitchen and I found a note on the counter.  Cassie had made a tuna casserole and left a plate for me in the fridge.  I took it back to my room to eat cold, because I didn’t want to wake her up with the microwave.  One in the morning isn’t really that late, but Cassie has an early morning class this semester and I was trying to be respectful of her.  Also I didn’t want to make her any more upset at me than she already was.

Then I went back to bed and lay there, wide-awake, staring at the wall and listening to the rain against my window.

I felt strange.  Everything was changing again and I was terrified, because what if it all changed for the worse (and so far that had been the trend in my life, I lost my father and everything after that was awful) and what if I lost the few good things in my life?  I thought of Grayson leaving and wondering if our friendship would survive that and I knew it wouldn’t, because he was inhuman and his humanity was an act, a farce, and he’d have no reason to keep in touch once he was gone.  And then what if something similar happened when Cassie and I graduated and we fell apart and I was alone again?

And what if we didn’t get Maria back.

I got up and left the apartment.  I wasn’t thinking, I just knew that I needed to be elsewhere.  I couldn’t stay cooped up in my room with these thoughts any longer.  Movement brought some kind of release so I went, out into the night, across the main street, and back onto campus.

The rain wasn’t heavy, but it was a persistent, soaking rain, and I was glad I’d at least had the sense to grab my raincoat.  I didn’t encounter anyone else on campus.  There were lights in the dormitories still on, but anyone with sense was staying inside on a rainy night like this.  I’m sure that statement alone says volumes about my own mental state.

I don’t recall making a conscious decision about where I was going, but inevitably I found myself turning towards the graveyard.  

It didn’t feel the same.  Even with the darkness, it somehow felt less intimidating than it ever did in the daylight.  Less dangerous.  The rust on the iron fencing was more noticeable and the pathways were open and inviting.  The headstones seemed sunken, hunched close to the dirt so they wouldn’t be noticed.  I walked up to the fence and stared into the graveyard, realizing that if I looked hard enough, I could see all the way to the other side of it.  It wasn’t that big of a plot of land.  With the tree gone, it was nothing more than a cemetery tucked away on campus, with an empty grave plot that should have been filled long ago and secrets that no longer had a guardian.

I placed my hands on the iron fencing, feeling the cold, slick metal beneath my fingertips.  My jeans were starting to cling to my legs from the rain that escaped my rain coat, but I didn’t care.  The cold was soothing against the burn of the millepede bites.

Another hand was placed against the iron fencing next to mine.  I didn’t even flinch.  I was too numb to be surprised anymore, and besides, I could see who had come to stand next to me in the rain.

Grayson.

“I couldn’t sleep,” I said.  “What about you?  Do you even *need* sleep?”

“I don’t,” he replied, staring off into the graveyard. “I do it anyway.”

“Do you ever dream?”

“No.”

We stood shoulder to shoulder in silence for a moment longer.

“I won’t be sleeping tonight,” he said.  “I’ve been on campus all evening and I don’t care to leave yet.  This is… the most at peace I’ve ever felt.  I can’t feel it eating at me any longer.  It’s been… a very long time since I didn’t have to fight its pull.”

There was a tone of wonderment in his voice.  Mentally, I ran through the timeline.  The first president tried to harness the inhuman by creating Grayson.  If Grayson had felt the tree’s presence for *most* of his existence and it had been created by one of the president’s accomplices, then it must have happened in the short timespan between Grayson’s creation and the death of Professor Monotone’s ancestor.

I needed to talk to the professor, I resolved.  Surely he could find something out for me.

“So what happens now?” I ventured.

“Same plan as before.  I leave.  It’ll just be a bit easier now.”

The devil had said things would change.  This didn’t feel like what he had promised.  It was too slight.  The devil was anything but *subtle*.

“Can you… give James’s body back to him?”  

I was breathless with fear.  What if he said no?  What if he refused?  What could I do then?  But he remained as impassive as always and I know now that his calm wasn’t simply because he was better grounded than me, but because he’s *not human*.

“Yes,” he said quietly.  “I can do that.  Everything… will go faster now, with the tree gone.  We don’t need to wait until graduation.  Just a few more weeks, I think.”

“Do we have that long?  I’m worried about Maria-”

“James lingered on campus for years,” he said curtly.  “Maria can hold on for a few weeks.”

But James suffered that whole time, I thought.  I couldn’t bear seeing Maria’s ghost, stabbed until it was unrecognizable, not even if it was temporary.

I didn’t say that.  Instead, I asked him where *he* would go.  What form he would take when he no longer needed James’s body.  He blinked at me and then he began to smile.  A pleased, expectant smile, like that of a child with a surprise hidden in their hands.

“We’re going to leave together, of course,” he said.  “I know this is what you want.  You don’t want to be left alone, more than anything else in this world.”

I recoiled from him.  I staggered backwards, staring at him in horror and confusion, and he just kept smiling.  Like nothing was wrong.  And perhaps nothing *was* wrong in his mind, because he was right, I *am* terrified of being alone.

“I’m - James’s - replacement?” 

It was hard to breath.  Even harder to speak.  The smile vanished off Grayson’s face, replaced by startled concern.  He started to raise a hand, to reach for me, then quickly snatched it back when I flinched.

“No, no, of course not,” he said quickly.  “I’m not going to take your body because that doesn’t work.  It’ll decay.  I can’t keep doing that.  I wouldn’t do that to *you*.”

“Then *what*!?  What are you trying to tell me?”

This time, his excitement overcame his reservations.  He closed the gap between us with one step, grabbing my hands and holding them in his own before I could react.

“Don’t you get it?”

He squeezed them painfully tight.  He was smiling with excitement.

“We’ll be together,” he continued, his eyes shining with intensity.  “We’re going to *share*.  You’ll become me and I’ll become you and we’ll both live forever.  This is - this - it’s why I tried to be your boyfriend.  I thought I’d make the transition easier.”

The absurdity of his rationale made me laugh out loud.  Perhaps that’s how the inhuman view us, seeing our relationships and entanglements only on the surface level, the minimum required understanding for them to blend in or exploit us for their own purposes.

“I don’t want that!” I gasped.  “Let go of me!  I’m *me* and I want to *stay* that way!”

“But it’s too late, isn’t it?”

He didn’t let go of my hands.  He didn’t stop smiling.  As if nothing was wrong.  As if this was all *fine*-

“-you’ve been drinking the water since last school year, though you don’t remember, and that’s laid the groundwork-”

-like it was *fine* when people asked if I was okay after dad vanished and I lied and said I was *fine*-

“-look, you’re already connected to the inhuman, here, I’ll show you what you can do now-”

-like it was *fine* when my ex-boyfriend yelled and lost his temper and then apologized and I lied and said I was *fine*-

“-see, the river will listen to you, you don’t have to fear it anymore and soon you won’t have to fear *anything*-”

-like it was *fine* when it felt like my whole life was being mapped out for me because what choice did I have but to keep going and be *fine* with it all-

“STOP IT!”

I screamed at him.  I wrenched my hands free of his.  The water around us was up to my mid-shins, cold, the current tugging at my ankles.

“YOU DON’T GET TO TELL ME WHAT I WANT!”

I was clutching my stomach with both arms.  The words ripped out of my throat like I’d been wanting to scream them at someone for a long time now.

The therapist I saw would be so proud.

“Grayson,” I said, a little more calm, despite my pounding heart, “I’m sorry you’re trapped here.  I’m sorry that you were used as a tool in some egomaniac’s bid for immortality.  And maybe you think this is what’s best for us-”

I swallowed hard.  He said we’d live forever.  Maybe this is what he was brought here for, so many years ago.  Maybe he’s still playing the role prescribed to him.

“-but this isn’t what I want.  We have to find a different solution.”

The traveling river was to my knees now.  Something brushed against my legs.  I kept my eyes fixed on Grayson, refusing to look away.  He’d said something about… being connected to the inhuman?  That the river would listen to me?

Something like anger crossed Grayson’s face.  It was an ugly, startling expression.  His eyes narrowed and he stepped forwards and I felt a flutter of fear in my stomach.

“Let me show you, then,” he said grimly.  “Come on.  I’ll take you there, so you know what you’re *choosing* to consign me to.”

The ground was gone from underneath my feet.  I sank into the water and flailed desperately, trying to turn myself around, trying to reach the shore and pull myself out.  I felt a hand close on my shoulder and firmly, insistently, push me down.  Underneath the surface of the river.

“I don’t have a replacement lined up,” he continued.  “I should have and oh - that made the flickering man so *angry* with me - but this one could be the last body I take, I don’t have to steal any more-”

The water closed in over my head.  And as terror sent ice coursing through my veins and my mind started to retreat into that dark quiet where it didn’t have to process what was happening around me - I thought - I already knew what Grayson feared, because I *felt* it already, I felt his fear, it was that crushing darkness and the vast openness like an ocean.  And I felt - of all things - I felt *annoyed*.  I was perfectly capable of understanding and making my own choices without Grayson drowning me in the process.

So I turned that annoyance outwards, towards its rightful target.

Yep.

I twisted around in the water and punched Grayson in the face.

Okay, so it wasn’t a very strong punch.  I was underwater.  It’s kind of hard to build momentum in that environment.  It startled Grayson though, and it busted his lip or bloodied his nose, I wasn’t able to tell which.  But he recoiled, suspended in the water, his eyes wide with surprise and his face trailing a thin streamer of blood.

I didn’t stick around for him to try again.  I kicked hard, pulling myself through the water towards what I hoped was the shore.  Out.  I needed out of here.  That was the only thought I had in my mind, my body finally spurred into motion and driven by panic.

And the creatures in the river, they surged around me like a school of fish, because I didn’t have to fear them anymore as Grayson had promised.

I hit the bank.  It was sheer, like the side of a cliff, and I clung to the soil.  The creatures in the river crowded around my legs and then - there was one beneath my feet, huge and solid and I found purchase on its back - a surge of sharp terror at its touch - and then it shoved me up and out of the river.

So the river is on my side now.  I was changed, against my will, but damn I’ll take the advantage if it’s been handed to me.  I certainly need any edge I can get right now.

I stumbled away from the river and turned around to see Grayson pulling himself out on the opposite bank, the one that had been closest to him.  His bangs clung to his forehead and he looked miserable from what little I could see through the water on my glasses.  Small and sad and so very wet.  Like a kitten getting a bath.

He said something to me but I couldn’t make it out over the current of the river and the slap of the raindrops all around me.  I didn’t stick around to let him try again.  He didn’t try to follow me, at least, even though my spine prickled as I hurried off campus, like he was still there watching me.

It was like something had been carved out of my chest and it hurt because I trusted him, I *still* want to trust him, but I think of his hands holding mine and the excitement on his face and it makes my skin crawl.

Is *all* of this because of him?  The water?  The memory loss?

I want to throw up just thinking about it.

There was a light on in the kitchen when I returned to the apartment.  Nervously, I entered, and my heart sunk as I found Cassie sitting in the kitchen, her arms crossed, looking more pissed off than I have ever seen her look before.  My cellphone sat on the table in front of her.  I’d forgotten it in my bedroom when I left the apartment.

“Did you forget we put up a security system to keep you from sneaking out?” she said quietly.

“I… totally did,” I replied.

She sighed and went into the bathroom to get a towel, which she threw at my face with way more violence than was necessary.  I suppose I deserved it.  I dried off and changed into clean clothing, then reluctantly returned to the kitchen because I knew Cassie would still be waiting for me.  It was four in the morning.  I suspected neither of us were going to get any more sleep tonight.

She’d made hot chocolate.  Bless her.

“Start at the beginning,” she said when I sat down.  “The stake the devil left us is gone.  And you went missing for a while, then showed up after I’d gone to bed, then left again.  What happened?”

I told her.  How the devil promised me… some kind of change… and I couldn’t handle choosing between Grayson and Maria and I took his offer and killed the petrified tree.

The tree that was an alder tree and could resist the rain.

“Why didn’t you tell me?” she asked.  “You could have called me and we could have talked it through.  Maybe you would have still wound up at the tree, but at least you wouldn’t have done it alone.  You don’t have to do all of this by yourself, you know?”

Guilt stabbed through me.

“I’m sorry,” I said, staring down at the floor.  “I was so upset I just - I wasn’t thinking.  I just thought - I wanted -”

I took a deep breath.  And then I said it.  I said that for so long I’ve felt guilty for *existing*, because dad left home to work to provide for *us*, and that was what killed him.  This was my penance.  If I saved everyone else, if I became what everyone else wanted me to be, maybe I could make up for daring to exist and getting my dad killed.

“Wow,” Cassie said when I was done.  “I think you need to start seeing that therapist again.”

She rubbed at her temples and sighed in resignation.

“Well,” she said quietly.  “What’s done is done so I guess we’ll just… deal with the consequences.  But please don’t do something this insane again without me.  I can’t handle losing you.  You’re my friend and I care about you.  I don’t care because you’ve been trying to shield me from the monsters, I don’t care because I need someone to share the rent with.  I care about *you*.  Just *you.*  And there’s plenty others that feel the same way.  More than you realize, I think.”

I was quiet for a moment because how do you respond to that?  All I could think of was to say ‘thanks’ awkwardly and then tell her that it gets worse.  Much worse. 

And I told her about Grayson.

There was profanity.  Lots of profanity in combinations I’d never heard before.  It was fascinating.  Then, once Cassie calmed down enough to have a rational conversation (which was an effort on her part), she asked the question that I’d been wondering on the whole walk back to the apartment.

“Do you think he’s being malicious,” she said, “or misguided?”

“Does it matter?  End result is the same.  I’m going to feel awful about it either way.”

She was quiet a moment and I could tell that she disagreed, but had decided not to argue the point.  She fiddled with her mug for a moment and I stared her while she did that for a moment and then stupidly asked her if she’d gotten a new color of fingernail polish, because I couldn’t think of anything else to say.  She laughed at that, a weak, relieved laugh, and yes, it was new.

“We’re not going to accomplish anything tonight,” she finally said.  “Let’s figure this out in the morning when we’re not both exhausted and cranky and our brains are actually working.  Maybe Josh can help.”

Then she glanced past me, towards the windows where we could hear the rain gently tapping on the panes.

“Does it worry you at all that it’s been raining non-stop since the tree died?” Cassie asked.

Yes.  It worried me very much.
