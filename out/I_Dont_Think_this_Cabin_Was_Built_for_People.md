I thought the mountain was hollow.

Not in the geological sense—no sinkholes, no caverns plotted on topo maps. I mean it felt wrong underfoot, like walking on the skin of something holding its breath.

I told myself that three times on the drive up. A joke that didn’t land. I’d rented a cabin that promised total seclusion, no neighbors for miles. The kind of place where quiet is the main feature.

The photos showed wood siding the color of toast, a chimney thick enough for a century of winters, a deck buried in snow. The owner’s directions were simple: follow a county road, pass a closed campground, take a service track behind a rusted cattle gate. “Key is in the lockbox,” their message said. “Wood in the shed. If you need me, ranger office downtown usually knows how to reach me.”

No one knew I was going.

I wanted silence. Phones off, inbox forgotten. No city noise pretending to be life. Just nothing.

The last bar of reception vanished around noon. The pines leaned closer the higher I climbed. Past the campground, past picnic tables that looked fossilized, the world thinned until even the wind seemed hesitant. By the time I rolled through the cattle gate, the quiet pressed so hard my ears popped.

The trees bled black resin. Not amber beads—tar-dark veins that slicked down bark into the snow. Where it touched, the snow dented, like something had pushed up from beneath to meet it halfway.

The cabin sat in an oval clearing, more absence than space. The deck leaned, the chimney sagged, the door was too new. When I stepped inside, dust rose like breath on a mirror.

It was fine. Cold, but fine. Wood stove in the corner, a bedframe that looked built by a twelve-year-old, shrink-wrap film on the windows bubbling at the seams. The thermometer on the wall read thirty-eight degrees. I fed the stove from the stacked firewood. The first log caught, filling the air with the smell every “cabin candle” is trying to earn.

The quiet didn’t soften. If anything it pressed harder, like a rule posted without words.

I tried to sleep on the couch that first night, fire burning high. Around midnight the stove hiccuped—smoke pressed down into the room before the draft corrected. I thought that was the worst of it until I heard the scrape.

Not skittering. Not mice. A slow drag beneath the floorboards, stone on stone. The wood shifted a fraction, like something was testing the weight above.

I pressed my hand to the floor. Felt it. Steady. Deliberate. Then gone.

I didn’t sleep.

By morning I told myself it was frost heave, or ice shifting in the soil. Something natural, something boring. But that night the scraping came again, multiplied, drifting beneath the stove, under the bathroom, under my bed. The boards rose and fell in rhythm. Not human, not animal. Too even. Like the floor itself was inhaling.

I whispered “No,” just to hear something human.

I didn’t leave. Not yet.

The next morning, I stepped onto the deck with coffee. That’s when the treeline moved.

Something slid between the pines, taller than the trees themselves. For a moment it looked like a pillar of bark. Then it leaned, and cracks split open to reveal pale matter shifting beneath armor-like plates. Its head sagged forward, eyeless, mouthless—until cartilage ground open in a ring, wet and deliberate.

The sound wasn’t animal. It was structural. Like a building deciding to fail.

I bolted back inside and shut the curtains, as if that would matter.

The truck wouldn’t start. The dash lit up fine, the starter groaned, but the engine stayed silent. When I looked back toward the treeline, there were more of them. A row. Not walking—growing. Plates locking into place as they rose taller, mouths opening soundlessly until the air vibrated hard enough to rattle my teeth.

By morning, they were gone.

But the floor wasn’t.

When I woke the next day, the boards around my bed were damp. Black veins ran across the floor, pulsing faintly, leading back to the stove. The iron sagged a quarter inch toward the ground, as if something below was pulling it down.

I called the ranger station. Left a voicemail that sounded sane—words like “possible frost heave” and “safety issue.” No one called me back.

By afternoon the silence had a pulse. Snow fell straight down, no wind, piling uniformly on the deck as if placed there. That night the stove failed again, coughing smoke into the room. I opened the door for air—then froze.

One of them stood at the clearing’s edge. Closer than any had dared. Plates shifting, height adjusting. Watching without eyes.

I slammed the door. Deadbolted it. Dragged the dresser against the bedroom door even though I didn’t plan on using it. Sat in the dark with the axe across my lap and the pry bar from the shed in my hand.

At midnight the floor inhaled. Every board lifted under me. The stove pipe bent as if tugged. The temperature dropped six degrees in a minute.

I yanked up a floorboard. Beneath it wasn’t dirt but fine black grounds threaded with pulsing veins. When I cut one with the axe, it stitched itself back together instantly. The ground beneath the foundation pulsed, pushing into the cabin’s frame like a lung exhaling against my ribs.

I did the only thing I could think of: fire.

I tore shrink-wrap off the windows, built a second blaze in the old hearth scar under the rug, fed it books, papers, anything that would burn. Flames licked high, but the smoke flattened under the ceiling like a lid was pressed down.

From beneath, a sound tried to form into a word. Not speech—just the shape of it. Thirty mouths guessing at vowels at once.

That was enough.

I grabbed my pack, scarf, axe, headlamp. Crawled under the floor again, jammed the pry bar across the seam near the stove. The foundation clenched, the metal bent, and I dumped the stove’s ash bucket into the crack. Embers glowed and died like something below had breathed them out.

I didn’t wait for proof. I ran.

The clearing was smaller. Trees leaned inward. The ground caught at my boots, granular like walking on beans. The tall shape waited at the edge, height adjusting, pale matter flexing inside plates.

I aimed for the only gap that looked like a corridor and sprinted.

Behind me, the cabin exhaled. The sound stripped the heat off my back.

I don’t remember crossing the gate. Just the pin between my teeth, the chain giving, and the road widening until the world finally sounded alive again. Birds. Water. A snowplow dragging its blade.

At the first gas station I left another voicemail: “The ground at that cabin isn’t right. The floor breathes. Something in the trees. Please—” I stopped before I said eats people. Said hurts people instead.

No one called back.

That was weeks ago.

I thought I was safe. But last night, in my apartment three floors up, the quiet shifted. My ears popped. I pressed my hand to the floor and told myself I was cured by data.

Then I heard it.

A faint drag, rearranging something granular. Not loud. Not close. Just the sound of a thousand hands under a floor, moving, remembering.

And I don’t think it wants me back on the mountain.

I think the mountain is coming here.
