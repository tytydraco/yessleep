The basement had been sealed shut for decades. A thick wooden door bolted and nailed, left untouched since I was a child. My parents wouldn't talk about it. When I asked, my father’s face would go pale, and my mother’s hands would tremble. I remember it all happening around the time my sister, Olivia, went missing. She was in the house, playing with me, laughing, then she said she was going to grab a soda. Next thing we knew, she was gone. No forced entry. No signs of a struggle. The police searched for nearly a year. They even tried to arrest my parents, but their lawyer was ruthless, and there was no evidence. 

My parents never mentioned Olivia again. But I remembered. I remembered the crying at night, the bitter arguments behind closed doors, the way they'd scream any time I wandered too close to the basement. And I remembered watching my father, pale and sweating, as he hammered the last nails into the basement door. As a kid, I was confused more than anything. One day, I had a sister, my best friend, my partner in every game and then she was just… gone. At first, I thought it was a mistake, that she’d come back any minute, soda in hand, laughing like nothing happened. But days turned into weeks, and the house changed. My parents changed. The warmth drained from everything. They stopped looking at me the same way, like I was fragile. I started to blame myself. Maybe I should’ve followed her. Maybe I should’ve stopped her. That guilt grew with me, twisting around my brain. And the basement door became this strange, quiet threat at the heart of our home—always there, always sealed, always watching.

I moved back into the house after my parents passed. A beautiful place to live, if you ignore the history. It has an eerie, timeless quality to it as if it had been frozen in place, waiting for my return. It sat nestled at the edge of a wooded neighborhood, the trees grow thick and wild, casting shadows over the front lawn even in the middle of the day. Just far enough from the nearest neighbors that if you screamed, no one would hear. The door was still shut when I got there, but I decided to leave it alone and focus more on unpacking. Boxes piled up in the kitchen blocking the door, which only  added to my disinterest in opening it. The years of seeing worried glances on my mom and dad's face every time I walked past it ingrained a sort of "Leave it be" mentality. 

But last week I had a dream so vivid it reignited my childhood curiosity. In the dream, I was six again, sitting on the living room floor with Liv, the sun casting warm streaks of light through the window. She was laughing, her hands sticky from a popsicle, then she stood up and said she was going to the basement to grab a soda. I told her the basement was sealed, but she just smiled, that same lopsided grin she always had, and walked toward the door like it had never been closed. As she opened it, the air grew thick and cold, and the light in the room dimmed to a dull gray. From the darkness below, something reached up with long pale fingers and wrapped around her ankle. She didn’t scream. She didn’t struggle. She just looked back at me with wide, empty eyes and whispered, “It’s still down there.” I woke up drenched in sweat, my heart pounding.

I didn’t know what it meant, but the dream gnawed at me, burrowing into my thoughts. I couldn’t shake it. It was like the door had become magnetic, and my body was being pulled to it, every instinct screaming to open it, to know.

So, I opened it. It took a bit of brute force to get all the nails out and find the key to the deadbolt. I pushed it open, the old door creaking loudly in response. I don’t know what I was expecting to be down there, maybe just an empty moldy basement filled with old furniture and cobwebs, or maybe some forgotten boxes and broken toys from our childhood. I tried to convince myself it’d be good closure, that I was doing this for Liv. But deep down, under all the rationalizations, there was a feeling I couldn’t ignore. Whatever had been sealed away all these years was waiting for me. And the moment the door cracked open, the air shifted. Like I had broken a silence that was never meant to end.

The stairs groaned beneath my weight as I walked down, each step swallowed by a growing darkness that my flashlight barely pushed back. The air stank of rust and mildew. Broken furniture lay scattered like bones, some pieces shattered, others clawed beyond recognition. Rusted tools hung crookedly on the walls, some bent, others… twisted?

I scanned the room in hopes of finding something ordinary. Instead, in the far corner, the beam of my light caught movement. A flash of something. It slipped just out of sight behind a support beam, fast, low to the ground. My breath hitched. I didn’t see a face, only something white, almost translucent, skin stretched too tightly. My flashlight flickered violently, and in that split-second of darkness, I felt it move closer.

When the light came back, the corner was empty. But something had been there. Something that knew I was watching. Fear took over my body and I ran up the stairs, slammed the door shut, and relocked the deadbolt. 

Except, I still felt watched. The feeling clung to me like a second skin, heavy, suffocating. Every room I walked into felt colder than it should. Shadows lingered too long in the corners. I started catching glimpses of movement in the reflections of windows and mirrors, quick flashes, like something ducking just out of sight. At night, I’d hear faint creaks in the floorboards downstairs, slow and deliberate, like something pacing beneath me. The worst part? It wasn't the footsteps. It was the silence between them. A charged, unnatural quiet, like the house itself was holding its breath. No matter where I was, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was following me. 

Things continued like that until last night, I woke up at 3:00 a.m. to the sound of my bedroom door slowly creaking open. I hadn't even heard the footsteps this time. Just that low, painful groan of wood on wood. I sat up, heart pounding, straining to see through the darkness. The hallway beyond the door was pitch black, but I could hear it, something was standing just beyond the threshold. 

Watching. 

Breathing. 

My bedside lamp wouldn’t turn on. The switch clicked uselessly beneath my fingers, the bulb dead and silent. I fumbled for my phone, hands shaking, but the screen stayed black, completely lifeless like the battery had been drained dry despite being on the charger. That’s when I heard it. A soft scraping—nails, long and sharp, dragging across the hallway wall just outside my door. The sound was wet somehow, like flesh sliding across plaster. Then it stepped into the room.

It was tall. It's limbs stretched far beyond what should’ve been human, bending at crooked angles, as if the bones had been broken and reset wrong over and over. It's skin was a weird pale color, stretched as if it had been shrink-wrapped to the bone. In the dim moonlight slipping through the window, I saw the outline of its face, or what should’ve been a face. There were no eyes. Just deep, sunken hollows and a wide, lipless grin carved too high into its cheeks, as though someone had drawn a smile with a knife and pulled it tight with wire. And even though the shadows cloaked most of it, I swear it was smiling right at me.

It came at me fast. The thing’s limbs twisted as it moved in a spiderlike way, jerking into the shadows with unnatural grace. The moment I tried to get up, it was across the room, crashing into me with a cold crushing weight. It's fingers wrapped around my throat, thin and cold like knives, digging in and cutting. I choked, kicked, struggled. My hand flailed and knocked over the nightstand, the crash of my lamp startling it just long enough for me to slip free and run.

I sprinted from the room and I didn’t look back. I didn’t need to. I heard it behind me, scrambling, crawling, claws on wood and ceiling. I crashed down the stairs, nearly twisting my ankle. Picking myself back up, I bolted straight for the front door and ran barefoot into the night, bleeding and gasping. The cold air sending a sharp and tingling pain to the cuts on my neck

I couldn’t help but wonder if this was what my sister went through. If she’d stood frozen, heart pounding in her chest, staring into the eyes, or the void where eyes should be, of this thing. Had it crept up on her the same way? Silent, patient, savoring the fear before the violence? The thoughts twisted in my gut, making me feel sick. Did it drag her down into that basement? Did she scream?

And then the darker questions crept in. Had she been alone in her final moments, or had this thing toyed with her like it was doing with me now? Did it take its time? Or worse, did it keep her? Feed on her terror until there was nothing left of her but memories and silence?

But the one question that kept clawing at me was… why didn’t it come for the rest of us? If it was capable of this, of death and power. Why didn’t it finish the job? Why leave my parents and I behind? Why wait all these years, only to crawl out now, just when I opened that door? The possibilities turned my blood cold.

I didn't stop running until I reached the road, a car almost hitting me. The driver slammed on the brakes, jumped out, and called the police. But when they got there, the house was fine. No damage. No scratches. No signs of forced entry. Nothing.

But I know what I saw. I can’t go back. I won’t. Whatever I let out last night wasn’t meant to be found. And now that it’s loose, I don’t think it’s finished with me.

I'm writing this in the hospital right now and I can still feel it just watching... waiting.
