Hello, I don’t know what to do anymore, I have nothing left. I feel like I have to post my story somewhere, Caleb told me that this was a good a place as any. I’m not much of a writer but I’ll try my best to retell the events of what my happened about a month ago. I just don’t want anyone to go through the same as I did if there is any way to avoid it.

It had been only two weeks since I decided that I should move away from my family and try to live alone. With help from a friend in the area. Caleb, I had always described him as being plagued with an overactive imagination, he believed that there were strange powers in the world and as well as some other psychological things I never listened. 


“Ezra it’s boiling, is the air-con not on” Caleb had shouted from the bedroom,

I replied with a sigh “no, it doesn’t work, but at least we know why this place was so cheap, the only thing that works are the fucking windows”. 

It was mid summer, the sun unrelenting, the apartment was acting like an oven, 

“we should probably get something to eat, there’s a nice italian place down the road, it’s got outdoor seating it should be nice and cool there, we can continue this later” Caleb said as he came into the room sweat dripping down his face.

“Alright, meet you downstairs I'll lock up”,

 “make sure to close the window you don't want anyone climbing in while were gone” Caleb noted pointing past me to the window.

The glass was thin, probably only single paned. It was currently slid open halfway letting in a breeze of cool air, it was covered by a set of blinds surprisingly unstained, it looked out into a fire escape balcony similar to those found in nearly any city apartment block. 

“Sure” I replied as I turned to place anything of value where intruders probably wouldn't look, 

“It'll be fine” I thought as I readied to leave. I felt a chill up my back, as though a cool breeze was hitting the back of my neck, it felt cold,

“fucking hell how wide did I leave it open” I exclaimed I should probably close the window, it’s hot today but I don't want it to be freezing when we get back, id also have to deal with Caleb berating me for leaving it open. I turned to close it, and left Caleb.

I left down the stairs, six flights down to reach the ground floor where I met with Caleb. We walked to the ‘Bianca Inseguire’ , a small Italian pizza place with a covered outside eating area. It was empty at this time of day, about 4:30pm. We ordered a large pie to share. We sat at the edge of the seating area, my back facing the street towards my apartment as I looked toward the shop, with Caleb directly opposite me. 

“You sure that you’ll be good on your own tonight, there can be a lot of people that see a new face and see something to use” Caleb said anticipating a response.

I gave it some thought, “no you’re good thanks but I'm sure that Jess will be waiting for you”, 

“ok just check in later tonight I wouldn't want the guilt of hearing that you got torn apart in your sleep because you forgot to close your window” Caleb says out of nowhere,

 “What the fuck? Thank you Caleb, that really puts me at ease. I'll be fine”.

… I felt a breeze, a similar chill as earlier, an ice cold shiver crawled up my back, as though death was ushering me to the beyond, placing their arm over my shoulder and telling me that it would be okay. 

“Ahh, ok, are these cold winds a normal thing here”, i said to Caleb, his head was cocked curiously, 

“There is no wind, what did you feel?”,

 “nothing just felt a cold breeze hit the back of my neck, nothing special”, Caleb looked mildly disturbed, as he looked around the feeling faded.

 “What are you doing?” I had asked,

 “just looking around, there might be someone watching you”. I ignored this comment and shook my head, changing the subject. We spoke for a while and then parted for the night.


On my way back to my apartment I met my upstairs neighbour. He was alright. I told him that I had just moved in, and we chatted for a while, however he did seem slightly disappointed to find out that I was single, which was weird but I passed it off. He was about mid 60s short black hair, his name was Moses. After talking a while I left for my home. 

All was good, I spent a couple of hours setting up what I had, it wasn't much but I was meticulous.  The window was closed, the blinds opened slightly, it was dark. I sat away from the window book in hand. I felt a sharp cold chill shiver up my spine, shooting through my nerves at the base of my neck. I knew the window was closed, I knew this was not a breeze, I may be sceptical but I'm not stupid, fool me once shame on you, shame me twice and whatever the fuck they say. 

I understood what he meant, I felt something watching, I felt it, unnerving, I sat frozen, fear, uncertainty. I sat there still for what couldn't have been more than 30 minutes, the feeling stayed, it wouldn't go, I stood slowly and walked into the bedroom, closed the door and wedged a chair up against it. I felt the chill fade as I sat in relief, there were no windows in the bedroom, nothing to be eyed through. I rang Caleb, at this point it was about 9:00pm. 

As it rang I was breathing heavily trying my very best to compose myself. He answered 

“Hey it’s me we need to talk, when can you come here” I whispered, still breathing heavily, 

“Ok calm down, have you been running?", Caleb replied in a worrying tone

 “ye.. no No it doesn't matter I'll tell you if you get here”

Caleb answered “Sure, be there in 10”, I put the phone down. 

I sat in silence. I could hear what might have been the sound of banging, on glass as though something was palming the window, looking for something, looking for me. I don't know, my mind might have been filling the silence, trying to create some sort of narrative. I hoped that I was losing it. I hoped that I was just anxious, paranoid. I was in a new place, of course I was going to feel strange. I was manic.

It felt as though I was waiting for hours. I began to hear my door unlock, I breathed out a sigh of relief and moved the chair blocking the door as I saw Caleb walk through the door carrying a confused look. As he walked in I caught something. I heard something. 

It was quick, the sound of something moving up the fire escape outside the window, the sound of metal creaking as it was traversed. I didn’t think about it at the time but these fire escapes are built to hold the weight of multiple people rushing down in the case of an emergency. It would have taken a lot of weight to make the sounds that we heard, at the time though, this didn’t register. The rest of the night went by without much issue.


It was the next morning, Caleb stayed the night, nothing came to the window, from then Caleb would stay with me until whatever it was stopped perving on me. The morning after I had decided to investigate the fire escape….

“Fuck!, oh shit” I had slipped right onto my ass the instant I stepped foot onto the balcony.

As I began to stand I felt my hands run frictionlessly on the ground. Looking down I saw a clear thick gel, or paste, it was some kind of oily lubricant, it had a strong scent of ammonia and sweat. I got my balance and noticed that it not only sat on the metal floor but also up the side of the railings. I looked up and it covered the handrails of each, ascending, almost as though it was used like a ladder. 

The idea alone made my heart drop. Before I climbed to see where it led I saw the oil on the window stuck to it as though someone had been wiping it down, back and forth. I gritted my teeth and climbed to the roof following the trail. As I got to the roof it was hard not to notice what looked to be a layer of this oil lying in the corner.

Just so you all understand, this roof had a raised ledge, the type where someone could have a picnic next to the edge without anyone on an opposing roof or from below noticing. 

Looking over the edge, it had a view of the street, and Bianca Inseguire, the restaurant that me and Caleb had attended the day before. 

“Shit”...

..

…I felt a chill, a cold shock, it climbed up my back, the hairs of my neck on end. I pretended not to notice, I started gazing over the edge down to the street. I caught what may have been something in my periphery. I tried my best to discern what it was, it stuck out above the ledge of a building over. 

It, it might have been a head, but it was pale, too pale to be a person, well, a living one anyway but it was too difficult to tell. I whispered a silent prayer, the wintry grasp of uncertainty faded, as I faced towards where I thought the figure may be. 

The shape was no longer there, I had thought it to be some sort of mirage or a trick of the light. I briskly walked to the stairs being careful not to slip on what I hoped was oil.

I had spoke to Caleb about what happened. For about two weeks Caleb stayed with me, for about every day of those two weeks I would feel eyes upon me, watching me whenever I was alone. But one day it went away, no feelings of being watched, nothing. We figured that whatever was watching me had given up, if anything was watching me at all. So Caleb left to spend some time with his family. I was alone. How wrong I would be.

…


I was relieved that it was over. It was my first time alone for two weeks.

I decided to watch Lord of the Rings, all of them, in order. Caleb for all of his flaws was a great guy, but his worst flaw had to have been his unnatural disdain for the franchise. 

Like all the days prior it was hot, even in the darkness of the late day my apartment held tight onto the essence of the midday sun. 

I opened the window, just enough to allow the room to cool. I stayed up late, anxious that my stalker was still here, but everything needed sleep. If it was still planning on watching me then it would probably do so tomorrow. It was about 2:00 pm when my weary mind pulled me to bed.

I lay and struggled in the sheets for a minute or so getting comfy. My back to the door. Sleep began to fall over me.

…I was still. Tachycardic, I was cold. A freezing chill against my nape, it spread like a miasma around my form. I felt fragile, vulnerable. I left the window open. My room was bare, nothing but a small mirror on my nightstand.

I saw it.

It was long, blurry, tears forming in my vision, long thin appendages stretched over me, one grasping my bed frame, the other the floor at the bottom of my bed. Its head not but a foot from my form, small in comparison, large fish-like eyes sat in sunken sockets, each the size of a clenched fist. They were inky, ghoulish, void of light.

I didn't feel anything. My body was numb; there was not a sound from the creature, not a breath not a blink. I was scared, was this my perdition. I wanted it to be over. I looked at its reflection within the mirror, into its eyes. Its face shot towards the mirror, staring at me, face to face. I let out a cry, as I rushed to the corner of my room. I didn't care what happened, I just wanted it to stop. 

I Couldn't feel my feet on the ground, I was falling, not even the adrenaline rushing through me could suppress the pain of my femur being torn from its socket, popping, the muscle twisting free, tearing. My blood draining from my body. 

I spun through the air, like a ragdoll I hit the floor with a thud, on my back the creature moving towards me, quadrupedal, limbs bent as it crawled towards me holding my limp limb in its long, bony fingers. I was screaming, crying someone had to hear.

“GOD HELP ME!” I cried out

It got closer, here I could see it pale and thin its body secreting a thick liquid a strong smell of ammonia filled the room as the creature began to experience what I could only describe as pure ecstasy, it reached its finger to my face and into my mouth, I gagged as it extended reaching into my throat. I felt the cold oily, sweat filling my body. This made breathing a challenge. 

It sat, waiting. The blood pouring from my stump pittered to a halt. My muscles tightened. Any attempt to move was useless. I lay paralysed. At its mercy. It shook with anticipation, glee, pride. 

It opened what had to be its mouth, almost unnoticeable up until now, a chasm of shard like teeth hovered over the leg in its hand. It began to feast, like a glutton; it stripped away the meat, its teeth forking the tough flesh down the bone, as though it was eating a pork rib. Once it was done with my leg it placed its hand upon my face for leverage, as it slowly twisted off my left arm. 

I couldn't move, I couldn't scream, the pain was unbearable. I felt every muscle fibre tear, every blood vessel burst, every nerve scream in pain, skin pulling apart like a plastic bag. My arm pulled free with a loud snap. It didn't bleed. It was taking its time. It gorged itself on my body for what had to be three hours. I counted every second, distracting myself from my infernal torture, the longer I spent looking at it the more human it felt. 

It embodied the sins of man, the pride of a hunter that finally caught its prey, the gluttony of a king who feasted whilst his people starved, the greed of a someone who had it all, craving more, the lust of a man starved of attention watching people through his window, the sloth of a recluse laying in for days on end watching people through a screen, and the wrath of someone who had lost it all tearing apart the lives of others, for their own gain, but it wasn't envious it had the power to tear a man apart. But what do I know? I was dying, delirious.

I tried to die, forcing my body to give up, to allow the darkness to encroach my vision. I was broken. I was failing.

I was dying.

My senses were fading. This is when I heard it. A crack, followed by a long bang, ending with an ear piercing screech, the sound of a city of screaming souls shot through me.

All I remember was the sound of Moses, speaking, shouting, calling for help. I shot in and out of consciousness,

 I saw bright halls, people. I lived.

…

I survived. I awoke in a hospital, a feeding tube down my throat, Caleb was asleep in a chair beside me. A basket on a side table. I tried to speak but my body betrayed me, I reached for the tube, but nothing gasped at it. I looked down at my body, at least what remained. 

I was left with an arm, my left. I was right handed. My body was bandaged. I forced my last limb up to the tube. Weakly climbing through the air and gently clamping around it. In my struggle Caleb awoke.

I could hear what sounded like him calling for help. I must have been on a lot of painkillers, I can't say I was thankful, was this really better than death. I was in the hospital for weeks as I recovered. I couldn't speak a word, my vocal cords haemorrhaged to the point of vanity, they were useless. 

At this time I learned that in the night Moses heard my screaming and something about a hole in the floor, and came down to me with a shotgun in hand, he sent it running for the window where it fled into the night. We both knew that it was an unbelievable story, we kept quiet about it.

I had to share this story, I ignored my instinct, that feeling of being watched, if I had not appeased it by allowing it to watch me for so long I feel that it would have left me alone and found someone else, at least that’s what I’d like to think. It’s still out there, hunting, stalking. Its image is still stuck in my mind, it lurks behind my closed eyes, I hardly sleep anymore

I don't know anymore. Caleb blames himself for what happened, he shouldn't. He took me in, I live with him and his family, a burden. I have lost all drive to continue to live in paranoia, I just hope to feel the pull of death, a mercy.

I have no information on what this is, what legends or religions may speak of it I don’t know, I haven’t been searching. So if any questions arise I don’t know if I could answer them, but I’ll try.

I hope that anyone who reads this will take caution, trust in your instincts. I feel that the least I could do was to share my experience. Be careful.


Yours sincerely, Ezra
