Yesterday I…well we boarded a plane. I don’t know wether I’m still on it. It was mine and my husbands anniversary. 10 years in and I’ll be honest rocky. He’d take me somewhere every year but this year was different, an attempt to patch things up. A desperate plea for forgiveness. We were going to L.A from Heathrow. Getting to the plane was business as usual, we had a 6am flight to save money but everything was easy. A few odd characters here and there but that’s to be expected at an airport. We boarded the plane late, unexpected weather conditions meant that air traffic control had to change our route. Which you’ve ever flown a plane, you’d understand that as a very regular occurrence. 

We got on the plane at 7:30am, the plane then took off at 9am. Between these delays were the same litany of excuses they always love to give you. Takeoff was rough for me especially, I’m deathly scared of heights and planes were about as high as you can realistically get. I’m not scared of heights in the way people assume I am. People assume I’m afraid of falling, afraid of hitting the ground. The real thing to be afraid of is the sky itself, I fear it the same way in which I fear the ocean. In both the sea and sky, everywhere is open, there is an endless unmapped void waiting to show you what lies inside it. That’s the fear. The unknowing, the monotony of the same sky, no way to know how one patch of sky is different from another. It terrifies me. 

I spent takeoff clinging to my husband, looking away from the window adjacent to my seat, a poor placement in hindsight. The higher and higher we got the deeper the pit in my stomach grew. However this time it didn’t feel rooted in irrationality. Normally I can mentally gymnastic my way out of fear, but my heart and mind were in unison. When I glanced out the window my mind saw something my eyes didn’t and it hated it. By the time we were steadily going in the air and the seatbelt lights were off, my mind had somewhat done its job. The plane was no longer scary, now the plane was a safety vessel, it kept what was out there away, it kept me inside. 

Soon after I shut the window, didn’t want my brain to continue perceiving what was clearly bothersome. Then the flight continued as normal, became another average experience. No complaints other than the man behind me, whose feet were on my arm rest. For the whole flight I just put my headphones on and detached myself focusing solely internally, it was a good distraction. In retrospect this span of time is hazy. Much more important things took up the space. I started getting antsy at some point, just ready to land and be done with it. I looked at my phone and it had been 11 hours. The flight itself was 11 hours so naturally I expected us to be landing soon. An hour later we hadn’t, still not a huge concern, I could have missed an announcement on some kind of diversion. So I turned to my husband and asked him how long until he thinks we’ll land. He laughed at me and said word for word “We’ve only just taken off”. 

I double, tripled checked my phone and it still said the same thing, 9:30pm. I turned my phone to face him, asked him what it said, he said 9:15am. My first thought was that he was fucking with me but on a trip to mend a marriage, fucking with your wife is beyond foolish even for someone like him. My second thought was that my mind was playing tricks in me, I don’t have a history of mental illness so I didn’t love that thought either both because it felt unrealistic and because it meant I was somewhat crazy. So I just went to sleep, it was late, I was tired and by the time I wake up I was certain that it would all go away. 

I woke up well rested, sleep dust in the corners of my eye. I turn to my husband who looks at me curiously. I ask him what time it is. He says “It’s only been a couple minutes since you last asked”. I became very awake as I reached into the net in front of me and checked my phone. It was the next day, 8am. I’m rather proud that I didn’t freak out, as whilst I have irrational fears, I am generally rational. So I gathered myself and took things step by step. I looked around at the people, everyone still seemingly in the honeymoon phase of the flight. Happily talking to their family and friends, not yet tired and frustrated by their company. Next was checking my husbands phone, I took it from the net in front of him and it said the same. Both phones said 8am. 

Even though I would love to trust the words of my husband, a second source was a sensible option. So as I got up on the pretence of going to the bathroom I asked the woman on the other side of my husband. She agreed with my husband, we had only just taken off. I nodded doing my best to act like everything was still normal. I then began wandering the aisles and looking for anything out of place, I still averted my gaze from the windows, that fear was yet to go away. Nothing was out of place, the plane was operating and looking like any other plane I had ever been on. After a while I actually went to the bathroom, thinking a moment alone might help. When I got in there I examined myself, staring at my reflection, searching for oddities. 

My eyes had to be wrong as nothing else made sense, even the sky has to follow certain rules. But of course everything was normal, I almost wanted it not to be. Wanted my eyes to be leaking, I dunno, oil. So at least I could identify the problem area. I left the bathroom in a bad headspace. I was certain the mind had to be the issue so I went back to my seat to check the one thing I hadn’t, the sky itself. When I got back time had oddly passed like normal, to me I was gone 5 minutes and the same for my husband. This reassured me for all of 5 seconds. As a moment later I opened and looked out of my window, what awaited me was a nightmare. 

Outside of the window was the ocean and a building. Not just any building, it was my house. The unimaginable brings a certain kind of fear, most fear you can think you’re way out of. But I was in the sky looking out of a plane and I was underwater. Not only was I underwater but so was my house. I screamed. More in shock than anything else, people looked at me like I was crazy, my own husband. He obviously didn’t believe me. No one did, no one saw it. I tried and tried but I couldn’t trick myself into ignoring it. I tried to just sit down and relax but I kept on coming back to it. I knew that on the other side of the window was the impossible. So I looked again. 

The same incomprehensible display but this time I looked closer. Studied it looking for anything to alleviate my concerns. The opposite happened. In the window of my house, top floor, my bedroom, there was a woman. She was naked, a thin layer of mould covering her from head to toe. Her hair was frail and her eyes were leaking oil. She was vacantly staring out of the window until she locked eyes with me. She saw me and I saw her, the real her. She was me. Unrecognisable but I knew, I could sense it. When she saw me she began smashing her head into the window again and again until a clear liquid started forming as a wound opened up in her head. She began screaming and I could hear it from inside the plane. I quickly closed my eyes and covered my ears with my hands. 

Immediately my husband grabbed my hands and held them in his. He asked if I was okay. I hesitantly opened my eyes meeting his, he then told me that we landed. My immediate reaction was relief, it was just one insane dream during a long flight. I gathered myself and looked out the window, he was right. I was on ground again and I couldn’t be happier. So I slipped back into normalcy, excited for my holiday more than anything. We left the plane, went through all the rigamarole of airport security. I ignored most of it, letting my husband lead me, I was caught up in the moment and his surprising jovial energy was infectious. It wasn’t until baggage when I realised where I was. 

I was in Heathrow airport, the same airport I just left. The holiday had happened. I began rattling off increasingly insane questions to my husband and he simply laughed, he told me that I warned him about this. That I apparently would get like this once we landed. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, I couldn’t believe what had happened. Until we got home I was pretty much catatonic. I felt hopeless, there was nothing I could do, there was nothing. It had happened and no one would ever believe me. 

I entered the front door of my house, went to my bedroom and collapsed. My husband was unbothered, he seemingly expected this. When I went to sleep I prayed that it was a dream, that all of it was a dream. Maybe I’d wake up before we even got on the first plane, maybe in L.A. I didn’t want to wake up back on the plane, didn’t want to be trapped there again. When I eventually woke up, I was in my house, wearing the same clothes I just slept in. I screamed into my pillow. When I was done screaming I got up, honestly ready to push everything aside. Sure I was insane for a week but as long as it stopped I was okay with it. I got out of bed and opened my curtains read to be hit by the dreary English sunshine. But that didn’t greet me. Instead I saw an ocean and on the other side of the ocean was a plane.
