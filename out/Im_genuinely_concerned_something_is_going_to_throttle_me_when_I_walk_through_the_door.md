I really can't continue living like this. The stress it's causing me will seemingly never end. People never believe me when I tell them what's going on, but it's all true, I swear. You might think it's crazy, but I don't give a shit, I just need to write this out (as if that would achieve anything, other than just pushing the thoughts back into my head)

Sometimes when I close a door, I hear the sound of rushed footsteps behind me and the sound of someone breathing rapidly. Sometimes when I'm walking through the front door after coming home, sometimes when I'm going to bed, even getting into the car in some random carpark late at night, I hear the footsteps. It's someone rushing up behind me like I'm about to be mugged or stabbed or something, but I'm too afraid to look behind me, so I just hurry through the door and close it behind me. Sometimes I even feel a wind behind me or feel my clothing move. Once or twice it's felt like someone grabbed me by the collar of my shirt or jacket, but lost their grip.

So far nothing bad has happened, and if I'm being honest, I don't know if anything bad *will* happen, but I don't want to stand still and find out because the thought terrifies me. This has been happening for months now. At first it was just sounds that you could attribute to a creaky floorboard or the house settling or maybe even the rustle of my own pants, but over time it got more and more distinct and more physical. Now it's definitely the sound of someone trying to rush me. It doesn't happen every time I close a door, but that just makes it worse, because I'll be having an otherwise normal day, and moments later I'll be sitting on the bed, shaking and nearly hysterical, looking at the light filtering in from under the door, expecting to see the shadow of a person and hear the oh so familiar sound of the doorknob turning. But nobody is ever there. The sound just stops when I'm through the door.

Right now this doesn't happen when I close the fridge or the cupboard or cabinet doors or whatever, but how long will it be before it happens then? How long will it be before I'm throttled from behind, a strong vice-like sensation around my neck, strangled until the world turns black and my wife comes in to find me face down on the floor? Would it come for her after that? Or is it only me it wants, whatever "it" may be? 

When I try and sleep, sleep does eventually come, but it takes a long time and I have nightmares about standing in the hallway and seeing a shadow that is darker than dark, lunging at me with an obscenely graceful, inhuman speed that wakes me up in a terrified, sweaty mess of tangled blankets.

I honestly don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. Everyone I've spoken to doesn't want anything to do with me. My wife doesn't like me bringing it up, so I don't. Psychologists don't seem interested hearing me out, exorcists say they're too busy, paranormal investigators straight up ignore me. It's pushing me further and further off the cliff. I want to have 24 straight hours where I'm not feeling like I'm going to have my throat slit because I decided to stop and look at my watch for a moment before entering a room. 



Help. Me.
