It started so small I barely noticed.

A girl dropped her books in the hallway. They tumbled, heavy, papers fluttering across the tile. Before she could even bend down, I was there. Picking them up, stacking them, handing them back. She looked at me like it mattered. I told myself it did. I still tell myself that.

After that, I noticed more. A door swinging shut just as someone hurried forward. A backpack strap sliding toward the floor. A pencil rolling across a desk. Most people walked right past. I stepped in. I was always there. They thanked me, looked at me differently. That feeling, it was necessary.

The boy in gym class. Pale face, wobbling knees. I was already beside him when he collapsed. No one else moved. I eased him down, called for help. They said it was luck. Lucky I was watching. Watching is not luck. Watching is responsibility.

The girl on the stairs. Her shoe caught the edge of a step. She pitched forward. My hands were there before she could hit the ground. Her heart shook under my fingertips. She didn’t even know I was behind her. I don’t know if I should even remember that moment. But I do.

Then the fire. I smelled it before anyone else. The sharp, acrid sting of smoke from the chemistry lab. Alarms screaming. Students coughing, gasping. Chaos. I pulled two students into the hallway, another fell and I caught her arms. Sirens, sprinklers hissing. The principal shook my hand. Cameras flashed. Hero.

Hero. That word felt heavier than it should. I told myself it did not matter. I whispered it in my head until it sounded like someone else was saying it. It made sense. It had to.

After that, everything became noticeable. The ceiling light above the cafeteria swayed slightly as if it had grown impatient. A locker slammed shut harder than it should. A faint hiss near the lunch line caught my attention. Screws loose where they should have been tight. Cracks forming in paint, unnoticed by anyone else.

Did I notice them too late? Did I cause them? I can’t tell anymore. I tell myself I didn’t. I must have just been observing. I must have been paying attention. Someone has to notice. Someone has to help.

The gas leak. I smelled it before anyone else. My eyes lingered on the pipes, tracing each connection, each tiny fracture. Everything was fragile. Everything could fail. If I didn’t pay attention, if I wasn’t there, someone would get hurt. I wouldn’t allow that.

The bus crash. I don’t remember why I walked that morning. Maybe I knew. Maybe it was instinct. The bus skidded, tires squealing on ice, metal bending, glass cracking. I was there. Crawled through a shattered window, pulled students out one by one. Their hands clutching mine, their tears soaking my sleeve. They whispered I was meant to be there.

Meant to be there. They don’t know. I don’t think they can know. I can’t think about that part. It’s better if I don’t.

Now the school is empty. The lights hum above me, the tile cold beneath my shoes. My fingers brush the lockers as I walk. I trace the dents and scratches, the marks that weren’t here before. Or were they? I don’t remember. Maybe I caused them without realizing it. Maybe that thought is dangerous. I push it away. Someone has to notice. Someone has to help.

If you stand still, you can feel the building breathe. The low thrum in the pipes. The subtle vibrations under the floors. Everything waiting. Everything ready.

And I think about the little things I notice every day. Flaws no one else sees. The dangers lurking in plain sight. How close everything is to failing. How much depends on me noticing. If I weren’t here, who would notice? Who would save them? No one. No one would.

Tomorrow, the halls will be full again. Lockers slamming, shoes squeaking, laughter echoing. Something will go wrong. It always does. And I’ll be there. I’ll steady trembling hands. I’ll pull people to safety. I’ll fix what no one else sees is broken.

They will thank me. Like they always do.

I press my palm against the wall. The vibration hums beneath my skin. Alive, patient, almost breathing. I whisper into the emptiness, into the silence, into the building itself.

Someone has to help.
