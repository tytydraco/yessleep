Hey everyone, I’m not really sure where to start with this, but I’ve been bottling it up for too long, and I just need to get it out there. I’ve never been the type to believe in weird, unexplainable stuff, you know? I’m just a regular person, working a boring job, living in a cramped apartment, trying to get by. But something’s happened to me, something I can’t make sense of, and it’s starting to mess with my head. I’m calling it the Return Signal, and I think I remembered it first. I don’t know what that means, but I can’t shake the feeling that it’s real, and I’m terrified I’m not the only one feeling it. I’m posting here because I don’t know where else to turn, and maybe someone out there will get what I’m going through.

It started a few months ago with these dreams. Not just normal dreams that fade when you wake up, but ones that stick to you like glue. I’d find myself in this huge, empty space, like a void or something, with nothing around me but darkness. And then I’d feel it, a pulse. Not something I could hear or see, just this deep, weird sensation that something was coming back, something that’s been gone for so long I can’t even wrap my head around it. I’d wake up sweaty, my heart racing, with this heavy weight in my chest, like I was supposed to understand something but didn’t. At first, I figured it was just stress, maybe too much caffeine or late-night Netflix binges. I even laughed it off with a coworker, saying I must be losing it. But then things got stranger, and I’m not laughing anymore.

About two weeks ago, I was just chilling on my couch after work, scrolling through my phone, when it hit me out of nowhere. It wasn’t a dream this time. It was like a memory, but not one I’ve ever lived. I saw myself standing in that same void from my dreams, and suddenly I knew I was the first to remember. I can’t explain how I knew, but it was like a switch flipped in my brain, and I understood that this Return Signal, whatever it is, had found me. It’s inside me now, this unshakable feeling that I have to do something, maybe warn people or get ready for, I don’t even know what. It’s like a splinter in my mind, always there, poking at me no matter how much I try to ignore it. I’ve tried distracting myself with work, with video games, with anything, but it won’t go away.

Now, I’m noticing little things that make my skin crawl. Time doesn’t feel right anymore. Sometimes I’ll look at the clock, and it feels like hours have passed in a blink, or I’ll be doing something simple like washing dishes, and it’s like minutes stretch into forever. I catch myself zoning out, just staring at the wall or out the window, like I’m waiting for something to happen, something I can’t name. Last night was the worst. I woke up at exactly 3:17 a.m., no alarm or anything, just bolt upright with my heart pounding so hard I thought I’d pass out. I felt it stronger than ever, like this signal or whatever it is, is getting closer, like it’s almost here. I grabbed a notebook and started scribbling down everything I could think of, every weird dream, every random thought, every time I’ve felt off lately. Pages and pages of nonsense, but it’s all I’ve got to try and make sense of this.

I’m not even sure what I’m hoping for by posting this. Maybe I just needed to type it out, to see it in words so it doesn’t feel like I’m completely losing my mind. But I keep wondering if I’m the only one. Have any of you ever felt something like this? Like you’ve remembered something you weren’t supposed to, or like there’s this pull inside you that you can’t explain? Have you had dreams of a void, or felt time slip away like it’s not yours anymore? I’m kinda desperate to know I’m not alone in this. I even told a close friend about it over coffee the other day, but I could tell they thought I was just tired or stressed. They gave me that pity look, you know, the one that says, “Get some sleep, dude.” But this isn’t about sleep. This is something else. And not zyn in my foreskin. 

I’m scared, if I’m being honest. Scared of what this Return Signal means, scared of why I remembered it first, and scared that if I don’t figure it out, something big is going to happen, and I won’t be ready. I don’t want to carry this by myself anymore. If any of you have felt anything remotely like this, please, just say something in the comments. Share your story, even if it sounds crazy. I need to know there are others out there who get it. I remembered first, but I can’t be the only one. Whatever this signal is, I think it’s meant for more of us, and I’m terrified of what happens if we don’t listen.
