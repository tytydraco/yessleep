I couldn't believe [what had happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cq87q1/im_a_single_mom_i_never_knew_who_the_donor_was/).

There was a time when a man could anonymously donate sperm, to be used for artificial insemination, and no one would ever find out who the father was.

But with the advent of home DNA kits, curious offspring were given the opportunity to track down their biological fathers, by comparing their DNA with that of strangers to find matches. And the closer the match, the closer the relative.

So when the nurse from the fertility clinic, Ryan McDonald, informed me that my donor-conceived son, was one of ten "spawns" of "The Donor," a man so evil, that every one of his children turned into killers at the age of seven... I knew what I had to do.

And when the DNA test results came back with a 25% match... I knew where I had to go.

"What do you want?" Constance, the old woman at the door, answered dismissively. "If you're looking for Cassius, he hasn't lived here in over a decade."

*Cassius?* I wondered. *Could that be the name of my son's father? And who else has been looking for him?*

"Is Cassius your son, ma'am?" I asked.

"Yes, but I haven't heard from him in years. So if you're looking for a lead, I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place."

"A lead?" I replied.

"You're not a journalist? Like the one who came here before?" She asked, confused by my intentions.

I went on to explain to her how I had become pregnant seven years prior by way of artificial insemination using the sperm of an anonymous donor. An anonymous donor, who I suspected was her son.

She immediately invited me inside.

—

"A grandson?" She called out with a smile, as she poured me a cup of tea, her wrinkled eyes nearly welling up with tears. "I wasn't aware that my son had any children."

I considered telling her that she actually had ten grandchildren, but I knew that it would open up a... difficult conversation.

That's when I realized that if she didn't know about the children, then the journalist must have been looking for something else.

"If you don't mind my asking, ma'am. What was the journalist looking for?"

"He was asking about the compound."

"The compound?"

"Where Cassius lives. Turns out after he left home years ago, he bought a plot of land in Utah, and has turned it into some sort of a..."

*Cult.* I thought to myself. I knew that's what it must have been. And deep down inside, I knew she did too. But she couldn't bear to say it.

"...Religious center."

"What kind of religion?"

"To be honest, I don't know. The journalist claimed he received a lead that something suspicious was going on in there. But he wasn't able to get inside, in order to prove it. And I know if I gave him the address, word would get it out, and bad things could happen to my son."

"But maybe there's nothing to it. Maybe it's just a religious center."

"Cassius was a... troubled boy. At an early age, he demonstrated signs of... violence, anger, hate. I tried to find him help, but he left home before I could, never to return."

*Fuck.* I thought to myself, realizing that my son's biological father was a "spawn" himself.

"If you don't mind my asking, ma'am. Who was Cassius' father?"

That's when her tone... changed. "I'm sorry, Ms. Birch. I'm afraid I must be going. It has been lovely to meet you, and I do hope to meet David someday."

"Well, I can bring him tomorrow if you're-"

"I'm afraid I'm much too busy!" She barked with a scowl, as she hopped up from her seat, put her arm around mine, and led me to the front door.

That night I couldn't sleep. The very idea that the monstrous father of my child was out there somewhere, while poor David was in the condition that he was, terrified me to no end.

But at the same time, I knew that the only way to find answers, and potentially cure my son, was to visit the literal belly of the beast itself. To visit Cassius' compound.

And after having no luck tracking down its address on my own, I begrudgingly reached out to my ex husband, Carl, for the first time in over seven years. He did, after all, have way better resources than me, what with him being a cop and all, a profession that... complicated things during the darkest days of our toxic relationship.

My body returning to fight or flight, I expected him to tell me to fuck off, or worse, but after seeing David, he simply... agreed to help. His empathy instantly brought me back to all the good times we had once shared, and my breathing slowed.

"Do you want me to go with you?" Carl offered, as he handed me the address to the compound.

But despite how nice it felt to see my ex husband's good side again, I couldn't help but recall the years of screaming and terror that he'd brought into my life, and couldn't bear to complicate an already... complicated situation.

And after several attempts to reach out to Ryan, who had seemingly disappeared, I was left with no other choice but to seek out Cassius alone.

The next day, I was on a train to Utah, in a private car with a restrained David, holding an address provided to me by my ex husband.

An hour after arriving at the station, we were standing at the gates of a massive compound in the middle of the desert, the home of the biological father of my possessed child.

Fearing what horror horrors lay inside, I eventually willed myself to approach the intercom, and announce who I was...

…Suddenly...

...The gates opened.

—

Inside... was even worse than I feared.

Upon first entry, I met a tall man, whose back was so hunched that he appeared short, and who greeted me as if he had been expecting me.

Without saying anything, he led me down a long hallway, lit by torches, to a great hall, where what must have been a hundred women in white gowns knelt before an ancient obelisk, chanting ominously, over and over and over... the very sound of which, sent chills down my spine.

"You can partake soon enough." The sickly man snickered, as he led me out of the room, and down another hallway, to a chamber, where a man was sitting alone in the darkness.

"Mary." He greeted me, with hollow eyes, and a disheveled beard, before turning to my son. "And David. I'm so glad you made it. I'm Cassius."

He then stood up, and began to approach David, who immediately began snarling and growling at him, his teeth grinding ferociously, hungry to tear the flesh off of his biological father's bones.

"That is the downside to them." Cassius said. "They even want to kill me."

"Them?" I asked.

"Yes, the spawns. Like your son."

"What have you done to him? And why?" I screamed, my body shaking from both fear and anger.

"Perfect timing. You'll soon find out." He replied, before heading back towards the hallway that I had just come from, and gesturing for me to follow him.

—

We returned to the great hall, where Cassius stood before all of the chanting women. Immediately, all of them went quiet.

"Mothers!" He cried out. "It is time for the feeding!"

*Feeding?* I wondered. But before I could lose myself in the thought, Cassius had turned to an adjacent hallway, where an extremely old man, whose sickly body resembled a corpse but appeared to be blinking, was being wheeled out by other women.

"Father." Cassius whispered soft enough as to not startle the old man, but loud enough for the others to hear. "Who is to be fed tonight?"

That's when the seemingly sedentary old man suddenly raised his finger, began waving it around the room, and ultimately pointed to the back of the hall, where one of the women was kneeling.

And without any resistance, she simply stood up, calmly walked over to Cassius and his father, and followed them, as they began to leave the room.

"Come, Mary." My son's biological father commanded, before disappearing into another dark hallway.

—

When we arrived on the other side, I was terrified to discover a large pit, filled with countless children, all snarling and howling. Each of them acting exactly like David, but somehow, not attacking each other.

*How are there this many of them?* I wondered. *Ryan had told me there were only ten.*

And as the children saw us approaching the ledge that dropped off into the pit, all of them came charging over, screaming and drooling like a dog fiending for a bone.

That's when Cassius set his father's wheelchair aside, and, along with the tall, thin man, led the chosen woman to the edge of the pit.

"For Father." He said to the complacent woman, making a strange symbol with his finger, before pushing her off the ledge, and into the sea of possessed children.

And like that, all of the feral spawns began tearing at her flesh with their hands and teeth, ripping her apart, blood spraying everywhere, as she screamed out in pain...

...Until she was no more.

I nearly vomited over the side of the ledge.

"Feel better, Father?" His son asked, patting him on the shoulder.

The sickly old man simply nodded, as Cassius turned back to me.

"Do you see now, why we do what we do?"

I didn't know what to say. I tried to say something, anything, and to scream, but no matter how hard I tried, I was frozen in fear.

"Throw him in!" Cassius said to the thin man, as he pointed at David.

"Noooo!" I was finally able to cry out.

But it was too late...

...The hunched man had already removed David from his restraints, and tossed him down into the pit, where he immediately blended into the crowd of ravenous children, like a fish thrown back into a stream.

"And what shall we do with her?" The thin man asked Cassius.

"Get her a gown, and prepare her for service." The biological father of my son decreed, [as they carried me off, screaming, into the darkness.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1danrq3/im_a_single_mom_i_never_knew_who_the_donor_was/)
