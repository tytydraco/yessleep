I couldn't believe [what had happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cq87q1/im_a_single_mom_i_never_knew_who_the_donor_was/).

There was a time when a man could anonymously donate sperm, to be used for artificial insemination, and no one would ever find out who the father was.

But with the advent of home DNA kits, curious offspring were given the opportunity to track down their biological fathers, by comparing their DNA with that of strangers to find matches. And the closer the match, the closer the relative.

So when the nurse from the fertility clinic, Ryan McDonald, informed me that my donor-conceived son, was one of ten "spawns" of "The Donor," a man so evil, that every one of his children turned into killers at the age of seven... I knew what I had to do.

And when the DNA test results came back with a 25% match... I knew where I had to go.

"What do you want?" Constance, the old woman at the door, answered dismissively. "If you're looking for Cassius, he hasn't lived here in over a decade."

*Cassius?* I wondered. *Could that be the name of my son's father? And who else has been looking for him?*

"Is Cassius your son, ma'am?" I asked.

"Yes, but I haven't heard from him in years. So if you're looking for a lead, I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place."

"A lead?" I replied.

"You're not a journalist? Like the one who came here before?" She asked, confused by my intentions.

I went on to explain to her how I had become pregnant seven years prior by way of artificial insemination using the sperm of an anonymous donor. An anonymous donor, who I suspected was her son.

She immediately invited me inside.

"A grandson?" She called out with a smile, as she poured me a cup of tea, her wrinkled eyes nearly welling up with tears. "I wasn't aware that my son had any children."

I considered telling her that she actually had ten grandchildren, but I knew that it would open up a... difficult conversation.

That's when I realized that if she didn't know about the children, then the journalist must have been looking for something else.

"If you don't mind my asking, ma'am. What was the journalist looking for?"

"He was asking about the compound."

"The compound?"

"Where Cassius lives. Turns out after he left home years ago, he bought a plot of land in Utah, and has turned it into some sort of a..."

*Cult.* I thought to myself. I knew that's what it must have been. And deep down inside, I knew she did too. But she couldn't bear to say it.

"...Religious center."

"What kind of religion?"

"To be honest, I don't know. The journalist claimed he received a lead that something suspicious was going on in there. But he wasn't able to get inside, in order to prove it. And I know if I gave him the address, word would get it out, and bad things could happen to my son."

"But maybe there's nothing to it. Maybe it's just a religious center."

"Cassius was a... troubled boy. At an early age, he demonstrated signs of... violence, anger, hate. I tried to find him help, but he left home before I could, never to return."

*Fuck.* I thought to myself, realizing that my son's biological father was a "spawn" himself.

"If you don't mind my asking, ma'am. Who was Cassius' father?"

That's when her tone... changed. "I'm sorry, Ms. Birch. I'm afraid I must be going. It has been lovely to meet you, and I do hope to meet David someday."

"Well, I can bring him tomorrow if you're-"

"I'm afraid I'm much too busy!" She barked with a scowl, as she hopped up from her seat, put her arm around mine, and led me to the front door.

As I hopped in my car, defeated, I knew that the only way to get to the bottom of what was really going on, and to cure David, was to find Cassius. *But how the fuck can I find him?* I wondered.

And after several attempts to reach out to Ryan, who had seemingly disappeared, I was left with no other choice but to go to my ex husband, Carl.

The next day, I was once again sitting in my car, this time parked outside my ex husband's home, shaking, as my son growled and wriggled in the back seat, his arms and legs restrained in order to prevent him from hurting anyone.

"You have some nerve." Carl exclaimed, his words immediately returning me to our emotionally abusive marriage, and sending adrenaline pouring through my body. "I haven't seen you in years, Mary. And you come here with this nonsense?"

That's when I had no other choice, but to bring David inside.

"What the fuck!" Carl cried out, as I let David out of his restraints, and he immediately charged at my ex husband, grasping for his throat, his arms flailing.

I pulled my son away before he could do any damage and, with Carl's help, restrained him again.

Upon seeing David's condition, my ex husband’s demeanor changed from that of anger, to shock.

"But how could this happen?" He asked, genuinely concerned how such a young child could become so feral, so... rabid.

And so, after telling Carl everything, from David's birth to my visit from Ryan to my encounter with Cassius' mother, and begging for his help, I expected my ex to laugh the story off, or tell me to go fuck off. But he simply agreed.

"Alright, I'll look up this Cassius guy's address in the system when I go to the precinct tonight." He offered.

Truth is, Carl was a police officer. Which had... complicated things back when we were fighting.

"I'm sorry that this happened to you. And him." He said, glancing at me, then David, a look of both fear, and concern in his eyes.

His empathy instantly brought me back to all the good times we had once shared, and my breathing slowed.

"Do you want me to go with you?" He asked.

But despite how nice it felt to see Carl's good side again, I couldn't help but recall the years of screaming and terror that he'd brought into my life, and couldn't bear to complicate an already... complicated situation.

The next day, I was on a train to Utah, in a private car with a restrained David, holding an address provided to me by my ex husband.

An hour after arriving at the station, we were standing at the gates of the compound, the home of the biological father of my possessed child, where I could only hope I could find answers.

And after announcing who I was over the intercom…

…Suddenly...

...The gates opened.
