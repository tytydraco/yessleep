I have no breath to scream with.

*My lungs have not inhaled for the past minute. My legs are threatening to detonate. My stomach feels like it’s been torn apart with a blender, my heart could be demolishing my ribcage with how hard it’s pounding, my eyes seen nothing but starbursts-*

“Quiet now.” Allie’s hand laid across my mouth, muffling my screams.

The car stopped.

\---

I did some research on this place the day before. There seems to be nothing but hearsay about who owned it, what happened in it. Only a single newspaper article from half a century ago of what happened to it.

A fire broke out at night, trapping around twenty family members within. All perished.

I sent the article to Allie, who replied: “Served them right- that hill could barely pass a small car through, let alone several fire trucks. The firemen had to *hike* up there, only to find a burnt out shell. The fire had raged for the whole night.”

Wait, how did you know that? “Grandmother was a distant relative.”

*My* grandma, on the other hand, suggested that I take an umbrella. It makes a serviceable club, plus opening it could hold them off. Also, the roof’s probably gone and it’s December.

I *really* shouldn’t be doing this.

\---

Our dear club leader handed out activity sheets. They talk about finding mudskippers, crabs and empty bleach bottles in the wetlands in 2022 by the Nature Club.

“There’s police tape wrapped around the door,” remarked Akemi, tapping on a piece of paper. “The manor’s structurally unsound, this notice says; a stiff breeze could collapse it!”

“It hasn’t, has it?” He pushed on the great iron gate, which against all its rust creaked open. Then he reached for his shirt pocket. “Come on now, there are more things on heaven and-”

“And I’d rather live to see them,” Allie quipped irritably.

\---

One would think that a group of four can’t be split no more. Especially if one of them was explicitly tasked with protecting the other three. Even if the place was horrifically big; *especially* if the place was horrifically big.

Instead he declared that it’d be easier to find something if we split up, ignored *everyone’s* concerns about doing the one infamous horror cliché, and handed Allie an EMF reader.

So now the two of us were stuck on the left side of this place, me waving an *ofuda* I couldn’t use, her waving a constantly beeping box of lights.

—

“What was he THINKING?! What, did we not deserve the protection reserved for our Dear Leader?” Was talking loudly reasonable with potentially hostile spirits? My mind harkens back to that dream.

“I have a therapist suite, if you need it.”

“Something tells me I will…” I replied.

Allie stayed silent, waving the EMF reader about- suddenly she stopped, handing the thing backwards at me.

“I am radiating electromagnetic waves myself- how about you try?”

I took the thing. She proceeded to vanish, landing somewhere I couldn’t see with a *thump*. “I’ll be on high alert- don’t worry.”

I really should, you’re about ten miles away. How did you even move that fast anyway?!

But with a sigh, I got to work.

There really wasn’t much to see there. The windows were gone, some leaving shards on the frames, softened by wind and rain. The ground was made out of twisted metal, charcoal and muddy puddles. The walls are crumbling, the ceiling has collapsed, I could see the moon from there.

Again, why would anyone build this place? Let their family live here? How did they buy groceries? How did they interact with the outside world, if they ever got the chance to? Did no one see the risks of emergencies becoming tragedies?

 

No sign of anything.

“Allie? You there?” I called out. No response.

Calm down, she’s probably playing with me. I’ve been through that enough. So I kept walking, thanking my mum for insisting that I wear rainboots.

The device started beeping. It’s probably a false alarm.

It kept going.

Dear god oh dear god is it going to kill me how do I use *ofuda* anyway should I back off no it’s probably faster than me oh god-

“Hello-” I jam the *ofuda* directly towards the sound. She proceeded to shriek loudly, clutching her arm.

 

Somehow knowing that that was friendly fire didn’t reduce my satisfaction by one bit.

“christ, i somehow felt remorse just now.” “Hope the lesson sticks, Allison.”

She smirked, still painfully. “nope.”

… wait what? “What, exactly, happened? You’re not a ghost, are you?”

“One second I was jumping out, the next it was like my very *soul* was being scoured.” Gently nursing her arm: “I will need time to fix my arm- in the meantime I can no longer cover for you.”

“Good, be my meatshield like you promised. Ironshield? Gearshield?”

“For a harmless-”

 

*“Hello?”* Faint. Vaguely tinny. Vaguely female, teenaged. Sounds scared. Forlorn.

Were any of the fire victims teenaged females? I point my umbrella at the sound.

*“Are you here to catch me?”*

…catch? Wouldn’t those victims be *happy* to hear someone coming for them?

“Who are you?” I call out. “Will you please show yourself?” I hear the sound of scalpel blades locking in place. “We mean no harm!”

*“If only I knew… who am I… who am I…”*

I took out another *ofuda* from my pocket. The only other one I had.

“Namo Amitabha… Namo Amitabha… bless me with peace and safety…” I heard myself say.

“Show yourself now,” Allie declared instead, “or I will end- wait, that would not have-”

*“You are here to kill me? What have I done wrong in my life?”*

“I sincerely apologize,” she said, dropping the blade. “Put down the paper talisman.” I had to oblige.

You may have doomed us all, I glared at her. She closed her eyes in admission.

Namo Amitabha! *Namo Amitabha!*

 

Slowly a figure emerged from one of those emptied rooms- Maybe I could take the *ofuda* back out fast enough? Maybe it would kill me if I tried.

\-to reveal, shambling, staggering, sparking, cloaked in tattered robes-

\-no older than I was?
