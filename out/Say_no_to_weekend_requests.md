My work is great…

I love it….

I used to be a contractor in Texas. Now if you know anything about Texas, it’s that hellish summers come early and long, and frigid attic cold is the in between. It’s rare when you have just A cool day to enjoy Texas. 


It’s why I eventually gave everything up as a contractor, Not to mention the back taxes, and became a “supply chain technician”. It was a position at some up and coming lab company. It was the pay check, the cold ac year round, and that whole “start up” vibe. 


You know the one, where they install a real pizza oven and bar, have nap times, and other crazy things you’d see at companies like that browsing company that rhymes with ogle. Companies like this only ever succeed or fail miserably. Im glad to say that we’ve been going strong for almost 10 years. 


We recently bought a new building as a company. It big, bigger than I ever thought we needed. However, we’re expanding, we need space, we need teams of supply guys to run it, and I want to lead one of those teams eventually. I’ve been yes manning requests to get that shot.


I work on the weekends. Being recently divorced, I have time to adjust my schedule to my needs, and the company appreciated that. It comes with lazy days of “work”, but sometimes I have to do some projects on my own which can be a real pain. 


However, I do get some requests, sometimes I drop off things, sometimes I have to reorganize shelving, and sometimes, I have to do things other people can do, they just don’t want to. 


I guess that’s just how it goes as a “supply chain technician”.  People don’t think you’re important, and they think, “they’re free, get them to do it”. I am free but I don’t want to drive across town for thirty minutes to do something you can do. 


That’s what I’m doing now with a coworker. 
Ya see, they’re new, and need to see what I’ll be doing so they can do it later. I did the same thing when I was training with my older coworker. He was reassigned to another warehouse we have out this way too. He was a nice old guy, but he was set in his way, and could be mean if he lost his patience with you. Still, he was a good trainer, it’s why I’m so good at what I do now. 


I’m always amazed when I pull up to the half occupied building. Half of it is schedule for demo, the other half contains our “big brains” and the over bloated HR staff that have no problem taking any little thing and making it another global tragedy. I’ve had a couple run ins with them. 
 

But now to the reason why I’m parking on the street and leaving my trainee here, incase they need to move the vehicle, outside of a locked building with no one around for miles. My boss’s boss asked me to do him a favor for his boss. I had to move a couple boxes from one room, to a secured room. Why couldn’t the people already there do it? Why did I need to spend a hour long round trip to do it? Why is my key fob not working on this lock?  I don’t know. 


I just know I need to do this for the sake of my promotion I know is coming down the line. I take out my phone and message my boss’s boss. It doesn’t take him long to reply. There’s a keypad he says, he sends me the code next. I nod. Then I go exploring. I try my key fob in every door around this massive building. And none work. I was about to call it quits when I see a slightly ajar door and think, no fucking way! 


Believe it or not, some idiot had left the back door around the building open.  I can’t tell you how relieved I was to open the door, smell the musty old smell of a pre demo building and know this would be remembered when I got my next raise. 


I stepped inside and thought to myself. This is dangerous, a huge security issue, someone should’ve kept this door closed. 


I didn’t realize it then, but I recognize it now. I’m not lucky enough for something good to come my way, something so fortuitous. I am unlucky enough for what happened next.
