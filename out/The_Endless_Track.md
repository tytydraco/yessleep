I’ve never liked Halloween. Trick-or-treaters, tacky costumes, plastic skeletons—it grated on me. I'd never liked the holiday, but living in Australia it was never really a big deal, so I could easily ignore it. But I despised how it had started seeping into Australia from the States, another capitalist bloated holiday that had strayed so far from its origin.

Last year, despite having not one horrid decoration littering my property, my door was banged on relentlessly throughout the night by hordes of trick-or-treaters and their obnoxious parents. Some of the older children weren’t happy when I told them to fuck off through the door and proceeded to tip my bins and kick down my letter box.

Kids will be kids, was all the operator said when I called the police. Useless.

So this year, I booked a trip out of the city and as far from civilization as I could.

A train ride through Australia’s remote outback for four days and nights.

I was a little irritated that the ticket booth at the station had some cheesy fake cobwebs and spiders in the windows, but thankful once I boarded to see no sign of Halloween.

This train ride across the Outback was my escape, a few days of quiet where I’d see nothing but wilderness, desert, and the occasional old ghost town.

It didn’t take long to leave civilization behind, and as I ventured further inland, the landscape slowly changed from green bushland to dry grass, before even the dryest of grasses could not survive. Outside, endless stretches of red earth now blurred by, sparse trees and bushes dotting the landscape. I let the steady, rhythmic hum of the train lull me into a trance, watching as the scenery stretched on, uninterrupted.

I enjoyed dinner with my own company, reading a book while occasionally stealing glances outside the window. The horizon glowed like molten metal as the Australian sun lowered itself across the desert's dry, sandy surface.

Day two we stopped briefly in a small town, population twelve, before boarding again and heading further towards the center of Australia. I had browsed the wares there and picked up a couple of books from the local pub-slash-post office-slash-restaurant-slash-convenience store.

I sat down in a comfy seat, popped in my headphones to listen to some classical music, and began skimming the books I had picked up.

Normally, I would stick to autobiographies, classic tales, or true stories. The selection in the town wasn’t the greatest, but one book there was about true Australian unsolved mysteries. It was a collection of stories, a lot of which were focused on the Australian outback. Most were suspected kidnappings, murders, that sort of thing. A couple were around alien sightings and abductions, something I had heard of in Australia but was not really interested in, and one discussed ley lines.

Now, I’d never heard of a ley line before, so this piqued my interest a little. I dove into this story and found out that ley lines are theoretical alignments that some believe connect various ancient, sacred, or significant sites across a landscape. Some even believe that these ley lines may have spiritual, healing, or even supernatural properties. And apparently, Australia had them cris-crossing all over the outback, with a couple of particular ones that were considered extremely powerful.

It went on to explain a range of supposed incidents on or near these ley lines – Creatures, UFOs, voices in the desert – even a story of a small mining town, Langarra, that was at the intersection of a ley line that completely disappeared in the early 1900s. Not just the residents, but the entire town.

As I finished up the story, the train suddenly went dark as we entered a tunnel. I placed the book back on the table and leaned back in my chair as the lights in the cabin flickered on. The train raced through the tunnel before emerging out the other side, the bright Australian sun temporarily blinding me.

The train rumbled on. The red sand desert was broken occasionally by old buildings, rusted cars, and gnarled trees, as I stared out the window, not really paying attention as I daydreamed. My mind was caught up in replaying the events of last Halloween, and how I was so glad to be here, not home, this time round. Today was the 31^(st), and while it was still early, soon my neighborhood would be overrun by trick or treaters, and while I was here, a thousand kilometers away, the thought of it irritated me and started to get me wound up.

I took a deep breath and decided to close my eyes and relax. I turned up the volume of the classical music and tried to clear my mind, letting the rumble of the train and the symphony of the orchestra blend together, rising and falling in a calming rhythm.

I’m not sure how long I slept, though I definitely did sleep, as a completely new song was playing when I opened my eyes. It was dark again, and at first, I thought maybe I had slept the entire afternoon away before I was suddenly hit again with the bright Australian sun as the train exited another tunnel.

I took my headphones out and stood up to stretch. I contemplated going to my room for a bit but decided I would just stay here. I looked around the carriage at the other guests, most of whom were staring longingly out the windows at the desert, smiles on their faces, before doing one more stretch and sitting down again.

I’m not sure how many times we had passed it before I noticed it. But I know we had gone through maybe two more tunnels before something clicked.

We passed by a large, gnarled tree, this one blackened, possibly from a fire or lightning strike. I had seen a similar one earlier out the window, just before we had passed by a small mining town.

It’s not that rare to see them, so I don’t know why, but I felt a knot start to form in my stomach. Something told me it wasn’t just a similar tree, but it was the same tree.

I looked ahead, and the knot tightened as I could see a small town looming in the distance.

Just a coincidence, I told myself, trying to brush it off.

I hadn’t paid much attention to the last town we went through, but I could not have been more alert this time.

It appeared deserted, though in well-kept condition considering. Some paint appeared peeled here and there, but overall, it seemed like a very tidy, quaint little town. There would have been no more than 20 buildings lining a single main road. There was a welcome sign, but I had been staring intently at the buildings, looking for any sign of life, and had missed the name on the sign.

An hour passed, and the train continued winding along the rusty tracks, cutting through abandoned buildings and barren stretches of desert. As we approached a tunnel, a strange sense of unease bubbled up. I watched as the train slipped into darkness and took a deep breath, trying to calm myself, counting the seconds until we emerged on the other side.

When the light broke, I blinked, feeling a sense of déjà vu. I told myself of course it looked familiar, it’s the outback, the whole thing looks familiar. That did little to temper my rising anxiety.

It didn’t take long to confirm my worst fear. There it was again—the twisted tree, exactly as I remembered, its branches frozen in the same eerie pose.

The train pressed on, and I sank deeper into my seat, trying to ignore the unsettled feeling creeping up my spine. We passed by the town again, exactly as I remembered it. In fact, now that I thought about it, I couldn’t even think of the sun having moved its position in the sky, as the shadows cast on the ground looked exactly the same.

Another hour passed, and another tunnel loomed ahead. This time, I closed my eyes, hoping the darkness would settle my nerves, but as we came out on the other side, my pulse quickened. There was the twisted tree again, and the same little town, everything eerily unchanged.

 

And then I saw it—a figure far off in the distance, silhouetted against the barren landscape. My eyes fixed on it, feeling a chill crawl up my spine. I couldn’t make out any details from here, but something about the figure felt… wrong, like it was watching me.

I stood up. “Excuse me?” I called out to the passenger across the isle from me, hoping for some reassurance. But he just stared at me with a blank smile, eyes unfocused, face unmoving.

I looked around, searching the other faces in the carriage, but they were all the same — strangers with serene, placid smiles that seemed almost painted on. My skin prickled with cold dread.

I tried opening both doors at each end of the carriage, but they were both locked. I made my way back to where I had been sitting and slumped back into my seat.

As the train rolled forward, I kept glancing out the window, my pulse quickening as we neared another tunnel. The figure outside had vanished from view, but not from my memory. I sat, staring out into the empty expanse of the Outback, wondering if I was losing my mind. But then we passed through another tunnel, and this time when we emerged, something was different.

The sun sat in the same spot, but it was, darker, somehow. The blue sky had a tinge of red to it, and the outback felt… different.

We approached the twisted tree and my heart sank. The tree was darker, not in color, but in, energy. I don’t know how to explain it, but I could feel it. Some branches had been broken, lying on the ground near its gnarled roots. The abandoned town had deteriorated also, paint peeling and some roofs sagging, appearing more decrepit than before. The figure was back too, still far off, but much closer than it had been. The shape of its body somehow… wrong. Too tall, limbs too long, as though it didn’t quite fit together, and it moved in an awkward, limping manner, lumbering towards the train.

I swallowed hard, pressing myself back into my seat. My phone. I reached for it, praying for reception. Nothing. Just empty bars, mocking me.

An hour later we entered another tunnel. Halfway through, still holding my phone in my hands, I saw a single bar of reception flicker to life. My heart pounded. Desperate, I tried to make a call, but just as a voice answered, the reception dropped as we exited the tunnel.

That’s when I started writing this. If I can make a call for help, then perhaps I can type it out and send it.

The landscape was decaying, everything I’d seen before deteriorating at an alarming rate. The tree was little more than a charred husk, and some buildings in the town were now nothing but a pile of rubble. The sky was definitely redder and darker than before, even though the sun had not moved. And the figure was much, much closer. It moved faster now, its featureless face seemed to be staring at me, long limbs clambering towards me. It radiated evil, a black aura surrounding it like a mist. I knew the next time I saw it, it would be right next to the train, and I don’t know what would happen then. I don’t know how I can tell, but I know that it’s me it wants. Its featureless face can’t hide its pure, malicious hatred for me.

I tried again to alert the other passengers, to snap them out of their spell. But as I moved down the aisle, the faces of the passengers turned to meet me, one by one, their eyes still empty, their expressions painted on. They watched me with those blank, serene smiles, the kind you’d give a child having a nightmare. I wanted to scream, to shake them, but fear choked me.

So now I wait for the tunnel. My finger will hover above the post button so as soon as I see a single bar of reception, I will try and post this as a call for help, and as a warning.

I pray I make it out of this, and make it back home. But I fear that this next tunnel will be my last. So goodbye. [Don’t forget me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OneMoreNightmare/)
