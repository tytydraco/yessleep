I look in the bathroom mirror and see her.  Her stomach is growing, her hair looking like it was shocked by a witch’s electricity.  I know she’s pregnant with me in her stomach, but I’m growing in such a way that you can see all my limbs forming through the thin lining of her belly.  I’m growing beyond what she can hold, pushing my way out.



There are images of her her holding me as an infant, as a small child, her hair everywhere, shocked by witch’s electricity… but right now I’m just fighting to break free through that thin lining of her stomach in the mirror, to split her open and be birthed into my own bloody self.



She’s lying in the bathtub.  Her wet hair is floating around her like a mermaid, except it’s black like mine.  No mermaid’s hair has ever been black.  And it’s not a soothing bath.  It’s dark red.  It’s so red you can’t actually see whether she’s human or mermaid. 



But you can see my arms ripping their way out of her stomach.  I’m the devil.  I’m the demon.  I’m the one who caused it all.  She had to be split open for me to be born.  You can see my arms tearing their way through her flesh into the open air, fighting for my own selfish life.



I wake up drenched in sweat.  My stomach is rumbling.  Is it hunger or an infant kicking?  I run to the bathroom to vomit from the heat of the sweat, but the rumbling stays inside me when nothing comes out.  I can see the movement inside me.  I can see it struggling to break free.  I see it clawing at me the way I clawed at her.  I see it in the mirror.



She had black hair and blue eyes, just like me.  My brother had red hair and green eyes, just like my father.  I used to believe that’s just how it works:  girls are born as their mothers, and boys are born as their fathers.  That’s just how it happened to work in our family.



People never believed my brother and I could be siblings until they saw our parents.  Then, the conspiracies started.  We must be clones.  Each one of us, a clone of each of our parents, respectively.  We were all so pale that we must be vampires.  We must be devil-worshippers.  We must not be real humans.  A girl for a mom and a boy for a dad.



I saw it in my mother.  I’m not sure whether it was her or the spirits that created us.  I saw her crying and clawing at walls and begging.  I saw her with her black hair looking like electricity.  Just the thought of the images makes whatever’s inside of me start moving again.  Electric, just like she was.  Ready to come out, to claw its way to its own selfish freedom as I did.



My brother, with the red hair, he had it worse than I did when people claimed he was the devil.  My father had the same red hair, but he ultimately realized the evil he had spawned.  He beat him down.  I can still hear the bloody sounds.  I hear it inside me.  The sounds of my brother screaming is coming from within my bloody womb.  “Please!”  That’s the one word.  Over and over.  Please what?  Please what?  Please, tell me what “please” means!



I can see this thing inside me moving when I look in the mirror.  I don’t see myself in the mirror.  I only see her.  I know that what comes out of me will be her.  When I look in the mirror, I see her dead in the bathtub, that black mermaid hair floating around her, and my tiny body clawing its way out.  Arms and fingernails, gripping at the bloody slit in her torso.  Selfish little being.



He killed him.  My father did.  He killed my brother because he knew that the evil had to be stopped.  He knew that we all spawn evil from one another.  He knew it all.  So he killed him.



It was somewhat poetic, seeing my brother’s red hair tinted further red.  Then my father’s as well.  End it all.  End it all.  It all repeats.  It all repeats.  Is my father evil for killing double evil?



They come back though.  They’re still here.  I can’t tell what’s present or future.  I can’t tell what’s now or what was or what will be.  It’s all now.  It’s all now.



“Schizoaffective” they said.  What’s that?  Not schizophrenia.  It's not schizophrenia.  It’s not.  



“Why did she do it?  Why?”  They wouldn’t answer.  Or maybe they couldn’t answer.  



“Schizoaffective”.  So it’s not schizophrenia.  The things she saw weren’t fake.  It all happened.  It did all happen.  It wasn’t fake.  None of it was fake.



I didn’t imagine it.  I didn’t image the clawing at my insides.  I didn’t imagine my brother’s bloody red hair.  She can’t have given it to me if she didn’t have it.



I fucking killed her by clawing my way out of her.  We all kill each other.  We all do.



And now, this thing is crawling its way out of me, and I don’t know if I can survive it.



I know it will look just like her, just like we all do.  I know it will be just as evil as we all are.



I swear to you, I saw it crawl out of my brother that night.  After my father did what he did to him, I saw it crawl out of his head onto the floor before I was grabbed away and forced not to watch where it went.



And I will die just as she did, with this thing to live a life of questioning its own self, until it realizes its ultimate evil purpose to let the next crawl out of it and continue in this world.



The mirrors don’t lie.  I cannot see myself.  No matter how hard I try, I don’t.  I only see her black mermaid hair in that bloody red bathtub, my brother, the evil that came out of him, the limbs forming their way to crawl out of me, and the way that I crawled out of her body in that bathtub.
