Alright, look. I don’t know where else to put this. Posting online feels... exposed, but I'm running out of options, and maybe, just maybe, someone here gets it. Or maybe I just need to get it out before I completely lose my grip.

My name is Leo. Eight months ago, a drunk driver T-boned my car. I woke up in a hospital bed to silence and darkness. Permanent damage to the optic nerves. Total blindness. My wife, Clara... she was in the passenger seat. She didn't make it.

They tell you recovery is a marathon. Learning to navigate the world again, relying on sound, touch, memory. I moved back into our apartment because familiarity was supposed to be my ally. My O&M instructor drilled it into me: know your space. Every floorboard creak, the hum of the fridge, the gurgle of pipes in the wall, the seventeen steps from bed to bathroom, the twelve from my armchair to the kitchen. These became my landmarks, my anchors in the dark.

For months, it was just... hard. Grief, frustration, learning curve from hell. But it was understandable hardship. Predictable, almost. The apartment was my safe zone, the one place I felt I had some control.

Then, about a month ago, that control started slipping. Not all at once, but in small, insidious ways that made me question my own senses, my own sanity.

It started with sounds being wrong. Not loud bangs or ghostly moans – that would almost be easier to label as crazy. No, it was subtle. I'd be walking down the familiar hardwood hallway, expecting the usual click-clack of my cane or my shoes, and suddenly, for a step or two, it would be thud-thud. Muffled, like walking on a thick rug. I’d stop, tap my foot. Click-clack. Normal. Reach down, feel the floor. Smooth, cool wood. No rug. Nothing. Take another step. Thud. Panic would fizz in my chest. I’d stand stock-still, straining my ears, trying to understand why the acoustic properties of my own hallway seemed to be changing mid-stride.

Then the fridge hum. That constant, low drone we all tune out? Mine started... cutting out. I’d be in the living room, maybe listening to an audiobook, and realize the kitchen was dead silent. Not just quiet, but an oppressive, eardrum-pressing silence. My heart would pound as I walked the twelve steps to the kitchen. The moment I stepped over the threshold, or sometimes the instant my hand touched the cold metal, the hum would fade back in, soft at first, then normal. Like it had been holding its breath, waiting.

Stress, right? Auditory hallucinations? Phantom sensations from a brain rewiring itself after trauma? I clung to those explanations. I wanted them to be true.

But then came the cold spots. My apartment's old, drafty. I know where the drafts are – under the front door, the leaky living room window seal. But these were different. A sudden chill brushing my cheek in the middle of the hallway, far from any known source. A pocket of icy air lingering by my armchair for a second, like someone had just walked past. I’d spin around – useless, I know, but instinct – listening intently. Nothing. Just the familiar apartment sounds, the distant city rumble. But the feeling of displaced air, of presence, lingered like a cold sweat.

The worst part, the part that truly unravels me, is the spatial distortion. This is hard to explain if you can see. My world is built on a mental map – sound echoes, textures, muscle memory. I know where things are. Or I did.

Lately, the map feels... unreliable. I’ll reach for the wall beside my bed, a wall I touch every single morning, and my hand travels further than it should. Just an inch, maybe two. But my stomach plummets. It feels like the wall receded. I tap it – solid plaster. But the distance felt wrong. Minutes later, I might walk towards the kitchen doorway, counting my steps, anticipating the frame, and bam – I walk into it a step early. Like the apartment itself is subtly shrinking and expanding around me, playing tricks with perspective that I have no way to visually confirm or deny.

The sounds escalated, too. Misplaced became the norm. Making tea, I heard the click-whoosh of the gas stove igniting, clear as day... but it sounded like it came from the bedroom closet. I froze, kettle heavy in my hand, turned my head towards the impossible sound. Silence. Turned back, hesitantly reached for the stove. Felt the heat radiating. It was on. The sound had just… originated from the wrong place. The shower running, sounding like it’s directly overhead in the living room ceiling. Each time, investigation reveals normalcy, the sound snapping back to its rightful origin as I approach. It's like auditory gaslighting.

You guys who can see, you hear a weird noise, you look. You scan, identify, rationalize. Cat knocked something over. Wind rattled the blinds. Whatever. You verify. I can't. I hear the impossible, feel the impossible, and I'm left standing in the dark, my remaining senses feeding me contradictory, terrifying information about the one place I’m supposed to know best. My own damn home.

I tried talking to my friend Sarah. She’s great, really supportive, but she defaults to the logical. Stress. Grief. PTSD. "Maybe talk to your doctor, Leo? Check your meds?" She means well. But how do you explain the feeling that the geometry of reality is fraying at the edges? That silence feels intentional?

Then came the breathing. Last week, lying in bed, trying to will myself to sleep in the too-quiet apartment. A sound started. Faint. Slow. Rhythmic. And close. Right beside my bed. Hhhh…. hhhh…. Not my breath; I was holding mine, listening, blood like ice water. Not the wind. It was deliberate. And it sounded… dry. Papery. Like old leaves crushed in a hand. I couldn't stand it. I lashed out blindly where the sound was. My hand sliced through empty, cold air. The breathing stopped. Instantly. Silence slammed back in. But the air my hand had passed through felt colder than the rest of the room.

It wasn't just by the bed after that. Cold spots on my neck while listening to headphones, feeling like icy breath. I’d rip the buds out, heart hammering. Silence. Just silence.

And the whispers. Faint, sibilant, seeming to come from inches away. Sometimes just formless sounds, other times… my name. “Leo…” Once, while Sarah was visiting, making tea in the kitchen, I heard it right beside my armchair. "Sarah?" I called out, voice tight. "No, honey, just putting the kettle on!" she called back cheerfully from the kitchen. The whisper vanished. Imagined? Or just… waiting?

Sarah, during that visit, gently brought up the anniversary of the accident. And Clara. "I know this time of year must be hard," she'd said, her hand briefly touching my arm. I flinched internally. "I'm managing," I lied, pushing it down. "This apartment stuff is just... weird."

But the seed was planted. Could this... could this all be grief? A psychotic break? My mind fracturing under the weight of trauma and loss, manifesting as sensory chaos? The thought terrified me almost more than a haunting. If it's not the apartment, it's me. My own brain, my most crucial tool now, betraying me.

I decided to try and capture something. Proof. I left my phone recording on my bedside table overnight. Listening back the next morning, navigating the audio file with VoiceOver reading out the timestamps, was mostly hours of ambient noise, my own restless movements. Then, around 3 AM, a patch of that deep, pressing silence. And within it, barely audible, the faint, papery breathing. Hhhh… hhhh… And just before it faded, a single, distinct click. Soft, sharp. Like a fingernail tapping the phone's microphone.

Something close enough to touch my phone while I slept.

The days leading up to the anniversary were the worst. The spatial shifts became nauseating. Reaching for a doorknob and finding empty air, taking a step and slamming into furniture that felt like it had lunged into my path. The whispers grew bolder, sometimes seeming to echo Clara's specific turns of phrase, things only she'd say. The breathing felt constant, a background hum of dry decay.

The anniversary itself arrived with a horrifying clarity. I woke up, not to chaos, but to a thick, waiting stillness. I sat in my armchair, the twelve steps to the kitchen feeling like miles, the seventeen steps to the bedroom an impossible journey. And I let myself think about Clara. Properly. The crash. The aftermath. The sounds.

I remembered her complaining about the sticky fridge handle, how you had to jiggle it just so. Suddenly, the ‘wrongness’ I’d felt wasn’t a spatial shift, but a phantom tactile memory of that specific sticky resistance.

I remembered her always being cold in that living room chair, wrapping herself in a specific worn blanket. The cold spots started feeling less like icy breath and more like... the lingering chill of her presence, an echo of her shiver.

The muffled footsteps near the closet where she kept her soft slippers.

And the breathing. That dry, papery sound. Oh god. The memory hit me, sharp and brutal – lying trapped in the wreckage, unable to see, hearing her beside me. Her breaths, shallow, ragged. Fading. Hhhh… hhhh… The sound wasn't a monster. It was the sound of my wife dying, imprinted on my auditory memory, now projected onto the silence of my apartment by a mind drowning in trauma.

The whisper of my name... the specific way she used to say it when she was worried.

It wasn't a ghost haunting my apartment. I was haunting my apartment. Haunted by grief so profound it was warping my perception, twisting sounds, textures, and spaces into manifestations of loss and trauma. My blindness wasn't just preventing me from seeing; it was forcing my brain to fill the void with the most painful data it had.

This realization didn't bring peace. It brought a different kind of horror. The horror of knowing my own mind could construct such convincing, terrifying illusions. That the entity in the dark was… me. Or the part of me shattered by loss.

I sat there, in the armchair, and finally broke. Wept until I was empty, the sounds of my own sobbing loud in the heavy silence.

It’s been a few days since then. Things are… quieter. But not fixed. The intense fear has subsided, replaced by a crushing weight of sadness. Sometimes, I still feel a cold spot, but now I associate it with her hand on my arm, and the grief is sharp. Sometimes a sound seems misplaced, but it feels less like a trick and more like an echo, a glitch in the playback of memory. The breathing... I haven't heard it again. Yet.

I re-listened to the recording. The breathing is still there, faint. And the click. Listening now, knowing... or thinking I know... what the breathing is, the click sounds different. Less like a fingernail, more metallic. Like... like something from the crash? A piece of shifting metal? Or is that just my traumatized mind layering more meaning onto meaningless noise?

I've contacted a grief counselor who deals with trauma. I’m trying to navigate this. But the apartment doesn't feel entirely safe yet. The knowledge that my reality can be so profoundly altered by my internal state is unsettling on a fundamental level. Is it just grief? Or has the trauma, the grief, somehow… thinned the walls? Made the space around me susceptible to reflecting my internal state in ways that aren't entirely natural?

I’m typing this now, VoiceOver reading my words back in its flat tone. The click of the keys sounds mostly right. Mostly. But sometimes, just for a second, the echo seems to come from the wrong place. From a little too far behind me.

I don't know if I've solved anything, or just identified the monster as residing within. And maybe that's the real horror. Knowing the darkness isn't just around you, but inside you, capable of reshaping the world you perceive. I'm still here. In the dark. Listening. And hoping the silence stays silent.
