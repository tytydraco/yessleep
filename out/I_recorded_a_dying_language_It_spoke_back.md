I came here to document a dying language. That was the plan. Audio archives, digital transcriptions, maybe a published paper if I was lucky. The usual postdoc pipeline.


But the language wasn’t dying; it was hiding.


They call it the "chant-without-tongue." Spoken by fewer than eight people, all above seventy, all clustered in the warped fishing villages along the northern coast of the Karajóm Peninsula. 


Every elder I met said the same thing:


*"Some words were not meant to be remembered."*


I assumed they meant it metaphorically. Trauma, colonialism, generational silence. But the more I listened, the more I realized something was wrong. Not culturally. Not socially. Physically.


It started with a man named Okur. He sat barefoot on the rocks near the sea, skin cracked like driftwood, voice barely a thread. I asked him to describe a sunrise in the chant-without-tongue.


He didn't answer right away. He just breathed in through his nose, then whispered a word I didn’t recognize. I marked the timestamp, wrote a quick gloss, and moved on. That night, I played the file back. 


At first, it sounded like nothing. A bit of wind. A soft exhale. But the waveform did something I’d never seen: it folded. Not clipped. Not flattened. Folded. As if it were hiding a second layer beneath the first.


Then the audio extended.
Not looped, but extended. New seconds began to appear at the end of the file, filling in with low, symmetrical pulses that looked almost artificial. I checked the recorder. No bugs. No autogeneration. No WiFi.


I listened again.
And it spoke back.
The new audio wasn’t Okur’s voice. It was deeper. Rhythmic. Less like speech and more like resonance filtered through lungs made of stone. Each word layered with harmonics that didn’t match the environment.


I slowed it down. Reversed it. Spectrogrammed it. The patterns didn’t break, no matter how I altered the audio.


I took it back to Okur the next day. He listened. Didn't blink.


"I didn’t say that," he said.


"You did. It's recorded."


He shook his head. "It did. Through me."
Behind us, the sea had gone quiet. The gulls were gone.


I left my gear running overnight, hoping to catch whatever anomaly caused the echo. At 3:17 a.m., the recorder turned itself on. No power spike. No timer. It began recording silence.


 Then, eleven minutes in, it captured the same voice.
New words. New phrases. Ones I hadn’t heard in any prior interviews. Ones I couldn’t find in any linguistic database.


I sent the audio to a colleague at Uppsala who specializes in acoustic archeology. He replied in three words:


*"Turn it off."*


That night I didn’t sleep. My window faced the sea, and the sound of the waves had become syncopated.

Breathing. I could feel the pulse of the ocean in my spine.


The next day, I found Okur's house empty. Door wide open. No signs of struggle. No packed bags.


Just my recorder on his bed, still running. Battery at 98%.
I didn’t remember leaving it there.


The audio now auto-generates. I unplugged the mic and it keeps recording. I deleted the files and they return. Not copies. New instances. Slightly altered. As if the voice is refining itself. Learning. Remembering.


And yesterday, it said my name.
Not in passing. As a sentence.


"Mira is listening now."


I checked the waveform. It wasn’t just speech. It was shaped like a fingerprint. My fingerprint. I scanned my thumb and overlaid the spectrogram.


Perfect match.
I don’t know what I’ve found. I don’t think it was meant to be found. 


The locals weren’t avoiding documentation because they were shy or oppressed. They were protecting something. Or maybe protecting us from something.


This isn’t just a chant. It’s a medium. An interface.
And now, It has a voice.


If this is a god, it is not holy. It is not warm. It is not merciful.


It is memory without anchor. Language without mouth. Sound without source.
I can feel it in my bones when I don’t play the file. Like it’s disappointed.


So I destroyed the recorder.
Then the laptop.
Then every backup drive I had, even the encrypted ones.
I even paid a kid at an internet café to nuke the cloud. Told him it was a breakup. He laughed and took my cash.


But the voice didn’t stop.
Now it’s everywhere. In ventilation hums, in dripping faucets, in the rhythm of birds on the roof. I close my eyes and it speaks through thought. Not like an idea, but like a parasite trying to convince me it was always mine.


It doesn’t call my name anymore. It questions it.
It asks why I thought I had one.


It tells me my voice was never mine to begin with.
It repeats sentences I haven’t spoken.


It finishes thoughts I didn’t mean to have.
It tells me memories out of order and dares me to sort them. I can’t.


Last night, it whispered a sequence of numbers. When I googled them, I found my doctoral thesis cached, translated into a language I never studied.


I don’t think it’s haunting me.
I think it got in. Through the ears. Through the waveform. Through the part of the mind that turns noise into meaning.


I’m writing this now because I still remember which thoughts are mine.
Most of the time.
Long enough, maybe, for someone else to see what it looks like before it wears me completely.


Some words are best left unheard.
