Hello everyone. I have some updates on my account. I believe most of you are aware of my last situation (you can read on [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/199rfts/found_a_recording_of_my_parents_discussing_a/)) : waiting for the police and locked in a room, being chased by a serial killer. Every step echoed like an irregular heartbeat, while his presence approached. The distorted melody of that children's song continued to haunt my thoughts, echoing through the flooded corridors of my childhood home.  
  
I didn't have many options. I futilely checked the window, only to see my car submerged in the lake. The killer seemed to know my movements before I even made them. I was forced to seek refuge upstairs, barricading myself in the attic, trying to drown out the sound of my own frantic breath.  
  
Minutes turned into hours, and every faint sound in the empty house made me shudder. I could hear the slow steps of the killer outside, as if he were playing with me, savoring the fear he himself had created. Suddenly, everything fell silent. It was as if time had stopped. I realized it was my chance to escape. Carefully, I opened the door and descended the stairs. My eyes scanned the surroundings, and a dark shadow stood out against the glow of the flooded lake.  
  
There he was, the killer, wearing that horrendous mask that had been the catalyst for all my fears, bringing a flood of memories to mind. Without thinking, my survival instinct took over. I ran in the opposite direction, but he already knew I was there. I ran in twists and turns until I reached the exit, but my house resembled more of a maze, and my desperate run made me come face to face with him. I stopped for a moment as I contemplated his face, hidden behind the terrifying smile, dark hollows staring at me. He raised his knife and tried to strike me.  
  
With no choice, I had to engage in confrontation. Every movement was a macabre dance, between dodging and attacking. My heavy breathing mixed with the sound of the rain still falling outside. I was losing strength, but something in me refused to give up. With a reckless impulse, the remnants of energy in my muscles, I tried to grab his face, to pull some point, but what I managed to do was to take off his mask. He wore a balaclava underneath, but I could see in his green eyes the panic, the fear. The tables had turned. He let out an inhuman scream and raised his hands to his face, as if injured. It was enough to give me an opening, and I escaped through the back door, diving into the darkness of the forest surrounding the house.  
  
I ran desperately through the night, the sound of broken branches and trampled leaves mixing with the sound of my accelerated breath. Until finally, I saw the red-blue lights of sirens. I ran to them waving frantically, recounting the situation. The officers in question were not the ones responding to my call, but they took me to the police station to file the report.  
  
The on-duty officer, a middle-aged man with tired eyes, initially seemed skeptical when I told the story. Who wouldn't be? Clown-masked killers and stories of twins being targeted by a serial killer seemed more like the plot of a horror movie than reality.  
  
"Look, sir, maybe you got confused? Saw things."  
  
"No, I know who he was, that guy was definitely the Biddenden Reaper."  
  
"Mr. Peter, right? That name doesn't exist. We don't have a case like that registered..."  
  
"No... it can't be, he, he even left this." I showed the mask. "I have a voice recording too if you want, at my parents' house..."  
  
The man looked at me and lowered his voice.  
  
"Peter... Follow me."  
  
Speaking like that, I could recognize his voice...  
  
We walked to a private room, white lights reflecting on the yellowed surface of the walls, while the low hum of electricity sounded. The officer sat in an iron chair that I could swear trembled under his weight. He gestured to another chair, placed on the opposite side of a narrow aluminum table fixed to the floor. I sat down, and his eyes hovered over me.  
  
"Peter... you grew up, huh? I would say it's good to see you, but... I wouldn't like it to be under these circumstances."  
  
"I wish I could say the same, but I don't remember you, you know, some important facts of my life were hidden from me."  
  
"I understand your resentment, kid, but we didn't do this for your harm, understand. Your parents just wanted to protect you, and I gave them the answer."  
  
"Looks like it didn't work very well."  
  
He sighed heavily before continuing, seemingly weighing his words.  
  
"I think I owe you some answers too. My name is David Turner. I am the Officer of this precinct, and at the time when everything happened, I was a rookie detective. As the murders occurred, there was great commotion in the media, the killer remained at large while the crimes happened, and it fell on me, I was demoted and gradually settled here in this small town."  
  
He pulled out a folder, a brown envelope, from under the table. Handed it to me, signaling to open it. There were some papers. I took out the first one, revealing a [police sketch](https://ibb.co/pX3hFQg) . An adult man, maybe 35 years old, with 3 markings: 

1 - List of possible names (which I obviously won't publish) 

2- Scar on the forehead 

3- Scar on the cheek.  
  
"This is the police sketch that one of the victims' relatives provided, compared with the other reports, it is the one that most resembles his face."  
  
The eyes of the drawing stared at me coldly as David continued:  
  
"But there's a serious problem..." He seemed reflective, making a pause.  
  
"What would it be?"  
  
"The Reaper has already been caught, his name was Joshua P. Francis."  
  
"Was?"  
  
"Yes, 'was', take the second paper."  
  
He pointed to the envelope.  
  
I took out a medical record, at the header, in bold letters, the statement said "AUTOPSY RESULTS."  
  
"He died at the beginning of last year, before being directed to death row. He died in his sleep in his cell. We kept this under wraps until now, so as not to cause a commotion."  
  
The news hit me like a punch. I was afraid of being the next victim, of closing the circle, but now, I feared the answer to the new questions in my mind.  
  
"It can't be..." I mumbled, unable to believe what I was hearing.  
  
David seemed to understand my reaction.  
  
"I know this is hard to accept, Peter. But the records are clear. He was arrested, the murders stopped, and a year and a half later, he died."  
  
"What happened after his death? I mean, if he really was dead, then who was in my house?" I asked, my voice trembling.  
  
David leaned back in his chair, looking at the police sketch.  
  
"I don't have all the answers, Peter. I'm trying to understand this myself. Maybe what we are facing now is something different. An admirer of his? Maybe..."  
  
He took an old recorder from his drawer and placed it on the table.  
  
"You said you heard a recording, right? I have the complete one here, I think it would be right to show it to you."  
  
He took out a tape from his coat and played it, it was another version of what I had heard at home, perhaps a "prequel," before the account I picked up:  
  
\[Note: The transcript of the tape includes some unintelligible parts, and some passages may be difficult to understand due to the recording's quality.\]  
  
Sound of clicks and hisses as the tape is rewound. Detective D's voice echoes in the room.  
  
D: Well, Mr. and Mrs. Carlson, I'm back to discuss some more details about what happened. I have some preliminary results, but before that, I'd like to go over the events again.  
  
M: Yes, of course, we want to help in any way we can.  
  
J: We're very concerned about what happened to our Francis.  
  
D: Understandable. Could you please tell me again what happened that day?  
  
M: Well, as we mentioned before, we had a family breakfast, and then we went fishing at the lake. We were all together.  
  
A sound of a door opening, Peter enters the room.  
  
Peter: (child's voice) Mom, I drew something at school! Want to see?  
  
J: Sure, dear. Later, we were talking to the detective about what happened last Friday. Let's talk about that later, okay?  
  
Peter: (child's voice, whining) I wish Francis was here to see.  
  
Peter leaves the room again, and the door closes.  
  
M: Sorry for the interruption.  
  
D: No problem. Please continue.  
  
M: Well, after fishing for a while, we decided to go back home. That's when Peter wanted to take Francis to show him the swing he had made in the nearby forest.  
  
D: And was it at that moment that something happened?  
  
J: Yes, when they came back, Peter was alone and looked scared. He said Francis wanted to play hide and seek with a man wearing a clown mask. We didn't understand what happened.  
  
A thunder roars outside, interrupting the conversation for a moment.  
  
D: And did you immediately look for Francis?  
  
M: Yes, we ran to the forest, but we found no sign of him. The only thing we found was the mask.  
  
D: (serious voice) The mask is important. If possible, could you show it to me?  
  
The sound of a door opening and closing again.  
  
J: (muffled voice) Here it is. Peter said he found it near the swing.  
  
Sound of steps approaching.  
  
Peter: (child's voice) I didn't like this game. The man made Francis disappear.  
  
Peter leaves the room again, and the door closes.  
  
D: (compassionate voice, clearly emotional) I'm very sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Carlson. This must be devastating.  
  
M: We don't know how to explain to Peter what happened to his brother.  
  
D: I understand. We'll continue investigating, and we'll do our best to find out who is responsible for this. Let's keep all this under wraps for now, as we discussed before.  
  
J: Yes, of course.  
  
\[The sound of a door being closed forcefully can be heard.\]  
  
D: What's happening?  
  
\[The sound of the tape is interrupted.\]  
  
The sound of the tape ends.  
  
Listening to the recording, my mind was cloudy. Memories of my childhood mixed with the reality of the current moment. The sound of my own child's voice crying for the absence of my brother echoed in the room.  
  
"That day, kid, when we had to stop the recording, it was because you ran out of the house, determined to find Francis. We didn't tell you about the body..."  
  
Warm tears streamed down my cheeks.  
  
"And why now?"  
  
"We don't even know... About two months ago, the station was invaded. Camera system hacked, alarms deactivated, all professional."  
  
He lit a cigarette.  
  
"But instead of stealing weapons, drugs, uniforms, or cars... only one thing disappeared, and you can probably guess what it is."  
  
I looked at the mask on the table.  
  
"I won't blame you if you want to give up, but I think your experience can be useful to help us with the case. What do you say?"  
  
I accepted Officer David Turner's proposal. I knew that, somehow, my connection to the past could be crucial to solving this mystery. He gave me an improvised badge with my name and the word "consultant" written on it. It wasn't the perfect solution, but it was enough to make me feel that, somehow, I was in control of the situation.  
  
After the meeting, I was dismissed from the police station. Instead of going to my parents' house, I opted for a motel in the city. I needed some time alone to process everything that had happened. Arriving at the small room, I took a long shower, trying to wash away the sensation of fear and desperation that still lingered on my skin.  
  
As I dried myself and prepared to sleep, exhaustion finally began to hit me. But just as I closed my eyes, a subtle sound caught my attention. A soft slip under the door of the room. Approaching, I saw a small folded paper. Instinctively, I picked it up and unfolded it.  
  
"Give me back my face."  
  
A cold shiver ran down my spine. What on earth could that mean? I looked through the peephole. No one. I risked opening the door and peeking into the hallway, no sign of any living thing. I even called the front desk, asking if anyone had passed by. All negative answers. While the faint moonlight entered through the window, I decided to close the curtains to feel safer. However, that's when panic set in.  
  
My room overlooked the back of the motel. Even in the dark, I could see the well-outlined silhouette of a dumpster, the road in the background with some occasional trucks and cars, and... a person, someone looking at my window. My eyes adjusted to the darkness, and a chill ran through my body when I realized that this figure wore... my father's face. The eyes stared at me with an empty expression, the skin tone aged, as if it had been seasoned, frozen in a cruel smile. I quickly moved away from the window, my heart racing.  
  
The man, upon realizing my reaction, slowly raised his hand and waved calmly. I called David, I already informed the front desk about the intruder, and security is preparing to investigate. I know he won't do anything, not now, they're playing with me, and I won't let them win...
