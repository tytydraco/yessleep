  

I got up with a phone call from my boss, Mr. Ragdall, head of Binocular Bugle, charming as always. 

The man yelled at me to rush to the city hall because she was about to be trialed for the murder of those two kids. 

I was half asleep and never mind that it was my day off, but I didn't want to prolong the yelling so I told him I would be in as soon as I could. 

 I didn't even manage to shower, I knew I had no time whatsoever to get to the court, so I grabbed the camera and what I thought was an apple, apparently, it was a persimmon which was weird because I didn't buy any of them but at that point, it didn't matter. 

I got there barely in time, my mom got pissed the first time I showed up with a bike when I was younger. She used to say that it was dangerous riding a bike because it was easier to get robbed, what she doesn't realize now is that this city isn't the same as before, I don't know what's been happening this past few years, but as a city begins to grow, everything else goes along with it, including crimes… I usually tend to stay away from places I’m not supposed to be and even then it’s always good to have a friend in every area and be polite, it never hurts. 

 Rana was already coming out to the Main Hall; the place was jammed packed. Every single paparazzi, journalist, and channel van was already there trying to get a chance with her, and from what I got, she was declared not guilty of the twin's disappearance, which made some people there pissed. 

The Twins' family stayed outside, and a short fat guy suddenly got aggressive and tried to throw something at her, I assumed he was the father. The police had to subdue him while she was escorted out to her car. I manage to take a picture of the car plate so I could follow her. 

Working as a journalist, I always figured that the kind approach to be better, I needed something juicy, and acting all ghoul-like the other channels and brands wouldn't work. 

Ragdall was ready to break my neck as soon as he saw me the next day, yelling about my laziness and all that jazz. I asked him if we could speak privately, and he stopped for a second, I was smiling, I felt like I was going to bring the greatest story of the year. 

I told him to give me three months and I would give him the Golden Paper and while he was starting to get red again when he then paused, I wasn’t joking, and he realized that. 

He stared at me for a solid second, told me to not get in over my head and then to leave his office, all of that with a calming voice. The rest of the staff got baffled because they'd never seen him calm. I left confused, the man had like, five thousand years of experience in the field so that was kind of ominous.

The following morning, a friend managed to track down her escort car, I was in town already which made it easy to get to her. She was leaving the cafe when I got up to her and asked if I could take a picture, her response was one of her bodyguards ramming me to the floor and breaking my camera and at that point, I feared for my life because the guy looked like one of those bodybuilders that lift cars with ease. 

 Rana told him to stop and apologized for his behavior, I sat up and she said explained that for the past few days, she's been harassed by almost everybody in town, saying that everybody accused her of wanting her 15 minutes of fame for killing the twins. I felt like a dick, she seemed genuinely afraid and depressed. 

She offered to pay for the camera, but I declined and jokingly asked her bodyguard if I could take her for a cup of coffee, she raised her hand playfully showing the coffee cup but gave me her number and invited me for dinner at one of the most famous restaurants in town. 

I asked her how she could eat out with all the heat she was taking, and she said that some people don't judge others so harshly. I got a major crush on her for some reason, she didn't seem to be the monster that the media, me included, made her out to be, which made me have second thoughts about how journalists sometimes are a bit fucked. 

I got home, I still had a few hours before dinner time, so I went to take the shower I was meant to take two days ago. I went to my closet, and I realized I had no fancy clothing, not even a shirt. I didn't need fancy clothing because my life, in general, wasn't for that, I've lived in a studio apartment for about four years and never felt the need for a fancy life, more so because sometimes I spent like, two weeks straight working so I was away from home during those times, and I learned to have a practical life, or I was all excuses, at least that was what my mom said when I called her asking to come with me shopping for something I could wear. 

 I met my mom near City Hall, she came with my older brother because she insists that the city is too violent nowadays, so he came along. Since he was already here and we didn't see each other for a while, I decided to take them for a snack. 

We live in a medium-sized urban city, it grew in the past few years because of tourism and a sort of infamous story that said the city was cursed, there was a massive case where thirty-something kids went missing, a man was accused of kidnapping a majority of the kids and got sentenced to death. I was in that case as well at the time, still a rookie though, I needed something to boost me up so I could get the staff job, but that's old news now. 

 I left my mom and brother still at the mall, got changed in the fitting rooms of the store where I bought the clothes, and made my way to the restaurant. Unironically, I know this city better than I know myself, I followed the GPS and it led to a place called “Raw Dawg”, it was a small, white building a couple of blocks away from the Bugle, I had never seen this place in my entire life, but I guess sometimes I don’t pay attention to stuff I don't care about. 

I got in and was immediately met by a slender, absurdly tall pale waiter, he was almost bald with a trail of white hair at the top of his head, combed from the left side, he looked way too old to be alive, to be honest, looked like a corpse but with teeth were impeccable, he also had a shit-eating grin for some reason. He was extremely welcoming and asked to take away my coat if I was waiting for somebody or if I had any reservations when Rana showed up before I could answer, she was already in the restaurant, in the bar section. 

The waiter took us to our table and said he would be back in a minute with the specials, I had a wire because although she seemed nice, I still had the Golden Paper in mind, and it wasn't like she was going to confess a full-on murder, right?! It was on me just in case. 

While we waited, I apologized again for the cafe incident and told her that being a journalist sometimes makes you forget that we're all humans. She paused, looked at me, and asked me what made me go after, and what was my goal that day. I said I was just for the job, that I wasn't looking at her as a person, more so as a way of making money. 

She asked me how I would react if it was the other way around… 

I didn't have an answer, it made me think how this job had dehumanized me, most of the city was trying to blame her without any proof, the police itself wasn't able to find anything, and she had complied to everything that they asked, not once raising suspicion and even with all that, everybody wanted her to be arrested anyway because they didn't buy the story. 

So, I told her that if it happened to me, I would probably have a bad reaction, and I thanked her for giving me a second chance at being a human, she smiled and accepted the apologies. 

The rest of the dinner was us getting to know each other, to the point I even forgot I had the wire. Rana was probably one of the most intelligent and interesting people I had met in recent years. She was young, a twenty-one-year-old with a major in Medicine, she was aiming to become a surgeon but for the time being she was still babysitting, which, due to the whole twin thing, she regretted. Her eyes showed so much hope and joy in the way she talked, about traveling, and helping people, apparently, babysitting was training for when she becomes a mother. Rana seemed to adore children, so I assumed that the situation kind of threw her off, but I quickly reassured her that that wasn't going to last long and that worked because she smiled at me, like a baby girl when you buy something that's she's been asking for a while. 

I think the wine was making her a little bit looser, which made her more friendly than before, and she was nice, to begin with. 

I kept looking at her all night while she talked, she was beautiful, her skin was pale, like cold milk, but it fitted nicely with pitch black, shoulder-length straight hair, her face looked like it was sculpted, her lips were big and a mix of pink and red. Her cheeks, round and perky, were met by her small nose that had a small piercing, just a small shiny dot on top of her left nostril. Her eyes were big and different colored, one was purple and the other was light brown, her eyelashes were big and curvy, and she looked Asian, but her snow skin threw me off, I'd never seen a pale white Asian but that didn't matter. She had no make-up whatsoever. 

She got a bit tipsy at the end, and so did I honestly, she's rather short, and she was wearing this black dress that showed her body, my god, I looked like some kind of joke looking at her, her bosoms were medium-sized and round, she wasn't wearing a bra, her belly was non-existing, which baffled me because ate more than me, and that's a feat, her waist was tinny but then it all opened up when I looked at her butt, it looked like two bubbles that didn't seem to burst no matter how she walked. She was cold to the touch but smelled so good, I couldn't figure out what I was but remembered something sweet. 

So I called a cab for her, I thought she was going to kiss me before going home but instead, she gently, placed her hands on my cheeks and her lips met my forehead, the smell of her bosoms almost made me go crazy of how good it was, then she looked straight into my eyes and thanked me for showing her good people still existed and that she wanted to see me again. 

She got in and the cab went off. I could honestly say that she was something special. 

I got home around 04:25 a.m., and for the first time in 4 years I felt lonely, her words echoed in my head, the things she said about becoming a mother, having an extra room for the toys, a big bed for the whole family, a big TV for movie time, traveling just for fun, I sat in my chair and saw my life as it truly was… a small space with no extra room for anybody. I closed my eyes for a couple of seconds, forgot that alcohol was my worst enemy, I jumped from my chair with a text, and it was already 13: 00p.m, my neck was swollen because of the chair so I got up slowly and reached for my phone.

It was a text from Ragdall asking “What the fuck happen” last night, I forgot that I told him I would text him if something went down, so I called him. The sounded preoccupied…that was a first, I told him that I would stay home to go through the tape and see if there was something good. 

He didn't yell or anything, just to stay safe and to shower more. 

I booted up my laptop and plugged in the tape and started to listen through it. 

At first, I thought to myself how much of an idiot I was when I was drunk, it was cringy to hear myself talk about kids, traveling and all that nonsense, but it dawned upon me, I was being sincere... This girl made say out laugh something I didn't know I wanted, it wasn't even the drinking, I felt like myself for the first time since I can remember. 

I edited the whole convo, there wasn't anything suspicious, but I had to give Ragdall something. I ended up going to him, I quickly paced the whole office until his cubicle, and while he turned his chair around to face me, I threw the tape onto his lap while closing the door quickly and silently. We started listening to the tape, he was serious, paying attention, and reversing when necessary. After he finished, he told me something was off, that she seemed too perfect, and asked me if there was anything weird about that encounter itself, anything at all. 

I couldn't remember anything that stood out to the point of raising red flags but I mentioned that I'd never seen the "Raw Dawg" restaurant before, he said that there were a few around the city, the one that he assumed that I went to was newly opened and that it was expensive, weird but in a fancy way experience, and then hoped that I showered first before meeting her, we laughed. He told me to keep my distance and not to get too deep because you never know, "pretty girls are bat shit insane kid" he said.

I made my way out of the building, it was about 16:23, since I had a few days off, and it was going to be sunny the next days, I decided to go home and binge-watch an anime or a TV Show when I got a text from Rana.  "I'm sorry if I offended you last night, I had a great time and I would like to see you again" she texted. I was surprised by the text, either she was weak to alcohol or banged her head against something. I decided to call her, and she answered with a shivering voice, so I asked her what happen. 

She again apologized if she offended me, but I stopped her mid-sentence and told her to “Relax 

Rana last night was the most fun I’ve had in a long while”, she was relieved and thanked me I asked her why she thought that something bad happened and it was because I didn't say anything the whole day, I laughed it off and said that I woke up super late and had to run to work but I was free at the time. 

Rana seemed more relaxed, I asked her if she was busy later that day and she said some guys were going to her house to re-paint her living room, so she needed to stay home. I asked about her house and holy fuck it seemed like a maze. 

I was going home on foot that day, driving a godamn motorcycle with a hangover had always been a big no-no for me, so I decided to Facetime her so she could show me the house. 

She picked up the phone, his face was red and his hair was wet. She apparently was back from jogging, and I jokingly asked if that’s how she stayed in such good shape, “So you’ve noticed” she replied with a sassy look.  

She went inside and I could see this long-ass hallway and a door right after she went inside, it was a bathroom, for guests from what she told me, but it was big, filled with light blue and white colors all around it, she walked a bit more and she there were two doors in front of each other, the left one was the bedroom and the right one was another bedroom. I asked if I could see her bedroom and she said maybe in-person "Wink, wink" and I got excited but had to play it cool, but she did tell me that she had a small bathroom there, sounded fancy. 

I almost dropped my phone when she reached the end of the hallway and went inside the living, that shit was MASSIVE, she started laughing and said that it wasn't even that big, right up front I could see the backyard… just imagine having a fucking backyard, that alone to me was weird. She turned left and went inside the kitchen, American style, with an island-like counter, dark sea blue, and grey colors. 

There was a door next to the pantry that connected the kitchen to the garage, Rana got back outside saying that the smell of the paint was too unnatural and strong. I asked her why she was repainting the walls, and her dad offered to pay for the painting, saying that "a house must reflect its "owner", I asked what he meant by that, and Rana said, "He's old so who knows".

We laughed and spoke until I got back to my studio, she then asked me if I ever thought about getting a bigger place to which I replied with a no, my life was always unstable and that I never spent any time home anyways, Rana smiled and said "Maybe that might change" and before I could ask her what she meant, her dad showed up and she said she had to go. 

I dropped the phone on top of the bedside table and laid down on my bed, looking around my studio apartment and feeling constricted for the first time in my life, Rana was six years younger than me and had her entire life put together, which made me realize even more how much of a dick I was, how fucked people in this town were, they were jealous, this girl had ambitions, and took her life advantage to make something for herself and people saw that as her being a spoiled person, a good way to destroy her family name. 

I reflected for a while, why was I still here, living this life, not having a stable relationship with anybody, not having a proper place that I could call a house… I mean, it's not like I had financial problems. My thoughts were interrupted by a call from Ragdall, yelling at me again to "meet him in the Grand Anthro Hospital yesterday, big scoop going down". I drove there, and there was way too much traffic for that time of the day, these situations make me think how glad I was to have a bike. 

I got there and Ragdall grabbed me, and we got through all the commotion and stayed in a corner waiting, I asked him what we were waiting for and right after I saw a person being taken by the cops, bloody mouth and clothes, screaming and jerking his body violently, I had enough time to take enough pictures and make full video discreetly. The police escorted everybody out and were confiscating phones because people were recording the whole thing, so I got away from Ragdall and told him to leave and meet me back in the Bugle. 

Once there, our team reunited in a closed room, this case was fucked, two of my coworkers, Brian and Susan were on this guy for months. This dude killed a pregnant woman. The photos that I had taken would probably help with the cover and that was it, Susan had some more stuff. 

John Louis was his name, a fifty-five-year-old plumber, and single father, had a relatively normal life besides his divorce, but even that looked normal, Brian said that he and his ex-wife were or at least appeared to be friendly, and the kid had a relatively normal life.

I asked them to back up all the way, why were they following this man, it didn't make any sense for them to know about his life this extensively without some type of tip-off from the cops or something. 

Susan said that he had a rage episode 7 months ago and asked her brother to keep an eye on him, turns out her brother's a cop, not a cop, but like a detective, she said she had a hunch. 

Briand got involved 3 months after Susan asked him to follow him and his kid to one of the RD restaurants, it was weird yeah, the restaurant was fancy and expensive. 

The one that I went to was the newest one to open, it was a mixture of Japanese and Italian restaurants, with a lot of blacks and reds around the walls and floor, with yellow dim lights hanging around the whole place, round tables with a roast yellow shiny color on them, black puffy chairs and no TV, to avoid distractions, it gave the vibe that you had to focus either on the food or on the person you were with, which was fine by me.

The bar area reminded me of the dark, somber bars that my dad used to get himself "happy" as he would tell me, but not a place to take a child. Brian said he went inside and tried to follow them but was stopped by the front waiter, he then said that it was odd that a restaurant was that exclusive, he even said that he tried to book a table just so he could get inside because he saw that John went inside a room in the back of the restaurant with his kid, but the waiter threw him out. I asked what he meant by throwing out, how could a waiter do that?! 

Brian said that the waiter grabbed him by the neck, raising him using one hand, and politely asked him to "Leave the premises, sir, you have no tables for today and causing a disturbance for the rest of the customers", he then walked out still grabbing him and dropped him on his feet, smiled and went back inside, "a shit-eating grin" he said. 

I panicked a little bit; I asked him what the waiter at the door looked like. Susan then chimed in and said that he was tall and skinny, and old, old enough to be her great-grandfather. So, these restaurants were hiring old people, maybe veterans, as a way to help them cope with their time in service or something like that, maybe a marketing strategy, since these restaurants were just popping up out of nowhere and seemed exclusive, not everybody to just go inside and eat. 

Susan’s brother, Jack, then called, we got quiet, he couldn’t know that we were listening since it was probably classified information. 

The conversation was messed up: 

Jack: “Susie...this is fucked, this guy is insane…” 

Susan: “What happened, what did he do? How's the kid?” 

Jack: “Huh… The kid is fine…physically I mean, he was there when his dad killed the woman.” Susan: “Jackman, buddy, I need you to focus, I know something fucked up must've happened, but I need you to tell me everything you know.” 

Jack: “...This is…John ate her man, Susie, he ate the woman, there are bite marks all over her belly, he made his way into the fetus…The fetus is somehow still alive, I can’t find where they took it but a cop confirmed that it’s alive, his kid saw the whole thing. ” 

Susan: "…Send me everything you have…photos, video files, whatever, send it all and drop this case, I'm sorry I dragged you into this." 

Jack: “You’re damn right you are, find another job man.” 

She hung up and we waited in silence, everybody was tense, Brian was shaking and trying to hide it, Ragdall got up and lit a cigar and stood by the window, Susan placed her hands on her temples, trying to massager herself while staring at the computer. I was just sitting there, shocked, to be honest, this man had killed a woman with nothing but his teeth while his kid watched… We're journalists, we were supposed to be numb when shit like this happens, we report this on a monthly, some even daily… 

Why was my boss, a veteran in this area, holding in his disgust for this man, why was Susan, a woman who was in a war zone, mentally defeated, by a small crime, compared to the stuff that she'd seen before, why was Brian, a man that had interview 4 serial killers face to face, shaking because of a murder committed by an unstable man… Why was I feeling disgusted and angry?

I felt sorry for the kid, the woman, the baby, if this was my life for the past 6 years and I had never felt anything towards the people that I reported about, why now!? 

The silence was stopped by a notification sound, Susan’s brother had sent all the data that he had about the case. 

She sat there, still with her hands in her temples, not moving, not knowing if she should open the email. He got startled when my phone rang all of a sudden, Rana was calling me, I picked up asking how she was, and she asked me the same thing, saying that she saw on TV what happened and asked me if I was in the hospital. I didn't understand, I asked what she meant by that, and she then said that John had escaped, he ripped his hand off the cuffs from what the news was saying, everybody in the room looked at me with a nervous look. I rushed out with Brian following me, we hopped on my bike and made our way to the hospital. 

We were too late, the place was jammed packed with police, other channels, and a crowd big enough to not let anyone through. 

I called Rana back, apologizing for hanging up so suddenly, and asked her about any details, she told me to meet her at the coffee shop, it wasn't too far, so I gave Brian my keys and go back once he was finished, I would be getting the bike tomorrow. 

I walked to the coffee shop, and it took me a while, I didn't realize how tired I was, I called my mom to check up on her, and she yelled at me for being near dangerous places, I guessed she already knew about the whole hospital drama, so I told her I had some days off, I was working on another case, which made her happy. Rana was already there, sitting down with two coffee mugs, she was wearing a blue blazer, under it, she had a tight black dress and "Havaianas”, black as well, her toenails were painted red, same as the nails, her hair was in a bun, beautiful as ever. 

I just smiled at her as I sat down, and sternly said I needed to rest, she wasn't happy that I wasn't sleeping enough, and I told her I would as soon as this case ended. She wasn't happy with my answer to which I apologized and attempted to grab her hand, she moved her hand and grabbed the mug to take a seat, and told me to take a sip, it was a new coffee that they had come up with. 

I wasn't a fan of coffee but this one was nice, it had a mixture of milk, the black beans of the coffee still in the mug, and caramel, all blended inside, it was nice. 

I then said I would take some days off, I promised, she looked at me and asked if I wanted to stay at her place…I couldn't even answer, she blushed and angrily said that it was for her to be sure that I had my rest…I laughed and say that I would get some stuff back at my apartment and would meet her there. 

She left pretending to be mad at me, kissed me on my forehead, and told me to hurry. 

It was the first time in a long time that a woman cared this much for me before, and it felt good. I forgot that Brian had my bike keys, I called him to know where he was, I was home already, it had been four hours since I left the hospital, it was nighttime, I was losing track of time for a while now, maybe I needed to lay low for a while. I called an Ubber to go home. 

I hadn't been this tired in a while, my whole body hurt, it felt heavy like I had gained double my weight in a couple of days. I asked the Ubber guy to wait for me. I got home and made a small bag with some clothing and stuff and left. 

I arrived at her place, and it looked even bigger than when she faced-timed me, I rang the doorbell, meanwhile, Brian called me, I didn't pick up the call, texted him saying that I was off and that I would talk to him tomorrow and turned off my data. 

She answered the door, my heart stopped, she had booty shorts and a see-through shirt, her hair was curly and out and about, she let me in and to make myself at home, she went to her room to leave my bag there and we went to the living room, she was watching “The Orphan”, so I just joined. 

We ended up talking for hours, drinking, laughing, all the way to making out. 

We took it to her room, she smelled like a scented candle, her hair like coconuts, and her lips tasted like strawberry gum, I wanted to take it slow but was more excited and almost demanded me to do it. We ended up having sex the whole night, I was surprised I managed to handle it for so long, hadn't had any action in a while, I was even more surprised because of how strong she was for such a small-stature girl… 

I was happy, maybe in love, we stayed the rest of the night together in bed, talking about all the stuff that we wanted to do from now on, but our time was interrupted by a loud bang, Rana got scared, I told her to call 911 while grabbing her chair and opening the room slowly to make as less noise as possible. It was John's kid, he had broken in and was making his way to the kitchen, I went to him asking him if he was ok, he looked at me and started crying, I took a knee to reach his eyes and try and calm him down, he then started to laugh while crying and headbutted me so hard it knocked me out. 

I woke up, tied, hanging from my wrists, with a broken nose and my ankles feeling heavy, in some sort of basement, the walls were bricks, smeared with a sticky substance that looked like dried-up blood, a mosaic floor, and dim white light, so dim that I'd rather be in the dark because of how eye confusing it was, my body was numb, my whole face was swollen, that kid had some power, I started to feel anxious like my body was going to blow up, I looked down and saw Rana, giving me oral, until I came. 

She swallowed everything and then smiled at me, saying that it would probably be enough, she was naked. My heart stopped when I realized that the room was filled with people, John was there, with an empty look, and alongside him was his kid, still, with my blood on his forehead, all these missing people from over the last months were there. 

Rana, came to me, naked and showed me my phone, with 17 phone calls from Ragdall's, Susan's, Brian's, and even my brother's calls along with Brian's message: 

“Dude??! Answer the fucking phone man. Do NOT go to Rana's house, she's involved with the twins, after all, Susan’s brother found some more evidence linking her to them and John is also a family member! Come back to the Bugle!” “Did you read it?” she asked. 

She leaned into my ear, and asked me "Were you so desperate that you believed that I would fall in love with such a pathetic excuse of a human such as yourself?” 

She laid down in from of me and John placed the fetus of the woman that he killed, in front of her vagina, then his kid kneeled between me and the baby while the rest of the people started to chant something, that sounded English at first, but it didn't sound like any known language after a while, I didn't care, I screamed my lungs out, Rana started to chant along with them until her body began to convulse, the sperm that she drank came out her mouth, and some from her vagina as well, her stomach began filling, I didn't know what was I looking at. 

A hand came out of her vagina, I was shivering, I began sobbing, I wanted to leave, and the chanting grew louder like they could hear my inner thoughts even though I was just crying and yelling, Rana was screeching, her eyes had completely rolled up and she was drooling and smiling, the hand reach out and placed itself in the baby's face and began to melt and as it was melting, the fetus grew in size, the baby started to cry, with two voices, and dragged itself towards John's kid, I yelled at him to move, yelled at Rana to wake and take the kid, I don't know why but a part of me thought that she was being forced to do all that. 

The chants were going louder and faster and I was feeling it, the baby wasn't natural, I could smell its energy, its life force, it was heavy on my chest, and it was taking the oxygen from the entire room. The baby slowly stood up, and John's kid smiled at him and helped him up, the baby suddenly grabbed his face and forced himself inside the kid's mouth, I yelled at Rana again to help, but she was out, John's kid came to be as he was dying, he regained his consciousness when it was too late, he looked at me, tears in his eyes, while the baby made itself inside his throat and the same happened, the kid grew a bit more in size almost my size, I'm not a big guy but still. 

I was crying, my mom was right, I should've done something else, have a stable life, if I had done that, I would be fine, the kid, or whatever it was inside the kid, placed his hand on my face and opened my mouth, I tried to bite him, but he'd locked my lower jaw with just two fingers. 

It then said, “Look at me.” I looked toward Rana, she was still twitching and drooling.

I don't know how the kid's skin was black with a tint of red, but I saw the purple and light brown eyes, the same soft touch, but the smile... the same grin, the kid then stabbed his whole arm down my throat and my body just gave up, I felt everything shutting down, I lost control of my bowels, my lungs deflated and ... 

I guess I know why the waiters in the restaurant all look the same, I was one of them, inside a borrowed body, and part of her was inside with me as well. 

Rana was inside the newest restaurant, beautiful as always, eating the most expensive, the most tendered steak with a new desperate guy that fell for her.
