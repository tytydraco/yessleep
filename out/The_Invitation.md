I never thought I'd be the kind of person to fall for something like this. But there I was, alone, confused, and staring down a reality I never thought possible.

It started on a cold autumn evening, colourful leaves falling down on the pavement. I was walking home from the coffee shop, headphones in, listening to my favourite artists, as usual. I didn’t expect anything out of the ordinary that could occur. But that night, the usual sounds of the neighbourhood seemed muffled, almost as if something was pressing down on the air, suffocating the usual bustle of life. It was like all the life had been sucked out of the air by some unthinkable force,

My phone buzzed in my pocket, pulling me out of my trance. It was an unknown number.

“Hey, I saw you at the coffee shop today. I’m right around the corner. I think we’d have a lot to talk about.”

At first, I thought it was surely a stupid prank. Maybe some weird friend of mine was messing around. But the number felt… unfamiliar. I paused, my thumb hovering over the screen, unsure. Should I respond? Why was this person watching me? What did they want?

Before I could make a decision, another text came in: “I know this seems strange, but I’m just looking for some company. You can see me from where you are right now.”

I froze. My eyes darted to the street ahead of me, but I couldn’t see anyone. The hair on the back of my neck prickled, and I quickly typed back a short, sharp response: “Who is this?”

The reply was almost immediate: “You’ll see soon enough. I’m waiting for you.”

I tried to shrug off the feeling creeping up my spine. Maybe it was just some lonely person looking for attention. Maybe it was one of those weird dating scams that pop up every now and then. But I couldn’t shake the sensation that I was being watched.

Then I saw him.

A figure standing under the flickering streetlight. Tall, with dark hair falling in soft waves around his face. His eyes… I couldn’t make them out at first, just two deep, black pools staring at me. And his smile—so perfect, so mesmerizing.

I stopped dead in my tracks, my heart thumping loudly in my chest. Something about him felt wrong, yet… I couldn’t look away.

He took a step closer, his movements graceful, almost ethereal. My mouth went dry.

“You must be Jessica,” he said, his voice deep and smooth, like velvet.

I didn’t know what to say. It was impossible—this was all impossible.

“Who are you?” I managed to whisper.

He smiled wider. “I’m someone who has been looking for you for a long time.”

I backed away instinctively, my feet moving before my mind had time to process. But he was quicker, almost impossibly so. He was in front of me, blocking my way, before I could take two steps.

“You don’t need to be afraid,” he murmured, his lips just inches from my ear. “I won’t hurt you… not yet.”

My pulse skyrocketed. Every cell in my body screamed at me to run, but my feet were frozen to the ground, my limbs stiff with fear.

“I didn’t mean to frighten you,” he continued, his breath cool against my skin, his touch impossibly icy and rock-hard. “But you’ve been so… interesting to watch.”

His hand grazed my cheek, and I flinched back. He chuckled softly, eyes never leaving mine.

“You’re wondering why you feel this way, aren’t you?” he asked, his voice almost a purr. “Why you can’t look away. Why your heart races, and you feel like you’re being pulled in.”

I nodded without meaning to.

“That’s because I’m not just anyone,” he said, his smile turning from charming to predatory. “I’m something more. And you… you are going to be mine.”

He stepped back, and for a moment, I thought I could escape, but then he spoke again.

“You don’t need to run. You can’t escape what you already are.”

I tried to shake my head, but his words seemed to cling to my thoughts, making them heavier, darker.

“Just let me in,” he whispered. “Invite me in. I won’t force you… but if you do, I promise it’ll be worth it.”

His voice was honey-sweet, and before I knew what I was doing, I said the words I never thought I’d say: “Come in.”

His eyes gleamed with victory as he stepped across the threshold, into my personal space. He wasn’t a stranger anymore—he was too familiar, too close. He didn’t even need to touch me to make my skin crawl with electricity.

The moment he crossed that line, something shifted. He was suddenly right next to me again, his lips brushing my ear as he murmured, “You’ve made a terrible mistake, my dear.”

I felt my heart slow, my vision blur, and something within me twisted with a hunger I couldn't place. His smile widened, revealing sharp, gleaming fangs.

But instead of immediately attacking me, he toyed with me. He circled me, his presence overwhelming, filling the room with an intoxicating scent I couldn’t identify. He spoke in soft, coaxing words, keeping me just on the edge of madness. His voice slid into my mind, planting thoughts I didn’t want to have, thoughts of him, of us, together.

I felt myself becoming weaker, more vulnerable with every passing minute, unable to escape the web he was weaving around me.

Eventually, I could no longer tell where he ended and I began. The darkness he offered was becoming my own.

Just when I thought I might pass out, his fangs sank into my neck.

The pain was blinding at first, and then there was nothing. No pain. No fear. Just a cold, consuming stillness.

And then, there was power.

I collapsed into his arms, my body trembling as the transformation took hold. He didn’t need to say anything. The change was already happening, deep inside of me.

"You’re mine now," he said, his voice full of dark triumph.

I could feel it—the thirst. The need. The hunger. Sharp fangs painfully emerged from my jaw, my body adjusting to the changes that this creature had caused.

And now, I understand. You’re probably wondering why you’re reading this, aren’t you? You’re curious, maybe even skeptical. But you know something’s off. And that’s why I’m telling you this now.

The moment you finish reading this, the curse will be on you.

You’ll be stalked by someone just like him—a handsome, dangerous creature, who will lure you in. You’ll be tempted to invite them in, just like I did.

And then, like me, you will belong to them.

Don’t say I didn’t warn you.
