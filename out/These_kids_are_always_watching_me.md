I remember exactly when it all began. When I first felt like I was being watched. It was a tiring Tuesday—I was heading home after a long day at work. I’d been rotting in the office since morning, well into the late afternoon.

The only upside to days like this was that at least the summer heat had died down a bit by the time I left.

I was sitting on the subway with nine stops to go. I couldn’t wait to get home to the girls—to hug my daughter, Sarah, and enjoy one of Janice’s amazing dinners.

I was thinking about dinner, sitting on the half-empty train, when I noticed the boy.

I remember him like it happened just now. He was holding his mother’s hand, getting ready to get off at the next station. His face was flushed, probably from soccer practice—he was still wearing his jersey. Just a regular school-aged kid. Except for his expression.



He was staring at me. But not like a curious child. It was a look I can hardly describe. As if he knew all my secrets. As if he was looking at me with disgust, with judgment.

I never considered myself a bad person. I hadn’t done anything to deserve a look like that.

The blond boy didn’t take his eyes off me. He didn’t even blink.



It was terrifying. I felt confused, nervous, and exposed. I didn’t know where to look, what to do with my hands. I was sweating under his gaze. Thankfully, their stop came, and his mother reminded him to pay attention—they had to get off.

I tried not to look again, but as they walked away on the platform, the boy kept staring.

With that same piercing look. He watched me until they disappeared behind the columns.

Only then could I breathe again.



When I got off the subway, I couldn’t think about anything else but the little boy. Why did he look at me like that? Was something on my face? Did he really have something against me? I didn’t understand why it had shaken me up so much.

I stood at the crosswalk. The light was red. A car waited nearby, windows rolled down in the summer heat. I was lost in thought when I noticed a teenage girl in the backseat. Maybe 14 or 15. The glow from her phone lit up her face in the dim car. And she was staring at me.

With the same expression as the boy on the subway. My heart almost stopped.

I couldn’t look away—her judgmental, disgusted gaze pierced right through me. But she was also moving her mouth. Muttering. Constantly. Her eyes never left me—as if she could see into my soul.

Thankfully, the light turned green, and the car drove off. But even as they left, she kept watching me. I was on the verge of breaking down.I just wanted to go home. Sit down. Eat. Sleep. Fucking Tuesdays…



When I got home, Janice greeted me cheerfully. But she could tell something was wrong. I blamed it all on work, didn’t say a word about the two kids. It was better this way – maybe I was just hallucinating from exhaustion. My daughter wasn’t home; she was spending the night at a friend’s place. I didn’t even know about it, especially considering she was leaving for camp with the school the next day – I wouldn’t see her for a whole week. Janice and I talked a little, just about the usual things: how work was, which bill had arrived, and that a new neighbor had moved into our apartment building – a nice little family. But I was very tired, so I thought it best to just go to bed. 



In the morning, I headed to work feeling refreshed. Janice wasn’t home anymore; she usually went jogging at this time in the summer because the air was still nice. She teaches at a school, so she’s off work during the summer break. I wish I could do the same, but the company wouldn’t survive half a day without me.



After my morning routine, I was waiting for the elevator, and that’s when it started again. The new neighbor showed up—a young, pretty woman, with her toddler son beside her, maybe four or five years old. The woman greeted me, and I politely returned the greeting. Then she told her son to say hello to the gentleman.

That’s when I saw it. The kid was staring.

I swallowed hard. 

The woman was talking—I could hear her voice—but I wasn’t listening. I just stared nervously at the kid. 

He just looked at me, judgingly, almost angrily, and he was muttering. I could see his little mouth moving while he stared at me with those blue eyes.



I just kept staring at him too, like some obsessed maniac. And the kid kept staring back with that same look.



I only snapped out of it when his mother picked him up. I looked at her and didn’t know what to say. She was giving me a strange look while holding her son close. Finally, she just said the elevator was here, but they had forgotten the boy’s hat and were going back to get it.



I got into the elevator and, like a robot, pressed the button for the ground floor. As the doors closed, I muttered angrily:



– What the fuck is going on?



I decided, given everything that had happened, to take the car instead. Well, that turned out to be a bad idea.



No matter where I went, kids were staring at my car. I could see them—even just out of the corner of my eye. They were watching me inside the car, with their accusing, evil gazes.

They were already driving me insane by mid-morning.



At one intersection, while I was waiting, a school bus pulled up next to me. In every single window, those little bastards were hanging there, staring at me in the car, judging me, full of disgust—and all of them muttering. 

I figured it was best to just cover my face. I was getting more and more tense. Why were they staring? What did they want from me? What were they saying?



The honking of the car behind me snapped me out of it. The bus was already far gone, and the honking from behind was getting more and more impatient—why wasn’t I moving?



Eventually, I made it to work. Never thought I’d be this happy to see that place, but maybe—just maybe—there wouldn’t be any damn kids here. The whole morning passed without [incident.Work](http://incident.Work) was piled up—at least three unfinished projects were waiting for me, and I also had to review the company’s tax matters before the end of the month—just the usual load of crap.



But even here, peace didn’t last long. I was rubbing my eyes, tired, trying to focus on work, but thoughts of those kids kept creeping back in. Then I looked up from behind my monitor—and saw her. Standing at the office entrance, right in my line of sight from my desk, was a little girl. Blonde pigtails. Wearing a comfy summer dress. Freckles on her little face. And she was staring at me.



Rage filled me. Seriously—can I not have peace anywhere?

I jumped up from my chair and stomped over to the girl. I grabbed her arm—maybe a little too roughly—and dragged her with me to the break room. From the corner of my eye, I saw my coworkers watching me with confusion, maybe shock, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to be left the hell alone.



I brought the girl into the office kitchen, stood her in front of the fridge, grabbed her by both little shoulders, and barked at her:



– WHAT DO YOU WANT?



The girl didn’t answer. She just kept looking at me with that same weird expression—staring straight into my face. Judging. Mocking. Muttering so softly I couldn’t make out a word.



I lost it. I shook her by the shoulders and shouted:



– What the fuck do you want?! What’s wrong with you?! What do you want from me?!



One of my coworkers pulled me back to reality. He touched my shoulder from behind and asked if everything was alright. As soon as I let go of the girl, she took off running. I didn’t even know what to say to my coworker. I didn’t know why I was so freaked out anymore.



I ended up in my boss’s office, where he and a woman from HR had a talk with me. The girl I shook turned out to be the daughter of one of the women from accounting. Because of the school break, she had brought her in for the day. Luckily, they said they wouldn’t press charges or fire me. But I’d be put on a short forced leave.



I sat in my car in the parking lot for a few hours, maybe. I didn’t dare go home. My only comfort was that at least I wasn’t fired from my job. It paid well, and with all the loans, I needed the money. So I just sat there for a while, mostly with my eyes closed, trying not to think about those damn kids. I didn’t understand—how the hell does no one else see how these kids are staring at ME?



On the way home, I didn’t care about anything. I saw it was happening again—just like in the morning. Kids walking with their mothers stared at my car and followed me with their eyes. At the playground I always pass, all the brats were staring out at me. But I didn’t care—I acted like I didn’t even see them.



At home, Janice was watching TV. She was really surprised I came home so early. But she was even more shocked when I told her everything that had been happening to me since yesterday. She acted understanding—she always was like that. But I could tell she didn’t know what to make of it. In the end, she said maybe it’s for the best that I’m on a break—at least we can enjoy each other’s company while Sarah isn’t home for a few days.



I spent two whole days at home. Together. Just like before Sarah was born. We just lounged around all day, watched dumb shows, and yes—for the first time in a long time—we made love again. Those two days were relaxing. I almost forgot how much I loved being around Janice.



On the third day, she convinced me to go out for a short walk with her. I thought I’d try, for her sake. Unfortunately, I didn’t get far. The moment we stepped out of our apartment building, there was a little boy eating ice cream on the corner. And the second I appeared on the street, the kid started staring at me. With his messy little face, he glared at me—angrily and hatefully. He even stopped eating his ice cream, just stood there muttering something I couldn’t understand.



I bit my lip nervously. It was infuriating—two days had passed and we were right back where we started. So it wasn’t just exhaustion. Janice looked at me strangely, not understanding what was happening. When I told her the kid was staring at me again, she said the boy was just licking his ice cream, his face covered in chocolate, and that he wasn’t paying any attention to me at all.



We went back inside the apartment. The mood wasn’t so light anymore. Janice wanted me to go see a doctor—I didn’t agree. I’m not crazy. Something’s wrong with the kids—they stare at me. And the way I know I’m not the insane one is because adults don’t look at me. Not even the teenagers—just the damn little brats.

Janice and I argued a little. I slept in Sarah’s room for two nights. Then I apologized and agreed to see a doctor.

The next day, I went to a psychiatrist. Janice didn’t come with me, since Sarah was coming home today—she had to pick her up from the bus station. The doctor diagnosed me with early-stage paranoid schizophrenia. He gave me a bunch of medications and said I could come to therapy three times a week. On the way home, I told Janice everything over the phone—what the doctor had said. That helped me make it home without breaking down or focusing on how many kids were glaring at me in disgust. For a moment, I felt a bit of hope again—if I followed the instructions properly, maybe my life could get back to normal.

But at home, the crash came again.

Because when I stepped through the front door, Sarah didn’t run up to hug me with her usual cheerful smile. She just stood there in the entryway, staring at me, muttering. Her sweet little face was angry and full of contempt. I was stunned—I just stared back at her. Janice was watching me from the kitchen with a strange look, so I forced myself to pretend everything was normal— to hide the fact that not even my own daughter was an exception to this madness.

I walked over to Sarah and hugged her. Her expression didn’t change in the slightest—she just watched me and muttered something unintelligible. Then, as if everything were completely normal,  I went straight to the bathroom and locked the door.

I took my meds, and I kept going to therapy. My doctor prescribed even stronger drugs, and he even gave me the card of a special therapist who used hypnosis to treat delusions. But the visions didn’t go away. And I swear on anything—they weren’t hallucinations.

Luckily, at home I didn’t see much of Sarah. Janice kept her busy, constantly taking her somewhere or letting her go out with her friends. I simply couldn’t handle it when she was home. She kept staring at me—I saw it in the mirror, in the reflection of the TV, from the corner of my eye. I just couldn’t take it. Most of the time, I locked myself in the bedroom and just sat there, hunched up.Janice tried to be supportive, but since she didn’t see anything unusual,  it was hard for her to understand what I was going through.

Three weeks passed. I followed the doctor’s instructions to the letter, but there was no improvement. I didn’t even go outside. Whenever Sarah came home, I locked myself away like some lunatic, just so I wouldn’t have to see her.

The medication didn’t help. The doctor had prescribed the strongest ones, and I sometimes took even more than I was supposed to—just to make the fear go away. But the only effect was that my brain felt like a soaked sock. Most of the day, I just sat in the dim light, half-sedated, staring blankly at the TV.



So I decided to stop taking the pills.Instead, I’d try to figure out what the hell was going on. Why do I see the kids like this? I hadn’t taken my meds for a few days, but I pretended I was doing better. Even Janice didn’t seem suspicious anymore. During the day, I scoured the internet, hoping to find something, some similar story. But nothing—most of the pages just talked about schizophrenia. But I knew it wasn’t that. I was absolutely sure. I even managed to hide the fact that I still saw Sarah that way. At least… until that night.

Janice had gone to bed a few hours earlier and had already fallen asleep. She’d put Sarah to bed before that. I was still up, browsing on my laptop, hoping to find some story similar to mine. But I was feeling incredibly tired, so I decided to go to sleep. I lay next to Janice in bed, staring at the ceiling. No matter how exhausted I was, I hadn’t been able to fall asleep properly for weeks. And tonight was no different.

That’s when I saw a little girl standing in the bedroom doorway. I couldn’t see her face clearly in the dark, but I knew she was staring at me. It was Sarah. She wasn’t asleep. She was just standing there… watching.

It was probably the lack of sleep, the frustration of endless days of useless searching—or at least that’s what I told myself—but I suddenly snapped. Furious.

I leapt out of bed and charged toward the door. I saw Sarah’s silhouette run back to her room. I chased after her, shouting.

I flipped on the light in her room. She was sitting in her bed, staring at me with that same infuriating, hateful, contemptuous look. I grabbed her little bedside lamp and smashed it full force against the wall. I screamed:

– What the hell do you want from me?! Why are you staring at me like that?! I’ve had enough!

But she just sat there. Completely still. Still glaring at me. Not a single change in her expression. Just that quiet, muttering. Her lips moving, but I couldn’t understand what she was saying.

I just kept smashing whatever I could reach.Janice ran in, yelling that I’d lost my mind, begging me to stop. But I didn’t listen. My rage had taken over completely.

By the time I calmed down, I was sitting on Sarah’s bed, panting. The room was wrecked. Sarah and Janice were gone. They’d left me there—and I didn’t blame them.



I drank all night. I went down to the store, bought as much booze as I could carry, and drank until I blacked out.

I woke up the next day with a horrible hangover. I can't handle alcohol well, and it had been a long time since I last drank. It must’ve been Sunday. Janice sent me a voice message. She said we needed a break. That I was a danger to Sarah. She’d cried through the whole night. They’d moved in with her mother.



It crushed me. I know it was my fault. I should’ve kept pretending, should’ve kept up the act that her stare didn’t bother me. But it felt like she could see into my soul. Like she knew every single thought I had. That day I just rested. I didn’t want to think about anything.Then I was disturbed again—this time not by children.

My boss called, asking when I could return to work. They really needed me. I stood there among the wreckage and said:

I’ll come in tomorrow.



I don’t know what pushed me to say that. But that night, I got drunk [again.It](http://again.It) was just easier that way. I woke up feeling like absolute shit. A liter and a half of vodka doesn’t make for a great dinner. I scraped myself together, threw on my shirt and suit. Even put on sunglasses— the light was unbearable. 

Somehow, I made it down to the street. I’m not proud of it, but I threw up into one of the trash cans. Then I headed toward the subway. I felt awful. The only upside was that, for once, I didn’t care about the damn kids staring. At least now they had a reason— I was stumbling, reeking of booze.



I only half remember how I got to the intersection. It wasn’t far from my workplace. A crowd was gathered at the crosswalk, waiting for the light to change. I was leaning against the traffic light pole, hungover or maybe still drunk. I don’t even know anymore.



That’s when I heard a kid’s voice. I hadn’t heard a single child’s voice since all this madness began— just that fucking muttering. Now, just a few words:

— Might. Be. Better.

I turned around slowly. A little red-haired boy stood there, staring at me with anger and disgust. His mouth kept moving, still muttering. I couldn’t understand a word. And I lost it again. I couldn’t stop myself. I grabbed his shoulder and squeezed as hard as I could.

Started shaking him:

— WHAT DID YOU SAY?! SAY IT AGAIN, YOU LITTLE SHIT! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU SAY?!

I screamed, spit flying from my mouth. I didn’t give a damn who saw me.

Then came the punch. Huge. I hit the ground. My sunglasses flew off, and my lip split open. A massive guy was standing next to the kid. You could tell he didn’t like what I’d done. He stepped over and kicked me four, maybe five more times.

Everything was hazy after that. I sat there on the ground for a while, leaning against a fence. Somehow, I dragged myself into work—only to be fired on the spot. I tried to talk my way out of it, said I was the one who got attacked. But the stink of alcohol was pouring off me. To be fair, the company was decent enough to give me a solid severance package.

From there, it was a straight descent into the abyss. I had no one left—only alcohol. For a while, I tormented myself: why was this happening to me? What did I do to deserve this? But eventually, I drowned it all in booze. Unfortunately, not even that silenced everything. I just started acting more and more erratically. I kept calling Janice whenever I was drunk— for weeks— until she finally blocked my number. She sent me only one message: she was sorry it had come to this, but I wasn’t myself anymore. I took my anger out on the apartment. Smashed everything I could get my hands on. Liquor bottles lay scattered everywhere, and I’d stopped caring about hygiene completely.

This went on until one morning I woke up in a park. I had no idea how I’d gotten there— probably went out to buy more booze, then just laid down and passed out. It was the park nearby. We used to go there with Sarah—we’d feed the ducks. I didn’t know what time it was, or even what day. The sun was shining warm and bright, and it hurt my eyes.

Even so, I noticed the woman sitting by the pond with her daughter, feeding ducks. But the girl wasn’t watching the birds—she was staring at me. That same contemptuous, mocking expression I’d seen so many times before. 

My booze-soaked mind snapped into aggression again. And I deeply regret what I did next.

I walked up to them and started hitting the little girl—as hard as I could. The mother tried to stop me, but I grabbed her too and just kept punching her—with my fists— until everything went dark.



It only lasted a few moments. Then suddenly my brain clicked back— the alcohol felt like it evaporated from me. I stood there, beside the beaten bodies of the woman and child, next to the duck pond.



Then I did the only thing I could think to do.

I ran. As fast as I could.



I ran home, threw a few things into an old gym bag. I put on a worn-out baseball cap and that ancient denim jacket I used to wear when I was young. Grabbed whatever money I had left and walked away from the apartment.



I spent the whole day wandering the city. Avoided the main roads, took the metro, rode buses, sometimes just walked aimlessly. I didn’t even know where I was anymore. But no one came looking for me. Not the police, not the neighbors— not even Janice.

I slept on the street— in alleys, underpasses. Sometimes I bought a little alcohol, but I didn’t guzzle it like before. I drank just enough to numb the fear. Within weeks, I had become a filthy, reeking homeless man.

But at least now the kids had a reason to stare. Because they still did— with the same damned look in their eyes. And they still muttered. Every last little bastard just kept muttering nonsense.

I wasn’t trying to find a reason anymore. I didn’t even care that much. It was annoying that they stared— but I was a bum, and maybe I’d killed two people. I saw myself as a piece of shit too.

But honestly, I was getting by okay. I walked the city all day, and when I felt like it, I lay down somewhere and slept, or bought a bit of booze. It was all going pretty well— until that fucking intersection.

One morning I was just walking— wherever my feet took me— and I ended up at a large intersection.I knew this area— I used to pass through here often on my way home from work.

There was already a crowd waiting at the crosswalk for the light to turn green. You always had to wait a long time here. I joined the people, and almost everyone subtly stepped away from me. Except for one little girl holding her father’s hand. As I stood behind them, the girl turned around and looked back at me over her shoulder. With that same disgusting expression as all the others. And of course— she was muttering. But then the muttering became words. Just a few. But I heard them clearly:

— You... should’ve... been better.

I acted without thinking. I regret my sins. I deserve what’s coming to me.

I shoved the girl— hard. She stumbled out onto the road— just as the bus was arriving. All I heard was the screeching of the brakes— but it was too late. Blood splattered across my face.

Just like before, my first instinct was to run. But this time I didn’t make it. Some nearby people tackled me, held me down on the pavement. Everything became a blur, my mind sinking into the depths. I was barely even there. I saw only one thing: not far from me stood a little boy, staring at me. With disgust. With anger. And he was muttering.



In court, they declared me insane. I didn’t speak. I didn’t fight the verdict.

Even I no longer believed I was sane. This—this is where everything had led me.  They locked me away in a psychiatric facility. Constant supervision, 24/7. Danger to society, they said. They pumped me full of medication—I was sedated nearly all day. Orderlies watched me constantly, and at least three doctors examined me every single day. There was only one good thing about the ward: there were no children.

One evening, a new orderly brought me dinner. I always ate in my private isolation cell— the doctors said group settings weren’t good for me.

The young man was calm. He set the tray down and then leaned against the wall, watching me eat. Dinner was rice, boiled carrots, and some kind of meat.

Then—he stepped closer. I looked up at him— and my blood turned to ice.

He stared at me with contempt and scorn. Panic flooded me. It was happening again. Even through the fog of medication, I felt the fear rising.

But this time...maybe I deserved that look. I’m a child-killing lunatic. I’m right where I belong.

The man kept staring,now standing almost right beside me.

Then he said:

— Maybe you should…should have been watching the kids.
