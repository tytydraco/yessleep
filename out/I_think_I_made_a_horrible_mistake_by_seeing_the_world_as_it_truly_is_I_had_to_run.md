Hello all, I'll start out by addressing something I noticed was brought up in [the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/170qpbu/i_think_i_made_a_horrible_mistake_by_seeing_the/). My right arm was bitten, but my left is missing nowadays. Things like this, I don't even really notice anymore. Seeing a person get devoured and come back now and then is much more unexplainable but common nowadays in this odd, nonsensical world I find myself in. Even Emma, who I think was eaten soon after the ritual, I've talked to now and then. Sure, other people don't see or acknowledge her, but she's there; I've seen her move things, and people react to them. I don't know when my right arm became the one that was remaining; I know that my left wasn't the one consumed, and I remember struggling with my non-dominant arm for a few months, but I've always had bigger things to worry about, and having my dominant arm be the one I still have, I wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth.  
  
Over the last couple of days, I've had to relocate. The thing in the distance noticed me and was very obviously closer than the day before, when I fell asleep. This has led to me being where I am now. A pacific island.  
  
  
This isn't an outcry or something like that; I don't think that I am being run around by these things; I just think I did something I wasn't supposed to by continuously observing that giant thing in the distance. I know that the large spiraling thing boring into the earth caused me to be paralyzed after looking at it for over a minute when I tried to observe it in the past. But I didn't think that those grotesque things in the distance could even move. I took a flight far away to the island before I could find out what would happen. My gut instinct tells me that it would've been unimaginably bad, so much so that I didn't even care that my plane was covered in a nasty-looking carapace and seemingly blinking at me.  
  
  
When I first arrived here, I noticed that it seemed calmer, for a lack of other words. My dread seemed to settle a little; there were no horrid things in the distance, and I could only see one of those spiraling things off in the distance. It was... odd to see things almost normal here. I decided to walk around, taking in the bloody, meaty landscape that was honestly peaceful here.  
  
  
I was eventually led into a false sense of security, and once I let down my guard, I saw an effervescent glowing light near the edge of town, near a forest, and I was compelled to follow it. This wasn't the odd thing, though; I felt calmer than I ever was, even before this whole mess. That set off every alarm bell in my mind, and I started to want to walk away, but my body wouldn't listen. If you've ever had sleep paralysis, imagine that, but knowing you're probably walking to a very painful death during it. I was only able to escape once I heard one of those gnawing noises, and I don't think I was meant to. When the thing seemed to notice that I heard it, the light disappeared, and I ran back to the center of town.  
  
  
On lighter news, I saw something that looked oddly cute. It was a scaled, four-legged thing with a slimy tail. The best way of describing it was if someone tried to make a dog without knowing barely anything about them. When it initially noticed me, I was ready for it to try and harm me, and it quickly sprinted and jumped at me. I put my remaining arm up, ready to lose that one as well, and it just kind of nuzzled it.  
  
  
The next day, there was a horrid screeching noise in the forest, and while I would've just gone about my day and ignored it, I noticed something. Someone in the crowd of people who looked decidedly less devoured by those things was flinching away from the noise. I walked up to them, and they seemed put off by my cleaner, less eaten look. I just asked them, "Do you hear it?" "What?" they responded, confused and wary. "The screeching in the forest. Do. You. Hear It?" I asked again, firmer. "Y-yeah." they stuttered out. "My name is John; what's yours?" I asked. "M-Morgan," they sheepishly replied. I looked down at their androgenous, scared face and tiny, malnourished form, which was blindfolded, but looking directly at me. "Pretty name; how long have you seen these things and heard them?" "Y-years? a decade? I-I don't really remember the last time I didn't see them!" Morgan stuttered quickly. "They're odd and scary, though; I mostly just stay in town with people where it's relatively safe!" I nodded at them. "Well, I'll see you around, girly!" I told Morgan before walking off. "I-Im a boy, though!" He shouted at me indignantly, and I just laughed and waved back at him.  
  
  
So far, this place hasn't been that bad. Morgan has shown me an odd pit with teeth in it that growls every day at around 6 p.m. here, and I've shown Morgan that those dog-like things are docile. It just feels... nice to finally have someone to talk to when I'm not running around, avoiding things that terrify me. Morgan has also opened up a bit about his blindfold. Apparently his blindfold was an attempt to not see anything, but it ended up just blocking out the more incomprehensible things he was seeing. He still sees through it, just less. Maybe it's worth looking into. idk.  
  
  
That glowing light seems to be trying harder and harder to take me, and I'm scared of what will happen if it succeeds one day. I saw a girl with her parents be lured off by it, and when I asked them, they didn't even acknowledge that she existed. I think she truly did stop existing for those who don't see. I just hope that whatever that thing is isn't worse than what I was running away from, but it seems pretty easy to avoid. Just stay away from the treeline. I noticed that the unnatural growl brought me out of its trance, so I'm going to record one of the dog things, growls, and have it play every thirty seconds or so when I'm close to the forest. Hopefully, it will prevent the light's trance from enthralling me.  
  
I think I have to explore more of the forest to find out if it really is mostly safe here. There are noises in there, but seeing as that dog thing growls horrendously, it might not be bad. But I just have to make sure. I don't want either me or Morgan to end up getting hurt or killed if, for some reason, we have to get out of town for a while. It might not end up happening, but more knowledge and possible plans are useful. The ocean was full of terrors even in the mundane world, so I don't think that the ocean is a possible option if the town becomes unsafe for whatever reason. I shudder thinking of what monstrosities might be lurking in its depths. Wish me luck, friends!
