This definitely isn’t the creepiest or scariest story, but at the time it scared the shit out of me (excuse any grammar mistakes; English isn’t my first language).

Me and my friend often go on vacation to this village near the sea and right next to a forest. One summer we were there, we decided to go on a short late-night bike ride out of pure boredom. It was around midnight. We thought it would be fun to visit a local playground since it would probably be empty, and we just wanted to fool around.

When we got there, we instantly got a weird vibe. It was incredibly dark, and the forest surrounded the whole place. After a couple of minutes, we turned around and decided instead to ride along the sea. The lane was pretty narrow, so I was riding behind my friend, and I had my phone’s flashlight on so I could at least see a little.

We rode without seeing anything strange until we passed by the place we were staying at. That’s when I saw her. A woman in a white windbreaker was sitting on a bench, staring into nothingness. When I turned to look at her face, my blood ran cold. Her face looked completely melted off. It didn’t look like normal aging—it looked like her skin was sliding down in heavy folds. The skin under her eyes drooped almost to her mouth, and her cheeks hung unnaturally low. I didn’t see eyes, or maybe they were just completely black. I only caught a glimpse as we passed, but the image burned into my head.

A few metres later, I turned my head back. She was looking right at us. I wanted to scream, but I tried to stay calm since my friend had told me before the ride that if I saw anything scary, not to mention it. She scared easily, and I didn’t want to panic her.

We stopped a couple hundred metres away near a little patch of sand to rest, and my friend noticed how shaken I looked. She kept pressing me, so I finally told her what I saw. She admitted she thought it was odd that someone was sitting out there so late but hadn’t looked at the woman’s face. We sat there trying to collect ourselves, and eventually decided we had to head back.

On the way, we prayed the woman was gone—and thankfully she was. We ran straight to our rooms once we got inside. A few minutes later, though, we started hearing scratching noises coming from the floor. We brushed it off as mice, but when we checked, there was nothing. Then I noticed something near the window: what looked like blood dripping from the ceiling.

Over the next few nights, I kept seeing her in the corner of my eye. We even tried to recreate the lighting with my phone to convince ourselves it was just a trick, but nothing we did looked even close to what I saw that night.

I’m still creeped out thinking about it and probably won’t forget that face for a long time.
