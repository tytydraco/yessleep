  
So today I've got a less-than-happy update. If you are just getting here, here are parts [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mrgydz/im_no_longer_possessed_by_my_dead_wife) and [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mt20xs/im_no_longer_possessed_by_my_dead_wife_part_2). I would’ve done this sooner, but my house doesn’t have any power. Also a small detail I’m not mentioning.

I was unconscious for the entirety of Monday and Tuesday.

Small, incredibly minor detail, somewhat important, I’m assuming.

Whatever this is… It’s getting stronger, but I still need help. Reality is slipping. I’m seeing things. Horrible things. Three weeks isn’t enough time.

The drums pound endlessly. As well as the wailing, screaming, chanting—whatever you want to call it. 

The smell of burning flesh. The smell of iron. 

I stare across the lobby and… I don’t even know what I’m looking at anymore. My back might hurt from lurching forward, but it's better than seeing whatever is just over this laptop's screen.

Let me back up a little. Today when I came to, I was overwhelmed with a nauseating smell. I instinctively knew I was in the basement on account the room was shrouded in an unbreachable darkness. The surface I was standing on was unsteady, which made me hesitate. I tried to suck in air but I coughed instead. When I tried to adjust myself, I stumbled. Something held me in place and pulled taut against my body. The sound of it stretching immediately told me what it was. A rope.

My vision adjusted ever-so-slightly to the darkness. My fears were confirmed. The noose was attached to the wooden joists above me. Something was itching for me to take a step forward and kick the chair free.

If I was unsure if my life was in danger before? I’ve never been more certain now. I carefully undid the contraption around my neck and stepped off the dining room chair. Something reached for me and I stumbled my way from its grasp. I didn’t have a good look at it and I wasn’t staying to find out.

My brain must’ve blocked out the wailing, because at that moment it was deafening. It hasn’t stopped since. I planted one foot on the stairs and nearly bashed my head into the wall. Tracing my finger across their edge I noticed they were coated in some sort of oily substance. My legs shook as I tried to balance myself. I couldn’t help but think of my wife at this moment.

When I reached the top of the stairs, the house was utterly destroyed. My immediate worry was how much time had passed. The morning sun was illuminating the living area, so I knew it wasn’t nighttime. Then I wondered what day it was. I followed the rules of the ritual. 

Monday I wake up in the forest, so I know it wasn’t Monday. 

Tuesday I wake up in the shed, so I know it wasn’t Tuesday.

Wednesday I wake up at the bottom of the stairs. You can guess where the chair was.

I didn’t have to check my phone after that. I knew it was Wednesday. 

Not that I would’ve been able to find my phone or anything relevant to my identification at this point in time.

I tried to find it though, something familiar caught my eye. Different knives lined the counter top. A bowie, several kitchen knives, a butterfly and others I don’t know the name of. They were all in a row like it was taunting me. It’s like this thing was trying to figure out which one to stab me with. Every drawer was pulled from its housing as well. They were stuffed with random items like plastic cards, hair ties, food, glass, utensils. 

God, you fucking name it.

I made my way upstairs to the second floor. These stairs weren’t coated in that oily substance (thank God). A radio quietly talked to itself from behind a closed door. It was in the guest bedroom.

A part of my heart sank. That radio was only ever on when my wife was alive. I opened the door and the window was broken again.

Then my eyes locked towards the bathroom. The bathroom I wake up in on Sunday. The door was wide as a black snake made its way from the bathroom countertop socket into the bathtub behind the curtains. I pushed the curtains aside and my toaster was sitting there. My mind drifted towards Sunday… I’m just glad it wasn’t Sunday.

There are times that despite our best efforts, sadness overtakes us. Things will be beyond our control. There’s something I can always rely on in times like this. 

Earlier I told you the story of my wife and our first date to that botanical garden in Florida. Those were better times and being reminded of them is an echo. An echo that reassures me that this isn’t the end. That I only have to hold on a little bit longer. 

A remnant of these echoes overwhelms my senses whenever I smell my roses. It takes me back to the times when I had it all, but hadn’t realized it yet. 

After that I had to walk back into town for like the fourth time now and get my stuff from the motel, which was a bold assumption of it being there. An assumption that paid off because the man at the front desk said I already checked out, but I left a few things behind.

I asked, “Did you notice anything strange me?”

He just shook his head and said, “No, but you did look like you’d won the lottery.”

So now I’m here! I don’t particularly want to go home. One because… well… obviously. Two because I don’t want to clean that mess. I’ll just wait until Friday and the demon inside me will take care of it.

I’m actually writing this from my local café. Did I mention that yet? Don't worry, the Wi-Fi also sucks here. 

I probably smell… not the greatest. At least I’m getting my steps in, right? Things aren’t *that* bad.

Wait… I think that barista just handed a ghost a coffee. Nope. Never mind. I’ve definitely lost it. 

My hands are shaking as I type this, I don’t know if it’s the caffeine or the utter terror. Why doesn’t it kill me? This doesn’t make any sense. Why not just have me wander in the woods until I’m thoroughly lost? Why come back and tear up my place, only to not kill me. This doesn’t make *any* sense. 

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not like I *want* to die. If I’m being possessed by some supernatural entity, why doesn’t it have the power to kill me if it can make me black out for over forty-eight hours? A little logic would be appreciated.

I also probably look crazy. After my three coffees, I ordered tea. I asked them to not give me any water, just the bag. The manager was kind enough to let me borrow some tape. The tea bag is currently sitting under my nose. Did you know chamomile smells really good? Well it does, but not as good as my roses. There are probably better ways of going about this. All I know is chamomile DEFINITELY beats the smell of burning flesh.

You know what the worst part of all of this is? All the fucking food in my fridge is probably spoiled. I’ll have to go grocery shopping when this is all over.

Kidding, of course. Well not about the shopping part. That still has to happen.

Have I told you about my nightmares/visions? I’d be specific on whether it’s a nightmare or a “vision”, I simply don’t have a clue which. All I know is I am walking throughout my home, but it’s a labyrinth. Photos of me on the wall taunt me. At the same time, I desperately try to find something, yet. I can’t. I’m lost, traveling through this silvery substance. I see hundreds of me, all standing in a line.

Then I hear a baby cry. I reach into the crib, but nothing is there.

I’m alone and incapable of stopping this.

It’s almost comforting, in a way. 

Anyway.

In my last post I asked for some movie recommendations. One of you recommended *The Exorcist*, real mature. Quite on the nose if you ask me.

You want to know a good old movie though? *The Shining*. Super slow burn, but that music. Being isolated on a mountain with no way out? Terrifying. Oh, I also really like *The Thing*. That movie is absolute cinema, even though they spoil the end at the beginning, which is lame.

Okay, I’m going to try to go home soon and update you all once I have power. Maybe take a shower. Hmmm… on second thought, probably not.

But first, I feel it is almost our little ritual at this point.

Let me tell you a story about my beautiful wife.

We were in Anchorage in late September. The birds were singing, the sun was shining, and the green grass was never-ending.

It was a lovely day, the temperature being the low eighties, if I remember correctly. A perfect day for a picnic. It wasn’t that gross humidity like in Florida. Just a nice, temperate heat that made you feel welcomed.

Now, a known fact about my wife is that she can’t cook to save her life. She could somehow manage to mess up a bologna sandwich. (Why is bologna spelled like that?) But, she *insisted* that she make lunch for our date.

We lay on the patterned blanket under a shady oak. The basket sat untouched. I feared what monstrosity might lie within.

She made casual conversation. But my mind was focused on what was just below that wooden door.

Neila rolled her eyes and opened the basket. What was revealed even surprised me. The most terrifying thing of all. McDonald’s hamburgers. 

She said, “I wasn’t going to risk it.”

I laughed, watching as she eagerly unwrapped the yellow paper. “That’s why you’re still around, you know when to give up,” I’d say. Then I suggested she start watching the Cooking Channel.

She’d laugh. One of her known insecurities was that I would leave her for a woman who could cook. 

I’d say, “In Anchorage, that wouldn’t be possible.”

I’m torn when thinking about my wife and burying those moments. Sometimes I feel that if I forget her, I can forget my failure.

But I suppose sharing these memories is to someone’s benefit. It at least immortalizes what I’ve done on this website.

It almost feels like my fingers are vibrating, like someone is trying to get out of my skin.

I nearly forgot to mention, I couldn’t stop myself from calling the priests. If it’s my wife who’s possessing me, she deserves to be at rest. If it is something else? Good riddance.

Man… all of these days are blending together. If only I had more time with you all. Before I left home, I took a moment to inspect the power box. The door was off its hinge, yet, there were no sparks or theatrics. They… or I guess *I* cut the main supplying power. 

That’s the part in possession movies they don’t show you. All the things that the possessed version of yourself ruins and now that you’re better, have to be fixed. Procrastination is going to be my friend for a while. I’ll just add it to the list of future problems to take care of. 

On my way out I stopped in my front yard and took a deep breath. Between nearly dying and this whole situation in general. I needed a moment to relax. Glass was scattered by the front door. I looked up at the shattered guest bedroom window and sighed. 

Taking a step back, I inspected my house like it was the first day all over again.

When you move into a place, you have all these ideas of what you’re going to do with it and your plans for the future. A lot of those ideas get shelved. Whether that’s due to tragedy or laziness? I won’t say. But when all of this is over, I need to do something nice for myself. For this place. I’ll take the time to plant some flowers.

The house feels so drab without any flowers.
