It’s 11:57 PM and I find myself struggling to find a matchbook, a lighter, heck a piece of flint as I rifle through my entire house looking for a way to ignite a spark. 

I knew I should have kept better track of time, but the party with my friends in the neighboring town ran late, I had a little too much “celebration”, and I simply let my guard down. By the time I realized my mistake, I had to drive nearly 90 mph down the interstate to make it back home. What a fool!!

I finally realize that I had a small lighter that should be somewhere over the top of the fridge and I’m frantically feeling where I can’t see until I find it. It’s then that I scramble to grab the Roman Candle out of my kitchen drawer and sprint out into the yard. 

The fuse seems to barely take ignition but once it finally stays lit, I hold the firework high overhead and grit my teeth as 5 weak fireballs spout out consecutively overhead. It’s then that I look at my watch. It’s now 12:01 .. on July 5th. 

I hear an almost patronizing but wicked sounding laugh begin to echo and reverberate from down the street from my home and brace myself for the worst. 

Panic sets in as 2015 comes flooding back into my focus like a tidal wave:

I was 17 years old that summer. An early graduate from high school that felt stuck in that time of decision where I didn’t honestly know how to spend my last summer before college in the fall. Most of my friends were still in high school, so most days and evenings after my job at the local burger shack were spent doing whatever mischief 17 and 18 year olds do in the summer. But, I still felt out of place because I knew that I was “suppose” to be more focused before heading into my fall semester at our community college but I still couldn’t seem to break away from the thought that it was all happening way to fast and out of my control.

I should clarify that the little town I grew up in in Indiana was known for its, let’s just say, incredibly patriotic summers. Our town consisted of only 1777 people (for some reason never more and never less) and yet we always had 5 fireworks tents set up all over town, old glory flapped away on almost every home and business, and 3 separate parades took place in July alone. As a teenager you get quite used to it, but little did I know just how sick this whole situation really was. 

I had lived there since age 12 and I do distinctly remember the neighbors greeting us as we moved in sometime in June. They didn’t bring over a pie or casserole though, they insisted on welcoming us to the neighborhood with a small package of bottle rockets. They were quite friendly but kept referencing how much fun we would have shooting them on July 4th. We joked about how obsessed they seemed about the fireworks after they left, but by mere happenstance, we naturally ended up shooting them from our front yard on July 4th that year after I rediscovered them hidden behind a stack of moving boxes.

For a few years I never really thought about it again. After all, I was a teenager in a town full of fireworks and friends that were always looking to blow something up, so of course I shot fireworks every 4th of July. It wasn’t until age 15 that I finally heard the “urban legend” about our little town.


Supposedly this town had been the home of the man who had inspired those oh so famous Uncle Sam posters. Legend says that once he was finished running PR for all those years for the federal government, that he returned home as a very serious and seemingly obsessed man when it came to how our town should feel about patriotism. The need for ample fireworks vendors and parades were apparently at his insistence. It’s been told that he believed every citizen should light a firework on July 4 to demonstrate their loyalty and thankfulness to the red, white, and blue. It was our “duty” to celebrate our freedoms he would say in an almost ominous tone. 

The legend states that several townspeople scoffed at him over his fierce patriotism, but those same people were found deceased on July 5th via a serious of freak accidents. Most chalked it up to coincidence, but they say that “Sam” didn’t even appear in public until the next July and took on a whole new intensity that summer that left most townsfolk willing to simply go along with his demands than to question the whole situation. Therefore, it became the culture of the town that every single citizen, young or old, would light a firework on July 4th in honor of America. They say every few years someone would mock the ritual and they also say that person always found themselves 6 feet under afterwards. At least.. that’s what they say. 

That same Summer of 2015 when I learned all this was the same summer in which I witnessed my first death. Discount Doug’s firework tent had decided to put on a show that evening and most of us teenagers made sure to be there.

Dave himself had actually been so busy selling fireworks that he had joked earlier in the evening that he hadn’t lit one himself all year so he’d keep an eyes out for Uncle Sam. He had some of his younger employees orchestrate the show he put together that night.

I remember it being quite a spectacular show and witnessing most of the town’s population drift away later in the evening. I had stayed because a girl I was crushing on worked for Dave and was helping to clean up after the show so I also chipped in. 

I hadn’t really kept track of the time, but one of our friends remarked that it was 11:54 and we better get our shots in. Being, hyped on testerone and hormones in front of the girl i liked, I pulled an m80 out of my pocket and lit it. I waited until the very last second before throwing it into the air as it exploded mere feet from our faces. I didn’t get quite the reaction I hoped from her. In fact, she called me a creep and to get lost as Dave came running around the corner to chew me out about lighting fireworks near the rest of the merchandise. 

By the time it was all said and done, I apologized and had started to walk away when I started to hear a scuffling of something against the asphalt in the parking lot. That’s when I made out the seemingly frail outline of very old, bent over looking man in a stained and tattered white top hat as he came shuffling towards the fireworks tent. I was just far enough away that I couldn’t make out all of the details but I saw Dave turn to look at the man and drop the box he was carrying the moment he saw him. It was then that the seemingly frail old man straightened up and seemed to grow a foot and a half in height as he towered over Dave and slowly reached his long and pointy index finger out towards Dave and muttered something quite emphatically. 

That’s when the old man pulled out something from under his trench coat and threw it towards Dave. In less time than I can describe it, I quickly realized it was a Molotov cocktail and the immediate chain reactions that ensued from all the fireworks created such a startling glow and abrupt sound waves. Anyone who witnessed it like I did could safely assume that Dave couldn’t have survived the event, yet I saw that old man with the top hat very slowly walk away back into the depths of the parking lot from the direction he originated from with no urgency in his pace as flames surrounded him.

Once the Fire Marshall’s and ems arrived, I told them what I had seen. The police later took my statement. To my dismay, the local newspaper listed the cause of death as accidental ignition according to the official police report. My friends acted like they couldn’t hear me when I tried to talk about it until finally one of them, Greg, pulled me aside and said I’d better wisen up and keep my mouth shut if I didn’t want Uncle Sam to come calling my name. I laughed it off, but the dead look in his eyes caused to stop and realize that perhaps the urban legend wasn’t so legend after all.

So it was in the years that followed that “accidental” deaths occurred every other year or so. Each one being quite dramatic as they took place and freakish in nature. One man, a new resident to town, was found with both his hands blown off with what appeared to be sparkler bombs that had been taped to them. He bled out before help could arrive. Another woman was found burned to a crisp with her car having erupted into flames around midnight from what appeared to have been a firework mortar dropped into her gas tank before she could start it. Even the elderly were not off limits as “old man Jenkins” room in the nursing home blew a shockwave felt all around town when his oxygen tanks erupted. A lone sparkler was found to be the culprit for the ignition.

Indeed, I now understood why everyone answered when Uncle Sam called.

So there I was, this past July 5th, stricken with terror at the sight of Uncle Sam materializing from down the street and towards me. I stepped out into the street myself as perhaps meeting and talking to him would help but I soon realized when I looked into his almost glowing yellowed eyes in the low street lighting that there would be no forgiveness to be found in him, so I did what I’d never heard of anyone else doing; I ran.

I ran with all I had towards the city square and towards any lighting I could find, screaming for help all the way. I soon realized, that if anyone could hear my screams, they weren’t willing to interfere in the ritual. I assumed that it would take a while for the old man to catch up to me but as I came to halt against the gazebo in the town square yard, I could barely catch my breathe when I turned around to see him a mere 6 feet away and staring directly into my eyes. 

That’s when I realized up close that his attire had once been quite colorful with red, white, and blues. His clothing had aged into a tattered mess of off-white and browns. He did as I’d seen in 2017 and began to straighten up in stature as he ungnurled an abnormally long and pointed index finger and pointed it at my heart.

That’s when he half wheezed and half echoed in an unnatural volume, “I .. want.. yooouuuuuu!!”!

As he reached into his jacket pocket I did something I didn’t expect. I sprinted into the gazebo and realized two things: I was now inside a fully flammable structure, and, there were American flags draped over the railings. 

Out of mere desperation, I grabbed one and draped it over my shoulders like a robe to protect myself from the imminent flames and ran back out of the gazebo. The moment we locked eyes again, I saw the immediate confusion in his posture as he stood there, seemingly frozen in place, holding a half lit rocket aimed towards me. 

He, with a complete look of anger and disgust, then turned its aim towards the sky as it launched from his hands and fizzled out in the night sky. 

He didn’t make anymore movements towards me, he only glared with a hatred unworldly, and that’s when I realized that his innate patriotism would never allow him to burn the flag. So, I ran and I never stopped running until I reached my car back home and drove off into the night and out of town. I kept the flag draped over me out of fear at first, but began to relax when I found myself pumping gas at a station 300 miles from home at the break of day. I disrobed from it and was standing there sighing out of relief when I started to hear that same shuffling and cadence emerge from the ally besides that gas station. Before he could fully materialize back into view, I draped the flag back over my shoulders and finished filling up, all the while staring at those almost glowing yellow eyes that were burning with rage.

That’s when I realized what I had to do. 

I’m writing this now, having found a place to live in Toronto after I crossed the border a week ago. I discovered my suspicions to be true that he in fact had no “power” in another nation, so I’ve accepted my fate to live elsewhere for the rest of my life. 

I’m writing this email to everyone back home to remind you: when Uncle Sam calls on July 4th, you sure as hell better answer!
