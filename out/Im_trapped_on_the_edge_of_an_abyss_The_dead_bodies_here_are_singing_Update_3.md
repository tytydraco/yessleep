I had a strange dream the other night.

I was in a desert, but not anything like the ones back home. Back in our world.

It was black like the abyss, the sky a murky shroud of shadow. The sand beneath my feet was obsidian. Tiny, glittering grains that whispered their soft song as it shifted and slid with the wind. The gusts blew hard into my face, the tiny stones it carried stinging my cheeks as I tried to block it with my arm. I couldn’t see much around me; maybe 10 feet or so.

I could hear though.

On the wind came another sound. Soft whispers that I could barely make out. They rode the bellows in confusing patterns, making me unsure exactly of their origin, but as I focused, I pinned it somewhere in front of me. I was so scared that I couldn’t move, and this was only made worse when another sound joined in. Heavy, slow steps pounding into the dunes. Something circling me just out of sight.

“It’s infinite…” I picked out from the chorus of whispers around me. It sounded tired and pained, “All the filth that trickles down…”

Each of the steps was scored by a dreadful cracking sound, like tree branches being ripped apart in a storm. I remember thinking that the only thing it could be was its limbs, but if that was the case, there was no way they weren’t broken to all hell.

The beast in the dark moved closer and closer, but I still couldn’t bring myself to move.

“This place is deeper than hell,” a whisper sobbed with shaky breath,

“It only goes deeper…” another returned.

It was right in front of me now, just barely shrouded by the veil of my vision. I held my breath and shook in place, nearly falling over under the weight of the winds, but I was too stiff to allow even that to happen. My brain screamed at me to move, but it was only a dream, and I was at the mercy of its plot.

I barely caught a glimpse of something large, smooth, and ivory as it began to pierce through the contrasting shadow. Before I could make out what it was or anything about its form, I woke up.

I really didn’t know where else to put that story, but it seems important, so I needed to get it down somewhere…

On a less intense note, Hope is undoubtedly me, but I’m starting to see some differences.

First of all, she’s decidedly more optimistic about everything than I am. Ever since that moment she chose her new name, she practically shook the darkness of this place off her shoulders. She barely seems on edge like I am all the time, or if she is, she’s just better at hiding it. While I have been mostly silent and stoic, still not used to having a new face around, she offers me a smile pretty much anytime we make eye contact.

The main thing that made me notice all of this was when I made a self-deprecating joke to her to break the ice. I don’t even remember what it was because I was so caught off guard by her response.

“Hey, don’t talk like that!” She scolded gently, “You’re great. We’ll, I guess *we’re* great, I should say.”

That was odd. Like, really odd. I think I’ve mentioned that I don’t have a very high opinion of myself, so the fact that my exact copy was saying she thought I was cool felt odd. The fact that she wasn’t even saying it to justify herself was weirder.

All of this may sound like I’m seeing these things as red flags, but it’s not quite that. It’s not like she’s freaking me out or acting suspicious by being nice. I guess it’s just that I haven’t really seen a version of myself like that in a long time. Maybe she was right when she said that we’d have different perspectives on things.

It makes me wonder what about her is so different from me. If she came straight out of my body with all my thoughts and memories, you’d think she’d have an even worse view of things having been dumped here so abruptly. Whatever the case, that mystery is on the back burner for now. We’ve got bigger beasts to report here.

After my last post, we headed up to the radio room to take a look around again, this time with an actual flashlight. Hope had the same reaction I did to the rancid smell of rot in the room, though I tried to warn her.

“Wow,” she choked out, “You weren’t joking.”

“Yeah,” I said back, using the hood of my jacket as a mask, “The um… body is behind the desk over there. That’s where I found the laptop.”

“How long do you think it’s been in here?” She asked, “If it smells that bad, then it has to have been a while.”

“Maybe,” I told her, “Although, everything in this place is rotted to all hell. I’m curious if time works normally here.”

“I guess that wouldn’t be too out of character for it.”

Armed with my phone this time, there was a lot of detail that I had missed my first trip through. For starters, it was trashed way more than I could originally see, but I don’t mean that in the way that the town is falling apart. Most of the equipment up here was actually new and lacked the distinct dust and mold that everything else was painted with. It was smashed to pieces though, like something tore through and took the furniture with it. I had a feeling it was the same thing that had left the pair of legs behind.

Whatever this place was, it was clearly the Kingfisher team’s area of operation. The massive server obelisk that still hummed in the center of the room was also hooked up to more than just the radio tower. There was a whole nest of cables that ran across various corners of the ceiling and into the walls. I followed one that looked like it ran to a window, and following it outside, I could see that it connected to the town’s power lines and ran off into the dark. I wondered if all the other wires did the same.

“Hey, Hen, look at this,” Hope called to me from across the room, an undercut of curiosity to her tone.

I turned to see her standing across the space near the station's recording booth, a wall of monitors and computer stations set up before her. They all looked to be set up by our scientist friends, and one of the larger screens was glowing with power.

“How’d you get that running?” I asked, moving to join her.

“It was already on; I just pressed a button on the board here.” She informed.

The monitor was clearly different from the numerous ones next to it. While those looked to be surveillance monitors (Confirming my theory that we may be being watched), this one was just one large CRT screen attached to a confusing looking control board. On it were a collection of red lines, boxes, and symbols that made no sense to me at first. The more I studied them, however, the clearer it became.

It was a map of the shelf. I could clearly make out the jagged, almond shape of the plateau, and I could parse which side was the cliff face, and the drop into the abyss. A lot of the buildings around the main street of town were accounted for, including the motel, and in front of that, they even had what I assumed to be the vending machines marked. They were represented by a series of three rippling circles, and, text beneath them read ‘*research point A’*.

“Looks like they were a mystery to them just as much as they were to me,” I muttered aloud.

“What do you think these are?” Hope asked, pointing to another symbol on the chart.

There were plenty more. The giant metal door was marked by a triangle that read *‘Kingfisher Main’*, and behind it, we got an idea of what might be waiting.

Dotted outlines of a large space appeared back there; a whole facility a fraction the size of the town. A spot of note in there was an area labeled, *‘imprint processing’,* mirroring the deposit hatch I’d seen by the door, but there was also a stranger one.

It was a circle with a line beneath it, almost like an omega symbol, and it simply read *‘the drill.’*

Those weren’t what Hope was pointing to, though. She was pointing out one of numerous spots on the map that read ‘*Rig 1, Rig 2, Rig 3,*’ and *‘Rig 4’.* They were all represented by a rectangle that flashed solid, then outlined repeatedly. All four of them, each positioned in a different corner of the shelf, had the same words beneath them.

*‘Cell loaded; Malfunction detected’*

“I have no idea…” I said with a furrowed brow, finally answering my clone’s question, “Whatever they are, though, they don’t look like they’re going to be much help to us,” I continued, tapping the malfunction box.

“Those might, though,” Hope noted, pointing to one of the numerous red dots scattered across the map. There had to be over three dozen of them, all in random locations, and while they weren’t labeled on their own, they did appear to have text linked to them. In the top corner of the screen in big letters that flashed to the same tempo as the dots, the words, *‘Imprints Detected’* burned against our skin with its glow.

“That word was on a hatch near the door where I woke up,” Hope said.

“I saw it too,” I nodded in agreement.

“What do you think they are?” She asked, “If we take one to that hatch, maybe something will happen that’ll give us some clues on how to get the door open?”

“We can find out right now,” I told her, tapping on the glass. The radio station also had an icon of its own—a simplified version of its prominent tower—and overlapping it was one of the dots. “There’s one here.”

Hope turned and looked around the space, “Well, what do you think an ‘imprint’ is? I suppose we need to know that to figure out what we’re looking for…”

Stepping away from the monitor, I began looking myself. There wasn’t anything in the space other than the kingfisher equipment that looked out of place, so I couldn’t tell for sure. I pinned it up in my memory as I kept searching the rest of the area, hoping that it might reveal itself the more I dug around.

Despite how long I’d put it off for, I knew that I needed to return to the desk that I’d found the laptop from. I still needed a password, and though I hadn’t seen one upon first inspection, I didn’t exactly look very hard the first time, and my mind had been elsewhere.

Gingerly, I moved toward the lonely pair of legs, trying my hardest to avoid the sticky puddle of blood left in their wake. It was a fruitless effort.

When I reached the desk and shined my light on it, however, I was very glad I’d come back to look. I hadn’t seen it the first time because the laptop was resting atop it, but there actually was a note left behind.

Blood spattered its surface and had soaked its edges from pooling under the laptop, but luckily, it was still legible. Unluckily, it was not a password, and even worse, what it read made me nauseous all over again. 

Hope must have seen my expression in the afterglow of my light, because she moved closer to me, a look of concern on her face, “What? What is it?”

My eyes kept scanning the note, feeling worse with each passing sentence.

“Hensley? What is it? What does it say?”

Looking up at her, I swallowed, then took it from the top.

“Brand,” It began, “I don’t know where you are, but I pray that you’re just hiding somewhere because you couldn’t make it back to the tower in time. Please, please, please, let this be the case. You’re all that I have left now.”

“Poor guy,” Hope muttered, looking at the body, then quickly regretting the decision.

I carried on, “Shae may have fucked us, but we might still a have a shot. That thing destroyed most of the equipment here during its first time around, but I managed to at least fix the tracker and reconnect it to the tower. Now, the bad news is, I don’t know if there’s enough imprints around town to get us home, but the good news is the rigs are all still fully charged. There’s more bad news, though.  They’re malfunctioning for some reason. If we can get them up and running again, we might be able to power the drill long enough to punch a hole back home.”

As I read, I could tell Hope was deep in thought, and while I continued, she moved over to the map again to plot things out.

“It’s a long shot, and I know we lost a lot of people the first time around trying to get them back online, but that was with Shae at the helm, and clearly, he didn’t have our best interests in mind. Admittedly, I’ve never even seen the inside of a rig in person, but if it’s anything like our tech out here, I’m sure I can find a way to fix it up. I’m going to head out to the first location to see if I can’t work it out. I hope that you’ll be back by the time I return. I *need* you back by the time I return. Signed, Juarez.”

Hope, who’d had her face buried in the map since she’d walked over there, finally pulled away to look at me, raising a brow, “That’s… not that bad. If anything, that’s good news! We have a concrete way of how to get out of here! Course’ we still need the door code and to figure out how to fix—”

“That’s… not all,” I cut ‘myself’ off, not wanting to get her hopes up, “He um… must have come back because everything I just read is scribbled out. He wrote another message beneath it.”

Concern blossomed on Hope’s face, and she shook her head, “What does it say?”

Swallowing hard, I read it, “Forget it. You’re dead. I’m dead. Everyone’s dead, and it’s what we deserve. I didn’t know. I swear I didn’t know what we were doing here. Shae, he lied to us. He lied to us all. Maybe there was a chance of escape, but even if there were, I can’t live with myself now. I’m waiting here until that thing comes back. I’d just end it myself, but I’m more afraid of what might be waiting for me in hell. Maybe being a part of its form will be a fate less wretched. I’m sorry, God. I’m so, so sorry.”

 Hope looked like she wasn’t breathing, and I was having a hard time doing so myself. We just stared at each other for an eternity, our imaginations like wildfire about what that note could possibly mean. The more I thought, though, the more despair came to coil around me.

Sensing this, Hope cleared her throat and spoke to distract me, “Hey, um, this room seems important. If we’re going to be up here a lot, do you think we should…?” She asked, pointing to Juarez’s legs.

I eyed them vacantly, forcing myself to detach, then nodded.

Bodies are heavier than you’d expect them to be. Even half of one. It makes sense in hindsight; most people weigh over 100 pounds, but still, looking at something so still and lifeless makes it feel off. Knowing that it once belonged to a living being makes it seem like it should weigh less or something. As if the soul that left it was where the real heft was at.

Hope and I tried not to think about things too much as we grabbed the shoes of the rotting limbs and hauled it onto some long window curtains we’d found next door. Juarez’s cold, rotting flesh peeled off the vinyl with a sick squelching crackle, and a black sludge oozed from the folds of his stomach. It was all both us had to not puke.

 Ungracefully rolling him up, we each grabbed an end of the coffin hammock, then started out of the room. Heading out the front doors of the station, we moved for a back alley across the street. It felt a little ungraceful leaving a dead man's legs in a dank, decrepit alley, but it was really the only place we could think that would be out of sight and mind. It seemed better than just tossing it over the edge into the abyss, and besides, neither of us were really too keen on going near that ledge.

My frail, aching bones were sore by the time we set the now bloodied and rancid drapes behind a dumpster, then Hope and I looked at one another.

“So, what now?” She asked, “What’s the game plan? Do we want to go see what those imprint things are? It seems like our only lead.”

I bit my cheek and nodded, finally tearing my gaze free of the bloody wad we’d just left on the pavement, “Yeah. I suppose.”

“You okay?” Hope asked softly.

I turned to face her, “Yeah, sorry. I’m just curious about what he saw at those rigs that drove him to well… that.”

Hope smiled, “Well, let’s not concern ourselves with those, okay? That note said that those imprint things can get us home if there’s enough of them.”

“Yeah, but he said there *wasn’t* enough…”

“Well, maybe, but who knows how long ago that was written? Whatever they are, there could be more that have popped up since then. Obviously, they were tracking them on that map for a reason. It was probably to see when more were found.”

That actually made a strange amount of sense, and I was a little impressed that an offshoot of me was being so savvy about all of this. I had barely pieced together anything yet.

“How are you being so optimistic?” I asked her.

She just shrugged, “What’s pessimism going to do for us in a time like this?” moving toward me, she patted my arm and spun me around confidently, “C’mon! Let’s go check that map again and get a few locations down.”

We moved back up to the station's top floor, Hope leading the way while I kept my eye on the tower light. I’ve noticed that creatures seem to space themselves a bit after one shows up, but that’s not necessarily a guarantee.

The room smelled marginally better already, but marginally really is the keyword there. Hope and I sucked it up, returning to the imprint monitor, but when we reached it and looked down at the chart again, something caught our eyes.

“Wait a minute,” my clone said, “Where’d the one that was at the station go?”

She was right. The dot that was positioned directly on the tower was now missing.

“Do you think these things, like, disappear or something?” Hope cocked her head at me.

I just shook my own, furrowing my brow down at the screen and searching for any information that might help answer her question. That’s when I noticed a new dot, however. One close to the station while all the other ones had been at least a block or two away. It was parked just across the street from us, tucked between two boxes on the map that marked buildings.

“What the…” I muttered, snapping my head to the window to confirm a quickly brewing theory.

“What? What is it?” Hope asked.

Sure enough. If I was looking in the right spot, then…

I pointed to the speck, then looked at my friend, “Hope, isn’t this where we *just* put Juarez…”

I saw the color drain her face as it dawned on her too, “Wait… yeah. Yeah, it is.”

Suddenly, the red glow from the map on our faces felt much more sinister.

“You don’t think that… all of these dots are…?” Hope began slowly.

I swallowed hard, “I don’t know. I haven’t explored this place enough.”

Hope chewed her cheek, shaking her head, “I don’t understand why they’d call them imprints. I don’t get what they were doing here.”

“Me either,” I told her, grabbing a piece of paper from the desk next to us. Snagging a pen too, I placed it over the screen by the radio tower, then started tracing, marking any dots I could see, “But there’s only one way to know if that’s what these things really are.”

For a fleeting moment, traveling outside a few minutes ago had felt somewhat safe. We knew the rhythm of this place; so long as the light was off, we were in the clear. Now though, walking through the endless dark knowing that this town might just be one big graveyard? Well, the thought of rotting corpses being hidden in every cranny of this place wasn’t exactly a reassuring one.

The nearest dot was a small grocery store on the main street, just across the road from the gas station. Hope and I eyed the wall of cold, black windows with a shudder before moving for the door. They were automatic sliding ones that were shut, but that didn’t matter. They were already shattered to pieces.

The store smelled rancid and noxious, and I felt like each breath was slowly shaving minutes off my already shortened life. Rotting food and moldy surfaces painted everything like a putrid collage, and the rusty metal shelves creaked and groaned softly, as if we were waking this place from a long nap.

On the terminal, the dot looked like it was near the back of the building, so hope and I began making our way there. My heart matched my footsteps as we moved, slow and steady, and I hoped deeply that what we were about to find wasn’t actually going to be a corpse.

I knew the light wasn’t on when we had entered this place, so we were theoretically safe, but still, I couldn’t see the tower anymore, which I really wasn’t a fan of.

As we came to the back corner of the store where a meat deli was, the smell was unbearable. Viscous decayed sludge was behind the display glass, but the scent was more than just the rotten cuts. It was a familiar one that we’d gotten accustomed to back at the radio tower.

Hope and I rounded the counter, and my throat tightened. Splayed out on the tile, a body lay, limbs frozen in clawing agony. Their face was a frozen scream, and their eyes empty sockets where orbs had melted away. There wasn’t any gore, no blood to be found, but I took no solace in that fact. The implications of their death were far, far worse.

Their skin was gaunt and grey, shriveled to their bones like somebody paper mache’d a skeleton. There was nothing left inside the corpse, and it was clear to see why.

I don’t have trypophobia—the fear of clusters of holes—but seeing it on a body is a different experience.

Hundreds of thousands of tiny punctures littered every inch of the victim's skin, even peppering through their clothes. The edges of each one were highlighted with a ring of dark red blood that had escaped whatever tube had slurped it out. The body almost looked like a giant wasps nest now, and all hope and I could do was stare in horror.

“Hensley, I really don’t want to die in this place…” was all she could say.

I agreed whole heartedly.

Swallowing, I spoke sickly, “I guess that confirms it. Imprints are definitely bodies.”

“Why the hell were they collecting them?” hope shook her head, “And how are they supposed to help us get home?”

“I have no idea,” I told her, shaking my head, “But if this is what they were doing in this place, then I’m not sure throwing them down that chute is a good idea. We don’t really know what could happen.”

I could tell hope agreed with me, but she made a very good point as she turned to me with a tragic look, “Do we really have any other options?”

We used a shopping cart to move the body this time. It took a while for me and myself to get the courage to even touch the thing, afraid that it might spring back to life or that some sort of insect swarm might be living inside. With all the things I’ve heard while living here, I really don’t know what to expect anymore.

Once again, my eyes were glued on the radio tower as we moved through the street, more hurriedly this time. I was especially more on edge since we were wheeling a giant metal cage that rattled and squeaked into the silent air as we moved across the bumpy asphalt.

Hope was the one who volunteered to push while I kept a sharp lookout on the tower, and though she now had the flashlight to light the way ahead, I was still making sure to listen out for anything past the cart’s rattling. There was a chance that I might hear a beast shrieking as it scaled the cliffs up to us before the tower even lit up.

That intense focus is what helped me to hear the whispers.

I shot my arm out and grabbed Hope, freezing her in place while my head went on a pivot. When I saw nothing, I snapped my head up to the tower, but the light was still asleep. Even so, it was unmistakable; I heard something talking. Murmuring in the streets around us.

This was before I’d had the dream I mentioned earlier, otherwise I might have gone full panic mode. They weren’t really whispers, though. It sounded more like a recording of somebody speaking normally, but playing at a very low volume. I noticed it was coming from behind me, so I spun on my heels, reaching for Hope's hand and wrenching the flashlight within it toward the dark. There was nothing there, however.

It was around that time that she heard it too, “What… what is that?” She asked barely above a whisper.

I furrowed my brow in confusion, trying to decide if it’d be safer to run, or hold our ground for more clues. The sound was still so hard to make out; no words that came through clear enough for me to hear. There was a sudden sound, however, that was unmistakable. A laugh, sudden and loud, making me jump.

It wasn’t because it was scary, it was just the suddenness of it that had jarred me. In contrast, the chuckle sounded genuine. Warm and filled with joy. It was also so loud and stark to everything else, that I finally pieced together where it was coming from.

My eyes fell toward the hollow body, crumpled in the cart.

Instantly, I grabbed Hope and tugged her back, breathing shallow so that I could hear more of the sound emanating from the corpse. Eventually, she did the same, both of us attempting to figure out what the hell was going on.

The body didn’t move, though. It didn’t sit up and start clambering toward us. It just continued to lay still while recordings echoed from its many holes.

“Is there something still in there,” Hope whispered, “There’s no way it’s still alive, right?”

Cautiously, I took a step closer, the other me still gripping my arm tightly, just in case. The laughing had stopped, and the noise was back to its original chatter, but in the silence, I could finally make out its sound.

“I love you,” I heard a feminine voice say with adoration dripping from her tone.

“I love you too,” a man said back.

Then music began to ring out at that same, low volume. It was something slow and romantic, wailing somberly into the streets. I continued to hear voices and shuffling in the background, but couldn’t discern what they were saying through the noise.

Shaking my head, I said, “Hope… I think the noise *is* the body.”

She rejoined me by the cart's side, “What the… how is it doing that?”

I shrugged, “I’m not sure.”

After a long beat of listening, the two of us indulging in more of the oddity, hope finally spoke again, softly and curiously.

“Imprints…”

Leaving us both to chew on what that meant, she gingerly grabbed the handle, then turned to me, “Should we, um…?”

I nodded, not peeling my eyes from the talking husk, “Yeah. Let’s go.”

The rest of the walk to the cliff door was a little more somber, the both of us carrying more than  just the weight of the body. Hope was probably right; more imprints had ‘appeared’ since that note was made. The problem was that imprints were bodies, and if more bodies appeared, than that meant they were probably just poor, innocent souls that stumbled into this place like us. People who got lost here and never found the towers refuge in time…

There was more weight than that, though. The term ‘imprint’ combined with the noise from the corpse told a chilling story. Something about this place was taking part of people with them when they died. Hell, the fact that it was a lovely town in the real world, but a dead, decaying place on the other side made me wonder if it was making imprints of more than just ‘organic’ things.

Obviously the people here were fascinated by the concept as well, and thought it could lead to… well, *something.* That part I’m still trying to figure out.

I can’t help but think about the end of Juarez’s note, though.

*‘I swear I didn’t know what we were doing here… Shae lied to us… I can’t live with myself…’*

I really hope that the extent of that was these bodies, and there isn’t more horrific secrets waiting around the bend.

Hope and I finally reached the hatch, then looked at each other before creaking it open. The pungent smell of death began wafting up from its depths, and my stomach did somersaults as I finally had to confront what we were about to do.

Hope could see it on my face, “Are… you okay with this?” she asked.

I swallowed and eyed the body, “Like you said earlier. What other choice do we have?”

Hope nodded, then together, we grabbed each side of the body and lifted it out.

It was a bit of a struggle to untangle the thing from the cart, then get it hoisted onto the lip of the hatch door. Once it was up, the two of us listened to its somber melodies one last time before giving it a final shove, sending it tumbling into the dark below.

*Thunk thud thump!*

Down it went, deep into the depths, bouncing off the unforgiving shaft walls all the way. Hope and I waited one minute, then two, our eyes locked on each other as we listened. Nothing seemed to be happening at first, but after a beat of silence, a noise returned up the shaft.

A low, ominous rumble. Large metallic parts whirling and clanging deep below.

We listened carefully for around 3 minutes until it finally stopped, and then, the air went back to its quiet, unliving drone.

I stepped back and took it all in, wondering if I’d missed something, but no. nothing about the door, nor the hatch had changed or shifted in anyway. Well, almost none of it.

I zeroed in on the small gauge to the side of the hatch marked by the amber LED’s, noticing that it was now different. Where as one row had been lit up before, there was now two. That might have been encouraging, knowing that we’d actually just made something happen, but the issue was that there were still hundreds of tiny bars still dark. The gauge was massive, and we’d just put a drop into a very large bucket.

Withdrawing the copy of the map I’d made from my pocket, I began counting the dots, my heart sinking the closer I got to the end. There were more on the screen back at the station that I couldn’t fit, but even factoring in an extra couple dozen, there was no way we were even close to filling the meter. Not if it was only enough to fill one bar at a time.

On top of that, even if we filled it, there was no guarantee that it would even do anything. The note said that it could power something to get us home, but *we* didn’t know how to operate it, and besides, we still needed the code to the door to even get inside. Once again, the tide of hope in my heart began to recede.

It’s a good thing my clone had picked a fitting name.

“That’s okay,” she nodded confidently, looking at the meter, “We still got a bunch more to go. Who knows, maybe some of them will have more, um… ‘juice’ than others.”

I shook my head, “Hope, what do we even do once we fill it?”

“I don’t know, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there. It’s better than just sitting around and waiting to become and imprint ourselves, right?” she smiled.

I looked to the side with a frown, unsure about everything.

Her smile began to melt and match mine, “Look, I know the odds are that we die here. I’m being optimistic, but I’m not naïve. But we can’t just give up. Not when Trevor and Dad are still waiting for us back home. We can’t leave Dad alone—not after mom—and we can’t die with the last thing we said to Trevor being… well, you know.”

Her words stung my heart to hear, guilt bubbling up into my chest, but she still had a point. I had amends to make back home, and the only thing that scared me more than the creatures out here was dying without getting to see my family one last time.

Looking back, I couldn’t believe I had started my road trip in the first place with that very idea in mind…

I looked to hope and nodded, returning her soft smile, “Right. Let’s head back to the station and get a solid plan laid out. We don’t want to be in the streets when something shows up again, and we’ve already been out here a while.”

She nodded in affirmation.

I couldn’t help but laugh and shake my head as she pulled her coat farther onto her shoulders.

“What?” she asked, cocking her head in confusion.

“Nothing,” I told her, “I just don’t think I’m ever going to get used to talking to myself.”

“Oh, whatever,” she giggled back, “We talked to ourselves all the time. The only difference now is that we don’t have to look in a mirror to do it.”

We decided to bring the cart back to the station with us for future use, but agreed that we might need to make some modifications or find something else in the future. That body had been light as it was… well… *empty.* But future ones were going to be harder to haul, and trying to get them in and out of the cart was not easy. Plus, the thing was loud as hell, and we worried that it might attract much unwanted attention from below.

We were in the middle of discussing this when Hope suddenly trailed off, looking toward the north side of the plateau in confusion. I turned to check the tower for the fifth time in the last minute, but the light was still off, so that wasn’t her concern.

“What’s up?” I asked in a whisper.

“Was it always that bright over there?” She asked.

I looked off toward where she was directing and saw clearly what she meant. Over the buildings and houses, there was a large swath of the abyssal sky that was being scared off by copious amounts of light. Considering this place had been pitch black aside from the door and the tower, I could confidently say that it was new.

My heart started back to its new favorite rhythm.

We were close to the station, so we continued on until we reached the front door, then left the cart before cautiously starting toward main street. Based on where the lights were coming from, we should have been able to see their source down the road.

“Do you think this is a trap?” Hope asked.

“Maybe,” I told her, “Let’s just keep a safe distance.”

Sure enough, looking down the street, right next to the spot where the road abruptly dropped into the sea, I could see streetlights to an empty parking lot casting their beams onto the asphalt below. The weird thing was that even though I hadn’t spent much time over there, I was almost certain that there hadn’t been a parking lot. There had been a small business building, and the lights were definitely not on.

Slowly, like moths drawn to flame, we kept creeping down the road, our curiosity getting the better of us. It wasn’t until we were right next to the motel that we could get a full view of the place, and what we saw made my blood run cold.

“Oh my God…” Hope gasped breathlessly, “Is that—”

“Yeah…” I muttered, dread pressing onto me like an ocean.

A large parking lot filled with streetlights lay ahead with a massive building behind it. The structure was plain; mostly composed of grey painted bricks, but there were several neon tubes of light comprising a rainbow that ran the top perimeter of it. A sign near the double front doors said the name of the building, but it paled compared to the more extravagant one by the street.

A colorful cartoon zebra smiled out at us, arms stretched in welcome, backlit by searing, florescent lights. Beneath him in colorful, bubbly letters were the words, ‘*Zane’s Jammin’ Jungle’.*

The location that Hope and I had a birthday when we were 7.

“Why is that here?” She asked me, panic under her words, “H-Has that always been—”

“No.” I answered sharply, my heart pounding.

We stared, positively transfixed by the building for a long time before I felt Hope grab my wrist, “Well, whatever it is, it can’t be good. Come on, let’s get back to the tower.”

I resisted for the slightest moment, feeling inexplicably drawn to the place. I wanted to know why a random building from my youth was suddenly dropped into this horrible town. A place that was so far from my childhood innocence that it looped back around to being downright sinister seeing it perched on the edge of the abyss. I knew Hope was right, though. Nothing good could come of it, and charging in blind without a plan wasn’t going to end well.

Together, we made for the station.

And that’s where we’ve been since. We’ve gone out for a few more bodies, but like the first, they don’t do much to fill the meter. They all sing and talk; all in different voices and songs. All of them just as mutilated as the last. We’re not sure what we’re achieving, but we haven’t really found any other clues to set us on another path.

Well, I suppose that’s not true. We found one.

Upon checking the map once more for dots, one of the rig statuses had changed. The one on the north side of town. The north side, right where Zane’s has appeared.

It now reads, *‘Cell Ready For Harvest; Malfunction detected’.*

Hope thinks we should ignore it, and I agree, but I think both of us know deep down that we’re not going to get anywhere else with this if we don’t eventually venture in there. Why else would something so prominently related to us appear out of thin air? This place is clearly all about imprints of the past, and if my past has started getting stitched into this hellscape of a town, then there must be answers there.

We also know that whatever is waiting there for us can’t be good, however, and I think that’s what scares us…

Juarez wasn’t lying about damages to the equipment, and I suspect that might be what’s causing the signal interference. There’s a lot of cables ripped to pieces or servers that looks smashed. I’ll be the first to tell you that I know nothing about computers, but I found a closet full of spare chords and parts, and I’m going to attempt to swap a few out in my free time. I don’t know if it’ll help with anything, but at this point, I’m dying for outside contact.

I guess more accurately, now more than ever, I need advice on what I should do. There’s gotta be puzzle pieces here that I’m not seeing, and I’m terrified that I might make a wrong step and get my selves killed. Here’s to hoping I can get it figure out…

I’ll update you when I have more, but for now, thank you all for following along. It gives me more comfort than you can imagine to know that we're not entirely alone in all this, and that if we die, we aren't going to die unknown.

Be back soon.
