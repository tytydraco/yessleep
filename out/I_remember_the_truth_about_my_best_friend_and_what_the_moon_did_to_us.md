If there's one lesson I've taken from my tortured and broken life, it's that you should never go out during the full moon. 

You see throughout history, those who knew about the moon, have warned us about what it's does to humans. Both the innocent and the vilest people of the human race could not be saved from its affects. Some cultures would claim that the moon brought out the darkness in people, others claimed that people would go missing and never be found during a full moon. However the most compelling theory was that the full moon could turn people into beasts that killed every thing they came into contact with, that of course began the legend of the Werewolf. 

Later in my life I would learn all that all these legends were technically true, just not in the way we thought they were. The reality of the situation is that they were just cautionary tales to keep us from going out at the wrong time and turning into the monsters that we were never meant to be.

While you may think that the moon is at its fullest once every thirty days. It is in fact only at its fullest when the night of the equinox coincides within the night of a full moon. Only on that day, the longest day of the year, does the moon rise to its full potential.

In 1990 my family and I lived on a small farm in one of the most rural parts of Durban, South Africa. On the farm I would spend my days in simplicity, going to school, coming home, doing my chores and watching television. While doing my chores I learnt about the moon and how it's affects animals. Dogs, cats, cows and many other types of animals have their moods, reproductive cycles and many other parts of their life affected by the moon. Almost as if there picking up signals from it.

That off course didn't interest me much at the time, what did interest me is that I had just turned thirteen and was starting to develop a crush on the girl next door. In the most literal sense.

I had grown up next to Alice, knowing her since we were around three years old. In our youngest years we rode our bikes around the neighborhood, and discovered everything we could about our small town, from the forest to the lake. We knew that if you took the wrong route while in the forest you could be lost or if you took even one step into the lake, you would drown. However for us there was nothing to fear because in all the years we spent around our town, we had become experts.

So the night that Alice showed up at my window, way past my bedtime, and suggested we sneak out into the woods to find a party that some teenagers were having, I was in. There was really nothing else to do, I had tried watching the 11 PM showing off Van Helsing but being so far away from most television towers, the signals were crossing in a strange way. It was showing me a mix of Van Helsing fighting werewolves and some sappy love story, with the images of each ghosting into the other.

Besides we were completely safe, there was nothing about the town that we didn't know and we were technically teenagers anyway.  So I jumped my window and the two of us made our way into the forest. 

After about ten minutes of walking we stopped for a rest, Alice's hair glowed in the moonlight and it created an unforgettable aura around her. I had never been more in love with her in my life. Taken by the intense feelings that I had at the moment, things I had never felt before, I resolved to tell her I loved her after we found the party. However we would never find that party.

The next few minutes happened quickly and I only remember flashes of it. There was a beast, I was incredibly scared, there was so much blood and finally there was nothing. They found me the next morning and according to my parents for the first few days I was so traumatized that I could only say one word.

Werewolf.

They never found Alice, over the next few years I recovered and moved out of my hometown. However I never let the images of the beast leave my head, I never let the idea of the Werewolf leave me in peace. I put everything I was and every thing I had into my obsession of finding them. I went to every town looking for signs of them and studied the legends as deeply as I could. However I found nothing. 

The legend of the Werewolf was splintered and changed over and over again, with every culture having a different idea of them. From Skin walkers to shape shifters to lycanthrope, No one could agree on what they were. Only when they became a part of popular culture did people start agreeing on what they looked like and their characteristics. 

During my searches I would occasionally go back to my home town, walk through the woods and sit at the edge of the lake, to our favorite spot, dipping my feet into the water. The soft grass below me caressing my feet as I remembered the good times I had with Alice before she disappeared. 

By the time I was forty years old I decided that this search had taken up too much of my life, I had a wife and two children and the past wasn't worth losing the present over. So I resolved to take one more walk through the woods before letting it all go. However what I didn't know at the time is I had returned on an equinox, the same as the night Alice and I snuck out.

The signals reconnected and I remembered everything. 

That night in the woods, Alice and I were almost at the party when she started to feel sick. However it wasn't a normal sick. Instead her bones and skin started to move. I wanted to scream but I was paralyzed as she went from human to beast. She was a werewolf.

When she completed the transition she stood at over three times my size with her face the same as a dog and her eyes deep red. As much as I wanted to help her I had seen this scene in movies many times and I knew she would kill me. So I ran and ran and ran, however it didn't matter how far I ran, she followed me.

When she did finally find me she charged at me, but she didn't bite me, she grabbed onto my shoulders and shook me. I screamed as loud as I could thinking I was gonna die. However I didn't because my screams affected her in some way. She let go off me and slowly backed away.

This was my chance, if I didn't do some thing would be killed by her, so I picked up a rock, ran towards her and attacked first. For a beast so large she went down surprisingly easy but it was only the beginning. I had to keep her down, so I attacks over and over again until the werewolf stopped moving. 

I knew Alice was in there, but I also knew I would never see her again. If what I had learnt from movies were true than she would heal very quickly.    So I had to get rid of her once and for all, or the entire town would be in danger, not to mention the teenagers who were having a party close by.

I don't know how I did it but I dragged the wolf all the way to the lake, found a large boulder and ripped my shirt into pieces to make a rope. I than tied her legs to the boulder using the makeshift rope and sunk her into our favorite spot. 

I awoke the next morning in the woods finally knowing the truth about that night. I sat in the place I had awoken in for what must have been an hour before I made up my mind of what to do. 

Yes Alice had turned into a monster but she didn't deserve to die that young. So I resolved to retrieve her body. It wouldn't be hard to find her, even though it I was sick to my stomach. The lake was so deep that there was no reef or plants growing close to the surface. I had learnt that when I was young and I guess I never unlearnt it, but the trauma made me forget. It gave me chills to think that all these years I had been feeling her hair below me.

So I returned to our spot, swam to the bottom and untied her feet. Letting her body swim to the surface so I could give her a proper burial, but what I found made me throw up.

There was no monster, or beast. Not the remnants of a werewolf corpse. Instead it was Alice, the icy cold water perfectly preserving her body, and the the place where I had used the rock on her. I let her slowly sink back to the bottom, because I couldn't quite understand anything. 

It's been a while since that day I put together as much of the puzzle as I could. From what I can understand, the moon is like a satellite that sends signals. Sometimes it signals can change the weather and the tides, other times it can affect animals. However if you are in the wrong place at the wrong time, those signals can affect humans and cross with radio waves from something nearby.
