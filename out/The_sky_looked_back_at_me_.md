Listen carefully. If you’re out there with your telescope, if you’re gazing at the stars and thinking the universe is full of beauty and mystery—stop. Just stop. The stars aren’t what you think they are. The night sky isn’t empty. It’s watching you. It’s waiting. And if you see it—if you see what I saw—there’s no going back.

This isn’t poetic. This isn’t philosophical. This is a warning from someone who stared too long and saw something I was never meant to see. I need you to understand: this isn’t curiosity. This isn’t wonder. It’s hunger. And if you keep looking, it will find you.

It was December of last year. The air was crisp, the sky cloudless, and the stars shone like diamonds against the black velvet of space. I began by aligning the equatorial mount, ensuring the telescope’s axis was parallel to Earth’s rotation. The declination lock clicked softly as I adjusted the tube toward my target. A little to the left. A bit to the right. Then, just a touch more to the left. 

Satisfied, I nudged the right ascension ever so slightly eastward and leaned into the eyepiece. That’s when I saw it—Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, staring back at me like a cruel, unblinking eye. My lips curled into a smile, I thought I'd never get tired of it's beauty.

“Still as magnificent as the first time, aren't you?” I whispered, as if the gas giant could hear me. Over the years, it had become my silent companion, a familiar face in endlessly lonely nights. Sad as it may be, it felt like I was looking at the gaze of an old friend.

An urge gripped me so subtlety, I'd have sworn I was in control. My hands moved automatically, adjusting knobs to sharpen the image of the swirling crimson storm. The gears protested, a subtle whine that shouldn't have been there. I frowned; I took meticulous care of my equipment. Ignoring the anomaly, I reached for my battered notebook, eager to transcribe my observations.

The night air shifted, carrying a biting chill from the sea and a strange, acrid scent of ozone. I froze as the breeze became an unnatural biting gale, the cogs of the telescope spinning against my adjustments. A low hum resonated beneath my feet, a vibration that rattled through my bones.

Peering back into the lens, my heart stopped. My telescope became my window into  a night that was no longer empty. The Great Red Spot pulsated, swirling with a sentience that defied explanation. Shadows writhed at the edges of my vision, growing closer with every blink.

"Dear God," I gasped. "What are you showing me?"

The crimson vortex seemed to breathe, its gaze piercing through the nothingness between us. My chest tightened as if an invisible hand had clenched around my lungs. The air grew colder, heavier, pressing down on me with a crushing weight. I tried to pull away, but my body refused to move. My veins felt as though they were constricting, a suffocating pressure that left me gasping.

A whisper echoed in my mind—not my own, yet it spoke in my voice. "Understand. Witness."

The telescope's lens became a portal, dragging me into an endless void. There was no floor, no ceiling, no walls—just a vast, black stretching infinitely in all directions. The red eye swelled before me, bleeding light into the abyss. I was helpless, weightless, and utterly alone.

The hum grew deafening, drowning out my thoughts. Images burned into my mind: cities reduced to ash, oceans devouring continents, shadows writhing in agony. I saw humanity torn apart, twisted into grotesque forms by an insidious force. Flames consumed everything. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think.

"Dear God! OH GOD!" I thought I screamed, but the silence devoured my voice.

The eye’s gaze bored into me, filling my soul with a terror I couldn’t contain. My body shook, tears streaming as I clawed at what must have been the ground, desperate for release. And then, the whispers turned cruel. They begged and screamed in my voice, pleading with me to act—to do something. Each cry was laced with venom, urging me toward unspeakable acts.

"I'm just a witness!" I choked out, clutching at the cold grass beneath me as reality snapped back into place. The telescope stood motionless, the storm gone. The whispers lingered.

Even now, as I sit here writing this, the red eye haunts me. Its gaze burns behind my eyelids, its whispers louder in the silence. I no longer look at the stars for solace. They stare back, their cold indifference replaced with something darker, something cruel.

I don’t know how long I can endure the temptation. The shadows are still here, just out of sight, waiting for me to falter. I hear them now, clawing at the edges of my mind, begging to be let in.

If you feel the cosmos pulling your gaze skyward, know that not all who watch are alone. Some things were never meant to be witnessed. And if the heavens speak to you—run. Don’t look back.

Please, just don’t look back.
