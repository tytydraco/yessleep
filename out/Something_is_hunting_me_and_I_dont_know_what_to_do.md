It's been hunting me. It's crossed running water. It's been in churchyards. I've seen it in the middle of cities and deep in the mountains. It's hunted me in Cymru. It's hunted me in the West. It's always the same. I don't know how I know, but I do. It's always the same thing. Its claws clack on cobble the same in Cymru or Chester or Bristol. Its eyes are a deep, bloody, fiery red, in the Cambrians and in the Mendips. I heard the same snap and snarl in my university accommodation as I did at my friends house in the Forest. Saw the same black mat of fur as I climbed Crib Goch as I do outside my house now, as I write.

I saw it first in my nightmares. 14, maybe 15 years ago, I wouldn't sleep for days. I wans't much more than a toddler. I saw something in my mind, like nightmares but worse. That great black beast. Teeth, as white as snow, sharp as razors, long as my (then rather small) hands, wrist to finger tips. And it's eyes, they were the worst. It was as if they were ablaze; doors to hell, great and small and cavernous and gleaming, filled with malice and hatred and wicked cunning, and devoid of soul and thought and rationality. I looked into those eyes and knew, in my soul, it wanted to kill me. It wanted to sink those gleaming white teeth into my body and rip me asunder, rend me from this world and into the next, but more. Worse. It wanted to devour me, soul and skin and all. I couldn't bear it. In my child's brain, I knew I had to do something. So I did. Night by night, I fought back. I killed it, over and over. Hour after hour. Eventually, it stopped returning. It left damage. Almost every night, I would lucid dream. I couldn't help myself. It wasn't a conscious decision. I could never sleep normally again. At first it was security; now, it's habit. If only dealing with it today was so easy. It would return occasionally. Not often, maybe once a year or so. It'd look, maybe attack me. It was never cause for concern. Until now.

It's been about nine months. A bit less, maybe. At first, I thought I was going mad. I took a train back to university. Somewhere, between Cheltenham and Birmingham, where the phone signal drops dead, and the hills and fields roll far and away with nought upon them, I saw it. Off in the distance. Nothing of note, I thought. But as my eyes flitted over the fields, and I saw the black mass off in the distance, a fell chill ran down my spine. Something felt deeply, deeply wrong with it. It could have been anything; a cow, a horse. A shadow from a tree, or an old shed. But my gut twisted in knots; my clothes felt wrong on my body, all of a sudden too tight, too loose, far too heavy and as if they weren't there at all. I saw in my mind the hellish eyes, glaring down at me once more. I turned back to my book. It wasn't real. It was a horse. Or a cow. Or the physical manifestation of the thing that tortured me oh so many years ago.

When I got to university, it was exam season, and I had an unrelated mental health crisis. I stopped leaving the house, unless prompted by others. This fact probably saved my life. When I wasn't wasting away in my bed, or trying to alienate myself from my friends, or burning time on my computer, I'd occasionally look out of my bedroom, or from the kitchen windows. I didn't see anything at first. But at closer inspection, what was that up on the hill? What was the red flash in the night? I thought I was going mad. As I got hungrier, and spoke less, I started seeing more. Hearing more. A rough bark. A howl in the night. Two burning red eyes, staring at me as I lay rotting in bed. Then, on one fateful night, I heard something else. It was on my roof. I heard it scratch and claw, heard it click clack with its talon-like feet upon the shingles of the roof. I didn't sleep that night.

It was downhill from there. I saw it almost every day after that. I walked quickly, waiting for it to pounce upon me as I travelled for my classes - the only reason I'd leave the house, most days. I'd see it in the woods on the walk up, or off on the hills outside of town. I knew it was looking at me. It knew I was looking at it. I travelled with friends almost exclusively.

There was one day I came home late, having stayed on campus for a meeting about my dissertation. It was a frosty February evening, and the sun was slipping below the horizon, its golden rays blazing off the sea. I'd been getting sicker and sicker, feeling lost and dizzy and confused. I stopped to rest on a bench, catching my breath. To my side, down the road, the most curious of noises came. A click. Clack. Click. Clack. As it slowly, slowly, paced towards me. Its teeth, sharp and long and white, gleaming in the golden sun, dripped with desire and hunger.

My feet carried me home faster than I thought was possible, my long blue coat flying in the wind. My fob opened the door, and I managed to slam it shut as the beast snarled outside. I could see it pace for a moment, before it slinked off, a growl rolling from its mouth that sounded like a chuckle. That was the closest it’s ever gotten. 

It follows me everywhere. I went hiking with friends, and I saw it up the valley, sat in a field of sheep. They huddled away from it in terror, the poor things. When we came by, it had left, and the sheep seemed fewer in number. A few trees on the path were shredded, with great gnashes torn into the wood. My friends thought little of it; I knew better.

Initially, I thought it was only me that could see it. That I was going mad, that it was some weird hallucination. In April, before I left for Easter, a man was found dead up in the fields near town, a clear victim of this wolf-dog. Obviously, I didn’t see his corpse, but the way it was described? Why would I need to? He was torn to shreds, apparently, his bones crushed, his flesh rendered. Of course, nothing could have done this. The largest predator in Britain is the badger. I know better of course. I saw it that night, licking the offal and gore off its chops as it smiled down upon me from its regular perch.

My next serious encounter with it was 24 hours around handing in my dissertation. That night, I dreamed again, content that I would be in control. I wasn’t. Normally, I have some level of control; I can be in a castle, or a library, with friends, or alone, or anything else really. When I came to in my dream, I was stood on a mirror-like surface, rippling under my feet. The sky was a deep blood red, and in the centre of my view was that beast.

“Why?” I shouted at it, desperate for an answer. My hands formed fists, ready to defend myself against it, create some dream-weapon, put up that same resistance I always had. The beast sat on its hind legs, glaring at me. It bobbed its head like a hyena, snickering that same laughing growl it did after it almost caught me. I took a step, two, five, ten - but I didn’t get any closer. The beast stood up then and howled, and I was jolted awake. I saw it out the window, in that same pose it was in the dream, in the same pose it always was. It slinked away.

That night, after turning in the dissertation, I (and it seemed half the nation) had decided to go out. It was a mistake, of sorts. I realised as I cut through the churchyard, a route I’d taken a hundred times to get from one club to another, that it was following me. If I didn’t know any better - the seemingly inherent evil, the mauled man, etc - I’d have begun thinking it was some wayward stray the size of a pony. I hurried back into town, chased by the click-clack of its claws and its horrid, barking laugh. It knew that I’d be walking home alone that night, having gone out on my own, meeting up with friends I didn’t live with. It watched as I sat outside the bar, talking for an hour, from behind a bin. It watched as I left with friends in tow. And somehow, just somehow, we gave it the slip. I sat in my friend’s house, and prayed when I opened her front door, I’d be safe.

I was. I opened it, gave the obligatory goodbye kisses and hugs, and ran home. I’d chosen my outfit well; running shoes instead of heels, the skirt of my dress loose enough to run in comfortably. I flew as if I was being chased by a wolf. I wasn’t, for once, though the past few months had made it more likely than not. As I entered my block of flats, I glanced up at its regular spot, and met its eyes. It stared down at me in fury, realising it had missed its best chance.

I couldn’t leave soon enough after that. It seemed to leave me alone, to an extent. It would watch me occasionally; a few sheep went missing. But after that missed chance, I thought I’d won. But I hadn’t. I’ve seen it through this past summer. When I visit my friends' houses, outside of mine; we even took a day trip, far out into the mountains of Cymru, and I saw it there, across the valley. Watching. Waiting. 

I don’t know what it wants. I don’t know why it’s tormenting me. Perhaps it relishes my fear? Perhaps it’s upset that I resisted the nightmares, oh so many years ago? I don’t know. I just want it to end. Have it eat me. Rip me to pieces. Or, better, have it leave me alone.

I just. I don't know. I don't know what I want; or what to do. Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips?
