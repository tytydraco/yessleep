Outside the apartment, street lamps oozed hazy yellow light into the puddles on Broadway and 32nd and I scampered to hide twelve dirt-splotched photo IDs as the headlights of a black Chevy Malibu streaked across bare walls. 

Drake, my boyfriend, had been at work. His shifts were 24 on, 48 off and my time had been spent working on case studies while his included late night 911 dispatching for the tummy aches and the Karens attempting to smother grease fires with water. 

In that time, I had chosen to come home early to make myself look a bit more presentable. And to cook dinner. Or to make Costco’s concoctions seem more of a Martha-Stewart-meets-unskilled-girlfriend-trying-to-impress-hot-Greek-boyfriend style meal.

In that time, I had clumsily sliced my thumb open while opening a bottle of wine, which was why I was rooting around for a first aid kit before Drake returned, and why I was opening drawers with enough force to cause the rollers to fly off the tracks.

I should have been disgusted with what lied there. I know this. I should have seen that plastic bag in the bottom of the false drawer rife with keychains, square wallets, faded print and vacuous eyes and I should have taken the contents straight to the police. I should have cried, quavered in fear, felt the realization strike me like a defibrillator, slipped out the back door and left. 

I should have cracked like any normal person would with the evidence clear as ones reflection in a glassy lake.

But I didn’t. I couldn’t. Which is why, instead, I found myself replacing the veneer of wood, falling back from the counter, straightening my legs and glancing sidelong in the mirror.

I was cold and pale looking, a porcelain doll in an antique store. I observed the dress I had donned—now bloodied and ruined; the grimy touch of lost items lingered like a mold in my palm. 

That was when the door sluiced in the distance. 

I knew what I was going to do: I would pretend the past three minutes had been a nightmare and continue the night as planned. I would lie to him like I had done many times before, and to do that, I would have believe the lie myself.

I would play the game. Be oblivious. Clueless.

The perfect girlfriend.

Drake moved inside moments later, sliding off his shoes at the door and making his way to the kitchen before twisting his hands around my waist and kissing my temple. 

“What’s this?” He asked. My spine straightened, going rigid underneath his touch as a calloused finger traced the line of dried blood on my forearm.

“Nothing.” I shrugged, and his grip loosened. He removed his arms from where he had nestled them and shifted to a barstool to regard me curiously. 

“There’s gauze in my truck.”

“I’m fine.”  

He sighed, watching me saw the sourdough. 

“Any real-life fires today?” I knew he wanted to talk about his day, and despite my voice being a painful attempt at a joke, Drake grinned back at me. 

“Candle explosion. Space heater. Four times a false alarm at that rental property on Crowley.” 

I nodded. Nothing new. 

“There was another drowning.” His voice was languid, matter of fact, telling the weather.

My hand buffered while sawing before resuming the steady rhythm. I looked up at him briefly.

“Again?” I asked, the perfect amount intrigue bolstered by the expectant naivety in my tone.

“Recovered the body this morning. Male. Probably mid twenties.”

Prudently mortified—that could have described the face I was making. *Play it cool.*

He went on, “Weird thing was, he was a swimmer. D1 at Stanford. Makes it all seem a bit… fishy.” 

He was absolutely right it was fishy. It was repulsive. Uncanny and—

“Hey.” Drake’s voice reached out to hook my consciousness, pulling me back to the room. “You okay?”

*Fine. Just trying to swallow a twelve pound frog.*

“Are they investigating?” I asked. It was all too much, and I found myself flicking through memories like cards in a deck. Sorting and shuffling the details I knew I would need to censor. I was having to force the air into my lungs once I convinced myself he could see through me. *He knows. He’s got to know.*

No, I was being irrational. 

“FBI was there pretty much immediately. They have a few suspects in mind already. Talked to Adam between testimonies and he thinks it’s  connected to the cases from Reno about—“

“Time of death?”

“Two days ago, they think. But I don’t know how they can tell that kind of stuff.”

“Rigor mortis, algor mortis, organs, blood congealing.” I elucidated, pouring red wine into two stem glasses.

“It’s very strange how much you know about dead bodies.” Drake reached out for the wine glass, immediately taking a sip and slowly savoring the liquid with playfully wary eyes.

“I don’t know anymore than the average crime podcast listener, which for the record are sometimes more efficient at solving the cases than the FBI.”

*And the time of death was during the exact same time you were on a run before coming home to shower and meet me to see the new Nosferatu film.*  

“You’re going to knock that glass over.” I pretended not to hear him.

*He had run into the victim at the bar and charmed her, lured her out to the lake, probably to skinny dip or something pervious along the lines.*

“Abby.” 

“Hm?” 

I had resumed sawing bread and stopped my furious slicing to watch the nearby wine glass slide to the floor and shatter.

“Shit. I’m sorry, I—“

My movements were meticulous and swift as I reached for the broom and dustpan. As if I had planned for the mess to happen, the tools were readily looming in the corner of the room.

It should have been obvious what his next question would be, and yet I found myself slightly taken aback, struggling—for the first time in years—to tell a convincing lie. 

“Can you tell me why there’s blood on your dress?” His eyes were calm, caring. But still held an inch of unnerving scrutiny. I continued sweeping.

“It was there when I got here,” he said, his eyebrow arching intently, “and it looks more serious than a little garlic mincing mishap.”

“I cut my thumb opening the wine.”

*It is how it happened. That kind of thing happens all the time.*

“I’ve been very clumsy tonight, obviously.”

“Where were you before I got home?”

“Drake, what’s with the interrogation?” My grip on the broom tightened and I stopped sweeping to watch his eyes flick to where my knuckles had gone white. “I went shopping and then came here to make you dinner.”

“You’re just.. a little on edge.” His face when soft as he analyzed my annoyance.  

I took a deep breath, “No, no.” I exhaled slowly, “I’m sorry.” I had to get a grip, settle myself before the act became something I could no longer keep up. I was a music box wound up, the ballerina twirling her last pirouette as I said, “Please, tell me more about your day.”

As Drake spoke, I feigned interest.

“Jack got a promotion and the guys had a flour battle. Full-out war zone at the station.”

I nodded, silently cobbling the story together. My eyes stayed wide with rapture, feigning focus while drawing the map of him with him in it.

“I was thinking we head out to the lake house next week? Take the pontoon? I can ask off a few days.” The Abby he expected smiled, but I was imagining what it would be like if I had not gone to the authorities and presented my case. If I had not cracked the case myself, before the FBI had even wandered down the right track. 

I knew how I was going to survive. 

It was Drake that killed those men. Drake that drowned innocent victims. Drake that had been off duty each time a time of death had been decided. Drake was the one that had lured those men, threatened to do the same to me. My boyfriend was the killer, and I was the one that got away. I can’t believe it took me so long to figure it out.
