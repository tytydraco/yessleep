*The use of phones or digital communication devices is prohibited.* 

*Do not use your phone for calling, texting, navigation, music, or any purpose. In cases of emergency, contact dispatch via your handheld radio.*

*We recommend leaving your phone at home. If you choose to bring your device, power it off before entry onto Route 333. If you forget to power off your device, do NOT do so once en route; this would still qualify as phone-utilization. The offender would still be subject to punishment as the road deems fit.*

*Digital non-communication devices are permitted.*

“What’s in the trailer?”

Through the radio, Randall sighed. In case anybody is unfamiliar with the mechanics of the handheld radio, you have to actually be pushing the transmit button for your voice to go through. Which meant Randall was being a passive aggressive cry-baby who intentionally *decided* for me to hear his sigh of annoyance. 

Sometimes, managers are just the worst.

I stood just outside my truck where I'd pulled over on the side of the highway to check my vehicle for damage. For those who don't remember from my last post, the things in the forest attacked me to try and get whatever was in the trailer. It was still dark outside.

“We literally *just* had this conversation,” he said. “Like three hours ago.”

“That was before I heard something inside the cargo. You tell me what’s in there right now, or I turn around and come back.”

“That eager to visit the forest again, huh?”

“Hang on,” I said. “How do you know about my encounter?”

The other end of the radio fell silent.

“You set me up!” I said. “You *knew* they were going to go after me with this thing in the trunk. You were trying to kill me off!”

“Don’t be irrational. That’s not what happened. You―”

“Don’t lie to me!” I screamed―then immediately realized he couldn’t hear me, because, *oh right, these are still radios.* One at a time. Pushing my transmit button while he was pushing his was just preventing me from hearing him. Which made me even more angry and *how dare the radio betray me too!* Which only proved that *yes.* I indeed *was* being irrational, even if it was justified.

I calmed and lifted my finger.

“―safe as long as you followed the rules,” he continued, oblivious to my outburst. “You did follow the rules, right? What am I saying, you’re alive, so of course you did. Look, road dwellers just get more excited when there’s live cargo. That’s all. As long as you’re cautious the rest of the trip, you’ll be fine.”

“But you knew I could die.”

“We would never put you in real danger. I’m not worried for your safety, Brendon. You shouldn’t be either.”

*I wasn’t,* I realized. Sure, in the moment I felt fear just like anybody else, but afterwards, in the calm, I was never worried for my safety. It didn’t matter what happened to me. My fury was less about the prospect of dying and more about the injustice of being set up.

“Something’s crying in it,” I said. “It sounds like a little girl.”

“Well, it isn’t.”

“Then tell me what it is.”

“Stop asking. You know that isn’t something I'll do. You haven't slept yet Brendon. I haven’t either. Go put your head on a pillow, and let’s talk when we’re both more calm, yeah?”

I told him exactly where he could stick his head.

“You aren’t as valuable as you think,” he growled at me. “If you continue in such an unprofessional manner, we really will find a replacement.”

I suspected I was exactly as valuable as I thought I was. Who else would take this job? Who else could drive the highway as fast as me?

And *unprofessional?* That was rich coming from the guy who’d demanded I come in at one in the morning and shrugged off the suggestion that we help save the lives of his former employees. I was gearing up to explain all of this (you can bet in less-than-professional words) when a wave of fatigue hit me.

I really hadn't gotten any sleep. The sun would be up in a few hours, and my body was experiencing the adrenaline-exhausted version of a hangover.

“Fine,” I told Randall. “We argue when I wake.”

“You’ll feel better.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

He was right. After sleeping, I did feel better. And while that should have only annoyed me further, it was difficult to feel so since I now felt infuriatingly great.

So great, in fact, I didn’t radio Randall back. As much as I loathed him that morning, neither he nor anyone else at dispatch was ever going to answer my questions. That much was obvious even before he’d straight up admitted it. It was also obvious I wasn’t really going to go back until I’d unloaded my current haul, so what was the point?

Instead, I headed inside the truck stop to grab a cup of the only decent coffee on Route 333.

“You’re alright then,” Tiff told me in the mini-diner.

“Why wouldn’t I be?”

“The Faceless Man was prodding your rig for hours last night. I had a broom ready in case he tried to break anything. I’ve never seen him stay in one place like that.”

A chill crept through me. “I never saw him.”

“He wasn’t at the windows. He was at the back of the freight. Looked like he was trying to get inside.”

*They get more excited when there’s live cargo.* That’s what Randall had said.

I sipped at my coffee.

“Hey Tiff…” I started. How could I phrase this? “Have you ever figured out―have you ever wondered, um, what’s up with the other people on the road? The non-truckers, like the ones who work here? Like if they’re real or not?”

“*Um. Like.* I forget your generation uses so many filler words.” She considered my question. “There’s different types of real, I suppose. We’re one type. They’re another.”

A statement which, while sounding wise and sage, didn’t actually help me understand anything. Ah well.

Tiff packed me food for a few days, and I headed outside. Back at my rig, I slipped a pancake under the slit in the trailer door. Something snatched it from the inside.

“Can you hear me?” I whispered.

No response.

“Do you need help?”

Nothing except the near-imperceptible shudder of the back door. Almost as if something on the other side was pressing a hand to it. Waiting to see what I’d decide.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It was after about six hours of driving that I realized with dawning, crippling horror of my irreversible mistake.

I’d forgotten a battery pack.

Let me explain. As you all probably remember, it’s prohibited to use phones on Route 333, even if you’re not calling with them. Why exactly? Dunno. But it is, and I wasn’t about to break any rules unnecessarily. Instead, I’d gotten in the habit of downloading content onto my old iPod Nano, which apparently qualified as a different category (I checked with management. It’s fine as long as I leave it in airplane mode). I also brought a battery pack to recharge the iPod with, since the outlets in the trucks didn’t always work.

Such as my current truck.

Which meant―you guessed it―I was now stuck on a ten day drive without any podcasts, books, or self-chosen music. And while I did understand on a deeply personal level that there were indeed worse tragedies than ‘lack of entertainment,’ this did still qualify as a tragedy.

I’d stayed away from the radio before that point. A few of the stations were in fact dangerous―they’d put you in a trance or whisper secrets you wished you could unhear―but overall they were safe. The other truckers didn’t seem to fear them too much. Logically, I knew the radio was overall safe, but I’d still never been desperate enough to take the risk. 

Until my iPod died, that is.

I flipped past a few country stations. Not my thing. Soon, though, I discovered something odd: a K-pop channel. 

It had probably been a few years since I’d actually listened to a car radio, but I couldn’t ever remember Korean music playing on it. Especially not out in the middle of nowhere like this. And the song that was playing―I didn’t recognize it. 

I know K-pop. Stereotype me however you wish, but yes, I’m one of those white guys that watches anime, and watches K-dramas, and listens to Korean boy bands. K-pop Demon Hunter? Pretty good. This song though? Not a clue.

I listened for a while more. The channel was 96.2. That wasn’t one of the stations I’d been warned against, was it? None of the music that came on was stuff I’d heard. They sounded like the groups I listened to but songs I was positive didn’t exist. Eventually, some of them started repeating, not in a loop like a playlist, just in the way popular songs replay every hour on the radio. 

And you know what? I started getting into it.

Besides the pay, the perks of Route 333 had been few and far between, but this was one I could get used to. An entire playlist of music I loved that didn’t exist in the real world? Sign me up. Maybe next time I’d bring a tape recorder and post this stuff online. I even started singing along. Time flew by.

I didn’t notice the flashing blue and white lights until the sirens came on.

“Um Randall...”

Nobody responded.

The police car pulled in behind me. The lights flicked off.

“*Randall*,” I tried again.

“Sorry!” came a voice from the handheld radio. A woman. *Gloria*, I believed? I didn’t interact with her as much. “I was out of the room. Randall’s not actually―oh, he left a note. It says ‘*Tell Brendon I’m off shift. If he wants to continue arguing, tell him one of the following responses’*.” She pauses. “The rest is quite rude to be honest.”

“I’m not trying to argue,” I said. “I just got pulled over.”

“Do you have a flat?”

“No. As in a cop pulled me over.”

There was silence. The silence of a doctor deciding how to word that ‘*it’s terminal. There’s nothing I can do*.’ “How bad were you speeding?” Gloria asked. “That can make a big difference.”

“Not at all. I was on cruise. I’ve read that section in the employee handbook.”

“Wait, you haven’t read all the employee handbook yet?”

*Um.* “Look, the important thing is he pulled me over. What do I do?”

A car door slammed. The highway patrol officer approached.

“The reason makes a difference,” Gloria pushed. 

“Yeah, I get that, but I don’t know.” I paused. “My cargo. That’s got to be why. I’m the one on the long haul trip with the special cargo.”

A longer silence. “Let me call Randall.”

The radio went dead. A knock sounded on my door. My heartbeat pittered in my chest. The employee handbook was pretty clear about this particular subject: don’t get pulled over. Don’t speed or do anything that might draw the highway patrol, because there wasn’t much you could do once you had. 

*I didn’t do anything,* I assured myself. *This isn’t my fault. Not really.*

Then again, it wasn’t really Tiff’s fault she’d gotten lane-locked. 

“Sir,” a husky voice said from outside.

I held my breath, and popped the door.

He had a tag and a uniform. He rested a hand on his hip. The mustached man was just like every other officer that had ever pulled me over, save one singular difference: his head was bent entirely back.

It was as if somebody with impossible strength had grabbed his hair and yanked backwards and down. The neck was snapped and contorted. An empty tube jutted up from a break in the twisted skin, his throat. His entire face was upside down and he stood backwards to face me. 

“Um, hi,” I said.

“Do you mind telling me what’s in your trailer?”

“Funny story. Not actually sure.”

“Please remove yourself from the vehicle and open the back of the truck.”

“Sorry, why did you pull me over?”

The officer sighed as if to say *kids these days.* A puff of red mist spurted from his severed throat blowhole. “Sir, you are speaking to an officer of the law. I *will* be investigating your vehicle. You will extricate yourself this instant or face the full wrath of the law.” It was like a child pretending at the lines a real police might say.

That thought calmed me. Play-acting. *Fine*. Two could dance to this tune.

“Your warrant?” I asked. “As an officer of the law, you’re clearly well aware you need one to search private property.”

“Yes. That… that’s correct. I do know that. I’ll retrieve mine now.”

He walked backwards towards his stalling car― by which I mean he walked forwards, with his upside down eyes blinking at me.

“Hello!” I called into my handheld. “Could really use some advice right now?”

Nothing.

“If not, I’m planning to try and outrun him.”

“Brendon, do not try to out-drive highway patrol. I repeat, do NOT attempt a chase. You will lose.” Gloria’s voice came through strong and clear. *Finally*.

Before I could respond, she continued. “I spoke to Randall. He said―none of us love the idea―but he said if you really weren’t speeding, there is one thing you could try?”

“Yeah?” I said.

She sounded almost embarrassed as she explained. Randall had suggested a last ditch attempt at escape, something that had only worked a few times before: annoying the officer until he left. If I really had done nothing to get pulled over, the officer might give up if he got frustrated enough. As long as he had no legal grounds to detain me or worse―*ticket* me.

I didn’t bother asking what ticketing actually meant.

“Okay, and how am I supposed to *annoy* the officer?” In my side window, I could see the cop ruffling around in the passenger of his cruiser.

“Randall says―again we don’t like this, but it’s worked once before―you can try videotaping him with your phone. Cops hate that.”

The fear pulsing through me abated. The pounding distress settled. A cold understanding took over. “Hey Gloria,” I said. “Put Randall through to me.”

I imagined a disagreement. A small debate. Eventually, though, his voice came through muffled and tinny. She must be holding her phone to the handheld. “Brendon?” he said.

“Answer honestly this time. Did you know this haul might kill me?” 

“I did.”

“Is there a chance I survive if I use my phone?”

“As soon as the cop is gone, drive like there’s no tomorrow.”

“That wasn’t my question,” I said. “I asked if there’s a chance I survive.”

“There is.”

“And if I refuse this plan?” I asked.

“Don’t.” His voice was barely audible. “I’m sorry. I really am sorry we put you in this position, but you cannot let highway patrol get ahold of your cargo. None of the sentient road-dwellers can. That isn’t an option. Too much is at stake. This is bigger than you.”

I nodded. “If I risk breaking this rule, I have one condition. It isn't negotiable. It’s a yes or no. I will only do this if you agree, got that? It's that when I get back, you will explain to me what Route 333 is. You will tell me what I’m hauling and why it’s so important.” I took a breath without letting go of the transmit button. “No arguing. Yes or no?”

A pause.

“Yes.”

There was a knock on the door. The officer was back. I set the radio down, then carefully, resigned, pulled my phone from the passenger cubby and powered it on.

I could explain in detail what happened next. It would be the natural thing to do, to describe how I recorded our conversation like a pestilential YouTuber until the bent-necked officer exploded and stormed away―I won’t do that. 

To me the whole thing was a dream. It worked. Of course it did. Randall *knew* it would more than he could let on, but none of that mattered. I may have survived highway patrol.

...But I wouldn’t survive this next part.

I watched as the black and white cruiser pulled in front of me and screamed down the highway. Smaller, smaller, *gone*. *How does the officer see out his windshield?,* I wondered distantly. I set my phone in the drink holder without bothering to power it off. What I did no longer mattered. 

I waited.

Waited.

Waited

A line of clouds appeared over the horizon line, dark and hostile. They rolled in at an unnatural speed. Outside my windows, the wind picked up. Dust devils rose up across the desert.

My end was here.

Randall never would have agreed to my one condition if he thought I’d survive.  I knew almost nothing about him, but I knew that much. That was the only reason I’d made our deal: to see his response. Never, for any reason, would he or the rest of management tell me the truth about the road.

He needed me to avoid highway patrol. He couldn’t allow any of the living things on Route 333 to get to my cargo, but whatever was coming for me now was in some sort of a different category. It wasn’t alive. It *was* deadly though. Enough he knew he wouldn't have to uphold his end of our bargain.

I inhaled.

I exhaled.

Clouds rushed in above me, and thick drops of rust-colored liquid slid down my windshield. Blood. The end.

Even now, I [wasn’t nervous](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/).
