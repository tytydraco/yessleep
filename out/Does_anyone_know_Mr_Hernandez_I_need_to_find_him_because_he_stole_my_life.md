Does anyone know Mr. Hernandez? I just need to find him.
Mr. Hernandez is a Latin-American man, about 5 '7 tall, with a small black mustache — or maybe he looks like me. Or maybe he looks completely different. I don’t even know anymore...
I just want him to give me my life back!

It all happened a few years ago, the day I met Mr. Hernandez. It had been a really shitty day, and I walked into the bar on the corner. I used to go there whenever I had a bad fight with my girlfriend or just needed to unwind. This was one of those days.
I don’t even remember what we argued about — back then, we fought about pretty much everything. She wanted more from me — more attention, more time... maybe even a proposal after five years together. Or at least a better job.
But I didn’t want any of that.
I was a burned-out, 33-year-old guy who sometimes drank himself numb just to make life feel a little easier.

That was the day I met Mr. Hernandez.
When I walked into the bar, he was trying to convince the bartender to play poker with him, but the guy just waved him off.
That’s when he saw me come in — and like a street vendor hawking cheap goods, he walked up to me with a wide grin.


“Hey there, friend! Feel like playing a little game with me?” Mr. Hernandez beamed.


I just waved him off, not in the mood, and headed straight for the bar. But he chased after me.


“Well... how about I buy you a drink?”


That, I didn’t turn down. After all, I came here to drown my problems.
Mr. Hernandez bought us an entire bottle of whiskey and asked for two glasses — said it looked like I needed it. We sat down at a table and started drinking. All the while, he tried to dazzle me with stories — he talked about everything he could think of.

When the alcohol started to kick in, he switched roles and began asking questions.
Who was I? What did I do? Where did I work? Basic stuff.
And then came the question I think he’d been waiting to ask all evening:


“My dear friend... if you could have one wish, what would it be?” he said, draining his glass.


I looked at him through a haze of alcohol, confused — like I didn’t quite understand what he was asking. Mr. Hernandez said nothing. He just stared at me, waiting for my answer. After a moment of drunken fumbling, I blurted out,


“I… I guess I’d want to be a millionaire!”


I raised my glass as if to toast the idea.
The place was empty except for the bartender — and even he was just rolling his eyes at us. Mr. Hernandez still didn’t say a word. He just kept staring — like he didn’t believe me, sizing me up suspiciously.


“I don’t think that’s what you really want, my friend,” he finally said.


I grew quiet. Deep down, I knew he was right. My life was a mess. A crappy office job that drained me, with a paycheck that barely covered rent. I was completely estranged from my family — even phone calls with my parents turned into arguments. And my girlfriend… I don’t think she loved me anymore. Hell, I didn’t think I loved her either.
It all just came spilling out.


“I want to be someone else,” I said quietly, and knocked back my drink.


Mr. Hernandez gave me a wide, satisfied grin. He looked like a man who’d just closed a deal.
Then he reached across the table, hand outstretched.
I didn’t say a word. I shook his hand.


“So be it, my friend,” he said.


I had no idea how long we stayed at the bar that night — but when I woke up, I wasn’t at home. I came to in some unfamiliar apartment.
I’d never drunk so much in my life that I completely blacked out and went home to the wrong place. But here I was.

Hungover and dazed, I pulled myself together just enough to figure out where the hell I was.
It was a run-down little place — apart from a rickety bed and a few pieces of furniture, there wasn’t much inside. My clothes were scattered across the floor, so I quickly got dressed and decided to leave — wherever the hell I even was.

Once I got down to the street, I realized where I was. We lived not far from there — maybe two or three bus stops away. Since it was the weekend, I decided to walk home instead.
Gave me time to pull myself together and figure out what I’d tell Beth about where I’d been.
When I got to the front gate of our building, that’s when I noticed — I didn’t have anything on me. No phone. No wallet. No keys to get inside.


“That fucker Hernandez… or whoever the hell he is… must’ve robbed me,” I thought.


That’s when the front gate opened, and one of the neighbors came out with her little daughter. The woman glanced at me nervously — like I was some shady criminal.
I greeted them the way I always did, but they didn’t respond. They just hurried off down the street.

Whatever — at least I made it into the building, I thought. All I wanted now was to get home and crash on the couch.
Up on the third floor — where we lived — I knocked on the door and called out for Beth, asking her to let me in since I didn’t have my keys. I hoped she was home. I really didn’t want to spend the night outside my own front door.

But then… the door opened.

And it wasn’t Beth who answered.
It was me.
I just stood there in silence, staring, trying to process what the hell I was looking at. The “me” inside the apartment snapped at me, dragging me out of my confusion with an angry tone:


“Who the fuck are you and what do you want?”


I blinked, staring at myself — what the hell was this? There were two of me?
I finally managed to mutter:


“Who the hell are you, and why do you look exactly like me?”


The other me looked me over with disgust, then sneered:


“Maybe I look like shit, but at least I’m not a fat, washed-up drunk piece of shit.”


That’s when I noticed Beth standing behind him, looking nervous, watching everything unfold. I tried to speak directly to her, ignoring this imposter:


“Beth! What the hell is going on?! Who is this guy?!”


Beth didn’t say a word. She just stepped back behind the door, as if trying to disappear from view. The other me turned to her and asked if she knew me — but Beth simply replied,
“I’ve never seen this man before in my life.”

Then he turned back to me, and without warning, shoved me hard, forcing me away from the door.


“Get the fuck out of here, asshole, or I’m calling the cops! — he shouted, and slammed the door in my face.”


I just stood there in front of the door, frozen — then ran to the elevator to look at myself in the mirror. But I still looked exactly the same as I did yesterday.
So I went back and started banging on the door again. But all I got was the other me shouting that he’d called the cops and I’d better get lost.

I waited in the hallway for a little while longer, but I figured I’d better leave. I didn’t have any ID on me — and if the other guy had my papers, I could get into serious trouble.
So I headed down to the street.
A passerby came walking toward me — naturally, he veered off like I was some kind of weirdo. I asked him to help me, to just tell me what I looked like, but the guy didn’t say a word. He just looked at me with disgust and hurried off.

I figured I’d better go back to the apartment I’d woken up in. And sure enough, it was the same crappy place — the rundown apartment.
But this time, I found a driver’s license.
It was issued to someone named Terrence — a really shady-looking guy.
Exactly the kind of person you’d cross the street to avoid if you saw him walking toward you at night.

But seriously... what the hell was going on? Who was this guy? And what was I doing in his apartment? And what the hell did Mr. Hernandez do to me?

Then it hit me: I had to go back to the bar. I had to find him.


Of course, the bar was closed.
I shouldn’t have expected anything else — it was Sunday noon, after all. But the bartender was out front, stacking crates near the entrance — so maybe I had a bit of luck left.

When I walked up to him, he immediately tried to shoo me away, muttering something about “no free booze, go beg somewhere else.” But once I convinced him I just had a few questions, he finally agreed to talk.

I asked about Mr. Hernandez, but he said he didn’t know anything about him — had never seen the guy before in his life. Only yesterday, when he came into the bar with me. He said the two of us drank together until closing time, then left like we were best buddies.
When I asked him what the guy looked like — the one Mr. Hernandez was drinking with — the bartender gave me a strange look… Then described someone who looked exactly like me.

But when I pressed him, asking if the guy had looked the same all night long, he told me to quit with the crazy talk — and went back into the bar, locking the door behind him.

I stood there, totally lost. I had no idea what was happening. No idea what to do.
And that’s when a car screeched to a stop beside me. A black Mercedes, windows tinted dark.

Two huge, bald, muscle-bound guys jumped out. One of them punched me in the gut so hard I dropped to the pavement gasping — and then they grabbed me and shoved me into the trunk.


The car stopped somewhere near the docks.
When they dragged me out, I saw cargo ships all around. An old man was standing in front of me, and the two bald gorillas held me down so tightly I couldn’t move — I was just kneeling there, terrified.


“Terrence,” the old man began, “Terrence, where’s my damn stash?”


I just stared at him, confused — what the hell did this guy want from me? One of the big guys smacked me across the face, and blood started trickling from my nose.
The old man waved for him to stop.


“Terrence,” he continued, “I told you last time — give me what you promised.
You said you had it.”


I was getting more and more nervous. My thoughts were spinning. Why was this guy calling me Terrence? What the hell did he want from me? And how the hell was I going to get out of this mess?
And then I did the dumbest thing I could’ve done — I started explaining.


“Sir,” I stammered, “I don’t know who you are, or what package you’re talking about…
Honestly, I don’t even know who I am right now.”


The old man looked surprised for a moment — then gave a cheerful little smile and said:


“Well then, the boys’ll help jog your memory.”


I don’t think I’ve ever taken a beating like that in my life. The two goons pounded my face until it turned purple — barely keeping me conscious the entire time, like they knew exactly how far to go.
When they finally finished, the old man flicked his cigarette onto my half-dead body and said:


“Terrence, you owe me big. You’ve got two days to give me what you promised.”


Then they climbed back into the car and drove off — leaving me there on the pavement, a broken mess.


It was night by the time I came to. It was cold down by the docks, but the cool concrete felt oddly good against my bruised and battered face.

I slowly got to my feet and started walking — no real direction, just away. I didn’t know where I was going, only that I needed peace. Some quiet. Once I made it out of the docks, I got my bearings. I was a little outside the city, but I still knew the way home — even if it didn’t feel much like home anymore.

I walked all the way back.
People who were still out at that late hour gave me a wide berth, staring at me like I was something to fear. But no one offered help. Why would they? Even I didn’t know who I was anymore.

I walked up to my old apartment. There were lights on — I could see our windows glowing.
And there I was — or, my double — standing in the window with Beth.
They were kissing.
Beth was laughing at something, and the other me was talking to her.

Down below, the street was empty. My busted face throbbed with pain. I couldn’t watch anymore. I turned away from the life that used to be mine, and went back to that shitty apartment — the one I woke up in after the drinking.


It was already afternoon by the time I came to again in that run-down apartment.
I felt like absolute shit — couldn’t see out of my left eye, and I could barely breathe through what was probably a broken nose.
It felt weird, being asleep on a Monday at noon, not at work — but honestly, I would've given anything to be back at that shitty old job of mine.
That’s when it hit me: I needed to talk to my double.
Yeah, I can be a stubborn asshole — but I’ve got a brain, too. Maybe I could talk some sense into him. Figure out what the hell is actually going on.

I headed toward my old workplace.
I patched myself up as best I could, made it look somewhat less horrifying, but people still stared at me like I was something scraped off the pavement.
I had to talk to the other me. The guy who used to be me — because clearly, I’m not that person anymore.

Fucking Hernandez.


On my way to the office, people stared at me. I must’ve looked like shit. At least I’d changed out of my bloody clothes — I found a few decent ones in the closet. Still, walking the streets like this had me on edge. What if that old guy found me again? Or someone else came to finish the job?
But I had to try getting into work.

Luckily, it wasn’t that hard. I lied to the security guards, said I was Josh’s cousin — Josh being my old self — and that I had to pick up a package from him. I knew they wouldn’t care. Those guys didn’t give a shit about anything.

I took the elevator up to our floor, and the second the doors opened — there I was.
Again. Face to face with myself.

I didn’t have a choice. It was now or never. He wasn’t paying attention, tapping away on his phone — so I grabbed my double by the lapels and shoved him into the bathroom next to us.
There was just one intern in there, washing his hands — but I barked at him to get the fuck out, and he bolted without a word.
My double just stared at me, clutching his phone, wide-eyed.


“What the fuck is going on?! Who the hell are you — and why the hell do you look like me?!” I growled.


He didn’t say anything — just calmly brushed my hands off. I let go, but stayed right in front of him, blocking his way.


“Josh, you said it yourself,” he finally replied, cool as ice. “You wanted a new life.”


I was speechless. My double… was Mr. Hernandez. He’d taken my place — and I was stuck in someone else’s body.


“You said you wanted to be someone else,” he continued — still in my body. “So now I’m Josh. Poor, miserable Josh.”


I was furious. He’d screwed me over — and now I was trapped inside some criminal loser’s body.


“But hey, guess what, Josh,” he said, grinning. “I quit. That job sucked. I’ve got another interview coming up. Triple the pay.”


I just stood there, listening to all this bullshit. I wanted to smash that smug face in — my face. It was my goddamn face!
He just kept grinning down at me, cocky as hell.


“Oh, and guess what else — I’m gonna propose to Beth. You never had the balls, did you? She’s a fine piece of ass — don’t even know how you landed her to begin with…”


That’s when I snapped.
I punched him square in the nose — blood exploded everywhere. But Mr. Hernandez didn’t fight back. He just sat there, blood gushing from his face, grinning at me, mouth full of red, teeth shining through the mess.

So I hit him again. And again. And again — until he crumpled to the floor.

I swear I would’ve beaten him to death right there — but the security guards burst in.
That dumbass intern must’ve ratted me out. They pulled me off him —it was over.

Mr. Hernandez sat on the floor, spitting blood… and as they dragged me out of the bathroom, he looked up at me one last time — and smiled.


I didn’t think I’d get this screwed over — but the security guards called the cops.

Of course, they brought me in. Josh — or rather, Mr. Hernandez in my body — testified against me. And on the cameras, it was clear as day: I dragged him into the bathroom.
I knew I’d be convicted. What I didn’t expect was that Terrence — the guy whose skin I was now wearing — was a real piece of shit.

He’d already been convicted before — assault, drug possession, God knows what else.
So they didn’t waste any time. I got five years. No parole. Hard fucking time.


I won’t say much about prison. It was hell.

I was serving time for crimes I never committed. At first, I kept thinking — If I ever get out of here, I’m gonna kill Hernandez. But then again… he was me now. If I died — I’d never have a shot at getting my life back. So eventually, I let it go.

The years went by. At least here I had some peace. The old man never found me. Though sometimes, I still panicked — thinking someone might shank me in my sleep.
But I got lucky. Turns out this Terrence guy had some… connections inside. A few shady characters knew him — and they let me hang around.
Maybe even protected me — a little.


Five years had passed. And finally, I was free.
I knew exactly where I wanted to go first — I just didn’t know what I’d do when I got there.

I found out where Josh lived now. He and Beth no longer lived in our old place. Luckily, the couple living there now was helpful — even though they looked scared of me the whole time.

So I stood there, outside Josh’s new house. A nice little home, in a good neighborhood. The kind of place I never thought I’d ever live in.
 I rang the doorbell, and the door opened almost immediately. And there he was —my double. Again.

I’d imagined this moment so many times — what I would say, how I would act — but now that it was happening, I stood frozen. Speechless.
Josh — or the one in my body — spoke first.


“Good evening, sir. Can I help you with something?” His voice was calm, polite, soft.


I just stared at him. How the hell could he not recognize me? Could Mr. Hernandez really be this much of a bastard? Or was this another game?


“Don’t fuck with me, Hernandez,” I said finally, my voice shaking with anger. “Give me back what you stole from me.”


My double’s face turned pale. His eyes widened in shock. He glanced back into the house and called out:


“I’ll be right back, just talking to the neighbor!” Then he stepped out and closed the door behind him.


“Oh God,” he said, suddenly sounding relieved. “Finally — someone who knows something!”


I looked at him, wary. Was this a trick? Another setup?


“I’ve only been in this body for two weeks,” he said, excited and almost out of breath. “I don’t even know who this guy is or what the hell is going on…”


“Wait—” I cut him off, tense and suspicious. “You’re not Hernandez?”


“No! God, no!” he stammered. “That bastard tricked me! Asked me all these weird questions…”


“Then who the hell are you?” I snapped.


“I… I’m Matthew. I’m twenty-two. Two weeks ago I was working as a bartender, mixing drinks at some shitty club. I hated my job. Then this Mexican dude, Mr. Hernandez, shows up — says he can give me a new life. And I agreed. Now I’m here, I’m supposed to run a company, man — I’ve got a kid, and there’s another one on the way — I’m freaking the fuck out, I don’t know what I’m doing—”


The kid kept rambling, but I didn’t hear him anymore. I didn’t care.
He was just another puppet. Another victim of Mr. Hernandez.
I looked up at the window.

Beth was standing there. A little blonde girl in her arms — maybe three years old.
And Beth’s stomach… It was round again.

I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I broke down crying.

The boy — Matthew — kept talking beside me. But I only had one thought in my head.

I have to find Mr. Hernandez.
No matter what.
