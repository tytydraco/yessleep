(Hello English is not my first language sorry if I make mistakes .) In summer I visit village . Everytime I go to my backyard not really backyard but it's our territory I hear footsteps. My neighbour who spents lot of time there though it was nothing but me and second neighbour thought oderwise so we decided to investigate. I swear I saw trees move and heard footsteps, I never runned this fast in my life . Close there corn field there so one day I went there armed with knife I heard footsteps and saw it moving. I screamrd : "I'm armed I'm armed" but it didn't stop so I runned. Prior to running I heard gunshots but it's not weird in my country but it still seems off.  

   Afther that I never went there anymore . Now I find weird things in freezer. 10 days straight. First it was peace of paper than gums  . No one placed it there . Day 4 was getting worse it was spoon . Then on day 5 I found photo of me X out . I'm scared I almost runned away from house . I wish I did . Day 6 I found knife parts Painted with red . I called everyone I know .  My neighbours tried to call me down . I couldn't. HOW COULD I AFTHER I FOUND THIS THINGS. it's every nightmare I ever had . Day 7 that same knife was cutting my picture. I screamed horrified. I swear I heard laugh. I didn't sleep in my house that night. I went to my neighbour but I couldn't sleep. Next day  I found place trashed. I cleaned it with my neighbour. My neighbour decaded to stay with me. In afternoon we checked fridge . We found note saying: " you are next" . I think it was torwards my neighbour. We shared bed that night.
