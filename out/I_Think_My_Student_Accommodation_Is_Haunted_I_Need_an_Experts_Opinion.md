I think I’m being haunted. For context, I’m a Biomedical Science student at university. I’ve recently moved into my student accommodation since my building was kind enough to allow their tenants in early so they can settle in for the start of their next academic year. In my case, I'll be entering my second year of education after what felt like a war zone of deadlines and group projects. This brings me to why I’m writing this. Do ghosts leave letters?

 

As of last week, I’ve been living in a 5-bedroom flat as its only tenant. Also known as an apartment for any American readers. When I received my key from the reception, they gave me a weary smile and told me they were sorry they couldn’t put me in a room with many people. I told them I didn’t mind too much since the last flat I lived in, my roommates would often get drunk and be sick all over the kitchen floor without cleaning it up. I thought this would be a welcome change, I just didn’t think they meant there would be literally no one else. Don’t get me wrong, the flats nice. What was meant to be the communal kitchen is well stocked with two fridges and freezers, two ovens and stoves, a microwave, a kettle, and a state-of-the-art smart TV. Shame it’ll go to waste since I don’t watch TV all that much and I’m not about to shell out on a TV license without being able to split the cost with my roommates.

 

I didn’t realise I was living alone until about four days in. Upon arrival, I left a sticky note out in the kitchen saying hello, what my name was, as well as my phone number for when the group chat would be made. To my surprise, my note was left in the same spot I had left it in, and no other introductory notes or messages came my way. I didn’t think much of it and thought my roommates were probably just shy people who were going into their final year and just wanted to get in and out as quick as possible with no strings attached.

 

The fridges and cupboards remained empty for days leading me to conclude that I was the only person there. I decided to test this theory. The flat's layout is like this: The entrance door leads directly into a corridor, the corridor leads to the kitchen, on the left wall of the corridor there are two doors and on the right there are three doors, in the kitchen there’s a window on the left wall which looks out into the courtyard, and on the right wall there’s a window that looks out on to the street of which I’m on floor three.

 

I started with the first door on the right wall, the one situated next to my room. I knocked three times. Nobody answered. I knocked another three times. Still no answer. Taking a big breath and preparing myself for the most awkward interaction of my life I yanked on the handle and opened the door. Empty, just as I expected. Without any decorations, the rooms really do look like they’d been taken straight out of a prison documentary. Grey walls, hardwood floor painted grey, a dingey-looking mattress in the corner of the room supported by a stained bed frame, the desk an eroded mess of cracks and chipped paint. Don’t even get me started about the bathroom. Each room has its own en-suite fitted with a cubical shower, toilet, and sink. The light only elevated the apparent mould growing within the casting that surrounded it as well as the shower, making the whole room look like a cheap battleground used for paintball where they could only afford black coloured pellets. I gagged at the sudden wave of a damp odour that invaded my nostrils causing me to slam the door shut on instinct. There was no need to investigate further as I made for the door, the dim ray of sunlight projected into the middle of the room the last piece to the dreary collage.

 

I tried each of the rooms which all led to the same results except one which was beginning to show signs of development with the mould now expanding from the shower to the desk in the room itself. The only room I couldn’t get into was the one opposite mine. I followed the same improvised routine of knocking three times and waiting but this time when I tried the handle, I found it locked. After flattening my ear against the door I could make out a low humming sound. Each one of the doors has its own peephole so tenants can see who’s on the other side, but due to the fact there’s been no activity in the flat besides my own I can confidently rule out this room as being a storage room for the maintenance team and is likely where the flat’s boiler is located. They probably intended it to be a room but given how small it is, it was likely decided that they’d scrap the idea. I can tell it is small since the room next to it on the left wall juts out haphazardly into the building’s stairwell where this room instead is so small it leaves rather a ledge for people to rest on.

 

Sorry for the long-winded explanation, but I feel it best that you are made aware of every detail lest I leave out a critical piece of information that would otherwise result in my solution. I first started noticing signs of a potential haunting around a week ago. Both the corridor and the kitchen have lights that turn on automatically with motion detection. Last Thursday evening I left my room and went into the corridor on my way to the kitchen, only I was confronted by something. It sounds mundane but alongside everything else I’ll get to; this was clearly the first sign. Through the window of the kitchen door, I noticed the light was on. I admittedly stopped dead in my tracks, my stomach dropping a little. I laughed to myself at how ridiculous I was at being scared by a light where the likely explanation would be a fly or an insect that set it off. Upon entering, however, I noticed every cupboard door wide open. An insect couldn’t have done this. I froze my eyes darting back at the empty corridor behind me. Surely there was no one else there. I would have heard them go into their room or at the very least walking down the corridor. I decided on a meal of crisps and chocolate I had in my room, too afraid to cook anything. I didn’t investigate the other rooms. With how creepy they look in the day I’d hate to see what they look like at night.

 

Last Sunday night, or rather early Monday morning, I was woken up to screams outside my window. I shot bolt upright in my bed glancing at my alarm clock which read 2:07 AM and inched my head to the corner of my window. I shouldn’t be surprised at this point. My building is situated on my city’s “party scene”. A long street of clubs, bars, and eateries with the same agenda to fuel dopamine-hungry teenagers and bleed them dry at the same time. On this occasion, the screaming was a group of lads who had accidentally dropped their friend who had fallen face-first on the pavement before being sick all over himself. Rolling my eyes I started laughing when one of them decided they were going to abscond from their ways of being a public nuisance and went digging in one of the bins for an empty bag which he strapped around his friend’s ears to be sick in before moving on to the next street. Smiling I turned away from the window and back to my bed but not before noticing my door. The corridor light was on. Shining through the crack under the bottom of my door. This wasn’t what scared me. Creeping towards my door I became rooted to the spot. I dark shadow passed under my door from the left side, stopping in the middle. Swallowing my fear I attempted to sneak towards the door as the floorboards beneath me creaked in retort. Drenched in sweat, my breathing now resembling that of a steam train I looked through the peephole. My mouth filled with saliva I felt like was about to be sick as my heart raced at the discovery of no one there.

 

This has happened on several occasions. I never leave my room when it happens. Sometimes the shadow comes from the right, sometimes the left, but every time it stops in the middle of my door only to vanish when I look through the peephole. I never leave my room after this happens. I’m so afraid of the most mundane things that are probably just my own doing. Things like slightly ajar cupboards and drawers, and misplacing items, but all these never compared to what I discovered today. On the kitchen side, I found a note in the shaky handwriting of a toddler which simply reads “Hello”.

 

This leads me to my question. Do ghosts write letters? Or more appropriately, can ghosts write? I’m by no means an expert on the paranormal but everything is too unnatural, too strange, too illogical even for my own scepticism. Some of you reading this may think I’m overreacting, but you’re not here. You’re not living here alone with no one else to talk to. You’re not experiencing what I am and the daily stress that’s sending me over the edge. I don’t know. Maybe I’m just overthinking everything with how cooped up I’ve been lately. If there’s anyone out there who can give me some advice or an explanation, I’d really appreciate it.
