Have you ever watched yourself consume a living, breathing human being, piece by piece? 

Before a few days ago, I certainly hadn’t.

It was Friday night and I appeared to be peeling long strips off his forearm, chewing messily as rivulets of blood dribbled down the sides of my mouth and along the seams of the vinyl booth.

That night, we were a 24-hour fast-food restaurant.

He was caught up in its illusion at the time – the thing impersonating me. He wouldn’t have attempted to leave, even if booth he was sitting in hadn’t already been growing into his flesh to the point where the two were nearly indistinguishable. Even if his legs didn’t end in jagged stumps of gnawed bones instead of feet. He was alive, but barely. Already too far gone for our help. 

I’m not even sure how many lives it has claimed over the years – the bodies don’t exactly pile up; They disappear, pulled into the walls, the floor. Every inch of this place is built upon death.

I’ve seen some people absorbed both by the surfaces of the building itself, and others eaten by the creature that dwells inside.  That was the first time it had ever looked like me while doing so, though. 

It could’ve made it quick, but it rarely does. At first, I used to think of it in terms of a something feral and wild. Not evil, just hungry.

I’ve since learned otherwise – it seems to genuinely revel in the fear, the pain, of its victims.

It could’ve simply taken him while I was gone and I’d never have been the wiser, but no. It made sure he suffered and it made sure I was there to see it.

The man’s right forearm was nothing but bits of muscle attached to wet bones at that point, yet he kept trying to paw at the already soggy fries in front of him, the movement of each slick muscle visible. 

There wasn’t enough left of him to scream, but when he saw me, his eyes met mine, pain and realization dawning in them. He started to panic and struggle, and through his stare there was a desperate request I could not entirely read, but perhaps it was one for a faster exit from this world. 

It seems to enjoy restoring their awareness once its far too late to save them.

Before I could even attempt to help him, it pulled the rest of him into the fleshy portion of the building that had been masquerading as a vinyl booth. He wasn’t dead though – not yet. 

It will eat away at him for days, maybe weeks, maybe longer. I can still hear the others sometimes, those it took long before I even worked here. They ask me for help, for a reprieve, for things I cannot give them.

That Friday, I knew something was wrong the moment it began to warp the building in such a way that my return trip from the short hallway leading from the back room took 55 minutes. The hall narrowed and stretched on for what seemed like forever. At one point, the ceiling and walls began to creep in on me and became so tight that I could feel the fleshy texture that looked like brick and tile – until you looked closely –  as it slowly squeezed the air from my lungs. It let up right as spots began to dance across my vision. It can’t kill us – the creature itself can’t even touch us – the ritual sees to that, but that doesn’t stop it from tormenting us. When I’d finally made it back to what at that time was a dining room, it grinned at me with my own gore stained face, still eating, bits of gristle still in its teeth.

The worst part? The whole time, while I was crawling back through the shifting corridor and being squeezed like a human tube of toothpaste, I realized that someone must have wandered in. Helpless to do anything about it, I knew it was using that bought time to entrap our guest, and I knew that every minute I was gone, the higher the likelihood that they’d never leave this place again.

I’d gone back there looking for my manager, Grady, and he wasn’t even there. We lost someone on my watch, for nothing. 

I’ve never worked anywhere like this before, and sometimes, I wish I’d never found the place at all.

Some nights, the building is a restaurant, others a retail store. Those seem to be the most common, but once, it had even become a library. Out of curiosity I had picked up a book, it was that same fleshy texture as the walls, the floor, everything else in this living place, and written in a language I’d never seen before. It did have pictures though, and after what I saw – well, let’s just say, I’ll never sleep with the lights off again.

There used to be three people that worked here, then two. Then, just Grady before I came along. We work thirteen hours a day, seven days a week, so we’ve got an hour overlap each day. The long shifts and constant vigilance required really take a lot out of you, though. Makes it easier to slip up.

I had a couple of days when I was out sick, and Grady covered for me, 48 hours straight. I promised I’d make it up to him – he works so hard, I wish he could take a break.

I’m not proud to say it, but Friday wasn't the first time a loss had happened on my watch. 

Just days before, I'd been late and walked into Grady slowly and solemnly mopping away. That time, the victim was clearly already deceased. The body was picked clean, even the smaller and more delicate bones were already gone, the floor beginning to meld onto what remained, pulling the body downward. It had worked fast this time, a mercy not often granted to the other victims. The creature was nowhere to be seen – already moved to hunt elsewhere. 

I still wonder if it would have made a difference if I’d been there on time that day. I think it would have.

Of all the deaths, that one hit me the hardest.

Grady was nowhere to be seen when I went to say goodbye – headed out, I’d assumed at that the time. I had been trying to make up for my absence, going out of my way to clean, zealously trying sure no one else met the same fate, despite the building moving the doors around faster than I could keep up with. I was emptying what at the time was the trash when I saw it – a half-empty bag of chips with a note, from me, to Grady. His favorite kind. I didn't remember buying it – in general we try to avoid leaving any food or drinks around, it’s safer that way, but didn’t think much of it at the time.

I should’ve known something wasn’t right, because in the days leading up to the deaths, it was unusually smug.

Before that, things were fairly calm for a while. We'd have the occasional person wander in, lost, confused, while simultaneously insistent that this place – although it hadn't been known to them hours mere hours before – was always their destination, but we were usually able to prevent them from making the fatal mistake.

Not many people can find the place. The complex and monthly tasks my employer refers to as ‘the ritual’ seems to keep the majority of the population away. I'd started here in time to see the tail end of one, but it was a lot to take in and the initial pieces occurred before my first day. I was supposed to watch Grady and learn the rest of it this month.

I’m glad they’ve been able to hide this place for the most part. It draws people like – what’s that saying? Moths to a flame? I read recently why moths gather around light – it disrupts something within them, makes them unable to navigate. That’s the impact that this place, that its single full-time resident, seems to have on people. For those that can see it, it draws you to it, confuses you into thinking that this is exactly where you were supposed to be, whatever it wants you to do, was your goal the entire time.

Those of us that it can’t disorient, that see the place for what it is, we get recruited to try and help those that it can manipulate. I don’t know what brought this place or its lone inhabitant here to our town, I just work here – literally. I’m not even entirely sure who I work for –  I know my supervisor Grady, but I mean the people at the very top. 

One particularly rough day, I was told, this place was a small ranch style home, an average slice of suburbia. Those that wandered in claimed they were visiting a close friend (unperturbed by the fact that they couldn’t recall their friend’s name or anything else about them). It would offer them a trinket, food, a drink. Some of those that accepted would meet a swift end. The particularly unlucky ones would find themselves slowly being absorbed into the walls, the sofa, the floors. Pulled into a wet and suffocating embrace until they too became fuel for this living nightmare. So many people came in that day – and never left – that the building nearly doubled in size.

I’ve never seen its true form – it always resembles a person, though it never gets the movements quite right, they're too jerkily, almost as if it’s buffering – it’s surreal and a dead give away. The other indication is the constant look of thinly veiled hatred: it absolutely despises us, Grady and I. I don't blame it – if we didn't do our jobs, it’d have an easy and endless stream of meals. 

If it could have eaten us, it would have done so a very long time ago, but as long as we do not violate the one single rule – do not accept anything it gives you – it cannot take us.

If you do accept an offering or gift, it is then owed something in return. This rule is so deeply ingrained in its existence that even the ritual cannot save those who violate it, and it typically collects on this IOU the moment it becomes hungry. It seems to always be hungry.

For the past few days, it had watched me from mere inches away, unusually smug. When its eyes met mine I'd see a twisted look of satisfaction on its face, the taunting challenge of something lethal inviting you to come just a bit closer.

The way it had been eyeing me lately was an unwelcome reminder humans are not at the top of the food chain.

I was getting worried because Grady had also been acting strangely over the past few shifts – burn out, and you’re nearly guaranteed to make a mistake. 

He'd solemnly nod at me on our brief overlaps, but otherwise shuffled around, never even in the same room as it when he was supposed to be watching it.

I realized that his car hadn’t moved it for street cleaning days earlier and had begun to gather a coat of dirt and pollen, a thick wedge of leaves had formed behind the wheels.

Just a day ago, he left an envelope claiming to hold a bonus check within, on my purse. I’ve never heard of or received a bonus check the entire time I’d worked there. I did not take it, just gingerly moved it, and took my things.

I texted him to ask him if he was okay, but he never wrote back. I think Grady is gone, maybe has been for a while.

I was getting ready for work when I got the text from my sister, gushing over wanting to try this new seafood place that had opened up in town. I don’t get out much since I spend so much of my time at that place; I wasn’t alarmed at first that a new establishment had popped up without me knowing. 

Until she told me the cross streets it was on.

She’d never mentioned the building before. But now, she could see it.

I drove to work far faster than I was legally permitted to and when I pulled up, there was a line of people wrapping around the block. The building was massive, had gone from having one story, to three. A fleshy layer that spread just beyond the door outside like a living carpet had already begun fusing with those that stood on it, while they seemed oblivious. 

I can’t remember the last time Grady’s car had moved – was it before the ritual was supposed to be performed? Or after?

I never learned how to perform the first half on my own, and nothing I’ve found online has worked. Performing the second half alone does not work. I don’t know how to reach my employers.

 The doors are wide open, and people keep funneling in –  ignoring my pleas.

I saw a glimpse of it through the doors and once it spotted me, it carelessly let the person it had been pulling into pieces fall to the ground and headed my direction with that jerky gait and a twisted smile. 

A smile that said, finally.

I realized something, watching the fate of the patrons that filed or were unfortunate enough to even stand too close –  It’s not waiting for someone to accept a gift from it anymore, it hunts freely and without limitations.

At this rate the entire town will be gone in a week if not sooner.

I don’t know what to do. It’s still unable to pass beyond the doors, but what if it’s only a matter of time before that stops working, [too?](https://www.reddit.com/r/JamFranz/)
