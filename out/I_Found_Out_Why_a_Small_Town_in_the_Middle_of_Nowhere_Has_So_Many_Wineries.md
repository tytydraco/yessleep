On Halloween, I decided to go see a haunted house out in a somewhat nearby small town. When I take any sort of long car trip, I tend to make a day of it and do as much as I can in the area to get as much out of the time and money it takes. There wasn't much where I was going, but it looked like a beautiful area and there were a lot of wineries. I grew up in the rural Midwest but quickly moved to the Northeast as soon as I was able to leave home. As happy as I was to finally get out and finally start my life, pictures of the area made me somewhat nostalgic.

The day started off normal enough. I went to a coffee shop just outside of my town for lunch. The drive was nice. Like I said there weren't a lot of businesses, but I got to see plenty of classic rural scenery. Then, I went to several spots to hike. That actually ended up taking up a pretty large portion of the day. I didn't mind because everything was so beautiful, especially with the fall leaves.

Next, I decided to go to the local historical museum. When I walked in, I was greeted by a tall, clean-shaven young man in a Harvard sweatshirt. He took me through all of the exhibits they had and emphasized their seasonal exhibit on the cult of Agre.

The museum was pretty interesting. Most of it was about how the area had been settled by immigrant farmers from modern day Ukraine and Russia. Then it went into the physical geography and how that contributed to its massive agricultural output. It went through the typical things these museums do; it showed old farm equipment and the town various points in history. Apparently, after a long period of widespread crop failure, the town was on track to become a booming hub for the burgeoning banking industry, but many of the wealthy bankers were forced out because they had progressive views on the treatment of Black and Indigenous people, which came into conflict with the local population. For a small town museum it really went into detail about the Indigenous groups in the area. I was especially surprised to see how far they went in talking about the Indigenous genocide and mistreatment of Black migrants by the local settlers.

Things really got strange at the cult of Agre exhibit. It started with a video, that had strangely high production values for a local museum. The exhibit also had actual clothing, folk art, and religious artifacts and texts from the cult members. It was quite elaborate for something that was just a seasonal exhibit.

The members of the cult worshipped a god named Agre. He looked like a muscular bearded man with scars all over his body, holding a knife in one hand and a book in the other. Followers believed that they were inherently superior and Agre would reward them with power over the entire world if they followed his teachings and punished those who went against him. To please Agre, they would brutally torture and sacrifice non-believers, especially non-white people and women, on Halloween night, and drink a wine infused with special herbs called the autumn sacrament. Blood was slowly drained from living children until they eventually died of blood loss. It got really graphic. I was surprised they didn't give some sort of warning. What if someone brought their kid in there?

"Hey, how was it?" the employee, Chad, Asked as I came back toward the front desk.

"It was interesting. I was surprised how deep you guys went into the Indigenous stuff. Most museums in small towns don't get so deep into stuff like that."

"Yeah, the historical society is really adamant about showing the full history. Makes a lot of the locals mad."

"I'm from a small town, so I definitely see that."

"What brings you up here?"

"I came up here for the haunted house," I explained. "Thought I would also try some of the wineries around here."

"None of them are that good," He shot out, seeming slightly nervous.

"Well, I think i'll try a few anyway; there isn't much else to do." I responded.

"Why don't you come to my place? We're having a Halloween party."

"Uhhhh, what? No thanks." I stammered nervously at the bizarre request.

"Right, right. I guess they're at least worth checking out. Just don't drink the autumn sacrament; it's what they make with all the grapes that weren't good enough for anything else." He said, rapidly changing his tone.

"Alright, good to know."

"Oh, and the haunted house is awesome. All the proceeds actually benefit the historical society."

"Awesome, good to know. Well, I better get going."

"Okay, nice talking to you."

As I drove to the first winery, I noticed there were two types of houses I passed. First, there were small houses or farms that had some sort of black spray-painted image of Agre, like I saw in the museum. There were also big tacky houses that were clearly new and didn't match the town at all. All of those houses had signs for the historical society. I guess the historical society is a little more in tune with the town's history. It was weird how every house had either one or the other and none had both. I'm pretty familiar with these small town culture wars from my own hometown, but it was strange how there was no deviation.

When I arrived at the first winery, I noticed how run down it looked. The building was an old barn that seems like it had been renovated at one point but had fallen back into disrepair. I walked inside and saw a small old woman with with a German shepherd on a leash. I walked up to the small bar, looked at their menu and ordered a cabernet franc. It wasn't an all time great, but it was pretty solid. I guess guys who go to Harvard get a little snobby about wine.

"So are you from around here?" The old woman asked.

"No, I'm here for the haunted house."

"Oh, that place is a waste of money. Best skip that."

"Well I'm already up here, and it benefits the historical society."

"Pfff, all those bastards can just rot in hell. Just a bunch of rich folks talkin' about how bad and evil this town is. None uh them are even from around here. Tryin' to buy up everyone's land. No decent person I know would ever sell to them."

Chad at the museum was kind of negative about the wineries, but it didn't seem like the historical society was this vitriolic. Also, what was the problem with them buying up land. The town is poor and it seems like selling selling some land to rich people would help a lot of people out. These wineries are in such bad shape it probably wouldn't be a bad idea for a few of them to be sold and turned into something more profitable. I guess I forgot how resistant to change small town people can be.

"Have you been to any other wineries today?" She pivoted

"No."

"Well here, try this. It's on the house," She said pouring me a glass of red wine, which was noticeably larger than the one I had just drank, "It's called autumn sacrament."

It was interesting, in a good way. It was smokey, had some herb flavor, and a slight fruit note.

"So why are there so many wineries in a small town like this?" I asked. There were well over a dozen, which was ridiculous for a town this size.

"Well, the farmers need somethin' to do."

"Your farmers are big wine drinkers?"

"Yup!"

The next winery I went to was in a rectangular building made mostly of wood and corrugated metal. The bartender, a large blonde woman in her forties, immediately asked me if I wanted to try the autumn sacrament. At this point, I was in the mood for a white wine, so I ordered a chardonnay. She seemed disappointed, got me my chardonnay, and asked if I had been to any other wineries and if I planned to go to anymore. I told her about the one I had been to, the wine I had there, and the one I planned to go to next. She seemed relieved when I mentioned the autumn sacrament. However, when I told her about the haunted house she gave me the same warning as the last place. Also, while she wasn't as openly aggressive toward the historical society she shared similar sentiments to the woman at the first winery and seemed to be holding back a lot of anger.

After that, I went to a small dive bar for dinner. I got a burger and a high life. The bar had the cheap American lagers and low to middle tier booze I associated with small town dive bars, but they also had a huge selection of local wines. There were two other tables in the bar. Each with four blue collar guys, who I would expect to be beer drinkers, all drinking red wine.

I asked the bartender "Do you get many tourists around here?" I didn't see any hotels or anything, but that would at least explain how this town could support so many wineries.

"No." he said puzzled "Have you been to any wineries, today?" He asked totally unprompted.

I hesitantly told him about the wineries I had been to and the one I was going to after I ate. I omitted anything about the haunted house because I didn't need another rant about how it was a ripoff or the historical society. He poured me a glass of another winery's autumn sacrament. He said I had to try it and it was on the house. After I finished that glass, he gave me yet another winery's autumn sacrament. In the parking lot outside, I looked up autumn sacrament to see exactly what it was because it did taste like a distinctive style, contrary to what Chad told me. The only results that came up were for wineries in the local area and no other information.

The last winery I went to was a log cabin with an eight seat bar, bottles around the walls of the building, and one bathroom. Apparently, the actual wine making was done elsewhere on the property. This time my bartender was a young woman who appeared to be in her late twenties. She gave me the typical recommendation of the autumn sacrament, but I couldn't take any more red wine at this point and ordered a riesling. Because I figured a younger person might be more reasonable, I told her about my plans to go to the haunted house. She wasn't angry like the others, but she said it wasn't worth it and that it would be better for me to head back home and call it a night. She offered me an autumn sacrament on the house. As much as I hate refusing free wine, I wouldn't be okay to drive if I had another drink. As I walked out the door, she shoved a bottle of autumn sacrament in my hands and told me to be careful and leave before sundown.

The haunted house was expensive at $30, but I had fun. Surprisingly there were no images of Agre. He really seems to be a big part of the local folklore, so I'm surprised the historical society didn't want to include him. I was about to leave before it got dark, but I was stopped by Chad, who was volunteering. We made slightly awkward small talk for about 45 minutes, before I decided to drive home. It had gotten pretty dark by the time I left.

As I was driving home, I started to see people on the side of the road yelling at me to pull over and wearing white cloaks with black images of Agre, like I saw in the Museum. A few of them ran in front of my car. These weren't just dumb kids playing a prank; there were plenty of adults and they were really putting themselves in danger. I managed to dodge all of them, but another car came up beside me and started trying to run me off the road. After I managed to get a decent distance ahead of it, a truck pulled out of a driveway and blocked the road. At that point, I decided if I was going to die, I would at least mess up this guy's truck. Luckily, he saw I wasn't going to stop and moved out of the way.

Soon, I turned into the driveway of a house with a historical society sign. I banged on the door and was quickly let in by a dark-haired man in a suit, who locked the door behind me. There were two others in the living room. One was a muscular bald man, and the other was this a short, young woman with long, dark hair, who appeared to be fairly drunk.

"I'll explain what's going on in a minute, but first let's move to the kitchen." the man said pointing down a short hallway.

The two others and I slowly walked down the hallway. When we got to the kitchen we all froze. There were corpses with large portions of their flesh missing suspended from the ceiling by meathooks. We all turned around and saw that the man who had invited us in had changed. He had grown large curving fangs, long pointy claws, and his skin had turned leathery and grey. He lunged at the other man, who tried to fight back. Despite how muscular he was, he couldn't even fight back and was ripped apart and partially devoured. The creature came for me next and I instinctively tried to fight him. Surprisingly I could actually keep him off me with some success. The woman also began to attack him and was actually able to do some damage. I ran to the door to make a route for us to escape. After I unlocked it, three of the people in those cloaks from earlier ran into the house. They rescued the woman and, while they left it alive, they beat the creature to a bloody pulp. We followed the people who rescued us into their pickup truck and each us put on cloaks like they were wearing, as they instructed us. They were both way too big for us, but we didn't complain.

Eventually, the truck arrived at a large, but shabby farmhouse with tons of vehicles around the property and images of Agre all over. We didn't know what was going on, but we didn't really have any choice, but to listen to the ones in the cloaks. On the inside, there was a huge pot luck going on with everyone just casually, drunkenly chatting and drinking autumn sacrament. The bartender from the first winery I went to walked up to us and handed us two full pint glasses. After the night we were having neither of us were going to say no.

"Just relax, the pictures of Agre will keep those things away, and the autumn sacrament will help you fight back." She reassured us, "Just make yourselves at home."

I found a chair and gradually drank my wine by myself. Afterwards, I stood up.

"Okay, what the hell is going on?" I demanded!

A towering old man began to get up from his chair but was stopped by a large, bearded Arab man.

"No, you just relax. I'll talk to him, Ivan. Hello, my name is Amir. I can tell you everything you. Let's just go someplace quiet." said the second man.

"You can use my daughter's old bedroom." A woman from the crowd told us.

When we got their Amir explained the entire situation and the history of the cult of Agre to me. I'll do my best to explain it from what I remember. Agre had been worshipped farther back than can be reliably documented. However, the modern history of the religion didn't really begin until the prophet Oleksiy was given the Book of Life by Agre. One night, Oleksiy, an illiterate peasant at the time, woke up and spent the night carving the contents of the book into the walls of his house and some trees near his land. The writings were eventually written on paper and spread to followers of Agre. The Book of Life's primary use was spreading how to fight against the creatures we saw that night, which had just begun to appear in Europe. However, it also explained the virtues of living a productive and happy life through hard work, altruism, fostering strong communities, and maintaining a connection to the land. Some day if people lived by the rules and principles explained in the book of life, all of those who were virtuous and made the world better with their work and service to Agre and their fellow man would rule the world, instead of lords and kings. Amir had a copy of the book of life with him, and I recognized it from the museum. However, the museum took the Book of Life out of context to make Agre's teachings appear evil. After many years, Oleksiy had become an influential leader among followers of Agre and settled with many other followers in the United States, where there was more plentiful farmland and a chance to spread the teachings of Agre even further.

The next foundational book for the Cult of Agre is the Book of Death. It begins with the previously discussed story of Oleksiy's life and the early days of the cult of Agre's settlement in America. Oleksiy died after about three years in the New World. After a short period of prosperity following his death, his grandson Mykhailo, often referred to as "the false prophet," began to twist Agre's teachings. For example, he preached that only those who worshipped Agre, especially those who came from long lineages of followers, were destined to rule the world instead of the virtuous and productive. He used this logic to justify stealing from the Indigenous people and exploiting and marginalizing Black people, on the grounds that they did not worship Agre or were not descended from the original worshippers of Agre. Even Agre's teachings on self-sacrifice were twisted into demands for human sacrifice, which was used as a method for suppressing those who stood up against the exploitation and oppression carried out by Agre's worshippers. These distortions were absurd and the results clearly went against Agre's vision, but too many followers believed them because they were blinded by their own greed and lust for power. Agre punished his wayward followers by causing their crops to fail.

Soon after, the creatures Agre's followers fought in the Old Country began to appear near his followers in the New World. While the creatures only devour flesh on Halloween night, they spread famine, disease, and bad luck to those in the area and attempted to make them stray from virtuous paths. Agre's followers and the Indigenous eventually put aside their ugly history and fought off these creatures, but the creatures managed to wipe out all of the cult of Agre's Indigenous allies.

The Book of Death was discovered by Anna, a descendant of Oleksiy. One day she began to furiously dig a hole in a nondescript spot in a clearing. Eventually, she found the body of an Indigenous man. His body had rotted, but he was holding a tome that was perfectly in tact and written in blood, which later became the Book of Death. All evidence suggest that this man died before the events he described took place. His name is unknown, but the cult of Agre refers to him as "the prophet Manitou."

Currently, the creatures are taking over the town and the Cult of Agre is too weak to find a permanent solution. If they kill the creatures they risk getting law enforcement involved and doing further damage to the cult of Agre. All of their allies have been wiped out or abandoned the fight against the creatures. There is a lot of uncertainty right now. Amir, who was not born in the town, is the first religious leader the town has had who is not a descendant of Oleksiy. The town reluctantly accepted this because all three of Ivan's children, like many of the town's children, moved away to avoid the creatures. Amir and many others believe that a new prophet will deliver a "Book of Rebirth" that will lead the virtuous in finally eliminating the creatures and fulfilling Oleksiy's prophecy.

I can't disclose several details of the town I visited due to how powerful and influential the creatures are. The one thing I can recommend is, if you are ever in the middle of nowhere in the Northeast and see a strange number of wineries, please have a glass.
