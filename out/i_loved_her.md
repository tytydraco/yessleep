those three words run around in my head over and over again.
“i. loved. her… her… her!”
my mind lingers on that word. her. it gets louder as i look back up to the front of the church.
“i. loved. her… loved… love-d?”
i focus on that final letter, that single d that changes the meaning of that word entirely.
“loved? why not love?” i ask myself.
love, it’s a painful word for me to think about. i think about it once more.
“love-d” the word pierces me like a stray bullet: two stray bullets. first piercing my mind and then my heart.

the people around me stand up; i do the same without thinking about it.
i remain stood idly as the silhouettes around me move away. finally, i come back round and leave the depths of my mind.

looking up again, i’m still greeted by the front of the church, along with photos of a woman my mind doesn’t let me look at. flowers are displayed around, their aroma assaults my nose as if they’re taunting me.

i force myself to look at the photos of the woman; it’s maria. the beautiful girl from my history class. i recognise her hair, plated and brunette. her hair was what got me to speak to her. 

she was a quiet type, never doing anything that would bring any attention to her, yet i noticed her. i’d always focus on her, her presence would loom on my shoulders: i couldn’t ignore her.

my eyes start to well up with tears as i think about the day i asked her to be my girlfriend. it was such a magical night. i set up a nice date for us at the best restaurant i could afford. she was stunning that night, a goddess in the flesh. i remember how she would glow, her skin was beaming with beauty, her body was irresistible; enhanced by her tight dress. i couldn’t stop looking at her that night.

“i’ll never get to speak to her again” i say to myself, perhaps a little too out loud. i look around, i’m alone. i start to think about maria again. she would fill me with such desire by just being near me.

then the anger begins to set in.

it fills my soul and blood as i think about her. i go back to that night when i asked her to be mine. such a perfect night… and she ruined it.

“i’m sorry,” she said, “you’re not my type, i’m already talking to this other guy.”

i get shot in the heart again as i think about those three words once more. 

i. loved. her.

why did she say no? i’m everything she could ever want and more.

i leave the church, now remembering i was at her funeral, and begin to head back home. the anger i felt the night she rejected me is still lingering in my chest. then the adrenaline kicks in when i remember grabbing her and throwing her into my car. 

i smile as i remember the shiny blade i painted red with her blood, her screams as she lay on my basement floor, that skin she had, fading, her life leaving her. such a magical night.

i finally return home, now full of excitement. i rush upstairs to greet my beautiful girlfriend maria, still laying in bed from where i last left her. i kiss her before laying close to her.

“i almost forgot, it’s time for dinner!” i say as i get back up. maria’s left leg is missing after being the main course three nights in a row. time for her right leg.

her body is irresistible after all, and when i’m done with it she’ll be mine forever.

i. love. her.
