I (28F) grew up in a rural province in the Philippines. Back then, we had almost no technology, even our lights were torch-lit lamps.

There were a lot of myths and legends surrounding the area, but this... this, I’d never heard of.

I was 13, and my little brother, Joshua, was 9. We were walking home after playing with our friends. It was getting late, the sky growing darker and gloomier. A light drizzle started, so we decided to take the shortcut through the fields.

Yeah, bad idea… I know. But it was the shortest path home. Our house was directly on the other side. The grass wasn’t too tall, about chest height for the average adult. But we were small Filipino kids, so it towered over us.

There was already a path through the weeds, worn down from all the times my friends and I passed through. We’d even placed landmarks, old shoes on sticks and fences, pointing the right direction.

Along the way, we’d also built these little statues of ourselves using big sticks, reeds, old clothes, and random stuff we were proud of.  I was a bit of a tomboy back then, so mine had a pellet Deagle, confiscated by my dad from some street kids (he was a cop).

The thick fog was rolling in fast. It was getting harder to see. The only lights were dim lamps from distant houses, flickering as the wind picked up, some were already starting to go out. We didn’t have much time left.

But something felt... off as we passed the statues.

There were six of us in the group. There were seven statues.

I stopped, counted again. Yep. Seven.

I dont recognize this one. This wasn't ours.

It wasn’t dressed like ours, just a filthy tattered sheet draped over its frame.

Some parts of it were made of metal. And even weirder?

It had too many arms. Too long for its body, some were big, most were small.

Like someone kept adding extra limbs just to see what would stick. They hung at odd angles, stiff in some places, too loose in others, like they didn't fully know how to use them....

Who made this one?

Maybe for one of my friend’s little siblings? Maybe someone new joined the group?

I didn’t have too much time to think. It was getting dark.

The light rain turned into a downpour. We started sprinting. It was raining so heavily it hurt when it hit our backs. As we ran, I began to hear faint creaking behind us... and more footsteps than there should’ve been.

Then my brother tripped. We were holding hands, so I fell with him. The ground was muddy and sloped, we slid back several feet.

I got up, laughing a little. “*Are you okay?*”

No answer.

He was gone.

My heart sank.

What?? How?? He was right next to me.

*“Jo!!”* I shouted. “*Joshua! Where are you?!*”

No answer.

I searched the area, panicked. Then I heard the creaking again, off to the left. Clanking footsteps. A strong, awful smell of rust carried by the wind.

I headed toward the sound, still calling out. 

“*Jo! Let’s go home!*”

Then I saw light. A lamp?

How? The wind was so strong… It should've been blown out by now….

Still, I rushed toward it like a moth to flame.

I was just a few steps away when the lamp, and whatever was holding it up, suddenly collapsed.

The creaking shifted, moving quickly from one side to the other, and the stench disappeared with it. Like it was hiding from me.

The ground where the light had been was empty, nothing but muddy grass... but when I looked closer, I saw one of Joshua’s slippers. The strap was broken.

I froze.

Somewhere close, I heard a soft, strained… “*Ate…*” (Big sis).

Barely a whisper. Like it came just from behind the tall grass. Weak… Tired… but familiar…

I scurried to check. Then just when I was about to pull the weeds back…

“***ATEEE!!!***”

A scream, louder, sharper and more desperate, rang out behind me... It was Joshua’s voice.

My head snapped toward it. My legs moved before I could think.

And there it was again, the lamp, flickering in the distance like a beacon.

I ran toward it, sobbing. “*Stay where you are! Please!*”

The rusty smell got stronger with every step.

As I got closer I heard… Breathing? It was dry and raspy, like an old man wheezing.

I stopped dead.

“*Jo?*”

No answer.

Instead, the light inched closer. The creaking grew louder.

I could hear more than two footsteps. Slow, heavy, stomping ones, and light, skittering ones, like something crawling in the mud.

It was moving toward me. And it was fast.

Immediately, I turned and ran, didn't dare to look back.

It was chasing me. I could hear it wheezing, clanking, groaning.

I saw my house up ahead. The porch. Safety. 

I banged on the door with all my strength.

“***Mama! Papa!*** *Open the door! Let me in!!*”

^(But nobody came.)

“*Let me in!*” echoed whatever was behind me, *in my voice*.

It was close.

I looked around desperately. No other way in. Then I saw the tall coconut tree beside our house. We’d used it for harvesting, so it had carved footholds.

I climbed. High.

When I reached the top, I looked down. Nothing. Even the light was gone. I couldn’t even see the base of the tree that well. That’s how dark it was that night.

The storm eventually died down. I clung to the trunk until sunrise.

As soon as it was bright enough to see, I climbed down, crossed the street, and walked as far from the field as I could. Then, collapsed on the neighbor’s porch.

That’s all I remember.

I woke up in a hospital, I knew it was far from home, since there were tall buildings outside the window. My aunt was there. She told me everything.

Apparently, the neighbors found me lying on their porch, eyes wide open, muttering “*demonio*” over and over before passing out. I was hospitalized immediately, bruises and gashes all over, hands and feet turning pale blue. I fell into a coma. Weeks later, I was transferred to a better hospital in the city.

Then she told me about Joshua.

They found him the next morning... at the foot of his statue.

Still wearing his other slipper. Unrecognizable. Dismembered beyond belief.

As if he was ripped open by a bear, but there are no bears in the Philippines.

She asked what happened. I told her. Everything.

I knew she wouldn’t believe me. But she never called me crazy. Understanding the trauma I was in, she let me stay with her in the city, until I was ready to face the world again.

Today, I work as a criminal investigator, mostly missing children’s cases.

And now, I’m back here.

Back in the quiet little village of San Isidro.

Back to investigate another missing child... one that vanished exactly like my brother did.

We’re staying the night at the child’s home. My team’s asleep. We start at sunrise.

The wind stopped hours ago. No crickets. No dogs barking.

Just silence so thick it feels like the house is holding its breath with me.

I can hear it…

Wheezing, groaning, clanking.

That ever so familiar stench of rust, back in the air.

It’s outside. It knows I’m awake.

It never tried the door. Never knocked.

It just waits. Like it knows the house can’t protect me forever. Like it has all the time in the world.

It remembers me. It’s welcoming me home. I’ll be sure to see you tomorrow.

Oh, how I missed this feeling of dread.

I’m posting this to warn the parents who might read this:

Be strict about curfews. Make sure your children come home on time. No one deserves to go through what my family did.

**Keep your kids inside at night. Please.**

As for me…

I don’t think I ever truly left that night behind.

Part of me is still up there, clinging to that tree, waiting for the sun to rise.

And the other part?

It’s the one staring out the window right now… Watching the dark.

Listening.

I know it’s not over.

It waited once. It’ll wait again.

And next time, I might no longer have a tree to climb.
