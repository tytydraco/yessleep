Yesterday, I interviewed and watched the first live test of a man named Clyde. Clyde called himself a doctor, but had no official credentials. What he did have was a lot of money, and an obsession with quantum physics. 

He invited me, a self employed reporter, and science communicator to come see his latest project. I accepted his offer, gathered my gear, and drove to his remote lab in the mountains. 

The lab appeared as a lavish summer home any ultra wealthy man might buy or commission for himself. Three stories, nice brick work, too many windows, a pool, and all the amenities one could think of wanting. The only thing there wasn’t was staff. 

Clyde was waiting for me on the front porch to the estate when I arrived alone. I parked, reached to grab my equipment, and then found him opening the door for me. Despite feeling odd at the attentive forwardness, I thanked him, then followed him in at his request. He was a stockier man, looking to be in his early 40’s with grey speckled hair and goatee. He wore buttoned sweater vest over a turtle neck, and had thin lensed bifocals resting on his round nose. 

He addressed me by my full name, which told me he had researched me as I had him. I hadn’t given him my full name, or anything beyond my pen name. When he did so, he shook my hand, and I noticed his odd gloves. They were a navy, with intense geometric patterning. They were immensely cold to the touch, but not in any painful way. He smiled awkwardly at that, and apologized. 

He showed me inside, and treated me to a light brunch before showing me a few smaller demonstrations. It was at this point that I started the recording, and the following is a transcript of our conversation with provided context. 

Clyde: Are we recording?

Jenny(me): Yes, is that okay? I know this is just a few conceptual pieces, but I’d like to document this too for my transcribing later. 

Clyde: Yes, of course. That’s what we’re here for today, after all. Right, so, here I have a few things to help me explain what we’re doing here today. I’m sure you are, but are you familiar with quantum tunneling? 

Jenny: Yeah, it’s when something can slip through the empty space of atoms. 

Clyde: That’s not a terrible answer, but it’s less about atoms being empty space, and more about the method of moving. Let’s start here. 

Clyde walks to the kitchen, and grabs a piece of cheese from brunch and places it in an opaque box when he returns to the demonstration display. 

Clyde: Okay, let’s pretend it’s been a day or so. Is the cheese moldy? 

Jenny: Are we doing Schrödinger’s cat?

Clyde: Clyde’s cheese, but yes. Sorry, I do love playing ‘what’s in my pocket’ with these things. 

Jenny: Well teach, it’s in a super position, and is both until observed. Though I’d say it’s probably fine at the moment, and will be tomorrow. Maybe gross, but not moldy. Why are we talking superposition? 

Clyde: Particles are also in superposition. They have a wave form, and also have mass. They don’t settle anywhere until observed. 

Jenny: So, if they’re a wave, do they have different energy levels when observed? 

Clyde: You’re reading ahead of the class, if I may extend the metephor. You’re right though. Let’s do this example next. 

Clyde then showed a small shallow bin of water, with a wall separating the pool in two. He then took out a small metal cube. 

Clyde: Now, this isn’t quantum tunneling because we don’t have anything with wave form, but I am going to drop this and make waves so we have a visual. Of course, you know that what we’re actually seeing is just the waves pushing the wall to make waves on the other side. 

He dropped the cube during his sentence. The light splash made ripples in its side of the bin, and mostly were contained to its side. The ripples hitting the barrier made much smaller ripples on the opposite side of the bin. 

Clyde: These smaller waves are like the particles that quantum tunnel. Most of the waves bounce off, but some show up on the other side. Not all the energy made it through, only some. Just like in quantum tunneling. Except these waves of energy will never be mass. 

Jenny: And you have the opposite problem. You’re mass, and can’t be energy. Also, if you could have wave form, you don’t want to only have a little bit of you tunnel. 

Clyde: Both good observations, but I unfortunately don’t have a way to show you my solve for that first part. I can show you how I’m going to solve the second part here, however. 

Clyde then unscrewed a canister that began emitting heavy vapors. He reached in, and pulled out a puck patterned the same way as his gloves. He also retrieved the metal cube from the water. 

Clyde: This here (puck) is a super conductor, and it works best when it’s very cold. This one has been resting in liquid CO2 so it’s plenty cold. 

He placed the cube above it, and it began to float motionlessly above the super conductor. 

Clyde: This cube is magnetized, and is now quantum locked with the super conductor. If I push it, it will return to where it’s been locked. 

Clyde did so, and he could move the cube, but it shunted back to where he’d locked it the moment he let off the pressure. 

Clyde: My gloves, and the rest of the suit down in the lab are both super conductors, and quantum lock the very particles that make up my body so I’m primed for quantum tunneling, as soon as I have wave form. 

Jenny: That’s quite a claim. 

Clyde: That’s why you’re here, to see before you believe. 

The rest of the recording is me asking clarifying, and follow up questions, for example:

Jenny: Why wear the gloves now?

Clyde: Acclimation to the normally deadly cold takes time, and I don’t always want to wait to get hands on. So I wear these, and have a glove wall system to do smaller bits of work. 

Clyde showed me to the elevator where we rode down to the lab. It was subterranean, and was dedicated mostly to his work on quantum tunneling. The exceptions were the bathroom, and a photo developing darkroom. He said it was just convenient to have that hobby space down here as there were no windows, and light too effect photo development. 

The lab was cold enough that I could see our breath, but Clyde had a heavy coat ready for me on a coat rack. 

The lab has two main parts. The observation chamber, and the testing chamber. The observation chamber had monitors, seats, and a few hundred buttons. It was also the access to the bathroom, darkroom, and testing chamber via pressure lock in the large transparent wall. 

The testing chamber was a much larger room that had paneling of electro magnets set up like a U shaped track. There was a small, person sized capsule made of the patterned material quantum locked a bit off the ground at the start of the track. At the end was a sturdy looking wall, and a complex system of netting, and cushioning behind it. The testing chamber also had a small room in the corner where I could see the rest of Clyde’s patterned suit. It looked skin tight, and would likely only ever fit him. There were no mouth or eye holes in the mask. Lastly, there was a smaller, less convoluted monitor and control station. 

Clyde excused himself to prepare for the experiment, but before he did, he set me up at the monitors. He showed me how to use the intercom, but said once he was in a vacuum it wouldn't work. He also let me watch recordings of his previous experiments. He stepped into the test chamber, and into his changing room. 

I watched the videos he set for me, a small scale test where he got one particle to tunnel. Then a more impressive test of tunneling a coin. I was blown away, this alone was enough to shake the scientific world. When he stepped out in his geometric patterned suit, I gave him a bewildered look. Only a truly mad scientist wouldn’t be satisfied by this monumental achievement. 

Clyde pressed the intercom, and told me he was acclimating, and would start depressurizating the chamber while he did. He tossed out a joke about not wanting to catch fire from the air friction. He seemed as casual as ever about the situation. 

I sat down, and waited with worried anticipation. 

Before I knew it, he was giving me a thumbs up, and tapping at his terminal. Things began to hum around me as systems activated. 

Clyde vaulted up into his quantum locked capsule, and gave me a small wave before closing himself inside. 

On my monitor there was a count down from 20. I didn’t feel ready. Suddenly things were moving along so fast, I tried to catch my anxious breath. Was this crazy? Yes, but all science felt that way at times. Was this too crazy? He had seemed like he understood so much of what he was doing upstairs. 

6… 5… 4… 3… the screen counted, and I locked my attention quantum-like to the starting experiment. 2... 1…

The electromagnetic tiles flicked like hyper speed dominos, and the capsule rocketed at neck breaking speeds. It whipped around the bend faster than a blink would even allow me to miss. Clyde shot towards the wall, almost seeming to become a flash of light. 

The capsule slammed into the wall, sending shards, and debris scattering. After such speed of action, the crash seemed to be in slow motion. Chunks of failure, and disaster embedded themselves around the crash site. I screamed in horror, and shock while the entire lab shook. I’d just seen Clyde kill himself trying to quantum tunnel. 

I frantically rummaged through the terminal functions to pressurize the room, accidentally finding the light controls first. 

Eventually, I was able to hear the valves activate and waited anxiously for the room to be enterable. 

The test chamber was colder than ever when I finally made it through the pressure lock. The chilled artificial atmosphere felt sharp in my lungs. 

I ran to the crash site, and found the wreckage simultaneously resembling a stomped soda can and a dropped sheet of ice. However, I could find no blood, bone, or body. I couldn’t even find the suit. 

Confusion flooded me. 

I looked at the wall, it had held up to the force well enough to be standing. I saw nothing on the other side of it. 

I went back to the monitor and watched the crash again via the recording. He hadn’t just looked like a flash of light, he might have been light. Had he been successful in giving himself a wave form? 

I looked at the darkroom, and got an idea. 

I grabbed, and broke the coat rack to make a walking stick, then plunged myself into darkness via the terminal. 

I entered the photo development darkroom through the rotating cylindrical door. There was a dim red light within the chamber. I found a closed box with sheets of photo paper. I took a few out of the darkroom, and fumbled with my coatrack walking stick to the pressure lock. 

Back in the test chamber, I placed photo papers around the room. Maybe if he was a wave form, the photo paper would react to him. 

I let the papers expose for an hour before I couldn’t wait any longer in the darkness. I retrieved my photo paper, and brought them to the darkroom. There, one by one, I started using the premixed fluids to develop them. 

The first sheet remained white. 

The second sheet also failed to react to any light. 

The third showed no sign of anything. 

I began to doubt there was hope of learning anything, until I began developing my fourth sheet. Lines, and dark spots began to appear on the sheet. Incomprehensible, and unrecognizable to me in the dim light, but there was an image’s negative developing on the sheet. I finished the process, setting the image. 

I took it out to the observation chamber, and turned the light back on. I looked at the sheet. 

There on the paper was a contorted, mangled visage of Clyde. The difficult to make out details showed him elongated, warped, and suffering. If any human emotion was left to be read, it was of abject anguish. 

I’m a woman of the sciences, but I prayed in that moment that he would die and end his quantum suffering.
