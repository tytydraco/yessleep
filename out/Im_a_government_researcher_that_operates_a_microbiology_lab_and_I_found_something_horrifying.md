As a kid, I had always wanted to be a microbiologist. Ever since the day that I looked at some pond water under a microscope and saw all the little organisms swimming around, I knew exactly what I'd be doing for the rest of my life. But now... I'm starting to rethink things. Why would I abandon my lifelong passion? You'll see.

"Ma'am, can I go home now?"

Said Stacy, my research assistant. It was true, the work day was over, but I wasn't finished with my research sample and would rather finish it up before going home.

"Where's your enthusiasm? The Higher-ups said this was important."

She sighed, sitting back down at her desk. I could tell she didn't like me. I wasn't even sure if she liked microbiology all that much, and she certainly didn't like it as much as I did.

"Can you do me a favor and look at the sample for me? I have some work to review."

As I typed away on one of my latest reports, I thought about the sample. Not that many details were given, but one of those sketchy looking government guys brought it over and said that it was some "Very special water from a very special rock." Probably a meteorite. They'd done this before. In my 16 years of working here, I've gotten at least 30 different samples from water found inside of space objects. We never found anything of note. This was probably just going to be a waste of my time and another failure in the search for extraterrestrial life. But hey, at least I got paid for it.

To my suprise, Stacy called me over after a couple minutes.

"Holy shit... Ma'am, you need to see this!"

I got up, and I ran over. Had she really found some sort of life?

"What did you find?"

"I found... a planet."

"A what now?"

I bent over and looked through the eyepiece. Stacy was right. I saw what could be some sort of tiny planet- looking quite similar to ours, suspended in the water. It was neat, but there was no way it was what it appeared to be. We carefully moved the object into an electron microscope to see what it was made of. But to our horror, the image that came out was an image of a lake.

We examined it further. It defied everything I knew about science. How could something like this exist?  It was like all of the matter on that planet existed on an entirely different scale! And the planet was inhabited. Intelligent life. It had large sprawling cities full of intelligent beings living normal lives, seemingly unaffected and oblivious to the experiments we'd performed on them. When they looked up at the sky, they did not see us. It was as if some sort of elaborate illusion protected this anomaly from knowing that it was not in the vaccum of space, but instead in a droplet of water. I called my supervisors. They said they wouldn't announce it to the public yet, and launched a whole new research division dedicated to finding everything there is to know about these mini-planets. They made me the head of the division. Now I'm pretty rich, and about to become famous. The horrifying thing? They found more planets. A few of them are apparently "more advanced than ours" we could learn a thing or two from those. But the rest? Well...

Now that the mini-planets are "expendable", they're going to make me induce all kinds of horrible disasters onto them. Their excuse? "It could teach us how to react if they ever befell us." Bullshit. In  my months of observing these tiny organisms, I've seen them, live, love, laugh, and cry. I refuse to let billions of innocent lifeforms die horrible deaths. 

I devised a plan. I can't just run away with the planets, as they'd almost certainly find me, kill me, and take them back. But I know what billions of living things- even if they're tiny, are capable of doing. So with the help of the IT guy, I was able to create a device capable of tapping into the internet and social media of the first planet I had found. The original. Or should I say... your planet.

That's right. This post is not a story, it is a warning. Whoever you are, you are just a tiny little thing on a rock in a lab. With the push of a few buttons, you could be destroyed. Tell your government. And maybe... just maybe, you'll be able to find a way to make it out of this mess. I'll try to relay a similar message to the other planets, but I don't think I'll have enough time to save them all... goodbye.
