That fainting of the body didn’t last long. I was fully aware, more than before. Something had shifted inside me. The hitchhiker was no longer dominant. My mind felt as if it had staged a death, a quiet collapse meant to confuse whatever had been ruling it. For now, it worked. 

Meanwhile, I slowly began regaining control over myself. My body jerked involuntarily, my hands and legs numb and distant. Somewhere deep inside me, faint hums and echoes stirred, restless, indistinct, impossible to understand. The hitchhiker hadn’t left, but he was no longer in control. His presence lingered, subdued, buried beneath my thoughts.

The echoes felt like a distant voice asking the same question over and over again, frustrated, demanding answers. I knew what I had to do, I had to ignore it and get away from there. It felt like the only chance I had left. But my body was almost paralysed. I couldn’t feel my hands or legs, and I could only manage to tilt my head slightly. When I did, the sky came into view, and before anything else, I saw the shooting stars again, faint now, almost negligible. Barely visible. And I understood what that meant. Whatever was inside me wasn’t gone. It was waiting, submerged somewhere beneath thought, beneath language, slowly gathering itself.

I lay there for nearly half an hour before control returned in fragments. When I finally managed to sit up, my body obeyed me again, slowly, unsteadily. The echoes were still there, but weaker. The foreign language was gone, and my thoughts belonged to me once more. Still, something felt wrong. It was as if part of me remained chained deep within my own mind, tethered to something I could no longer see but could still feel. There was no injury on the back of my head, no blood, yet my brain insisted otherwise. A phantom pain pulsed there; crushing and unbearable, as if the blow had truly landed.

Ignoring it, I began walking toward the other side of the highway. The shooting stars appeared less frequently now. Along the road, I saw my car standing abandoned. I wanted nothing more than to sit inside it and drive away, but the tank was empty and useless. After several heavy steps, I sensed something behind me. A presence. When I turned slowly, I saw a faint trail of fog following at a distance, too thin... Almost transparent, just like the stars overhead. Alongside the fear came something else, grief. Heavy and unresolved. As if a part of me was mourning something I couldn’t remember losing.

The fog terrified me, and fear pushed adrenaline through my body. I forced myself to walk faster, but every mile or so my body failed me. I had to stop, or I would collapse. Each time, the fog followed. After several miles, I finally reached the main highway, the same one from which I had been diverted earlier. The moment I stepped onto it, the road behind me vanished. There were no barricades, no signs, nothing at all. Only the faint fog lingered behind me, and the stars were still there above.

My throat burned with thirst and my legs trembled beneath me. I stopped by the roadside and stretched out my thumb, waiting. Minutes passed before a truck approached. The driver kept switching between high and low beams, and with every flash it felt like waking up again and again, as if part of me were trapped in deep sleep and constantly disturbed by the light. He slowed down, lowered the window, raised an eyebrow, and asked, **"Yeah… where are we going?"** Before I could answer, something tore loose inside my head. It felt like a massive weight being pulled from my mind, as if space had suddenly been cleared. Memories surged violently and then vanished altogether.

and then I saw the hitchhiker leaving me and entering him. The fog thickened, the stars brightened, and the driver’s body jerked violently. His face twisted, his eyes rolling upward as something settled behind them. But as the hitchhiker left, I felt something else tear away too, something quieter, heavier. The echoes didn’t stop. They changed. My mind froze, my inner voice fell silent, and I couldn’t move or think. Only one memory remained, looping endlessly: the hitchhiker’s family, standing helpless as the two men approached, the axes rising, the realization, the screams. I watched it happen again and again as tears streamed down my face and breathing became impossible.

The looping didn't last longer, it came to a halt and was followed my an ominous weeping inside my head, it was a strong echo of someone crying, someone constantly crying within me.

Meanwhile I could feel a part of me alive somewhere else as well, somewhere I couldn't understand. Before I could reason without the situation, a voice echoed somewhere, somewhere my other self was present at...**"Yeah...Where are we going?"**
