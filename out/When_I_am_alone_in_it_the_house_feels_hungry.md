The front door closes.

I am alone.

The house is different when you're alone.

Loose, uninhibited. Like a cat with empty rooms for claws and sheets of glass for eyes. And behind those unbroken panes?

Me.

Outside, the house appears unchanged. Same brick. Same proportions.

Inside it is magnified—the hallway seems ever to stretch away from me as I walk down it—and distorted—and curve, decline, so that I am always a little lower than before, a little deeper under the ground.

And it is amplified, its acoustics boosted by the darkness, and if I’m the only one here, there’s more of it, more darkness because there is more space for it to fill.

I take a step.

The floorboards whine like tortured mice.

The furnace booms.

A metal passageway expands.

A car rolls slowly along the street, its headlights projecting fluid shadow monsters on the walls.

The cold autumn wind stops at the walls, but a new, interior, wind begins: warm, forced through vents. I feel as if I am in another biosphere.

I am aware of the ticking of all the clocks.

I am afraid to walk too close to the windows, afraid that in their rectangles of darkness—an unfamiliar face or figure may suddenly appear. A face or figure that is or isn't there. So I draw all the curtains, close all the blinds.

And now, blind to the outside, I wonder: is the outside even still there anymore?

I cannot risk to check.

I stay in my room, suspicious of the hall. In the hall, I am suspicious of all the rooms in which I'm not, in which nothing and nobody is. When the house is full, I trust the goings-on. When alone, when nothing's going on, I trust nothing: distrust everything. My reason is simple. In a house of people, all possible wickedness is human wickedness, but in a house devoid of humanity, there exists solely the potential for the inhuman wicked.

I check the rooms, one after the other, shining a flashlight into corners where the light seems to be consumed by the ravenous gloom. I yell—feel foolish—and yell again: “I know you're there. I know what's going on,” for it’s somehow better to let the evil know you know than to let it think it has caught you unaware.

Somewhere water drips.

The drops echo.

And stop.

Why?

I would shower but I cannot let the house operate under cover of the loud, rushing water. Besides, what if instead of water, blood shoots from the showerhead, if flesh slides down the walls, if these start closing in, what if the darkness invades and it becomes a solid bloody mass?

When I am alone in it the house feels hungry.

Eventually I sleep, but when I wake—when in the morning someone finally returns—I open the blinds, I let the sunlight in, but the physics feel wrong, artificial, as if the house has me and the world I knew digested: and regurgitated us into another, identical yet [false.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)
