When I was a teenager (single child), we’d moved houses to a new town. It was a regular suburb and my dad’s govt job had him working well into the morning. 

My mom and I were quite close, and she was incredibly loving and even more protective. It was a nice life, a slow one. With a normal schedule…early to bed, early to rise sort of routine. 

One night, I heard something move in my room. Freaked out, I flipped the lights on, sure enough there was nothing…I calmed down and tried going back to sleep…and in that twilight zone between sleep and dream, it spoke to me. 

It told me it was here to stay, that no one could free me, nothing, could save me. I started screaming, my mom rushed into my room and held me. I told her what happened and she calmed me down…my howling turned into soft whimpers, into a rhythmic pattern like a lullaby taking me back into sleep.

Then my eyes opened, I was alone in my room and I couldn’t move. It laughed as it said that it was too late. Nothing could save me. That my reality was over, and we were now in its reality. My screams were coming out as soft whimpers. My mom couldn’t hear me. I couldn’t move. 

Then the torture began. First it would scream when I tried to, and laugh that it could and I…couldn’t. Then it put me in an endless loop of dreams where I’d break free from its invisible grasp and run out of my room only to be back in my room, frozen, with my eyes open looking at my shut bedroom door in the dark, whimpering for mom, anyone, someone. Then it showed me dreams of my mom coming into the room, but it wasn’t really her. It was pretending to be her in these dreams, that weird grin, those dead eyes…and the moment I’d realise I’d be back, unable to move, staring at my door. 

If I could just roll out of my bed, maybe it would stop. “You can try…”, smug, and pure evil. 

And I did, only for it to laugh, only for it to be yet another cruel illusion. “I see what you see!”

I thought, maybe if I close my eyes, and do it blind. “Hmm…could work? Why don’t you try!” I heard its lips crack as its smile widened.

But, it did work. And It, did not like this. Screaming now, as if in despair and gleeful simultaneously, it bellowed, “What’s next? You can’t move! Will you crawl?” 

So, I did…but I opened my eyes to see where to go. And the moment I did, I was back in my bed.

I was trying to scream throughout, at this point I couldn’t hear my own whimpers over Its screaming and screeching. 

I rolled out of bed again, I crawled slowly…being able to move using only hands and feet in isolation. Everything from wrist to ankle was paralysed. I got to the door, my head hit it with a soft thump and somehow, my mom, my actual waking real life mom, heard it. 

I felt her hands under my arms, I felt being dragged into her room. It was screaming now like heavy machinery gone wrong, grating against itself, the whole house was shaking. 

My mom started reading verses, she didn’t know what else to do. Could she hear it too? “You think this will save your child?”

She didn’t stop. “I’ll go away, but I’ll be taking your child with me.” She didn’t stop, and suddenly I felt a million knives stabbing into my heart, as I convulsed and the ground beneath us began to crack and roar. My mom yelled out that Its tricks won’t fool her. She kept reading. 

As I lost consciousness from the pain, my body contorted into an unnatural form. Just before I lost all sense of what was happening, for a brief moment, I was outside our house, seeing it from above. I saw my dad pull into the drive way, his face concerned under the dim street lamp as he stepped out of his car…he was looking in shock at the house, which was violently shaking.

Then I woke up, once again. It was light out, I’d been sweating profusely. It felt like a bad dream, the worst I’d ever had…I gathered myself, sheepishly walked to my door trying to remember every detail to tell my parents.

As I stepped out of my room, I swear I heard It giggle.
