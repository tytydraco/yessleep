Jokes aside, I still feel victimised after the events of my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o37uyo/i_am_a_banisher_when_i_woke_up_i_wasnt_alone/). I think it’s becoming clearer, though.

All unknowns known to man have since the beginning of time been tightly tied to belief. Ever since the snails followed me home, I have been *very* creeped out by the idea of them doing something spooky. Like, for example, climbing on me. And my eyeballs. 

While they thankfully stayed out from my eyeholes, they *did* for some reason converge on me. This tells me two things.

First: The snails may be normal snails, but they are tethered to some belief anchor. I don’t know if the anchor is me, and that’s why I can’t feel the tethers, or if it’s the apartment. These tethers mean that fear and belief can affect the way the snails work and what they do to some extent, so I need to exercise some caution.

Secondly: There are, well, rules to what the snails can and cannot do. This means, for us, that we can probably define *exactly* what this snaunting is, and whether it’s tied to some known entity or event-type. I have already submitted a request and opened a ticket for this, so we’ll know soon hopefully.

I spent the entire day on this. Trying to *define*. Mostly because I reached my breaking point a few hours ago.

I was going to make some food. Humans need to eat, sooner or later, and I was pretty hungry. Food hasn’t really been a main concern of mine the last couple of days. 

I figured I needed something fast and delicious, so I opened my freezer to fetch some chicken nuggets to pop in the oven. When I opened the drawer, drumroll please? Snails. In my *freezer.* These weren’t moving, but I am not sure they were dead. Don’t know enough about snailology. 

No matter. There’s snails pretty much everywhere, so I guess inside the freezer wasn’t too surprising. That’s fine. Who needs nuggets when you can have a Swedish delicacy, canned fish? *Real* tasty on some rye. Yep. That’s good, let’s do that instead.

The pantry was just on the other side of the kitchen. I walked, I opened, the light turned on. 

Something felt *wrong.* 

The light flickered a few times, as if trembling. I looked at it.

For a moment, I thought it was just dusty. Then I noticed the smear.

Below the bulb, on the floor, right in front of my right foot on the linoleum, was a snail. It took a moment to compute that it didn’t look right, either. The cream coloured shell started on one end, then just… ended. Cleanly cut in half.

My eyes lifted back to the lightbulb, still flickering slightly. Suspended between the filament coils, the other half. And I swear it was still wiggling. That I could *smell* it cooking in the warmth.

Something inside my head just went *click* as I stood listening to my freezer hum behind me, taunting me. I decided, right then, that I was *done*. If the universe wanted to make me the snail man, *fine*. I’d take notes. I’d create the fucking field guide. 

I went to the closet and pulled out one of those big transparent plastic crates — the one that, at my place, usually holds Christmas decorations and youthful regret — and emptied the contents on the floor. Then, I started gathering. 

At first, it felt very manageable. A handful under the table, a cluster behind the toaster, a few bold explorers on the living room window. The longer I looked, though, the more there were. Every time I’d turn around, I’d spot another one. In the folds of a curtain, inside the kettle, on the wall, on the remote that had been empty a few seconds prior. It was as if they were appearing, right outside my field of vision, and just when I wasn’t looking. I counted out loud.

One. Two. Three. And so it continued. Each one, in the box. At some point I had to start repeating the current number out loud, and I was quite satisfied no one was here to see this. Twentyonetwentyonetwentyone….seventysixseventysixseventysix…

It took hours. My back ached, my socks were wet with sweat. When I could no longer find any more snails, I got another plastic box from the closet and moved them, recounting. When I finally sealed the box, there they were: a slow, writhing mountain of slime. A living, wet avalanche pressed against the plastic walls of their prison. 

It was ridiculous. Impossible. Also, a relief. Because now I had them. *All* of them. *Contained.*

The final number of the second count didn’t add up, not completely. It was only a believable handful off, though, so I’ll take what I get. 886. Almost a *thousand* fucking snails. 

I taped the box shut, tightly. Around and around the edges. Then, I went outside. Down the five flights of stairs, across the courtyard, then further away. My forearms ached. Across the small river. I don’t know if anyone saw me, but honestly I don’t care. Like I said, guess I’m the snail guy now. 

I ripped the tape off, carefully. The number of snails still *looked* the same. Then, I upended the whole wriggling, snaking mess onto the ground. Not carefully, to be honest. I think I even gave the box quite a few rough shakes to ensure they all were gone, hitting each other as they fell and landed with soft clicks. 

I double and triple checked the box, both before I went back and the entire *way* back. No snails appearing in the box. They were all in the grass, far enough away from the apartment that there was *no way* they could make it back in a reasonable amount of time. Not even if the fuckers grew wings and flew back, clumsily probably, as someone pointed out. Nope. No way.

When I made it back inside, sweating and aching but triumphant, I checked the apartment again. I found, well, none. 

I made a snail-less coffee, sat down and looked out the window by my table. My vision is definitely not 20-20, but I could see the pile in the distance. A brown spot on the ground, still so far away. It was probably wriggling, the snails figuring out what was going on, then going on their way. Wonderful.

Then, I saw *him*. The first snail I blotched, right underneath on my windowsill, just below my field of vision. He looked as curious as ever, slowly making his way to the window pane, as if trying to get outside. To join the pile.

After I noticed him (I decided to name him Skalman, by the way. “Shell-man”.), I found more. Whoop-de-fucking-doo. So much for my victory.

As the sanest person haunted by snails, I did the only logical thing: I repeated *all* the steps. Again. Walked around, collected snails until there were no more, then counted them. Ensured there were no more in the apartment. Dumped them outside.

I have two new findings: The number of snails goes down, each time. Not by the same amount, and not by a lot, but… definitely enough to count, I think. 

The first batch was 886, then it was 731, then 709, then 694. That… feels like some kind of success, does it not? It would be *the* most time consuming banishment ever, but if it works I am not above it. 

Now, to the second finding. The snail pile outside remains. They move, as snails do. Some of them, at least. A big batch of them stay, sticking to each other either flesh-to-flesh or shell-to-flesh or any mix of these. Like a grotesque snail-king, a colourful mix of shells and meat wriggling and exchanging slime with its neighbours and friends, where it’s no longer obvious where one snail begins and the others end. I’ve been trying to identify the splotched snails too, but I can’t find them in the pile, so it does seem the snails… well, disappear. To elsewhere. That tells me something is watching.

I feel bad for them. I think they’re just, snails. I am not sure they are capable of understanding what is going on, and that brings me some morbid sense of peace. It’s not fair, though. So, I am a little angry. About the snails. And whatever is doing this to them, and to me, it’s *playing* with us, and it scares me that I do not know what the end-game is here. Will I just be infinitely haunted by snails? Would they follow me elsewhere? Would they anchor to someone else, if I left? Would that escalate things?

Anyway. I made my rounds, refilled the salt. I don’t think it’s doing shit, but it feels comforting. I don’t even care that one of my neighbours saw me carrying it downstairs. I ensured all iron and charms were in their rightful place, the usual stuff. Also comforting. Then, I had to have a piss.

The bathroom still makes me feel a little icky. I am trying *very* hard to contextualise that the snails couldn’t possibly *fit* inside the shower head, nor reasonably through the mesh inside my faucet (I quadruple-checked it was still there). I double checked the toilet, too, just in case it were to be… full of them. I don’t know.

I turned the light on, did my business, and went to wash my hands. As you do. I checked the mesh again, and turned the water on. Splashed some on my face, trying to collect my thoughts. When I looked back up, two snails were sitting on the mirror, side by side. Close. Their heads were poking out, but they weren’t… moving. They usually move when the heads are out. 

Below them, my otherwise clean-enough mirror looked… smudged. A circular-like pattern, right below.

I used the flashlight on my phone to try and get a better view of the smudges among the dots of toothpaste and fingerprints.

It was slime. Dried, and tacky. Non-connecting lines, the thickness of snail flesh, loops and stops and spaces between the dirt.

I angled my phone. The glare slid, and the pattern shifted from nonsense to *almost*. A ring-like thing there, a clipped stem there. The two snails sat atop it all, heads still extended and perfectly still. Like little quotation marks, or eyes glistening. Waiting. 

I killed the bathroom light, kept only the torch. I don’t know why. At a shallow angle, the lines snapped into shapes my brain couldn’t ignore, built from fragments far within.

H… A broken ladder, arcs and stubs. Neat around the edges, as if someone had taken care to clean them.

Ä… Implied, its crossbar missing from its usual spot in the middle, the two stationary snails making up the two dots above. Holding their position, perfect spacing from both the upturned V and each other.

R… made of three hesitant hooks, the leg merely guessed at by a smear that faded, not as clean as the H.

HÄR.

Here. 

Here *where?*

I had leaned in without meaning to, my breath fogging around the word. The condensation bloomed softly, filled the gaps. The letters went from tentative to undeniable, alive for the length of a slow exhale. As the fog cleared, the letters faded again. I forced a deep exhale, made it reappear. The snails hadn’t moved. They were still looking at me.

I tried a photo. On the screen it just looked like a semi-dirty mirror and two neatly placed molluscs. I tried another with the flash; the flash washed the lines away completely, just created a big glare. In real life, they were still there. And *wrong*.

I wiped at it with paper. It just smeared the letters out, a shadow of the word still there. It reassembled as I blinked, the two snails scooting downward to keep the umlaut at the correct distance. 

The tap was still running. I could feel my heartbeat in my tongue. I forced myself to turn around, close my eyes, then focus them on my towel on the wall. Hard, until they watered. I wiped my eyes, and turned back.

The H had crept closer to the edge of the glass, and the snails remained. 

“Här,” I said, out loud, because it was too quiet. “Här *where*?”

The apartment didn’t answer. The pipes did, though, deep below and in the walls, with a soft gurgle. A satisfied one.

I left to get some glass cleaner and a rougher paper towel, determined. I was hoping the snails would be gone when I got back, and ideally the trail, too.

They weren’t. They sat exactly as left. I didn’t inspect the writing too closely. Instead, I reached my hand out to plop the two snails off.

The glass knocked. From the inside. 

Not a tap. A single, harsh and flat-boned *KLONK* that made my teeth vibrate. The mirror flexed a fraction, bent *outward*. It didn’t break. Both snails shook, but didn’t lose contact; their bodies flattened for an instant, as if they had been crushed perfectly flat by a palm, pinning them in place. For a fraction of a second, it looked like they were on the other side of the mirror.

I stumbled backwards into the tub, hip first, then shoulder. The shower curtain tried to strangle me on the way down. My phone clattered and spun, leaving the torch strobing across the ceiling in nauseating ellipses. 

Another knock, shallow. Shorter. Closer. Defiant. It had some *weight* to it.

The pipes answered with another swallow, soft. The room smelled again of wet moss and old coins and leaf mould with that *disgusting* sweet undertone of decay and earth. The same as the sink that first night.

I scrambled up a little, to see. The mirror surface wasn’t reflecting right. My face seemed to lag behind, my eyes weren’t aligned. It didn’t look like *my* face. The word had shifted. The H leaned, the R’s leg lengthened substantially. The umlaut dots trembled, their eyestalks pointed straight at me, perfectly parallel, perfectly still. 

Then, the handprint. Or, more like the *negative* of a handprint. Five ovals of cleaned glass, inside the silvering, the tarnish missing. It pressed and slid, moved slowly across the glass, like something learning to write. Or draw, maybe. *Feeling*. 

It crossed straight over the H, clearing its middle away. The “A” restitched itself around the clear. 

The third knock wasn’t as hard, yet a hairline crack spidered from the edge of the mirror. 

I reached for the snails again, because apparently my instincts had decided to go to bed for the night. My fingers were a few centimetres from the closer one when the glass pushed outward, towards my fingertips. The snail followed along on the ripple, touched me a fraction sooner than my brain expected. Behind it, a shape. A distortion. Not a face: a fist. It drew back, quickly.

I flinched before it hit. The KLONK this time was softer, almost polite, but it still rang down the metal rail into my spine, made my bones shiver. I went over properly, then. Elbow into porcelain, something *hot* sparking its way up my arm. The curtain rings screeched as I pulled on them with my whole body weight, making a hollow yet sharp sound as the plastic snapped.

My hand was in my pocket, clutching my charm. Hard. My eyes were closed. I was going through each prayer and chant I knew, fast, trying to *will* myself elsewhere. I was sure this was the end. 

It wasn’t.

When I got my breath back, and finally opened my eyes, the word was gone. The stains were still there, right around where it had been, as were the snails. They had moved a polite centimetre apart now. No longer aligned on a straight line. No longer dots of anything, no longer *belonging* to each other. Just snails on a mirror, chewing on the soap scum and toothpaste remnants. Innocently.

I didn’t touch them again. I stood very, very still, my arm aching and flashing hot, watching the mirror watch me. Or, watching myself watch me. It felt as if I was judging myself.

I decided that, for tonight, the cleaning can wait. There’s more snanalysis to do.
