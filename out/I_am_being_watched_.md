I haven't been comfortable for a while, which is ironic. I fled the cities to live remotely near Gustavus, Alaska. My goal was peaceful serenity, something I couldn't find in a crowd full of people. It drew me away from civilization into the stillness of the forest, where I had the same soundscape as another individual living 500 years prior. Now I am stuck here, and I long for those people I left; they were familiar, and at least I could imagine their intentions were similar to that of my own.

It started a few months ago, prior to the completion of my cabin. I went out one afternoon to finish hammering the shingles on my roof. There was plenty to do before it got cold, so I was working rather tirelessly, which is possibly why I didn't notice the noises at first. It wasn't until I took a break that I heard the sound of another hammer off in the distance. Its sound was concerning; my mind dreaded the idea of a neighbor, but I was curious, so I followed the audible trail. I walked for what felt like ages, but its volume remained consistent, and there was no indication of my proximity. "Curious," I thought to myself, and I retired my interest in whoever was nearby, turning back the way I came and keeping a steady pace so I wasn't stuck out there when night fell. The oddity of the darkness coming quickly didn't cross my thoughts, but now that I think back, I can't recall how long I was out there searching for that sourceless sound. On my way home, I had the strange sensation of being watched, and I hurried along because I feared there could be a large animal stalking my path. I wish now that it was an animal. My quick stride ceased as I heard the rustle of some "thing" in the tree directly above my stance. I slowly directed my gaze upwards so I could try to identify the creature contributing to the adrenaline surge in my veins. It was then that all the noise in that forest culminated and then stopped altogether. It was as though they all collectively feared the presence of whatever resided above. Not even the mosquitoes would buzz, and it was harrowing to think there was something in existence that would elicit such a response from every single entity near it. All animals have their life-threatening beasts, but even a butterfly would still land on the nose of a lion. 

I thought it'd be best to mimic an ignorantly calm behavior... maybe it would abandon a prizeless slaughter if I didn't give in to its clearly craved fear tactics. What's a hunt without a chase? I controlled my breath, ensuring it was steady and relaxed while my mind proceeded to be anything but. I could feel a monitoring spirit and almost submitted to my desire to flee helplessly but my idea seemed successful because the lively sounds returned, and I was able to continue back. Odd. When having the ability, that creature didn't pounce, which begs the question of its intention. The fear I felt within those moments ate up my mind to the point where I don't even remember the latter half of my walk home. I was relieved when I came upon the warm glow of my cabin, but being within the safety of my house didn't resolve anything... I still felt precarious. I was, however, grateful for the life I kept, and I was able to sleep, not peacefully, but at least with a somewhat sound mind. The weeks between that encounter and the next I would spend spiraling, but it wasn't caused by the occurrence in the woods. No, it all fell to shambles when I awoke the next morning. The day was absent of saturation, and even the sun's penetrative rays appeared dull and lifeless. It was the first time I had a disdain for being alone. When my head turned to find the window, a piercing pain went through my body as the two met. My window was old and had damage from the sun and rain, so it wasn't clearly visible, but through it all, I was able to make out a long branch-like hand slightly discolored to match the subfusc ambiance. My body froze, and the cryptic hand moved its fingers in a way that made it seem like it was... waving? What an oxymoronic act.

As I said earlier, there wouldn't be another true occurrence for a while, or at least that's what I have to tell myself; I believe I have driven myself mad over all this, and constantly being on edge will affect your sense of reality. 

To fight my plummeting mental state, I knew I needed some type of interaction, so I took my truck into town and excused it as being a trip to collect more supplies for a storage shed I was putting together. The town seemed emptier than usual. I mean, I know the individuals who reside here have similar motives to my own regarding lifestyle, but it truly felt like a ghost town. Pulling into the wood supply shop, I noticed the barrenness of the parking lot, and I couldn't help but feel worse about my situation. At this point, any human face would do. I went inside the store, thinking surely there were people who worked there, but to my dismay, there was still no one. The store felt cold and almost dry, being lit by iridescent lights—an absence of life... devoid of color. I got what I needed and went to purchase my supplies, but no one was at that tattered checkout counter, so I called out. "hello?" But the echo of my call was empty... there was no hope behind it. I knew I was alone, so I left cash on the counter and headed back to my car. I fumbled in my pocket for my keys, and as I did so, I got that old feeling again—the feeling I first had in the woods. I heard a faint voice cry, "Hello?" It sounded like my own... I had no intention of discovering its source this time, and I rushed my stride towards my car. I heard it again and could distinguish the distortions where it was trying to match my tone. I tried to remain calm, but my heart was leaping out of my chest. I jammed my keys into the lock and opened my truck, practically throwing myself into the driver's seat, locking my doors, and starting it up. I put it in gear and was about to take off when... well, that's when I saw it. 

I think describing it would be overwhelming, but I am going to do it because, at this point, I already know my fate. I am sitting alone in my cabin, trying to type this out for you, and I can already hear the knocks at my front door. Anyway, I saw it standing on the sidewalk outside the store. It had no expression on its face. It was long and wirey, and the face it possessed was humanlike but uncanny. It had pale, discolored skin, and behind the eyes, there was nothing. The hair it had was long, patchy, and wet-looking. It faced me, but I couldn't tell if it was looking at me. The body was twisted in a matter so strange it reaffirmed my suspicion of it not being entirely human. I really didn't know what it was, but it knew me and was clearly after me, so why hadn't it ended the chase? What was the motive? Why me? Where is everyone? The built-up fear was eating me alive as I knew my end would come soon, but I still had no idea of when. I know one typically plays with their dinner when it is plentiful, so it makes me wonder about the others in town. I drove back home, and it let me. I'm guessing I am one of the last ones, and I have come to a conclusion that I think explains everything. 

The thing, whatever it may be, has been stalking the town for months... it hasn't been on my case because I am a rare occurrence in that vicinity, but after the town went down in numbers, it ventured further. I know of its capability to mimic in order to lure you in, but since I live alone, it merely echoes me. It has had plenty to feast on, but as the days go on, it will eventually hunger once more. I have thought of leaving, but the day after I got back from town, a blizzard came in, trapping me in my cabin. So here I am, sitting at my computer, waiting... The knocks only get more demanding, and I'll eventually have to let it in. I long for those people I left.
