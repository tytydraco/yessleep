**I planned this to be a two-part story. Please comment whether you are interested in Part 2!**

It happened on an innocuous November morning. Leaves crackled under my boots. The mellow light of early dawn filtered through the trees, giddy with the vibrant hues of autumn. The chill in the air was crisp enough to tickle me through my sweater and keep me awake. 

  
I tried to enjoy the quiet beauty of the city. After all, I had gone on this walk to escape my dorm room, which was feeling more and more claustrophobic with every all-nighter I pulled. If only there was some sort of fog obscuring my picturesque surroundings to match the one in my mind. Then, at least, I’d have an excuse for feeling so forlorn when I was supposed to be studying at the college of my dreams.

I must not have been watching where I was going, for I brushed against a woman walking in the opposite direction. I opened my mouth to mutter an apology. She drifted out of my peripheral vision like a phantom, a few tendrils of familiar curly black hair ebbing behind her as she continued on her way. But that brief glimpse was enough.

My mouth clamped shut, and a bitter lump formed in my throat as my breath hitched. I told myself to turn around, just to take a closer look at that woman to confirm I was imagining things, but I could only stare straight ahead.

*Don’t be stupid. Of course, I'm seeing things after glaring at a textbook all night.*

But I couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was off as my feet continued shuffling forward.

*Maybe a coffee would make me feel better.*

I doubled back and headed to my favorite coffee shop- The Brazen Beans. To my relief, I didn’t encounter anyone else on my way there. 

As I stepped into the familiar cafe, I was startled to see someone sitting at the booth tucked away at the back of the shop, where I usually sat and kept my friend Agatha company as she finished up her morning shift. I noticed three things in the following order:

One. Agatha was talking to her, rambling on about the misfortunes of having a part-time job as if everything was normal.  
	

Two. Her order was the exact same as the one I got every morning- a cappuccino with extra milk foam and a drizzle of dark chocolate syrup.  


Three. She was staring right at me.  


Her eyes were the exact shade of warm brown as mine, but had a piercing intensity I could never muster. She had my strong jawline and cheekbones, but her pristine face lacked all the blemishes and acne scars I fought to cover up every morning. The suit she wore was impeccably smooth and she sat with the posture I could never hold for more than five minutes. She seemed older than me, but I couldn’t say for sure since her face was devoid of any wrinkles. She was *me*, but better in every way.  
	

Agatha glanced over to where I was standing; she gaped as recognition dawned in her eyes. Her eyes rapidly flickered between us. The woman stood up, gave her a polite smile, and began walking in my direction. For a moment, all I could do was stand there and marvel at her confident strides, the predatory glint in her eyes betraying the soothing warmth in her smile. Then, a single thought broke through the murky depths of my paralyzed mind- *Run*.  
	

And I did. I ran with the frantic desperation of a hunted animal, but only for a few seconds before I was tackled to the ground.

  
The impact of my back against the sidewalk knocked the wind out of me. I was pinned to the ground by arms that I would have recognized as my own if not for their lean muscle. The face leering from above me was *me*, but not the woman at the coffee shop. My efforts to fight back had no effect on her as she brought a powerful fist down on my head and my vision faded to black.  
	  
…  
  
I woke up bound to a wooden chair by pieces of coarse rope, my head throbbing and a warm nosebleed trickling over my lips. As my vision cleared, I saw seven of them surrounding me. All biologically identical to me, but so much *better*.  
	

“Isn’t this a bit dramatic?” One of them asked in a voice like velvet, her arms nonchalantly folded over her lab coat. “What use is tying her up for when we could have been done with it already?”  
	

“Quit worrying so much,” grinned the one who had tackled me earlier, her muscles flexing as she stretched against the wall. “Besides, we should get to have some fun our first time around.”  
	

“How sadistic.” The one scribbling rapidly in an embroidered pocket diary remarked. Her eyes snapped up to me and she blinked, as if broken from a trance. “She’s awake.”  
	

Six heads swiveled to stare at me in perfectly coordinated unison.
