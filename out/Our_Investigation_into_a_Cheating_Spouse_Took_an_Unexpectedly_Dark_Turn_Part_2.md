We stare at the gaping hole where the balcony doors once were, the shattered glass glittering like ice under the moonlight. 

"Mon Dieu, what was that?" Reine whispers, her voice a mix of fear and awe.

I shake my head, unable to formulate a rational explanation. "I don't know, but we need to move. Now."

There’s no time to waste; we need to act fast before the police arrive and questions start being asked—questions we can't afford to answer, at least not yet.

First, we slip on gloves and wipe down every surface we’ve touched, erasing our fingerprints from the glossy expanse of the door handle, the jagged edges of broken glass, and the sleek metal of the railing.

As Reine retrieves the spent shells, I focus on the bullets lodged in the floorboard. Using a pair of pliers, I carefully extract the still warm, deformed slugs. 

Next, we gather every shred of forensic evidence we can, working with the precision of surgeons. Every second counts, and as we hear the distant wail of police sirens drawing nearer, the urgency ratchets up.

We collect the fragments of what was left behind by the creature, using tweezers to place each macabre piece into small, sealable bags.

Reine quickly snaps photos of the crime scene, ensuring we have visual evidence of everything we've witnessed.

I spot Zane's phone discarded on a chair, the screen cracked but still glowing faintly. I snatch it up, knowing it could hold the key to understanding not just his infidelity, but possibly even the origins of the creature we just encountered.

Slipping through the service entrance, we make our escape just as the first police cruisers turn into the hotel driveway. The night swallows us whole, just another pair of shadows among many.

The drive back to the office is a silent one, both of us lost in our thoughts, trying to process the night's events.

The moment we step through the door of our office, Abbey looks up from her desk, her face lighting up. But her smile fades when she sees the grim expressions on our faces.

"Everything okay? Y’all look like you've both seen a ghost," Abbey says, her concern evident as she takes in our disheveled appearances.

Reine lets out a weary sigh. "Clear our schedule for the next few days," she tells her. "We've got a lot to sort through."

—

I head to my desk and pick up the phone. I dial Astrid's number. She answers on the second ring, her voice tinged with apprehension.

"Mrs. Everly, it's Ash. I... We need you to listen carefully," I begin, my words measured. “Zane... Something happened to Zane.” 

I explain, in broad strokes, the events at the hotel, carefully omitting the more horrifying details. Though I make it clear that Zane won't be coming home and that law enforcement will soon be in touch to provide her with more information.

Astrid's reaction comes as a mixture of shock and a strange, resigned calmness. The line is silent for a moment after I finish speaking; the only sound is her steady breathing.

"I... I don't know what to say. Is he...?" Her voice trails off, unable to finish the question.

"He's gone. I'm very sorry," I reply gently. There's a heaviness in my own voice.

Astrid takes a deep breath, a faint tremble detectable in her sigh. “Okay… What do we do next?”

"First things first, Mrs. Everly," I say, leaning back in my chair, my eyes tracing the grain of the wood on my desk as I gather my thoughts. "We're going to make sure you and the kids are safe. I recommend staying with someone you trust for the next few days, somewhere you feel secure. We'll handle everything from our end."

I can hear the hesitation in her voice. "But, what about... you? What will you do?”

“We’re working on gathering as much evidence as we can, piecing together what happened,” I assure her. “We’re going to do everything we can to get to the bottom of this.”

Her breath hitches slightly, and I can almost see her nodding on the other end of the line. "Okay, Detective Tran. I trust you. Please, just... find out what happened. And stay safe."

—

After the call with Astrid, we dive into the investigation's next phase.

The key, we hope, lies with Zane's phone. Cracked screen and all, it's potentially a window into the motives and means behind the horror we witnessed. The first hurdle, though, is gaining access to the device. With Zane’s… status, asking him for the passcode or facial recognition is a non-starter for obvious reasons.

That leaves us with the fingerprint sensor. It's a long shot, but it's all we have. We've lifted prints before, mostly from scenes less grisly than this, but the principle remains the same. With a bit of forensic delicacy, we manage to lift a clear thumbprint from the back of the phone—Zane's, no doubt, considering the placement and the repeated pattern of smudges.

Using a technique that's equal parts art and science, we transfer the print onto a thin layer of silicone. It's a bit of a MacGyver move, but desperation breeds innovation. Holding our breath, we press the silicone against the sensor. There's a tense moment, a heartbeat where nothing seems to happen, and then the phone unlocks, granting us access.

The phone's home screen greets us, a clutter of apps and notifications that hint at the double life Zane Everly had been living. As we sift through his messages and call logs, we stumble upon a series of texts between Zane and a woman named Chantrea. 

The exchanges are a damning chronicle of their affair, sprinkled with explicit photos that leave nothing to the imagination. The intimacy and frequency of their communication suggest this wasn't just a fleeting encounter; it was an ongoing, sordid affair.

Their texts suggest meetings that were carefully planned and executed with a level of secrecy you'd expect from someone with a lot to lose. They mention rendezvous at a place called "Serenity Touch," a massage parlor that, based on the reviews on Google Maps, offered services far beyond the typical spa menu. 

Delving deeper into the exchanges between Zane and Chantrea, we begin to notice a pattern of coded language peppered throughout their conversations. Phrases like "extended session" and "private therapy" recur, suggesting that their meetings involved more illicit activities. It became clear that Chantrea was likely a sex worker at Serenity Touch, the massage parlor doubling as a front for a brothel.

Chantrea's messages to Zane were laced with a mix of professional detachment and genuine emotion. It was evident she had developed feelings for him beyond their transactional relationship. She frequently inquired about his day, his thoughts, and, more pointedly, his family. Zane, for his part, navigated these questions with a calculated vagueness, sharing just enough to keep her engaged but always stopping short of revealing too much.

Among the flurry of texts, one conversation, in particular, catches our eye, a discussion that paints a clear picture of Zane's reckless pursuit of thrill at the expense of others' feelings.

In this exchange, Zane suggests introducing another worker from the parlor, Soriya, into their liaisons. His message is cavalier, treating the proposition as nothing more than a novel adventure to spice up their encounters. However, Chantrea's response is anything but enthusiastic. She reacts with a mix of hurt and indignation to a ménage à trois. She accuses Zane of diminishing what they had. Her threat to end their relationship over this is clear and unmistakable, leaving no room for misunderstanding.

The revelation of this discord adds another layer to the already complex narrative. Zane, in an attempt to mend fences and perhaps soothe his guilt, resorts to a classic, albeit clichéd, gesture—a bouquet of roses. His subsequent visit to the quaint flower shop, as captured by our surveillance, now takes on a new significance. It was an attempt at reconciliation, a plea for forgiveness wrapped in the delicate petals of flowers. 

The key to unraveling this tangled web, we decide, is Soriya. She's the missing link, a potential treasure trove of information on Chantrea, and possibly even insights into the otherworldly horror we encountered. 

But how do you approach a sex worker in a brothel-fronting massage parlor without alerting the entire operation or, worse, scaring her off? Badges and warrants aren't tools in our kit. We need finesse, subtlety, and a bit of creativity.

The neon sign of Serenity Touch flickers in the early evening dusk, casting an ethereal glow on the otherwise nondescript storefront nestled between a nail salon and a 24-hour diner. Its windows are darkly tinted, offering no glimpse of the activities within, a deliberate choice designed to preserve the anonymity of its clientele.

As I enter the establishment, the interior unfolds like a scene from a classic noir film—dimly lit, with soft, ambient music floating through the air. The decor leans heavily into Asian aesthetics, with bamboo plants strategically placed around the room, water features bubbling quietly in the background, and delicate paintings of serene landscapes adorning the walls. The air is scented with a blend of jasmine and sandalwood, a calming aroma that seems designed to soothe the senses and disarm any initial hesitations.

The camera, cleverly disguised as a button on my shirt, transmits live footage to Reine, who's stationed in our vehicle parked across the street. 

The receptionist, a woman with a calm demeanor and a welcoming smile, greets me. "Welcome to Serenity Touch. My name is Mai. How can I help you?"

I clear my throat, the words slightly catching as I try to adopt the persona we'd concocted on the drive over. My nervousness must be palpable, but just then, Reine's voice crackles softly in my earpiece, a steady whisper of encouragement. "Stick to the script. You've got this, mon amour."

Taking a deep breath, I meet Mai's gaze. "Hi, Mai. I'm, uh, sort of new to this kind of thing," I start, feigning embarrassment. “A friend recommended… He says y’all give great massages.” 

"Of course, we offer many types of massage—Swedish, deep tissue, aromatherapy… all very relaxing and good for stress," She lists off. "You look tired, maybe you try hot stone? Very popular and good for sore muscles."

"Actually, I was thinking of something perhaps more along the lines of a private therapy session," I venture, using the coded language Chantrea and Zane had employed in their texts. “You know, something more... personal?”

Mai's expression shifts subtly, her welcoming smile tempering into something more guarded, but still polite. Her eyes scrutinize me for any hint of duplicity. "You say your friend tell you about us?" she asks. “Who your friend?”

​​Mai's question catches me slightly off guard. I figure that Zane, with his double life, would likely have used a pseudonym during his visits here. I think back to Zane’s texts with Chantrea, remembering seeing him occasionally refer to himself as "Mr. Zen" in their conversations.  

"Yeah, Mr. Zen," I reply, maintaining my feigned casual tone but watching Mai closely for any sign of recognition. "You know, White dude, a bit taller than me, with light brown hair, always looks like he's headed to a business meeting.”

“You know Mr. Zen?” Mai hesitates, her eyes scanning me more intently now, as if trying to peel back the layers of my façade. She leans back slightly, arms crossing as she assesses the truth in my words. 

"She’s not buying it,” Reine murmurs through the earpiece. "You have to sound more convincing."

Feeling the pressure, I push a bit harder, the story pouring out more desperately now.

"Look, Mai," I start, my voice lowering to a conspiratorial whisper. "I'm gonna be honest with you. My marriage, it's... it's on the rocks. My wife has been my fucking case a lot lately. And to make matters worse, we haven't been... connected, you know, intimately, for months. I'm just looking for something to feel again, to bring back some... spark."

Mai looks at me, her face showing a hint of curiosity. "Oh, I see. You have big stress, huh?"

“You have no idea…” I say, sighing heavily. 

Mai glances around the softly lit lobby, ensuring no one else is within earshot. "Okay, listen carefully," she says, her voice low and urgent. "I can maybe help you, but we have to be very careful, okay? If police come here, I get in big trouble with my boss."

She locks onto me with an intensity that lets me know she’s more afraid of her boss than being raided by the police. 

"Look, I'm not a cop or anything," I assure her, my tone earnest. "I'm just a guy at the end of his rope, looking for some relief."

“Okay, I understand," Mai relents. She takes a deep breath, before reaching under the counter and pulling out a glossy brochure that she hands over to us with a flourish. "We offer very special session. Make you feel new love. Guarantee very happy ending. You interested?"

“Yes, very much," I reply, genuinely relieved. “Thank you.”

I follow Mai to a waiting room that is small and tastefully decorated, with a single plush chair and a small table adorned with magazines and a vase of fresh flowers. She gestures to the chair. 

"You take time. No rush," she tells me. "Each girl very skilled. You choose, then tell me. I make special arrangement for you."

Opening the brochure, I find myself looking at a series of suggestive yet tasteful photos of masseuses, each accompanied by a name and a brief description of their specialties. 

They all appear to be of Southeast Asian descent. As we flip through, I can't help but feel a pang of guilt, knowing that some of these women might not be here by choice.

As I continue flipping through the brochure, Reine's voice comes through the earpiece, her tone sharp. "Wait, go back a page. I think I saw her."

I thumb back to the previous page and my eyes immediately lock onto the photo of the woman. Her resemblance to the woman from the hotel is undeniable — the same high cheekbones, the same piercing gaze. Even her hair, neatly styled in the photo, matches the long, straight black hair we saw.

Under her photo, the blurb reads: "Soriya — a touch of mystique with every session. Trained in the ancient tantric arts, she will guide you to new realms of relaxation."

—

Mai leads me down a narrow, dimly lit corridor that twists and turns more than I'd expected, passing several closed doors where the muffled sounds of clients having sex can be heard. Finally, we stop at a door that's slightly ajar. Mai pushes it open, revealing a small room lit by soft, golden light that casts long shadows across the sparse furnishings.

The room is dominated by a large massage bed, draped in crisp white linens, and surrounded by candles that emit a soothing lavender scent. The air is warmer here, heavy with the scent of essential oils that mingle with the faint aroma of incense.

Mai gestures towards the massage bed with a small bow of her head. "You undress, please. Soriya, she join you soon, okay? You relax first." 

As I nod in understanding, Mai pulls a thick curtain across the doorway, enhancing the room's privacy before she exits. The sound of her footsteps fades quickly, leaving behind a silence that feels both serene and charged with anticipation.

After a short wait that felt longer due to the anticipation, the door curtain rustles slightly and Soriya enters the room. Her presence commands immediate attention. She wears a silk robe that clings delicately to her form, leaving very little to the imagination—a sheer, flowing garment that accentuates her slender figure. 

"Hey handsome, why your clothes still on?" she asks, her expression one of playful admonishment as she pouts seductively, her eyes scanning over me. "Massage cannot start until you take off."

"Hey, actually, I was hoping we could just talk for a bit," I say uncomfortably. 

She tilts her head slightly, a look of confusion briefly crossing her face before her professional smile returns. "Talk? Okay, we can talk later, but first, you shower. Make you feel more relax, yes?"

Soriya's hand is gentle yet firm as she takes my arm, guiding me towards a glass-enclosed shower at the corner of the room.

"You very tense," she observes, her fingers pressing expertly along my shoulders. "I help you relax first, then we talk."

She's graceful, almost cat-like as she leads me by the arm toward the shower area at the back of the room. Her touch is gentle, yet firm, a professional maneuver designed to ease clients into relaxation.

"You very tense," she observes, her fingers pressing expertly along my shoulders. "I help you relax first, then we talk."

Her hands move to the buttons of my shirt, intending to help me undress. I gently grasp her wrists, stopping her. "I’d really prefer it if we could start with a chat," I insist, trying to keep the situation under control.

I resist the pull slightly, halting her progress. "Actually, Soriya, I really need to talk now. It's important."

She looks at me, a hint of impatience flickering across her face before being quickly masked by her professional demeanor. "Okay, we talk. But why you so serious? You come here to relax, no?"

She pauses, a flicker of surprise in her eyes, but then nods, stepping back. "I understand. You nervous, I see. It okay," she says, her voice softening. 

Soriya takes a step back and starts to loosen the sash of her robe. "I show you first, so you more comfortable," she explains, her tone casual yet observing my reaction carefully. The silk robe slips from her shoulders, falling gracefully to the floor, revealing her lithe figure, causing me to falter for a moment.

But Reine’s voice crackling through the earpiece snaps me back. “Stay focused, Ash.”

"Soriya, I know about Chantrea," I start firmly. The mention of the name causes her demeanor to shift, a visible jolt of shock passing through her.

"Chantrea? What you know about my sister?" She asks nervously, pulling her robe back over herself.

"Chantrea’s your sister?" I ask, surprise evident in my voice. The pieces begin to click into place, but there's still so much we don't understand.

"Yes, she my sister. What you do to her?" Soriya's voice is tight, her body tensed as if ready to bolt at any moment.

"I didn't do anything to her," I clarify quickly, "but something... happened.”

I explain what we saw back at the hotel, keeping my tone even to avoid alarming her further.

Soriya’s eyes widen, her body tensing. “You show me proof? You have pictures?”

I nod. “I do, but they’re disturbing.”

“I don’t care. I need to see,” she insists, her voice firm despite her obvious anxiety.

I pull out my phone, hesitating for a moment before opening the gallery. I show her the gruesome scene you stumbled upon.

Soriya takes the device, her hands slightly shaking as she views the photos of Zane's mangled, headless body. She gasps, her face going pale at the sight of the chaos and carnage. "This... Chantrea do this?"

"It looks like it," I reply, watching her closely. "There was something unnatural about her, something I've never seen before. She... she wasn't normal."

Soriya looks up from the phone, her eyes haunted. “She promise she not do this…”

I lean forward, keeping my voice low and steady. "What did she promise you?” 

She hesitates, then sighs, a sound heavy with resignation. "Okay, I tell you. But not easy story."

I nod encouragingly, showing her it's okay to continue.

"We from poor village in Cambodia," Soriya starts, her eyes downcast. "Life very hard there. Our dad sick, need medicine, but medicine too expensive. Then, one day, men come. They say they have work for us in America. Say we make good money, send home for family."

Her voice falters, and it's clear the memories are painful. "Our mom, she not want us to go. She scared. But we need money for our dad. We think we do right thing."

"What happened when you arrived in America?" I prompt gently.

"Not like they say. They lie to us. They... they take us to place, lock us in room with many other girls. Beat us." The words come out in a rush, her face flush with the shame of recounting the ordeal. "They... they sell us. Sell first time to high bidder. After, force us work in sex work."

The story is all too familiar, a tragic narrative of exploitation that I've heard in different versions too many times. 

Soriya wipes a tear from her cheek. "It hard, but we try to make life better here. Chantrea, she always strong one. She say she make them pay for what they do to us."

I nod, my expression solemn as I urge Soriya to continue, recognizing the courage it takes to reveal such personal pain.

Her eyes darken with a fear. "She don’t tell me how. I think she just say to make me feel better. But then I find out."

"What did you find out?" I ask, encouraging her to disclose more.

"One night, I wake up, hear noise from next room. I look, see Chantrea with candles, strange symbols on floor. She chant, not sound like herself." Soriya's hands clench as she recalls the memory. 

"And did she tell you what she was doing?" I press gently, trying to piece together the events leading to the horror at the hotel.

Soriya nods, her eyes wide. "She say she do dark magic from old village legend. She say she want become something strong enough to take revenge… She want become Kamhoeng Slab."

"Kamhoeng Slab?" I query, struggling with the unfamiliar term.

Soriya struggles for a moment, trying to find the right words in English. She looks frustrated, then grabs my phone, quickly types something on it. I take the phone back and see that she has entered "Kamhoeng Slab" into Google Translate. The translation pops up as "Winged Wraith."

"'Winged Wraith,'" I read aloud, trying to grasp the significance. "Is that what she wanted to become?"

Soriya nods again, her eyes filled with fear. "Yeah. She believe only way to be strong enough to fight back. To protect us. I scared. I ask her stop. I make her promise to stop."

I pause, taking it all in. This was no ordinary case of trafficking or revenge; it was something far darker and more complex.

“I need you to trust me,” I tell Soriya, keeping my tone gentle. "I just want to help you and Chantrea."

Soriya bites her lip, her eyes darting around the dimly lit room, fear evident in her gaze. "I... I can’t. I don’t let you hurt her." Her voice cracks, the strain of loyalty and fear mixing palpably in the air.

"I just want to make sure no one else gets hurt, including Chantrea. Anything you tell us will be used to help her, not harm her," I assure her, hoping to ease her worries.

"What you want to know?" she asks.

"I need to know where she might go next. Who is she targeting?"

Soriya hesitates. "My sister, she... she say she find the big boss, the one who make us come here." She pauses, her voice barely a whisper. "She think to make him pay hardest. Make him example."

"The big boss?" I probe, my mind racing with the implications. "Do you know who he is?"

She nods reluctantly, her eyes darting towards the door as if expecting it to burst open at any moment. "His name Jimmy Inthavong. She say he... he worst one."

"Jimmy Inthavong," I repeat, recognizing the name immediately. He's the head of the White Lotus, a mid-tier criminal organization that's been on the radar for everything from illegal gambling rings to murders for hire. 

On the streets, he’s known as “the Shrike” because much like the bird, he has a penchant for impaling those who cross him on sharp objects as a warning to others.

"Do you know where she might find him?"

Soriya shakes her head, her fingers twisting a strand of her hair nervously. "No know exact. But she talk about place... a warehouse. Where they keep us when first come."

A warehouse could mean any number of locations in the city. "Do you know where this warehouse is?" I ask, hoping for a lead.

Soriya shrugs, a sign of her limited knowledge. "Somewhere north end of city. Near river. No sure. I only go there one time... too many bad memories."

"Thank you, Soriya. This has been very helpful,” I tell her.

Her eyes meet mine. "You really try to help us? Not just catch Chantrea?"

"Yes, I want to help both of you. I'll handle your sister’s situation carefully. I don't want to hurt her; we just want to stop her before things get worse," I reassure her, hoping to ease the burden she's been carrying.

She nods, giving a small, uncertain smile. "Okay, I trust you. Help Chantrea, please. No want her become monster."

"I will," I say, feeling the weight of that promise. 

—

Reine and I spend the next several hours piecing together the clues Soriya provided, cross-referencing everything from old case files to city planning records. We work well into the night, our office bathed in the soft glow of computer screens and the occasional flicker of streetlights from the window.

We start by pulling up all known addresses connected to Jimmy Inthavong and the White Lotus. We sift through heaps of digital breadcrumbs, ranging from property records to anonymous tips that had come in over the years. Each piece adds to the mosaic of the Shrike's operations but fails to pinpoint the current location.

Feeling a bit stumped, we decide to revisit the basics. We review hours of CCTV footage from cameras around suspected Lotus properties, looking for any unusual activity that might indicate the location of the warehouse Soriya mentioned. It's tedious work, but it pays off.

Around 2 AM, Reine catches a break. She notices a pattern of vehicles that seem to frequent a large, nondescript warehouse on the northern edge of the city, near the Industrial Canal. The area is mostly abandoned, filled with rundown buildings that scream 'perfect hideout.' It's a place we’ve checked before but not deeply enough.

"That’s got to be it," Reine says, pointing at the screen. "Look at the traffic there. It’s subtle, but consistent. And always at odd hours."

We cross-reference the property with recent purchases and leases, finally finding a match through a shell company known to be a front for Inthavong. It's not concrete proof, but it's enough to go on.

With a location pinned down, we prepare what might be the most dangerous part of our investigation. 

Reine calls in a few favors from contacts who can keep the police off our trail for a while. We don't need the added complication of explaining why we're there or what we're dealing with. Secrecy and speed are paramount.

We load up on equipment—more than the usual. We're not taking any chances. The arsenal in our trunk would make a small militia envious. We've got AR-15s, tactical vests studded with extra magazines, and a couple of Glock 19s with suppressors. Everything's laid out in the back of our SUV like a dealer's display at a gun show.

We throw in a bit of sage and salt for good measure. Reine says they’re good for warding off evil spirits according to Cajun myth. I’m skeptical, but I’ve seen enough tonight to entertain many possibilities.

The drive to the warehouse is tense. We go over the plan repeatedly. Infiltrate quietly and get to Chantrea before something regrettable happens. 

When we arrive, the place is more eerily quiet than expected. The moon casts long shadows over the cracked pavement, and the warehouse looms like a dormant beast. 

Using a set of bolt cutters, we cut through a chain-link gate and slip onto the grounds of the compound. 

Every shadow seems to twitch with the possibility of danger, a reminder that we’re walking into the lair of a monster.

Just before reaching the main entrance, Reine stops short, her hand shooting out to halt me. She points to something in the shadows. My eyes follow her gesture, and my stomach tightens as I discern what’s there. A body lies crumpled against the wall. Tattoos snake up the arms and across the exposed torso—clear gang identifiers that match the White Lotus’s known symbols. It’s one of Ithavong’s thugs. 

I approach slowly, my flashlight cutting a beam through the darkness to reveal the man’s neck ending in a bloody stump.

I scan the area and find his head a few feet away, eyes wide open in a silent scream, the terror of his last moments etched permanently into his features.

More bodies appear as we advance, each more gruesome than the last—heads, limbs, and other parts scattered haphazardly. 

We press on, guided by body parts like a macabre trail of breadcrumbs. The ground beneath our feet crunches with the occasional bone fragment as we move towards the warehouse, its large doors torn off their hinges.

As we close in on the warehouse, the atmosphere is punctuated by the sound of screams and sporadic gunfire. 

Inside, the air is thick with the smell of gunpowder, and ground streaked in blood. As we cautiously step through the threshold, the interior unfolds into a scene from a nightmare.

Chantrea, fully transformed, moves through the shadows with a terrifying grace. Her form is grotesque and magnificent, a malevolent blend of her human self and something far darker. Long, leathery wings protrude from her back, and her limbs have elongated, ending in talons that rend through flesh and bone with ease. Her eyes glow with a feral, otherworldly light.

Inthavong's men lie scattered in disarray, some still twitching in their final moments. Chantrea cuts through them with deadly precision, her movements neither hurried nor slow, but inevitable.

Their screams are interrupted by the wet sounds of tearing flesh and Chantrea's haunting wails.

At the far end of the warehouse, cowering behind a makeshift barricade of crates and barrels, is the Shrike. The gang leader's usual composure has dissolved into panic. He shouts orders that go unheeded, his men too scattered and frightened to mount any effective defense.

We’re powerless to do anything except find shelter behind an overturned table and bear witness to the unfolding carnage. 

As Chantrea advances towards him, Inthavong pulls out his Desert Eagle, his hands shaking as he fires desperately. The bullets cut through the air, but Chantrea dodges them effortlessly. She weaves through the air, her wings beating with a heavy, ominous thud that resonates through the property.

As the last of his pistol rounds click empty, Shrike's false bravado crumbles into raw desperation. "Please, please! Look, I got two hundred grands in that safe right there," he pleads, his voice breaking as he points frantically towards a heavy, iron safe in the corner. "It's all yours, girl, just let me go, alright?"

Chantrea pauses for a moment, her head tilting slightly, as if amused by Inthavong's pathetic attempt at bargaining for his life. 

There's a mocking glint in her glowing eyes, and the faintest hint of a smile curls the corner of her mouth. It's a sinister, unsettling gesture that chills the air between them.

With a swift, horrifying grace, she lunges forward, her arms wrapping around Inthavong in a grotesque embrace.

A sickening sound of tearing flesh and snapping bones echoes through my ears. Shrike's body torn in half, right down the center, his body splitting with sickening ease as if made of clay rather than bone and sinew. Blood splatters in an arc, painting a gruesome picture on the concrete floor.

As Chantrea's rage finds its terrifying crescendo, she tosses the two halves of his body in opposite directions with the indifference of a capricious child discarding a broken toy. 

The right half flies through the air, trailing a ribbon of entrails and blood, before slamming into a large shelving unit near us. The impact is thunderous, reverberating through the vast warehouse. It sends the heavy shelving teetering dangerously.

We barely have time to react. The shelving unit, overloaded with crates and metal tools, groans ominously, threatening to collapse. Reine grabs my arm, pulling me back just as the structure gives way, crashing down where we were crouched moments ago. Dust and debris fill the air, the crash masking our frantic movements as we scramble for new cover.

Our sudden, desperate dash does not go unnoticed. The disturbance catches Chantrea’s attention, her head swiveling towards us with unnerving speed. 

As the dust settles, we find ourselves barely a dozen yards from her, our position dangerously exposed. Chantrea’s eyes, glowing fiercely in the dim warehouse light, fixate on us with a predatory intensity.

Realizing the futility of standing our ground, I grab Reine's hand, squeezing it tightly. "Run!" I shout.
