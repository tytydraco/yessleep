I’m not exaggerating when I say it was the most bizarre experience of my life.

It started like any normal Tuesday. I woke up to my alarm blaring, groggy and irritated that I hadn’t had enough sleep. it was the same old routine.  It wasn’t until I arrived at the office that I first saw her. I was rushing through the lobby to the elevators, barely paying attention to the people around me, when I caught a glimpse of something in the corner of my eye.A woman, about my height, dressed in a black coat, standing in front of the elevator doors. Her hair was dark and sleek, like mine. For a split second, I thought I saw the reflection of my own face in her eyes. but then again how can i believe the eyes that haven’t had enough rest?


I brushed it off as a trick of the light, but when I stepped into the elevator, something gnawed at the back of my mind. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had just seen someone I knew—or rather, someone who knew me. The day proceeded normally. emails, meetings, the usual office grind. But it wasn’t until lunch that things took a strange turn. I was heading out to grab a sandwich when I saw her again. This time, I was walking past a cafe near the office when I saw her sitting by a coffee shop, staring out at the street. She was wearing the same coat, her hair the same dark shade as mine. For a moment, I stopped dead in my tracks. Was I looking at myself?
I quickly shook the thought off, telling myself it was just a weird coincidence. you know the feeling you get when you’re so sure someone’s looking at you? that’s what i felt. 
It was as if she was staring directly at me.
I spun around, but she was already gone.


That night, I went to meet some friends at a bar to shake off the strange feeling. They’d been asking me to come out for weeks, so I figured it’d be good to let off some steam. I arrived at the bar, trying to push everything out of my head. But when I walked in, everyone was already laughing and chatting. “You’re back already?” my friend Aaliyah asked, noticing me walk in. “I thought you just went to the bathroom a minute ago.”
I looked at her, confused. “What? No, I’ve been outside for a while, just walking down the street. I only just got here.”
Rachel raised an eyebrow. “Are you sure? You just disappeared for a few minutes and then came back. No one saw you leave. You’ve only been gone for about a minute.”
I stared at her, my stomach twisting into knots. The bathroom? That’s impossible. I hadn’t even gone to the bathroom. Had I?
I tried to laugh it off, but the uneasy feeling from the office lingered. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.


Later that evening, I went to the bar’s restroom to freshen up. When I looked into the mirror, I froze. I saw my reflection yes, but she was not me. The woman—me—was standing in the reflection, leaning against the sink, looking straight at me. This time, her face wasn’t just a vague impression of myself—it was an exact replica, down to every detail. But her eyes… they were empty. Hollow. I blinked, and she was gone. I quickly wiped my face with a paper towel and left the restroom, my hands shaking.
Back at the table, I could feel my anxiety rising. I tried to act normal, to join in the conversation, but everything felt wrong. Every time I looked around, i didn’t see her, but i sure felt her presence. i was starting to think i’m crazy. how can i possibly be afraid of myself?

“Hey, are you alright?” Aaliyah asked, noticing how tense I was.

I nodded, but then the weirdest thing happened.

From the corner of my eye, I saw her standing at the entrance to the bar,  peeking at me. she made sure to hide herself well. i could feel those hollow eyes stare at me.
I tried to tell myself it was just my mind playing tricks on me. Maybe I was too tired. Maybe the stress of work was getting to me. But something told me this wasn’t just fatigue. I told my friends i wasn’t keeping well and left early. as i went home, i rushed to the bathroom to freshen up so that i could go to sleep. i needed to get a nice 8 hour long sleep. i took a quick shower and went on to brush my teeth, as i looked into the mirror to ensure my teeth are clean, my heart dropped. I took a step back, my breath caught in my throat.
there she was again.

She was me.

And she wasn’t alone.

I barely had time to process that before the bathroom lights flickered.
And then, everything went dark.
I heard a voice in the darkness—her voice, or maybe my voice, I couldn’t tell anymore.
she didn’t sound human. i couldn’t understand the language she was speaking. or i was speaking. i don’t know anymore. 
suddenly, the lights flickered back on.
She was gone.
But I wasn’t alone. i looked back up again and In the mirror, standing right behind me, was another version of myself.

And this one was smiling.
