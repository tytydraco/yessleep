I've got a bit of a weird career, but it's lucrative.


People often get nostalgic over old shows from their childhood and want to watch them again. The problem with that is that most times shows from before the nineties aren't well archived. These days you can go on Amazon and buy a box set of your favorite show, but it wasn't always that easy. There are whole shows that exist in little more than clips and snippets now, and some shows that have been lost to time entirely. That's where people like me come in. We pick up VHS takes from yard sales and Goodwill and all over the place and see what's on them. Most of the time it's useless, but sometimes you luck out and find a show that someone recorded that turns out to be some of that lost media.


If it sounds tedious that's because it is.


If it doesn't sound lucrative, think again. I paid eight months of rent last year off lost episodes of a certain cartoon show that I found cassettes for at a church garage sale. I paid a good chunk of my student loans off with some early-run episodes of As The World Turns a few years ago. The money is there, you just have to be willing to look for it. 


That was how I found myself going through tapes at Goodwill on the day in question. I was looking for the usual stuff. Disney VHSs, old or obscure cartoons, and hand-labeled tapes from someone who decided to record their favorite show. Pickings were slim, and when I asked Doug, the guy who runs the Goodwill in my area, if he had any more, he got a funny look before nodding slowly. I donâ€™t think he knew what he had, not really.


That look was more akin to the look of getting two birds with one stone.


"Come with me, maybe you can help each other out."


He took me into the sorting area and into a storage room where he had six moldy old boxes that had been haphazardly filled with old VHSs.


"I can't sell them, and you're the only person who comes in who wants them. I was about to throw them away, but if you want to take them with you then you can pitch the ones you don't want. I'd rather have the storage space, personally."


I had to stop myself from salivating at the sight of all those tapes. What untold treasures might lie there? What lost media could I uncover on these? The possibilities were limitless, and I told him I'd take them.


"One thing," he said, bringing me up short before I noticed his grin, "You have to load them yourself."


He laughed when I went to the truck and came back with a handcart.


This wasn't my first rodeo.


I had them in the truck in two trips and paid him for the other box he had on the floor as a show of good faith.


I moved them into the house and prepared to start rummaging. I ordered some Chinese food from Dantes and got comfy, prepared for a long night of treasure hunting. As I popped the first one into the VCR I kept hooked to the living room set for just such an occasion, I just knew I was going to find something worthwhile here amongst these dusty old tapes.


Boy, I didn't know how right I was.


The VCR clicked and clacked before giving me nothing but static and the sound of plastic tape being eaten. I quickly shut it off, taking the tape out delicately as I fed the ribbon back in. This happened sometimes with older tapes, and as the spools reset I tried it again. The label said Jeopardy, but after pressing play delivered the same results twice more, I tossed it into a plastic bag I had set aside for just such an occasion and moved on to the next one. 


Not a great start but I was hoping to make up for it with the next one.


Five tapes later I had a recording of the news from October 5, 1983, some home movies of a trip to the seashore in which a woman and a dog ran along the beach, two tapes that contained popular episodes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and one of those old Disney specials that used to come on sometimes where they showcased the art process and upcoming projects. The two TMNT tapes went into the bag, they had cut the commercials and the episodes were popular ones you could find anywhere, along with the Disney presentation since it had no commercials and was also well documented. I saved the news broadcast, I had a guy who liked to collect those, and the home movies too for another guy who used them to make odd little art pieces online. 


Both tapes would probably net me less than twenty bucks so I knew I'd need to find more.


The next five were similar fare, and I added two more news broadcasts to the stack, a wedding video to a new stack, and two more broken tapes to the bag. The last of the two really stung because the label had read Jerry's Place, and that one was hard to come across after the accident at the studio during the second season. As such, any footage from Jerry's Place was worth cash money, and I dug it out after thinking about it so I could take it to Darrell and see if he could get anything from it. Darrell usually cleaned or fixed VHS film and his work was often worth the money.


The next four hours practically flew by as I watched tape after tape of home movies, cartoons, news broadcasts, game shows, and a thousand other things. Some of them I saved because they had shows I could sell. Some of them I saved because they had commercials that people would want clips of. Some of them I just saved because the footage would or could be used by someone to make something, and in this business, you never knew what somebody might pay for. For the most part, I only really ended up trashing the ones that didn't work, and I would have a full day of transferring some of these into a digital format so I could send them to people and assess their interest. 


As the first box came up empty, I put the bag of broken tapes into it and pulled over the second box.


Right on top of the stack, the label meticulously written, was a VHS labeled Christmas Morning. 


I picked it up and looked at it, sucking my teeth dubiously. The tape looked a little worse for wear, and it was missing one of the plastic glass windows that shows the reels. I wasn't sure it was going to work when I pushed it in, and when I hit play it made a crunchy sound that made me even less sure. I pulled it out, the tape trying to stay behind in the machine, and I figured the filament would break as I tried to put it to rights. It was a shame because kids opening gifts on Christmas morning was usually a favorite for creepy YouTube videos or adverts or other things. I wound it back up, slipping it into the VCR, and when I hit play, my expectations were very low.


When it played, I was pleasantly surprised.


As it continued to play, my surprise would become far less pleasant.       


The static parted begrudgingly and I could see a cheery living room with a Christmas tree and a floor full of presents. There was a happily crackling fire set behind the Christmas tree and the whole scene looked very picturesque. The date on the camera informed me it was December 25th, 1982, and it seemed from the noises behind the camera that someone was very excited. As the camera wiggled a little, I heard a small voice say "There, it's recording" before quieting down as a man came into view. He was clearly an adult, his head hidden unbelievingly by a swoop of thin blond hair, dressed in footy pajamas like a giant child. He had put on an approximation of a kid's voice, high and wavery, and skipped happily into the scene before landing with a wump on his butt amongst the presents.


"Oh, goody goody. Lots of pwesents for Biwwy!" he trumpeted.


I couldn't help but cringe a little at what I was seeing. He sounded like someone doing a bad Tweety Bird impression, and he looked up at the camera with a gap-toothed grin as if he were making eye contact with me. It was highly unsettling, and I glanced away until I heard the ripping of paper and the happy gabble of the "kid". It was pretty clear that he maybe wasn't all there, and I felt bad for being so uncomfortable as some parent recorded their "kids" Christmas morning. It was cringy, but I didn't think there was any harm in it.  


He unwrapped a large stuffed dog, the fur looking incredibly soft even through the screen and hugged it happily as he laughed.


"Awww, thank 'ou." he said, and that's when I heard something that made me hit rewind. 


I had to rewind three times before I figured out that it wasn't just a distortion, but once I heard it it was impossible to unhear. It was clearly someone making a weird muffled sound out of camera range, and it sounded hurt. It reminded me of someone crying out from another room, and I wished I could isolate it so I could be sure of the origin of the sound. The man child, Billy I guessed, was making so much noise over the stuffed dog that it was hard to tell, and when he grabbed up another present, I heard the sound again followed by a muffled hushing sound.


Something was off here, and it had me interested. 


It had never happened to me, but I had read some forum posts about people like me who had stumbled across odd, incriminating tapes. Sometimes it was CP or videos of murderers committing crimes, but the police usually paid money for these tapes. Sometimes certain collectors paid money for these tapes too. Either way, the date on the camera told me that the crime was long ago if it was a crime at all. I slid a fresh VHS into the other side, the side that recorded, and hit the red button. I'd just make a little copy in case I had to turn this one over to the cops.


Rent had to be paid, one way or another.


On-screen, the man-child had opened up a flashing police car, a large package of Hot Wheels, a few more plushies, and some books. He was ripping them open without any real joy but seemed to revel in showing them to whoever was off-screen as he thanked them for their gifts. I watched as the books went into the fire, the hardbacks blackening as the fire took them. Off-screen, I could still hear the uncomfortable noises of whoever was on the other side, and someone was clearly crying. Someone else was trying to shush them, to console them, but it wasn't working.


The man-child opened another gift and made a face as he discovered an expensive-looking package of make-up.


"Yuck! Who got me this girwy stuff?"


He threw it against the wall, breaking the package and scattering the contents across the floor.


He reached for another one, checking the label before throwing it against the wall still wrapped. He shook the next one before breaking it against the fireplace, spilling colorful clothes from a garment box. He unwrapped another one, finding a ceramic clown which also shattered against the fireplace. Clothes, make-up, jewelry, anything he didn't like seemed to find its way into the fire or against the wall and soon the ground was littered with glass and metal and bits of things. The man-child was gleefully flying a toy plane around, surveying his mess, before tossing it against the fireplace too, and crawling off camera as he laughed.


Someone screamed, the sound muffled, and he returned dragging a girl with him by the ankle.


She couldn't have been more than fifteen or sixteen and she was dressed in a nightgown that was now displaying an embarrassing amount of skin. She was bound and gagged, her hands tied behind her back cruelly, and as he loomed over her I saw him take a knife from the floor beside the fireplace. It was a big one, almost a sword, and I could hear other muffled cries and screams from beyond the camera lens. He smiled as she wriggled and squirmed and kicked, raising the knife high so she could see it.


"Time to unwap my weal pwesents," he said, the voice making it all the more horrific. 


I suspected that I knew what he intended to do with this girl, but as I reached for the button, it appeared I was wrong. He plunged the knife down into her throat, the girl bucking and shaking as he sliced it down. It split her chest, sliding between her breasts as it slid across her stomach and into her nethers. It slipped out of her wetly, and I could see red spreading over her nightgown. She was shaking in her death throes, and a woman could be seen dragging herself into view from off-screen. She was looking at the girl with teary eyes, trying to comfort her in the worst and last moments of her life, when the man struck again. 


The blade came down and she shuddered as he stabbed her again and again. The blood flew up to spatter the walls, sizzling into the fire as the woman bucked and shook her life away. The girl in the bloody nightgown was dead, her mother not far behind, and as he freed the blade, he looked back at whoever was left and grinned gleefully. The presents hadn't mattered at all to him. This was his gift, his Christmas Morning, and as he lept out of sight, the sounds of stabbing and tussling could be heard. Muffled screams and pleas for help could be heard behind the scenes. They were silenced just as fast, but not before they were scared indelibly onto my psyche. He spoke not a word, going straight to his work, filled his victims with holes, as the mother gave a final jerk.


I sat there, frozen, watching it all unfold. I was powerless to turn it off now. I had to know, had to see, had to understand why, but I would get no answers. I was as powerless as the people he was killing, and when he came back into view, I flinched in surprise.


He was naked now, his body painted in blood, and he smiled at his handiwork before turning to grab the tree. Like the Grinch had in the old storybook, he stuffed it up the chimney. He didn't get it far, but I didn't believe he was trying to go up with it. It got stuck halfway up, and the dry limbs began to burn. The fire crept over them, the broken garbage that had been the family's Christmas began to catch as well. As the house burned, he turned to the camera and winked luridly.


"Mewwy Cwistmas to aww, and to aww a good night."


Then he reached for the camera, and the video ended. 


I stood there staring at the static for a long time, almost expecting to see that blood, crazed face reflected behind me in the screen of my television.


After a while, I finally found the strength to grab my phone and call the police.


They took the tape, thanking me for my diligence, and saying if it helped in the apprehension of a criminal, they would see that I got a reward.


The other tape I burned in the barrel out back.


I didn't even want to touch it, but I wanted it in my house even less.


Now I'm sitting here watching the static, trying to figure out what to do. I have five more boxes of tapes to go through, but the thought of watching them terrifies me. Every time I reached for them, I remembered how he cut that girl open like Christmas paper and stabbed her mother to death while she died feet away.


How many more tapes like that might be waiting for me?


How many more Christmas Mornings might be invaded by that ghoul in the footy pajamas?


I don't know, but the more I think about it, the more I think it might be time to look for honest work.
