“Don’t drink the water of Wolf Creek on a full moon,” Katelyn ominously warned.  The bonfire popped and crackled, casting an eerie glow over her face.

Heather scoffed as she took a sip of her cheap beer. “Why the hell not?”

Katelyn sat back in her folding chair and crossed her legs. She too took a sip of her cheap beer, only communicating through her raised eyebrows.

“Oh c’mon, you’ve never heard of the Wolf Creek legend?” Brandon sneered, poking fun at his girlfriend.

“I- I have!” Heather replied defensively. “I just wasn’t paying attention…” she trailed off sheepishly.

“Wanna indulge the new kid?” Aidan asked as he curiously looked around the bonfire at the rest of us. There were seven of us there in total. Jack, Jonah, Brandon, Aiden, Heather, Katelyn, and I, Russell.

We were having a bonfire party, celebrating yet another successful high school football season.

“Legend has it,” Jonah began, creepily leaning towards the fire to aid in the spooky vibes, “if you drink the water on nights like tonight, a full moon, you’ll be cursed to turn into a werewolf!” Jonah then jumped up, in an attempt to scare us. “AWOOO!!!” He howled like an idiot.

“Bull shit!” Jack, Katelyn’s boyfriend, swore. He was already three beers deep. Tipsy at best, drunk at worst. “It’s not real!”

“That’s why it’s a legend, babe,” Katelyn talked down to her boyfriend like he was a toddler. Jack blew her off, opting to take another swig of his drink instead.

Aiden let out a disbelieving laugh. “That’s not even how you become a werewolf! Aren’t you supposed to get bit or be born with it?”

I shrugged my shoulders. “Wolf Creek is special. Apparently, the Native American tribe that lived here cursed the water in order to scare the white settlers away. Instead of wasting all that time pillaging and scalping, the tribe figured they’d get the newcomers to do the job for them.”

“As much of a good tale that is, it’s completely inaccurate,” Aiden said, finishing off the liquid in his red solo cup. He stood up from his foldable lawn chair. “I’ll be right back, got to use the loo.”

“The house is that way!” Katelyn yelled behind her, pointing to her house as Aidan disappeared behind the tree line a few yards away.

“This bathroom is closer!” His loud laugh rang out from behind the trees.

Katelyn rolled her eyes in annoyance. “God if my backyard starts to smell like piss, I’ll kill him!”

“What if he isn’t peeing,” Jonah giggled.

Katelyn leaned over and smacked him in the arm. “Ugh, don’t even go there, Jonah!”

“I don’t care if the story is inaccurate to the myth,” I lamented, staring up at the moon. The clouds had moved, revealing the celestial being in its full, glowing, beauty. “I love folklore and legends. The history behind them is always so interesting.”

“God,” Heather drunkenly snorted, “You’re such a nerd Russell! Remind me again why you’re part of the friend group?”

I was about to reply with a witty retort, but the vibes of the party were thrown off by a sudden, blood-curdling scream, filling the air. The sound startled us all sober. We sat there, quietly listening for it to happen again. When it did, we knew it was coming from the woods behind Katelyn’s house. The woods Aidan were in…

“What the hell? Is that- is that Aidan?” Jonah asked, concerned.

“Someone should go check on him!” Katelyn cried, grabbing on to Jack’s arm.

Wanting to seem brave and impress his girl, Jack stood up and volunteered, “I’ll go.”

“Be careful!” Heather whined as Jack cautiously walked past the tree-line.

“I was totally going to go,” Brandon started, shifting in his chair, “but he volunteered.”

We all rolled our eyes. For the big guy that Brandon was, he had to be the biggest coward in the group. It didn’t matter much though, Jack was definitely the strongest out of all of us and the best equipped to handle the situation. Jack was the team’s quarterback.

Brandon was the offensive lineman, Jonah was our fullback, Aiden was the wide receiver, and I was a linebacker. Katelyn and Heather were our strongest cheerleaders.

We all watched for Jack eagerly, Aidan’s screams having stopped for the moment. An unsettling feeling fell over the rest of the group.

“What do you think it was?” Heather asked Brandon.

“I dunno. New kid is probably just dicking around with us,” Brandon responded.

Katelyn pressed her lips into a thin line, not sure what to think on the matter.

Jonah shifted in his seat nervously. “Those screams sounded pretty genuine to me…”

“I just hope he’s okay,” I added.

Jack then re-emerged from the woods. He was slowly backing up. We all looked at him confused, unable to see what he did.

“What is he doing?” Katelyn asked herself.

Suddenly, Jack’s eyes widened. He turned and started running. “RUN!” He yelled, pointing to Katelyn’s house, “Get inside, now!”

Immediately after, this massive gray wolf jumped out of the tree-line, chasing Jack. It looked mean and angry.

“Holy shit!” Jonah yelled, knocking his chair over as he frantically stood up, spilling his bottle of beer in the process. He lost his balance and tripped over the chair. I raced to help him up.

“That’s a fucking wolf!” Brandon shouted, scurrying away from the fire.

“Thanks a lot Captain Obvious!” Heather said, pushing Katelyn out of her way as she ran for safety.

An offended scowl appeared on Katelyn’s face. “Ow! You fucking bitch!”

“Sorry babe! Survival of the fittest!” She shouted behind her, managing to flick a lock of her long dirty blonde hair behind her in the process.

After getting Jonah steadied on his feet, I caught Katelyn before she fell too. Jonah took off as we started running back to the house together.

I looked back to see Jack barely managing to catch up with us. He had just veered to the left, coming up the small hill where Katelyn’s fire pit sat.

He went flying, the wind getting knocked out of him as the wolf caught up and pounced on him. The velocity caused him to crash right next to the fire pit, the wolf landing a few feet away from him. Jack let out a pained groan as he quickly picked himself up.

Katelyn and I stopped. “Jack!” She worriedly cried out to her lover.

Jack didn’t have too much time to recover as the wolf shook off the landing and quickly pounced again. This time, Jack stumbled over Jonah’s overturned yard chair. His unbalanced equilibrium had caused him to stumble forward, falling face first into the roaring bon fire.

His screams of agony filled the night sky as his flesh was quickly singed by the hot flames. Jack flailed frantically, burning his hands on sizzling wood as he struggled to free himself out of the fire pit. To add insult to injury, the wolf pounced on him one final time. The creature snarled as it began clawing at Jack’s back, effectively tearing him to shreds. Skin, muscle, and sinew flew everywhere as the aroma of burning hair and flesh reached us.

A visceral cry left Katelyn’s mouth as she watched Jack’s movements come to a halt. His screams dimmed before stopping entirely, the only sounds left being the crackling of the fire and the wolf munching on his charred remains.

Katelyn tried to run to him, but I quickly grabbed her wrist, preventing her from getting herself killed.

“Leave him!” I pleaded. “He’s gone!”

Reluctantly, Katelyn followed the rest of us back to the house, wiping stray tears off her cheeks as we ran.

“Hurry, hurry, hurry! Get in while it’s still distracted!” Jonah ushered us in through the glass back doors one by one.

“What *the* Hell!” Heather’s breath shuddered as she tried to steady herself.

“W-what do we do?” Katelyn asked, panicked.

“Call the police, duh!” Brandon said, pulling out his phone.

“No, we should call animal control,” I countered.

“Does it really matter?! We need to call someone! Anyone!” Heather said.

Heather and Jonah were standing by the door, staring in horrified awe at the wolf. Jonah squinted out the glass before quickly walking away from it. “We’re safe in here, right?”

“We should be,” Katelyn reassured him. “Heather, get away from the windows, just in case.”

“Why?” She scoffed. “Since when did wolves evolve opposable thumbs and can open doors?

“Heather,” Jonah warned.

Heather didn’t falter, turning to face the rest of us as she leaned against the back doors, defiantly crossing her arms into her chest. “Relax guys, I’ll be fine.”

*Thump!*

“Oh god!” Heather startled, jumping off the doors. “It’s the wolf!”

*Thump! Thump, thump!*

“The glass should hold,” Katelyn said wearily, taking a step back.

Another thump on the glass rang out as the wolf charged once more. This time the glass panes cracked against the wolf’s brute force. It was hell bent on getting in the house.

“Get away from the window, Heather!” Brandon screamed. His words didn’t seem to reach her. She stood there, frozen in place, staring out the glass.

Glass exploded everywhere as the wolf succeeded in crashing through the doors.

“Ahhhhh!” Heather screamed. Glass shards pierced the skin on her hands, arms, and face. A sickening crack filled the air as her skull bashed against the wall. The wolf had collided with her, the wild animal’s momentum throwing her back against it.

Blood poured down the side of her split open head, her blonde hair matting and turning a crimson shade of red. Heather slumped down to the ground, leaning against the wall. Whimpers and shallow cries left her mouth as she tried to look beside her, trying to get a location on the wolf.

“N-nice doggy!” She whispered, finding the wolf looking her dead in the eyes. The creature licked its lips before releasing a guttural snarl. It then brutally sunk its teeth into Heather’s throat, ripping it out in one giant bite. Her body writhed as a muffled cry left what was left of her throat.

Heather laid there powerless to stop her death, gurgling and chocking on her own blood. Her blue eyes quickly faded to a dull shade of gray as the life drained from them. The wolf greedily lapped up the pool of blood the mangled, broken, and glass riddled cheerleader left behind.

“C-call- call the police!” Katelyn began hitting Brandon frantically, trying to get him to move faster than he already was. “Hurry!”

“I am!”Brandon shouted, dialing the emergency line.

“It got Jack and Heather!” Katelyn sobbed.

I looked at the wolf as it feasted upon Heather’s remains. The light from the moon illuminating the gruesome sight for everyone to see. “God damn, it probably got Aidan too…”

The wolf suddenly stopped what it was doing, letting out a slight whine. At the same time, the moonlight that had been shining in through the broken glass door dimmed significantly. The clouds had moved again, covering up the moon.

“What the hell?!” I commented as cracks and pops filled the hallway. The wolf began to jerk randomly, huffing and groaning in pain as its bones seemed to shift beneath its fur. But then there was no fur, just gray hairless skin. The wolf kept morphing, its skin growing pink as joints and sockets snapped and fell into place.

Brandon started to gag. “Ugh, I think I’m going to be sick!”

Katelyn covered her mouth with both hands, not knowing if she was keeping puke or a scream in. A sense of vertigo overcame Jonah. He propped himself up against the wall to keep himself upright.

In a matter of a minute the wolf was no more, in its place a human man.

“911 what’s your emergency? Hello? Hello?! Is anyone there?” An impatient voice from Brandon’s phone asked, bringing some of us back to reality. Nobody was able to answer though. We just stood there, speechless, looking at the once wolf, turned man, standing in front of us. He was naked and covered in Jack and Heather’s blood. “These fucking kids man, I swear,” the operator angrily sighed before hanging up.

“The wolf didn’t get me… I *am* the wolf,” Aidan grunted out menacingly in a gruff voice, wiping blood off the side of his mouth as he stood to his feet.
