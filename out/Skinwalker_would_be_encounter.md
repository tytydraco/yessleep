I don’t write scary stories, and I don’t normally live any. This was a weird thing that happened, and the title is the only explanation we could come with. But it is really what happened, and I want you to come with your conclusions.

Me, my boyfriend, and 7 other friends decided to go a bit north of Austin, Texas, to float on the river. We went off season, but there was some festival going on, so it was still busy. We got an Airbnb. 

Day one, we play card games and get drunk.

Day two, we spend the day floating around on the river, and go back to the Airbnb, all tired. Everyone goes to bed. Except me and Tanya. 

Small house. Upstairs has a large balcony facing the river. No houses close by. A camping area is the next “neighbor”, empty for the season.  Lots of trees. 

Anyway…

Well, everyone is sleeping, but Tanya and I, and my dog, we’re are drinking on this balcony upstairs. We hear a scream “help”… sounds low, sounded like a girl, coming from the woods by the river. I scream back “hello??”. We hear it again “HELP”, now a bit louder. Tanya also scream back at that time, standing up now “HELLO?? You need help??”. Then nothing. We talk about it for a min… like, who says help and then shuts up?? That’s just weird. My dog wakes up, I think she wants to potty. I go downstairs with her, Tanya is weirded out, but decides to follow us… it’s quiet.

We go downstairs, I walk Margaret (my dog) close to the river, but not too close, she’s a bit upset, and leads me back to the house. Downstairs door was unlocked. We walk in, leave Margs in the room with my bf, and go back upstairs to the balcony.

We then hear again, louder, “HELP” at this point, I’m lowkey annoyed. I yell back “WTF? Do you need medical, police or firefighters?” Then again, louder, “HELP”! Us: “where are you??” Tanya is staring at me. I’m worried that’s someone trying to rob us, I yell back “I HAVE MORE EFFING GUNS THAN YOU CAN COUNT! And if you come mess with me, I’ll make sure to use them!!”

Then “HELP” again, and me “COME AND TRY!” I was scared, Tanya was scared. I was talking shit. At this point, Tanya and I held hands and said a prayer.

After that, Im  like “Tanya, I actually feel like I need to grab a gun now, idk if there’s actually someone out there.” So my dumb ass, leaves Tanya alone, well, at this point Leah woke up, and went to the balcony to check on us. So I leave them there, and go downstairs and wake up my bf “hey, nothing to worry, but I need the car keys, so I can grab the Glock in the truck.”… of course now he wakes up and is worried (my dog, somehow, still asleep. Btw she’s deaf, so that’s probably why,). 

Bf and I go back upstairs to his truck and grab the gun. We go back to the balcony. Tanya and Leah are pale AF. Tanya and I tell my bf and Leah what happened before. Leah and Tanya tell us while I was gone, they still heard it “HELP”multiple times. It stopped the second my bf and I walked to the balcony.

My bf, did believe us, but just left the gun with me, went back to bed. Me, Tanya and Leah stayed out there for another hour or so. But no more screams. We couldn’t understand, if someone needed help, and was able to scream HELP, why they wouldn’t reply when we asked where they were??

We all went to sleep.

Next morning, We told the rest of the group about it. That’s when the skinwalker theory came in. Idk what it actually was. But that’s really the most likely scenario.

Btw, Tanya and mine original plan was to get the gun, and go look for the source of the screaming. My bf and Leah told us that was the most ridiculous idea they ever heard. I’m glad they didn’t let us go through with that plan.
