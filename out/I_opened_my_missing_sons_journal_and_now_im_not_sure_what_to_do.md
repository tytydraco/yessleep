A few years ago my son went missing, and our family is broken because of it. We haven't had enough emotional strength to go through his room until now because we had hoped he was still alive, but I doubt it. I found his journal under his bed with dust piled on top. I decided to look through and read some pages and I found one that said, "Today when I was cleaning out my closet I tripped and I fell into this weird place. It's not my home but I recognize it. It has moldy carpet and old walls. It seems endless.. I don’t know how to get out. I’ve been walking around for a while now and I keep hearing things, like whispers, but it’s not coming from people I know that much. I found a ladder, maybe I can get out of here!

I’m not out.. It looks like a child's party, but it’s empty.. I found a child's toy. I'll take it with me. Maybe it’s useful? I see creatures holding balloons but their faces look like smiley faces. I’m hiding from one right now.. It chased me. I’m scared of what to do now.

I’m safe now I found an exit. I’m not out yet but this place looks safer, it’s a house. Hello kitty items are everywhere and its walls are a baby pink. I see something.. It’s a tall shadow.. I’m scared. How do I get out of this house? I see no exits here, I’ve looked in every nook and cranny.

The shadow creature saw my struggle and pointed to a cute item, I handed it to them and now I’m at an old bookstore area. There is a sign saying “the end” Maybe I've made it out! It lied… I can’t exit this place, I don’t know how. Maybe I should have stayed at the pink house. I see a smiling face but no head or body.. It’s staring at me.. I have to run!!!

I Ran and tripped again, I’m in this hallway with red lights.. there are things behind me.. Now I really have to run.

I made it out of the red hallway but it's hard to breathe. I’m gonna rest for a while..

I’m back.. I’m home.. But I was just there.. I know it was real. The proof is in this book, but my family doesn't believe me.. My parents asked where I had gone for the past 2 days. I keep telling them what happened was real but they think I'm crazy.. I don’t know what I'm supposed to do now.."

The thing is, he went missing for 2 days once and came back a little mentally unstable, then a week after that event he went missing again, but the second time it was for good. I'm not sure what to do now...Do I tell my wife? Do I call the police? Or do I just burn the page and forget I saw it...?

Update 1: I'm going to search the closet, I'm taking my phone, my charger, an emergency kit, my gun, as much ammo as I can find, and other things to survive. Whatever he saw it seems dangerous and I need to be prepared, I'll update as soon as I can.

Update 2: I told my wife about what I was doing, she said I sound crazy but I don't care. I need to find my son. I'm gonna try to clean my sons closet, maybe that's how I get in.

Update 3: I've fallen into this area, just as described in the journal. It's endless hallways with old wallpaper and moldy carpet. The smell is horrific, it smells like blood and mold. I'm also hearing whispers just like the journal said. I can't believe I thought he was lying, I should have believed him. Maybe if I did he wouldn't have gone missing...

Update 4: Sorry for not updating in a few hours, I've been trying to find somewhere safer. I'm in a place that wasn't described in the journal, it's an area full of pools and water. The stench of chlorine is nauseating. I feel completely alone here, I don't think anything living is here. I'll update again soon.

Update 5: I've been going in and out of different areas in this place, it seems completely endless. I came down here to find my missing son but now what if I'm the one that's missing now?
