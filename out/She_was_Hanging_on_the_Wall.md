I’m a collector of oddities. Artifacts with haunted histories, murmurs of the paranormal. It’s all for my podcast, what I do for a living, what pays for my home and my family. So, imagine my thrill when I acquired a rare original pressing of *Szomorú vasárnap* — *Gloomy Sunday*. It’s a sorrow-soaked lullaby steeped in death and despair. Its minor-key piano melody and mournful lyrics conjure a sense of profound hopelessness, almost as if the song itself breathes with grief.

Over time, it gained a reputation not just as music, but as a kind of cursed relic. Legends claim it drove listeners to take their own lives, earning it the name “The Hungarian Death Song.” Perfect for my show. I couldn’t wait to listen to it… but someone else heard it first… and invited whatever followed.

I live with two.  
My wife — a grounded, skeptical woman who rolls her eyes at ghost stories.  
And my daughter — bright, curious, always eager to explore the unknown.

My wife, while not disliking my lifestyle, has always been dismissive of the mystical aspects about what I bring in. This time was no different.

“This song’s cursed?” my wife mocked. “Please. People don’t end things because of music. Just superstition.”

Our daughter, on the other hand, was always enthusiastic about my profession, excited for what I was delving into next. They say the young are more in tune with these sorts of things. Now more than ever, I wish that wasn’t the case.

Someone played it.  
I heard the song drifting from my recording room… only the end, like the last breath of a dying fire. I rushed in. The room was empty. The record player was still spinning. The needle hovered in the air… as if it had just finished whispering to someone.

I wasn’t distressed that it would curse one of them—that was the last thing on my mind. More so, anger swelled in me. It’s a fragile, irreplaceable artifact. It needs to be handled with care.

I questioned them both.  
Denials. Flat and cold.  
I suspected my daughter.  
My wife would have no reason to go through with this. At the time, it made sense.

In the days that followed… my daughter dimmed.  
Where once she was sunlight, full of life—now she was shadow and silence, someone I hardly recognized.

She shut herself away.  
Snapped at me, like I was the cause of her suffering.  
My wife told me to let her be. Said it was natural.

“Girls tend to act like that sometimes.”

There was a tone in her voice I didn’t recognize.

As the days dragged on, it felt like time began to rot around us. My daughter going through a breakdown, and my wife dismissing it at every chance.  
And then, one evening, our daughter came to me. Quietly. Nervously.

She confided in me that something was… wrong.  
Gave details that everything around her was spiraling out of control.  
As if she was slipping into chaos with every breath.

Most worrying of all—she said she could hear things.  
A whisper in her ear when she was ostensibly alone, when she was trying to rest.  
A lone voice.  
Soft.  
Slow.  
Persuasive.  
Telling her to harm herself.

It took me too long to put the pieces together.  
Too late to see the record’s influence.  
It was too long driving home that night.  
Too long walking the hall.  
Too little did I hear the muffled sounds festering behind the door before the silence settled.

However, opening the door felt like an eternity.  
Time buckled beneath my hand on the doorknob.  
The world slowed to a breathless halt.  
I opened the door.

I saw her…  
My daughter.

She was hanging on the wall.  
A noose coiled around her neck…  
Her pale face wept blood…  
Her small feet swaying inches above the floor…

And beside her — motionless.  
Staring.  
Stood my wife.

I moved towards them, my body traversing with instinct, my mind lagging, drowned in horror.  
Grief gnawed at the edges of my sanity.  
I stopped, unable to go farther.

And then… my wife lifted her eyes toward me.

Tears, thick and trembling, crawled down her skin gone white with shock.  
But her lips curled into a smile.  
A terrible smile.  
Triumphant.  
Empty.  
Possessed.

Grief and hysteria danced in her gaze.  
Sorrow twisting her voice, she breathed:

“See? I told you… the song… it’s…”  
*her words spilling like shattered glass*  
“…just superstition… You don’t have to end your own life… Not if someone ends *theirs for you*.”
