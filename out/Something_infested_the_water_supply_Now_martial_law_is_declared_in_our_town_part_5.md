As my family huddled in a random room of the labyrinthine maze of the underground laboratory, I heard dozens of helicopters and jets passing overhead. They seemed to hover near the hidden government site. The voices of hundreds of soldiers could be heard shouting orders. Part of me wanted to go look outside, but I knew that my family and I would likely be caught in the crossfire between the armies of the US government and the hivemind who truly controlled the area.

We ate peanut butter crackers and sipped sodas and juice, trying to regain our energy. I was exhausted. I had hiked countless miles since the crisis had started, seen many deaths and knew, in my heart, that the worst was yet to come. I had blisters all over my feet and my legs were throbbing. My head hurt. I was in fairly good shape and had often hiked five or six miles in a single day, but this was ridiculous. I felt like I must have walked at least fifteen miles since this crisis began. My wife and daughter were in even worse shape. My daughter pulled off her shoes, crying as she showed me blisters that had burst there. She was not used to this kind of exertion.

We had seen no sign of Samael since the forest, though I thought he was likely nearby. He seemed to feed off of the death and pain like a tick feasting on blood. His eyes had gleamed with euphoria and a childish glee as he licked the air in the forest where so many had died, like he could taste the deaths of the townspeople in the air and found it the sweetest treat he could imagine.

My wife held my daughter in her arms, trying to do something with her matted, dirty hair. We talked about better times, and vacations we would take if we survived this. My daughter had always wanted to go to Disneyworld, and I promised that, if we got out of this deathtrap of a town, I would take her. She held her stuffed rabbit, Dr. Hoppy, tight.

That was when the gunfire and screaming started. We were in a room near the hidden exit of the laboratory.

“Do you think X and the doctor will bring the hive down here?” my wife asked. It was an issue I had been thinking about. The answer was, truthfully, yes. Dr. Booth was a genius and a psychopath. He knew as well as I did that if the government troops kept getting killed, they might revert to something drastic, just as they had in World War 2. For all I knew, a nuclear weapon was on its way to this town as we spoke.

“If the government begins to deploy weapons of mass destruction to wipe out the town, then certainly,” I said. “They will take refuge down here and wait for it to pass, then try to escape and spread the hive farther and farther. This is just the first step for them. Dr. Booth wants world domination, with himself as the king of a freakish new human race.” It was just a guess, but it felt right.

He had declared himself the Overman after his resurrection from death, but I didn’t think Nietzsche in his most depraved nightmares would have imagined an Overman like Dr. Booth- with bloody eyes, broken and elongated limbs, black and purple bruises all over his destroyed body, and immensely strong tentacles emerging from his mouth and head and body. I could only hope the US military would destroy him first. He seemed the greatest threat to not only my family, but to the world.

The shrieking of dying monsters reverberated through the tunnels. Suddenly, I heard a sound that sent my heart into my throat- the hatchway of the tunnel being opened by someone who had just entered the code. I heard a beeping and the pneumatic tubes of the automated metal door opening.

“Oh God,” I whispered, putting my finger to my lips. My wife and daughter instantly went silent. I walked as silently as I could over to the front of the room, closing the door and locking it before turning off the lightswitch. I held my pistol up in the pitch dark, ready to start shooting at anything that came through that door.

“Secure the premises,” I heard a man say loudly, his echoing voice muffled through the door. “I want all the research documents of Dr. Booth and Dr. Lao. Bring any survivors to me. If they are affiliated with the research, they are important enough to warrant an evac. Now move! We have limited time until Operation Holy Cyclone begins.”

Heavy boots began to storm through the hallways, flinging open doors and yelling “Clear!” after every one. They drew closer and closer. I knew I was doomed.

A hand fell on the doorknob to our locked storage room. It tried jiggling it, shaking the door. The soldier kicked at it with his legs, sending pounding echoes through the room. It didn’t move, though it shuddered in its frame. A wave of anxiety overtook me. Would this never end?

“We have a locked room,” he said to someone else loudly.

“Then break the fucking door down,” someone else snarled back. I stepped to the side, fearing how they might accomplish that. I whispered to my wife and daughter.

“Get to the side of the room,” I said slowly.

“Yes daddy,” Sarah’s tiny voice answered me. Then a gunshot rang out. The lock exploded and the door flew open with a strong kick from the man on the other side. The sudden light flooding the room blinded me.

Two soldiers entered with automatic weapons drawn. The first one I put down with a shot to the head. His gasmask blew apart, a spray of blood and bone showering the white walls of the laboratory behind him. The second saw my wife holding my daughter in her arms and exclaimed something inaudible under his mask.

Then he opened fire.

With a scream, my wife was shot in the chest. I emptied my magazine, running at him and shooting at his torso and chest. He dropped quickly with a gurgling cry, choking on his own blood as a bullet caught him in the throat.

More soldiers began running down the hall at the sound of the gunfire and cries, and suddenly the white walls began to glow red, like they were being consumed by fire. Samael walked through, grinning, flicking his freakish tongues out. He was surrounded by demonic creatures with blackened skin and glowing crimson eyes.

“Your government has unleashed their shock troopers, their first line to destroy all the innocents here,” he said to the soldiers, his voice echoing and booming through the underground complex. “But Hell has our own shock troopers.” The soldiers began opening up at Samael and the demons with automatic weapons fire, but more and more demons poured out behind him. I looked into the void where the wall had been and saw a horrific sight. Flames licked the ground in a wasteland with dark red clouds and steep cliffs going as far as the eye could see.

The first few demons in the row had their heads and chests blown apart by bullets, but Samael moved in a blur, dodging every one. With superhuman speed, he reached the front line of the soldiers, reaching out his skeletal hands and ripping off their arms with immense strength. He took the severed limbs and began smashing them into the soldiers behind them, knocking them to the ground. Holding a severed arm in each hand like a baseball bat, he began breaking the skulls of the line of soldiers around him. 

They fired their guns blindly into the ceiling as the demons fell upon them, using their clawed hands to rip through their black SWAT suits into their chests, tearing out their still beating hearts and shoving the bloody organs into their open mouths, their countless fangs chewing and spitting out frothy blood. More and more demons poured out of the opening, quickly overwhelming the dozens of soldiers in the hallway. Within half a minute, all of them had gone silent- only the sounds of chewing and sighs of pleasure now coming down to me.

Turning to my wife, I saw with horror that she was losing great amounts of blood. Her chest wound spurted bright red arterial gouts of blood in time with her heartbeat. Her pupils were dilated, her lips turning blue.

“Beth!” I cried.

“Get Sarah out of here,” she whispered to me. “If it is the last thing you do, save our daughter.” I ran over to her, cradling her head in my arms. My daughter was weeping behind her.

“No, mommy!” Sarah cried. “Make it stop! Daddy, save mommy!” Crying, with tears falling into her cyanotic, pale face, I felt her begin to seize, shaking as her eyes rolled back in her head in front of me and our daughter. She died in my arms seconds later.

Samael walked up to me, his grin gone.

“I am truly sorry for your loss,” he said, “but you have to go. Your government is already planning to deploy their hidden chemical weapons stockpiles on this town. If you don’t want you and your daughter to die a horrible death, I recommend you find some gasmasks and protective suits first, then hike to the next town over. It is your only chance.”

“Why are you helping me?” I asked, still weeping. “Why couldn’t you save my wife?” 

“Like I said, only you must survive. The rest of these people are collateral damage. My master had great plans for this nation and this world, but your writing will make it come true.”

“You want me to write a book?” I asked, disbelieving. He smiled cryptically.

“Books can change history, my friend,” he said softly. “Mein Kampf, the Communist Manifesto, the Bible, the Quran- all of these were planned for sowing chaos and destruction and furthering control of governments across the world. But *your* book will be the greatest of them all. You must espouse the greatness of transhumanism. Future leaders will look back on your writings as the turning point when humanity began to evolve to the next stage, creating a new and greater species through genetic engineering and cybernetics. No one else can write the manifesto but you.” I looked up at him, disbelieving. I did believe in transhumanism, in merging the human brain with artificial intelligence and using genetic engineering to create a greater future for humanity, but to get the help of such dark forces just for a manifesto seemed insane.

“You owe us a debt, after all. If you do not do what fate dictates, my master will come for that debt in other ways. Perhaps we will take you, or your daughter. Perhaps your soul will be lost forever. But you’re not a stupid man. You know you owe a debt. So repay us in full.

“This is the last time you will see me,” he said. “Good luck, Jason. Get out alive.” With that, he turned the remaining demons, motioning to them. They all returned through the gateway to the hellish world beyond, Samael following behind. As soon as he stepped through, the door closed.

The silence was deafening. In the aftermath of so much gunfire in a confined, underground space, my ears had been ringing. Now they slowly recovered.

As I stood there with my wife’s dead body still in my hands, my daughter softly weeping behind us, I heard footsteps through the hallway. Running. I put my wife’s body down gingerly, kissing her on the forehead.

“I’m so sorry,” I said, wiping tears from my eyes. “I couldn’t save you. I tried. I really did.” I pulled the pistol from her waistband, turning to see who was approaching. 

“Stay here,” I whispered to Sarah. I was horrified to leave her in a room with her mother’s corpse for even a second, but I had to see what was coming.

I stuck my head out of the door, peaking around the corner- and I saw Dr. Lao running, her eyes wide and frantic. She didn’t see me until I stepped out, raising the gun and pointing it at her heart.

“Why did you do it?” I yelled. “Why did you bring back that monster?” She looked from side to side, as if she expected to see help coming from the endless rooms in the labyrinthine maze of the laboratory. But no help was coming. All of the soldiers were dead, dozens of bodies strewn across the floor, some with their arms or legs ripped off. The demons had eaten the hearts and drunk the blood of many. Huge craters of bone emerged from their chests. A few dead demons were also laying among the bodies of the soldiers, the heads of the demons exploded from M4 Carbine bullets.

She put her hands up slowly.

“Look, I know this looks bad for me, but…” she began, hoping for some Deus Ex Machina that would never come. No rescue was on its way. The hive and the demons had killed all the soldiers in the area, possibly in the entire town. By this point, I thought that only airplanes were likely on their way- airplanes filled with nuclear or chemical weapons. Or maybe they would just decide to carpet-bomb the entire area, just like Berlin at the end of World War 2.

“I never wanted to get involved in this research,” Dr. Lao said, sighing, her hands visibly trembling. “I have stage 4 breast cancer. I’m going to die either way. My only hope was to join Dr. Booth in researching this… serum, this royal jelly. It can reverse cancer or even death in some subjects, as you have seen. I thought that maybe…” I knew where she was going with this.

“You thought your life would be saved by an alien fungus that transforms you into a monster?” I shouted, shaking and angry. She shrugged.

“Not necessarily, but maybe certain genes within the organism could be discovered that could reverse cancer without the dehumanizing process. There are endless possibilities with this organism.” I shook my head, disgusted.

“Show me where the gas masks and protective suits are,” I said, motioning for Sarah to come over. My daughter, pale and trembling, ran over to my side, staying close. “Keep your hands up, and go slow. If you run, I will fucking kill you. My wife just died because of the research you and Dr. Booth did down here, and I am not in a forgiving mood.” Dr. Lao turned around slowly, leading us down a hallway to a room marked “Protective Gear.” She opened the door and I saw gas masks, protective suits and medical equipment of all makes and models.

“Sarah, look away,” I whispered. My daughter turned around.

“I’m sorry, Dr. Lao, but I can’t trust you,” I said, pulling the trigger. The gun exploded, and she fell over in a moment, shot in the heart. She died instantly. I put my arm around Sarah, covering her view with my body so that she wouldn’t have to see the dead woman.

I knew I had no choice except to kill Dr. Lao. She was making more of those monsters, and if she got out, she might restart this somewhere else. And yet, I felt horrible about it- shooting an unarmed woman who was dying of cancer. I had seen so many deaths already, however, that I was mostly desensitized. Now I could only think of my daughter. My wife’s dying wish was to get Sarah out of here. I would kill anyone along the way who I needed to.

I found a gas mask in my size, and a smaller one that looked like it had been made for a petite woman that almost fit Sarah perfectly. We donned protective suits, grabbed our supplies, and got the hell out of there. I would never see that cursed laboratory again. 

We left the same way we had come in, hiking near the clearing where the creatures had been. Dr. Booth stood there with countless monsters, feeding on the blood of the dead soldiers scattered all over the forest. He was the undisputed king of a dead town. Not a creature moved in the forest nearby that wasn’t part of the hive. I didn’t hear any birds chirping or see any squirrels furtively gathering food. The whole place was silent.

Dr. Booth had grown even taller- now standing over twenty feet tall. His muscles had grown, and his tendrils had lengthened. He was truly the king of monsters.

I avoided the area entirely, seeing this only from a distance. I hoped that the weapons the government would deploy would kill him, once and for all. I myself could do nothing. I had grabbed an M4 carbine from one of the bodies of the dead soldiers, but it certainly wasn’t going to work to attack a whole hive.

And this wasn’t my fight. I had a daughter to think about.

A mile or so down the trail, I finally found a soldier still alive, talking into his radio. The voice boomed through the forest, breaking the eerie silence.

“We have lost control of the area, Director,” he said. “Nearly all of our troops are lost. Please send an evac for remaining military personnel.”

“I’m sorry, Agent Matheson,” the Director said through the radio. “We cannot risk our aircraft for a few soldiers, especially with the risk of spreading infection. The Commander-in-Chief has authorized Operation Holy Cyclone. The deployment of cyclosarin will begin in five minutes.” He paused, as if considering his next words carefully. “Thank you for your service to your country. Your sacrifice will not be forgotten.” With that, the radio clicked, and the transmission ended.

The soldier began swearing and cursing at the Director. I walked away, holding my daughter’s hand through our protective suits, taking a wide arc around the soldier.

Another few miles down, and birds and squirrels began to return, though not many. And, most surprisingly of all, I found another man still alive and unmutated. But this one wasn’t a soldier. He was a townsperson. I saw him in a deer stand, high up in the trees. I waved. He pointed a gun at me.

“Wait!” I cried. “We’re just townspeople like you. This is my little girl.” I pointed at Sarah. He lowered the rifle hesitantly.

“Why are you wearing that crap then?” he shouted down. “You look like one of the feds. They have been going around murdering people, you know. I saw them shoot my neighbor. I’ve been hiding up here ever since. Between those damned monsters and the government…” His voice trailed off.

We both heard the first planes overhead. They sounded like cropdusters. At first, I thought it had begun to rain again. Droplets of liquid sprinkled down. But the sun was out, and it was bright and beautiful. This was no rain.

“Do you smell… peaches?” the man asked, looking up at the planes overhead. A few drops hit him, and he immediately fell out of his tree stand, plummeting fifteen feet below.

“Oh God, my heart!” he screamed, clutching at his chest, tearing his clothes apart. I ran over to him. His pupils were tiny pinpoints, his nose leaking mucus and blood. After a few more seconds, he began to vomit, defecate and urinate simultaneously, an expression of horror and pain crossing his face. A seizure wracked his body. He died within thirty seconds.

Sarah and I looked on, horrified. Operation Holy Cyclone had begun. This must be the cyclosarin the soldiers had mentioned- the secret chemical weapons stockpiles the US government was deploying against the town and the hive.

Then I saw a few remaining birds start to fall down from the nearby trees, writhing and seizing. Their wings appeared to fail as they plummeted into the ground, spitting out frothy blood. They died quickly.

The entire area would be exterminated of all animal life. I knew we needed to get out of here immediately. We quickly kept on walking again, eventually finding a line of dead soldiers at the border of the town, many of them with blood drained from their bodies and massive wounds across their heads and chest. After hours more following small deer trails and hidden forest paths, I made it to the next town over. 

My phone started pinging, and I realized outgoing calls and messages could go through again. We had broken through the quarantine zone and left that cursed place behind. And yet, I had left my wife’s body behind, among so many other bodies. Just thinking about her death made me want to break down. Tears began to pool in my eyes under my gas mask.

I blinked my eyes rapidly. This was no time to think about the losses I had suffered. I needed to keep going. We had nearly reached safety now. We had entered a town where Dr. Booth had not infected the water supply and created an apocalypse of death and destruction.

But this town looked deserted too. I looked around, realizing how eerily silent it was.

Then I saw a child run out of a house, the windows shattered and the front door hanging off of its hinges. Red tendrils writhed from his mouth and body as bloody tears streamed down his face.

“Oh God, not again!” I screamed, raising the M4 carbine and opening fire. I wanted to deal with these creatures quickly.

After all, I had a book to write.
