There is something seriously wrong.

I don’t think I am real.

Not in the “I’m-so-lost” kind of way. Not metaphor. I mean, I don’t think I exist in the real world.

I am increasingly convinced that I am trapped in my own body, but I have no control on it. There is someone or something that controlling it. I am just stuck inside, like a typo someone decided to keep.

Everything is too good. Everyone is too nice. Everyone insists I am too perfect. In fact, even everything that I have written seems too correct, as if it is edited or written by ChatGPT.

I always had this nagging feeling of something being off, but this disconnect has become too glaring since the day after the presentation I didn’t give.

Carol from marketing caught me in the corridor, eyes glittering with admiration I didn’t earn.  
“You were electric yesterday,” she said. “Seriously. The room was buzzing.”

I blinked.

“I wasn’t here yesterday.”

She tilted her head like a confused puppy.  
“Yeah, yeah—humble genius routine. Classic you.”

The thought of a puppy tilting its head made me smile.

She thought I’d smiled at her.

She walked off before I could correct her. Which was fine. I wouldn’t have known what to say anyway.

I couldn’t prove I hadn’t been there.

I couldn’t prove where I *had* been.

Later, I found a lunch receipt in my pocket—somewhere called *Pho Real.* Clever. I’d never been there. Apparently, I had the tofu banh mi. I don’t eat tofu. Or banh mi.

And seriously? *“Banh me”?*

I think that was a message.

My stomach hurt. That hollow burn like hunger, except deeper. Not empty. Erased.

I opened the slide deck everyone kept talking about. *Quarterly Forecast, v5 FINAL FINAL SERIOUSLY FINAL*.  
The title slide had my name. My title. The color scheme I never use. I flipped through.

It was… good. Witty, clean, persuasive. Exactly the kind of work I wish I was capable of.

I stared at it too long. My eyes stung. Not from brightness. From *recognition.*  
It sounded like me—but a better me. A *deliberate* me.

That’s when it got weird. Or weirder.

A calendar ping went off. “1-on-1 with Shweta.”  
I didn’t know I had one. I didn’t know what to say. But I showed up. And she was already there.

“I just wanted to thank you,” she said.

“For what?”

She laughed like I was flirting. “You’re too much.”

She meant it warmly. But her face—the *part* of her face that meant it—felt detached. Like a sticker poorly aligned with the rest of her expression.

When she left, I touched the desk. The laminate felt cold to my hands. My hands felt cold to me. like the room had been recently vacated. I sat there for five minutes and tried to feel real.

Nothing.

I went home early. The walk was odd. Each step felt identical—same rhythm, same distance. Then I was pressing the elevator button. Then I was unlocking my door.

Inside: order. Neatness. My handwriting on the grocery list. Almond milk, tuna, body wash.

I stared at it. Almond milk gives me gas. Tuna gives me hives. And I haven't used body wash since I moved out of my parents’ place.

I checked my phone. There were three texts from my sister.

>“Thanks for sorting Mom’s surgery. Lifesaver.”  
“You’ve always been the strong one.”  
“Hope you’re getting rest.”

I called her.

“What surgery?” I asked.

A pause. Too long.

“Wait—are you okay?”

“No. I mean, yes. I just… I don’t remember doing any of that.”

Another pause. Then her voice softened.

“Maybe you’re burned out. You’ve been doing so much for everyone.”

She sounded sad.

Or maybe scared.

I didn’t know for whom.

That night, I opened my old journal. I used to write in it when I needed to remind myself that time was real. That days had shape.

Last entry:

“Nothing feels like anything. Like I’m a blurred photo. I’m here, but I’m not in it.”

Dated twenty-one days ago. The pages after that were blank. Except one. Where, in neat handwriting, someone had written:

“You’re doing great. Keep going.”

I touched the ink. Fresh. Not mine.

I tried to eat dinner. Couldn’t. I wasn’t hungry. I wasn’t full. I wasn’t anything.

Later, I took a long shower. I stood there until the water turned cold and my fingers pruned. I looked at myself in the mirror. Stared into my eyes for signs of misalignment. Checked if my mouth moved the same way as my thoughts.

It did. Too well.

Then I went to sleep on the couch, under a blanket I didn’t remember owning, surrounded by things I’d apparently chosen.

I woke up with a dull ache in my jaw. I must’ve been grinding my teeth again.  
The kind of ache you only get from clenching through dreams you don’t remember.

Also—it was 8:10 AM. I don’t oversleep. I haven’t in years. I’ve trained myself to wake up at 6:45 like some anxious rooster. But this morning? Nothing. No alarm. No memory.

I walked into the kitchen. The fridge had a sticky note on it: **“You matter.”**

The handwriting was round, careful. Not mine.

Taped just below it was a receipt for almond milk.

Time-stamped **7:03 AM.**
