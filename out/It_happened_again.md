I did it again.

I hung up the phone.
It happened again.

Three short beeps echoed through the receiver before I dropped it.
Cold. Mechanical. Familiar.
Like a ritual. Like a warning.
They always sound the same — like the cycle beginning again.

Minutes stretched like days.
I wandered through the apartment without reason.
The wallpaper was peeling in the corners.
The radiator ticked, but never warmed the room.
The air was heavy — like it knew something I didn’t.

My couch slouches in the middle, bent from nights I don’t remember.
The kitchen light flickers even when it’s off.
There’s a stain near the door — it wasn’t there before. I think.

This nightmare keeps repeating.
I thought I could break it this time.
But they always know.
I don’t know who they are. But they exist.
There’s no hiding from them. They’re in every city.
The police look away.
The authorities are part of it.
I tried to resist.
But I can’t fight what’s already inside me.

Nothing helps.
I tried everything.
I played video games until my fingers went numb.
I put on loud movies, something bright, something fast.
I even tried reading old books, ones I didn’t understand, just to keep my brain from slipping.

But the thought always came back.
Heavy.
Thick.
Like fog crawling under the door.

It’s not desire.
It’s not choice.
It just happens.

They don’t force you.
They don’t threaten you.
But they don’t let go.
You do it again.
And again.
And it keeps going.

There’s no stopping.
No way out.

I tried staying with friends once.
It didn’t matter.
He still came.
Different face. Different clothes.
Same knock.
Same voice.

I never asked for help.
Help is an illusion.
They don’t offer comfort.
They don’t speak.
They only act.

Then I heard the engine.

It wasn’t just a sound — it was a growl.
It was laughing.
Mocking.
It knew where I was. It knew I couldn’t stop it.

I saw him through the window.

That same shape.
Thick jacket. Hood pulled tight.
He jumped off the seat and moved like a machine.
There was nothing human in how he walked — just purpose.
I saw the backpack.
I didn’t want to think about what was inside.
But I knew.

There was no one outside.
There never is.
People disappear before he comes.
Like they know.

The neighbors know.
They smile when they see me, but it’s too forced.
Too wide. Too rehearsed.
They say hello a little too loudly.
And then they avoid my eyes.
They know. They just don’t want to be next.

He entered the building.

I counted the steps.
One floor.
Two.
Mine.

I froze.
My feet rooted to the floor.
My hand trembling near the doorknob.
My breath shallow.

A single knock.
Sharp. Precise.
The same every time.

I opened the door.

He didn’t speak.
He simply extended the bag.

**— Double cheeseburger combo, extra fries, large cola.**

I took it.
I closed the door.
Sat on the floor.

I did it again.
