People say the American dream is dead, but it’s still out there for those willing to climb its ever-increasing elevation. I know this because I was living it and if you’re on the outside looking into my life, you may think I’m still enjoying its luxuries. Unfortunately, that dream is hoisted by cheap threads that can—and will—snap with unpredictability that will turn that warm dream into nights where you’re afraid to close your eyes.

If you have children, then you already know that the word ‘love’ is meaningless until they enter your world—a love so pure that you’d happily ingurgitate every sense of pain, sadness, and suffering they could ever endure just so they could live each day with the untainted, youthful smiles graced upon them at birth. They bring such a euphoria into a parent’s life, but when such elations fall from their soaring heights, the pain left from its cataclysmic crash feels like July in Hell.

When they were young, Caiden was a mama’s boy and Courtney, my sweet little baby girl, daddy’s wittle princess—she was such an angel. I was so undeserving. Her chubby-cheeked smile melted my heart of wax and the way she gripped my finger with her adorable little hand made me come unglued. If you would have asked me at any point during my life—up until I saw Courtney for the first time—I would have said that I only wanted to have boys, never ever would I want a girl, not because I had anything against girls, but because I knew the amount of love I would grow for that precious little being would cause me too much pain somewhere down the line. I wanted to be her protector, the man she could always trust no matter what, the superhero that would dish out super-strength, extraterrestrial beatdowns to any person or thing that would bring a tear to her eye.

I am not a superhero. I am no one’s protector. I am garbage.

It was Labor Day weekend and one of those days where you look at everything around you—your beautiful family, the home you’ve created with them—and tilt your head back with the slightest grin thinking you’ve just looked through a peephole and saw a vignette of heaven, that euphoria I was talking about. We were all sitting around the pool, taking dips to cool off, running around the yard with water guns relishing in Caiden and Courtney’s laughter. Maybe I was in heaven because after a day like that, had I have keeled over and woke up at the pearly gates, I would have said, ‘Hmm…I expected a little more.’

I’ve exercised moderately my whole life, but no level of fitness ever prepares you for keeping up with two little nuclear energy reactors.

“Alright you two,” I said. “Daddy is wiped out. I’m going to take a break alright?”

“No! Please? Just a little longer! Squirt me with the water gun again! Please? Come on!” they said in jumbled order. There pleading was almost enough to give me a second wind, and God how I wish it was enough.

My wife, Kristen, was passed out on the pool chair, and I decided to join her. She looked gorgeous in the sun. I sprawled out next to her, taking the weight off my tired legs, and grabbed her hand. She opened her eyes and smiled at me. I looked at the other two loves of my life, my beautiful three-year-olds playing and laughing in the hard. I felt like the richest man in the world. Heaven.

Laying in my chair, I couldn’t stop thinking about how lucky I was. How did a former degenerate like me end up having it so good?

“Daddy?”

I mean, none of this should have happened. I should be in prison or on the streets, but this…this is magical.

“Daddy?”

I can’t wait to watch my children grow up in this house. The next ten years will be a blessing.

“Daddy, look.”

I must have dozed off for a second. Caiden was standing over me with his index finger in his mouth, something he only did when he was nervous.

“What’s up, buddy?”

“Courtney is swimming.”

I can’t close my eyes without seeing my sweet little girl floating facedown in the water. I can’t sleep without hearing Caiden’s voice saying, ‘Daddy?’ waking me up and dragging me back into this hellish nightmare. I can’t think without hearing Kristen’s harrowing shriek when the paramedics said, ‘I’m sorry.’ The moment I saw my baby girl floating in that pool, I felt the heel of God cave my chest in with a vicious blow, knocking me through the conscious world and straight into the deepest depths of hell that are reserved for failures like me. Drowning isn’t like what you see in the movies. There are no cries for help, no violent splashing, none of that; there is only the after math, the constant feeling that a monster is clawing through your eternal chest ever full of fresh meat for the ravaging, the constant urge to either run away from a parasite of torment that’s burrowed deep inside you or tear it out, or just kill the host so the parasite can no longer leech. I’ve contemplated the latter far too many times.

The castle of sand had been consumed by the water.

I was sitting on the couch the day after Courtney’s drowning with my face buried in my hands. Caiden ran around the living room playing with his toys. The most difficult thing I have ever had to do was smile with Caiden and play him during that awful time. He was too young to understand what had happen and still needed the attention of any three-year-old. The second most difficult thing I had to do was call the funeral home to make arrangements. I had yet to tell my friends and family—which could have easily taken the gold—but, I wasn’t ready to hear those words come out of my mouth.

The phone was in my hand and my trembling thumb hovered over the call button to the funeral home closest to our home. I rehearsed my lines in my head, careful to choose the fewest amount of words it would take to take of business before the knot in my throat pulled the tears from my eyes. I counted down from three at least thirteen different times fooling myself into believing that the next count down was going to be the one. This was it. This was the final countdown. Courtney couldn’t stay in the hospital mortuary forever. Action needed to be taken and the responsibility was on me.

1…the knot in my throat is swelling

2…Oh, God. How could I have let this happen.

3…

My phone rang. It was an unknown number.

“Hello?” I answered.

“Yes, Mr. Akers?”

“Yes?”

“I would like to start by saying that my team and I are deeply saddened by the passing of your daughter Courtney. I, too, lost my son at an early age. I know what you are going through, and I express my deepest condolences to you and your family.” The person’s voice was deep and gravely, clearly concealed by some voice altering filter.

“I’m sorry. Who is this?”

“Valid question, and I assure you that we will get to that, but before we do, there are some things that I need to say. There will be parts of this conversation that may make you angry. You will surely want to hang up the phone. You may even ask yourself, ‘what kind of sick person would play such a sick joke,’ but all I can do is give you my full honesty and integrity in saying that none of what I am about to discuss with you is a joke, only good intention. Do you wish you hear what I have to say.”

I stood up and left the room to separate myself from the earshot of Kristen and Caiden to prepare myself for the potential verbal lashing I was going to give this guy. With reluctance, I said “Go ahead.”

“As you may know, the hospital where your daughter currently resides is one of the top research hospitals in the nation. I am grateful to have a partnership with them. When your daughter’s information hit the database, I was immediately notified. As I have previously mentioned, my son was killed by a drunk driver when he was five. My wife and I were t-boned at an intersection. The man was going 66mph and my boy took the most of it. Now, what I am about to say next is where most people scream at me and hang up the phone, but I would like to invite you to our facilities to meet my son.”

“What the hell are you talking about.” He was right. The scream he mentioned was well on its way.

“I know that probably sounds confusing, but I would like to offer you a second chance at being a father of two.”

In my core, there was a battle between curiosity and rage. Silence passed as I waited to see which one would emerge the victor.

“Mr. Akers, are you still there?” said the masked voice.

“Yes—I am.”

“What is your decision, Mr. Akers?”

I didn’t know what to say. It was all too obscure comprehend given my mental state.

“I don’t know,” I said. “I need to talk to my wife. This is just all too…strange. How do I contact you?”

“There is no way to contact me, Mr. Akers. Due to the nature of our research, you must make your decision by the end of this call. Speak with your wife. Take as long as you need. I’ll remain on the line. But Mr. Akers?”

“Yes?”

“I am truly offering you a second chance.”

At the time, I was so vulnerable. I would have done anything for a chance to turn back time to hear my baby girl laugh one more time, to hear her call my name just once more to scare off the monsters under the bed. If I could have had just one more time to be her hero. But what was I going to tell Kristen? “Hey babe, I just got the wildest call. This weird guy on the phone says he might be able to bring Courtney back.” Not a chance. She’d have had me admitted to the psych wing of same hospital Courtney was at.

Ask for forgiveness, not permission.

I picked up the phone. “Hello?”

“Did you discuss the situation with your wife, Mr. Akers?”

“No, but—”

“That’s alright. Most men don’t. Mr. Akers, have you decided?”

I swallowed what little moisture I had left in my throat. “Yes. I’ll listen to what you have to say.”

“Perfect,” said the voice. “We will be in contact with you shortly. Tell Kirsten and Caiden to stay calm. They won’t remember a thing.”

The call ended.

The voice’s sign off made the skin on back shrink around my spine. Stay calm? They won’t remember a thing? The person on the other side of the phone must have though they had a way with words, because his departing statement made me anything but calm. I sat staring at me phone waiting for the voice to call back.

“Oh my God! What is that!” Kristen screamed from the other room.

I sprung from the couch and sprinted towards her as fast as I could for a man wearing socks on hardwood floors. When I turned the corner to find her, I learned something about myself. Every person wonders how they would react in the face of danger, often making fantasies of their heroic acts, but the reaction to what I had saw was nothing like the lies I told myself as to what I would do if my family was in danger. I collapsed. My knees turned into pudding, and I hit the floor—hard. Outside the window, and within arm’s reach, only separated by a single pane of glass was a man, a figure—I don’t even know what to call it. Its face was pure white with no discernable features, but somehow it appeared to be smiling—maybe shouting—I don’t know. Kristen ran out of the room as I laid there in an organic pile of uselessness.

Kristen screamed again, doubling her previous decibel. A loud thump shook the floor. There was silence.

I jumped to my feet and ran out of the room, the thing through the glass still having its featureless face tracking me. The moment I saw Kristen, I froze. Her body was sprawled out on the floor. In front of her were four men—things—holding my baby Caiden in their arms. Each of them wore a matching suit and above the collar was the same face. Before I could yell for my baby boy, one of them raised some sort of instrument.

The pop from the instrument deafened me. I began to lose my balance as my vision blurred. I took a knee. The four abominations walked towards me. I fell to my side. Darkness engulfed the borders of my vision. Everything was nearly black.

I heard my Courtney.
