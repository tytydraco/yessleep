4:22 AM

I’m on the back patio and I haven’t moved in what feels like hours. It won’t let me leave and it wont go away. Every second that I stand here typing and staring at this thing is agony. It keeps its face pressed against the glass so its large features stretch into this horrible expression.

It's inside the house. Only a few feet away behind the sliding glass door. I think it came from the woods. I can see past it, past the hallway and the living room the front door is wide open. Such a fucking idiot. I never lock it back home but here in the middle of the forest I should have known there are worse things than thieves and racoons.

It's tall, thin and crooked. Its skin is leathered and splotched. There’s patchy hair that withers from its scalp in long black strings. Its hands are gripping the glass, shaking. Its shaking now. And it still hasn’t looked away from me. And I can say the same. I can't move. My family's still inside, sleeping but for some reason I can't move. There’s a feeling that if I look away from its bulging eyes for too long, if I lose focus, it’ll get me.

I’m writing this in case this fucking thing doesn’t leave when the sun comes up. I don’t know how I know but I’m certain that when morning comes this thing will leave me and my family alone. But if it doesn’t? If it doesn’t then God have mercy on us.

4:46 AM

Its cold. I’m losing feeling in my toes. The snow I’m standing in has melted into my shoes. I didn’t think I’d be outside for this long. Just a quick cigarette, and enjoy the northern stars. That was when I saw it. I had just made out the big dipper and in the corner of my eye was this gray line near the top of the sliding glass door. I traced it down, and it was that things fucking finger. It was looking at me with its hands in the air like someone surprising a friend at a birthday party. I don’t know how long it had been there already. I jumped to my feet and when I did it smashed its face into the glass hard enough to crack it near the top. I froze, and it did too.

It's huge. My body's telling me that I'm in danger, and the best thing I can do is stay as perfectly still as possible. Just don't move.

I remember glancing at the clock before stepping out for the smoke. It was 2:55. I don’t know how much longer I can last. The crack in the glass keeps growing.

 

5:18 AM

It moved. I couldn’t bear it anymore. My entire left foot went numb ten minutes ago. I tried to lift it and give it a shake to bring the blood back but I lost my balance. I stumbled back a few steps and when I looked back up it was gone. Gone from the sliding door. It too had retreated a few steps back into the house. Back towards the open front door. Towards the stairs leading to my sleeping family. It raised one of its fingers towards the ceiling. It must have been six inches long. The other hand brought another finger to its thin lips. *Shhhh.* I understood. I returned to my original spot, and it pushed itself into the glass once again smearing its face. I can hear the glass cracking.

 

5:51

Can’t be much longer now. Sun rises late here I know that. But surely not later than six. We aren’t that far north. Can’t be much longer. Can’t be much longer.

 

6:42

Its taking ages just to type the time. My fingers don’t move well. Getting hard to keep my eyes open. Where is the dawn? It’s still as dark as it was at midnight. Its still watching me.

 

8:30

My family should be up by now. Back home we always make sure we’re moving bright and early.

The wind sounds like voices. It hurts, biting into the back of my legs. Is it horrible that I'm comforted by the fact that I won't feel it when my whole body goes numb.

I don’t think the sun will ever rise. I think this thing knows that too because it keeps breaking into these violent shaking fits. Laughing. Its laughing at me. I’m laughing too. I can’t stop laughing.

 

?

I just jolted awake. I was asleep on my feet. On my cold black feet. The sliding glass door looks like a kaleidoscope, all the pretty cracks crisscrossing and splintering. Hope its not getting too cold in there. I told them where the extra blankets are but still I want them to get good sleep. We have a big day of hiking ahead of us.

Its smiling at me. It wasn’t before but now I can see layered rows of pearled white shark teeth. As white as the snow. I can see them well because its still as dark as it was as midnight.

But it can’t be much longer now. We aren’t that far north. Surely it can’t be much longer now.
