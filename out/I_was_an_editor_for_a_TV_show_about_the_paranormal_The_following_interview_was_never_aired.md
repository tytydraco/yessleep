*Date: November 1th, 2002*

*Location: Undisclosed studio apartment in Seattle, Washington.*

*Interviewee: Richard Richardson (Pseudonym)*

*Interviewer: Jacob Jacobson (Pseudonym)*

\[Recording starts\]

JJ: And... we are back! I have to say, Richard, you aren't an easy man to find. But the important thing is that we got there in the end.

RR: All that matters is the destination, right?

JJ: Right! Okay, so—full disclosure for the fine folks at home: Richard here only gave us the brief rundown of what he went through while the cameras were off, and let me tell you, it's quite a tale. But we are about to go into the details of it now. So, let's take it from the top. Richard?

RR: Yeah. Well, me and the missus were out for a stroll around \[Redacted\]. Used to go climbing there when we were younger, but my knees aren't up for it anymore, so we stuck to the trail.

JJ: Oh, wait a sec! So, your wife was with you? You never mentioned that. Having someone else there to corroborate your story can go a long way.

RR: She was.

JJ: Got it. Sorry, continue.

RR: Yeah. We were keeping to the trail, as I said. If you've been up there, you know the place is usually swarming with hikers, but it was just us that day. At least I think so. No surprise, I guess—the weather was crap.

JJ: That northern weather, ey? I'm from Arizona, so I can't say I relate. And just so we can get a timeline going, this happened when exactly?

RR: September.

JJ: Of this year?

RR: Sure was.

JJ: Oh, wow, so it's still pretty recent for you. Appreciate you opening up and talking to us about it.

RR: Sure. Can I keep going?

JJ: Please.

RR: We were walking. We were pretty far up there. Just a mile or two more, and we would've reached \[Redacted\]. I was ready to call it a day and turn back, but the wife insisted. She wanted us to make the most of our trip. Can't really blame her. Ever since the kids moved out, we hardly ever left the house. Shit, the kids...

\[Interviewee looks away. There is silence for roughly thirty seconds\]

JJ: Do you need a minute?

RR: No, it's fine. Where was I?

JJ: You and your wife were almost at \[Redacted\]. What's your wife's name, by the way?

RR: Mary (Pseudonym).

JJ: Okay, so, you and Mary were almost at \[Redacted\]. What happened next?

RR: We reached the sign. You know, the one that tells you that you're almost there. Mary took pity on me, bless her heart, and we ended up stopping for a breather. I was picking through my backpack, trying to find my water bottle or whatever, when I suddenly hear "Richard, what the hell is that?". I look over. She was pointing at the sky, like this.

\[Interviewee gestures upwards towards ceiling\]

RR: I look up and, well, there it was, plain as day.

JJ: The spaceship?

RR: It wasn't a spaceship.

JJ: Right, right. Sorry, you said it looked like a flying... pyramid, was it?

RR: An upside-down one, yeah—just floating there below the clouds.

JJ: Interesting. Could you describe it a little more? How big was it? How did it move, for example?

RR: Couldn't judge its size from far away. Could've been as small as a Volkswagen Beetle or as big as a house—maybe even as large as the actual pyramids. Hard to say. As for how it moved, it didn't. Not really. It just floated there, kind of turning on its point a little bit. It's like it had always been there and we never bothered to notice it.

JJ: When you say the "actual pyramids", I'm guessing you mean the ones in Egypt?

RR: Yeah. It was shaped like one of 'em, except it was upside-down and completely black. I mean, black as space, just pitch black, you know? And it had this kind of glossy shine to it, but not like metal. It was more like that stuff they put in pencils.

JJ: Graphite?

RR: That's the one. But it wasn't gray or even really dark gray, it was just black. Like... like there was a pyramid-shaped hole in the sky.

JJ: What I tell you, folks? Extraordinary stuff! This is about where we left off before hitting record. So, Richard, what went down after that?

RR: I mean, for a while nothing really happened; we just stood there. You know, watching it. I guess we were trying to figure out if we were seeing the same thing.

JJ: You weren't scared?

RR: I don't think so. Confused, more like. What's the word, entranced? The thing was pretty in a weird way. Like, you know when you're a kid and you find a really shiny stone on the beach? That's the feeling I got looking at it. I wanted to pluck it from the sky and put it in my pocket.

JJ: What about your wife?

RR: Well, she did what I was thinking. I was behind her, holding onto her shoulders, so our perspectives were about the same. She reached her hand out and then closed it around the thing. When she put it back down, the thing was gone.

\[Interviewee demonstrates by sticking hand out towards camera and closing it\]

JJ: Wait, hold on, I'm sorry—so Mary, your wife, just snatched the object from the sky? How?

RR: Just like I showed you.

JJ: Sorry, uh. Let me rephrase: how on earth did she manage to do that?

RR: I thought you guys were the experts, you tell me.

JJ: Alright, gotcha. So, did she have the pyramid in her hand now?

RR: I don't know. She wouldn't show me. I told her to, begged her to, but she kept her hand closed. She had something in there, I knew she did. I could hear it. It hummed to me, sang to me with the voice of my dreams. And it smelled real nice, like wax and burnt roses...

JJ: Richard?

RR: I wanted to see it, even if it was just for a little bit. Just a tiny bit. That would've been enough. But no. No, I wasn't good enough. Everything I've done for her, and she wouldn't even give me that. Greedy bitch wanted it all for herself.

JJ: Okay, Richard, let's reel it back a bit. What happened next?

RR: What else? I killed her.

\[Interviewer laughs uncomfortably\]

JJ: You're quite the comedian, Richard. Your delivery almost had me convinced.

RR: Well, I sure hope so, 'cause that's exactly what happened. She tried to run uphill, but I got her good with a rock, right in the back of her head. Bam. She rolled back down. There was a lot of blood—more than I thought there'd be.

JJ: Alright, let's—

RR: She was still breathing and, somehow, her fist was still shut tight. I didn't bother looking for a bigger rock. I just stood over her and brought my boot down on her face. Again and again and again. I thought her skull would explode, like in the movies, but it just caved in and this pink-red goop spilled out from the sides. Kind of like—

JJ: Richard! Come on now, let's—

RR: Even after all that, her hand was still fucking closed. Can you believe that shit? Even with her brains bashed in, the nagging cunt still finds a way to piss me off. How fucking on brand.

\[Interviewer gestures to camera crew to contact authorities. Interviewee doesn't seem to notice\]

JJ: Richard, you do realize what you're admitting to here, right?

RR: I am.

JJ: Okay. Cool, cool. Sorry, you threw me for a loop there. So, did you figure out what Mary was holding?

RR: I did. Managed to pry it out of her in the end.

\[Interviewee reaches into pocket. Interviewee pulls out his closed fist with something in it\]

JJ: What's that?

RR: The face on Mars.

JJ: Excuse me?

RR: Neptune; Saturn's rings; Europa; The Great Red Spot; Andromeda; The Milky fucking Way. You name it.

JJ: Not sure I follow.

RR: It lied to me. The song promised that there'd be more. Some higher meaning, you know? It doesn't have to be God, Heaven or Hell or any of that, just... something. I'd take burning in a lake of fire for all eternity over this, 'cause that at least means there’s some purpose to it all. Some design. Some sense of order. Something. Anything.

JJ: Richard, I'm really struggling to follow here. Can you try and be less vague? What is that thing?

RR: The blueprint.

JJ: The blueprint to what?

RR: Everything. Just a bunch of building blocks stacked on top of each other. Every now and then, they fall together in just the right order and create things. Worthwhile things. Boom, planets! Boom, oceans! Boom, Life! But guess what? It's all just blocks. Doesn't matter how many of 'em there are, they're all part of the same set.

JJ: So, kind of like a monkey with a typewriter situation?

RR: There's no monkey. There's no anything.

JJ: Who created the blueprint then?

RR: We did. Not us, but what we will become. It's a cycle. We start off on our own little mudballs, and eventually, we're out there exploring everything, understanding everything. And every time, we reach the same conclusion—it's all meaningless. Randomly generated. We're all alone. And I don't just mean humans; I mean everyone.

JJ: So, you're saying some advanced extraterrestrial civilization sent this message just to tell you that existence is meaningless? Why do you think they'd do that?

RR: Why do musicians write sad songs when they're sad? Why do people leave notes behind before offing themselves? Hell, why are we having this conversation now?

JJ: So, you're saying it’s less a message and more like… an attempt at catharsis, kind of. Alright, Richard, one last question and I think we can wrap it up. I’m curious, does that "blueprint" of yours mention anything about what's outside the universe?

RR: What do you mean?

JJ: Well, if I understand correctly, you're saying the universe is sort of like a set of legos, right? You can arrange them in different ways to make things happen. But as you said, there comes a point where you run out of possible combinations. So what happens after that? Does everything start over or is it just nothingness?

RR: I… huh, I don’t know. I could try asking, I guess.

\[Interviewee raises fist to his ear and shakes it. A low hum is heard. Roughly  twenty seconds pass. Interviewee looks visibly distressed. Interviewee grabs keys off coffee table and proceeds to repeatedly stab self in the neck\]

RR: Burn my brain! Fucking burn it! Burn it to ash! Burn my—
