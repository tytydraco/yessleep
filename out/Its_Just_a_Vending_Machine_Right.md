I’m not expecting this to stay up long, but I need to write it down. I think I'm the only one who knows. Others needs to know. If you're new, you need to be warned. Maybe you’ll call me paranoid. That’s fine. You can scroll past and buy your Doritos in peace. But if something starts to feel off, really off, you’ll think of this. And maybe then, you won’t touch that machine.

It started two weeks ago in the break room at my office, mid-level cybersecurity firm, St. Louis, nothing glamorous. I’d been working late, solo shift. Got hungry around 9. Same routine as always: walk past the dead ficus, stand in front of that vending machine we’ve had for years. It’s the old kind, with the coiled metal rows and a dull gray keypad. Glass front. You can see everything. I swear it didn’t used to hum like that. Not loud. Just... present. Like a TV left on in the next room. 

I tapped my phone to pay. No coin slot anymore, the proprietor had come in a week before and replaced it with a card reader. No more empty slot for you to slide your bills into, just a glowing circle and a touchscreen with those weirdly crisp animations. When I saw it I remembered it was a new guy, not Larry who would come in and restock it every two weeks. I shrugged it off at the time as just the owner wanting to personally check his investment, but now I wonder if he really was with the vending company or not. 

I hit B6 for a protein bar, and the usual whir sounded. I looked down at a notification on my phone when the item dropped. But the sound it made wasn't that papery clap you hear, it was a metallic doing. I looked in the slot and found what dropped wasn’t the bar. It was a lemon soda. It was so strange. I remember staring at the tray like I had misread something, but I hadn’t. I looked up, B6 still had protein bars in it. I stepped back to scan the full row. No sodas anywhere on that shelf, and no empty slots to show I had gotten the last one. The soda had *not* been visible in any of the slots before I made the purchase. And yet there it was. Cold, sweating in the tray like nothing was wrong. Not wanting to waste food I took it, but I was very unnerved.

A few days later, I went back, but didn’t buy anything. Just watched. That same protein bar was back in B6, lined up behind the coil like always. I stood there for maybe two minutes. Then, just as I turned to leave, I glanced back. It had changed. The bar was gone. Same slot. Now stocked with a bag of trail mix. Not my brand, not even one I’d ever seen before. I hadn’t heard any mechanisms move. No clicks. No whirs. No one else had come into the room. But something had shifted while my back was turned. It felt personal. Not like a restock. Like a response. Later that week, I skipped the machine entirely. That afternoon, Derek from Marketing walked past my desk with a bag of dried mango strips, same obscure brand I used to get when I lived in Portland. I didn’t know they had them in Missouri, they weren’t a chain brand. He waved it at me and said, “You’re the reason I started buying these.” I’ve never talked about them. Not once. Not at work. Not online. I didn’t know what to say but luckily Derek kept walking, humming a little tune happily munching the mango pieces. The tune sounded familiar but I couldn’t place it.

Then came the one I can’t explain. One morning I’m back in front of the machine. I don’t touch anything. I’m just looking. Scanning the rows. That’s when I see it. Bottom row, far right corner: Red Vortex Chews. They haven’t made those in over 20 years. Individually wrapped red licorice coils in a silver pouch, kind of gritty, always left your fingers sticky. I used to get them after swim lessons. They were my favorite as a kid. I blinked. Looked again. Gone. Replaced by sunflower seeds. Same slot, like nothing had ever been there. That’s when I started keeping a log. Time, date, slot numbers, changes. Watching it shift. Watching when it shifts. The machine isn’t broken. It’s not even trying to hide. It’s doing something else. And it’s doing it to me\*.\*

I started taking photos of the machine, front facing, same angle, timestamped, every time I walked past. Even if I didn’t buy anything. Morning, lunch, afternoon, late evening. I made a spreadsheet. Product slot vs. item vs. time of day. Nothing dramatic at first. But then I noticed slot C3 changing. Subtly. Not empty, different. One day it was jalapeño chips. Next morning: granola bar. Two days later: baked pretzels. Then, oddly, back to chips. I checked the time stamped photos. The rotation didn’t follow any obvious restock schedule, and no one ever saw the machine being serviced. Not once. The thing just… updated. Quietly. That alone would be odd, but it gets worse. I started skipping lunch on purpose just to see what would happen. On those days, I swear the machine bumped more protein bars and “energy” snacks to the front rows. Options I hadn’t seen in weeks. Like it was anticipating me.

Finally I decided to try something different: I walked past without stopping. Didn’t even look at it directly. A minute later, I got a push notification, unbranded, no app name. Just said: “Forgot something?” I tapped it. It vanished. No trace. Nothing in my notification log. Now look, I know spoofed push alerts are possible. Phishing, remote access, heck, I’ve built them to test our client’s flagging softwares. But this was different. No payload, no redirect, just gone. No forensic trail. I decided to do some digging on the company network. When the card reader got added we were told it was connected to the building WiFi. That’s not uncommon. New models use that for inventory updates and the cashless transactions. But I looked and found ours is broadcasting a second SSID. Hidden. I sniffed packets from it last night. Minimal traffic, small bursts every 4–6 minutes. Some headers include UID strings. The format is eerily close to employee badge numbers. And one of those strings matches mine, digit for digit. So I’m asking: Why does a vending machine need to log user IDs silently over a hidden network? Why did mine seem to know I skipped lunch? And why is slot B6 always different only when I walk by alone? HOW does it change items in the blink of an eye!?

More soon. Going to run a deeper scan tomorrow if I can spoof admin access to the network the machine is using. If anyone else here has access to similar machines, or if you recently got a new vending machine, or the old one recently got a card reader upgrade, I’d like to know if you’ve noticed anything?
