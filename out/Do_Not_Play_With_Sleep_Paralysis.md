I set up all my monitors and organized my medical devices as I loaded up the IV stand. As everything was getting booted up I went over to my camera and adjusted the viewfinder to look straight at my bed, getting behind it to adjust the distance between the camera and the bed. Once I had everything set up I turned my camera on and waited until the light started blinking before getting in bed. I inserted the needle into my arm and hit some keys on my monitors, starting the IV drip as I laid back. I laid as still as possible and took a deep breath and waited for the procedure to stop.

If you haven't been keeping up with the news, the CDC, The New England Journal of Medicine, and other high ranking and highly reputable sources told the world that they've officially figured out to induce sleep paralysis. Yes there have been many horror stories about this phenomenon but it was disclosed that over 2,000 trials had been orchestrated to test not only how to induce sleep paralysis but the benefits of it. These benefits included heightened understanding, more efficient brain function, and has a 100% chance of curing stage four cancer of any type due to upgrading the brain's ability to help the body heal.

Now what about this interests me? Well I'm a medical student specifically studying the brain and it's functions. As sleep paralysis has to do with the brain's role in REM sleep, well of course it swims in my pond. It also interests me as I was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer not too long ago. It was announced that a medication that can induce sleep paralysis wouldn't be released for another 20 years, 10 years I did not have. So I started what I knew I needed to and started my research to begin my own testing and medicating to save my life.

Now don't think this is some way for a 25 year old to cheat death to live longer, I wasn't doing this for me. I was taking full care of my mother who is diagnosed with stage four brain cancer a few years ago who's only gotten worse ever since. My mom is the most important person in my life right now, I couldn't just let her die in a year when I know there's something I could do about it. You know you would do the exact same thing for someone who stopped you from blowing your head off after being told you'd only live six more years.

I dug through everything I could to find my answers, meaning forking out 20 grand on the dark web to have some hack into the CDC. They got me the information I needed including the materials I needed and where to get them that led me to top secret facilities. As a medical student it was easy for me to blend it, one forged staff badge got me everywhere I needed. All it took for me to get what I needed was to just say "These need to be put in storage" before putting them in my truck. Once I had everything, I headed back home where I told my mom I was doing some extra credit work.

I grunted in pain as the liquid shot into my veins where I could feel the concoction of drugs crawl through my body's tunnel and go up my neck into my brain. I screamed out in the soundproof box that was the basement, it felt like napalm was being directly injected into my brain matter to set it ablaze. I tried breaking out of the cuffs that remotely restrained my wrists but I knew I couldn't as I had to just ride out the pain. I braced myself and tried to keep myself as still as possible so that the concoction could work the correct way. I watched the IV bag slowly drain itself and as it did the pain started to subside and turn into a more positive feeling, like a calm wave of water splashed over my body to make me feel like I was floating on air. My breathing slowed down as the bag emptied and I could immediately feel my limbs start feeling heavier and heavier until I could move.

I noticed that I could move my head perfectly fine and could even move my mouth and my fingers a little bit, I chuckled as I said, "This isn't bad." I smiled. My smile was wiped away when I somehow heard my mom scream through the soundproof door, hearing more frantic and vocal cord tearing screams. "Mom!" I shouted as I tried to move. I cried out as I kept trying to move but could only furiously shake my fingers, "Mom, mom!" I wailed as tears began to drip down my face in both fear and pain. Although I couldn't move my limbs it felt like they were under immense weight, enough to even feel my bones breaking.

I then ceased my movement as my door swung open and I turned my head to it as I heard a cracking sound. Out from the door way stepped a foot or a backwards one, then another foot that was straight. I heard footsteps go across the room but the feet never moved from their spot until suddenly a thud hit the roof. I looked up and didn't see anything then looked at the door to see the pair of feet gone, but I then shouted out in surprise as something dropped in my lap. In my lap was my mom's heart and hands that were put in a praying position.

I looked up and saw a headless figure with both of its arms clasped onto the ceiling as a low gurgling sound resonated from it, I couldn't do anything but watch as I saw its arms bend backwards with what I assumed to be blood dripping from it onto me. Suddenly its back busted to have a bucket full of the "blood" drop onto me as a head connected to a tendril slithered from it with no eyes. The head unraveled as it lower down to meet my face, a smile engraved itself on the blank face as more blood dripped onto my face. I looked into its black hole eyes as it spoke in a gurgling and sharp voice, "Did meet your goal Sarah?" 

"G-get away from me." I uttered. The face sprung out a tongue that was pitch black and it extended to lick down my forehead and nose and down to my mouth, I wanted to vomit but even that function of mine was paralyzed. "You wanted this, yes?" The face spoke without moving its mouth. "I wanted to save us. You killed her." I told the monstrosity. It's smile grew larger as more blood sprinkled on me, "I wouldn't have, if you didn't let me in." It giggled in a metal grindingly painful tone. "There wasn't supposed to be side effects." I gulped. "There's a repercussion for every action Sarah." The face told me. I started feeling my limbs again and slowly regained movement, "I'll make you a deal, yes?" The face said. "W-what?"

"You keep inviting me, and I'll keep healing you. You can live as long as you want. You know what I want in return." The thing smiled. "What if I don't?" The thing grabbed my mom's heart and put it in front of my face, "You won't like where you'll go." It hissed. The effects washed away and I was able to get up, putting my mom's remains in the backyard. I cried for a good two hours before putting a call out to the police. Nothing of course came up, not even me as a suspect.

Over the course of two years, 5,000 people came up missing in my city. In those two years I fully recovered from my cancer and was expected to live another 50 years. The only cost was having a conversation with my demon, the demon that I had created to save a life that I ended. Believe me, I don't want to live another 50 years.
