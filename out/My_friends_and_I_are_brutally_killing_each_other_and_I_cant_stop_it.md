Maybe this is all because I called my ex-girlfriend a bitch on her wedding day.

Today is July 6th, two months after my best friend’s wedding.

I'm not one to believe in fate, but as a kid, I was sure I had found my soulmates. 

I remember discovering the word "soulmate" as a curious ten-year-old digging around on my older brother’s laptop. Jace’s girlfriend had broken up with him, and his Google search history was a plethora of "Have I just lost my soulmate?"

"That person entangled with you is upset, and rightfully so. But that does not mean you can't make it right. You are in charge of your own destiny and can win them back. Follow the red ribbon of fate."

Spoiler alert, that weird post was kind of right.

They're happily married with kids now.

Anyway, this isn't about my brother’s soulmate.

This is about my friends.

Like I said, they were my soulmates.

When Dexter Mcintire ran up to me in the fourth grade with a red thread tangled around his thumb, I should have known better.

"Your Mom gave me this!"

I should have cut it off him, rather than teasingly slipping my finger into the knot. Zach Chatham and Falin Clarke joined in, entangling our thumbs. It was supposed to be fun until we realized we had tied the knot a *little* too tight. 

Falin was the crybaby in class, a tiny girl with a golden ponytail and a loud mouth. She made sure to be *extra* vocal to our teacher.

Freckled redhead Zach thought it was funny, giggling through the whole ordeal. I'm not sure what he found so amusing about being painfully bound by a single piece of string that was quickly cutting off our blood circulation.

We had to be gently escorted from the classroom, still uncomfortably pressed together.

Falin was crying, and Zach’s laughter was getting a little throatier.

He kept yanking his finger, which only jolted all four of us.

"Ow!" Falin squeaked. She shoved him. Hard.

Zach was no longer smiling, his freckles a lot more prominent under the fluorescent white light in the nurse’s office. "Are we going to die?" he whispered.

When Nurse Kale pulled out a scary pair of scissors, he almost fainted.

Dexter was unusually quiet. The boy kept sending me worried glances while the nurse hacked her way through our binding. From the look on her face, even she was baffled at how tangled up we were. It didn't make sense how one single piece of thread was so strong.

"How did you even manage to do this?" she hissed, grabbing sharper scissors.

"He did it!" Zach grumbled, trying to point at Dexter. From his uncomfortable position pressed into my shoulder, though, he just manically flailed his free hand.

"I didn't tell you to join in," Dexter snapped back. "You're a stupid head for sticking your finger in the knot."

"I am not!" Zach spat. "You started it!"

"Mr. Mcintire, don't be rude," the nurse sighed. "Apologize to your friend."

"Bird isn't my friend!"

I could tell the nurse was growing impatient.

"Zach, please don't use that nickname. Dexter, say sorry."

"Sorry," Dexter muttered under his breath.

"I can't hear him," Zach said matter-of-factly.

"I said, *sorry!*"

“I still can't hear him.”

Dex shoved him. “Well, maybe you're deaf!”

Zach shoved him back, the two of them stumbling. “You're the deaf one!”

"Thank you," the nurse sighed. She cut us loose with one single snip.

She left to get juice boxes, and for a moment, the four of us were in stunned silence. It was Zach who started laughing first. Then Falin joined in, giggling. His laughter was contagious.

Dexter was smirking, and I was trying really hard to stubbornly stay quiet.

Instead of laughing, I picked up the red thread that had been severed from our fingers, dangling it in Dexter’s face.

The boy snatched it off me, still trying to hide his grin.

"I'll get rid of it.”

But I definitely saw him slip it into his jeans pocket.

I only knew Dexter from his nickname.

The other kids called him *Bird* because his shabby dark hair resembled a bird's nest. I was vaguely aware of his family situation. His mother left him, running off with a college boy, and his father was an alcoholic. Dexter came to school wearing dirty clothes and smelling of stale urine, his hair growing out into a greasy, knotted mess. The other parents would always tut and whisper when he passed them, not so subtly pulling their children close to them like he was diseased. 

Mom told me not to go near him or I’d catch lice.

In the winter, Dexter would arrive with no coat in minus temperatures.

His shoes had gnawing holes through the soles, and I could see his bright red toes poking through. Still, Dexter never lost his smile. He wasn't an outcast among the class, even if parents highly disapproved of us associating with him. Dexter Mcintire lived in his own bubble where he could make jokes and hope kids wouldn't turn on him.

So far, it was working.

After the red thread incident, we got to know him a lot better.

Suddenly, *Bird* was actually Dexter Mcintire, whose biggest fear was becoming his father.

He liked chocolate milkshakes and Zelda, and hated being alone.

I remember first stepping inside his place, exchanging confused glances with Falin and Zach. The hallway was real white marble. When I was greeted to a chandelier, a suited man insisted on taking my coat, I burst out laughing.

The house was *huge*. It had four bathrooms. Dexter’s house was bigger than mine. I marvelled at the architecture, a mix of modern and ancient. There were two kitchens, one upstairs, and one on the ground floor.

Obviously, there was a noticeable mess, even with a maid, who greeted Dexter with a kiss on the forehead. She ruffled his hair, complaining of its length.

Ignoring the beer cans littered everywhere, dirty plates and pizza boxes piled up in the kitchen, I ran up to the refrigerator and yanked it open, pulling out four cans of soda.

Dex was trying to hide small white baggies on the countertop.

"It's… um, it's candy," he said hurriedly, dumping them in the trash.

My friend’s house was not what I was expecting. The boy’s parents were rich.

Like, *rich*, rich.

It was just his Dad who was failing with basic parenting. Dex had a bedroom, and two spare ones he used for video games and watching TV. His bedroom was *full* of clothes and new shoes, which confused me. I picked up a pair of 90-dollar trainers with the tags still attached. Dexter had a whole closet full of clothes, but he had holes in his shoes and wore the same shirt and jeans.

I watched him pick up a brand new shirt, flinging it across the room.

"I'm not allowed to wear anything my Mom bought me."

Zach opened his mouth to speak, and Falin nudged him. Instead of asking questions we really wanted answering, the four of us played Zelda until Dexter’s father came home, called us a bad word, and immediately crashed on the couch. When I told Mom I had been inside Dexter Mcintire’s house, she didn't get mad. In fact, my mother was only vocal about Dexter’s lack of hygiene in front of the other Moms.

When I was eating breakfast, she slipped a note in my hand, stroking my ponytail. “Can you make sure to give this to Dexter Mcintire today, darling?”

I nodded, but I had plans to trash the note. I knew what it was going to say.

*Stay away from my daughter.*

I did peek at it though. I was curious.

*Dexter, darling, would you like to come for dinner on Saturday night? I was wondering if you would like me to give you a haircut.*

*Mrs Leigh.*

Underneath, in smaller writing, she had scrawled the children's crisis number.

Crumpling up the note, my cheeks were burning.

I had seriously misunderstood my mother. I gave it to Dexter, and after skimming through it, he started crying.

Zach comforted him with his DS, Falin squeezing us all into a hug sandwich.

Dex did eventually come for a haircut. Not on that Saturday, though. Instead, Dexter came for burgers and s’mores.

The following weekend, Dexter Mcintire sat in my kitchen with a towel wrapped around him while my mother washed his hair and then cut it into an easily manageable style. 

Zach told Mom about the clothing situation, so she went out and bought him new clothes. I think Dexter had been brainwashed by his father that his mother was the devil incarnate. He wore the new clothes with no problem. 

As long as Dex’s mother had not paid for them, his father didn't say anything. 

I wanted him far away from that house, so I invited him to hang out every day. 

Rain or shine or snow, I made sure Dexter was by my side.

What I didn't expect was to develop a crush on a certain member. 

I hid my feelings, though. 

Dexter and Falin shared a moment at the summer fair. Zach and I didn't even find out until a month later when it was clear the two of them were growing closer. 

I caught them awkwardly holding hands, and they both went tomato red.  

Dex nudged the girl out of the way. “Urgh. We’re not a thing.” He grumbled. “Falin is too stupid. I have standards.”

Ever since getting a haircut, finding his own style and  being labelled as “cute” by the other girls in class, Dexter thought he was the next River Phoenix. 

Falin’s eyes filled with tears but she nodded, sniffling. “Yeah. Dex is disgusting.”

I shot Zach a grin, who in turn stuck his tongue out and threw the candy he'd been eating in my face. 

Turning twelve years old, Falin and Dex no longer tried to hide their little thing. 

When we were hanging out at the park, he'd rest his head on her shoulder, grasping for her hand. Zach rolled his eyes at me, pulling a face, and I suddenly got really sad for no reason. 

They were cute. It wasn't quite dating because we were too young. The two of them were a slowly blossoming thing that wasn't quite a *thing* yet. Neither of them knew how affection worked. 

They broke up over a tuna sandwich before rekindling a day later at school.

But I saw the way he looked at her. His smile was warm and pretty.

And she was glowing. 

Dex was Falin’s soulmate. 

But my gut ached. 

Was I sick?

Did I have a fever? Why were my cheeks so red? I started to hate myself, angry at myself for having feelings. 

I wasn't expecting to get butterflies for Falin Clarke and her stupid blonde ponytail. 

Our friendship was short-lived, however. 

It was small and barely lasted a few years, but somehow, it was special enough for us to want to cling onto it. 

Dad announced we were moving to New York just after my thirteenth birthday.

I was officially a teenage dirtbag, and this was my present. 

Initially, I stayed quiet for a while. 

Mom said we had two weeks before the move and I should say my goodbyes, though the hot topic in class was us becoming high schoolers. It felt wrong to ruin their excitement. 

Zach had grown way taller, and was hanging out with a new group of friends. 

Falin and Dex were officially dating, but Falin and I were also hanging out privately. It was one stupid kiss at a slumber party. Falin said it was a ‘joke’ but she also said she kind of maybe liked it. 

It was a mess. A big fucking middle school love triangle (?) mess. 

Still though, the four of us rode our bikes to the lake during weekends, and it was awkward. Not the same. I felt it in the air, as well as inside my gut. We weren't kids anymore. Now that we were older, we didn't want to play or search for buried treasure. Falin preferred to tan under the sun’s glare, and Dexter brought a book to read. 

Zach was comedic relief, thankfully, making jokes and telling creepypastas. 

I couldn't hide my smouldering cheeks and Dexter was all but a clueless boyfriend with puppy-dog eyes. 

So, I guess moving away was a blessing in disguise. 

I did eventually tell them over ice-cream, my voice wobbling. We hugged and cried, and maybe got a little tipsy on Zach’s father’s pricey wine. 

They were my first real friends, regardless of how tangled we were, and I was already being pulled away from them. 

Falin. 

I was being pulled away from the girl I could not stop thinking about. 

The day before I left for New York, Dex strode directly into my house and kidnapped me from my bed at 6am. It was a school day. When I tried to say that, Dex covered my mouth. Mom handed us a packed picnic basket and ruffled his hair. She only said one thing. 

“Bring her back by curfew.”

We spent the whole day at the lake. One perfect summer getaway. 

Even better, we were missing school. 

When the sun danced across the horizon, the sky growing darker, Dex jumped up from his place sitting on a rock. His smile in the flickering orange from our campfire took my breath away.

Something uneasy writhed in my gut when I stared at my friends through the flames. 

Zach. Who was less smiley than usual. 

Head tipped back, his gaze on the stars twinkling above us. 

Falin. Her hair was caught in a whirlwind whipping across her face, and she looked so sad, despite her laughter and forced smiles. Every time I glanced at her, she averted her gaze. 

“We should make a pact.” Dex said, pulling something from his pocket. The red thread. He held it over the fire, and something twisted in his expression. “To make sure we stay friends forever.” 

I noticed his eyes darken significantly, flicking to Falin. “No matter what.”

Zach burst out laughing, Falin jumping up and wrapping her arms around him. 

“You *kept* it?!” I managed to get out through a breath. 

Dex nodded. He ducked and grabbed a book he'd brought. 

“Okay, so the book says we do this at midnight.” He shot me a grin, wrapping the red thread around his index finger. “Do you think your Mom will kill us?”

I shrugged. “Probably. But it's only two hours.”

We spent those two hours talking about everything and nothing. The boys dipped their toes in bioluminescent plankton and swapped stories from when we were kids. 

I sat on a rock and tried to keep my emotions in check. I loved Falin and Dex, and getting in between them was something I didn't want to do. 

But… I also had really bad butterflies for my best friend. 

Eventually, I pulled her away from the fire where she was making smores, and I said goodbye to her. 

The two of us sat in freezing cold water up to our ankles and Falin said she'd wait for me. My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. I didn't know what the context of *wait* was. 

Would she wait for me as a best friend, or something else? 

I asked her what she meant, and Falin opened her mouth before Dex interrupted. 

The boy waved the book. “It's almost midnight.” He raised a brow at our joint hands. “Are you guys gonna kiss?”

I pretended not to see him trying to hide a smile. 

At the stroke of midnight, the four of us stood under a perfect full moon. 

Dex said we had to repeat exactly what we did at ten years old, entangling our thumbs. 

Dex read a passage from the book, and I can remember every word.

I can remember an uncomfortable tightness in my chest, like we were being physically *bound* together by every word. When the pain became overwhelming, I tried to tug away. But the others stayed still, unmoving and unblinking. The moon cast an eerie glow in their eyes, like she was filling them. 

Polluting them.

*a bond as close as ours*

*can never be broken* 

*and if so* 

*we will pay the price*

*and be brought together*

*again*

*and again.*

Then… it was over.

Dex severed the thread from our fingers and dropped it into the fire.

Zach looked uncomfortable, wrapping his arms around himself. 

“Do you guys feel weird?” He asked in a small voice.

I didn't say anything, but I *did* feel weird. 

Before I could speak up, though, my mother found us. 

She dragged me away before I could say a real goodbye. 

Thirteen years later, Falin *forgot* to invite me to her wedding.

After college, Falin Clarke and I reconnected on Instagram. I actually found her by accident while looking for the perfect flowers for my Mom’s funeral. Several accounts had suggested her now-deleted account, "Flora Flowers."

As soon as we started talking, old feelings came back. I invited her for drinks.

Falin looked no different. She still wore overly long dresses and daisies in her hair, but as an adult, she made it work. Her hair was shorter, blonde curls bouncing on her shoulders. When I saw her, I felt a pull drawing us together, that same sting in my chest from when I was a kid. But it was a *good* sting. I sensed it, that invisible ribbon tangled around the two of us. The closer we got to each other, the warmer and safer I felt.

I got overly emotional about my Mom’s death, and Falin hugged me, opening up about her own life.

She and Dex officially broke up in their junior year when she caught him and Zach hooking up in the darkroom. Falin explained that ever since our pact, things had been different between the three of them.

“Different in a good way?” I asked, sipping my overpriced cocktail.

Falin shrugged. “Kinda!” She blushed slightly. “I don't know how to describe it, but it felt… wrong when we were away from each other. It started with Dex and me, and then he and Zach.” Falin looked sheepish. “When it became clear that something was going on between all of us, we… Well, we tried to make it work.” Her eyes found mine. “But it was painful. It… hurt being so close together.” She sighed. “Without you.”

I nodded slowly, smirking. “Aw. You guys missed me.”

Falin didn't smile back. She leaned across the table, almost knocking her drink over, her lips close to my ear. “I mean *physically* painful,” she whispered, her breath grazing my ear. “It was agony. For all of us. It felt like being ripped apart, like my soul was poisoned.” When she straightened up, her expression was different. Contorted. Like she resented me.

I started to notice her hollowed-out eyes under the club's twinkling lights. L

Downing the dregs of her cocktail, Falin’s smile twisted. “It got bad enough that we started to get physical symptoms.” She counted them on her fingers. “Zach collapsed during class and had to be revived. Dex started throwing up blood clots, and, according to my doctor, I went into cardiac arrest.”

Falin’s lips curved into a small smile. “Would you believe me if I said what we were experiencing was *heartache*?”

I laughed nervously. “This is a joke… right?”

Falin’s eyes were dark. “I couldn't go near them,” she whispered. “Without you, whatever we had was incomplete. Without you, it fucking hurt us. So, we found *other* ways to deal with it.”

I already knew what was coming. Something slimy twisted in my gut. “He didn't.”

Falin didn't meet my eyes. “He did. Right at the start of senior year.”

“Falin.”

“We searched for you, Ruby.” Her voice broke a little. “The summer before our last year, we came to New York to try to find you.” Falin let out a breath. “You have to understand that even being close to you at such a long distance and yet *closer*, it started to hurt less. Zach knew roughly where you were, so we just kept driving. And the closer we got, it was a relief, like whatever had been choking us had let go.”

I opened my mouth to speak, only for her to cut me off. “We found your house.” Falin laughed. “Who needs Google maps when you have an invisible magnet pulling us towards you?”

I suddenly felt very sick. “I never saw you.”

Falin traced her finger around the rim of her glass. “Well, yeah,” she said bitterly. “Your Mom told us to leave. She said you had new friends, and we’d make it awkward. So, we left. We got back in Zach’s car, drove in silence all the way back to town, and the boys and I never spoke to each other again.”

I had a hard time finding my words before she reached for my hand. “And yet here you are.” Falin’s lip twitched. “Should we try finding Zach?”

I found my breath. “Probably not a good idea.”

I'm not fully aware of the details of that night. I just know that Falin and I became an actual *thing*. It did hurt at first. 

Without the boys, I understood what she meant. But we got used to it. It just meant we had to space out our time together. During the day was particularly painful, enough to convince me I was dying. So, we used the night instead.

Then, Falin disappeared. No note, explanation, or even a text.

And then it started to hurt. For the first few days, it felt like the flu. Then I started losing my breath. Countless emergency room appointments told me I was fine. 

But I felt like I was suffocating; every breath was painful. My heart ached in a way I couldn't understand. When I started heaving up blood, I tried to contact Falin. 

No such luck. Flora Flowers was gone, and when I dragged myself there physically, it had been shut down. By then, every day was debilitating, and I felt like I was losing my mind.

Three years. Three years of inhalers, agony, and contemplating suicide.

I caught the announcement on Facebook of all places.

I don't even go on Facebook. I was trying to find an employer from my bar job, and a mutual friend had commented on the post, “Congratulations Falin and Sara!”

Choking up blood was now a daily occurrence. Skimming through the post, I swiped at my wet lips. Sara Kingsland. Twenty-six years old. According to her profile, Sara was a squeaky-clean girly girl who said things like, “okie!”

Her whole profile *was* Falin.

Sara’s latest post made me feel nauseous.

“TODAY! I am marrying my soulmate!”

Underneath, to my confusion and anger, was Zach’s comment. The Zach Falin had supposedly *cut contact with* and *never spoken to again*.

**”Can't wait! I’m definitely going to cry. Love you, Fal ♥️.”**

I saw red.

I'm not proud of what I did next, but you have to understand. I am not the asshole in this.

I turned up at my ex-girlfriend's wedding wearing the best dress I could find. I was breathless, furious, and maybe a little drunk. I missed the ceremony itself. I was turned away without an invite. But just as I was leaving, I felt it—a sharp pull, a tightening in my chest that physically twisted me around. Cheering caught me off guard. Confetti was being thrown in a whirlwind.

I saw Sara first.

Dressed in light pink, she was beautiful.

Surrounded by friends and family who were not me, I watched Falin Clarke emerge through the door wearing a wide smile, draped in a breathtaking white dress that flowed like liquid silk. Her hair was longer, almost to her stomach, braided with flowers. She really did get that Rapunzel-style wedding.

It was hard not to notice how ghostly white she was, like she was being drained. But her smile was real. Not the strained grin she gave me years ago, full of pain.

Falin was *happy*.

I watched her kiss Sara, her new wife scooping her up, making her squeal with laughter. When she threw her bouquet into the small crowd, I bit back that relentless pain straining my chest.

I made peace with my old friend being happy and no longer part of my life. I could ignore that squeezing in my chest and move on with my life without her.

As long as I distanced myself as much as possible.

I started to walk away.

Until I saw who caught the bouquet.

Dexter McIntire. Twenty-five years old. He was still ruggedly handsome, with a matured face and a scruffy, artsy look that screamed pretentious film student. 

The dark shadows under his eyes were prominent, highlighting darker, hollowed-out punctures I barely recognized. Dressed in a white shirt and casual jeans, with a pair of Ray-Bans sitting on disheveled brown curls, he was so *Dex* my eyes were already stinging.

Bird had come a long way from his middle school nickname.

Dex held up the bouquet with a laugh, waving to Falin, who cheered.

At that particular moment, I didn't want to acknowledge his loose shirt collar or the way he was slightly off-balance.

I was too busy scanning for another familiar face.

*There*.

Zach Chatham was further away from Dex. His style was less casual—khaki pants and a suit jacket, a Polaroid camera hanging around his neck. With his mop of dark red hair and freckles, he looked like he had stepped out of a vintage photograph, a touch of nostalgia mixed with charm.

Seeing Zach, regardless of how mad I was, was somehow a comfort. I had missed him. My ex-best friends stood at a reasonable distance apart in the crowd, intentionally ignoring each other's presence. Before I could stop myself, I was already striding towards them.

Falin met me halfway in three heel clacks.

“You bitch,” I said before I could stop myself.

The crowd around us started to murmur in surprise.

“Ruby.” Her voice was a low hiss. “Don't do this now.”

I didn't want to hurt her. But she had hurt me. Even worse, she had left me with no breath for three fucking years.

“You invited the guys?” was all I could choke out, gesturing to the boys. Zach looked awkward, and Dex had the nerve to roll his eyes. I ignored the crowd erupting into murmurs. Falin’s wife stepped forward, but my friend gently shoved her back. “But not *me*? Are you fucking serious right now?”

I was getting more confident, more angry, until I was hysterical, spluttering on a cough. “You left me for three years with no explanation in *this* state.” I gritted through my teeth, “And now you're married to someone I don't even know?”

“Don't start this *now*.” Falin’s cheeks were growing paler, and I wondered if I was the culprit. I was standing too close, an all-too-familiar pang in my chest. Her eyes pleaded with me, but I was past reasoning with her. I felt like I was drowning. Falin didn't speak to me.

But she did tell Dex, who was hovering over us, to “Take care of it.”

That was the nail in the already shattered coffin.

I slapped her, and somehow *I* was the one who felt the sting.

“Take care of me?” I spat. “Like a fucking *dog*?”

“Not the tiiiime, Ruby,” Dex sang in my ear, his breath tickling my cheek.

He *reeked* of alcohol.

With him close, that pull was back, forcing us together.

“Didn't you say Dex was dead?” I spluttered.

Dex’s eyes darkened. He folded his arms. “So, you *did* meet up with her.”

“I told Ruby you were drinking,” Falin snapped. “Which you *are*.”

He pulled a face. “Some friend you are.”

Dex’s hand wrapped around my arm to pull me away, and I shoved him back.

“We are *not* friends.”

His laugh caught me off guard.

“Good!” He was definitely slurring his words. “You put us through hell for fifteen years, and you think we’re *friends*?” Dex snorted, and it came out, all of that pain and anger he'd been suppressing. “Your psycho mother told us to screw off when we needed help, and you couldn't answer one measly letter?”

“I didn't get any letters,” I said through gritted teeth.

For a second, Dex looked confused before he rolled his eyes. “Oh, you didn't get one letter? Not even a text? In the fifteen years we were apart, you never got *one* fucking inkling we were in pain? That we fucking *needed* you?” I felt my body jolt when he stepped closer. 

From the strain in his eyes, Dex had felt that pull too.

He staggered away, offering me a two-fingered salute. “Go home, Ruby.”

Falin started towards Dex, but he shook his head.

“Stay away from me.” His voice broke. “You actually met up with her?”

Her expression crumpled. “Dex, it was for closure!”

“Bullshit.”

“What?!”

“You knew where she was, and how much pain I was in,” he whispered, “and you kept your mouth shut.” Dex stumbled. “I'm done with all of you.”

“Wait,” Zach spoke up. “But what about the—”

“You can shut the fuck up.” Dex turned to him. “You blocked me because you're a coward.”

Zach looked hurt, putting on a mask as always. But he still laughed, still emitted that *Zach* charm. “Oh, *I'm* the coward? I'm not the raging alcoholic who sponges off of his dead mother’s bank account.”

Dex snorted. “I'm sorry, weren't you begging for my ‘dead mother’s bank account’ five years ago to pay some debt collectors?”

“Oh, you couldn't fucking *wait* to throw that in my face.”

“Ditto, jackass.”

“Ditto?” Zach laughed, shoving Dexter. “Are you fucking *twelve*?”

“Oh, *I'm* twelve?” Dex shoved him back. “Don't you still live with your Mom?” 

“At least I have a Mom!”

“Stop!” Falin shrieked. “Just… leave. All of you.”

Her words were final, and so were mine.

I nodded, swallowing. “You're all dead to me.”

The second the words left my mouth, I felt a *shift* in my mind, a sudden, contorting twist in my body. It felt like my chest was being squeezed, my heart suffocating. In one single breath, I was sure I was going to collapse, all of the breath being sucked from my lungs.

I could feel it, the sensation of something unraveling inside me. Coming apart by the seams. Severing.

When my next breath was no longer a pant, a desperate cry for oxygen, I could have cried.

That debilitating ache in my heart I had been fighting for most of my adult life was gone. It was the opposite of what I felt at thirteen years old. That had felt like a weight suffocating me. This was like it was lifting, finally freeing me.

My second breath felt human again.

My third breath was almost a sob.

I didn't have to suck it in and pray it was enough.

I noticed a change in the others, like a switch had been pulled.

Falin’s expression softened, her hand going to her heart.

The strain in her eyes, the pain she was trying to hide, was gone.

Dex’s cheeks had color in them, the dark circles under his eyes fading.

I remember catching Falin’s gaze. She was still mad, and I still hated her.

But my ex-girlfriend’s eyes were filled with tears, a silent *thank you*.

Dex’s lips pricked into a *maybe* smile. But he still wouldn't look at me. 

I loved Falin, but part of me also resented her. I was pretty sure she was my soulmate, red string binding us together or not.

But sometimes it was better to just let go.

We were adults with our own lives. We didn’t fit together anymore, and that was okay.

When Zach’s camera hit the ground suddenly, splintering on impact, I barely noticed.

I was completely at peace with myself, caught in a whirlwind of emotions.

In the corner of my eye, the guy ignored his camera.

Instead of checking if it was broken, Zach picked up a glass of champagne from a server’s tray and shattered it against his own head. Something slimy crept up my throat, because his smile wasn’t wavering. In fact, Zach’s grin only widened when he stabbed Dex straight through his chest. 

It took half a second for my mind to register the blood seeping down his temples and blooming through Dexter’s shirt.

Screams erupted around us, but to my confusion, Dex wasn’t reacting like he was confused or hurt. He laughed, like a kid. Whatever affected Zach had caught him. I saw his eyes flicker, his jaw going slack, his body jolting, like it was no longer under his control. Twisting around, he dropped into a half-crouch and scooped up a broken shard of glass.

I was paralyzed suddenly, time coming to a confusing halt.

It was the light in his glazed-over eyes that terrified me.

*Moonlight.*

“Ruby.”

Falin was grasping my shoulders, but I shoved her away.

“Ruby, we need to go!”

I couldn’t stop staring at him, entranced, as if hypnotized.

I was transfixed by the cavernous emptiness in Dex’s expression, as he stepped forward and, with a growing grin, plunged the shard through Zach’s skull.

I partially snapped out of it when blood splattered light pink confetti, pooling across concrete. 

Zach dropped to the ground, and Dex lifted his head, his vacant eyes flicking to me. The shard of glass slipped from his hand, yet his fingers twitched as he slowly lowered himself, groping for a second shard.

He stalked toward me, slow and deliberate and I found myself moving fast, stumbling in my heels. 

Dex let out an animal-like chitter resembling a war-cry, before a blur of white dove on top of him.

Falin.

My ex-girlfriend squealed in delight, her 
slender fingers tightening around his neck. 

It had taken her, too. I staggered back, aware of the guests screaming, caught up in a stampede. I was aware that I was backing away, my gaze fixed on their struggle. Animals. Dexter Mcintire sprang to his feet like an animal, spitting out something—which I quickly realised was what was left of Zach’s eye. The man was splattered all over him, rich gore painting his shirt, staining his neck. Something sour wound its way up my throat. Dex had been feeding. 

Falin anticipated his every move. The two circled each other, teeth bared.

Dex lunged, like he was dancing, throwing her off balance. 

But Falin was faster. 

She caught him in a headlock, but he squirmed free, and with strength I didn't understand, roundhouse kicked her in the face. Falin, however, was tracking every movement. With a stiletto heel to the chest, he fell back, allowing her to easily straddle him.

And with the grace of my ex-best friend, Falin Clarke extracted her stiletto heel, pinned down his twitching hands, and drove it through Dexter’s heart.

I found myself entranced by the vivid red spraying Falin’s face.

In contrast to her white wedding dress, she looked ethereal.

The thick beads of red dripping down her cheeks almost resembled strings.

So beautiful.

A panicked server pushed past me, drinks shattering on the ground.

“Ruby!”

Someone was screaming—no, shrieking—my name.

But I felt something toxic coursing through me.

And it was only pointing me in one direction.

Sara stood in front of me, shaking me violently.

“Ruby! Ruby, what’s happening?” Her shriek barely penetrated my mind. “What’s wrong with her?”

She meant her wife, prowling like a wild animal.

Instead of answering, I moved towards Falin, who twirled her bloodied heel between her fingers, teasingly.

I dropped to my knees, pricking my finger on a shattered champagne glass.

I grasped it, molding it in my palm.

What was I doing? I wasn’t completely sure anymore; my body no longer felt like my own.

Falin struck first, but I already had one hand wrapped around her throat.

What I wasn’t expecting was for her to stab me in the gut with a nail file. 

That caught me off guard, but I don’t remember feeling anything. Falin took advantage when I let go and finished me off, slicing open my throat. Warm red seeped down my chin, and it was so hard to speak. So hard to tell her I was sorry. 

Except my mind was polluted, drowned with a hatred that tried to force me back up, puppeteering my limbs into weapons.

The bride dropped to her knees next to me, her eyes glowing with an ethereal white light I couldn’t understand, and drew the blade across her own pale throat.

I thought I was dead. 

It made sense for me to be dead. 

However, I woke up the next morning, alive, and somehow not fatally injured. Falin’s wedding could be explained… kind of. According to the town, it was a mass hysteria event caused by a gas leak. 

I thought that too, until the bride herself, Falin Clarke dressed in silk pyjamas, with half of a slice of toast sticking out of her mouth, turned up at my apartment with those exact same vacant eyes, and stuck a carving knife through my heart.

Since my first murder, every day has been a hunt, and it terrifies me. 

My purpose on this earth from the moment I wake up in the morning, is to kill them.

On Monday, Dex drowned me in my pool. Tuesday, Falin shot me in the back of the head. Wednesday, Zach stabbed me straight through the heart. 

Whatever this thing is, it has turned me into a murderer. I can't stop it. 

It's like being in a trance, completely out of my control. 

In this state, I've become accustomed to squeezing the bloodied pulp of their hearts between my fists. I know the exact weight of them. Zach’s heart is weaker. And this terrifies me. 

Dex’s is cold. So cold, I struggle to hold it. 

Falin’s is the smallest, easier to pulverize between my fingers. 

Zach is convinced that if we redo the ritual and “make friends,” this will stop. 

But trying to collaborate with your murderers who can turn on you at any moment is extremely difficult. Dex enjoys it, but to a whole other level.

Ever since he ripped Zach’s heart from his chest, Dex has been infatuated. 

Initially, Dexter was the brains. “We need to bind ourselves together again,” he said when we met at a distance, blindfolded. “Because severing whatever we had was extremely fucking bad.”

He tried to get us to work together. However, the more times we die, the less humanity comes back with us. Dex is the living proof of that hypothesis.

It started with him treating killing as a game, but there’s no winner or loser. No logic behind this. We just kill each other, come back, and kill each other again. 

Whatever this thing is, it’s evolving inside us. At first, we were like animals. 

Now, I don’t know what we are—something between mindless and human, with enough brains to be tactical. 

After acting like a rabid dog for the first month, Dex makes us suffer. 

He is obsessed with the human heart and why ours were chosen—entangled and bound in poison.

We even tried to get the police involved. But they stepped away, as soon as they saw what they were up against. 

In their words: *“This has nothing to do with us. Maybe get an exorcist?”*

Two days ago, I woke up after Dex drowned me in my bath. I was strung up, upside down in his Dad’s old annex. 

I was supposed to meet Falin at a safe distance, but the asshole had knocked me out. I hated how familiar I was with his workshop—clinical white walls and plastic sheeting on the ground to avoid making a mess. I could still see what was left of Zach’s old body—maybe from a week ago—a mutilated torso lying on a silver table.

I screamed, my heart in my throat, knowing he was going to rip it out. 

Dexter had already cut into me, already plunged his gloved hands into the cavern of my chest, giggling like a fucking kid. I was half-conscious, aware of my own blood spilling onto the ground, tangled and knotted around his trembling fingers.

I was staring at string—a single, slimy red string he was pulling out of me. 

It felt like he was unravelling me like a doll. My body contorted as he pulled, and I could feel everything coming apart—body, mind, and soul. 

His eyes were bright, polluted, leaking moonlight that crystallized down his face.

It was like there was a crack inside him, splintering. When the string caught inside me, my vision went black.

I woke up this morning at home, alive, but with a little less humanity. I’m too scared to go outside. Too scared to open my door. 

I can't fucking think straight or type I don't know what to do. 

It’s like a never-ending game of hide and seek. 

We broke that pact, and those little brats are making us pay.

Edit: The mail came this morning. 

No name, no note. 

Just a single piece of red thread burned at the ends.

Is someone *else* playing games with us? 

Edit 2: 

I've been looking through old boxes my Dad sent over after Mom’s funeral. In them are hundreds– thousands– of letters addressed to me. Letters that have been torn up and torched. I can only find pieces, fragments of my friends crying out for help.

Dex was right. 

What the fuck was my Mom doing? 

I'm freaking out right now, I feel physically sick. 

Please someone help me.
