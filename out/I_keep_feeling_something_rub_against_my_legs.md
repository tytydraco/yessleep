Almost every day I feel something rub against my legs. Now, I used to blame it on my cat, trying to get my attention, especially if I were in the kitchen, she's a greedy thing. A week ago I walked into the kitchen and saw her downstairs playing with a toy, and I turned away from her. I started making lunch and I felt something rub up against my leg. Assuming she was there to beg for a bit of my crust again (a one-time treat, she loved it) I looked down but she wasn't there, and I turned back around and she was still downstairs, but rather than playing with her toy, like before she was laying down like she was ready to pounce while staring at my legs, or something around my legs. Maybe one of her other toys was on the stairs and I didn't see it, but it didn't look like she was staring at the stairs. I've told people I work with, and they've said to me that it's gotta be my pants rubbing against my legs in a specific way, but it's happened when I've been wearing shorts too. I might set up security cameras in my house just to try and catch whatever I’ve been feeling against my legs. It feels so much like my cat but I know it's not, and my dogs are too big to do that while still feeling like my cat. I might just be paranoid again. Stuff like this happens to me all the time, and half of it usually ends up being my imagination. However, against my sane side's better judgment, I did order security cameras from amazon when it happened and they got here yesterday. I just got around to it and put them up. Maybe I'll catch whatever’s been brushing against me.

I’ve been waiting for it to brush up against me again and it finally did. I checked the security footage but nothing was there. All it showed was me freaking out again, and my dogs waiting at the gate in front of the kitchen door, getting freaked out too. (We keep a baby gate in the way of the door so they don't eat stuff off the counter, or out of the cat's litter box) Next time I feel something on my legs I'm debating kicking whatever it is. The only reason I won’t is because what if next time it actually is my cat..

These past few days have been insane for me. I finally caught on camera what's been brushing against my leg. I looked back at the footage I caught on the 17th, and slowed it down majorly. I still don't know exactly what it is, but it looks… *human*. It was like a mist, like what you’d see on some weird cheap creepy tik tok compilation, but it was real. I don't know if this proves their videos or not, but I'm definitely not about to become one of them. I was going to show my friends, maybe a family member, but why would they believe me? Almost everyone has tried to get famous off of ghost videos. Maybe I'll catch it again.

It's angry. I can tell. It's never moved objects before. Maybe I wasn't supposed to find out what it was. Maybe it's all in my head again. Maybe… maybe I need to go back on my meds..

I went to the doctor yesterday. I’m back on my meds, they didn’t believe what was happening to me either. It turns out that medicine was not the problem. I am not hallucinating. I know this. It has to be real. I re-watched the slowed down footage and I still see it. Things are still moving. It started to throw things across my house. I don't know what's happening anymore. What did I do?

I went back to the doctor and told them the medicine didn't stop it. They've given me more kinds, higher doses. They still haven't stopped it. Maybe it's real. I don't think it is anymore. It started talking to me, and I heard it in my head. It's talking to me. Telling me to do things. It’s been writing messages on my mirror after my showers. Maybe it's watching me. Observing.

None of the medicine worked. They suggested I be admitted into a mental hospital. I listened to this. Currently, I am writing this from the hospital. I will be mailing it to a close friend, as well as more updates on whether or not I see it still here. I have given them specific information. If this story ends here online, then I will never see it again. - \[REDACTED\] / author

It's still watching me. I know it is \[REDACTED\]. It sees me but I can't see it. It's been talking to me, it says it wants to hurt me. I know it will. Save me \[REDACTED\] You can get me out of here the doctors, they don't believe me anymore. They won't let me leave my room because I'll have ‘Psychotic breaks’ if I do, I won't I promise. Please just let me out \[REDACTED\] I promise I won't hurt them again. - \[REDACTED\] / author.

Hello. I have been the one putting \[REDACTED\]’s letters online, as requested. They also requested that I change any and all names to redacted, however, I don’t understand why. The only two names were mine and her. Yesterday, late at night, \[REDACTED\] passed away to so far, unknown causes. The police think it's murder, but I believe what she said. I think it got to her. Of course, I cannot tell the police, they’d put me in there as they did her. I’ll let you all believe what you want from her notes, whether or not you think it's fake, but I believe her. She didn’t lie very often, and never about something so extreme. If it was fake \[REDACTED\] would have never let it get this far.
