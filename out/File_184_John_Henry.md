**Chapter 1**

**The Joker and the Fool**

Greetings, I am Special Agent Michelle Harris, and I work for a relatively unknown agency called the Department of Paranormal Investigation, or DPI for short. I explained the odd particulars regarding my agency in my investigative report, labeled [File #177: The Story of Emma Summers.](https://www.reddit.com/u/RingoCross99/s/dQZcFbLVoD) Also, a short summary of my background, education, and overall experience can be found there.

This is another one of those reports I felt compelled to complete for various reasons. All too often, cases like this get buried in the archives and are forever lost to the hands of time and indifference. I hope to bring at least a modicum of peace and justice to their memory. Solace and clarity are the only two things that seem to ease the weight that burdens my conscience.

In my earlier file, I delved into the innerworkings of my department when it comes to handling cases. I fear my prior, more informal explanation may have failed to shed sufficient light. I feel it is important to illuminate the reasons why I do these reports outside of their obvious cathartic nature. So please, bear with me. The terminology may be a bit disorienting. But I will do my utmost to keep my explanation terse.

First, I am assigned to the case by my immediate supervisor, who is called a field coordinator. Then my partner and I take some time to look over the files and determine a course of action.

We are assigned to a case for one of three reasons. Number 1: They are part of a project or experiment. Number 2: A resource specialist flagged a civilian occurrence as a PEP. And lastly: the case was directly assigned to us by the abstruse “Board of Trustees.”

As a DPI agent it is my primary duty to identify if the case under investigation is paranormal in nature. If it is then it must be assigned a PLI, which is short for proper level of inquest.

There are two major codes: VPE and EOE. A PLI is accomplished by completing a “final report” and attaching a file number if it is a VPE, or an all-important dossier number if it is an EOE.

These reports are completed by us if they are the latter and a source agent if they are the former. If a case is considered a high enough threat to national security, it is forwarded over to the Board of Trustees for further examination. The trustees will take a vote, and if it passes, the files are handed over directly to the White House. This is when our observational report is possibly turned into a military operation by OSS.

The EOE tag is needed for any report to be taken seriously by the higherups. It is so crucial that getting it wrong could lead to a permanent strike on an agent’s disciplinary record. If a case is indeed considered EOE, it is our job to understand the phenomenon behind the occurrence or disturbance. I do not want to overload my report with DPI jargon, so I’ll end here.

The case in question, CR-File #184. Please, bear with me for another moment. I know I just promised not to cram my examination full of technical bits, but I need to explain why I do these reports specifically.

VPE Cases like #184 are not considered a priority. They are “unofficial reports” in essence, meaning they are paranormal in nature, but not EOEs. Cases of this lesser magnitude are the most common according to the SOP. Usually, we hand over our initial report, called a CIR, or criminal investigative report, to a source agent, and they convert our CIR into a criminal report file, or CRF for short. These “final reports” are given a three-digit file number and stored under the “nonessential” category in our complete archival report folder, or CAR for short.

I must emphasize how rare it is for a special agent to complete their own final report. And for this reason, I am secretly ridiculed by my superiors for being too endearing. It doesn’t bother me. I made a promise to myself that I would never forget the human aspect of every case, no matter how dark. In many ways, it’s the only thing that brings me back whenever I feel astray.

I’ve seen a lot in my short tenure at the department. Most of the things can be easily explained, rationalized, or compartmentalized away. But there are a few cases that have been difficult for me to slip neatly into a folder and lock away inside of my mental file cabinet.

What’s odd is that it’s always the nonessential cases I lose the most sleep over. It’s not like these cases stand out for their brutality or injustice, especially when compared to their EOE counterparts.

You’d think with a bachelor’s in psychology I could unpack my own emotions. Perhaps one day I’ll sit down on my own proverbial couch and spend the evening psychoanalyzing myself instead of all these supernatural beings. Though, I doubt this wonderful idea will ever come to fruition. Considering, I barely have enough time to do anything meaningful outside of work. As you can imagine, a job like this demands the bulk of my attention.

Now to the case in question. CR-File #184. It all began with a man named John Lucas Henry. He had been suspected of killing his entire family in a fit of paranoid psychosis. Initial intel didn’t give us much to go on. He didn’t deny slaughtering his family. His reason was that the voice inside his head made him do it.

Ah. If I had a nickel for every time I heard that line, I’d have a jar full of them by now. Ok. Maybe not a jar, but you get the idea. Forgive my unabashed skepticism, but in my professional opinion, “the voices in my head made me do it” was the typical excuse suspects used when trying to avoid criminal responsibility.

It is true I work for an agency that investigates paranormal occurrences. Believe me the irony is not missed, nor the hint of injustice provided by my incredulity. The fact remains, no one in our department takes this criminal justification seriously. It always falls flat when scrutinized by any agent worth his or her badge.

Though the excuse may be banal and a bit cheeky, the psychology is fascinating. I suppose this would make sense coming from someone who is obsessed with the human mind and what makes us tick. For as long as I can remember, well before I chose to pursue a degree in psychology, and right after the situation with my sister, I often found myself pondering the merits of dualism and immaterialism.

My thesis explored the true meaning of consciousness as well as why so many of us view the brain and soul as separate experiences connected by one source—the body. The last section of my conclusion paragraph went like this: “I am convinced that I possess a soul. And when I die, I will be judged for my sins unlike machine intelligence. Thus, I can say with supreme confidence that no matter how futuristic or evolved artificial intelligence becomes, it will never possess a soul. A machine is cold and objective. The human experience is warm and subjective. Take away our subjectivity and we lose our humanity. Make no mistake about it: AI is Intelligent, and it would be foolish to argue otherwise. Intelligence is a part of their designate, but AI is *not* sapient. This rare distinction belongs to the only surviving member of the human species, Homo sapiens.”

As you can imagine, the conclusion to my thesis was considered controversial in some psychological circles while simultaneously being lauded in certain theological circles. The notoriety is probably what put me on DPI’s radar when I think back, but who knows.

The reason my thesis caused a stir was because of the Astonishing Hypothesis, which was a book written by Dr. Francis Crick. In the book she argued many things. Too many to explain in my report. The crude-gist of her work states that we are in fact nothing but a bunch of neurons, and it is these very same neurons that create what we assume to be consciousness and subjective experience. This is of course a gross paraphrasing of her work, even still, much of what she says in her book has been backed up by cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

I am not writing this report to sway anyone’s ethics or further the debate between dualism and monism. I am merely divulging what motivated me to pursue my studies. In truth, I’ve always had a passion for understanding the innerworkings of the mind. Speaking of which, the case in question, file #184, is an interesting one. What I thought to be a textbook example of severe dissociative identity disorder turned out to be something far more sinister.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our story begins at the Detroit Metro Airport on July 16, 2019. When we arrived, we were immediately hit with our first obstacle. Somehow there had been a mix-up with our seats. Instead of being assigned to business class, we had been assigned to economy.

I found this a bit irritating, but things happen. My partner, the always irritable Agent Adams, wasn’t having it. Seeing his reaction, I tried to calm him, even going so far as to offer him the window seat. He scoffed at my proposition, turned to the clerk, and informed her that we were government agents on duty.

The clerk shrugged, apologized profusely, and told my partner there was nothing she could do. She said it in as polite a tone as possible, which only irritated my partner even more. He hated it when people were being overly nice to him. Me trying to play mediator, I asked if she could book us first class seats for the following flight that just so happened to be in a few hours.

The compromise was enough to get him off her back. He turned his fury on HQ. First, dialing up our supervisor and laying into him pretty thick. This surprised me. For some reason I thought he was calling to inform him that we were going to be late due to a mix-up with our flight. Then after abruptly ending that call, he went after his next target. He dialed up the resource department and cursed their supervisor for assigning us to a case in rural Georgia in the middle of summer.

I remember sighing and telling myself to get mentally prepared for a long trip. Now that I think back on it, I remember how baffled I was by his odd conduct during our first few cases together. I was the agency’s first female graduate from the DPI Field Investigations Unit. As you can imagine, I had studied incredibly hard to earn my badge. I graduated with high marks and did everything by the book. It’s funny now, but at the time, working with Gary had been something of a cultural shock.

I had been assigned to work with him by the Board for reasons that are still unknown. Their decision caused something of a stir and is considered unprecedented. The story behind our first encounter is interesting to say the least. I’ll elaborate one day, but for now, it’s safe to say, I was put into a situation that nearly killed me.

Ah. Those are some fond memories. I admit I’ve learned quite a bit about the supernatural. A lot more than I would have if I was working with anyone else. One of the most important lessons he’s inadvertently taught me was to always judge a book by its cover. Strange, I know—it’s nothing he’s ever come out and said in one of his many, less than witty moments; it’s just something I’ve noticed. That’s all. I say this because out of the five years we’ve worked together, I can count on one hand how many times I’ve seen him fazed under pressure.

Our destination was the city of Butler. I have no clue why places like this were called “city.” It was located in one of the more rural areas of Georgia and was the “county seat” for Taylor County. I already knew it was going to be a long drive. My partner was still cranky from the flight and told me that since I was the junior agent, it was my duty to chauffeur him around. Knowing the operations manual like the back of my hand, I insisted that his claim wasn’t true. When I said this, he shrugged and said he was still groggy from the sleeping pill he took during the flight.

Before I could argue, he hopped into the backseat, slipped on his sleeping mask, and stretched out with the travel pillow he always brought with him. In truth, I didn’t really mind. He had been a total baby thus far. I could use the peace and quiet to think.

Before he drifted off to sleep, I remember commenting how, “If he somehow made it to Heaven, he would get booted for complaining that it was too sunny.”

He found my joke clever and replied with, “Bah! Start driving already. And turn the AC on so I can get out of this hellish heat. Sending me out to the sticks in the dead of summer to chase ghosts! Wait until we get back to HQ, I’m going to file a giant grievance!”

I agreed with his assessment of the case and said as much, “I’m surprised the resource department flagged it. I’m sure this will be a textbook nonparanormal.”

“Remember, Michelle, don’t try to solve the case. We’re not detectives. You’ll burn yourself out trying to be a hero. I don’t know how many times I have to say it. Our job is to give people enough rope to hang themselves. If you do that the case will solve itself.”

I thought about what he said during the drive. It didn’t make sense. But then again, the things he said hardly ever made sense. After dismissing his comment, as the ramblings of a miserable man, I listened to a self-help podcast for about thirty minutes. After that, I sank my teeth into a lengthy audio recording I made the other night, detailing everything we knew about the case.

For the most part, I did a lot of thinking. I thought about my career and if I should put it on hold to pursue my postgraduate. I doubted it. But then again you never know. I know one thing for sure. My job had been taking a toll on me. It's like they were waiting for me to finish my training. I was assigned to work with Agent Adams straight away and have been going nonstop ever since.

Another part of it was the work itself. The things I’ve learned have stretched my moral fibers beyond imagination. It’s shocking to know who really runs the world, how they operate, and that there isn’t much we can do to stop them, other than create an “observation department,” as the vampires love to call us. I grew up in a very religious home. I’ve always known God was real, even before my career. My faith was the only reason I went into psychology instead of psychiatry.

Another thing that bothered me was verifying the existence of God. Oh, and I don’t mean just any old God. I mean God in the biblical Christian context. That’s right. He exists in all of his glory and grandeur just as described. And yet... and yet he hardly intervenes... I, I can’t tell you how much this bothers me... \*sighs\*

The reason he leaves us to our own devices is because of what the angels call his “Almighty Holy Decree on Freewill.” The whole “free will” versus “divine will” controversy or dispute, depending on which scholar or entity you ask, is crucial to the angelic schism, and eventually led to the Great Heavenly Rebellion.

I suppose you could say it was the first doctoral dispute. Amazingly, the issue of free will is still a hot topic within the Holy Order. The rebellion did little to change that. When I first learned this, I was so surprised it took me a few weeks to really digest the implications. I always believed that the biblical story pertaining to God and Satan was a neat little story about good and evil, but it’s a bit trickier than that.

Ahhh, the “Holy Order...” I’ve mentioned the name a few times. Huh. Where would I even begin? I suppose with their mission. Nah. Too complicated... Put it this way: they’re the angelic governing and organizational body for all the angels stationed on Earth. There’s a lot more to it, but this is the short answer.

During the drive I also thought about my family. Based on divine doctrine, I believe my sister’s soul is one of the many unfortunate ones trapped in a place she was never meant to be. The idea of hell had become personal. A little piece of suffering I could call my own. God could be downright cruel sometimes. But rules are rules I suppose. Knowing this made me feel hopeless and sick to my stomach. The pain I had buried when we buried my sister was beginning to resurface. Just then my phone rang.

Speaking of family and inescapable sorrow, it was my father. With that in mind, I took a deep breath before finally deciding to answer:

“Hi, dad.”

“Hello, Ladybug.”

“Pah. I’m not twelve.”

“I know... I know...”

“Everything okay?”

“You’d know if you answered my calls.”

“Sorry. I’ve been busy with work.”

“That’s no excuse for not talking to your father for a whole year.”

“I know. I’m sorry.”

“It’s okay. That’s not why I called.”

“You’re not in trouble, are you?”

“I am. But there’s nothing you can do.”

“Tch. Does this have anything to do with your drinking?”

“That’s what they say. You know doctors, always trying to play God.”

It took me a second to gather my thoughts. The thought of him... it was... it was too grim a thought. “As soon as this case is over, I’ll come visit you.”

“Meh. You act like I’m dying. Your mother is the one you should be worried about.”

“Dad, please. Not this.”

“When was the last time you talked to her?”

“Dad. Come on.”

“How long is she going to walk around in that imaginary world of hers, pretending Ash is still alive? You know I... I didn’t want to leave her. You know that, right?”

“I know. Believe me, I. I know.”

“Hell. You’re the psychologist. You tell me what’s wrong with the bugger.”

“Dad. Please. I’m not a psychologist. And even if I were, now’s not the—”

“Then when is? Why’s it okay for everyone to drag my name through the mud for leaving the crazy hag, but it’s okay for her to drive our family apart! Ash was just as much my daughter as she was your mother’s. You were seventeen! You were there when it happened! You saw how she blamed me! Hell, she still blames me! You wouldn’t know because you got out of there and did right by yourself with college and now this cushy government gig.”

“Dad, I understand. I know how—”

*“No!* No, you don’t know ‘how I feel!’ So don’t bother with it. I’ll tell you alright. Imagine living with someone who won’t let go of that kind of pain! I loved Ash just as much damnit! Look... Look, I’m sorry for leaving your mother, okay? I-I couldn’t keep living like that—being reminded of your sister day and night, thanks to her batty ways. She still makes her bed, you know. Washes the same tired, old school uniforms. Talks as if Ash is due home any morning now. Now you tell me, who wants to live like that? Huh? Gah. No wonder I turned to the bloody bottle.”

He stopped ranting and began sobbing like mad when the pain had finally breached his defenses. It was a guttural cry that was very difficult to listen to. I could feel my own eyes well up, but I had to stay strong. I had to for him and for my own sanity.

“Bloody hell. Sorry, Ladybug. I just wish everything could go back to normal.”

“Me too, dad.”

“You two were close, hey?”

“Yeah. Very.”

“That’s good.”

“Where are you?”

“I’m at the pub.”

“Dad, you really need to stop drinking.”

“Mother Mary...” he muttered under his breath. I could hear the empty shot glass rattle when he slammed it down on the table and demanded another round. He made a scene about it, using our call as an excuse. He drunkenly proclaimed to the whole bar that he had found his long-lost daughter before shamefully downing another shot.

“Dad. You really need to knock it off.”

“Eh. So, what do you think, doc?”

“About what?”

“Am I as screwy as your mother? I reckon you think I have just as many nuts and bolts rattling around as that old tinker,” he said before cackling.

“I have to go.”

“Sorry for my behavior.”

“I understand.”

“Keep making us proud.”

“Goodbye, dad.”

“Goodbye, Ladybug.”

I ended the call and sighed. I remember looking back to make sure Adams was still asleep. I don’t know why that was my first mind, I thought as I fought back the tears. I suppose it’s what I deserve. I had been avoiding my parents for a while now. For the longest I viewed their behavior as a distraction. I made a mental note to visit him and... and maybe even mother... After that, I pretty much blocked out the whole conversation and bravely carried on giving this investigation my full attention.

**Chapter 2**

**Southern Hospitality**

We arrived at the Taylor County Jail at approximately 0800 hours on the following day (July 17, 2019). It was a brand-new jailhouse that was located right across from the old one. Only reason I knew this was because I foolishly went there first, only to be met by a bunch of rusted yard equipment, inside of what was now a makeshift storehouse. Across the way was a set of railroad tracks that stretched endlessly in both directions.

Ah, the good old city of Butler. There wasn’t much to say about it other than it was just like any other small town. Quiet and quaint; the townsfolk were extremely nice but a little too nosey. I wanted to see the courthouse, but my partner frowned upon the idea. And so, we entered the jailhouse and made our way over to the clerk.

I informed him who we were, and that the sheriff was expecting us. He promptly called for him over the two-way. There was a fair bit of radio chatter between them. He apologized for the confusion and asked that we sit tight. Apparently, the atmosphere around town had been tense, but he promised that the sheriff was on his way.

Agent Adams scoffed at the comment before grumbling that he was going outside to vape. Before leaving, he made a snide remark about how annoying it was having to wait. He sneered when I informed him that perhaps this was karma, giving him a taste of his own medicine.

I remained inside and exchanged a fair bit of small talk with the young clerk. I learned a bit more about him and the case. From what I gathered, he loved his softball league, hated the fact that he came third in the annual chili cookoff, and thought all the fuss over Mr. Henry’s case was unwarranted. I agreed with his last sentiment and told him that the sheriff probably pulled a few strings to get the case handed over to the FBI.

I didn’t tell him this of course, but we receive a significant amount of our cases from the FBI and CIA. Especially the latter, so much so, we call them “legacy cases” because they’re partly to blame for my agency’s existence in the first place.

Being that this was a rural area, Mr. Henry’s behavior and alleged crimes had stirred up a hornet’s nest. These were good, honest townsfolk, who believed that God and hard work were the cure for everything. Nobody could wrap their head around the fact that it was one of their own and not some sleazy ne’er-do-well from the big city who had committed the ultimate act of evil.

My opinion of the case was that this was a classic example of “the devil made me do it.” Technically speaking the devil cannot make anyone do anything. There are a few technicalities, but suffice to say, we rarely investigate “the devil made me do it” crimes because of this. At the department we call these archetypal cases “crying wolf.”

The sheriff arrived before we could sink too deep into conversation. When I looked over, I saw him shaking Agent Adams’ hand. He made a colorful comment about the weather as they made their way inside. His offhanded remark got a slight chuckle out of my partner.

He walked over and introduced himself as Sheriff Russell Giles Junior. When I asked what I should call him, he said, “Everybody calls me Russ.”

We chatted in the lobby for a while longer. This was due to us having to wait for his deputies to secure John Henry before he could be moved into the interrogation room. The sheriff offered to take us to see the Ward Edwards Museum later that day. In his words, it was the world’s largest outdoor museum. A claim which cannot be refuted since we failed to take him up on his offer. He also gave us a few pointers regarding places to eat. Apparently, the China Wok restaurant was all the rave, and Ms Betty’s Fried Chicken was one of a kind, especially the fries. He also told us more about the courthouse.

“Everyone visits the courthouse,” the clerk threw in, which got a nod and chuckle out of the sheriff.

I told him we tried the local coffee shop, but it wasn’t open.

The clerk laughed and said, “It’s never open.”

“Why is that?” I inquired.

“Their boy’s sick,” he answered.

“That’s nonsense, Ernie. Now stop putting bad rumors on honest folk. Ain’t nothing wrong with their boy.”

“Sorry, boss,” he meekly replied.
