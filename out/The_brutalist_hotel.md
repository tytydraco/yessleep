I don’t believe the brutalist hotel still functions. I think it once did. I get that feeling from the yellowed plaster, and the brown stains on the ceiling tiles tell me a lot of smoking once took place here. The coffee-colored linoleum in the dormitory wing is pockmarked with ancient cigarette burns as well.

The brutalist hotel lies near the north end of the dream version of the city where I live. I first found myself there via the lurches in time and geography that always thwart my travels in my dreams. As usual, I was headed for a bar. There are several bars in the dream version of the city where I live that are dear to me. Rarely do my dreams allow me to get there, and, even when they do, I’m rarely permitted more than a glance through the door. Otherwise, I guess I wouldn’t know they exist at all.

In this instance, I was headed to a bar just north of the train station in the dream version of the city where I live. I had lucked out in finding my way out of the train station and I was frantically making my way there. My pace is always frantic in my dreams. This particular bar is not my favorite, but it has a second-stringer charm that one sometimes desires.

The train station is a terrible place. It contains an impossibly long row of menacing brass turnstiles that are automated by some inscrutable machinery. They click and turn of their own accord. Above each turnstile is a mechanical display, with rustling numerals that constantly change according to no logical pattern I can discern. The tumbling numbers sound like shuffling cards and angry hornets.

I hate the train station. The people there are blurry phantoms, and very unhelpful. They take pleasure in being unhelpful. They want you to be confused. Unlike the bars, my dreams always permit me to spend lots of time in the train station.

The people in the bars have definition. Their faces are clear and tangible, with deep lines and creases. The bars are working-class, and the patrons are mostly male. They rarely smile but they are kind. They are drunks. They sip shots with their beers and smoke endlessly. They are not phantoms. If I needed help, they would help me, if my dreams ever allowed me to talk to them. They cuss good-naturedly at each other and tell the kinds of jokes that are banal but make one feel secure.

When I say the brutalist hotel no longer functions, I do not mean it is uninhabited. I have come across at least four tangible inhabitants, as well as plenty of phantoms that whisper and gibber and generally do nobody any harm, though I am not sure that they do not intend harm. What unnerves me the most about the brutalist hotel is the fact that it looks like it once contained multitudes. There used to be company there, and now there isn’t.

The lobby of the brutalist hotel is nearly the size of a modest hockey stadium. A tiny cubicle right by the door contains the first tangible inhabitant I have met: the watchman. He is bald, somewhere between sixty and seventy years of age. He wears hornrimmed glasses with thick lenses. He is surly and smells like cabbage, because he cooks sauerkraut and potatoes in a small, cheap aluminum pot on a hotplate which sits on a tiny shelf behind him. Above the hotplate is a Stihl calendar from 1987, featuring jaundiced nude women with perms and garter belts. I like the guy, but he doesn’t seem to like anyone. Sometimes he challenges me with gibberish questions. Sometimes he just glances up at me with mild disgust. He watches old sitcoms, dubbed into Czech or German, on a portable TV. I can’t see the tiny black and white screen, but I always get the feeling it’s something like Step by Step or Perfect Strangers. The laugh track does not make him smile.

I saw him smile once, though. One awful night I found a screeching, dying chicken in a dim corner of the stadium-sized lobby, on the dirty tile floor near a tatty old sofa and a stale, aluminum standing ashtray. It lay on its side. I tried in vain to pick it up, but it continued screeching as it turned ash-gray and my fingers penetrated its body. Its body crumbled sickeningly under my touch.

I looked across the vast expanse of the lobby and cried to the watchman for help. He sighed and came out of his cubicle. I saw he was wearing shorts and rubber sandals over bare feet. As he came over in imperious strides, I stood up, the ashy matter of the chicken coating my fingers, and pointed to the mess on the floor. I tried to make myself understood, but I didn’t speak his language. He looked at the chicken and laughed in an almost lascivious way. He grinned and elbowed me in the ribs, making remarks in some dialect that seemed halfway between Slovak and Polish. It was obvious by the nudging and the leering that the remarks were unseemly.

The stairwells are the worst part of the brutalist hotel. Sometimes the stairs take you to the next floor up. Sometimes they take you back to the lobby, in which case the brutalist hotel is nothing more than an infinite stack of lobbies. That is so hateful. Sometimes they take you someplace else. Once, they took me to a large, dark cabin in a logging camp in winter, where my dead uncle threatened me with a revolver because he thought I was a Nazi. That was a long night. Many times they have taken me to the train station.

The stairwells themselves are almost totally dark. They contain most of the brutalist hotel’s phantoms. I also once met an old woman in a headscarf on one of the landings. The landings are as large as most people’s bedrooms. She was standing behind a folding table in the near darkness, selling a pitiful assortment of fruits and vegetables. She was nice to me. She chatted amiably about the quality of her produce, but it was all sad, mushy, and wrinkled. I fished a few cents from my pocket and bought a pear. Later, as I progressed up a flight of stairs, I accidentally dropped it. It rolled down the stairs and became lost in the darkness. I worried about that. I didn’t want her to find it and think that I had considered her pear not good enough. Not that I had had any intention of eating it: I just didn’t want her feelings to be hurt. My dreams often consist of my trying hard not to hurt or disappoint other people.

On one of the middle floors of the brutalist hotel is an open conference room. It has two sets of double doors that are always propped open. It’s actually not very large. It’s always dark in there. I don’t know if the lights work or not. I’ve never tried to turn them on. The floor is orange linoleum. The walls are white stucco, with a swath of beige around the bottom four feet. It is furnished with square particle board tables and straight back chairs. 

The windows in the conference room are so hateful. I know, intellectually, that if I look out of them I will see nothing but a dark street, and a sidewalk lit by dim, yellow streetlights. Yet I dread those windows. They will show me the faces I see in the bathroom tiles, the faces the trees make through the thin fabric of my bedroom curtains during the morning of the hangover, the faces that dwell behind my eyelids during the night of the hangover.

On an upper floor of the brutalist hotel, behind an unmarked door, is a log cabin. I know. I’ve seen it. I was lucky enough to get there once. My dreams let their guard down. Now, they try to convince me I was mistaken, but I know that’s a lie. I’ve been there. I’m not foolish enough to think I’ll ever get back there, but my dreams will never convince me it was an illusion.

My Aunt Fay was in that cabin. She was just getting ready to go on a trip to Natural Bridge when I came bounding in. She said my name in surprise and laughed, as was her way in life. There was a creek rock fireplace with a roaring fire and an old gas range nearby. She heated up a can of Chef Boyardee Roller Coasters with meatballs in a battered old tin pan for me. Then my hateful dreams propelled me back to waking life. It didn’t take my dreams long to realize their error--but, still, they slipped up.

I think it’s on the same floor--maybe one above, maybe one below--where the dormitory wing is. It lies behind heavy steel double doors with frosted glass. It reeks of stale cigarette smoke, but no one is there anymore. The doors of the rooms are heavily padded and covered in maroon vinyl, studded with rivets, as if they were government offices. But they’re not: they’re dorms. I know because I once forced my way into one.

My dreams had played with my feelings one too many times. Every few months or so I get strength in my dreams. Despite the slow, underwater movements that confront almost everyone in these fearful situations, now and then we can power through, through our sheer frustration. I forced a padded door open and was confronted by a small entrance hall. To my left was a bathroom and a separate WC. In front of me and to my right were doors leading to the two bedrooms.

Moonlight shone through the frosted glass in the door in front of me, so that’s where I went. I opened the door and the cold moonlight spilled onto the coffee-colored linoleum. One twin bed was stripped and empty. The other contained a desiccated corpse wrapped in a heavy duvet.

The corpse raised its head and roared at me. I fled the room in terror.

I recount these episodes because they are a break from monotony. In reality, this is what the brutalist hotel means: monotony. Usually I see no more than the lobby, or the awful stairwell. I would actually like to explore the brutalist hotel more, but my hateful dreams rarely permit it. Still, I have deduced, through the mysterious omniscience that often accompanies one in dreams, that somewhere in this hotel there is a restaurant, and even a bar. I believe they are usually empty, but I have a slim hope that sometimes they are not.

I believe that everyone from my life--past, present, and future--is in the brutalist hotel, but it is so vast, I do not believe I shall ever find even one of them, apart from my Aunt Fay. The dreams really let themselves down with that one. Our dreams exist to make us miserable, of that I am convinced, and they will not let that brief, stolen beauty slide. That is why I fear death. I know, when the time comes, my dreams will carry me into the conference room, and force me to look out the dreaded windows, and wait to see whatever deferred horror I shall see.

I will wait for the faces, the whispers, the shadow at the foot of my bed, the dead classmate weeping in the armchair, and it will remain, forever, in the hallway, just out of sight.
