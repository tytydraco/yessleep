I..i have no idea of what happened, the continents..they just..changed in the matter of hours, and you don't have to be no geologist to know that this isn't natural

I was at my friend's house, Jacob, we were going to binge watch this series he found on netflix, i think i got there at 9 P.M, so we had plenty of time to watch, we prepared ourselves some snacks and beer, nothing unusual of friends, and so he turned on netflix on his television and we started to watch

The serie was good, not perfect i guess, the thing is, at some point he asked me to get him some beer on the fridge, of course i did, giving him a confirming nod before i stood up, stretching and groaning after being sat for so long, i went to the fridge, opened the door and grabbed two bottles, one for him and another for me

When i got back to the living room, and weirdly enough he had collapsed, apparently from exhaustion, of course i was weirded out, he isn't someone that sleeps early. 'maybe he had a rough day or was holding the sleep to watch with me' i first thought, but then I began to feel sleepy, it felt like someone shoved a sleep gas grenade inside my lungs, i barely managed to place the bottles on top of the table before i fell to the ground, not far away from Jacob

I think i slept for atleast twelve hours straight, and i only woke up because i was shaken, literally, Jacob was shaking me like if i had died or fainted, not only did it seemed, he was panicked, his voice was in a tone i've never heard him speak before, fear..desperation and panic, of course i..barely had any time to actually understand what he was saying, sounded like he was speaking an alien language before i truly woke up

He was on the verge of tears, and as soon as i could i began to try to calm him down, but he couldn't stop speaking what i thought was non-sense, he kept saying

"The continents..! The continents shifted!! It's chaos!! It's a cataclysm!!!"

And after that he pointed to the TV, before i tried to say anything he just yelled, begging for me to watch the news that were being broadcasted, so i decided to just watch it, maybe he would stop if i watched.

As i sat myself properly on his couch i stared at the television, for some reason it looked dimly lit, as if there was less than half of the energy coming to his house, but i didn't really cared, what i would see on that screen was something that i can't even describe properly..

A male reporter informed how everyone in the entire world passed out at the same time, on the USA timezone that was at exactly 12 P.M, but in other parts of the world it was still daytime..of course, the amount of accidents and deaths that occured because of that were simply too much to count, people on airplanes..cars..people doing heavy jobs, most of them were dead, and nobody knew why everyone passed out!

But that was just the tip of the iceberg, a few minutes after the male reporter finished explaining the screen showed a live satellite broadcast of the globe, it was exactly in real time

God...Jacob was right, the continents..the world..was in a unrecognizable states, continents that were thousands of kilometers away were now connected

The continental USA had collided with  France and the Iberan peninsula, causing a new mountain chain, Denmark and the Scandinavia connected to Greenland, forming a horrific amalgamation of ice, mountains and forest

South America and Africa united into one as well, but not in the way one might expected..the whole South American continent turned upside down, merging with the African litoral, making the Atacama mountain range bigger, while unfreezing the patagonian region and freezing the amazon forest

Central America was the least affected continent,  but it didn't meant it didn't suffered any effects, all of the rivers on the region widened, getting so wide that they separated entire countries and regions by kilometers

Asia and Oceania seemed to change completely, turning into their opposites, Asia turned into a series of islands and archipelagos, while Oceania's hidden landmass emerged, turning into what i think by sight is now the biggest piece of land

That..caused the most amount of deaths, mostly on the beach and litoranean cities, but also because of the flooding and the emerging land, i was terrified at that vision, Earth looked like an alien planet, there was no Atlantic Ocean anymore, just land on where it once was..

I stood up, going to the nearby window to get some fresh air, and...i saw it..we don't live far from the beach, but not close either, maybe that's why we didn't died, but holy fuck what i saw...

It was a mountain, a lot of mountains on where the beach was supposed to be, and on the other side of those mountains it was Europe, or what's left of it now..scientists are trying to discover what caused all of this, but i don't think we are going to get a good answer in a good time, me and Jacob are gathering some supplies, even tho the planet seemed to calm down the people are far from calm.

I've hears of a new sea tho, one that people have called the 'Tridiatic Sea'. As it seems to be the Adriatic, Red, and Mediterranean seas all combined, some people are saying that the Su√©z opening is one of, if not THE reason of this new body of water coming to existence, maybe they're right, i don't really know.

UPDATE 1:
There are a lot of speculations over the Tridiatic Sea now, it's been around 5 years since the new continental shift happened, and from what i've heard a lot of swimmers and fisherman dissapeared after getting inside the water, me and Jacob are decided tho, we are travelling to the old Egyptian territory and visit this sea, just for fun, they even opened a sort of museum/aquarium to show the new fauna and flora that started to blossom there! The specialists say that they evolve astonishling fast, so we already got some new fish and plants growing around!

UPDATE 2:
Jacob and i already got here, Mount Sinai stopped being dead and deserted to being a country sized oasis! We are staying in a hotel that recently got built, just going to explore a little bit, Sinai somehow got independence from Egypt..while the same got split in half, so that's fun.

Me and Jacob are going for a swim on the sea tho! See if all of those legends and cryptids are true-

UPDATE 3:
Swimming on that Hell hole disguised as a sea was a fucking mistake!! Jacob, he just..sank! He sank like he weighted the same as an elephant! I heard his screams of terror before getting completely submerged, the bubbles of his breath slowly stopping coming up from his lungs! It's true! It's fucking true!!
