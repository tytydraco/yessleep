I’ve studied biology for years. I was always interested in the way animals behave and why they do the things they do. I hoped I could use my knowledge in biology to pursue a future of paleontology. I couldn’t find a job that could pay well and let me use my knowledge on prehistory. This is my final year in college, and I still haven’t found a proper path to take. I felt like every human was born with a specific trait. Some were born smart, some were born strong, some… a mix of both.

I don’t think of myself as a smart person. I possess rational thinking skills and a good understanding of animal behaviors. I was born with an obsession with prehistoric life. I was fascinated by genetic behaviors hardwired into animals based on ancient memories of trial and error. If I remember correctly, those are innate behaviors. Adrenaline could revert man into a feral beast fueled by the hope of survival. Those ideas couldn’t help me work a 9-5 job at a retail chain. I could never use my knowledge to better myself. I began to loathe my curse. Wonder only brought you so far. However, my fascination would later become a convenience.

I can’t begin to describe how strange this situation came to be. I hope whoever reads this has a good laugh, though. Biologists and paleontologists are probably laughing at my testimony. At this point, believing me or not doesn’t matter, as that isn’t what I should be talking about. I don’t remember all their names or if they had family. I regret it.

It was on a Friday afternoon. While my classmates were eager to get home after enduring a grueling week of exams, I headed to the science lab to meet up with the professor. Our professor, Mr. Princeps, had organized an event for me and a select few to go on a field trip to Costa Rica. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say I was shaking with anticipation. I had no girlfriend to spend my summer with, no job to attend, and my parents were busy with work. They decided to give me some money to pay for the trip.

Professor Princeps studied the classroom of eager students. Unlike most school trips, we would not gain any sort of extra credit or reward. We simply went on this trip for the love of biology. A student I didn’t recognize tapped the tip of his pencil against the laminated plastic desk, smudging the grey chalky substance as he moved his arm. Princeps adjusted his rectangular glasses and opened a tin can of breath mints.

“I’m glad you could all make it here today.” Princeps said, smiling. “This is the largest number of students to join me on our annual trip so far! I am honored to be your guide on our trip to Costa Rica.” He beamed through his bushy grey mustache. “I’ve heard from my partner that they’re doing some kind of new experiment with birds, but I don’t know much about that yet. Anyway…” he slowed, noticing he was starting to rant. The class stared at him with anticipation.

I raised my hand.

“Yes, Luke?” the doctor said, his attention turned to me.

I cleared my throat, eager to learn more. “What kind of experiment with birds?”

“Well, I don’t know much, but…” Professor Princeps explained, “but I do know that they’re bringing large bird species in from other continents, I think to see how they adapt to the humid climate.”

I scratched my head. I was going to ask another question, but I decided to let it rest. I didn’t want my classmates to get mad at me.

“That settles it, then.” The professor said. “I hope to see you all at the airport tomorrow.”

 

I parked my old, beaten car far away from the entrance to avoid traffic. I noticed a few of my other classmates getting out of their cars. Some all got out of one car. They must’ve convinced their friends to join the trip. In retrospect, I’m glad I never brought any of my friends. As excited as I was for this trip, being in a new environment with a bunch of strangers didn’t sit right with me.

I dragged my luggage through the automatic doors and adjusted the backpack resting on my shoulder. I saw Professor Princeps surrounded by at least 7 other students. I went to join the group.

The next day wasn’t very interesting or memorable. I went through customs, dealt with TSA, and headed to the gate. Our group all sat relatively close to each other. I sat next to a student with dark, curly hair and glasses. Beads of sweat dripped down his neck.

“Scared of flying?” I asked him. He scratched his skinny arms and looked at his lap.

“A little.” He said, lying.

“Y’know, you’re more likely to die driving to the airport than actually crash.” I said reassuringly.

“Gee, thanks.” He said sarcastically. “Everyone’s heard that one.”

“So… you’re just scared of flying?” I said, trying to fix our conversation.

“Yeah, I don’t really care about statistics, I just don’t like it.” The guy said, twirling his jet-black curls.

“That’s fair. Anyways, what’s your name? I don’t think I have any classes with you.” I said in a friendly tone.

“My name is Matthew. I don’t attend most of my biology classes because I already know everything.” he said.

“Whatever helps you sleep at night.” I said, hoping he wouldn’t notice.

I decided I needed to at least understand the guy. Matthew, I mean.

“So, Matthew, what video games do you play?” I asked him.

“Video games? I usually play retro Sega games on the genesis console.”

I was trying my best not to judge him. This man was overly pretentious, but at the same time, I respected his choices.

“I’m just gonna sleep through this one.” I said quickly.

I did exactly that. When I woke up, my whole body was stiff. I stretched my legs and popped my knees as far as I could in the small space available to me. We exited the plane. The humid climate felt like walking into a bathroom after someone took a shower. I tugged on my shirt collar.

We were all loaded onto buses and transported to the camp. I walked along the side of my bus, inhaling the hot fumes and hearing the loud rattling of the engine. I noticed a dead animal along the dirt road. It must’ve been some type of bird. I decided to avoid it so I wouldn’t get sick. I sat in the back of the bus while everyone else talked with their friends. We eventually pulled up to the campsite and exited the bus.

“Alright class, put away your things.” Princeps said, pointing to the large tentlike building. “When you’re settled, follow the signs and make your way to the discovery center. We are about to miss something special.”

I hurried and put my suitcase under my bed. I was lucky to have the bottom bunk. It wasn’t a privilege; I was just stubborn and preferred being close to the floor in case I roll out of the bed.

As we entered the lab, a bearded, olive skinned man in a lab coat greeted us. Dr. Princeps introduced him as his friend, Dr. Harding. Dr. Harding stood before a table with eggs incubating in an advanced device.

“What we are witnessing, gentlemen… is the hatching of a baby king vulture. The nest was abandoned, so I took it in. It’s a miracle that the egg survived this long without a mother.” Dr. Harding said, his voice oozing with excitement.

“Shush, it’s hatching!” Princeps said, hushing the class. The tall bleach-white egg shook and cracked, crumbling to pieces to reveal the hatchling. The featherless chick, coated in the egg’s fluids, slowly moved out of the shattered shell. Dr. Harding collected the shattered eggshell and threw it away. He gently picked up the hatchling and showed it to the class.

The class talked in hushed whispers.

“Where is its beak?”

“Is that a claw?”

“That’s too big to be a vulture, right?”

I looked down at the chick, pushing past the crowd. My blood ran cold. On its leg, above where the talons would be, was a fully pronounced dromaeosaurid sickle claw.

“That…” I said, baffled, “is not a vulture.”

Dr. Harding turned to Professor Princeps and gave him a look I couldn’t understand. Princeps pulled his cellphone out of his pocket and sent a text to an unknown number.



 

Since we got to the camp late, we didn’t have much time to explore our new home. I sat in bed staring up at the top bunk. The other students in my dorm room were fast asleep. Some were snoring. I couldn’t get the thought out of my head. I had to see it.

At around 12:00 in the morning, I crept out into the main area. The camp consisted of many buildings surrounded by an outdoor garden. I walked through the dark garden, listening to the croaking sounds of frogs and the calls of birds. I noticed an exhibit with a bird symbol over the door. I was confident they moved the hatchling into that exhibit. My hands reached the handle when I was confronted.

“And what are you doing up this late?” A cunning male voice said from behind me. I turned to see a tall Asian man with messy black hair. His lips were twisted into a smug grin.

I held my hands over my head and closed my eyes. “I guess you caught me, camp counselor… or whatever your job is. What’s my punishment?” I proclaimed unenthusiastically.

“Don’t worry, you don’t have to apologize, I know exactly what you want to do.” He said, looming over me. My heart pounded. “What might that be?” I said, trying my best to conceal my fear.

“We get your types every year. I understand completely. Everyone has the right to learn. You’re just eager to see the animals up close, right? I was exactly like you when I was younger.” He said in a warm tone. His voice seemed passive-aggressive, but I couldn’t really tell because of its higher tone. I looked him up and down nervously.

“You’re not doubting me, are you?” he asked, pulling me from my internal debate.

“N-no, I wouldn’t do that.” I stuttered.

“Good to hear. I’ll give you 20 minutes. If I don’t see you back in your dorm by then… I’ll send you home.” He said, his eyes piercing into my soul.

 

I nodded understandingly. I watched as he walked back to the employee dorms as I entered the unlocked lab. There were many enclosures holding animals from toucans to ostriches. Why were ostriches here?

I made my way to a concrete lab bench with a tall bird cage on top. Inside was the hatchling. I crouched to get a better look at it. There was a plastic syringe full of mushed nutrients next to the cage, but it does not look like it has been used. I walked outside and snatched a beetle off a leaf. I went back inside, opened the cage, and gave the hatchling the beetle. The hatchling stood up and wobbled towards the insect.

I was stunned. A bird alive for less than 12 hours was already walking. I wasn’t sure if birds were even able to do that. Even so, I knew that animal was not a bird. The hatchling scooped up the beetle and crunched it in its teeth. Its head bobbed as it crept into a corner and ate, eyes never breaking contact with mine. Its eyes were not birdlike. They were bright orange with a yellow tint. It reminded me more of a lizard than anything. A wing fell from the hatchling’s mouth. The hatchling ruffled its quill-like protofeathers, wiping the guts off of its face.

I must admit that at the time, the hatchling was adorable. I’m not sure if it was that big when it hatched, though. No, I’m absolutely certain of it. That animal has grown at least a few inches. In order to do that, it would have to eat huge amounts of food, but it doesn’t look like it’s eaten anything besides the beetle.

It couldn’t be a bird. Its skin was too thick and scaly. The body was too long and slender for a hatchling vulture. It barely even had a beak. It was more akin to some sort of reptile. The best way to describe it was prehistoric.

115 million years ago, Deinonychus went extinct. Somehow, maybe by pure chance or by the actions of man, Deinonychus has been born once more.

If I told you the morning went better, I would be lying. We all woke up from our shallow slumber. I felt like I slept on a pile of rocks. The dorm room’s walls had faded, peeling paint. The ceiling light had a barely noticeable buzz. All the small inconveniences all piled on to make my morning hard to get used to.

I rushed through breakfast at the cafeteria. I felt a chill run down my spine as I ate a hashed brown. Turning around, I set my gaze on the counselor I encountered last night. His bright silver eyes felt like cameras waiting to catch a criminal. I couldn’t tell if he was smiling or sneering at me. I finished my food and washed it down with a swig of orange juice.

I excitedly rushed to the bird house as soon as I could. The cage wasn’t just empty. It was destroyed. The cage door had been ripped off. The glass door was shattered. The birds seemed alert and stressed. An African Grey parrot ruffled its feathers and bobbed its head. “Class.” The bird said in a monotone voice. “Project. Class. October.” It recited random words, bobbing its head excitedly.

Before I even realized it, the whole camping crew was in the room with me, trying to figure out what happened. My classmates were distraught at the loss of their new pet. They eventually settled on the bird escaping. However, I knew that wasn’t the case. The cage had been ripped open from the outside.

I decided to tell them my theory and see what could’ve happened. Back when we were ignorant, we believed a monkey had somehow broken in and ate the hatchling. Howler monkeys were known to trample the garden and steal the various fruits grown by the staff. They kept their distance from humans but that didn’t stop them from causing problems. A monkey breaking into a building on the campsite was unheard of unless a window was left open near the canopy. Due to the lack of residue from the hatchling, it was likely carried away instead of eaten on the spot.

Everyone started to exit the bird room. I walked closer to the African Grey parrot and watched it as it climbed around its massive cage with its feet and beak. It grabbed a twig, lodged it under the cage door, and pushed it open. It climbed out of the cage and flew on top of a tank. It looked at me, tilted its head, and made a strange calling sound. It used its feet to scratch its neck.

“Hi, bird.” I said in an adoring tone.

“Hi, bird.” It repeated in the same tone of voice. The parrot grabbed a nut and hobbled over to a bowl and dropped it in. The parrot danced and clanged its beak against the bowl, its intelligent eyes watching me with anticipation. “Treat.” it said. I opened a few drawers and found a bag of sunflower seeds. I opened the bag, and the parrot immediately landed on my arm and scarfed down the seeds. I quickly shut the bag and put it back in the drawer. A primitive mechanical device beeped, opening a door behind the ostrich enclosure, allowing them to go outside and roam in their pen.

As I was walking back to the cafeteria to receive a briefing on daily activities, I was confronted by the counselor, who then introduced himself as Ezekiel. “I don’t think you broke the door or stole the hatchling. I am going to make that very clear.” Zeke told me. “However, that does not clear your name in this event. Nobody else knows you went in the bird room last night.”

I nodded as he continued, “I do want to know one thing. Did you see anything when you left the bird room?”

I pretended to think, but I already knew I had nothing to tell him. “No, I don’t recall anything suspicious.”

Zeke looked me in the eye. “Well, Luke… I believe you. I’m willing to put my faith in your testimony.” I had nothing to worry about because I was telling the whole truth.

The first day went by quickly. We went ziplining and hiking through nature trails. A guy named Isaac demonstrated his expert tree climbing skills. Professor Princeps had to stop him from grabbing a bird nest 20 feet off the ground. When we arrived back at the campsite, we were all given tie-dye shirts in traditional camp fashion. The bright colors gave me a headache.

I stepped over a branch when Dr. Harding held his hand out, stopping me from moving forward. “Ants.” he said. I looked down at a colony of small black ants clustered around a tree. “These are bullet ants. Don’t touch them.” he told the group.

“They all live with the same directive: feed the colony. These ants use swarm tactics to overwhelm their prey, then they use their immense strength to pull the corpse back to the colony.” Harding lectured. “And of course, if they manage to bite you… it won’t stop hurting until the next day, if you’re lucky.”

I reached down to scratch the weird tickling feeling on my leg. Right before my nail made contact with my skin, I noticed the unmistakable shape of an ant. Without thinking, I swiped it off my leg. I almost sighed with relief when I noticed the ant crawling on my hand. I squealed like a toddler and brushed my hands together. I couldn’t find the ant after that.

On the second day, we went on a hike to a creek. Once we made our way to the c, reek, we all boarded a canoe in groups up to 3. I got a boat with the most unathletic people I’ve ever met. I did most of the heavy lifting, paddling us through the dim jungle. The creek was covered by the jungle roof.

“Try not to get your hands in the water. We sometimes find caiman around this area.” Dr. Harding said. Unfortunately, it was difficult to enjoy the scenery, as I was straining my muscles to pull two skinny guys who held the paddle sideways. Suddenly, the oar was pulled into the water. I tried my best to win the tug-of-war, but I lost my grip. The oar swung overboard, smacking into my temple as it plunged into the water. “The hell?” the kid behind me said. “Why’d you drop it?”

I sneered. “I didn’t drop it, something pulled it in!” I hissed at him, already agitated from straining myself. He gave me a confused look. “What do you mean?”

“I mean,” I repeat myself, “something pulled my oar into the water, and I can’t get it back.”

I suddenly had a realization. “What’s the depth?”

“Sorry?” the kid asked.

“What’s the depth of the river right now?” I repeated.

“Oh, the depth is…” he said, examining the device implanted into the side of the canoe. “It says 4 meters.”

“Are you sure? I think my oar could’ve been stuck on the riverbed.” I told him.

“No, wait, it… it says 2 meters now.” He said with a look of concern.

“That’s not possible, we’re in the middle of the creek, it doesn’t get shallow here.” I said.

“One meter now.”

My eyes widened in realization. A large object collided with the bottom of the canoe. I could hear the hard plastic scrape against a rough  surface. We huddled towards the middle of the canoe as it rocked wildly.

A massive shape traveled below the surface of the river, barely disturbing the water. It moved sluggishly as it traveled along the light current.

“Is that a crocodile?” the guy behind me asked.

“No, its… its too big.” I said, confused.

“Could it be a saltwater crocodile, then?” he asked.

“Those things live in Australia; I doubt they would migrate here.” I said, unsure.

The tail propelled the creature, causing a small ripple in the water. The animal shook its head. A moment later the oar resurfaced, snapped in half. I quickly grabbed the oar and examined the damage.

The guy in front of me widened his eyes. “What did that?”

I held out my hand. “Give me your oar, we aren’t going to sit here all day.”

 

 On the third day, we were allowed to go free roam and find fruit to bring back to study. We were warned of dangerous species of ants and other insects. I opted to walk by a stream, hoping plants could grow next to the water source. I noticed a large mango tree hanging over the stream, but something was off. The mangoes were the size of watermelons. I watched as one snapped from the weak branch and hit the ground with a wet thud. The roots of the mango tree had visible purple veins that were brighter when closer to the water.

“Guys, over here!” I shouted. I looked around the empty forest.

“Is anyone here? You have to see this!” I shouted again. “Over here!”

I desperately wanted someone to see these strange fruits. I decided to grab one and carry it back. It felt like it was going to pop at any second, as the mango was not meant to be that size. The stem was oozing a purple substance. Then I heard something from behind me that I’ll never forget.

“Over here.”

The voice was deep and scratchy, as if someone were to talk after being sick for weeks. It sounded guttural, like it wasn't coming from vocal cords. Like a parrot.

“O-er here.” It said again.

I slowly turned around and dropped my melon-sized mango.

Thud.

“Here.”

I was standing face to face with a prehistoric predator. I froze. I didn’t even breathe.

Fiery orange eyes. Sleek feathers. It was about as tall as my my rested elbow. Its body was coated in grey and white feathers, excluding the head, which sported black feathers. The muzzle lacked any sort of plumage but made up for it with bright red scaly skin. Over its eyes sported protruding eyebrow feathers that occasionally flared up.

The Deinonychus bobbed its head. I held my breath and stood still. It tilted its head to the side curiously. It inched closer, its sharp toe claws digging into the loose soil. The sunlight filtered through the trees, causing the light to refract off the feathers like a kaleidoscope. “Over here.” It barked again.

“Over here.” I repeated in an exhausted exhalation. Its eyebrow feathers raised as its head perked up with newfound curiosity. It inched closer. I raised my hands over my head like a bear. The Deinonychus backed away, intimidated. The therapod balanced on a bipedal stance elegantly, walking backwards without stumbling. The tail readjusted as it walked. the dinosaur waved its tail feathers in a slow, hypnotic motion and hissed softly. In the blink of an eye, the Deinonychus dashed away into the thicket, carrying a mango melon with it. I wanted nothing more than to announce my victory, but I decided to grab a mango and take it back to the camp.

The trip back was nothing short of a journey. The mango, which weighed at least 8 pounds, was hard to hold on to, especially given its strange proportions. I had to travel uphill, my tendons straining as I scaled the elevated path. When I reached the campus, I shifted the mango into one hand and opened the door.

“You’re late, Lucas.” Professor Princeps said. The other students looked at me in confusion. “What is that in your hand?” Princeps asked.

“Oh, this?” I asked, remembering the fact I was carrying something. “It’s a mango.”

The crowd exchanged confused glances. “That isn’t a cantaloupe?” someone whispered.

 “Hand it to me, Luke.” Princeps said warmly.

The professor grabbed the melon-sized mango. He sat it down on a table and cut into it with forceps. Thick, purple liquid bled from the fruit. “I must say, Mr. Luke, this is an interesting specimen.” The professor said.

I nodded my head in agreement. “Are you sure this is a mango?” he said. “It looks more like a decaying cantaloupe… but what is this purple ooze?” he said, examining the liquid stuck between his fingers. He pulled a piece off the mango and took a bite out of it. The class was shocked, concerned about the risk of the fruit being toxic.

“This thing tastes… absolutely delicious!” Princeps said in awe. “Its sweeter than candy, the texture feels like biting into a giant block of honey!”

Princeps turned to me. “Lucas… where can I find more of these?” he asked, anxiously waiting for my answer.

“That’s the hard part.” I said morosely. “I want you all to take me very seriously. There is a bird. A large flightless bird. It was there when I found the tree. It could be very dangerous.”

I decided that although it could be helpful to tell them what kind of animal it was, I wouldn’t. If they didn’t believe me when I told them it was a dinosaur, they would assume the rest of my story is also false. I didn’t want anyone to go looking for the tree and getting hurt.

Professor Princeps thanked me for giving them helpful information. “Alright class.” He announced. “Let’s move on to the next station: insect identification.”

The class began to pack up and leave. As I started to walk out the door, he called for me. “Everyone can leave except for Luke.”
