A naked man covered in blood ran down the street, crying, screaming, zigzagging wildly and looking over his shoulder as he ran.

“Please oh God help me!” he said as he ran, then an inhumanly long arm appeared out of nowhere, grabbing him by the throat and pulling him into an alleyway. The arm was emaciated and sickly-looking.

“Oh my God,” my wife said to my right, peering out the window, “did you *see* that? That arm must have been ten feet long!” I quickly shut the curtains.

“Get Sarah,” I said, referring to our only child, “and go to the basement. Grab as many canned foods and bottles of water as you can.” I ran upstairs to get my shotgun, grabbing a couple boxes of slugs and buckshot and throwing them in a canvas bag.

Police and ambulance sirens flew by outside, but I paid them no mind. They wouldn’t be able to help much, if at all. We had tried calling a few minutes earlier, but the line had been busy. It was the first time I had ever heard of 911 giving a busy signal.

As we all settled in the basement, a couple boxes of food and water next to us on the table, I found an old radio I kept down here in storage. It was covered in dust, but I blew on it, sending a gray cloud of it into the air. My wife started coughing. I sheepishly apologized, plugging the radio in and turning it on.

“...civil broadcast from the United States government,” a robotic female voice stated. “As of 9 AM Eastern Standard Time, martial law is being declared for your local area. All emergency services are suspended until further notice. Please stay in your homes and await further instructions. Help is on the way. This is not a test.” Then a loud beeping sound issued from the radio, and the message started to repeat. I tried changing the station, but it was coming through on every one.

Someone started slamming on the door upstairs, and I heard the kitchen window directly above us being smashed.

“Be quiet,” I whispered to my wife and daughter. They trembled, pale statues in the darkness of the basement. I heard heavy footsteps above us, and the sound of someone dragging something.

From further down the street, I heard screaming and wood being smashed, as if someone were kicking in a door. It sounded like a car had driven into the house next door. I heard the shattering glass and rending metal of the car hitting a structure, then a piercing woman’s shriek. The smell of smoke began to permeate the night air.

I also heard what sounded like children screaming in our front yard, and a woman who was probably their mother trying to yell instructions at them.

“Run!” she said. “Get away from…” Then her voice was cut off with a deep gurgling, choking sound. The voices of her children went soon after. I had a small window in the basement, and I could see thick, gray clouds of smoke outside. It obscured my view of what was going on further down the street.

“Should we go help them?” my wife said. She grabbed my hand reflexively. Her hand felt cold and I could feel her pulse through her skin. I shook my head.

“Beth, we have our own child to worry about,” I said. “The radio says martial law is declared, which means we just have to wait for the military to arrive.” I listened for movement upstairs, but nothing else was happening that I could hear. I turned back on the radio. The robotic voice had stopped its monotonous repetition and now a deep man’s voice was speaking. He sounded calm and unhurried. I caught the tail end of what he was saying.

“The situation is under control,” he said. “I repeat, the US military has the situation under control. What we ask from you, citizens of our great country, is this: do not drink the water. Do not shower in the water. Do not cook with the water. Don’t even wash your hands with the water. Only drink previously bottled water or other drinks. We believe this outbreak is the result of a localized infection of the town’s water supply. An evacuation is in progress. Please stay in your homes. For your safety, phone calls, text messages and internet access will be restricted. We will report back when more information is available.” The voice ended abruptly, and the robotic voice started speaking again.

“This is a civil broadcast from the United States government. As of 9:15 AM Eastern Standard Time, martial law…” I turned the radio back off. I looked at my wife. She was terrified.

“Have any of you drank any of the tap water lately?” I asked Sarah and Beth. They all shook their heads in unison. Luckily, all three of us drank a lot of milk and juice. I always cursed how expensive it was, having to buy an entire gallon of whole milk and a carton of orange juice every other day, but now I was thanking God for their taste.

From the second floor of our house, we heard crashing and smashing, then a deep voice shouting. It sounded like someone was dragging a body down the stairs. A woman started crying, then her voice was cut off.

“What’s going on up there, daddy?” my youngest daughter asked, looking up at me with her big blue eyes. She looked so small and helpless in the dim light of the basement. She was holding a brown stuffed rabbit I had given her when she was a baby, which she had named Dr. Hoppy. I don’t know where he got his medical degree from, but he seemed to be doing a good job of keeping her calm, so I appreciated his bedside manner.

“Sarah,” I said, getting down to my knee so I was on her level and putting my hand on her shoulder, “I think there are sick people all around us. But help is on the way.” She held her little rabbit up to me.

“Is Dr. Hoppy going to get sick too?” she asked in a whisper.

“No, Dr. Hoppy is a doctor. He knows more than we do about staying healthy,” I said, smiling at her. Then something started smashing against the basement door, causing all of us to jump.

I chambered a round into my Benelli, the 12-gauge giving a satisfying ringing noise. I looked up the rickety stairs, waiting. At this distance, I could easily shoot through the basement door with a slug, but I wanted to make sure it wasn’t a police officer or military personnel or even just a neighbor looking for help. I wished I had cameras in the house.

But as I was looking up the stairs, something came crashing through the small basement window instead. My wife and daughter jumped, yelling.

“Get behind me!” I said, turning the gun in the direction of the noise. I saw what looked like a toddler, still wearing cartoon characters on his clothes. But something was very wrong with his body and face.

Tendrils of gray and red roots seemed to grow out of his body, criss-crossing across his skin. One eye cried blood as he looked at me, and the other had tiny, gray worms crawling out of it. I could still see his pupils, though, and apparently he could see me, for he began to run forward towards me at a superhuman speed.

His mouth was opened, letting blood-red vines with spikes shoot out in my direction. Even though I watched the spectacle with open-mouthed horror, my instincts still kicked in enough for me to know I needed to put him down. Without thinking, I fired a shot directly into his head.

He was so small that the exit wound of the slug blew the entire back of his head off. He fell back, as if in slow motion. I saw gray and red tendrils whipping around crazily, moving much faster and more erratically as he died. Some of them morphed at an increased rate, sending thorns and spikes shooting out, and others wrapped around the child’s body, as if trying to protect him from further damage. But it was too late.

Within seconds of him laying on the ground, the energy behind the tendrils seemed to weaken. The spikes receded back inside, and they began to fall randomly around and on top of his body, no longer moving. A few new smaller tendrils shot out from the bullet wound, but those also quickly lost energy, instead falling back into the blood and gore of his face.

Behind me, Sarah and Beth were still crying. I turned, seeing Sarah burying her face in Dr. Hoppy, trying not to look. Beth stared at me with wide, unseeing eyes. She reminded me of pictures I had seen of shell-shocked soldiers returning from a horrifying war.

In the excitement, I had forgotten about the basement door. I heard metal clattering from the direction of the door and then the lock slowly turned. The door swung open. And what I saw there was not another person possessed by the vines, like I had expected.

A robed man with a bone-white face stared down at me. His hands looked skeletal, almost like deformed claws, and his eyes were pure black. He smiled at me, an inhumanly wide grin that showed multiple blood-red tongues flicking in different directions.

“I have seen you,” he said in a voice that sounded like thousands of voices swarming and echoing on top of one another. “You will make it, Jason. I will return to you at the end of your journey. You are the only one with the ability to make it out of here.”

“What about my family?” I said, tears clouding my vision, pointing at my daughter and wife. The hooded man shrugged.

“That depends on your actions,” he said. “It is no concern of mine. My concern is that you make it out. Much relies on your survival. But I do not intercede with mortal affairs much. I only came to give you a warning…”

“What warning?” I asked, feeling frantic.

“Do not trust the man in white.” With that, he turned, beginning to walk away slowly. The black robe he wore rippled and shimmered as if it were made of silk.

“Wait! What’s your name?” I asked, but he ignored my question. I looked at my Beth and Sarah, who were staring at me, open-mouthed. Within seconds, the man’s footsteps faded into nothing.

“I think it’s time we got out of here,” I said to them. “Prepare a few backpacks with some food and water. We will have to split whatever we can carry between the three of us. I need to go get some things from upstairs before we leave, though. I think we might have a long journey ahead of us.” My wife nodded, going through the storage supplies and finding a few bags. I didn’t want to leave them alone for even an instant, so I stayed with them while she packed. We gave Sarah a small bag with a few cans of food and water. Sarah also put Dr. Hoppy in it.

“Sorry, Dr. Hoppy,” Sarah said, frowning as she zipped up the backpack. “I know you don’t like small spaces, but it is only for a little while.”

Beth and I split heavier bags with more food and water, but we didn’t overload them, as I had the feeling we might need to run.

After we finished preparing in the basement, we went upstairs. I saw bodies all over our kitchen. I recognized the bodies of our neighbors and a couple other people from town. They all had gray and red vines sticking out of their skin, unmoving. Some of them had blood pouring from both eyes, while others had mostly clear faces.

Regardless, it looked like the robed man had torn them limb from limb. There were arms with red vines coming out of the bones, decapitated heads with gray tendrils loosely hanging down from their throats, and other horrors I don’t want to reflect on here. I covered Sarah’s eyes as we led her past the carnage, going upstairs.

I found a phone up there, a special model with encryption and VPNs installed that I kept for emergencies. My technologically-savvy friend had given it to me, and now I tried turning it on and connecting. I was able to get through some of the government restrictions and connect to a weak internet source. No calls or texts would go through, however.

But I wanted to at least write up my story to let people know what’s happening. The government will almost certainly try to cover up what is happening in our town. I plan on getting my family out and letting the world know the truth, however- no matter the cost.
