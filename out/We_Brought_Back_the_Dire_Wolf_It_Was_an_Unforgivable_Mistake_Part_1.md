“We Brought Back the Dire Wolf. It Was an Unforgivable Mistake”

By Elliot T

(Part 1)

I probably shouldn’t be telling you any of this.

But I’ve always believed that morality matters more than rules—

and lately, my conscience has become a constant screaming presence in the back of my skull.

So screw it.

Here it goes.

My name is Alex, and I’m a genetic engineer.

I worked—no, I served—a biotech monolith called Gargantan.

If the name rings a bell, it’s probably because you remember that headline from back in 2025.

We made history by reviving the dire wolf—

a beast that had been extinct for over ten thousand years.

At the time, it was hailed as a marvel.

We were celebrated like scientific prophets, hailed as visionaries reshaping the timeline.

But that was then.

That was three years ago. 

And since then, we’ve gone further than we ever should have.

Not just beyond the line—

we paved a damn superhighway across it.

Woolly mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, dodo birds—those were warm-ups.

Dress rehearsals.

Child’s play, if you want the truth.

Because we didn’t stop at de-extinction.

We didn’t stop at enhancement.

We kept going.

We made them tougher.

Smarter.

Faster.

Predators no longer content with merely surviving in the ecosystem—

We’d rebirthed them as something else.

Something upgraded.

Something designed.

At first, they were surprisingly docile—

which, for research purposes, was a gift.

But if the plan was to release them into the wild to fix the planet,

if the long-term aim was improved biodiversity than apex predators cannot act as doves.

That passivity becomes a problem.

Still, I believed in the mission.

I thought we were doing something good.

I thought we were healing a wound the world had carried for too long.

I thought science could atone for man's tampering  .

But I’m not that naïve anymore.

What we created—what we unleashed—

was so far beyond horrifying that I don’t think I’ve truly felt safe since that day.

It all started at one of our off-the-books research facilities.

A black site nestled deep in the East Texas wilderness,

buried in trees and cloaked in silence just outside a dot-on-the-map town called Groveton.

The place was funded by men in tailored suits with deep pockets and zero patience for oversight.

They didn’t want science.

They wanted product.

So we built them a factory.

A lab with one goal: mass production.

We had already brought back dozens of extinct species, but they didn’t care about discovery.

They cared about scalability.

They wanted Jurassic Park, but real.

Profitable.

Marketable.

That’s why we built the Womb Room.

The chamber was bathed in cold, sterile blue light.

Rows of tall cylindrical tanks lined the walls like glass coffins. Inside each one floated something… unfinished.

Semi-formed creatures suspended in nutrient-rich amniotic fluid, continuously twitched the days away with unnatural spasms.

The life though not yet awake, but it was already unnerving.

Transparent tubing spiraled into the tanks like umbilical cords from hell. Day-by-day pumping in oxygen, hormones, accelerants.

Machines clicked and hummed, maintaining the illusion of gestation — condensing what should take months into just days.

The air smelled of disinfectant and copper.

"Imagine visiting a real-life Jurassic Park, Alex. A real place with real dinosaurs"

I remember Martin — our lab supervisor — saying.

"Only these dinosaurs you can take home with you. Dinosaurs that are the size of a fox, but with the temperament of a golden retriever. Imagine it..."

I remember thinking he was out of his damn mind.

"That sounds like tampering with Mother Nature to me, Martin," I told him — half-joking, half not.

He just smirked, like he always did when someone brought up ethics.

"Tampering with Mother Nature is exactly what we do, Alex. It’s in the job description.

You don’t want another murder fungus episode, do you? What was it — the whole cohort? Hell, the whole terrarium?"

"That wasn’t a terrarium," Lisa muttered from across the lab, not even looking up from her tablet. "That was a goddamn slaughterhouse."

"C’mon, it’s not like we meant for that to happen. Besides, you learn more from mistakes than successes. Some times lesses are dished out one blood-soaked rodent enclosure at a time." Martin said shrugging

"I thought we agreed not to bring that up anymore," I said, sounding sharper than I intended.

Martin raised his hands in mock surrender.

"Alright, alright. Sensitive topic. Got it."

Then, glancing at me with that shit-eating grin:

"Go take care of feeding duty. Cool off. Take the rest of the day if you want. No hard feelings."

"I suppose that means I’m on feeding duty too?" Lisa asked, glancing up at me.

"You have to ask?" I smirked, trying to shake the mood.

We stepped into the corridor — wide, cold, and endless — the heavy door thudding shut behind us with a hiss of pressurized air.

The halls of the Gargantan facility always felt… wrong.

Even for a building that size — several hundred thousand square feet and hidden miles off any known road — it felt deserted.

It felt too quiet. Too sterile.

The kind of place that swallowed sound.

As we passed one of the industrial blast doors marked G-WING, both of us instinctively averted our eyes. The sign bolted across it urgently  read:

"RESTRICTED ACCESS – LEVEL 5 CLEARANCE ONLY – VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED"

The sensor array above it clicked softly as we walked by — a gentle reminder that something was watching. Beyond that door, no one really knew what went on. No janitors. No assistants. Just a handful of high-clearance personnel and a whole lot of bad rumors.

Lisa slowed her pace, her eyes locked on the armored glass window next to the door — one that had long since been frosted over from the inside. No visibility. No sound. Just a faint warmth radiating from the seams, as if something unnatural lived and breathed behind it.

"Still gives me the creeps," she muttered.

"It should," I said. "They say whatever they’re growing in there doesn’t sleep."

Lisa gave me a look. "They also said the dire wolves wouldn’t be aggressive unless provoked."

We both went quiet.

"You think Martin has access?" I asked, watching the tiny indicator light switch from blue to red.

Lisa snorted. "Martin probably runs G-Wing. Wouldn’t surprise me if he pitched the whole thing."

"You ever hear what they’re actually doing in there?"

"Nope. And I don’t want to. It’s way above our pay grade, Alex. We're better off not knowing."

"Yeah. Right up until whatever it is comes crawling out."

Lisa turned and started walking again. "If it crawls, we shoot it. If it talks, we run."

"Great. I feel so safe now."

As we moved on, I glanced back once more at that door. No windows. No sounds. Just a faint warmth bleeding from the seams — the kind of heat that didn’t feel biological.

It felt hungry.

Lisa and I continued down the winding corridors, the fluorescent lights above buzzing softly, casting our shadows long across the sterile floors. The deeper we went, the more the air took on a subtle musk — animal, earthy, and unmistakably alive.

Eventually, we reached the feeding pens — a series of reinforced enclosures arranged like a twisted zoo exhibit. Inside them were living relics of the past: woolly mammoths, their matted coats swaying gently as they breathed; dodo birds, oddly placid and dumb-eyed; a pair of saber-toothed tigers, pacing like coiled muscle and teeth; Tasmanian tigers, twitchy and ever watchful. And, of course… the dire wolves.

Six of them lounged inside their pen, eyes tracking us with a mix of recognition and ancient predatory instinct.

We started with the wolves first — always first. Argus, Gaia, and Lydia — the trio we’d raised from pups. They were still technically experimental creatures, but over the years they’d become… familiar. Almost family. They’d let us scratch behind their ears, even lick our hands if they were in a good mood.

But today… something felt wrong.

"Do Argus’s eyes look… copper to you?" I asked, squinting through the reinforced glass.

Lisa didn’t even look. "Copper? Seriously? You’re not still hung up on that murder fungus crap, are you?"

"Kind of looks like the first stages though and I don't know of any other bioluminescence that do that." I replied, watching Argus pace with a jittery energy   . "Plus They kinda seem more amped than usual."

Lisa sighed and pulled open a heavy walk-in fridge. She disappeared for a moment, then rolled out a stainless steel cart stacked high with bloody steaks, the smell of raw meat immediately pulling the wolves’ attention.

"Feeding time, boys and girls," she said, unlocking the pass-through slot in the pen gate.

I started tossing steaks through the bars. Normally, they caught some but most of them would end up on the ground.

Not today. Today everything about them seemed... Agro. As soon as feeding began were like lunging towards the slabs catching them in their mouths like dogs going for a Frisbee.

"Yeah, they do seem wired," Lisa muttered, eyes narrowing as she watched the chaotic feast unfold. "And their eyes... That’s not normal, but do you really think it's bio-luminescence from the spores?"

"It would take a blood test to know fore sure, but I couldn't tell if Argus was going for the steak or my damn hand." "You wanna try petting them today?"

"Hard pass."

I glanced over and noticed Lydia standing apart from the rest, as if the calm center in an otherwise tumultuous storm. She was always the calmest — the surrogate mother, the one who carried the embryos for the entire litter. If the others were erratic, she was the anchor. Always had been.

"Lydia?" I called gently, approaching the bars.

To my delight she turned her head slowly, her amber eyes also displayed a hint of the same crimson but she was not acting like the others. She padded over as our eyes met, seeming as calm as ever, tail swaying gently. She pressed her head against the bars, inviting a scratch behind the ear.

"See?" Lisa said, her voice easing a little. "If Lydia’s still chill, it’s probably just a fluke, or some other cause for the copper eyes."

I gave her a slow, tentative pet, and Lydia responded with a low, almost soothing whuff.

"Maybe. Still… something’s off," I murmured.

Lisa wiped her hands with a rag, already halfway toward the exit. "Well, let’s hope it’s nothing. I’m done for the day."

"Yeah. See you tomorrow."

As she left, I lingered just a little longer, watching Lydia slink back to the others — who were now huddled in a tight, twitching mass. I’d seen animals act strangely before. But this wasn’t just strange.

This was wrong.

I climbed into my car, shut the door, and let out a long breath as the engine hummed to life. Before I’d even pulled out of the lot, I was already spiraling — swallowed whole by the emotional maelstrom churning in my head.

Thoughts collided and tangled: What were we really creating back there? How far had we gone? How far was too far?

I hadn’t gotten into this field to play Frankenstein. I’d wanted to heal the planet — to use science to undo some of the damage humanity had wrought. But somewhere along the way, that noble vision had gotten buried under classified memos and morally gray directives. Now I was just another cog in the machine, playing second fiddle to a man who practically embodied the term "mad scientist."

Ethical implications aside… the pay was solid. And I had a mortgage.

The Gargantan Research Facility sat in the deep woods of East Texas, nestled in a place so remote it felt like the map itself tried to forget it. “Secluded” didn’t quite do it justice. The nearest cluster of anything resembling civilization was a speck of a town called Groveton, ten miles up the highway. And calling Groveton a “town” was charitable.

They had a city hall — more like a brick shed — a gas station, a Dollar Store, and a handful of houses scattered like someone dropped them from the sky. That was it. No coffee shops, no bookstores, no paved side walks. Just pine trees, porch swings, and a sky that seemed a little too wide.

Not really my kind of place. But I’d rented a tiny bungalow on the edge of town for the sake of the short commute.

As I rolled past the police station — a damaged county sign swaying in the breeze — I found myself replaying the day’s events. The wolves' strange behavior. The flicker of copper in the Dire Wolves' eyes. Lydia's anatomy and the persistent manic energy that was in the air.

Could it be connected somehow? A flare-up of some long-dormant pathogen? Something like… the murder fungus?

I shook the thought away.

That chapter was supposed to be closed.

But deep down, I knew better.

I was on edge the next morning — nerves twitching just under the surface — but I tried to push it down and throw myself into the work. Distraction through productivity, or whatever they say.



My task was routine, at least on paper: a genomic reconstruction on Argus, one of our more stable dire wolves. The goal was ambitious but straightforward — eliminate the need for surrogate mothers entirely and engineer self-sustaining embryo growth from the genetic level up.

But as I combed through the data, something stopped me cold.

There, buried in the genome, was a repeating sequence I’d seen before. A distinct signature — eerie in its synchronicity — too similar to be coincidence.

It mirrored the murder fungus.

I won’t bore you with gene maps or sequence markers — this wasn’t something that took a PhD to spot. It stuck out like a hooker at Sunday service. A foreign code fragment that didn’t belong, waving at me like a red flag that was fire.

The label slapped onto it didn’t help: "Synthetic Control."

That’s it. No further notes. No details. Just a vague, dismissive tag like that was supposed to make everything okay.

My stomach knotted. What the hell was a synthetic control doing inside Argus? And more importantly… was this proof that the murder fungus was never truly eradicated?

If it was still alive, or worse — integrated — was I now complicit in whatever came next?

The guilt itched at me. But more than that, the curiosity burned. I had to know the truth. I had to see it for myself.

So, when Martin left for one of his “classified” phone calls, I slipped into his office, heart thudding, and grabbed his spare swipe badge from behind the cabinet — right where he always left it, the arrogant bastard.

Then I made a beeline for the one place I swore I’d never go:

G Wing

My hands trembled as I stepped into the forbidden frontier that was G Wing. The stolen badge felt like a lead weight in my grip. I scanned it against the card reader, and the door unlocked with a heavy mechanical hiss, like the facility itself was exhaling a warning.

Inside was a world unto itself—an underground cathedral to scientific blasphemy. I expected a cold hallway or a lab office. Instead, I found a massive, dimly lit chamber, stretching far beyond what should’ve been possible based on the exterior. One side of the room housed reinforced glass enclosures, each holding living, breathing things that defied classification. The other side contained towering fluid-filled tanks, where grotesque chimeric monstrosities floated in eerie suspension, bathed in blue light like specimens from a nightmare.

The unease in my chest only grew as I approached the first enclosure. These weren’t ancient resurrections or modest cross-species edits. They weren’t even distant cousins in the genetic tree stitched together with CRISPR. These were something far worse—something new. Things the world had never seen… and never should have.

Exhibit One: "The Stalker"

(Wolf-Arachnid Hybrid)

Base Genome: Dire Wolf + Camel Spider

What stared back at me looked like a muscular wolf, but it was wrong in every way that mattered. Its head was broader, and where canine eyes should have been, clusters of gleaming arachnid eyes shimmered in the dim light—offering it a 360-degree view of its surroundings. Its fur seemed to ripple with each breath, like it was woven from tension itself. When it moved, it did so with impossible silence—fluid, predatory, terrifying.

I read the placard beneath it.

Neurotoxic bite. Engineered venom. Lightning-fast ambush predator.

I backed away involuntarily, whispering to myself, “A poisonous wolf with panoramic vision. Fantastic. What possible use could this have outside of horror movies or war zones?”

The next pen held something worse.

Exhibit Two: "The Mind Eater"

(Cephalopod-Corvid Hybrid)

Base Genome: Octopus + Raven

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It perched on a twisted metal branch like a bird, but its wings ended in writhing membranes. Its torso pulsed with the oily texture of cephalopod skin, and several tentacles dangled from beneath it like living roots. The creature cocked its head and locked eyes with me, then mimicked a human laugh—my laugh—from just seconds earlier.

I froze.

Without warning, it launched itself towards me. Its tentacles splayed outward, trying to encase my head. A hooked, bone-colored beak attempted to penetrate my cranium but was denied due to the glass that sat between us.

I read the placard:

Cranial puncture and extraction behavior observed. High intelligence. Vocal mimicry. Cognitive mapping of handlers likely.

“So… flying face huggers,” I muttered, bile rising in my throat. I staggered back, pressing a hand to my stomach, trying not to lose it.

Exhibit Three: "The Sporebringer"

(Bear-Fungal Symbiote Hybrid)

Base Genome: Grizzly Bear + Cordyceps Fungus

The last pen was the worst of them all.

It stood nearly nine feet tall, bloated and hunched under the weight of its own fungal mass. Its fur was patchy, with pulsing colonies of cordyceps bursting through its skin like tumors. The thing reeked, even through the thick glass. Parts of its body twitched independently—fungal limbs sprouting from its back like necrotic wings, flailing with no rhythm, no reason.

The placard confirmed my fear:

aerosolized spores induce paralysis, hallucination, and loss of motor control. Secondary infection through open wounds. Ecosystem destabilization risk: EXTREME.

My mind reeled. This was no coincidence. This was proof.

The murder fungus… it was never eradicated. It had been weaponized to new extremes and now even baked into the genome of these new hybrids.

I slammed my fist against the glass in frustration, rage, and disbelief. The beast inside didn’t even flinch. It just turned toward me slowly—no eyes, just fungal stalks—and let out a low, wet groan, like it was amused.

My blood ran cold.

These weren’t weapons. They were monsters.

Suddenly, my intense contemplation was shattered by a callous yet almost carefree voice behind me.

“Beautiful, aren’t they, Alex?”

I turned sharply.

There he was—Martin. Grinning like a man who had finally revealed the punchline to a joke only he understood. The unnatural calm in his eyes unnerved me more than the creatures behind the glass.

Given what I’d just been caught doing—stealing his badge, breaking into G Wing—I probably should’ve apologized. But I couldn’t. My mind was still reeling from what I’d seen.

I stepped toward him instead, clenching my fists.

“Who the hell are we working for, Martin? Getting results for investors is one thing, but this? This is madness. I didn’t sign up to work on the goddamn Island of Dr. Moreau. What the fuck are these things?!”

Martin chuckled. A slow, sinister laugh.

“You still don’t get it,” he said, voice thick with pride and menace. “Similar Genetic Synthesis? Quantum DNA sequencing? That's just child’s play. You’ve been working in the kiddie pool, my boy.”

He began pacing in front of the tanks, gesturing toward the abominations behind the glass.

“We’ve gone way past resurrecting mammoths and tweaking ancient DNA.”

He stopped and turned to me, his smile widening.

“Do you know what we’ve done here, Alex? We've perfect Cross-Phylum Genetic Synthesis. We are no longer limited to vertebrates, or even mammals. We’ve cracked the universal genome architecture. We can now combine up to three genomes from any living organism on Earth.”

"But this is dangerous Martin. You have no idea what effect these beings might have on the ecosystem, or hell, when might might start eating people for lunch."

"That concern had been removed. I'll show y-..."

"Even still..." I interjected, cutting him off.

"These are monstrosities. You're making real life xenomorphs. What purpose could these — 'things' — possibly serve?

"There's only a limited amount of money in entertainment Alex. The real bacon is in DEFENSE. Imagine, never having to risk a human life in a war again? Isn't that worth it?!"

"Fine, okay, I get that. But if we deployed these things in the field, who's to say that they won't just eat their own support teams, or surrounding civilians?"

Martin (grinning):

“You’re still thinking like a mammal, Alex. Nervous systems? Gene selection modifications?Outdated. What we’re using now is fungal telemetry.”

Martin:

"Although this is above top secret, I will tell you anyway. I mean, I would have never accomplished this without you, and your wonderful fungus."

I swallowed hard, almost choking. "Wha, what do you mean, Martin?!"

“The murder fungus wasn’t just a fluke — it was the missing piece. It doesn’t just infect the brain. It rewires it. The fungus integrates into the host’s nervous system, forming protein sheaths around existing synapses.  All infected creatures become part of a decentralized network."

"Come on Martin. It's true that it alters brain chemistry, but it's not some kind of receiver antenna."

"Silence! The time for words is over... Behold!"

Martin reached into his coat pocket and produced a strange headband rigged with microchips, neural mesh, and blinking circuits.

“But that’s not even the best part,” Martin said with a glint in his eye. “With this—our Neural Command Interface—we’ve linked their neural pathways to remote behavioral controls. In short, total obedience.”

He pulled out a PlayStation controller with casual flair, as if showing off a party trick. With a flick of the D-pad, the monstrous fungal bear within the tank began to sway left and right in sync.

“See?” he said with childlike delight. “It’s like playing a video game. Isn’t it remarkable?”

I stared in disbelief.

"Also, pressing square performs the swipe attack, X will make him jump. Want to try, Alex?

Martin held up the controller where I could see it and began tapping the X key. The bear responded with a roar and began attempting to slash at the glass enclosure.

Martin let out a malicious laugh. "Want to see his ultimate attack?!"

I was flabbergasted.

"You've completely enslaved them."

"No Alex, I have harnessed them. There just recombinant DNA. More accurately, they're called. RBDs. Remote Biological Drones. The future of warfare."

“Martin… You don’t know what this will cause. You really think we should be playing God?”

He turned to me, eyes wild.

“Playing God? You misunderstand, boy.” He stepped closer, eyes glowing with mania. “We. Are. God.”

But the moment the words left his lips, the lights in the lab snapped off.

Everything went black and we found ourselves in a thick abyss.

My heart surged into my throat as I fell silent gripping my fist and teeth together in tandem. Out of pure instinct, I began stepping backward, adrenaline still flooding my every nerve.

Then—click—the emergency lights kicked in, casting a dim red glow across the room.

Just as I thought I had my bearings back, a deafening THUD struck the glass behind me. I spun around. The Mind Eater had hurled itself against the glass enclosure once again. How does anyone get used to that?

Martin barely flinched. “Relax. They can’t escape.”

But a flat, emotionless voice crackled over the intercom.

“Level Five Breach in effect. Please secure all pens and initiate containment protocols.”

My blood froze.

“This gives me a really bad feeling,” I said, my voice low. “And I really don’t want to be right about this.”

By Elliot T

(Part 2)

Martin gave me a mock-innocent smile and waved toward the corridor.

“Would you be a dear and handle that for me?”

I didn’t wait for clarification. I bolted.

My thoughts spun as I sprinted through the sterile corridors toward the main terminal. All I wanted was more time to process what I’d just seen, to understand the monsters we were keeping—but now I had to worry about one being loose.

I slammed into the console and pulled up the security feed.

Breach confirmed. Location: Feeding Pens.

Of course it was.

I stared at the screen, watching as a hulking shadow moved in the far end of the pen corridor.

“Great,” I muttered, already running again. “Exactly what I needed today. A prehistoric hybrid loose in the wild. What could possibly go wrong?”

The emergency sirens continued to blare, their shrill wails bouncing off the walls as I sprinted down the winding corridors. The flickering red emergency lights made the place feel more like a horror movie set than a cutting-edge research facility.

I nearly collided with Lisa at the junction by Lab C.

“What the hell is happening?” she asked, her eyes wide with panic.

“Where do I even start?” I said, barely slowing down. “There’s been a breach in the feeding pens. At least one of the animals is loose.”

We didn’t need to say more. We both knew how bad that could be.

We reached the pen chamber and froze in our tracks.

One of the Dire Wolf enclosures was torn open—the steel reinforced bars twisted and bent like they were made of tinfoil. The interior was empty. Just a dented feeding tray and claw marks on the wall.

“That’s not good,” I muttered. “Which one was it?”

Lisa didn’t hesitate. “It’s Argus. He’s the one that broke out.”

I stared at the mangled cage.

“I know they’re strong, but those bars are titanium. How the hell did he get through that?”

“You got me…” Lisa said, clearly rattled. “But let’s just say—your ‘murder fungus’ theory is gaining ground by the minute.”

I shook my head. “I can’t think of anything else that could explain it.” Not sure how much I should disclose about G wing.



We stood there for a beat—just long enough for dread to fully settle in.

“But we don’t have time to sit here and theorize,” I said. “There’s no telling what kind of chaos that thing could unleash. It MUST be contained. By any means necessary.”

She nodded grimly.

Though we were just researchers, Gargantan did have contingency protocols. The facility kept a modest armory on-site—mostly tranquilizers and a few small arms for worst-case scenarios. Apparently, this was one of them.

We rushed to the weapons locker. Lisa punched in the code while I paced like a caged animal.

The door clicked open.

I grabbed a shotgun off the rack, loaded it with shaking hands, then stuffed as many extra shells as I could into my jeans pockets and threw some more in my pack. Every click of the rounds sliding into the chamber felt like a countdown ticking down to something I didn’t want to face, but at least I was armed.

I exhaled and muttered under my breath, “Please, don’t make me kill Argus…”

Lisa silently checked her tranquilizer rifle. Her expression was grim—focused.

This wasn’t just science anymore.

This was survival.

Lisa and I made a beeline for the facility’s parking garage and jumped into one of the company-issued Hummers. There were two in total—the other one had a mounted chaingun on top, but unfortunately, our clearance only granted us the standard model. Still, it could’ve been worse.

I slid into the driver’s seat and fired it up while Lisa climbed in beside me, immediately tapping through the touchscreen console like a woman on a mission.

“You got a fix on him?” I asked, flooring it out of the garage like a NASCAR driver hitting the straightaway.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“Give me a sec… The weather might interfere with the signal on his chip... wait. Got it,” she said, eyes glued to the display.  “He’s in the Northeast Pines, just outside Gaveton. Damn, he's moving fast.”

“Take it easy,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “At least he hasn’t made it into a populated area.”

“Yeah,” she said, nodding slowly. “That’s true.”

We followed the coordinates through winding back roads and rough terrain until even the Hummer couldn’t handle it. Thick roots and uneven ground forced us to a stop.

I pulled up beside a tree and killed the engine.

“This is it,” I said, grabbing the shotgun from the back seat. “From here, we walk…”

"You know how to use that thing?" Lisa said in a challenging manner.

"Relax. I served in the guard for a few years... I can handle myself."

"Really?!" Lisa said sounding surprised.

"What you think because I'm a bleeding heart, I can't handle myself?"

"Nah, I just never pictures you killing anything."

"Truthfully, I hate it. Especially with Argas. I pray we can find some way to subdue him, but I'm not optimistic."

"We've got try try." Lisa said gripping her tranq rifle.

But I didn't respond as if sensing the futility.

As we pushed deeper into the forest, an oppressive stillness settled over us. The air felt heavy—charged—with the distinct sense that we were being watched. Every step stirred the underbrush, but nothing else moved. It was like the woods themselves were holding their breath.

It took a minute before either of us could put the unease into words.

“Psst. Lisa,” I whispered, keeping my voice low. “Does this place feel… off to you?”

“Yeah,” she murmured. “It’s too quiet.”

“I mean, sure, we’re in the middle of nowhere—but it’s like nature’s been… muted,” I said, scanning the treetops. “No birds, no insects. Even the cicadas have shut up.”

“It’s like the forest is gagged,” she agreed, her voice tense. “Something’s wrong.”

“Yeah,”“Let’s just find Argus and get the hell out of here. How's the GPS look?"

"Just a few more clicks northeast.” She replied as we continued deeper into the heart of the pines.

But the deeper we moved into the forest, the more ominous the signs became.

The first was a white-tailed deer lying sprawled across the undergrowth, its throat torn wide open. Lisa spotted it first.

“Alex,” she called, her voice tight. “Over here.”

We rushed over. I knelt beside the carcass and touched its side. Still warm.

“I’ve got a bad feeling about this,” I said. “This was a fresh kill.”

“Yeah,” Lisa replied, eyes narrowing. “But it’s how it was killed that gets me. There’s not a single bite taken out of it. No feeding—just a clean kill. Like an execution.”

“Execution?” I scoffed. “Lisa, don’t be dramatic. Even apex predators like Argus don’t kill for sport. That’s a human concept.”

She stared at the deer for a moment longer. “Hey, I’m just calling it like I see it.”

We pressed on, but the forest only grew more disturbing.

Following Argus’ microchip signal, the next grisly scene was a clearing littered with decapitated wild turkeys—their bodies still twitching in the dirt, heads nowhere in sight. Further ahead, we found a small pack of coyotes, torn apart. Whatever had done this didn’t just kill—it annihilated.

“Think it’s the murder fungus?” Lisa asked, crouching beside one of the bodies.

"I've don't know anything else that makes animals into kamikaze psychos."

“The turkeys make sense. but killing coyotes? I've never seen that.”

One of the coyotes was still clinging to life, barely breathing. I dropped to my knees beside it.

“Alex, it’s dying. We don’t have time—”

“I know. But I need a blood sample,” I said, already reaching for a syringe. “Give me a hand.”

Lisa knelt beside me and stroked the animal’s fur to keep it calm while I inserted the needle. I filled two vials, capped them, and tucked them into a protective case before shoving it into my pack.

Then came the snakes.

Several king cobras, split clean down the middle, were strewn across a log—glistening in the half-light. Oddly, we counted three tails… and only two heads.

That part, somehow, disturbed us more than the blood.

We emerged from the trees onto a narrow gravel road, nestled between foothills and thick vegetation. The GPS signal began flickering wildly.

“He’s close,” Lisa said, her voice hushed.

But then… we heard it.

A howl.

Not like anything living—or extinct—should have been made. It wasn’t just loud; it carved through the trees like a blade. A blend of agony, rage, and something else… something unnatural, almost demonic. The sound sent a spike of ice through my spine.

We froze in the road. I scanned the trees.  My heart was pounding as I toggled the shotgun's safety off with a tense finger.

At first I saw nothing.

And then—there.

I saw him.

Argus.
