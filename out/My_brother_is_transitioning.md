Me and my brother Nick have never been close. It’s nothing personal, I just don’t like him very much. He’s tall, brash, abrasive, stinks like a horse and has the face to match. Before you call me a bully, Nick doesn't like me very much either. That's just how it is, he's the big brother, I'm the little one.

So you’d imagine my surpise when we were eating breakfast together, watching the TV, and he told me, “Tom, I think I’m transitioning.”

I looked him up and down. “What?” 

He wrapped his lanky arms around his ribs shyly. “Yeah I’ve been feeling this way for a while, y’know, body dysmorphia and stuff, and I think I want a change.”

I just frowned and continued to herd my Rice Crispies round the bowl with my spoon. I wouldnt know what that meant exactly until later that night. Even without looking I could feel Nick gazing at me.

“Does it bother you?” He asked

“No.” I replied tersely

“It’s okay if it does.”

“Do you what you want, I don’t give one.” I threw the middle finger for effect, blowing a raspberry .

Blush crept up his neck before he turned away. He stood and I managed to catch one last glimpse of him before he stormed off: a small, red incision running down his temple.

I didn’t see Nick again for a while. He’d locked himself in his room, mumbling angrily to himself. As I pressed my ear up against his bedroom door I could hear clearer, though it was just a string of moans and wet noises like slapping a soaked towel against a window, not necessarily decipherable. 

At dinner time I had to make my food on my own, and had to tuck myself into the table even though my feet hardly reached the floor. Mum and Dad were out at a wedding party and Nick still hadn’t left his room. He was always the first to gobble up dinner so he could run back to his room and play videogames.

I left the dinner table and marched back to Nick’s room. The door was still shut but the noises had grown louder. He wasn’t just whimpering, he was moaning in pain. Banging on the door I shouted for him. 

I dropped to the ground, trying to peek under the space under the door. His lamplight seeped through but I could not see any sign of him.

The door handle was too high for me to reach, even if I stretched my arm all the way out and was on the very tips of my toes. I took a couple steps back so I was right up against the hallway wall before charging forward towards the door, leaping at the last second for the handle. My fingers just brushed it.

Licking my lips I was determined to try again, I planted my palms against the wall, one foot lifted into the air and charged forward again, taking off and catching the handle. I yanked downwards and pulled it towards me. The door shifted and swung open, just missing me as I let go of the handle.

I struggled to comprehend what I was seeing.

In the dim lamplight Nick was moaning, not from pain, but feverish *pleasure.* He was almost completely nude aside from a pair of navy boxer shorts, sweat covered his body like oil, gleaming against the light. His thin, pimple-dotted back was arched from the ground toes curled, fingers grabbing and ripping up the fibers of the rug. I could see the muscles in his neck pronounced, clenching and relaxing in waves. 

I stood cautiously in the doorway, not quite sure on what to do.

Nick seemed to notice be, even with his eyes rolled into the back of his head. Still moaning, he turned to me and said, “come here, won’t you?”

Against my better judgement, I did. I stood over him, watching his pale face writhe as if maggots wriggled under his skin. He was so pale his skin was transculent, I could see his teeth grinding against eachother through his cheek. 

“Don’t cry.” He whispered

I felt tears slip down my cheek and wiped them away quickly. 

“I need you to get my knife and cut down my chest here—“ he circled the pulsing spot between his ribcage— “one straight, clean cut… I’d do it but…” he began to hyperventilate, “but…” he gasped softly, mouth bobbing up and down like a dehydrated fish.

I went over to his pillow and the pocket knife that lay on it, unsheathed. Taking it in my shaky hands I brought it over to my brother and did as he instructed.

First I softly pressed the blade against his diaphragm, looked up at him for confirmation before continuing with the cut.

I'd never cut a living being before, or a dead being for that matter. It was like cutting a cake, or at least that's what I repeated to myself as the blood began to spill out from him.

"Keep going," he whispered, watching me with wide, dialated eyes, "a little deeper, just to the navel, that's enough, that's all I need."

I was whimpering myself as the blood gushing from him pooled at my knees, turning my blue *Thomas The Tank Engine* themed trousers a dark shade of violet.

Finally, the knife cut through the belly button and tossed the knife away from me, it clattered against the wall.

My heart was drumming out of my chest hoping I did it right, whatver *it* was. Nick was still seizuring on the ground, but now he was completely silent. Yellow foam bubbled at his lips, his arms twitched violently, grabbing the air.

The incision I'd made was pulsing more violently now as if something was trying to get out, blood spurting out of it like a fountain, spraying across the ceiling. I covered my head with my arms, wailing in fear, wanting more than anything to be back in the dining room.

Suddenly, Nick jolted upwards, all limbs actually leaving the floor, as a red hand burst through his skin. Flesh rained down around me, the stench of putrid meat filled the room -- I gagged.

The hand was tearing Nick away from it, peeling him back like an orange peel. Another hand emerged, snapping his head back against his spine. Finally, a head emerged from the pool of blood. It was completely bald with brown eyes as large as a doe. It was also completely blue, just like my *Thomas The Tank Engine* themed pyjamas before I got Nick all over them.

It slithered out from him, legs clambering clumsily over the edge of his ribs. As it's tail left him, Nick had become deflated and all that remained was this new thing.

Shock rendered me speechless, but New Nick didn't seem too worse for wear. He twisted his new form in the mirror, smiling with a lipless mouth.

He was at least three foot taller than Old Nick, had an extra pair of arms at his waist, though hardly the size of a newborns, and as I mentioned before, blue and bald.

"I'll run you a bath in a minute, Tom." Was all he said to me, not even looking, but I was already out the room.

Later, he did run me a bath. After, he sat me at the dinner table and tucked me in. The whole time he told me what a good brother I was, and how if I ever needed anything I could rely on him. I asked him if he could get the bloodstains out of my trousers and he said no.

"I know how scary it was but you did very well Tom. And I know how scary I look now but I'll be fine by tomorrow, you'll see, it's just a part of transitioning, you'll go through it too, someday."

I nodded silently.

"Are you scared of me?" He asked, rapidly blinking sideways

I shook my head.

With another smile he tussled my hair and returned to his room.

I sat up in bed hoping to hear the sound Dad's wagon pulling up into the driveway. My bedtime came and passed. Midnight came and passed. My eyelids grew heavy and I eventually nodded off.

My brother is transitioning — but I don’t know into what.
