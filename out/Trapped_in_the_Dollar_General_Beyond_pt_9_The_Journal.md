Hey everyone, I hope these are still coming through.

My cell phone hasn’t needed a charge in a while, and seems to be stuck on 70%. It’s a shame. One more and I’d definitely have grounds for some internet points, heh. It still displays weird times and dates, and no one has answered any of my messages or commented on any of these posts, at least on my end. 

Gale hasn’t come back yet, but it's only been a little bit since the thing with the Hermit.

No, that's not right.

It’s only been a little bit since we were forced to kill the old man who resided in FF.

I‘ve started reading the journal, but I know now that it isn’t his.

The journal belongs to someone named C, and I suspect that Gale will be very interested in seeing it when he gets back.

I say this because I’m pretty sure that the writer is Celene

I’ll write down a few of the entries and let you judge for yourself, but it sounds like this person has gone farther than even Gale has been.

Day 1

This is the first day I’ve started keeping this journal. I’ve figured out how to take it with me, and I’m experimenting to see if I can take other things with me as well. I had to find the gaudiest one I could find, I’m pretty sure it's got unicorns on it, so that I could visualize it and that seems to be the secret. I kind of accidentally stumbled across it when I was going through one of the doors with a candybar in my hand. I could see myself eating it, and when I stepped through, it came too. I was halfway through the Snickers before it hit me that I still had it. Everything else I had tried to take with me was left behind, and I have the feeling this might be the start of something big. 

Day 2

I visited twelve new Dollar Generals today. It’s weird, some of them have odd things in them, futuristic things that I’ve never heard of. I found one that sold cigarettes today. Can you imagine a DG that sells tobacco? The “tobacco” however turned out to be these weird vaporizers. It still gave me nicotine, but it was definitely a head rush. I hadn’t had a smoke in…God its been a while. It was a nice treat.

Day 5

I saw a store where everything was upside down today. It made me kind of dizzy.

Day 7

I managed to take a backpack with me to a new store today. All the stuff inside disappeared, for some reason, but the backpack came with me (as well as my journal) so that's a start. 

Day 8

I managed to take things with me to another store today. Normally it helps if you visualize all of them, but its better if you just see the bag when you take them with you. No clue why, but it seems to work. I’ll have to experiment with it some more. I had to go through seven stores before I got it to travel with me. Some of them are pretty weird, but the one thing missing from them are people. I haven’t seen a single soul since I left Gale behind, and I wake up sometimes hoping to see him standing over me. I miss him, I miss the others, I miss the sound of people talking, laughing, just existing. The stores are much too quiet for my liking.

When I read that, I had to go back and read it again. Once I read the name Gale, I knew this had to be his lost friend. If she was alive, though, then how had the old hermit gotten her journal? Given the reception we had always gotten from him, it was unlikely that she had been welcomed warmly. Had he killed her? Were her bones part of the garbage that littered the store?

I had to read more.

Day 10

I saw weird shadows today when I went through the door. They were walking around a weird store, and there were stalls of meat just sitting around. The meat looked very questionable, and when one of the shadows grabbed me, I pulled free and made a run for it. I suspect the bins had human meat in them.

Day 11

Came upon a dark store lit by lamps. I didn’t like it so I didn’t stay long. It made me think of the thing that took Margo and wonder if it lived there.

That entry sort of sealed it for me, and I skimmed ahead a little to see if I could find some place new.

Day 19

Found a weird store with a burnt out ceiling near the door. The whole place seemed weird and I don’t like anywhere with an exposed ceiling. I moved on quickly and the next one surprised me. It was under water! I came out swimming, and though I panicked a little, I didn’t drown. I swam around, seeing a few fish, but I saw something big as I got near the back and made my way out. I expected I would have to dry out when I came through, but my clothes and my things were dry when I came out in a Christmas Themed Store.

Day 20

Still in the Christmas store, but I’ve been thinking about trying to travel backwards. There has to be a way to go back, doesn’t there? Gale hasn’t caught up, maybe he never left, and I don’t know how long I’ve been traveling. Days? Weeks? Years? Who knows. It doesn’t seem to matter. Time is weird here, and I can’t really tell how long I’ve been here. My wrist watch just blinks 88:88 at me but when I go to another store it always appears on my arm when I take it off. Maybe I’l experiment a little and see if I can go back the way I came.

Day 30

After ten days of trial and error, I finally did it. I was picturing this store I went to once, the store made of candy and sweets, and when I walked through, I was there! I was so happy that I jumped for joy. Now I just have to make it back to the original store so I can see what happened to Gale. I hope he’s still alive.

Day 45

No matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to go back. I’ve been trying for days, well for periods after sleep, and it’s no good. The store was kind of unremarkable, and I can’t seem to get a good picture of it in my mind. I have to keep trying, I have to keep picturing it. I know I can do it. I know I can make it. I have to go back. I have to find him.

There were a lot of entries after that. The writer, Celene, either went forward through the loop or went back to similar DGBs. She was steadfast in her efforts, wanting to see Gale again, but the more she tried, the more discouraged she got. She started writing about how it might be impossible to go back to places you had started at. She began to wonder if there was an end to the stores? Slowly, she lost  track of time. The days stopped mattering, the days ran together, an her contemplations began to pile up.

She mused a lot, perfected her traveling, and eventually, she was rewarded.

Today

I DID IT! I went back to the first store! I remembered this end cap we had made, “Meet the Team” where we had posted things about ourselves. It was just pictures and stories and little personal blurbs, but it gave me something to focus on and I was suddenly standing in the old store. I used to hate when the flash of Margo’s instant camera would catch me off guard, but when I saw that board with all our pictures and stories on it, I started crying. We had hoped that someone would find it if anything happened to us, but it looks like I had used it as a way back home!

I expected to see Gale sitting there, but he wasn’t. I figured he would look up and tell me I had just left and ask why I had come back so soon? Instead, he was gone. I did see his sign, however, and I went to the break room and found his memorial for us. He thinks I’m lost, just like Rudy and Kenneth and Margo, but now I’m looking for him. I have to find him, the stores can’t be that numerous. There has to be an end, and if anyone has found it, I’m sure it’s Gale. He’ll be looking for it, or me, as we speak, and I have to find him so I can team up and help him find the end.

I felt myself tear up a little as I read it. She had done it! She had come back to where it all started! If she was looking, though, how had she never found Gale? The stores were numerous, but they had to have crossed paths at some point    

I began to wonder how long Gale had been gone, and I worried that he might not come back.

Then I would be alone too. 

I looked back down, flipping through the next few pages as Celene sat and waited to see if Gale would come back. I knew he hadn’t, but it was interesting to see his travels from a different point of view. Celene eventually left too, but she left him a note on his bulletin board so that he would know she was looking for him. That struck me as weird, because Gale had never mentioned seeing signs of her. When he talked about Celene it was always in the past tense. He didn’t expect to find her, and if he had ever found any sign of her, he had kept it to himself. 

What else could he have been keeping to himself, I wondered?

I flipped through a few more pages before landing on something that seemed interesting.

Today

I have officially been to every store between the start and the Christmas Store and I haven’t found Gale. I have seen sign of Gale, but I haven’t found him. I have decided to press on. These stores can’t go on forever, and maybe if I find the end, I’ll find Gale. It’s worth a shot.

Today

I’ve been to so many stores I have lost count. Time means nothing anymore. I’ve started carrying more food, however, when I find it because not all the stores have actual food. I went to a store on my travels that had nothin but plastic food on the shelves. There was another with rotten food in the packages. Some of them just sell the same item duplicated a thousand times. Some of them don’t sell anything, their just empty shelves and awful music. There is no end in sight, but I’m not giving up.

Today

Thirty stores today. Nothing edible

Today

I was attacked by bats in a large cave. I made it out, but just barely.

Today

I found a store where the products were made of people, and the people made of food shopped there. I’m not ashamed to say that I ate a few of them when they tried to corner me. I hadn’t actually eaten in three or four stops and my supplies are all but gone. One of them was made of popcorn, his blood cola. Another was made of celery and he bled ranch dressing. After I bit and savaged a couple of them, they moved, but I was still hungry. I ate four and a half of them before fleeing. I’ve got an arm made of prosciutto in my back and its oozing swiss cheese. Hopefully it will keep me.

Today

I saw some weird letters on the ground today. They told me I was in XX. I don’t know what that means, but the store looked like a little Japanese village and you could get food there. It was like a theme park kind of, and there was a bathouse where I took my first bath in a very long time. I ate and ate and ate until I thought I would burst and then soaked and slept and when it was finally time to go again, I was rested and refreshed.

Today

I saw a dog today. He didn’t appear to be in distress, but it was odd to see him. He followed me through the doors for a bit, whining for pets and seeming happy to see me, but eventually when I lay down to sleep, he left and went his own way. Poor thing can only move forward. What a frightening prospect. 

Today

I’ve gone back to my original store.

I’m not sure where I went, but if it's the end then I don’t want to go any further.

I stood looking into the bathroom door, something I’ve done a thousand times before, but on the other side was something different. The store I was in was a winter wonderland, complete with snow, but the other side was pitch black. Things were moving in there, and the longer I looked, the more I realized they were very large but far away. I don’t know what that was or what they were, but I couldn’t bring myself to walk through that door. I started crying, suddenly just wanting to be home, and when I stepped through I found myself right back where I started. It should have been demoralizing, it should have completely destroyed me, but it didn’t. Probably because I know that I can go back to the door anytime I want to. Probably because I know it will be there when I am ready, and I think that's the worst part of all.

I’m going to stay here for a while and consider what to do next.

I hope Gale finds me, but I have long ago given up hope of finding him.

C

That was the last entry, and I had no idea how long ago it had been.

Behind that page, stuffed between the next two like a bookmark, was a plastic name badge with Celene’s name on it in faded, press-on letters. 

Gale still hasn’t returned and I’m starting to get worried.

For that matter, how long had I been sitting here reading it?

I wanted him to see this. I want him to know that his friend is still out there. I can’t imagine whats keeping him, but I have a bad feeling about it. What if he doesn’t come back? What if killing that Hermit pushed him over the edge somehow? What if he blames me?

I don’t know what to do, but as I sit here writing this, I feel my eyes getting heavy.

It's been a long…well not Day but it's been long enough.

I’ll update soon.
