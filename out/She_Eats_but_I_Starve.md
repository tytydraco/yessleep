I think it was her scent that drew me in that late Tuesday afternoon. 

It was time for someone new and the stretch of road between the local grocery store and the shore was the perfect place to reel in a catch. 

My window was rolled down on my truck, the sun was warm and the breeze was gentle. 
Her back faced me as she made her way down the sidewalk leisurely. 
Initially, nothing drew me to her, not her straight black hair, not the white dress she was wearing, not even her oddly bare feet. 
Then the breeze brought it on the wind, a nostalgic scent that called to childhood memories of summers on the sand. 

That’s it, she’s the one. I pull up alongside her, crawling alongside her slowly. Her head turns deliberately and her smile blinds me. 
I’m almost struck dumb as all my usual ruses of asking for directions or recommendations for restaurants seemingly leak out of my ears. 
“Beautiful day isn’t it?”

Her steps are gliding, like she’s walking on water instead of a dilapidated sidewalk. Face bright, smile wide, her ice eyes so deep they drew you into the depths. 
“Yes it is.” I agreed, I shook my head a bit and sat up straighter. 
Determined to not be distracted, I put on a bright smile. 

“Actually, since it’s so nice out, I’m looking for a place to go and enjoy the sunshine. Do you-?”
Unable to finish my sentence as she’s already rounded my truck and hopped into the seat beside me. 
“Let’s go!”
I just stare at her for a few seconds, that was suspiciously easy. I’m not going to complain but she seems odd like she has no sense of danger. 

The car picks up speed as I press on the gas pedal, heading home. Feeling no remorse thinking of this stupid girl and what awaited her at my home as a result of her lack of common sense. 

I initially try to make conversation but her bright smile distracts me. I trail off several times and my brain feels hazy. I don’t even ask her name but neither does she. 

As we pull into the driveway of my home, I prepare for the questions, the struggle, the desperation to get away as I grab her arms and drag her from the truck. A rag at the ready to be stuffed into her mouth. 

There was no need for any of it. 

She was just as bright, just as joyful as when she hopped into my car. 
“Is this your house? How perfect for a little family! Can I see?”

“Uh sure.” I led her inside, her bare feet skipping into the hallway of my home happily. 
“Oh how spacious!”
Flouncing through my home almost like she’s floating, that white dress flipping behind her as she explores. 
“This is perfect.”

I come back to myself,
“Let me show you the downstairs.”
I open the door leading down to the basement, she hops down the stairs while humming to herself, I follow. 

There’s a room made of glass in the center of the room, the door a thick metal but none of it daunts her. 
It’s all so unnerving but she waltz’s right into the room I had prepared for her without any issue. 
It’s what I wanted from the beginning so why was I so wary?

I lock the door behind her, tucking the key back into my pocket. Turning to stare at me, she reaches her hands out and caresses the glass as if it’s a dear friend. 
Pressing firmly against the glass, the two-way intercom system squeaks to life as she speaks. 
“Are you going to keep me?”

I don’t answer. 
I walk to the wall opposite the door and slide a cabinet open. Hanging on hooks are some of my favorite toys, sharp razors, long chains, metal pliers, clamps, whips and more. 
I grab a chain to start, I turn and see her still pressed against the glass. 
I don’t know if it was the glare of the glass but she seemed to emanate light like a halo, her hair swaying as it does in water. 

She whispers this time
“I’d like to keep you.”
Her ever present smile seems sharp in the basement light, sending a shiver down my spine. 
What the hell? Who’s the real murderer between us? 

Shaking it off, I survey her. She carries nothing, not even a purse. Only that thin white dress that flows like foam. 
I approach the door, unlocking it, she turns to me but makes no motion to hide. Despite the long chain in my hand and my size. I duck under the frame to enter. 

I walk to her silently, I reach out and grasp her arm. Had the basement already chilled her skin this much? Why did it feel almost scaly? 

I turn her and there’s no resistance as I wrapped the chains around her wrists. I drag her to the hook in the middle of the room hanging from the ceiling. 
Hoisting her up so that she dangles from the hook like a fish. 
Her body is relaxed, swaying gently and shimmering almost in the light. 

Tilting that head and smiling that almost too sharp grin at me. 
“Could I have some water?”
So casually said that this could’ve been a restaurant instead of a place where death occurred. 

I was unnerved, she was perfect, just the type I normally liked to carve slowly and break down mentally over weeks till they begged for death. 
My catharsis, my joy and pride. 

I almost didn’t want to continue because she seemed to be visually pleasing already. Where I normally craved seeing delicately sliced swirls of flesh and blood, I beheld white shimmering skin. So white that it was almost blue, a bewitching light of aura making me sway to an unheard rhythm. 

“Sure.” The word croaking past my dry lips. 
Maybe I needed water too. 
It felt so dry here. 

Leaving her swaying, the door remains open as I grab cups of water from the kitchen and return. 
No signs of escape made, ice blue eyes tracking me like she’s not the prey here. 
I feel compelled to help her drink, no words shared between us as she almost seems to absorb the water rather than drink it. 

I gulp my own water down like I haven’t drank in days. Her eyes stay trained on me, body swinging gently despite no movement from her while those lips are stretched back over sharp teeth in an everlasting smile. 

I find myself sitting on the floor in a daze, I check the clock on the wall outside and it’s been hours since I brought her here. 
We’ve been here all day, not moving an inch as we just stared at each other. 

She’s not swaying anymore, her feet touch the floor. 
I let her down from the chains, I’m tired and I’ll come back tomorrow to do what I came to do. 
I closed the door behind me, the thought that I didn’t have to duck under the frame barely registering. 

The next morning, I wake ravenous so I immediately go to eat but nothing satiates me. 
Something inside me calls me towards what will. 
I work from home so I have a small office set up in the basement outside the glass room. 

It’s normal for me to head down here every morning.

I go downstairs and there she is, as perfect as yesterday. 
Her wide almost bulging eyes find me immediately and it’s her who lights up this basement rather than the light above. 

Work is forgotten as I enter her room. 

She seems to take up the entire pallet laid on the floor. 
Her mouth opens as she calls me forward with what sounds like bubbles popping and an open hand. 
I know I’m supposed to be the one in control here. 

I brought her here, I chose her but why did I feel like I’m caught in her net?

I grasped her hand, it’s cold like grabbing a can straight from the cooler. 
I noticed my fingers are thin compared to hers, I’m a tall man but her hand seems to dwarf mine. 

I should want to carve her into a beautiful piece of art just for me. 
I should want to leave my own finger painting on her throat as I listen to her gasping breaths. 
Instead I kneel there in reverence to this woman whose entire being entrances me. 

There’s a silence as she examines me, a rumbling noise coming from her as she drags a finger down my cheek, it’s so sunken I can feel her finger directly on my teeth. 
Like the skin and muscle were gone. 

Bringing her wrist to her gaping mouth, teeth slice through the blue skin and dark blood oozes. 

My mouth waters. 

I can’t move though as her body pulses with a calming light. It’s her who shoves it into my mouth. 
I drink hungrily. 

A bubbling laugh fills this glass room, it’s pleasant and I smile. 
My knees feel wet but I don’t mind. 
I feel weak and small, it’s okay. 
There’s black spines rising from her hair now, it’s beautiful. 

Those eyes are so big, the pupils are so large now that I’m sure she can see into my soul. 
That shimmering scaly skin brushes under my chin as I feed. 

I bring her what she needs. 
The first day I bring her water, so much water she needs a tub. 
Her gurgling pleased sounds are now my life’s music. 

The second day, she’s grown out of the tub so I bring her a small pool. 
It’s difficult to get down the stairs now and to reach the handle now but I manage. 
Hearing her sing and getting to drink are worth the pain, there’s no fat on my body anymore. 

Sometimes I catch a glimpse of myself in the reflection of the pool. 
Half of what I was, hair almost completely gone, my face is like rice paper drawn tight over a skull. 

It hurts to hold things, my hands have no padding and I feel the edges of the buckets I carry in my bones. 

She towers over me now, I no longer need to kneel to be below her but I do anyways on hard knees. 
Her hair is all but gone, a crown of black spines adorns her head instead. 
Her light fills the basement now, leaving water ripples to reflect everywhere. 
It’s dark everywhere else now but her light is all I need. 

My queen, the one who sustains me. 

I feel like a small child now, having to crawl up those stairs. 
It’s almost time for me to join with her completely. 
Soon I won’t have to crawl those stairs at all, I can be with her always. 
She fills almost the entirety of the glass room now, I’ve filled the room and basement with water. 

Fish inhabit the thick grass along the floor, there’s no light except what she brings. 
It’s home now. 

I share this story now on the computer I brought upstairs, the last trip I will make up those stairs before I return after posting this call to action. 

She has sisters who will soon join us up above. They will need you. 
Do not be afraid, they will take care of you. 

Do not fear the hunger for she will sustain. 
Do not hide from the light for she calls. 
Do not resist her scent because you have been chosen.
